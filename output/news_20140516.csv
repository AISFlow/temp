42397635,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDau9,1400279184,"All Things Alt: Advanced Algorithms, Maxcoin Reborn and a Second Lap for Dogecoin","UPDATE: Josh Wise has won the online NASCAR vote thanks to the dogecoin community's efforts.  According to NASCAR, Wise was quoted as saying:  ""That's unreal. I can't believe that. That's amazing. Thank you everybody watching.""  Wise and his team will now take part in tomorrow's 2014 Sprint All-Star Race in Charlotte.      It was another strong week in the world of alternative digital currencies, as several coins saw impressive price gains while developers sparked renewed activity in some established coin communities.  While there's always plenty of action in the alt world, here are some of the more noteworthy developments from the past week.  New life for Maxcoin?  Maxcoin, the altcoin championed by journalist and commentator Max Keiser, debuted to much fanfare earlier this year but stumbled following technical problems during the rollout.  The price spiked to roughly $3 within days, and fell just as quickly. As of this writing, the average price for a single maxcoin is just below US$0.05.  Yet, there may be renewed development taking place in the maxcoin community, according to a post on the Bitcoin Talk forum by one of the altcoin’s core developers, Luke Mitchell.  Mitchell said in a statement that maxcoin is alive and well, declaring:  ""The coin is still under development and is not going away any time soon. The MaxCoin community is growing and, despite the negative press it receives - of which much, I believe, is from people who hoped to ""get rich quick"", as goombaloon so succinctly mentions - we are working with developers on a number of MaxCoin related projects.""  Mitchell also dismissed rumors that he and the development team acted to secured large amount of maxcoins during launch as ""unfounded and false"".  CoinDesk reached out to Mitchell for comment but did not receive an immediate response.  Keiser himself recently fanned the flames of speculation of a maxcoin revival in a 14th May post to his Twitter account:    #Maxcoin is an easy double from here. @maxcoinproject @paradimeshift @PlanetPonzi      — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) May 14, 2014    Could maxcoin be making a comeback? The alt world will have to wait and see what Keiser and his team have up their sleeves.  Dogecar's second lap  NASCAR driver Josh Wise, beloved sports icon of the dogecoin community, may be getting a second chance behind the wheel of the crowdfunded Dogecar.  Wise is locked in a tight bid to follow up his impressive performance at Talladega last month at the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race on 17th May in Charlotte, North Carolina. Wise is one of a long list of drivers competing in an online vote, the winner of which gains entry into the race.  Participants can vote as many times as they wish. Since the contest was announced, the dogecoin community has undertaken a get-out-the-vote campaign ranging from Twitter posts, reddit bulletins and, as always, elaborately conceived YouTube videos.  Signs suggest that Wise, despite the odds, may succeed in his bid. According to a member of the dogecoin community on reddit claiming to have a connection inside NASCAR, Wise is currently in second place behind driver Danica Patrick.  Brisbane gains an alt-dispensing ATM  Queensland, Australia, has received its first bitcoin ATM at a local cafe in South Brisbane. In addition to bitcoin transactions, the machine will also provide support for litecoin and dogecoin.  The ATM, developed by Peru-based ATM manufacturer Bit2Bit, is located at The Roastery. Users will be able to buy and sell digital currency, as well as make BTC, LTC and DOGE withdrawals.  One of the co-owners of The Roastery, Bruce Carrall, told the Brisbane Times that the cafe launched the ATM to tap into the local passion for digital currencies, saying:  ""There’s a lot of people who have been waiting for this. There’s Bitcoiniacs who have meetings everywhere every week, and these groups are growing rapidly.""  Best of all, fans of litecoin and dogecoin will be able to use receipts from the machines to make purchases at the cafe. Next time you’re in South Brisbane with your DOGE wallet handy, you might want to think about stopping buy for a cup of coffee.  The rise of X11  In recent months, innovations have come out of the altcoin community that have pushed new mining approaches and algorithms into the fore. From Scrypt-N to Groestl, more advanced systems for veryifing transactions within the coin network are reshaping the altcoin landscape.  According to a document created by pool operator SuchPool.pw, X11 ""provides a very efficient way to mine coins"". The algorithm does not pose the same power needs as other proof-of-work digital currencies, results in lower heat ranges and and greater hardware longevity as a result.  Pioneered by darkcoin, X11 has slowly gained traction in terms of new coin implementation. Darkcoin, along with Hirocoin and québecoin, are perhaps the most notable examples of X11 coins. Additionally, the algorithm has been integrated by some elements of the multipool community, with several pools offering X11 as a mining option.  For altcoin miners, X11 presents an interesting alternative that could become more prominent within the ecosystem. Those hoping to increase the lifetime of their mining rigs may want to consider this new algorithm as a viable option.  Strange alt of the week  In a recent edition of All Things Alt, we highlighted facebookcoin, an altcoin which wandered into the risky legal area of trademark infringement.  The altcoin development community is at it again with thesmurfscoin, a proof-of-stake coin that relies on the loveable Smurf characters of 1980s cartoon fame.  Thesmurfscoin’s odd name and utilization of proprietary images from the recent The Smurfs feature films for its insignia has earned it this week’s Strange Alt of the Week award.  Unlike most new proof-of-stake coins, thesmurfscoin is launching without an initial proof-of-work phase, instead opting for a distribution phase executed by the developer. Forty percent of the coin’s 100m max supply was scheduled to be distributed to users, according to a post on Bitcoin Talk.  A multipool has been set up to provide buy support for thesmurfscoin, which thus far has only been listed on one exchange. Though, this strategy mirrors the multipool approach previously employed by members of the blackcoin community.  Have a tip about a notable happening in the altcoin world?

42397636,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDasB,1400275576,Bitcoin2014 Day One: Industry Seeks to Push Possibilities in Amsterdam,"The Bitcoin2014 conference kicked off in exuberant style with Patrick Byrne’s crash course in Western philosophy. From there the day went on to address bitcoin-backed securities, Circle’s long-awaited emergence from ‘stealth’ mode and the ‘State of Bitcoin’ as judged by Gavin Andresen, chief scientist for the Bitcoin Foundation.  Here are today’s highlights:    Overstock to issue bitcoin bonds?    Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne is no stranger to making big statements. In February, he told Wired the world was headed toward financial apocalypse, warning that ""someday, either zombies walk the Earth or something close to that … bitcoin is the solution"".  Today’s speech at Bitcoin2014 was light on zombies, but full of brainfood for the audience. After delighting the conference with his knowledge of political philosophy, Byrne revealed his ambition for Overstock.com to list on a block chain-backed stock exchange:    ""We could either issue securities in bitcoin and translate those and collect funds in dollars. I am less interested in that than just taking it and listing it, and maybe even creating a new security and issuing it through such an exchange.      Or, we could take our security, which is already publicly registered and publicly traded and just get it dual listed on somebody’s technology.""    Will it happen? Who knows. But after delivering on what he claimed to be off-hand comments about Overstock.com accepting bitcoin, there’s every chance that Byrne could again push the limits of what’s considered possible with bitcoin.    Circle emerges from the shadows    Unveiling at last Circle’s business plans  , CEO Jeremy Allaire made a wry jab at competitor Coinbase, noting that all new customers with Circle will get $10 worth of bitcoin free, not just those with .edu email addresses.  The announcement today ends months of speculation about Circle’s product offering – the company is offering a wallet and payment service for consumers that deliberately eschew the speculative language of bitcoin to-date.  There’s no 'buying' or 'selling' on the service, just 'depositing' and 'withdrawing'. Circle customers will also receive insurance against theft on their deposits.  It’s the most explicitly pro-mainstream offering from a bitcoin business to-date, but we’ll have a while to wait before we can properly judge its success.  Circle still isn’t fully open to the general public – you have to request an invite.    Gavin Andresen sounds the alarm    ""I still don't care about mining,"" teased the Bitcoin Foundation’s chief scientist in his State of Bitcoin speech today, except when it affects the experience of ordinary bitcoin uses. He headed into more serious territory and warned that transaction fees could ""rise and rise to the point where only rich people can transact"" if block sizes aren’t increased.  His speech covered the breadth of issues facing bitcoin today, including questions about privacy – Dark Wallet is ""fantastic"", he said – and regulation, which he called ""inevitable"".  Perhaps more importantly, though, he subtly criticized those in the community who consider certain ideas off-limits.  ""It’s hard to find a constructive place to talk about changes without people attacking people [just] for talking,"" he said.  For bitcoin, as for the rest of the Internet, trolls can be impediments to progress, it seems.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/16/bitcoin2014-day-one-industry-seeks-to-push-possibilities-in-amsterdam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9fda71c4bebf9bd41146c5273193367610db298-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397640,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDay5,1400272282,"The CoinDesk Mining Roundup: Mineral Oil, Bitmain and Scrypt-N","Last week, there were 1,145 blocks rewarded to miners, according to the Neighbourhood Pool Watch. Based on the recent price of BTC times the 25 coin reward, that's more than $12m.  At bitcoin's current price and network difficulty, the network is generating millions of dollars per week. But that's with miner operating costs notwithstanding.  For example, Dave Carlson's MegaBigPower pool earned 18 blocks last week, representing 1.57% a share of total rewards. That's about $200,000, and some of those spoils will need to go to running the datacenter that supports his pool.  With that in mind, here is what has been going on in the mining sector since our last roundup.  Mineral oil cooling  Using Radeon R9 280x GPUs to mine scrypt is becoming fairly inefficient due to the rise of the Gridseed miners. One enterprising DIY miner has decided to remove heat by dipping his GPUs in mineral oil, then extracting the heat using a car radiator.  There are a number of cooling options available for mining: Air, water and the use of treated fluids to cool miners.  Mineral oil is an interesting option, not only because it looks unique - you can see heat dissipating off of the oil - but also due to the fact that it can be quite messy. Nevertheless, it does work and miners building their own custom rigs are clearly using it to reduce heat generation.  HashFast founders broke  San Francisco-based HashFast, a mining designer and manufacturer, has been having a number of problems. It recently had to lay off half of its staff and told Ars Technica that the company is broke - although they have denied bankruptcy rumors.  ""The only thing that is holding us back is that we are as poor as church mice,"" CEO Eduardo de Castro said.  HashFast had reportedly taped out a 28nm chip that could hash at 400GH/s last September. However, the company has had a number of problems. For example, in March the company had its bitcoin wallet frozen by a Fort Worth, Texas court.  In a guest post by Dario Di Pardo for CoinDesk about purchasing mining equipment, Di Pardo wrote he had lost confidence in the company, and has requested a refund.  Innosilicon A2 Terminator    ASIC scrypt mining is heating up, and perhaps the best example of this is Innosilicon's A2 Terminator.      The 28nm chip is capable of operating at a minimum of 1.6MH/s per 10 watts. That means a 150MH/s unit would use 1KW. Innosilicon, a Wuhan, China-based manufacturer, will sell these chips to makers of complete mining rigs.    One of those companies is Gridseed, one of the first producers of scrypt-based mining units. Gridseed has told CoinDesk that it already has built a blade form factor unit using the A2 Terminator called the G-BOX.  The Gridseed G-BOX is expected to produce 70MH/s of scrypt power per unit. That would be a major step up from Gridseed's current G Blade, which hashes at 5.2MH/s while using 140W.  Bitmain Antminer S2 upgrades  China-based Bitmain, which has reportedly been delivering on its shipment promises, will offer its existing Antminer S2 customers an upgrade. The company is currently selling the Antminer S2 units with 1TH/s of power at 1.2KW.  However, a recent Bitcoin Talk forum post indicates that the company will sell upgrade packages to these units that could double the S2's power to 2TH/s, available this fall.  Bitmain's only other product right now is the Antminer U2+, a USB stick that generates 2GH/s at 2.95W. It is selling a minimum order of 500 U2+ units for 10.8. Bitmain also seems to have an agreement with 112 Bit, a US-based distributor of Bitmain products, to provide hosting for the company's hardware.  BFL Monarch update    Kansas-based ButterflyLabs has released an update on its Monarch blade form factor miner. The 28nm unit, which is expected to perform at 600GH/s for $2,196, is said to have better power performance over its industry rivals.      According to the update, the Monarch will be three-to-five times more efficient than the competition. The base Monarch is expected to draw 235W of power, and another version, called the Imperial Monarch, will have 1TH/s of power at 550W.      Although the Monarch's initial test chips were produced back in January, shipment of units has been delayed. Recently, it was reported that consumers have appealed to the Federal Trade Commission to investigate over $1m in alleged unfulfilled orders from BFL.    Flower Tech scrypt-N  Canada-based Flow Technology is focusing on scrypt - and also scrypt-n, which has been supposedly ASIC-resistant. The company's $7,900 rack-mount Liliac unit is expected to hash at 300MH/s at 1.8W per megahash. The units are scheduled to start shipping in Q3 of 2014.  The company does have two other products for scrypt mining - a 10MH/s standalone unit called the Daisy and a 60MH/s blade called the Orchid. However, these units also have a Q3 2014 target ship date.  There are now a number of coins promoting themselves as protected from ASIC mining because of scrypt-N including vertcoin. But if Flower Technology is able to produce a miner that can hash both scrypt and scrypt-N, that could have some serious implications for the altcoin mining market.

42397627,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDalI,1400269586,Bitcoin Businesses Detail Banking Setbacks at US Task Force Hearing,"Representatives from several bitcoin businesses told a panel of state banking regulators today that the current regulatory environment is making it difficult for them to build partnerships with banks.  Executives from BitPay, Xapo, SecondMarket and CoinX spoke before a meeting of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) Emerging Payments Task Force in Chicago.  During a roughly two-hour hearing, these bitcoin industry representatives suggested that without clearer and supportive regulatory standards, bitcoin companies will continue to be held back in the broader consumer marketplace.  Bryan Krohn, BitPay’s chief financial officer, told the panel that the current regulatory environment makes it difficult to do business with a bank in the first place, saying:  ""Banks are just backing away. The cost for doing this is too burdensome, and they just say no.""  The panel members agreed that aligning regulations for bitcoin businesses with those applied to traditional money services businesses (MSBs) would help alleviate the situation.  Too risky for banks  Megan Burton, CEO of digital currency exchange CoinX, told the task force that regulatory uncertainty impairs communication between bitcoin businesses and banks.  She remarked that more clarity would improve the situation, saying:  ""There needs to be a bridge between where we are as a MSB in a high-risk category and where the banks are, and how they’re being regulated, to be able to facilitate better communication between the two.""  Annemarie Tierney, general counsel and legal EVP for SecondMarket, told the panel that the high-risk profiling recently cost the company a long-time banking relationship.  She said:  ""[The bank] gave us notice yesterday that they wanted to end that banking relationship, in part because our transitions around bitcoin, even though we’re not an MSB or an exchange, [it] raised our risk profile and it was too much work for them to figure it out.""  Tierney added that the termination was ""very, very discouraging"" for the company.  Compliance holds banks back  The panel told the task force that, despite these challenges, banks have expressed interest in the technology underlying bitcoin. Still, issues with regulatory compliance make banks wary of the potential costs of investing in or integrating digital currency.  Karsten Behrend, chief compliance officer for Xapo, said the company has spoken with banks about the aspects of digital currency and how the technology could be leveraged for their clients. He remarked that doing so has helped Xapo educate potential banking partners on bitcoin.  Burton added that CoinX demoed her company’s exchange technology to two US-based banks in September 2013. However, the banks passed on any involvement with the technology because of the perceived high risk.  She explained:    ""Once we did a demo of the system, the platform and the exchange in particular. They were fascinated as to how we can extend this to our consumers.      Ultimately, they came up against a roadblock that, because of the risk profile, it would put additional scrutiny that they would not be able to handle within their organization.""    Members of the task force, at the conclusion of the hearing, suggested that a national banking regulatory standard for digital currencies could be developed.  The group said that it would publish its findings later in the year as it moves toward potentially establishing new or modified guidelines for bitcoin businesses.

42377214,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zy8v,1400253857,China May Be Disrupting Access to Major Bitcoin Websites,"The Chinese government may be moving to suppress bitcoin adoption by limiting access to popular industry websites such as Blockchain, BTC-e and Coinbase, sources say.  The reports follow the revelation that the Chinese government had sought to limit domestic media coverage ahead of last week's Beijing-based conference Global Bitcoin Summit, and that more extensive press restrictions have been implemented domestically.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Bitcoin Foundation board member-elect and BTC China CEO Bobby Lee confirmed that local web users had reported difficulty accessing certain popular bitcoin websites via PC computers:  ""The blocking of these websites seems to be selective, affecting different parts of China at different times, for different durations.""  He suggested that the Chinese government may be mounting an effort to destabilize these sites to give the appearance that they are unreliable.  He further noted that the actions are not unprecedented, as China has previously taken steps to block users from accessing websites such as Google.  Affected sites  Though the full number of websites potentially affected by these issues is not yet known, sources told CoinDesk that a handful of the more notable bitcoin companies were affected.  Eric Gu, co-founder of venture capital firm BitAngelsClub, said that news of the website issues was first reported yesterday, explaining:  ""Some people weren't able to access Blockchain wallets, and then we realized that BTC-e, and Coinbase were also on and off.""  VC investor and CoinDesk contributor Rui Ma also took to Twitter to list some websites that were suspected of having been affected, noting that the issues were not observed on the companies' mobile websites.

42377222,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyHj,1400248601,Gavin Andresen: Rising Transaction Fees Could Price Poor Out of Bitcoin,"Transaction fees could “rise and rise to the point where only rich people can transact” if block sizes aren’t increased, according to Gavin Andresen, Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation.  Speaking at the Bitcoin2014 conference today, Andresen warned that if steps aren’t taken to either increase the rate at which blocks are created or to persuade miners to include more transactions in each block (therefore increasing their size), transaction fees could skyrocket.  In the annual ‘State of Bitcoin’ address at the Amsterdam event, Andresen also called the Dark Wallet project “fantastic”, saying that “more privacy is better” and rejecting the distinction that technology is good or bad: “Technology is what it is. Regulations will evolve and the software will evolve [too].”  Explaining his decision to step down as bitcoin’s lead developer in April, Andresen said “as the [bitcoin] project gets bigger, it makes sense to specialize.” That move is part of a wider strategy of specialization that includes the bitcoin code itself, he explained:  “We’re trying to modularise the code more. Satoshi gave us a bit of hairball – we’re teasing apart the different pieces of functionality, because as you grow you want to specialize.”  Success not guaranteed  Touching on so-called 'Bitcoin 2.0' projects such as MasterCoin and Ethereum, Andresen suggested they might meet the same fate as the Segway: “Segways are really cool, but they're not mainstream. A lot of Bitcoin 2.0 projects might find the same thing.”  He also noted that the community wouldn’t discover whether such projects were truly secure until they were already protecting valuable assets, a chicken-and-egg problem that bitcoin also faced:  “We didn’t find out that bitcoin was not secure until it gained a value and became interesting to attack. The very first version of bitcoin was horribly unsecure.”  Bitcoin transactions take priority  More generally, Andresen reassured the audience that the main focus for bitcoin’s core developers is still to ensure “the core bitcoin network processes transaction as reliably as possible” and announced that Cory Fields, a bitcoin core developer, is now employed full-time by the Bitcoin Foundation to work on the Bitcoin Core code.  Taking questions from the floor, he defended his comments about mining and transaction fees, saying that they are a matter of “pure supply and demand”, but said he was open to being persuaded otherwise.  Earlier in his talk he said, “I still don’t care about mining [except] in the way it affects user experiences. I’ve been really concerned about the number of transactions miners include in their blocks.”  With regards to the future development of bitcoin, Andresen said that creating good forums for discussion was crucial, and joked that he really wanted someone “to solve the Internet troll problem.”  Image by Kadhim Shubber",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/16/gavin-andresen-rising-transaction-fees-could-price-poor-out-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a425f7131cf9d01239c0218ed3765b4b4772bcd1-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nod to Pay was designed for Google Glass and an early public beta is now available for download directly from the developer.  The app currently supports bitcoin wallets from Blockchain and Coinbase, and Eaze says it plans to add support for other wallets in the future.  OK Glass, make a payment  Due to the unique Google Glass user interface, Nod to Pay is somewhat different to set up than your average smartphone payments app, and sending bitcoin involves a bit more than a simple nod of the head, too.  Initially, users must link their existing wallets by scanning a QR code.  Then, to use the voice-activated app, the user needs to say “OK Glass, make a payment.” At which point, the device scans the QR code of any point-of-sale (POS) application and displays the details on the Glass display.  The next step is the nod. Nods, in fact, as the user needs to tilt the head twice to send the payment.  Due to the novel way transactions are confirmed, Eaze plans to implement an additional security level: simply, a spending limit will be set, above which PIN authentication is required.  Wearable innovation  Eaze says Nod to Pay offers a ""truly handsfree"" payment solution.  “We are proud to be the first to bring a global payment solution to Google Glass. After our announcement of Nod To Pay in February, we worked hard to make our product available to the public,” said Eaze co-founder Rutger van Zuidam, adding:  “With the integration of Coinbase and Blockchain.info we have also answered to the request of the market by building not yet another wallet but by making existing wallets available on Glass.”  Although the concept has been around since 2012, it was only this week that Google finally started selling Glass to the general public. At $1,500 the price seems rather steep, but it's worth bearing in mind that Glass was conceived as an elaborate tech demo rather than an actual consumer product – Google’s way of fostering innovation in the emerging wearables market.  A number of developers used the opportunity to come up with new concepts and ports of existing services to this unique form factor. A team of New York-based developers introduced the first Google Glass payment app last year, but GlassPay was designed specifically for use in bricks-and-mortar stores.  Like them or not, wearables are coming, and many developers are experimenting with a wide range of different applications, including digital wallets for smart watches and smart glasses.  With the launch of Android Wear and the latest Google Wallet update, development efforts in this niche are starting to pick up, albeit slowly.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/16/nod-to-pay-app-lets-google-glass-wearers-spend-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ab96dbb0d24bfe862c1a3aeac3c8ca1998160d4-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377227,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyO1,1400239569,"Overstock CEO Delivers Keynote to 1,000+ Attendees at Bitcoin2014","The Bitcoin2014 conference kicked off today in the Netherlands with a keynote address from Overstock CEO and bitcoin enthusiast Patrick Byrne.  Byrne delivered his keynote speech to a large portion of the 1,100 registered participants at the conference gathered in the Passenger Terminal in Amsterdam.  The talk was an information-heavy lesson in the historical context of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Byrne used historical great thinkers like Marx, Hegel and Kant, as well as modern-day academics like Francis Fukayama, to explain why he backs the cryptocurrency revolution.  “As much as I love bitcoin, I am all about the crypto revolution,” said Byrne, who has been previously called the ‘Bitcoin Messiah’.  Today he was introduced as a “true pioneer” and a “leader in exposing Wall Street corruption” by Jon Matonis, the Executive Director of Bitcoin Foundation and CoinDesk Contributing Editor.  The Bitcoin conference is organised annually by the Bitcoin Foundation. The last year's event was held in San Jose, California, and Matonis has revealed that the Foundation is looking to Asia for next year’s conference.  The 1,100 registered participants at the conference come from more than 50 countries.  “We truly believe this is the bitcoin event of the year to go to,” said Matonis.  Matonis also showed the following video about bitcoin empowering people in Uganda to the audience.  Bitcoin philosopher  Byrne, who is a self-confessed libertarian and 'Austrian economist', drew on his triple degrees to deliver a philosophically rooted argument about the importance of bitcoin.  The two centralized institutions that were most undermined by cryptocurrencies were the central banks and central counterparty clearing, he argued.  Byrne became the poster boy for bitcoin when he announced late last year that Overstock.com would start accepting bitcoin. He had originally made an offhand remark in an interview last December, saying he was considering bitcoin for the business. The news blew up and he delivered on his promise.  Today, he joked about that and said:  “I said maybe by the end of 2014 [we would accept bitcoin]. I said it off the top off my head, but that mention started appearing in newspapers around the world.”  Big plans  Staying true to his style, during the question and answer round today Byrne revealed that he had plans for potentially listing his company on “a block chain kind of a stock exchange.”  Watching his words, he said: “I would already be interested in issuing a bond or something, so we could be the first to list this sort of security.”  He revealed that Overstock was in the early stages of looking at the legal propriety of dual listing on NASDAQ and another stock exchange. While they have not ironed out any concrete plans, he said:  “We could either issue securities in bitcoin and translate those and collect funds in dollars. I am less interested in that than just taking it and listing it and maybe even creating a new security and issuing it through such an exchange. Or we could take our security, which is already publicly registered and publicly traded and just get it dual listed on somebody’s technology.”  Byrne is still weighing his options, but there might be a concrete announcement from his company in the next couple of months, he indicated.  Overstock is one of the world’s largest online retailers, making more than $1.3bn in annual sales under Byrne’s leadership. When Overstock first accepted bitcoin, it was suggested that Byrne was doing so to get publicity, a point that he also addressed in today’s keynote, saying:  “A lot of people suggested that I got involved in bitcoin for the publicity. I hope my talk today has dispelled this.”  Wearing a Shanghai Tang suit, Byrne even showed off his Chinese language skills during the Q&A round.  Drawing on his business expertise, scholarly training and bitcoin enthusiasm, he set the right tone for rest of the conference.  Matonis and Byrne were only two of the 120 speakers slated to speak this weekend.

42377220,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyGT,1400230833,Safello Partners with Jumio for Instant ID Verification,"Sweden-based bitcoin exchange Safello has announced a new partnership with payments validation and ID verification service provider Jumio in an effort to simplify its customer onboarding process.  Launched in March, Jumio's Bitcoin Identity Security Open Network (BISON) provides consumers the ability to verify their identity by holding an ID in front of a camera or connected device. Data can then be extracted in real-time and used to quickly populate necessary enrollment forms.  Frank Schuil, CEO and co-founder of Safello, explained that the partnership will allow the exchange to better cater to consumers who want to buy or sell bitcoins quickly in the 11 countries it now serves, saying:  ""We have optimised our platform for the quickest turnaround time as we don't require such initial deposits, but instead execute the trade directly to the market.""  Schuil framed the new service as one that gives the bitcoin exchange an important value-add at a time when popular peer-to-peer exchanges have cumbersome deposit requirements.  With the news, Safello becomes one of the more notable bitcoin companies using Jumio's BISON technology, joining a list that includes Canadian ATM provider BitAccess and digital currency trading platform CoinMkt.  Eye on Europe  Sara Lindqvist, Safello's compliance officer, is enthusiastic about the partnership, noting that it will allow the company to better serve members of the European bitcoin community.  Lindqvist explained how Safello introduced a Mobile Bank ID verification method earlier this year, but that this upgrade was limited to the exchange's Swedish customers:  ""[Mobile Bank ID verification] significantly improved the conversion rate and our customers loved it. We set out to find an equally reliable and compliant solution for the rest of Europe and found Jumio to fit all of our requirements.""  Ambitious goals  Launched in July 2013, Safello has set its sights high with a number of ambitious announcements, raising $600,000 in funding in February and proclaiming in April that it intends to become ""CoinBase for Europe"", comparing its efforts to the widely used US wallet and exchange.  Safello has also been active in other segments of the bitcoin industry – for example, in December, the company launched the first bitcoin ATM in Sweden.  The company's CEO, also notably ran as a candidate in the most recent Bitcoin Foundation board member election, though he did not proceed to the final round of voting.

42377212,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zy6P,1400213402,Circle Reveals Roadmap for Bringing Bitcoin to Mainstream Market,"Following two of the industry's largest funding rounds and months of relative silence on its plans for entering the market, Boston-based bitcoin startup Circle has revealed new details about its service and how it plans to bring digital currency to mainstream consumers.  In a new blog post, penned jointly by CEO Jeremy Allaire and CFO Sean Neville, Circle seeks to define its approach to popularizing the industry, emphasizing the specific branding choices the company has made and ultimately answering a question many in the community have long been asking: ""What is Circle?""  Allaire and Neville explained:    ""We’re an Internet-based consumer finance company. We believe that digital money platforms and associated consumer products and services will revolutionize the way the world uses money.      We want to help people store and use digital money anywhere in the world.""    Perhaps most notably, Circle revealed its intention to act as a ""digital custodian"" for its customers, allowing consumers to access bitcoin without running bitcoin software, managing private keys or storing bitcoin in a secure location.  In their place, Circle plans to offer a secure network architecture audited by a national cybersecurity firm, one that will incorporate best practices such as multi-signature transactions and offline cold storage vaults, as well as free insurance on deposits.  The post  follows the formal unveiling of Circle.com at Bitcoin2014, an ongoing bitcoin conference taking place this weekend in Amsterdam.  Allaire is scheduled to speak at the event as part of a keynote speech entitled 'Bitcoin's Mainstream Moment' to take place on Friday at 11:30am local time (BST +1).  Emphasizing bitcoin's utility  An essential aspect of Circle's strategy, the post suggests, will be to focus on the utility value bitcoin can provide consumers, while removing the emphasis on its ""speculative nature"".  As such, the statements find Circle aiming to distance itself from competitors that it believes appeal more to currency and commodity traders:  ""We want to make it easy for consumers to deposit and convert currency into a digital form that they can then use globally and instantly, not offer a trading exchange for investors to bet on a speculative asset.""  In practice, this suggests Circle will provide similar services to bitcoin exchanges and wallet and storage providers – essentially housing these functionalities to remove some of the pain points commonly associated with digital currencies.  Rewriting bitcoin's vocabulary  Circle also discussed how it will attempt to brand the different elements of its service.  For example, customers will be able to ""deposit"" money with Circle, thereby instantly converting fiat money into bitcoin, and ""withdraw"" money via the service, converting bitcoin into local currency that can then be transferred to a bank.  The news notably follows the rebranding of Las Vegas-based bitcoin ATM provider Robocoin as an online bank in May. That announcement saw Robocoin discarding terms such as 'buy' and 'sell' in favor of more consumer-friendly terms like 'deposit' and 'withdraw'.  ""The metaphors are deposits, withdrawals, sending, and spending – not buying, selling, and exchanging,"" Circle explained.  Security practices  The post also elaborated on how Circle will seek to act as a digital custodian for its customers' funds.  For example, Circle noted that it works with both white- and black-hat hackers to ensure its system is safe from cyberattacks, maintains geographically distributed secure vaults and keeps 100% of its customer deposit value in its reserves.  Although, it acknowledged that some issues could arise with safety and security, stating:  ""During a time when large bitcoin exchanges have collapsed from the theft of digital assets, this is certainly a tall task.""  Circle in action  To entice consumers, Circle is also discarding the elements of the bitcoin buying process that it believes mainstream consumers will find cumbersome. Most notably, the company will offer instant access to bitcoin and store bitcoin for customers, free of charge.  Circle is also making a concerted effort to educate new consumers on how to use its service, noting it is ""investing in customer support, including offering telephone support from day one"".  To enroll and store existing bitcoin, customers will need to provide only a phone or email address. Those who want to connect a bank account or credit/debit card to Circle, by comparison, will need to provide additional information such as their name and residential address.  Interested consumers can now sign up for Circle, though the company is still conducting invitation-only beta testing.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/16/circle-reveals-roadmap-for-bringing-bitcoin-to-mainstream-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea0bba7763d460373c620ea4b98c368bbff88c46-1037x640.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
