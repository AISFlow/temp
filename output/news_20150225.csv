42378040,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lv2n,1424907732,Bitcoin Foundation Trials Blockchain Voting in Latest Election Controversy,"As perhaps an extension of its recent focus on revitalizing its image, the Bitcoin Foundation announced yesterday it would allow its members to cast votes in its latest election round directly on the bitcoin blockchain, the digital currency’s public ledger.  Billed in a blog post as a way for the Bitcoin Foundation to advance blockchain technology by new executive director Patrick Murck, the decision was soon met with mixed reactions, with some lauding the novel step and others criticising it for a potential negative impact on an election meant to fill two outgoing board member positions.  At issue was a process described as cumbersome by candidates such as CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium’s (C4) Michael Perklin and decried as a veiled way for the organisation to prevent voter participation by entrepreneur and candidate Olivier Janssens.  Met with this feedback, the foundation pulled the plug on the blockchain-based voting system at 16:00 EST, rendering all votes cast through its new system invalid and effectively restarting the voting process.  Remarking on the experiment, Murck strived to paint the day’s events as understandable due to the varying philosophical views those in the industry have regarding the use of the bitcoin blockchain for non-financial purposes. However, he sought to paint the blockchain-based voting system as the kind of initiative that should be embraced by the trade organisation.  Murck told CoinDesk:  “I’m glad we pushed it, because somebody needed to actually do something along these lines. You need to push for innovation on the blockchain and experimentation, I think that’s something the foundation should do, especially when it comes to pushing for innovation around governance, so in that sense it’s good.”  In interviews, candidates were similarly positive about the idea of the Bitcoin Foundation pushing forward on matters of innovation, even if they expressed fears that the stop-start nature of the current election may have an impact on voters.  “It will affect the process, everything affects the process, and when you have so few votes, every vote counts,” candidate and Atlantic Financial managing director Bruce Fenton said.  Others mainly expressed optimism that a return to a prior voting system would at least allow attention to be returned to the voting process itself.  “I was unable to vote for myself, and after waiting five hours, I was still presented an error message. So, if I couldn’t even vote for myself. I’m glad they pulled the plug and went back,” Perklin added.  Blockchain voting version 1.0  Announced in the early morning hours of 25th February, the Bitcoin Foundation’s blockchain-based voting attempt was made possible through a collaboration with decentralised crowdfunding startup Swarm.  As explained by CEO Joel Dietz, the system provided each eligible voter with a hierarchical-deterministic (HD) wallet that issued users a colored coin, or denomination of bitcoin augmented to represent an asset that could then be sent to ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ wallet addresses for each candidate.  Users were then informed of their ability to vote by email, a part of the system that seems to have posed challenges under the stress of real use.  For example, Bitcoin Foundation members took to Reddit to outline their confusion over receiving multiple emails, a concern that Dietz remarked seemed to be “main concern” shortly after the system was made live. Four emails were sent signifying that candidates could cast a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ vote for each candidate.  Others raised issues about whether the platform would work on mobile devices and whether the voting process could be manipulated by miners who could filter out transactions meant to signify displays of confidence for a particular candidate.  Dietz indicated the blockchain voting system has been in the works since December when Swarm was presented with specifications for an assignment.  “It was fairly clear but there was a bit of a wrinkle at the last minute of how to accommodate ‘approval voting’,” Dietz added, referring to the system by which members can cast their approval for each involved candidate.  Starting a conversation  Murck indicated that, issues aside, most criticisms were directed at the idea of using the bitcoin blockchain for voting, as opposed to the Swarm system itself.  “I think that that’s the dialogue that’s worth having in the community. If we help spark that dialogue, I think it’s timely and I think that it’s important that we have it,” Murck said, citing how the move brought new entrants into the conversation such as developer Gregory Maxwell.  Murck indicated that the foundation made voters aware of the potential for issues at launch. The initial blog post, for instance, advised that there was “a real risk” some members might not have a seamless experience.  Candidates were also mixed on the decision, as Perklin suggested that voicing doubt in the system may have led others to criticize it more vocally.  “What we don’t know is whether that sentence that everyone read prompted people to become so polarized about it. Maybe if that option wasn’t on the table, people would have been more open to embracing the new technology, but probably not,” he said.  Neither Fenton or Perklin suggested they were aware of the decision to implement blockchain-based voting, though both suggested they would have likely objected to the idea of testing the technology during an election.  “One of the biggest criticisms of the foundation that I’ve had is lack of transparency. We kind of wonder how are decisions made and who makes these decisions and why aren’t people included. I think the four candidates as stakeholders would have been logical people to reach out to see if we were in agreement or not,” he said.  Unanimous objection  As opposition to the voting system built over the course of the day, candidates began reaching out to the foundation in the hopes of inspiring it to switch back to the Helios voting system, which uses more traditional means of ballot encryption.  Eventually, all four candidates, including Fenton, Janssens, Perklin and former Bitcoin Foundation global policy counsel Jim Harper signed off on the switch.  “That was important, before we roll back into the system, we wanted to make sure all the candidates were onboard,” Murck said.  Perklin and Fenton were mixed on the day’s events, each voicing their concern that the upheaval could lead some voters to tune out of the election altogether.  “Unfortunately, I think that will be a factor,” Perklin continued. “Before the problem was a technical barrier that would have left out some percentage, now there’s going to be a different percentage left out for apathy reasons.”  Murck, however, strived to put the day’s issues in context, noting that complaints about the Helios voting system were common when it was first introduced.  “Whenever you use a system and you put it out to the world, you’re going to get real-world usage and real-world problems and it will show the cracks in blockchain voting, and that’s a good thing because other people will be able to see it, and other people will be able to innovate and that’s important,” he added.  At press time, the totals for the canceled round of voting placed Janssens and Harper in the lead with 59 Yes votes and 58 Yes votes, respectively.  Latest hiccup  The issues with blockchain-based voting are the latest in what has been an election cycle marked with minor community controversies.  For example, candidates had previously taken to criticizing the foundation for its efforts at spreading awareness about the voting, suggesting a low voter turnout caused by a lack of overall participation and awareness was likely to influence results.  Further, the election was complicated on 20th February when the first round of voting ended with no candidates receiving the more than 50% of the vote needed to secure a seat.  As a result of the change, the deadline for voting will be extended one extra day to 28th February, with final results being revealed on 1st March.

42378029,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LurT,1424902579,Banking Trade Group Proposes Database for US Bitcoin Companies,"The American Bankers Association (ABA) has called for the creation of a national database of digital currency companies and exemptions for banks from future licensing requirements.  The proposals were outlined in a 16th February letter sent to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), an organization made up of state banking regulators that released a draft framework for digital currency licenses in December.  The licensure framework approach is being adopted by New York and is under discussion by other US states like New Jersey. The CSBS has also held hearings on the subject of bitcoin regulation in the past.  The ABA  counts American banking giants like JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America Merrill Lynch among its membership, as well a large network of small and medium-sized banks in the US. The ABA was among a number of organizations that issued comments during a 60-day period that followed the release of the draft proposal.  The group called on the CSBS to produce a licensure framework that would homogenize oversight of digital currency businesses between state regulatory agencies. Its letter was in response to a series of questions posted by the CSBS in their proposal.  While the letter points to bitcoin and other digital currencies as innovative forces in the area of payments, the ABA argued that the CSBS should adopt a licensure-based framework because of the systemic risks it sees with bitcoin. The organization acknowledged that these risks have yet to have an impact on the broader financial system, noting:  “Although none of these failures have yet to feed directly through to the traditional payments system, as virtual currency usage grows it will become more tied to our traditional payments system. In the future, such failures could have system-wide consequences.”  In addition to arguing for a data-sharing system and exemptions for banks from new rules, the ABA called for companies that hold digital currencies for customers to be subject to the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA), adhere to know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules, and pay fully into state-funded insurance schemes or trust funds prior to access.  National database proposed  The concept of sharing information between state banking regulators about companies handling bitcoin was included in the draft proposal from the CSBS.  “A critical piece of such a [licensure] system is the ability of states to share licensing and enforcement data in real time,” the organization proposed at the time.  The ABA suggested modeling a national database of digital currency firms on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System, a registry of mortgage brokers and originators launched in 2008 that was later expanded to cover a broader range of financial services.  “Such a registry would allow regulators to verify a business’s status in other states and allow consumers to ensure that a business is registered before doing business with it,"" the ABA wrote.  On fraudulent transactions  The CSBS proposal suggested that digital currency businesses fall under federal statutes including the EFTA. The ABA cited Regulation E as a means for regulators to assign liability in instance of fraud, but outlined how applying the statute could prove complex given the nature of bitcoin transactions.  ""As bitcoin transactions are irreversible once posted to the blockchain, consumers have no recourse to reclaim their funds,"" the organization wrote. ""If Regulation E applied, wallet providers would be responsible for making customers whole following fraudulent transactions just as banks are.""  The ABA goes on to say only in instances where a wallet provider has knowledge of both transaction parties would fraud claims be relatively simple to settle, noting:  ""It will be difficult to apply Regulation E to direct transactions between customers that have no prior relationship or agreement to participate under any rules regarding reversals of payments. Without the participation of a clearing house or payment network, virtual currency transactions are the equivalent of cash changing hands in the street.""  ""When your pocket is picked Gucci doesn’t reimburse you for your loss,"" the ABA added.  Bank carveout requested  In its letter, the ABA called for a ""level playing field"" among companies offering service in the payments space, suggesting that competition in the marketplace would be stifled otherwise.  The ABA wrote:  ""All participants in the payments system should operate by a similar set of rules and standards. This ensures that all participants have parallel financial incentives to innovate, and eliminates anomalies in the market driven solely by government policies that apply to some players but not others.""  Arguing that banks are already regulated under what it characterized as significant oversight, the ABA requested that the CSBS consider proposing exemptions for banking institutions under future digital currency licensure regimes.  ""Subjecting banks to duplicative regulations would add no additional protections to consumers, and would divert bank resources from serving their communities,"" the letter stated.

42378045,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lv7p,1424898024,CoinJar Swipe Bitcoin Debit Cards Now Available,"Australian bitcoin services company CoinJar has opened up its debit card service CoinJar Swipe to the general public.  The cards allow users to spend from their bitcoin accounts at over 820,000 retail terminals nationwide, as well as withdraw cash from bank ATMs.  Notably, the new system means there is no waiting for banks to clear fund transfers from CoinJar exchange accounts.  CoinJar announced the launch at the Payment Innovations 2015 conference in Sydney today. The Swipe system had been an invite-only trial since September, with about 61 users spending AU$30,000 in that period.  The company, which recently shifted its global headquarters to London, is also planning to launch its full suite of products, including the debit card, in the United Kingdom this year.  Lifestyle purchases  CoinJar's data shows nearly two-thirds of the transactions made with its debit cards so far have been for everyday purchases at cafes, bars, supermarkets and variety stores.  Marketing Lead Samuel Tate told CoinDesk that users with CoinJar Swipe ""showed a significant increase in their overall transactional activity throughout the trial"", proving, he said, that tools like Swipe are key in driving the mainstream adoption of bitcoin.  Tate said bitcoin holders want to use their digital currency for more than just trading or peer-to-peer transfers, adding:  ""We’re working to make bitcoin a stable and more useful digital currency for everyone, and we believe the release of CoinJar Swipe is one of the missing pieces to that puzzle.""  Loading the account  Users need to load up their debit cards manually with dollars before spending, though the conversion is managed by CoinJar's exchange. The company is planning an automated loading feature in future that would allow users to set a minimum balance to be maintained.  Once loaded, the cards function the same as any bank-issued debit card and can be used at any business in Australia that is part of the widely-adopted EFTPOS debit network.  While there is a $29 initial fee to obtain a CoinJar Swipe card, the company promised in September there would be ""no activation fees, no load fees, no conversion rates (subject to CoinJar Fair Rate policy), [and] no inactivity fees"".  While some ATM networks will charge a fee for cash withdrawals, users can make withdrawals for free at the Coles and Woolworths supermarket chains.  ""Digital currency is the future, but to make it useful right now it has to tap into the existing banking infrastructure. That’s why something like CoinJar Swipe is so important,"" said Tate.  New products  CoinJar also recently launched a revamped mobile exchange/wallet app and is introducing a product called 'hedged accounts' for users nervous about bitcoin price volatility.  Hedged accounts enable customers to set their bitcoin holding at a fiat currency value in their choice of AUD, USD, GBP or EUR.  If a user holds $500-worth of bitcoins today, they can lock in that value to access $500 in bitcoins at any point in future. While convenient for nervous users worried about bitcoin price drops, it would also exclude them from profits should the value rise instead.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/25/coinjar-swipe-bitcoin-debit-cards-now-available,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb0fe0647dcc2fa5f917b3076cf66caade1bdd5d-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398224,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvQ3,1424896219,WordPress: We Haven't Given Up on Bitcoin,"WordPress co-founding developer Matt Mullenweg says his company hasn't given up on bitcoin, despite its disappearance from his platform's checkout page.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Mullenweg said the decision to axe bitcoin came as a result of resource constraints during WordPress' push to streamline its five-year-old payments system – not a change of heart.  ""It is simply a matter of development resources, which are especially scarce for us right now as we're trying to keep up with growth,"" he said, adding that his team are still ""big fans"" of the digital currency.  It remains unclear exactly when bitcoin functionality will return, but WordPress users who wish to extend their yearly subscription before the phase-out can do so free of charge.  The idea was first floated in the CoinDesk comments section yesterday, with Mullenweg telling one user: ""Happy to extend your subscription an extra year for free, which should be plenty of time for us to finish redoing our store.""  Low transaction volume  The playoff between spending big and growing business organically has been a hot topic for WordPress. An ambitious push to improve the platform's mobile experience following the success of sites like Medium, alongside its continued search for future money-spinners, means resources are often stretched thin.  Unlike PayPal or credit cards, bitcoin is a low priority for the company, as it accounts for a handful of premium upgrades, which make up 80% of the billion-dollar company's revenue.  ""The volume has been dropping since launch, in 2014 it was only used about twice a week, which is vanishingly small compared to other methods of payment we offer.""  However, the self-described ""bitcoin believer"" stressed that the site's support for digital currency had always been more of a philosophical than commercial decision.  Indeed, the company's original 2012 blog post touted bitcoin as a way for WordPress to cater for users excluded by PayPal's restrictions on some countries (those on the US economic sanctions list, for example).  For Mullenweg, this enthusiasm for an alternative, borderless financial tool hasn't faded in the three years since.  ""I ... personally hold bitcoin, I'm an advisor to Stellar.org, and my friends make fun of me for bringing up bitcoin and the blockchain in unrelated conversations,"" he said.  But with bitcoin gone, does the developer worry that those in PayPal-restricted countries will now be excluded from the platform?  ""Of course, but either that number of people turned out to be smaller than we expected or they found other ways to pay,"" Mullenweg said, adding, ""I'm happy to extend people's subscription for a year, as I offered in your comments section"".  Bitcoin options available  In a recent conversation with Forbes, Mullenweg described WordPress' parent company Automattic, of which he is CEO and founder, as a ""big experiment"" into whether a fully open-source company can scale into a Google- or Facebook-sized business.  The parallels with bitcoin, an open-source technology with what some term to be Internet-sized potential, are clear.  For now, the bitcoin option is still available in several spots on the site, the 'WP Admin' page for example. Mullenweg said this was due to pages on the old code base, which will be available for a ""short while"" if bitcoin users want to renew their subscription before the phase out.  But what does Mullenweg think about the digital currency's long-term prospects?  ""I think transaction costs should follow Moore's law, and I don't think we're going to get there with the centralized gateways that currently account for the overwhelming majority of transactions,"" he said.  He added:  ""I believe bitcoin or some other blockchain-like system will be the basis of the majority of financial transactions in the future, from small remittances to multi-billion dollar corporate acquisitions.""

The One Bank Research Agenda investigates issues beyond the UK central bank's traditional scope to decipher how monetary policy interacts with developments such as climate change and increasing life spans.  Mark Carney, the Bank’s Governor, summarised today's launch of the Agenda saying:  ""Economies are complex, dynamic and constantly evolving systems that are underpinned by social interactions and behavioural change, shaped by fundamental forces like technology and globalisation and supported – or at times disrupted – by finance.""  The views offered on bitcoin in the agenda mark a stark contrast to the Bank of England's previous dismissal of bitcoin's ability to function on a wider scale.  The bitcoin agenda  The report noted that ""while existing private digital currencies have economic flaws which make them volatile, the distributed ledger technology that their payment systems rely on may have considerable promise"".  With this in mind, the Bank of England raised the question of whether central banks should make use of such technology to issue digital currencies. In doing so, the financial authority also addressed the economic, technological and regulatory challenges it would face if it did so.  The report outlined the costs and benefits of creating a new form of central bank money and making it widely accessible. The research also looked into how this development may impact existing payment and settlement systems, while analysing the implications for government-backed deposit insurance if central bank money was made widely accessible to both households and businesses.  The report questioned whether digital currencies issued by the central bank should be remunerated and whether this should be linked to the country's official interest rate.  Other aspects of the research included the implications for the availability of credit, the costs and benefits of different central banks using a common platform for issuing digital currencies, and how could institutions offering access to central bank issued digital currencies be regulated.  Social media response  The release of the agenda generated a significant amount of debate on Twitter, after George Osborne, the Chancellor, commented on the release, speaking about the positive ramifications for the Fintech industry.

42398239,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSveo,1424887217,Traditional Remittance Provider Adds Bitcoin Services in Latin America,"A bitcoin exchange and a remittance company have partnered to offer customers fiat-to-bitcoin deposit services across Latin America.  Bitex.la  has joined with More Money Transfershttp://www.moremt.com/portal/hgxpp001.aspx?81 (MMT), a Latin American remittances company in what they claim is the first alliance of its kind. However, the partnership, said Bitex chief marketing officer Manu Beaudroit, isn’t meant to provide remittance services in bitcoin, but instead, enable more people into contact and activity with the digital currency.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Beaudroit voiced his belief that bitcoin holds some of the greatest promise for remittance companies in the Latin American region.  “Remittance companies, which belong to the traditional ecosystem, are being threatened by bitcoin,” Beaudroit said. “With this alliance they are embracing the future of how money is going to be transmitted.”  The service is available in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Cochabamba, Bolivia, at present. Its network will soon extend to more than 240 Latin American cities.  Using More Money Transfers  Users need to first be registered with Bitex.la to receive a personal code required to make deposits into their accounts.  They can then go to any of MMT office and deposit fiat into their Bitex.la accounts. The deposit will be reflected in the user’s Bitex.la account in USD within one hour, with which it can buy bitcoin through Bitex.la.  Alternatively, users can go through the same process and receive funds directly in bitcoin. If they arrive at a MMT location with a ConectaBitcoin code, MMT will convert the deposited amount into USD, send it to users’ Bitex.la accounts, and Bitex.la will convert the funds into BTC.  Beaudroit said that the cash out feature will become more available through MMT by summer.  Latin American region  Latin America has been touted as a major region in which bitcoin can transform the way remittance services companies operate.  In a nod to the many citizens that either have no access to a bank account or endure the high cost of transmitting money abroad through money transfer services like Western Union and MoneyGram, Beaudroit expressed his excitement about a bitcoin company joining with a remittance service at last.  “For Latin America [this] is huge because it means that there’s no need for a bank to operate with bitcoin,” he said.  He added that this would make sending and receiving money a more accessible event for users because of the many locations available for them to do so across the region. While there are three MMT offices currently, the company has many more partnerships continent-wide with small businesses wherein users can access the service.

The new service, which comes about via a partnership with local bitcoin payment processor InPay S.A., is being rolled out as a three-month trial that aims to see how popular bitcoin payments will be with prepaid telephone users.  A spokesperson from T-Mobile Poland told CoinDesk:  ""Our team is constantly looking for new opportunities, partnerships and cooperations with startups bringing great ideas. One of the reasons behind this initiative was to test how quick and comfortable the top-up process could be. Simplifying it to four taps while keeping high security standards is a significant achievement.""  Lech Wilczyński, CEO and co-founder of InPay, said that the process was designed with smartphone users in mind, adding that ""bitcoin wallets respond to intentions and that really helps when you want to pay on a website while surfing the web on a mobile browser.""  How the service works  To purchase their desired amount of top-up code, T-Mobile customers must visit InPay's dedicated web page and add bitcoin funds by first selecting the equivalent amount in Polish zloties (PLN), then sending funds via the QR code or bitcoin address provided.  The process takes around 30 seconds and does not require the input of personal information or ""tedious copying code"", Wilczyński said.  The mobile network provider also confirmed that the majority of top-ups were sold by T-Mobile Poland's partners and agents, and added that this approach ""would help avoid amendments in T-Mobile's internal processes to include bitcoin accounting"".  Customers who use the bitcoin top-up service will also be rewarded with an extra 20% of calling credit during the trial.  Wilczyński said that this was only the beginning, and if the initiative proved successful, bitcoin customers could expect ""deeper integration"".

42398228,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvS1,1424872811,Cyberinsurance Veteran Teams With BitGo on ‘Watershed’ Insurance Policy,"Bitcoin security specialist BitGo has announced a new partnership with Innovation Insurance Group and XL Group that will enable it to offer $250,000 in theft insurance to customers who opt in to the program.  The coverage will protect BitGo's web wallet and platform API clients from errors resulting from its technology, processes or employee actions, as well as external hacking incidents and employee theft. Those who want to increase the value of their protection can also do so for a 1% annual fee.  Long associated with some of the more prominent evangelists behind multi-signature security, BitGo CEO Will O’Brien indicated that, for his team, the policy will help answer an outstanding customer concern, namely, what happens if the firm's own technology is compromised?  O’Brien told CoinDesk:  “The last piece is what happens if that service provider, even if they’re holding only one key, is compromised. We see it in our enterprise customers that are building sizable bitcoin businesses, those that have auditors or fund administrators. We see that those types of customers are saying, ‘How can I get an extra guarantee from BitGo?’”  Insurance veteran  Perhaps most interesting for the industry at large is the involvement of Innovation Insurance Group CEO Ty Sagalow in the deal.  A 30-year veteran of the insurance industry and 25-year veteran of AIG eBusiness Risk Solutions, Sagalow is credited with developing foundational tech insurance policies, such as cyberinsurance and reputation insurance, as well as other innovative offerings like Y2K insurance.  Sagalow indicated it didn’t take him long to see a similarity between the now-nascent bitcoin industry and the tech sector in 1999, and that he believes that his partnership with BitGo will represent a similarly historic moment.  “I think this is a watershed event, not just for the bitcoin industry, but the insurance industry. A number of carriers are going to have to reevaluate the bitcoin community,” Sagalow said.  O’Brien went on to clarify that the offering does not mean BitGo is reselling insurance, but rather its policy is just another way the company is limiting the liability of its customers, bolstering its claims through backing by an outside party.  “BitGo is insured and our customers are getting this comprehensive and scalable service through BitGo,” O’Brien said.  Limited early offerings  O’Brien further sought to differentiate his company’s insurance from others in the bitcoin space that he criticized as being less comprehensive and more for publicity purposes.  “If you look back at the history of insurance in bitcoin, a lot of this has been a marketing stunt,” he said. “Insurance that is protecting against crime, specifically the on-site theft of private keys by employees, it’s such a narrow definition of insurance. It’s more than likely never going to be the incident that causes the breach, theft or loss.”  The CEO went on to suggest that while such policies were appropriate for “bitcoin’s formative years”, his company’s offering would better meet the industry’s needs.  Sagalow added that the policy includes both new and customized elements of past insurance policies, including some parts of technology professional liability insurance, which protects against programming errors, and business interruption insurance.  “Whether you’re stealing a private key or social security number, you’re still stealing an electronic file. Bitcoin theft is fundamentally a cyber risk – there are elements of crime, there are elements of professional liability – so it’s a series of types of coverages put together in a new format and applied to a whole new industry,” Sagalow explained.  Bitcoin's image problem  Though optimistic that the partnership will send a wider message, Sagalow attested to the ongoing challenges bitcoin is facing in the insurance industry.  For example, Sagalow explained that to many insurance professionals, bitcoin is still synonymous with online black markets such as Silk Road.  “When I started talking to underwriters and carriers, a number of them said ‘Isn’t that the industry that’s involved in drugs and murder for hire, is that the industry you want us to start insuring?’” he said.  Still, Sagalow indicated that he believes “the greatest risk is not taking one”, a factor that lead him to embrace the challenge of insuring a company in the industry on behalf of XL Group.  He further applauded the bitcoin industry for the steps it has taken to distance itself from such illicit activities, comparing it favorably to the gambling industry in Nevada.  “I think of the casino industry,” he continued. “In the 1950s and 1960s, the Nevada casinos were owned by the mob, but that wasn't a permanent situation, eventually companies took over that industry. That happened in bitcoin, not in decades, but in a matter of months.”  Slow beginnings  Less quick was the time it took BitGo to obtain a partnership in the insurance space, as O’Brien indicated BitGo has been speaking to underwriters and industry analysts about the prospect since late 2013.  O’Brien painted this as a necessity, especially as more financial professionals enter the bitcoin space. “They are more expecting of guarantees and sophistication around these platforms. It’s not good enough just to have good code, and that we saw from a demand side and from a supply side,” he added.  Sagalow also admitted to a steep learning curve but also to “drinking the lemonade” of the bitcoin industry during his research, even starting a new venture, Bitcoin Insurance Agency, that will seek to support more bitcoin businesses.  Still, Sagalow cautioned that this won’t mean that every bitcoin company is insurable, adding that BitGo was a “logical first entry” given its security focus. However, he did express optimism that the partnership will at least create a conversation, and potentially, an opportunity akin to those that have proved successful in past tech fields.  Sagalow concluded:  “We’re hoping that this is just the beginning of a new version of cyberinsurance.”  Insurance image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/25/cyberinsurance-veteran-teams-with-bitgo-on-watershed-insurance-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b021a8d2f1b6d6e72189d737bf53f8b1780122e1-2560x1700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398223,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSvN6,1424863906,Defendant in Tasmania's 'Biggest Drugs Bust' Paid with Bitcoin,"A southern Tasmanian man has pleaded guilty to trafficking a controlled substance, following what the police have called the biggest drugs bust in the state's history.      Nicholas Mark Stebbins trafficked drugs including amphetamines, MDMA and cocaine with an estimated street value of $11m between August 2012 and July 2014 – and paid for them with bitcoin.    Hobart's Supreme Court  heard that Stebbins helped arrange and pay for seven parcels filled with drugs to be posted to Tasmania from overseas.  Crown prosecutor Darryl Coates said that the parcels, which were intercepted in Tasmania, Western Australia and Victoria, collectively contained more than 2kg of amphetamine and about $500,000-worth of MDMA.  Defence lawyers told the court that while Stebbins was part of a group that imported drugs, he was ""certainly not the head"" of the operation.  Stebbins is currently in custody and is awaiting sentencing next month.  The bust was part of a bigger police operation involving Tasmania Police, the Australian Federal Police and Australian Custom officers.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/25/defendant-in-tasmanias-biggest-drugs-bust-paid-with-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
