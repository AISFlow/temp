One that could very well see it beat the coveted $45,000 resistance point. This price level remains the level to beat for the digital asset as this is where bears continue to mount the most resistance. Bitcoin had tested this level in the early hours of Friday but like always, met significant push that caused it to crash back down below it. In the wake of this crash, the market saw bitcoin lose almost $1,000 in the space of two hours. However, this dip would be defined by a higher low as bitcoin had been able to find support above $44,000 and continue on its recovery. This demonstration at $45,000 shows that until the digital asset can successfully beat and settle above this level, it can never truly be said to have begun another bull run. Related Reading | Quant Explains How Stablecoin Ratio Can Give Bitcoin Buy Or Sell Signals The market is now turning favorable for buyers although sellers still maintain a majority hold on the market. If bitcoin is to beat $45,000 and register on another bull run, then buyers would have to turn up their support. Otherwise, bitcoin will continue to fail in its quest to beat this level.

Coinbase has been sending notices to its customers in those countries that the changes will take effect in early April in order to comply with local regulations.  ""We adhere to the laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate,"" a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk via email, adding:  ""While we will always advocate for what we think the laws should be, we must respect the laws that exist if we want to offer the suite of Coinbase services to customers in that country. I also want to make it clear that these changes, as outlined in our FAQ, only apply to Canada, Singapore, and Japan, where the laws require us to collect additional information. We are not applying this globally to customers.""  The move does not seem to be going over well with Coinbase customers in those countries, who value the built-in pseudonymity of cryptocurrency transactions.  According to a FAQ provided by Coinbase, for Canadian users, sending more than CAD $1,000 ($798) in crypto to a financial entity or other crypto exchange will require the name and address of the recipient. This will take effect starting April 4, Coinbase said, citing Canada's FINTRAC rules as reasons for the change.  For users in Singapore, all crypto transfers from a Coinbase user's exchange wallet to an outside address will require the recipient's full name and country of residence. This will take effect on April 1, with Coinbase citing local Singaporean regulations.  And in Japan, all transfers of crypto assets to recipients outside of Japan must include the recipient's name, address and destination wallet, according to the English translation of rules established by the Japan Cryptocurrency Trading Association (JVCEA).

The energy impact of crypto – particularly, of energy-intensive proof-of-work crypto mining – has become a flashpoint in recent years as lawmakers around the globe have floated proposals to ban proof-of-work mining, citing environmental concerns.  Industry proponents have pushed back against those concerns, claiming that the data used for crypto energy usage projections – some of which claim proof-of-work mining uses more energy than some industrialized nations each year – is unreliable or irrelevant.  Crypto and blockchain technology has also been proffered as a potential solution to environmental challenges, including carbon accounting and reducing emissions from gas flaring.

42411817,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgD5V,1648240758,"The Story Behind QuadrigaCX and Gerald Cotten, Netflix’s ‘Crypto King’","Our story begins in December 2018 with Gerald Cotten, the founder of Canada’s largest crypto exchange at the time, QuadrigaCX. He and his new bride, Jennifer Robertson, go on a trip to India where Cotten, who suffered from Crohn’s disease, fell ill. Unfortunately, his health takes a turn for the worse and he passes away shortly after being admitted to a hospital. A month later, QuadrigaCX announces his passing in a statement credited to Robertson.  Here’s where the story gets strange: In the months leading to Cotten’s death, customers had been complaining they couldn’t get their money out of the exchange and were waiting weeks, if not months, to receive funds. One customer who spoke to CoinDesk at the time said, ""There's a bunch of warning bells going off in most people's heads right now.”  Rightfully so, as it turned out. On Jan. 28, the exchange went offline for ""maintenance."" Soon after, a court filing first obtained by CoinDesk revealed that QuadrigaCX owed customers $190 million (all dollar amounts throughout are U.S.) and what seemed to be the big kicker at the time: No one knew how to access the exchange’s reserves. His widow stated in court that while she had Cotten’s laptop, it was encrypted, she was never given the password or recovery key and Cotten was the only person with control of QuadrigaCX’s cold storage system.  In other words, access to somewhere around $190 million in cryptocurrency potentially vanished with Cotten’s death. Or so it seemed.  The story of QuadrigaCX  QuadrigaCX was started by Gerald Cotten and Michael Patryn in Canada in 2013, focusing on local trades of bitcoin (BTC). With a small staff, they expanded in 2014 to open a bitcoin ATM in Vancouver, but had trouble raising funds and ran out of money in 2015 after a failed attempt to go public and list on the Canadian Securities Exchange.  By 2016, plans to go public were abandoned, the legal counsel was let go and all of the other directors had resigned from QuadrigraCX, creating a one-man show with Cotten alone running the business.  According to reports, Cotten ran the company from his laptop, from no permanent office. But the company grew despite its rocky start as the price of bitcoin surged in 2017 from $1,000 to nearly $20,000. People wanted a way to get in on the action, and the company grew to 350,000 customers trading over a billion dollars in assets. But that price surge wasn’t to last. When bitcoin crashed in 2018, customers wanted to cash out what they could, and that’s where the trouble really began.  Who was Gerald Cotten?  To understand how so many people trusted a company that was a one-man show with their money, it is important to know who that man was.  Gerald Cotten was an early cryptocurrency evangelist and part of a Vancouver group in 2013 that referred to itself as the Vancouver Bitcoin Co-op. On the surface, he seemed like a “nice Canadian guy” who was an expert on cryptocurrency and believed in the power of bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, to be a transformational technology for finance. According to a lengthy Vanity Fair piece, Cotten “always seemed to be smiling. It was a gentle, unflappable smile. It put strangers at ease; it made him seem lighthearted.”  Unlike other CEOs such as Binance’s Changpeng Zhao, Cotten did not seek the spotlight and was not known as a public figure. However, QuadrigaCX was often a sponsor of local crypto educational events and charities such as the Indian orphanage that he said was the reason for his December 2018 visit.  At the time QuadrigaCX’s business skyrocketed it was still difficult for most people to invest in cryptocurrency, and the company had the advantage of being one of the first to market. Cotten’s evangelism and knowledge of bitcoin was clear, and some of the company’s success can be attributed to his early efforts to appear to care more about helping people understand and see the potential of Bitcoin than turning a profit.  But as these stories go, things weren’t as simple as they appeared. Cotten’s death brought that all to the surface.  Unlocking the missing funds  According to the excellent podcast series on the story, ""Exit Scam,"" many people, including his widow, expected a ""Dead Man’s Switch"" to come after Cotten’s death. The switch is basically an email or other message, triggered in the event of unexpected death, revealing the private keys or where the private keys could be found. But there was no Dead Man’s Switch message coming. The lack of a plan for access to QuadrigaCX’s cold storage wallets seemed especially strange because it came to light that Cotten had changed his will in the month before he went to India.  Customers who had been waiting on funds that were locked in QuadrigaCX accounts immediately started to cry foul, with threads on Reddit and other forums questioning if Cotten was really even dead. (We’ll come back to that later.)  But here’s the thing about cryptocurrency – while many people think bitcoin is anonymous, it is very much not in very important ways. Blockchain technology relies on there being a public ledger of all transactions that can be verified and viewed by anyone, anywhere. To put it simply: You can’t necessarily tell from that ledger that a particular person (such as Cotten) transferred bitcoin to another person (such as Robertson). However, you can view that at a certain time and date this specific wallet address transferred this amount of bitcoin to this other wallet.  You can see how often and how much a wallet address has transacted on the blockchain, and what it's currently holding. On a blockchain explorer, it would look like this:  Address 1HyYMMCdCcHnfjwMW2jE4cv9qVkVDFUzVa  This address has transacted 1,616 times on the Bitcoin blockchain. It has received a total of 13,317.41449980 BTC ($597,943,920.59) and has sent a total of 13,281.03663698 BTC ($596,310,576.38). The current value of this address is 36.37786282 BTC ($1,633,344.21).  So even if no one could access the cryptocurrency within QuadrigaCX’s wallets in order to give money back to customers, the crypto would still exist there. In the coming months, six bitcoin wallets were identified as linked to QuadrigaCX. Shockingly, they were nearly empty.  Fraud and schemes come to light  After the revelation the cold storage wallets that were supposed to contain QuadrigaCX’s reserves contained a small fraction of the missing $190 million, accounting firm Ernst & Young followed with another bombshell report in June 2019. It detailed how Cotten transferred millions of dollars in crypto out of customer accounts and into other exchanges, which he then used to fund his lavish lifestyle and personal trading activities.  The trading activities were massive – the report detailed that between 2016 and 2018, Cotten transferred 9,450 bitcoin, 387,738 ether (ETH) and 239,020 litecoin (LTC) out of the exchange’s accounts. He had many fake accounts within QuadrigaCX, including one under the name Chris Markay, who was not only an alias but the single biggest user on the platform, QuadrigaCX’s “whale.” The massive deposits Markay seemed to be making on QuadrigaCX were just as fake as he was, and Cotten (as Markay) used these fake funds to buy very real bitcoin from other customers.  He lost $115 million under these aliases, according to a report from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) that detailed just where the money went. He also lost $28 million on external exchanges and spent approximately $24 million on real estate, vehicles, travel and other personal expenses. It was hard to nail down where all the money went; the Ernst & Young report revealed there was no accounting paperwork and generally very little documentation.  While exact figures may never be known, what was crystal clear at this point was that QuadrigaCX was a Ponzi scheme. The report begins:  ""The downfall of crypto asset trading platform QuadrigaCX (Quadriga) resulted from a fraud committed by Quadriga’s co-founder and CEO Gerald Cotten (Cotten). Clients entrusted their assets to Quadriga, which provided false assurances that those assets would be safeguarded. In reality, Cotten spent, traded and used those assets at will. Operating without any proper system of oversight or internal controls, Cotten was able to misuse client assets for years, unchecked and undetected, ultimately bringing down the entire platform.""  The next shoe to drop was the revelation that this wasn’t Cotten’s first rodeo. Reddit sleuths and investigative journalist Amy Castor found he had a long history of Ponzi schemes starting when he was just 15 years old.  Put that together with the knowledge that Cotten owned boats that could get to the Caribbean without refueling, knew how to fly planes, often traveled abroad with large amounts of cash and that QuadrigaCX’s wallets were not only empty when he died but some had been empty for some time, it’s not hard to reach the conclusion that Cotten was planning an exit scam.  Which leads to the biggest debate in the matter of Gerald Cotten: Did he fake his own death as part of an exit scam or did he actually die and set off a chain of events that exposed his scheme?  Is Cotten still alive?  From almost the moment the news came out that Cotten had died, long before the explosive report from Ernst & Young, theories started circulating online that Cotten was still alive and had faked his own death.  Despite the fact there is an official death certificate and an investigation by the Globe and Mail newspaper with quotes from the Indian hospital detailing the timeline of his death, some are unconvinced. There’s a typo in the death certificate. Cotten had cultivated skills from years of illicit activities in covering his tracks. He knew how to create fake identities and owned planes and a boat he could use to escape. There’s ample evidence pointing to the idea that Cotten was indeed planning an exit scam and that he was a con artist.  In the ""Exit Scam"" podcast, Aaron Lammer details ways people can even hire ""facilitators"" in India to fake a death, including getting a fake body to put in a coffin as part of the package. He also explains that at no point in the transport of Cotten’s body from India to its burial in Canada was anyone, at any point, required to identify the body.  Former QuadrigaCX investors have called for the authorities to exhume Cotten's body and conduct an autopsy to settle the question in the most final way possible.  Until then, the evidence at hand does leave room for debate. Putting together all we know, it looks most likely that while Cotten was planning to disappear, he died an untimely death in India in 2018.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Toby Leah Bochan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/the-story-behind-quadrigacx-and-gerald-cotten-netflixs-crypto-king,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36c08d81c5898441aed0b7020732d72950cbf32c-1180x907.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422858,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qU5h,1648240123,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Outperforms as Crypto Bulls Take a Breather,"Bitcoin (BTC) reached as high as $45,000 on Friday, although buyers lost momentum later in the New York trading day.  Most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) underperformed BTC on Friday, suggesting a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders heading into the weekend. Further, bitcoin's dominance ratio, or BTC's market cap relative to the total crypto market cap, ticked higher, reversing a short-term downtrend over the past few days.  Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why. Coming April 4.  It appears that crypto bulls are taking a breather, tracking price moves in equities. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes were mostly flat on Friday. From a technical perspective, bitcoin and stocks are approaching short-term resistance levels, which could stall the current relief rally over the next few days.  Still, pullbacks could be brief as some technical indicators point to further upside potential, especially in altcoins. For example, ether (ETH) broke above $3,000 this week and reversed its intermediate-term downtrend. That supports upside follow-through in the near term, according to Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies. ""We believe there is upside to resistance near $3,500 for ETH defined by the 200-day moving average,"" Stockton wrote in a Friday email.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $44,448, +1.12%    ●Ether (ETH): $3,116, +0.09%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,543, +0.51%    ●Gold: $1,955 per troy ounce, −0.35%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.49%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Time for a turnaround  Bitcoin is approaching a cycle low, according to some metrics.  The chart below from Delphi Digital shows prior instances when BTC's year-over-year return turned negative, which preceded major price troughs. A rally in altcoins could also confirm a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment, which typically signals the start of a relief rally.  Still, negative returns can persist for a few months, similar to what occurred in 2014 and 2018. Typically, bear market rallies benefit short-term traders until a decisive shift from a downtrend to an uptrend is confirmed.  ""Bitcoin has yet to break out of its trading range, but we have been seeing some strength in certain pockets of the crypto market, making for better trading setups than weeks prior,"" Delphi Digital wrote in a Friday blog post.  Key levels to watch  For now, bitcoin's technical support and resistance levels continue to align with positioning data seen on the blockchain.  The chart below shows price bands based on the cost basis of long-term and short-term bitcoin holders relative to the current market price. The average price paid for BTC by investors who purchased after the October price high is $45,900, which is seen as resistance, according to data compiled by Glassnode.  A breakout above technical resistance at $46,000-$50,000 could put short-term bitcoin holders in a profitable position. Failure to hold above that price range, however, could encourage traders to sell at a loss.  Altcoin roundup  Anchor Protocol to readjust interest rates: Anchor Protocol, the decentralized money market built on the Terra blockchain, will dynamically adjust interest rates each month following a community vote that passed on Thursday. With the new proposal, payout rates would increase by 1.5% if yield reserves increase and drop by 1.5% if yield reserves fall by 5%. Anchor's native token, ANC, dropped as much as 5% following the rate announcement. Read more here.  Trading volumes moderate: BTC and ETH trading volumes on Coinbase's exchange have been lackluster over the past few weeks. Altcoins, however, have outperformed with spikes in trading volume. ""Despite this volume spike, buy ratios for most coins have moderated and were mostly in the 50-60% range,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, wrote in a Friday newsletter. That means crypto buyers have less conviction on price rises, which could point to limited upside. Additionally, trading volumes of APE (a new listing on the Coinbase exchange) and the low-market cap JASMY token outpaced the most oft-traded coins such as ADA, SOL and AVAX, according to Duong.  AVAX $100-$127 upside target: From a technical perspective, Avalanche's AVAX token is holding price support above $60 and faces resistance at $100, which is the top of a three-month-long price range. A decisive breakout of the current price range could yield additional upside (roughly 40%) toward the high of $127.30 that was reached in December.

42420980,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAot3,1648237397,Bitcoin City: El Salvador’s Dreams for Utopia on Hold,"A place with zero taxes, powered geothermally by a volcano and funded by bitcoin bonds. That is what La Unión, a small city in the eastern part of El Salvador, will become if President Nayib Bukele's ambitious plan comes to fruition.  But nobody is holding their breath. After a buggy rollout of the Central American nation’s bitcoin wallet and delays to its “bitcoin bonds,” some are skeptical of the plans.  According to the outline presented by Bukele in November, Bitcoin City will include residential and commercial areas, restaurants, an airport as well as a port and rail service. With the city laid out in a circle (like a coin), the vision is for a crypto haven with no income, property or capital gains taxes.  Read more: US Senate to Consider Bill Examining El Salvador's Bitcoin Experiment  But La Unión locals have expressed mixed emotions about the plans. On one hand, they hope the investment will boost the economy. On the other, they are wary about whether Bukele will fulfill his promises.  Amilcar Alvarado is the manager of the La Unión outlet of Tienda Par2, a major shoe store franchise. He tells CoinDesk that most residents received the announcement of Bitcoin City positively.  “Here, in La Unión, there is little commerce. La Unión needs more places like Bitcoin City to help the economy grow and La Unión to change, as we see in San Salvador,” he said, referring to El Salvador’s capital city. “There should be many places to visit. In La Unión, we only have the bay and certain shops.”  According to Alvarado, La Unión could become an important city of El Salvador, but with the government making so many Bitcoin announcements recently, there’s a sense of uncertainty.  Anxel Miguel Flores Lainez, an agent in La Unión who helps people use the Chivo bitcoin wallet launched by the government last September, sees Bitcoin City as an opportunity for La Unión to receive foreign investments.  “We've been sidetracked for a long, long time. This has been a joy for the people of La Union. The port here is unused. There are things that have not yet been activated. And many think that La Unión will be able to grow,” he said.  Read more: El Salvador’s Bukele Shoots Down FUD on Bitcoin Bond, Takes Issue With US Lawmakers  Michael Peterson, who founded Bitcoin Beach, El Salvador’s first bitcoin oasis in the beach town of El Zonte, thinks the Bitcoin City plan was probably put together hastily.  “Bitcoin City was something that came together at the last minute. I think there's a good chance the government saw just how much interest there was in El Salvador and all these different businesses that were here looking to invest,” he told CoinDesk.  Still, he added, “I think it's actually something that could come to fruition, and could actually have a big impact on the world.”  What happens in La Unión is tied to the larger progress of El Salvador, which has grabbed international attention with its plans to become a center of bitcoin development.  A delayed bitcoin bond  El Salvador’s government has among its plans the issuance of a $1 billion bitcoin-backed bond. Of that amount, $500 million will be used to help construct needed energy and bitcoin mining infrastructure and the other $500 million to buy even more bitcoin, as Bukele announced in November during his presentation of Bitcoin City.  A tokenized financial instrument developed by Blockstream, the bond projects a 6.5% coupon, or the rate of annual interest payments, with a 10-year maturity on the Liquid Network. Investors will also receive dividends generated by staggered liquidation of bitcoin holdings, which will start in year six.  El Salvador Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya had projected that the bond would be launched between March 15 and March 20, but at the time of this publication, the issuance hadn’t taken place.  On March 11, Zelaya noted the war between Ukraine and Russia could slow the process. ""We have the tools almost finished, but the international context will tell us,"" he told a local TV station at that time.  Dollar is still king in El Salvador  La Unión is located in the Department of La Unión, which is in the far southeast end of El Salvador. (El Salvador is divided up into 14 departments.) The department has a population of 277,700 and a literacy rate of 72,2%. But in an indication that the plans for Bitcoin City remain up in the air, it isn’t clear the development will actually happen there.  Javier, a local tour guide, said Bitcoin City might end up near Conchagua, another nearby town with a port.  La Unión already knows about bitcoin: Fifty percent of the stores there accept it, according to Alvarado. “Shoe stores, clothing shops and other stores accept it. They have their acceptance sign, just like we do. Pretty much everybody is on board with bitcoin. And that suggests that this is going to work,” he said.  The data, however, points to another reality. According to El Salvador’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 86% of local businesses haven’t made any sales using bitcoin, and only 13.9% said that they had. Meanwhile, 3.6% of local stores said that bitcoin has contributed to an increase in their sales, while 91.7% reported that the implementation of bitcoin has had no effect on their businesses.  Cecilia Salazar, a manager of the store Italia in La Unión, said about 10 to 15 customers use bitcoin to pay daily, most of them locals. The store has been accepting bitcoin since it became legal tender in El Salvador in September.  Read more: Behind the Scenes of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Bond With the Man Who Designed It  The government released videos explaining how to use bitcoin and spurred use of its Chivo Wallet by airdropping $30 in bitcoin to adults.  Bitcoin’s price volatility is a drawback. “You have one amount of bitcoin, then another. But that is because of the conversion of the cryptocurrency,” Alvarado said.  Flores Lainez, a Chivo adviser in La Unión, says much of the population is still coming to terms with it all.  “First of all, they don't understand what satoshis are, what the currency itself is. Most of La Union’s population didn't have any kind of information about bitcoin,” Flores Lainez said. El Salvador isn't known as a country with a high technological penetration, he noted.  According to the World Bank, about 50% of the population of 6.5 million had internet access as of 2019.  “The elderly don't know how to use bitcoin. They have had several problems in that sense,” said Flores Lainez, who added that most of the population who use Chivo Wallet are adults between 20 and 45 years old.

With just a few days having passed since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government announced an appeal for contributions in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, and USDT to aid in the support of its soldiers and citizens who had been displaced by the invasion.

Bitcoin Futures Open Interest Adds More Than $1.5 Billion Within A Few Hours As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC open interest has shot up over the past day as the coin&apos;s price has observed a surge. The &apos;open interest&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin futures contracts currently open on all derivatives exchanges. When the value of this metric is rising, it means more futures positions are opening up on exchanges. This leads to higher leverage in the market, and can result in more volatility. On the other hand, the open interest&apos;s value going down suggests investors are closing up their positions as they pull out of the market. As leverage lowers during this trend, it can lead to lesser volatility in the price of Bitcoin. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin open interest over the past month: Looks like the value of the indicator has surged up over the past day | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the BTC open interest observed a sharp rise within the last 24 hours as the coin&apos;s price enjoyed an uptrend.

There, I encountered all sorts of random items: trading tips, motor vehicles for sale, statements about the oil pipeline protests at Standing Rock, the occasional conspiracy theory and a message that read, “In loving memory of Georges Fraipoints (16/01/1946-19/02/2017). Awesome man, father and friend. We will miss you.”  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But it is one from October 2016 that struck me most: “Need 30 btc. Please! Dream to leave Syria…Help get out of Syria. I live in Aleppo. I am 14 years old. I do not cheat. Community help!!!!!!!”  Did this young person ever get the donation? (At that time, 30 BTC would have been about $18,000.) Did he or she ever get out of Aleppo? Did they survive?  I knew I’d never get answers to those questions or find out whether the message was a legitimate call for help or some sort of con. But that didn’t stop me from being struck by the pathos of what I’d read. In the midst of a brutal war, Bitcoin’s immutable ledger had offered someone a means of asserting their humanity, a small but crucial act of defiance against an authoritarian regime hell-bent on denying it.  When you strip everything back from the mania around crypto and the new business models being built on it, its core, most important, idea is that of immutability. A truly decentralized, permissionless blockchain is perhaps the only unbreakable record of history we’ve ever had. At a time when authoritarianism is on the rise, that’s an incredibly powerful concept.  Effectively using blockchain technology as a bulwark against authoritarianism will require the complex integration of many moving parts, including changes in the legal process and the practice of journalism. But a framework for how it might be helpful – in concert with other tools of cryptography – is starting to take shape, partly because of the work being done at the Starling Lab, part of Stanford’s Center for Blockchain Research.  Lower down in the column, we’ll delve into the Starling Lab’s bid to improve how we authenticate and store information to bolster trust in news sources and evidential information, drawing on this week’s episode of the “Money Reimagined” podcast, in which our guest was the Starling Lab’s Jonathan Dotan.  Dotan makes clear that this is a challenging task. But God knows it’s one we must undertake.  Lies as legitimacy  All authoritarian regimes tend to assert their own, inevitably distorted version of history as part of their strategy for maintaining power. Without the legitimacy of a mandate founded on a free and fair election, they will strive to install some other legitimizing story in the public consciousness.  Think of Pol Pot’s Orwellian decree restarting Cambodian history at what he called “Year Zero.” These myth creation processes often manifest as historical appropriation, as when Hugo Chavez recast Simon Bolivar as a socialist, even though the 19th-century Venezuelan independence hero died two decades before a young Karl Marx wrote “The Communist Manifesto.” And, to be sure, they often fail, which, for now at least, seems to be the fate of former President Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” movement. (Have @ me, Trump supporters. That was an attempt at an authoritarian flex if ever there was one.)  Right now, we face a front-and-center example of immediate importance. Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to shore up support at home for his country's invasion of Ukraine by perpetuating the myth that Ukraine is occupied by Nazis and that Russia’s soldiers are liberating a neighboring country in the same way that a World War II generation fought back Hitler’s armies on the eastern front. Meanwhile, with the shuttering of independent media outlets, the Kremlin is covering up both the atrocities committed by his military and its own massive loss of Russian soldiers’ lives.  That this is occurring in an age of deep fakes, of bot-driven misinformation campaigns and of cynically crafted psyop strategies designed to steer our dopamine-triggered minds into amplifying false information makes the issue all the more urgent.  At the dawn of the social media age, Silicon Valley leaders would tout Facebook and Twitter as tools to democratize information and power. No longer. Nefarious uses of social media have generated what social scientists call the “liar’s dividend.” They foster broad-based mistrust in information generally, including in what might otherwise be seen as incontrovertible evidence that something is untrue.  Decentralized trust  To address these massive challenges, we need to re-architect the internet, says Dotan. And while blockchain technology is no panacea – as critics frequently point out, you can immutably store a lie in a blockchain – its principles of information permanence offer a framework for changing how we engage with online information.  When combined with encryption, decentralized storage and zero-knowledge proofs, along with a new mindset for how we verify and weigh cryptographically signed and stored information, the Starling Lab’s approach offers a path to improving how we collectively ascertain facts and decide what’s true and what’s not.  The lab is working with journalists, lawyers and historians to develop standards on how best to use these tools to create new systems of archiving and evidence gathering. The goal is to foster “decentralized trust” so as to “lower information uncertainty,” Dotan says.  “The technology around cryptography gives us a chance to do two things: One, it allows us to find ways to authenticate information – since I know at the source exactly what happened, I can freeze that moment, lock it in,” he says. “And the second thing I can do is I can encrypt, which means I can choose what I want to disclose and to who and when.”  Citing Russian misinformation bots’ cynical use of “#SyriaHoax” tweets to sow doubt in the minds of the public before evidence of chemical weapons attacks were revealed in the Syrian war, Dotan said it’s critical we now use these techniques to record evidence of Russia’s war crimes in the Ukraine invasion. That way, when the world finally gets around to delivering justice, it will have a safeguarded, provable record of what happened.  It’s the early days at the Starling Lab, but some of the team’s undertakings demonstrate the potential significance of its work. Using Filecoin’s decentralized storage protocol, for example, it has created an archive of the photos covering 78 days of the presidential transition in 2020, including the Jan. 6 riots. The team has also recorded the testimonies of Holocaust survivors in the same manner.  The Holocaust case seems especially pertinent. If humanity is to live up to the “never again” commitment that was expressed at the end of World War II, we cannot allow future generations to forget or misrepresent the truth of what happened there. There is no more important use case for cryptography and blockchain technology.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

Lawmakers at the Economic Affairs Committee are also poised to include crypto transfers to self-hosted or private wallets (also referred to as unhosted wallets) in anti-money laundering (AML) checks, and want to halt crypto transfers between the EU and jurisdictions like Turkey and Hong Kong.  Under existing laws, payees need to be identified for any bank transfer over EUR 1,000 ($1,099). The bloc’s national governments have already said they want to scrap that lower limit when extending the rules to crypto assets – on the basis that large transactions could just be broken up into smaller ones, a practice known as ""smurfing.""

Even the right-wing lawmakers who oppose the move to de-anonymize transactions appear to acknowledge they won’t win the vote.  Internal parliament documents seen by CoinDesk, dated March 25 suggest lawmakers will also tell crypto service providers to refrain from making or aiding any transfers deemed at high risk of money laundering or crime.  That will in practice make it harder, or perhaps impossible, to make transfers from the EU to anywhere deemed by the bloc as a tax haven, such as the U.S. and U.K. Virgin Islands, Turkey, Russia or Hong Kong, or places like Iran and the Cayman Islands seen as dirty-money hotspots.  Assita Kanko, one of the lead lawmakers responsible for marshalling the parliament’s views on the law, also said Tuesday she wants to extend the measures to include privately held crypto assets, in spite of uncertainty over how transactions between unhosted wallets could be enforced.

42394274,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvapeT,1648232472,4 Reasons Why Bitcoiners Should Pass on El Salvador's Bitcoin Bond,"For crypto enthusiasts, El Salvador’s bitcoin-backed ""volcano"" bond is extremely exciting. Tokenizing a billion dollar sovereign bond on the blockchain would be a first. So would sidestepping traditional financial institutions to issue debt by using a crypto exchange and taking half the proceeds to buy bitcoin (BTC) and using the rest to fund infrastructure and bitcoin mining powered by geothermal energy. Unfortunately for bitcoiners, the bond has major red flags.  Frank Muci is a fellow at LSE’s School of Public Policy. His research interests include economic growth policy and public financial management.  For context, El Salvador’s government postponed the sale set for last week citing market conditions related to Ukraine and the price of bitcoin. But the country’s finance minister explained that the issuance is ready and President Nayib Bukele tweeted March 23 that the sale will happen once a local pension reform is approved.  So what are the concerns?  1. Unsuitable issuer  Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya confirmed that a small state-owned energy company, LaGeo, will issue the bond, not the Republic of El Salvador. This may sound like a trivial distinction, but it is not.  With a 6.5% coupon, the billion-dollar bond will generate $65 million in annual interest expenses, but according to LaGeo’s financial statements, the company only booked $136 million in revenue last year and $36 million in profits. As a result, the added interest payments will make the company very unprofitable. Plus, LaGeo already has $205 million in long-term debt, so the bond would sextuple its leverage. This last-minute change makes little economic sense.  Finance Minister Zelaya recently implied that LaGeo’s bond would be backed by the full faith and credit of El Salvador, but a sovereign guarantee is not real until it is codified in a legally binding debt contract, which raises the next concern.  2. Limited information and legal protections  El Salvador’s government has not circulated a prospectus for the bitcoin bond. Those are usually 100-plus page legal documents that disclose financial information, warn of risk factors and indicate terms and conditions. In fact, authorities have not even published a whitepaper or website with the formula for the bitcoin dividend, plans to safeguard the $500 million bitcoin purchase or for that matter, any other basic facts. At this point, potential buyers are running on information from photographs of an outdated PowerPoint slide describing the bond from last November.  In addition, it appears the bond is set to be governed by local law in El Salvador, not by New York law like all of the country’s other bonds. If so, that means that any future disputes must be resolved in El Salvador’s court system, which has a weaker rule of law than the United States. Just last May, El Salvador’s congress voted to dismiss five judges from the Supreme Court and hastily replaced them in less than two months.  In any case, the new legal framework that is meant to govern the new tokenized bond has not been presented to El Salvador’s Congress or approved, so potential buyers don’t know what kinds of laws will govern the instrument.  None of this matters if El Salvador’s government is willing and able to repay the debt until it matures in 2032. But a lot can happen in ten years, so if either willingness to pay or ability to pay changes over the next decade, investors will be stuck holding a bond with questionable legal status in a jurisdiction that may not treat them fairly. This is very relevant given the next point.  3. Unsustainable finances  El Salvador’s long-term bonds are currently trading for just a tad over 50 cents on the dollar because traditional financial markets expect that the country will stop repaying its debt soon, perhaps as early as next January when a large $800 million bond is due. Typically, countries in financial distress try to stave off economic crises by taking often drastic steps to regain fiscal sustainability, usually through some combination of spending cuts, tax increases and other structural reforms.  However, this does not appear to be the current plan in El Salvador, which raises the prospect of insolvency and a debt crisis. If El Salvador is widely expected to stop repaying debts in the next two to three years, it does not make sense for the country to issue yet more debt unless its government has charted a clear path to financial sustainability. That doesn’t seem to be the case right now.  4. Links with Bitfinex/Tether  In addition, the bond will be issued on Bitfinex, a crypto exchange that is banned in the United States and has been repeatedly fined by regulators. Bitfinex and its holding company iFinex have close ties to the Tether stablecoin through common shareholders and management. Tether also has a long record of run-ins with regulators, especially because of the opacity surrounding the U.S. dollar reserves backing its tokens.  Given these facts, it seems that partnering with another major crypto exchange, such as FTX or Coinbase, and using another stablecoin like USDC would broaden the universe of potential investors to include Americans and ease investor concerns about the questionable track record of bond’s sponsors.  Success breeds success  For crypto to compete with traditional finance and break into the sovereign bond market, the first debt issuance by a nation-state on the blockchain needs to succeed. If the volcano bond fails, it will be ridiculed and make it difficult, if not impossible, for other countries to attempt something similar.  But what we’ve seen in El Salvador is one red flag after another. A last-minute change of the issuer from the national government to a small, little-known energy company. A worrying lack of legal documentation and basic information. No plans to curb the budget deficit and avoid a likely sovereign debt default. And partnerships with eyebrow-raising organizations. That’s why the bitcoin community should pass on the volcano bond until a better opportunity comes around.

42407276,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVUNDR,1648232207,Greener Bitcoin Mining Could Be China’s ‘Trillion-Dollar Present’ to the US,"This is the second part of a two-part series. Read the first story here.  When China banned bitcoin (BTC) mining from May of last year, it handed the U.S. a “trillion-dollar present,” as one mining executive told CoinDesk. But perhaps most importantly, crypto miners, particularly listed firms in the U.S., Canada and parts of Europe, are presiding over a shift towards greener and more innovative ways to use energy for mining coins.  Adding to a higher mix of renewables, crypto miners are becoming more adept at balancing the load of demand at power grids, while energy giants like Exxon are now exploring new paradigms, such as piloting the use of wasted gas from its North Dakota oil wells to power bitcoin mining operations, for example.  While this transformation is moving rapidly, it can’t come fast enough for the now-adolescent Bitcoin mining industry, whose ingrained dirty image continues to attract the attention of lawmakers and the public.  Environmental, social and governance (ESG) pressures on crypto mining’s energy use are mounting, both from within U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration and also from the European Union with its recent deliberation on a possible ban of proof-of-work (PoW) mining. An adjacent concern comes in the form of proposed rules that would give the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) insight into carbon footprints of listed firms.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Mining Week.  The “greener mining” saga goes back a decade, when North America constituted a mere sliver of bitcoin’s global hashrate.  For those cryptocurrency frontiersmen, an obvious step towards improving the sustainable power mix was simply locating mining operations in places where an excess of renewable energy was on offer. That could be parts of Canada where there’s a lot of hydropower and, more recently, places like Texas with its surfeit of wind and solar.  Proximity matters  In such places, renewable energy production has to be curtailed at times because there’s too much congestion on power lines transmitting that energy to urban centers. So there’s a need for local load brought by bitcoin miners, who act as a kind of safety valve for stranded power that would otherwise go to waste.  “Proximity matters,” said Peter Wall, CEO at listed mining firm Argo Blockchain (ARBK), which was set up initially in Quebec, tapping into the region’s hydropower, and now also located in West Texas. “When you are close to renewables, you have better access to them. That’s just a reality.”  Read more: Mining Industry Not That Worried by SEC’s Proposed New Climate Reporting Rules  In addition to providing renewable power, the grid in Texas, run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), incentivizes a high capacity power user like Argo to quickly shut down at times when the utility requires a lot of power; for example, to heat people’s homes in the winter or cool them in the summer.  Financially incentivizing bitcoin miners’ flexible load capabilities adds a virtuous competitive element into the Texas grid, Wall explained.  “If you opt in every day to be a flexible load provider, i.e., to be on call to be shut down, the Texas grid will give you a discount on your power and will pay you back to be essentially a virtual power plant,” Wall told CoinDesk. “To have the option to shut you down instead of having to fire up some other type of generation is economically advantageous for the miner. But more importantly, it’s economically advantageous for the grid because it keeps the cost of power lower for everyone.”  Core values  Core Scientific (CORZ), another U.S. crypto mining giant, produces monthly reports detailing the amount of energy handed back to the grid in times of need.  “We have arrangements with the communities and utilities wherein; when the grid needs it, we will down power,” said Core Scientific CEO Mike Levitt in an interview. “If we get a call from one of the utility companies in the geographies where we operate who need 30 megawatts available from two to five o’clock today, we put the machines into sleep mode, and it’s literally a keystroke because we have a software program that manages the 160,000-plus mining rigs.”  Last month, for example, Core powered down in two different states, for a total of 4,400 megawatt hours.  “Our industry really can quite legitimately, effectively and uniquely release energy utilization to the grid; it’s almost as if we’re acting as a battery,” Levitt said. What’s often not recognized, he added, is that utility companies would normally have to rely on so-called peaker power plants in times of high demand. “Generally speaking, those peaker facilities are the old ones and the dirty ones and the expensive ones,” Levitt said.  Read more: Don’t Call It a Comeback: The Unlikely Rise of Home Bitcoin Mining  There’s a tacit understanding that when China controlled the lion’s share of bitcoin mining such transparent arrangements simply didn’t exist. It needed publicly accountable companies operating on U.S. regulated soil to make that happen.  “China’s ban that resulted in the down-powering of mining infrastructure was a trillion-dollar present to the U.S.,” said Core Scientific co-founder Darin Feinstein. “I am certain that the people in China will question the wisdom of banning one of the largest innovations in financial, economic and accounting history.”  Rapid turnaround  Nasdaq-listed mining company Marathon (MARA) echoed Core Scientific’s sentiment regarding China, and pointed to the rapid shift in bitcoin mining’s renewable power mix over the past year.  “One of the reasons that so much of the mining industry moved into North America when China banned bitcoin mining is that people woke up to the fact that we have a lot of excess power in the United States,” said Marathon Vice President of Corporate Communications Charlie Schumacher in an interview.  Bitcoin mining went from 37% sustainably powered to 59% sustainably powered as an industry, according to the Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry group including most of the large miners and fronted by big names including MicroStrategy (MSTR) chief and bitcoin enthusiast Michael Saylor. And as Schumacher pointed out, this does not include any carbon offsetting.  “I don’t know of any other industry that’s improving its power mix quite that rapidly,” Schumacher said.  The past year has also seen a rapid U-turn among power utilities that would previously not touch bitcoin mining, but are now banging on the door of firms like Marathon, having woken up to the fact this is a valuable way to use excess power, Schumacher said.  Shape of things to come  Looking ahead, bitcoin can also play a central part in the transition of energy grids to becoming more decentralized, Schumacher said, because community-based renewable energy projects could use bitcoin mining to become more economically viable, with potentially battery storage.  Another interesting trend would be power companies becoming the bitcoin miners of the future, something that’s being talked over right now and which would most likely happen via joint ventures, Schumacher said.  “Power companies own the single biggest input cost, since electricity is 70% of the input cost for a miner,” Schumacher said. “If you sell excess power to a bitcoin miner you charge, say, 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. But if [power companies] owned 100% of the bitcoin, at today’s prices it works out at more like 35-40 cents per kilowatt-hour.”  (A crypto mining source who asked to remain anonymous said a few power companies were among a rush of speculative new entrants back in 2017 when the price of bitcoin spiked, but that most found the infrastructure requirements were too daunting to proceed with. However, joint ventures in the future seem inevitable, the source said.)  Read more: What Does a Crypto Mining Farm Look Like? Striking Photos From Siberia to Spain  The possibility that power companies could become bitcoin miners has an interesting parallel in the world of proof-of-stake blockchains, where large telcos that provide infrastructure for such networks are also taking part in staking and crypto earning rewards, with the likes of Germany’s Deutsche Telekom leading the way.  Sustainable standards  In addition to plugging into a grid with a greener power mix, another arrow in the quiver for bitcoin miners is the use of renewable energy certificates (REC), the means by which many corporate entities pay a premium to promote more renewable energy use.  An accurate way of verifying the RECs has been created by decentralized data storage protocol Filecoin among its storage providers (the blockchain system’s equivalent to miners). And now an ambitious RECs platform tailored to bitcoin miners has been launched in the form of the Sustainable Bitcoin Standard (SBS).  SBS co-founder Bradford van Voorhees, who has worked on sustainable supply chains and responsible sourcing with brands such as The North Face, Wrangler, Timberland and Vans, understands very well that firms don’t change unless it’s good for business.  “The Sustainable Bitcoin Standard is a protocol that financially incentivizes or rewards bitcoin miners using verified clean energy sources,” he said. “It also allows institutional investors who have ESG mandates to add proof of sustainable mining to their bitcoin holdings. And it does the two of those without disrupting the fungibility of bitcoin in any way.”  The project, which was born out of the first Stacks accelerator cohort (the blockchain system formerly known as Blockstack), is at various stages of cooperation with 10 large miners, said van Voorhees, that are either publicly listed or extremely well-capitalized. The two that can be named at this stage are Bitdeer, the crypto mining platform spun out of Chinese chip manufacturing giant Bitmain; and sustainable energy-focused miner CleanSpark.  When a miner wins a block reward of Bitcoin, it is issued a matching amount of sustainable Bitcoin certificates (SBCs), which, like Bitcoin, are on-chain tokens divisible by 100 million. These tokens can be held or uncoupled from the Bitcoin coinbase and sold to institutional investors and ESG-focused investors, who can then match these to their Bitcoin holdings. Next month, the protocol will carry out its first end-to-end transaction from distribution of SBCs to a miner, to those being sold on to an ESG-focused investor, van Voorhees said.  RECs debate  The system is modeled on the renewable energy certificate (RECs) market in the U.S., in that it distributes a reward to miners, whose green credentials have first been verified by the Center for Resource Solutions, a third-party non-profit which works with the likes of Apple and Proctor and Gamble.  However, quantifying or auditing carbon offsetting and accounting for a possible variation in or duplication of renewable energy certification opens a whole new can of worms, such that the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), has removed RECs from its attempts to calculate how green the industry is.  When you are close to renewables, you have better access to them. That’s just a reality.  The problem with not counting RECs is that some Bitcoin miners want to get credit for relocating to another, greener power grid, according to Doug Miller the co-founder of clean energy platform Zero Labs.  “I think part of this happened as a result of miners relocating from China to North America and they’re trying to get credit for sourcing clean energy from the ‘greener grids’ they’ve relocated to without having done anything beyond moving,” said Miller via email. “They want credit without having the standard evidence/documentation (RECs), so it seems like they want credit for essentially doing nothing other than relocating.”  Speaking on behalf of the BMC, Core Scientific’s Feinstein said RECs were removed in the last quarter’s numbers because it was judged not to be feasible to compare different REC credits across a wide range of companies based all over the world.  “The purpose of the Bitcoin Mining Council is to educate globally on what’s going on in terms of Bitcoin mining and its energy footprint. The simpler the message is, the better,” Feinstein said in an interview.  With his long-time experience working with RECs, van Voorhees acknowledges the problem of creating a standard that will fly, pointing to the SBS’s use of Green-e RECs, which are “pretty much the pinnacle.”  He also adds his role is not to become an arbiter of what constitutes green or sustainable energy use; for instance, if methane miners, which burn flare gas at drill heads to power electricity generators, are actually helping to mitigate CO2 equivalents, then perhaps they should be included in the protocol as being sustainable, van Voorhees said.  “We are starting for now with North America and just organizations that are using renewable energy that is verified by using RECs that meet the Green-e standard,” said van Voorhees. “This is extremely stringent.”  More from CoinDesk’s Mining Week:  After Short-Lived Ban, City in Upstate NY Is Still Reckoning With Crypto Miners  Cities across the U.S. are grappling with what it means to have cryptocurrency mining operations in their communities. Plattsburgh, N.Y., offers a sobering case study. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week.

""This is almost like not letting the industry function, and what will happen is what happened to the drone industry where eventually the largest drone industry is in China,"" said Shetty, perhaps the most prominent face in crypto in India. ""Now all the foreign tech is going to dominate in India and we don't want that happening in crypto.""  He added the move is especially bad for India's younger people.  ""What we care most about is our customers. Millions earn a living through crypto. During the [coronavirus] pandemic, they lost jobs and crypto was one of the reasons people survived. We are concerned about the loss to their livelihood, their dreams ... these are people in the 18 to 30-year-old category,"" said Shetty.  Shetty's biggest objection was to the 1% tax deducted at source (TDS), which would be levied any time an Indian buys or sells crypto. ""The 1% TDS will kill liquidity, which means ultimately profitability goes down for everyone. It's a lose-lose,"" Shetty said.  What people will do now, according to Shetty, ""is find ways to not be part of the [domestic] system because people are not going to leave crypto.""  ""This will push people to other channels – peer to peer, one-to-one trading. As an industry, we had worked so hard to make sure everyone comes through the right way, millions through KYCs [know your customer protocols]. Now the other fear is that this will go back to the gray market or non-KYC approach,"" Shetty predicted.  The move to not allow crypto losses to offset gains is even worse than the 30% capital gains tax on crypto profits itself, said Shetty. He noted that in some cases Indian investors could lose more money than they invested because of the way the new taxes work.  ""No one will risk that,"" Shetty said.  Read more: Indian Prime Minister Calls for Global Cooperation on Cryptocurrency  ‘Nuclear approach’  Shetty, though, put up a brave face, saying, ""We cannot give up."" He cited the example of the 2018 effective ban by India's central bank to disallow banks from working with crypto exchanges. Back then, an appeal to the Supreme Court eventually resulted in a favorable verdict for exchanges.  ""With the banking ban, we went after it. It took two years but eventually the right thing happened. I think here, too, the right thing will happen but time, that period of pain, that will be there.""  So, will WazirX, as one of the largest exchanges in India's crypto industry, approach the Supreme Court this time?  ""If that is an option, it is a last, nuclear approach. Dialogue is going to be the best way so that everyone gets comfortable and understands the nuances of crypto as a sector, which is not understood well right now,"" he said.  CoinDesk had earlier reported that several crypto industry leaders confirmed they would consider appealing to the Supreme Court if the proposed crypto taxes were adopted as law.  CBDC is not competition for crypto  Historically, regulatory moves by the government regarding crypto have leaned towards deterrence rather than encouragement, with India's burgeoning crypto industry having to survive blow after blow.  First came the central bank ""ban"" and then legislation prohibiting “all private cryptocurrencies in India.” Later, the global euphoria over cryptocurrencies in 2020-2021 saw the government draft legislation ""enabling cryptocurrency to be used as an asset"" even as reports indicated that violations would result in a non-bailable warrant and/or fines and jail time.  One popular theory for why the government continues to stall crypto adoptionis it believes crypto represents competition for India's planned central bank digital currency (CBDC). The day India's crypto tax proposals were announced, Feb. 1, India said it would introduce a CBDC by FY 2022-23.  So is the government delaying crypto adoption until its CBDC is ready? Shetty says he thinks the fundamental idea that cryptocurrency would compete with a CBDC is inaccurate.  ""There is a difference between CBDC and another crypto. One is a currency and the other is an asset. CBDC is not a crypto killer. It is a currency. Why will you hold CBDC? You will use it for transactions, but are you going to say you will invest?"" Shetty said.  ‘Crypto will survive’  Despite the government's refusalto adopt suggestions from the industry, Shetty remains optimistic.  ""Discussions are still ongoing with the government. We are still waiting to have an industry meeting with the government,"" Shetty disclosed.  The disclosure is significant. Between the announcement of the tax proposals and their becoming law, a period of close to two months, the government met with individuals and one or two crypto exchanges, but Shetty confirmed that not one meeting occurred with the industry as a whole or its representatives.  Yet, he still feels the needle is moving towards more of an understanding between government and industry.  Asked how he can be so confident the government will come around when previous suggestions over discussions have been ignored, Shetty said that ""ultimately, technology always emerges, it always wins.""  India has not ruled out banning crypto altogether, and on Friday the finance minister said that ""consultations are going on as to whether we want to regulate it to some extent or really very much or totally ban it.""  However, Shetty is confident the government ""will never ban it,"" but there ""will be periods of pain. We just have to remove it quickly.""  According to Shetty, ""We are in a competition with the global world. If this was localized I would be very worried. So eventually, the government will realize it's losing market share and opportunities,"" which, if not grabbed, ""will be taken by other countries"" such as China or the U.S..

42417133,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSJwU9,1648228535,Exponential Software Requires Exponential Hardware,"Hardware is constantly evolving. Bitcoin (BTC) mining only needed Raspberry Pis in the very early days. Ethereum (ETH) could be mined with an average consumer laptop GPU. Now, validators on newer blockchains are required to have high-speed servers, gigabit internet connectivity and custom-built high performance hardware. The growth and demand of the hardware industry has never been greater.  This post is part of Mining Week. Sam Cassatt is the CEO and Founder of Aligned, a Web 3 infrastructure firm.  As blockchains continue to evolve and new innovations are created, so too will the demand for optimized computing – and further, the need for custom hardware. Just as Web 2 created the modern design of data centers, new Web 3 primitives will require the creation of a new structure of hardware, custom-built for the rapidly growing needs of the software.  Parallels between Web 2 and Web 3 computing demands  Web 1 was almost exclusively reading and writing simple http content. Fairly simple needs limited by our fairly simple hardware stack. The computers were bulky and slow, the internet was at broadband (or even dial-up) speeds, servers were bigger and more expensive to host, etc.  Then came Web 2 – the era of social media and streaming. As the technology grew, so did the demands of consumers. The new shifts in workload motivated the design of the Web 2 data center. Facebook (FB) needed to process massive real-time video streams that informed the architecture of their data centers. Apple (AAPL) created the M1 chip for users to maximize the Web 2-centric experience. AWS’s entire business is based on catering to the needs of Web 2 – closed servers for gated networks.  While Satoshi began mining bitcoin on commodity CPUs, the most efficient hashing hardware eventually became GPUs. Fast forward a few years, and bitcoin is mined at an institutional level on large networks of ASICs, custom computer chips designed specifically for the purpose of mining bitcoin and nothing else. This was the progression of the first Web 3 workload, born in the era of social media.  Mining is the most simplistic version of this hardware growth – the first chapter. As more and more networks continue to use proof-of-stake consensus models and as total value locked (TVL) continues to grow in decentralized finance (DeFi), the stakes get bigger, the demand for computation increases, creating the demand for better hardware and infrastructure.  Growing demand for high-performance computing  Currently, hashing is the main math that is deployed in blockchain architecture. Eventually, over time, our demands for blockspace will exceed the computational limits of networks based on hashing.  Zero-knowledge proofs are emerging as the next progression in the mathematical underpinnings of blockchain scaling. Zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups such as ZKSync, Polygon Hermez and many more are starting to allow scalability above layer 1, or base, chains. This type of advancement in Web 3 architecture will be necessary to handle the amount of on-chain activity to simultaneously hold massive industries such as DeFi, gaming, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and more.  The problem is that our traditional hardware is not built for zero-knowledge proofs. The general purpose processors of today are not designed for this type of computation, although they can do it however inefficiently. Over time, we will likely see the emergence of specialized hardware for this purpose, just as we eventually saw ASICs emerge for bitcoin mining once the computation was understood and solidified.  Similarly, miner extractable value (MEV) will ultimately be an optimization problem. Vitalik Buterin’s ""Endgame"" explores some of the future directions we are going, especially as block proposers and builders become separate. As this happens the amount of MEV per block will be optimized, likely creating a separate fee market for well-constructed blocks. Again, this will likely lead to hardware optimized solutions, seeking to optimize as far as we can go.  The Web 3 thesis  Everyone has slightly different imaginations of what Web 3 will ultimately look like. Regardless of your specific vision, if you believe in the Web 3 thesis of decentralization, open-source, permissionless access to the internet, you believe that eventually hardware workloads will get optimized. Right now, it is definitely not optimized, but as our demands continue to grow, technology continues to mature and so will the hardware that the next generation of the internet will be built upon.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Cassatt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/25/exponential-software-requires-exponential-hardware,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f192a84313fa9361c9485fb0c58fd14b2d681beb-3840x2560.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394297,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaoUf,1648226261,The Perils of Crypto's Pseudonymous Economy,"If crypto’s pseudonymous economy is to survive this era of NFT rug pulls and token Ponzinomics, then I’ve yet to see a reason why or how it should. We’re living through a massive digital whack-a-mole game. But these moles have mallets – Groucho Marx masks, too. Why, then, do we keep plunking quarters into their machine?  Take Thursday’s announcement of fraud charges against two organizers of the “Frosties” non-fungible token blowup. Federal prosecutors alleged 20-year-olds Ethan Nguyen and Andre Llacuna scammed investors in their million-dollar metaverse mumbo jumbo, a collection of cutesy JPEG PFPs (profile pics).  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Infected by FOMO (fear of missing out) and crypto hype culture, thousands of well-meaning if misguided victims didn’t know who was selling them a tin digital Spam. Some Frosties buyers eagerly dropped thousands of dollars on mint day. They didn’t start asking whodunit until after the rug had been pulled. Why bother vetting creators “Meltfrost” and “heyandre” in an ecosystem that lionizes the pseudonymous hack?  Therein lies the ... rug. Crypto and DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFTs and Web 3 have grown to adore pseudonymity’s romantic mystique. This makes perfect sense from a historical standpoint: Bitcoin’s Satoshi Nakamoto set a trillion-dollar precedent for keeping one’s real name under wraps. He or she or they created a financial disintermediation platform that didn’t know or care who used it. Years of open-source collaboration, auditing and innovation – and Satoshi’s early exit stage left – mean bitcoiners nary fret over the founder’s real name.  Earned trust?  Bitcoin earned our respect over a decade of growth. Its pseudonymous precedent is now being exploited by a new generation of scam-happy thieves. Carnival goldfish have longer, happier lives than these ringleaders' phony names.  Convicted felon and QuadrigaCX co-founder Michael Patryn rebranded himself as the systemically important treasurer of crypto project Wonderland, which at its height held over $700 million in assets. People were fine with Sifu, the pseudonymous founder. When on-chain sleuths doxxed him, though, they balked, ultimately voting him out of the project. Sifu didn’t have to run off with their money to pull the rug, in their minds. His potholed past was indictable enough.  If people cared who Sifu was after his unmasking, then there’s no conceivable reason why they shouldn’t have demanded that information on opening day. You can’t blame Sifu, really: He was just following route procedure. We spin ourselves a tale of riches that charlatans – especially those with toxic pasts – inevitably embrace.  Crypto is beginning to grapple with its self-imposed fables. Perhaps spooked by billions of dollars in rug pulls, a growing number of pseudonymous founder-led projects are now taking steps to bolster their raison d'être. Some retain their outward-facing mystery by telling retail investors that the whales (large investors) know their real names. Others pay big bucks for boutique vendors to perform “know-your-customer” (KYC) checks in exchange for a pretty label that marks them as known privately.  Third parties  Take RugDoc.io. In one year, the review website has built community trust by spotting and shaming shady DeFi projects. This service laudably warns users which products are programmed to rug and which appear safe. It’s a free service available on request.  The website also sells “RUGDOC KYC.” For $5,000-plus, it will perform “extensive real-time identity verification as well as professional vetting through our trusted third party vendor.” After verifying the founders’ identity (which it keeps under wraps) RugDoc awards them a “pristine KYC badge” to flaunt before RugDoc’s “100k+ monthly unique visitors.”  I’ve been around this industry long enough to know that “trusted third parties'' are anathema to the origins of crypto. We don’t know who runs RugDoc. We certainly don’t know who its “trusted third party” is. When asked in the project’s Discord, the mod Mr. Onion demurred. “Making them public could open up vulnerabilities,” the mod said.  See also: Why CoinDesk Respects Pseudonymity: A Stand Against Doxxing | Opinion  It is definitionally impossible to trust a third party when the party is unknown. Dozens of projects still pay big money to run their gamut, which RugDoc calls a deterrent. RugDoc’s own website admits at least two pulled the rug.  We’re dumping millions of dollars in an ecosystem whose solution to a problem of its own making is a banner ad antithetical to crypto’s philosophical core. Pretty words and self-principles are trouncing our own credulity. Then when it goes down the porcelain throne, we cry boo-hoo and move on to the next.  It’s only by a combination of sheer luck and post-teenage stupidity that the feds caught up with the alleged founders of Frosties. According to court documents, a federal investigator subpoenaed messaging app Discord, crypto exchange Coinbase, internet service providers and banks to quite speedily tie two real-world identities to “heyandre” and “Meltfrost.” Two months from crime to charges is a legal blitzkrieg, to be sure.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Past data suggests faster Federal Reserve rate hikes may not lead to renewed bitcoin weakness.  Featured stories: Anchor Protocol to readjust interest rates each month.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Fernando Martínez, managing director and head of Americas, OSL.  Darren Lim, research analyst, Nansen.  Mónica Taher, technological and economic international affairs commerce and investments secretariat, government of El Salvador.  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Federal Reserve (Fed) officials are calling for faster monetary policy tightening via interest-rate hikes in increments of 0.5 percentage point (50 basis points) in the coming months. Such an approach contrasts with the more cautious and steady-as-she-goes 0.25 percentage point rate hikes that the U.S. central bank has typically done in recent years.  Would an acceleration of the monetary tightening lead to a big rally in the U.S. dollar and a deeper decline in risk assets, including bitcoin? Probably not, if history is any guide.  ""The Fed needs to move aggressively to keep inflation under control. We need to get to neutral at least so we're not putting upward pressure on inflation during this period when we have much higher inflation than we're used to in the U.S.,"" Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard told Bloomberg early this week.  ""Faster is better. The 1994 tightening cycle or removal of accommodation cycle is probably the best analogy here,"" Bullard replied when asked how fast the Fed should raise rates.  Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Tuesday that bigger rate hikes would probably be needed at ""some"" of the remaining six Fed meetings this year.  The 1994 tightening cycle, which began in February of that year and lasted for 12 months, saw the central bank lift rates by 300 basis points, of which 225 basis points of tightening came through three 50 basis point hikes and one 75 basis point hike.  Interest rate rises typically bode well for the domestic currency, especially when the tightening cycle is as steep. However, the U.S. dollar, a global reserve that often acts as a safe haven during risk aversion, fell in 1994.  ""The way the dollar traded in 1994 was quite interesting. In theory, this should have been a dollar rip year. The Fed raised rates 'preemptively' against rising inflation. There were already worrying signs in EM, which resulted in the Tequila Crisis at the end of 1994,"" Jon Turek, author of Cheap Convexity blog, said in an analysis published on March 23. EM stands for emerging markets, such as Mexico and Brazil.  ""However, despite weakening EM and an outwardly hawkish Fed, the dollar in ‘94 basically followed its usual hiking cycle analog, peaking into the first hike and falling subsequently,"" Turek added.  The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value, slipped more than 7% to 88.98 in 1994.  So, bitcoin bulls have a reason to be optimistic despite the heightened prospects of the Fed delivering faster rate hikes in the coming months.  Traders, however, should keep an eye on the DXY's daily chart, which shows the greenback has formed a bull flag, a continuation pattern. It means a potential breakout would open the doors for an extended move to the higher side, possibly bringing temporary bearish pressure for bitcoin and gold.  The DXY fell 0.9% last week as the Fed raised rates by 25 basis points, kicking off the tightening cycle. Further, the central bank raised inflation forecasts and signaled seven quarter percentage point hikes for this year.  Bitcoin was better bid at press time, trading 8% higher for the week at $44,600. The cryptocurrency rose 9% last week. Unconfirmed reports suggesting that a foundation focused on UST, the world's fourth-largest stablecoin, is accumulating bitcoin seem to have stirred investor interest in the top cryptocurrency.

42407279,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVUNK3,1648216344,How Northern Italian Hydropower Producers Became Bitcoin Miners,"TRENTINO, ITALY – Daniele Graziadei, the 37-year-old mayor of Borgo d’Anaunia, a small municipality in the northern Italian region of Trentino-Alto Adige, entered the 100-year-old Alta Novella hydropower plant with familiar ease, with hands in his jean pockets and sporting a baseball cap.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Mining Week  This year, under the leadership of Graziadei, Borgo d’Anaunia, home to around 2,500 people, became Italy’s first municipality to run a crypto data center. Whirring away on a small shelf at the far end of Alta Novella’s historic turbine room are 40 state-of-the-art application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) machines powering the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin.  Under pressure over rising energy costs, and concerned about achieving climate goals, some regulators and parliamentarians in the European Union are looking to outlaw proof-of-work, the energy-intensive computing method that powers the Bitcoin network. But in Italy, this same mechanism has become an economic incentive for hydropower producers to continue or expand their renewable energy production.  The northern Italian regions bordering the snowy Alps are home to dozens of hydroelectric power plants in a range of sizes, thanks to the abundance of water and varying altitudes. Alta Novella had belonged to Borgo d’Anaunia since the 1960s, but then it was abandoned because of the absence of a dam. There was no way of controlling the Novella river, Graziadei said.  Read More: What Does a Crypto Mining Farm Look Like? Striking Photos From Siberia to Spain  In 2008, the municipality decided to open the facility again by changing the turbine, and the Italian government granted the facility some monetary incentives.  But this past winter, there was little rain and snow in Borgo d’Anaunia, Graziadei said. When CoinDesk visited in February, still in the dead of winter, the landscape framing the valley was mostly free of snow, except for a dangerous layer of thin ice on the road that led down to the facility.  When production is low, running and maintaining a hydropower plant becomes an expensive burden.  “If there is no snow that increases water levels in the river, electricity production is low, and during these months in previous years, we would shut down the facility for maintenance,” Graziadei said.  The state incentives, which included purchasing the power produced by the facility at 0.20 euros (around $0.22) instead of at the standard price of around $0.06, had expired a few years ago.  But when CoinDesk visited, despite the relatively dry conditions, the plant was still running: The small amount of energy being produced was used to run a few of the bitcoin mining machines.  “In periods like this winter when there has been little precipitation, and the amount of water the river brings is very low, this new technology is allowing us to maximize production and therefore give higher value to our facility,” Graziadei said in Italian, adding, “Even if the water levels are low, [mining] allows us to keep the facility in production.”  Indeed, Graziadei’s main motivation for setting up a data center at the municipal hydropower plant was economic. The municipality doesn’t actually mine or trade bitcoin. Alps Blockchain, the Italian tech company that set up the mining farm at Alta Novella and carries out maintenance, simply purchases the computing power produced by the facility’s mining farm for at least 35% more than what the government pays for its energy. Alps Blockchain sells the computing power purchased from the facility to bitcoin mining pools around the world.  Graziadei, who dabbles in crypto trading himself, said it wasn’t that hard to convince the city council and his constituents to set up the data center: In the absence of the government’s incentives, they had to find a way to cover maintenance costs of the facility and turn it into a sustainable revenue source for the municipality.  “Income from [the Alta Novella power plant] is used for the maintenance of the facility, and for the municipality’s public work in service of the community,” Graziadei said.  Alta Novella is one of 18 hydropower plants in northern Italy that now house a mining farm set up by Alps Blockchain. The company aims to double that number by the end of the year.  Alps Blockchain  Alps Blockchain, the Italian startup behind the slew of hydropower plants that are contributing to the Bitcoin network, was founded by two 23-year-olds from Trento, a northern Italian city dubbed “Bitcoin Valley” because of its early interest in cryptocurrencies.  Co-founders Francesca Failoni and Francesco Buffa met while working as event planners a few years ago. They became interested in blockchain thanks in part to its influence around them.  Failoni, in a clean-cut pantsuit, is commanding in a man’s world of energy and tech, while Buffa, in his black turtleneck and glasses, leaves little doubt in your mind about who he aspires to be. When CoinDesk visited in February, the young entrepreneurs were moving their team into an expansive office space in Trento.  Read More: Bitcoin Mining and ESG: A Match Made in Heaven  Failoni, the chief financial officer at Alps Blockchain, said they wanted to participate and build in the blockchain world, but mining bitcoin themselves proved to be a challenge because of high energy prices.  Mining bitcoin at home in Italy means paying at least $0.22 per kilowatt hour. By comparison, household energy costs around $0.138 per kilowatt hour on average in the U.S.  “The price of the energy you buy from the grid is higher than the rest of the world,” Failoni said. “But we understood that renewable energy producers sell energy at a far lower price than what we buy from the grid.”  The duo began studying the mining sector and discovered that there was a shift toward the use of renewable energy for powering energy-intensive crypto networks like the proof-of-work verification system used for Bitcoin. They also found that some hydropower producers in northern Italy were struggling to keep their plants profitable once government incentives expired.  “We realized that they can self-consume the energy they are producing … That can be an alternative to the state incentives, that is, using some part of the energy produced to create computing power,” Failoni said.  According to Buffa, who is Alps Blockchain’s CEO, it wasn’t easy to educate hydropower producers who were unfamiliar with crypto, about how mining worked.  “But once they understood, the hydro sector is small, so word of mouth helped. The second problem was finding money to buy machines and push forward the business,” Buffa said, adding that talking to banks and convincing investors about the merits of blockchain technology was a challenge.  Although the hydropower plant owners make the investment in setting up a farm, Alps Blockchain handles everything from purchasing mining equipment to setting the machines up and maintaining them. It also helps each facility with tax reporting.  Failoni said his company’s hydropower mining farms are custom-made based on their production capabilities, their size and the owner’s willingness to invest. For instance, Alps Blockchain set up a special payment plan for the small farm at Alta Novella: To shield the municipality from the volatility in the crypto markets, the company purchases a portion of the computing power produced at the facility at a fixed rate.  During the 2021 crypto bull market, Buffa said the Alps Blockchain hydropower plants made up to 400% more than usual. Alps Blockchain’s own revenue rose 18 times from 2020 to 2021.  “This allowed Alps Blockchain and [the hydropower plants] to develop their business. Having margins and making more money, they bought more computers, they refurbished the plants and they created more computing power centers,” Buffa said.  Alps Blockchain mining farms are small operations compared with larger mining facilities in the U.S. and European countries like Sweden that host thousands of mining rigs. Alps Blockchain’s hydropower plants house between 20 and 600 ASIC (s19 pro or s19j) mining rigs generating between 2,000 and 60,000 terahashes per second.  In February, CoinDesk also visited one of the company’s other facilities in the Veneto region – a larger hydropower plant (also a century old) in the municipality of Valstagna that has 300 machines and that is in the process of adding 150 more.  The Valstagna hydropower plant is one facility belonging to a large local energy company. According to Giacomo Magoni, who manages the mining project at the power plant, the plant has been self-consuming 20-25% of its total production to generate computing power since July 2020. During CoinDesk’s visit, only a 10th of the 10 megawatt facility’s production was being self-consumed.  “We decided to take this road in generating computing power to diversify our business and to become a forward-looking company,” Magoni said in Italian.  The energy company’s main goal is to provide as much clean energy to the national grid as possible, Magoni said, adding that profits from its mining operation are being invested in the company’s expansion into multiple renewable energy sectors including hydro and wind power.  Regulatory concerns over crypto mining  In November, Swedish financial and environmental regulators published an open letter calling for a ban on crypto mining in the EU over energy concerns.  “Sweden needs the renewable energy targeted by crypto-asset producers for the climate transition of our essential services, and increased use by miners threatens our ability to meet the Paris Agreement,” the letter said.  Read More: After Short-Lived Ban, City in Upstate NY Is Still Reckoning With Crypto Miners  Since then, a growing number of politicians in the EU have been fiercely campaigning for laws directed at limiting the use of energy-intensive cryptocurrencies in the bloc. The EU crypto-energy debate reached its most recent climax earlier this month when a committee vote in the European Parliament narrowly defeated a proposed provision looking to outlaw cryptocurrencies that cannot switch from the proof-of-work consensus mechanism into more environmentally friendly methods such as proof-of-stake.  Bitcoin, powered by proof-of-work, would have effectively been banned in the EU under the measure.  “We narrowly lost the vote, but the debate on this continues. Clear ecological criteria will come sooner or later, and then cryptocurrencies that optimize their energy consumption will prevail. Others will disappear,” EU parliamentarian Rasmus Andresen, who supported the provision that would require cryptocurrencies to meet climate standards in the EU, said on Twitter.  It is unclear if Italian hydropower producers that are self-consuming portions of their production to power the bitcoin network would appease the concerns of lawmakers and regulators in the EU.  For instance, Valstagna’s Mangoni said that, to some extent, the volatility of energy prices and the profitability of mining dictate where the energy produced at the plant goes.  “We constantly monitor the fluctuation of these two values, and we decide whether to put the energy in the grid or take advantage of generating computing power,” Mangoni said.  On the other hand, Failoni argues that without the mining farms, Valstagna wouldn’t be able to invest in expanding its renewable energy production, while Alta Novella would have been shut down altogether this winter, unable to cover costs.  Failoni says the renewable energy sector in Italy and the crypto economy both stand to benefit from robust and clear regulations that target efficiency levels of mining machines instead of specific consensus mechanisms.  “One thing that makes this kind of activity very energy-consuming is that … the hardware used is not efficient. If they can make some regulations about using only efficient miners, using only renewable energy sources, this kind of sector would change for sure,” Failoni said.  Graziadei, the mayor, says that he has no plans to expand the computing center at the Alta Novella power plant and that it’s perfectly calibrated to the needs of the plant – just enough to keep it running and well-maintained. He urges regulators to understand the technology.  “I read some proposals, but they were never very well argued,” Graziadei said.“I advise them to understand the functioning of the tech.”  When asked what would happen to the energy that is not consumed by the 300 mining rigs at Valstagna, Mangoni said all of it would go to the national grid.  “[The grid] always buys it because in Italy, we consume more than we produce in all the hours of the day,” Mangoni said.

42375030,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw59kJ,1648215644,Jump Crypto Wants You to Know Its Name,"Jump Crypto, the cryptocurrency arm of the decades-old trading firm Jump Trading Group, is stepping into the spotlight – not as traders, but as builders.  In a presentation – titled “Who the F**k Is Jump?” – Jump Crypto President Kanav Kariya unveiled the extent of the historically secretive firm’s crypto operations at the Avalanche Summit in Barcelona, Spain. He wore a neon-orange puffer coat and flip-flops.  Jump Crypto has emerged as a uniquely powerful presence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, branching further from its trading roots to become active builders, investors, governance voters and community members. The firm even executed what some observers called DeFi’s first bailout, putting up $320 million that was exploited in a hack of the Jump-backed Wormhole cross-chain bridge.  “Before, there was no need for marketing,” explained Kariya, who rose to head the multibillion-dollar crypto operation after joining Jump in 2017 as an intern. “But crypto is different – we’re building a whole bunch of stuff. We made our first marketing hire three months ago.”  The firm now dominates every aspect of the crypto ecosystem – operating a market-making business, a venture capital arm and, increasingly, a team of in-house developers who contribute to projects on several major blockchains.  According to Kariya, Jump Crypto now employs approximately 140, with over 100 being developers. Half of the developers are focused on trading, while the other half are on the ground, shipping code for protocols.  They’re “writing Rust for Solana and Solidity for AVAX and Ethereum,” Kariya said, in reference to the programming languages that power the three blockchains. “We’re builders first.”  Venture BUIDLers  The investors-as-builders strategy appears to be a growing trend, with venture giants Paradigm and Polychain Capital also expanding their research teams with talented developers who are able to build out key features for their portfolio projects.  Some of Jump’s biggest engineering bets have been on core crypto infrastructure, such as decentralized exchanges (Serum), oracles (Pyth) and Wormhole, the aforementioned bridge that had structural integrity issues in February.  “Many people asked me, ‘Why did you plug the $300 million dollar hole?’” Kariya said at the conference. “The default pieces of infrastructure that are responsible for communication across chains are going to be highly value-creative. … It’s never an easy decision, but we were able to do it quickly, and it was the right decision to make.”  In an industry where major decisions are frequently debated on open governance forums, Jump appears to be using its name to gain influence within the community.  Another priority of Jump’s is staying ahead of developments in market structure, according to Kariya.  He also hinted at possible Jump subnets, the application-specific blockchains that the Avalanche Foundation has committed 4 million AVAX tokens to attract.  “We’re exploring a few subnets with the Avalanche team,” he said on stage, adding the effort was “still largely explorative.”  “We’re excited about what they’re doing,” Kariya added.",POSITIVE,AVAX,AVAX | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/25/jump-crypto-wants-you-to-know-its-name,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41baf240e5883241d00edb13c1a13ab16be89e71-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Riley said in a research note issued Thursday after the market close.  “While many other miners aim for carbon neutrality, TeraWulf is entering the space using zero-carbon resources from the start,” wrote analyst Lucas Pipes about the company, which went public in December and is backed by celebrities such as actress Gwyneth Paltrow.  Pipes, who is the only analyst covering the stock, according to FactSet data, initiated coverage of TeraWulf with a buy rating and 12-month price target of $24 per share, implying 159% upside from Thursday’s closing price of $9.28.  On Thursday, shares of TeraWulf were up 11.7% and they were rising roughly 6% in early trading on Friday. The stock has fallen about 36% this year, underperforming the mining-heavy Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto-Mining & Semiconductor exchange-traded fund (RIGZ), which was down 17%.  The miner is using 100% zero-carbon nuclear energy at its Nautilus Cryptomine facility in Pennsylvania and at its Lake Mariner site in upstate New York. The company is using power from the grid through a deal with the New York Power Authority, whose mix is 90% carbon-free primarily using hydropower, Pipes said.  Pipes also noted TeraWulf has an experienced management team that has worked in energy infrastructure and power management, and cited the miner’s joint venture deal with Talen Energy which enables the company to lock-in longer-term power contracts.  On March 17, TeraWulf said it sees itself reaching a hashrate range of 4.7 to 5.1 exahash per second (EH/s) by the end of 2022 and 23 EH/s of mining capacity by 2025.

42375021,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw59Yz,1648208246,India Passes Stiff Crypto Tax Laws Despite Industry Uproar,"Indians will begin paying a capital gains tax of 30% on crypto transactions in just one week after Parliament passed a controversial tax proposal on Friday, sparking uproar and disappointment among those in the country's crypto industry.  In addition to the capital gains tax, Indians buying or selling crypto will have to pay a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS), as well as taxes on crypto gifts, with no ability to take deductions for losses. The crypto taxes will come into effect on April 1, while the TDS will start on July 1.  What the government said  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the proposal and steered it through the lower house of Parliament. While the upper house can and did make suggestions, its role in finance legislation in India is minimal.  More than 20 members of the lower house of Parliament reacted strongly to the bill, criticizing the lack of clarity in defining crypto in the bill, with several members of Parliament saying that the crypto taxes will ""finish the industry.""  Sitharaman responded by saying that “there is no confusing signal"" and we “have been very clear that consultations are going on as to whether we want to regulate it to some extent or really very much or totally ban it."" She said that the government is taxing crypto because people are profiting from it.  She added that the TDS is “more for tracking, it is not an additional or new tax"" and that ""TDS can always be reconciled with the total tax to be paid to the government.""  Industry responds  India’s crypto industry was overwhelming in its response, calling the passing of the bill without favorable amendments “more harmful than good” and “one that will hamper the overall growth of the industry.”  “This is not conducive for the government or the crypto ecosystem of India, it is poised to do more harm than good,"" said Nischal Shetty, one of the most prominent crypto voices in India and co-founder and CEO of WazirX, one of India’s largest crypto exchanges.  “This can result in cascading participation on Indian exchanges and lead to a rise in capital outflow to foreign exchanges,"" Shetty said.  Earlier, Sumit Gupta, CEO of CoinDCX, a prominent exchange in India, said that the “tax provisions can kill the crypto industry,” and Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO of Unocoin, another crypto exchange, said that “it was sad none of their (the industry's) requests had been implemented.”  “This will have some repercussions on traders, especially the 1% TDS assessment. This will not only affect traders but also tax collections. We hope that in the subsequent years the crypto industry gets treated like other investment-related industries,” Vishwanath said.  The reaction was no different among NFT (non-fungible token) marketplaces.  “Witnessing no amendments in the crypto taxation policies have discouraged firms and investors from investing in the volatile market. This will hamper the overall growth of the sector by reducing mass adoption and its validation,” said Abhay Aggarwal, CEO and founder of NFT marketplace Colexion.  Global exchange OKX (previously OKEx) was the rare entity that saw the bright side in the passage of the bill.  “A tax on certain assets indicates that those assets are recognized tradable asset class by the regulator. That gives the industry a lot more clarity on the legal status of crypto and its derived income. Hence it’s good news for the industry in India with respect to building a more regulated operating environment for crypto,” said Lennix Lai, director of OKX.  Shivam Thakral, CEO of Indian exchange BuyUcoin, was also optimistic, saying “the government did best to their knowledge."" He noted that the government tends to move slowly but that it will understand the crypto industry better once it sees trading volumes on crypto exchanges drop.  Supreme Court challenge next?  Rajat Mittal, a tax counsel in India's Supreme Court advising crypto businesses, also weighed in against the new law.  “The government has not accepted any suggestions of the crypto industry to tone down the crypto taxation but has in fact tightened the taxation rules making it tougher and perhaps, almost impossible for daily traders and the exchanges to conduct activities in India,” he said.  The crypto industry had fought against this bill after the taxes were first proposed in February, supplementing meetings with lawmakers with a change.org petition and an online campaign. There was some hope the capital gains tax or TDS might be eased, but that didn't happen.  CoinDesk previously reported that the industry had discussed a Supreme Court challenge if crypto taxes weren't reduced. It is unlikely that the industry will move forward with such a challenge immediately but still is considering that option.  “If such an option exists, it is the last nuclear approach,” WazirX's Shetty said.  Read more: Indian Crypto Industry Mulls Supreme Court Move as Tax Break Expectations Disappear  Most in the industry including Shetty have been pushing to discuss the taxes with the government and the law seems to have moved the needle toward a court challenge only marginally.  BuyUCoin's Thakral said “collaborating is much better than fighting” and suggested that the government will see the impact of the taxes and make changes soon. The option of approaching the top court is not needed until to at least July 1, and by that time, he hopes the industry would have intensified its efforts to reduce the TDS.  “That is something we are careful about. The Supreme Court won’t consider petitions against high taxes by the government on a particular category of asset. Regardless, all the key players including us in the crypto industry have already come together to take constructive steps,” Aggarwal of Colexion said.

In the past few days, EU lawmakers have been negotiating a mandate for the proposed landmark legislation for digital assets, which does not contain a provision seeking to limit the use of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies in the EU, before it moves on to the trilogue negotiations between the parliament, council and commission.  Earlier in the week, Stefan Berger, the parliamentarian overseeing the MiCA framework, expressed concerns that other EU leaders in favor of limiting the use of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies would make one last attempt to take the legislation to a full parliamentary vote ahead of the trilogue.  The parliament has not challenged the negotiation mandate for MiCA, Berger tweeted early on Friday. The deadline for challenging the mandate ended at midnight on Thursday, according to Berger.  The provision in question was defeated in a close committee vote on March 14.  EU officials are also debating a number of issues including the inclusion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) in the MiCA package, as well as which EU agencies should be given supervision powers over the crypto space.  Berger said the MiCA trilogue is set to begin next week.

42375029,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw59hn,1648205239,EU Passes Law to ‘Rein In’ Big Tech’s Domination Over Smaller Players,"European Union lawmakers hailed a “new era in tech regulation” after passing legislation Friday that would enable massive fines on dominant players such as Alphabet's (GOOG) Google and Amazon (AMZN).  The Digital Markets Act has been cited by lawmakers as a major part of the EU’s plans to regulate the internet, alongside more targeted laws for specific innovations like cryptoassets.  The new law aims to help smaller players compete with the big beasts – but has raised hackles in the U.S., whose companies the law mostly targets.  Under the rules, finally hammered out in an eight-hour meeting between lawmakers and governments Thursday night, Google and Meta (FB) could face restrictions on their ability to issue targeted ads, Apple (AAPL) could need to offer app developers fair access to features like the iPhone’s near-field communication chip, and texting services like Meta’s WhatsApp and Apple’s iMessage will have to work together with smaller platforms.  Any tech giant that ranks its own products higher than competitors, misuses personal data or otherwise offers unfair access could face a merger ban, a forced break-up or fines as high as 20% of annual worldwide turnover.  “For companies that play a role as ‘gatekeepers,’ the Digital Markets Act will set the rules of the game,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told reporters Friday, comparing the law to previous attempts to break up monopolies in sectors like telecoms, transportation and banking.  Agreement on the law “shows willingness for our democracy to say we will rein this in,” she added. “We will show the market is open and contestable.”  Vestager has taken a slew of high-profile digital antitrust cases. In 2018 she fined Google 4.34 billion euros ($4.78 billion), saying that requirements to install Google search on Android phones was unlawful. The company has challenged that finding in EU courts – but Brussels is tired of simply spotting and correcting individual cases of market malpractice.  “When things become systemic, we need regulation as well,” Vestager said.  Lead lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who negotiated for the European Parliament on the law, on Friday told reporters the plans were a “new era in tech regulation,” but added that he didn’t want to see the EU digital market break off from the rest of the world as a result of the new rules.  The plans, alongside a related, not-yet-agreed law known as the Digital Services Act, were in December criticized by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, who said she had “serious concerns that these proposals will disproportionately impact U.S. tech firms.”  The new law was hailed by consumer organizations for its potential to promote innovation.  “This legislation will rebalance digital markets, increase consumer choice and put an end to many of the worst practices that Big Tech has engaged in over the years,” said Ursula Pachl, deputy director general at Brussels consumer lobbyists BEUC in an emailed statement, citing practices like app stores that force the use of proprietary digital payment services.  But big internet players remain understandably skeptical. DIGITALEUROPE, a Brussels lobby group that represents all the major big tech companies, expressed reservations about the newly agreed framework.  “The aim of creating fairness and contestability is certainly valid,” Director-General Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl told CoinDesk in an emailed statement, but said that proposals on requiring sharing of data and the interoperability of services “lack clarity” and still need more work.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/25/eu-passes-law-to-rein-in-big-techs-domination-over-smaller-players,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/997550a6b445ef84eae962005d8f72de6e7bb69e-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375035,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw59qb,1648205226,Bitcoin Tops $44K Amid Rumors of Terra's Foundation Accumulating BTC,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain ground amid unconfirmed reports suggesting that a foundation focused on UST, the world's fourth-largest stablecoin, is accumulating the top cryptocurrency as a reserve asset.  CoinDesk data shows that bitcoin tapped three-week highs of over $44,000 early Friday. The cryptocurrency has rallied more than 10% since the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) raised borrowing costs by 25 basis points on March 16.  The rumor mill is that Singapore-based nonprofit Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) purchased bitcoin worth $125 million (2,840 BTC at the current price) early this week, delivering on its month-old promise to add BTC as an additional layer of security for UST – Terra's decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoin.  Stablecoin tether (USDT) worth $125 million was recently moved from a Gnosis safe address allegedly owned by Terra, perhaps evidence of the purchase, as CoinDesk's Christine Lee noted on Thursday.  According to Anthony Pompliano, the popular crypto evangelist and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, the foundation has become a persistent bitcoin buyer. ""They are slowly purchasing $3 billion of bitcoin from the Luna Foundation reserves. This is being done via aggressive buying on price dips,"" Pompliano noted in blog post published on Monday.  According to pseudonymous market expert and Anchor Protocol user Duo Nine, who operates the Twitter handle @DU09BTC, LFG has accumulated 18,000 bitcoin worth over $800 million.  The official confirmation of the said purchases is still awaited. The foundation announced the decision to build a $1 billion bitcoin reserve last month. Do Kwon, founder and CEO of Terraform Labs, recently said that the foundation has plans to increase its reserves to $3 billion, with a long-term goal of raising a $10 billion fund.  While the jury remains out on the size of the foundation's recent purchases, the speculation, along with the post-Fed rally in equities, appears to be boding well for bitcoin.  ""[There is] decent bid in crypto markets driven by excitement over institutional participation, building ETH merge narrative, and (unconfirmed) a $125 million BTC purchase by Luna Foundation Guard,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email early this week.  Analysts remain confident of the near-term prospects. ""We are at the upper band of resistance currently as BTC approached 2022 highs. With the spot flow we have been seeing, we are cautiously optimistic that there will be a continuation of the medium-term uptrend and a run to $50,000,"" Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said.  Data tracked by Glassnode shows the number of coins held on centralized exchanges has dropped to 2,506,635 BTC, the lowest since September 2018. More than 7,000 coins have left exchanges in less than a week, offering bullish cues to the market.

With the new proposal, payout rates would increase by 1.5% if yield reserves increase and drop by 1.5% if yield reserves fall by 5%. The payout rate change will be capped at 1.5%, which means that this is the maximum they can increase or decrease by.  The move is aimed at making Anchor more sustainable in the longer term. Anchor used to offer payout rates of up to 20% for depositing UST, Terra's dollar-pegged stablecoin.  Yield reserves are the amount of capital held on Terra to sustain its current 19.5% yield rate. Anchor locks over $14.76 billion worth of tokens and is the largest lending tool on Terra, according to tracking data.  Anchor’s interest rates are generated via staking rewards from major proof-of-stake blockchains and are hence considered more stable than money market interest rates.  Meanwhile, some Anchor users criticized the development on the proposal’s official discussion forum. “Anchor’s competitive advantage is a STABLE deposit rate. If we switch to a dynamic rate we’re giving up on that advantage,” pseudonymous user ‘fulltimecrypto' wrote. Other users were more upbeat. “We’re big enough now. It’s time to mature a bit and realize 20% on stables is excessive,” said ‘DefiantProtocol.’ “Cutting the rate in half wouldn’t lead to a significant flight of capital.”  Rates are currently set to drop by 1.5% as the yield reserves fell last month.

42435197,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBu76a,1648173740,Former Party Organizer Indicted for Laundering $2.7M in Bitcoin and Cash,"The Manhattan (N.Y.) District Attorney has charged a former party organizer with laundering $2.7 million in bitcoin (BTC) and cash to help multiple clients hide money they allegedly earned from illegal activities.  In a statement issued Thursday, the Manhattan DA alleged that between January 2018 and August 2021, 42-year-old Thomas Spieker converted over $2.3 million into bitcoin, and separately, more than $380,000 of bitcoin into U.S. dollars, via ""a rotating set of accomplices"" who opened bank and crypto exchange accounts to enable the laundering of ""criminal proceeds.""  “As alleged, this sprawling web of international money laundering helped drug traffickers, an organized crime ring, and scammers hide their criminal activity and transmit their proceeds around the globe,” DA Alvin Bragg said in the announcement. “This case shows us how new technologies like cryptocurrency can become key drivers of a wide range of criminal activity that can easily span across the globe.""  Spieker, who pleaded not guilty in New York State Supreme Court, faces multiple counts of unlicensed money transmission and money laundering in the third and fourth degrees. His LinkedIn profile listed his most recent jobs as a partner in a talent agency and the founder of the party production firm, S!ck Productions. Earlier in his career, he spent over two years as an equity derivatives specialist at Goldman Sachs (GS).  Dustin Sites, 32, whom the DA says aided Spieker in the scheme, faces one count of unlicensed money transmission. Several of Spieker's clients, whom the prosecutor also investigated, face charges on running an illegal drug marketplace on the dark web and an identify theft scheme, the latter of which allegedly victimized 30 people.  The complaint alleges that in 2014 Spieker began researching the phrase ""bitcoin money laundering"" in Google searches, and that he wrote a Facebook post saying that his services were for individuals ""who wanted to stay completely off the radar,"" with an understanding that they were engaged in illegal activity.  Spieker and three three proxies, including Sites, allegedly met with clients who handed them cash in exchange for bitcoin, or ""vice versa,"" and collected a 4% to 12% fee. Spieker and his accomplices allegedly opened 28 bank accounts and eight cryptocurrency exchange accounts.  Ricky Patel, the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York agent overseeing the investigation, said in the announcement that Spieker had ""openly bragged about laundering illicit proceeds.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/25/former-party-organizer-indicted-for-laundering-27m-in-bitcoin-and-cash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91dbe1d5ff591585802d56e7ca868aa87eab57f7-507x338.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394263,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaok3,1648172392,"Web 3 Needs Africa, Not the Other Way Around","What continent is home to the second-largest bitcoin (BTC) market, a government-introduced central bank digital currency (CBDC) and crypto market growth of more than $100 billion in the past year?  Maybe you would say North America, with its bevvy of crypto companies. Or in Latin America, with adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in countries like El Salvador. Or perhaps Asia comes to mind, where crypto markets continue to grow at a fast pace.  But the answer is Africa.  Elizabeth Rossiello is the CEO and founder of global fintech AZA Finance (previously BitPesa).  According to the ""Africa Report,"" in September 2021 the continent's crypto market reached a significant milestone when sub-Saharan users achieved more than $80 million in cryptocurrency holdings – more than the total of U.S. users. Morocco, a North African country with a gross domestic product ranking well outside the world’s top 50 (the U.S. is first), has one of the highest crypto-holding populations, with 2.5% of people owning some form of digital currency.  Read More: Africa 'Is Leading Global Cryptocurrency Adoption’: Paxful CEO  From 2020 to 2021, the continent saw an astounding 1,200% increase in crypto payments. This growth is no surprise to the AZA finance team. In the past nine years operating on the continent, we have seen massive increases in adoption of the new technology, thanks largely to a young and mobile population ready to plug into the digital world.  Early embrace of mobile money  Before crypto, African countries were embracing mobile money. In 2007, the first mobile money company, M-Pesa, created a tsunami of change in the way people on the continent spent and stored money. The launch of mobile money in Kenya was a runaway success with M-Pesa dominating over 99% of the market share.  This success led to widespread adoption of mobile money. Now, more than 60% of all global mobile money transactions flow through Africa. The continent's population has proven that it is excited to adopt new technology.  Africa has historically been excluded during times of global transformation due to the long-lasting impacts of colonization and stereotypical thinking in the rest of the world. During past industrial revolutions, African nations were often exploited for labor or natural resources, helping Western countries develop at the expense of their own progress.  Many sociologists now consider the world to be undergoing a fourth industrial revolution, led by the widespread adoption of the internet and movement to renewable energy sources. Blockchain, cryptocurrencies and other distributed ledger technologies will undoubtedly play a role in this revolution.  Read More: FTX Boosts Global Presence With AZA Finance Link in Africa  Africa will not only participate in such a transformational period but also help lead it. The latest evolutionary step in crypto, Web 3, needs Africa with its willingness to adopt new technologies and huge populations needing better financial services, to succeed – not the reverse.  A need for crypto  Crypto’s popularity in Africa is not surprising when you consider the financial infrastructure and currency stability issues. Even the continent’s strongest currencies, like the South African rand, are among the world’s most undervalued. Crypto offers a more stable way to store and send money.  This story is similar to that of African financial infrastructure. When global banks in the SWIFT network – the global messaging platform that banks use to send and receive information securely – began to reassess and sometimes end their relationships with regional banks in emerging markets, a process known as de-risking, the cost and friction of accessing international financial services skyrocketed across Africa.  Due to Africa’s underdeveloped financial transaction and settlement infrastructure (keeping in mind that it is the negative Western stereotypes about the continent and its currencies that are partially to blame), sending money is difficult, time-consuming and expensive. Crypto, which can be sent almost instantly using a mobile phone, helps overcome these obstacles and offers a way for Africans to send money to their families, participate in e-commerce and grow their business opportunities.  A 2020 Chainalysis report noted crypto’s usefulness for remittances on the continent, something reflected in the high percentage of “retail-sized” (less than $10,000 in value) transfers made in crypto in Africa. The same report noted a high flow of crypto transactions between Africa and East Asia, likely due to a more efficient way to conduct business payments for African businesses operating in the region as well as the large number of Asian workers in Africa that send funds to their families.  Africa is ready to embrace the decentralized, cross-border potential of crypto. But is the crypto world ready to acknowledge and support Africa’s potential power?  Africa becoming a powerhouse of Web 3 and crypto adoption going forward is a logical progression. Part of the reason Africa hasn’t yet been able to benefit fully from crypto technologies is due to antiquated, counterproductive mindsets from the heads of international corporations, financial institutions and other global organizations.  Unfortunately, these leaders overlook Africa’s enormous capacity to adopt new technologies, grow its economy and overcome historically rooted obstacles. Instead, the world, including the crypto industry, should look confidently at Africa as a source for innovation and success.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Elizabeth Rossiello,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/25/web-3-needs-africa-not-the-other-way-around,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab4be7c755987ebc9e088a00bc4c8db37b5a67d0-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
