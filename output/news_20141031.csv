42395314,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaHLn,1414793502,Mining Roundup: BTC Guild For Sale and ZeusMiner's Sudden Hardware Halt,"The global cryptocurrency mining sector continues to see new developments that will define its evolution in the months and years ahead. In this ongoing maturation, players both new and old are jockeying for a leadership position.  However, this week brings new indications that not all are adapting easily to this reality.  BTC Guild warns of possible closure  Mining pool operator BTC Guild has announced that it will likely shut its doors early next year, and that a potential sale is being considered at this time.  According to the 31st October announcement, new registrations have been suspended, while the pool's mining servers will be active until 30th November. Thereafter, users need to withdraw any remaining balances by 11:59 PM PST on 30th January.  BTC Guild said that the combined security risks and regulatory uncertainties arising from its presence in the US posed significant long-term challenges. BTC Guild first suggested the possibility that it may close in July, when the operator said in a message to users that future pressures could result in such an outcome.  The pool, which currently constitutes 5% of the bitcoin network hashrate, cited the costs of a successful hack attack which would both imperil the platform and financially impair the pool’s customers.  Owner eleuthria, who also posted a farewell message on the Bitcoin Talk forum, said that more updates will be provided if the pool is closed.  Eleuthria thanked both the pool’s long-time supporters and the bitcoin community for their support, adding:  “Bitcoin and BTC Guild have both radically changed my life. While I am closing BTC Guild, I still plan to remain a part of the Bitcoin community. I do believe, even in the face of over-regulation, that bitcoin will continue to grow and become more useful and usable.”  ZeusMiner halts hardware development  ZeusMiner  has made several significant moves in the past month that suggest the company is shifting its business model as it seeks to compete in China’s mining sector.  Most notably, ZeusMiner is halting development of its third-generation Scrypt ASIC chips and Volcano mining product. The company cited concerns that it would not be able to afford supporting both chip development and the management of its cloud services, ZeusHash.  This move follows ZeusMiner's new partnerships with China-based mining hardware makers and developers ROCKMINER, ASICMiner and XBTec.  Earlier this month, ROCKMINER announced that it would enter a strategic alliance with ZeusMiner, with ROCKMINER contributing SHA-256 hashing power to ZeusHash.  CoinDesk caught up with ROCKMINER’s Alex Lam at Hashers United in Las Vegas, who at the time attributed the deal to a long-standing spirit of cooperation that had developed between the two companies. He explained that the ROCKMINER team is always looking for new ways to grow the marketplace, and that the company itself has also forged partnerships with ASICMiner on similar initiatives in the past few weeks.  “We try new opportunities, new chances,” Lam added.  Both ASICMiner and XBTec will provide logistical support by supplying the hashing power for ZeusHash customers. According to the company, the move represents a broader collaborative shift among China’s largest mining hardware players.  ZeusMiner said at the time:  “The partnership among ZeusHash, AsicMiner and XBTec is a new step forward for the industry and will pave the way for a more thriving ZeusHash cloud mining platform.”  The decision to halt production of the Volcano, CEO Terry Li said in a new email to customers who pre-ordered the mining product, reflects the company’s new emphasis on the cloud. Li said that broad interest in ZeusMiner’s cloud services and consultation with a third-party analyst raised concerns about operating both hardware and cloud solutions long term.  Li explained in the email:  “The analysts estimated that the moment we would allow the switch from Volcano to ZeusHash over 80% of the Volcano pre-order customers would take advantage of this possibility. But this would mean for us that it would be impossible to continue the production of the Volcano because of the low production volume.”  ZeusMiner is offering pre-order customers two options: complete refunds in the currency they made their pre-order in (either bitcoin, litecoin or US dollars) or a pre-order transfer from hardware to software. The company is giving 10% discounts to those who opt for the cloud option, among other incentives.  Li called the move “a very difficult decision” and apologized to affected customers, who he invited to reach out to him with questions and concerns.  “I apologize to you for having to make this decision and thank you for your support,” he said.  KnCMiner refutes class action lawsuit  Sweden-based bitcoin mining company KnCMiner has hit back at allegations that it is guilty of fraudulent behavior.  In a blog post from last week, the company reiterated its opposition to a potential class action lawsuit being organized by a California law firm. KnCMiner, which previously stated that the possible legal effort was lacking a legal basis, said that such efforts are fueled by lies being circulated in both social media and online publications.  The company said:  “We'd also like to add caution stemming from reports of phishing sites and so-called 'ambulance chasers' looking for prepaid retainers using our brand while claiming some sort of 'legal' action – this is also being repeated in some online media outlets. These sites are sometimes paid for by the competition, sometimes supported by paid editorial content and forum posts with made-up legal claims.""  KnCMiner added: “We are not commenting on each and every rumor as we choose to focus our time on producing and delivering the most efficient cryptocurrency products on the market.”  The blog post also included a warning to customers about a phishing attempt being made using fraudulent email addresses. The company advised customers to not disclose personal information before verifying that they are speaking with a legitimate KnCMiner representative.  Miners share data center ‘unboxing’  It goes without saying that many bitcoin miners are tinkerers who love nothing more than experimenting with some new hardware.  A thread on Bitcoin Talkhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=766998.40 posted by the operators of MegaMine, a UK-based bitcoin mine, gained traction after those involved with the initiative shared some photographs of their latest shipment of products. In this case, the team received a batch of KnCMiner Neptunes and quickly got to work on setting up the racks of miners.  The thread sparked a conversation about the economics of running home equipment vs buying cloud mining services, with some recent activity stirred by the simultaneous decline in the price of bitcoin alongside the every-climbing difficulty.  Some members argued that cloud mining can offer ROI while others pointed out that pool fees and market volatility, particularly in scrypt mining, can hurt smaller investors.

42426145,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHph,1414791217,Spanish Hotel Chain Kicks Off Bitcoin ATM Launch With Cocktail Party,"A Spanish hotel chain that accepts payment in bitcoin celebrated the launch of a bitcoin ATM in one of its Madrid hotels last night.  One Shot Hotels  hosted a cocktail party at its Recoletos 04 venue, which was attended by more than 100 people.  ""It was packed. All the Spanish Bitcoin startups were there, along with a lot of bitcoin users and also a few newbies who had a lot of questions to ask,"" trader Félix Moreno said.  The ATM installed in the hotel is a two-way Robocoin machine, which enables users to both buy and sell bitcoins.  While the official launch was yesterday, the machine has actually been up and running since 2nd October. Enrique de Solís Tello, partner at One Shot Hotels, said the ATM has processed more than $5,000 in transactions since it was installed.  Taking the leap  Solís Tello said he started to think about accepting payment in bitcoin and installing an ATM after speaking to some bitcoiners in Madrid and having a conversation with Antonio Luis Garcia, CEO of Bitcoin Spain, the bitcoin ATM's operator. He added:  ""Seeing companies like Dell, Expedia and Wikipedia integrate bitcoin payments convinced me to accept bitcoin in my hotels. We have to take some risk if we want to be a step ahead of our competitors.""  One Shot Hotels has been accepting bitcoin payments directly, using the services of BitPay, since 1st October, but customers have been able to pay for their stays in the hotel in bitcoin through intermediaries, such as Destinia and Expedia, for around five months.  New hotels owned by the brand are set to open in London, Barcelona, Seville and Valencia next year, and they will all accept payment in bitcoin, too.  Moreno, who was a volunteer at the Calle Bitcoin event this month that aimed to increase awareness of bitcoin, said it was great to see so many people at the party last night.  He believes bitcoin ATMs are extremely important in increasing awareness of cryptocurrency as they ""give bitcoin a lot of visibility"" and work in a way most non-bitcoiners are already very familiar with.  Increasing popularity  At a recent event in Madrid, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that his company had garnered 9,000 new customers in Spain within a month of its launch.  There is an, albeit small, appetite for bitcoin in Spain, with more than 50 bricks-and-mortar stores in Madrid that accept payment in bitcoin and over 200 across the country, according to online bitcoin merchant directory CoinMap.  Moreno said interest in bitcoin in Spain is ""growing fast"", estimating 40,000 people currently use the digital currency there. He is hopeful this will increase to 100,000 by this time next year.  ""The number of users has doubled in the past year. We are still a very small community, but hopefully the next doubling will happen in less than six months,"" he concluded.

42426132,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHRh,1414782956,Australian Government May Soon Auction $9 Million in Silk Road Bitcoins,"The bitcoin community could soon see another high-profile auction of bitcoins confiscated from users of the now-defunct online black market Silk Road.  Australian law enforcement officials are now in possession of 24,500 bitcoins (worth $9.4m at press time) following the conviction of their original owner, 32-year-old Warrandyte native Richard Pollard. Pollard was given an 11-year prison sentence today after pleading guilty to commercial drug trafficking, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.  Judge Paul Lacava told Pollard at the sentencing:  ""The system of drug trafficking you engaged in meant you operated an effective one-stop shop where a variety of drugs could be purchased online.""  Following the decision, Pollard’s bitcoins are subject to a restraining order and a 28-day appeal period. Should the funds be forfeited to law enforcement officials as expected, the bitcoins will then be sold at auction by the Victoria Department of Justice.  The potential sale is notable given that the size of the bitcoin stash seized is comparable to the one seized by the US government in its shut down of Silk Road.  The nearly 30,000 BTC remaining in accounts on the site were ultimately sold in an auction held by the US Marshals Service this summer, though it did not include the 144,000 BTC confiscated from its alleged operator, Ross Ulbricht.  Silk Road connection  Authorities originally began monitoring Pollard in 2012, eventually obtaining a search warrant for two of his properties. There, police found mailing materials that were being used to transport drugs to Pollard's customers on Silk Road.  Police estimate that Pollard trafficked 2.8 kilograms of MDMA, 44 grams of cocaine and 30 grams of ketamine as well as a host of other illegal substances from August to December 2012, using multiple post office boxes to conceal the volume of his illicit activities.  The search of Pollard’s properties revealed $58,000 in cash as well as three electronic wallets containing the 24,518 BTC. The funds were later formally confiscated in 2013.  Media event likely  Should the latest Silk Road auction garner similar attention in Australia, the local bitcoin community may be able to expect the technology to obtain more visibility as a result of the sale process.  The US Marshals auction saw venture capitalist Tim Draper purchase the entirety of the holdings, but was still widely considered a boon for bitcoin’s publicity in the US market and coincided with a surge in the price of bitcoin.  The auction was also cited as a boost to bitcoin's credibility, helping dispel rumors that the use of the technology was illegal.

42426143,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHnh,1414778426,"Fidor, Kraken Unite to Launch 'World's First Cryptocurrency Bank'","German Internet direct bank Fidor and digital currency exchange Kraken are teaming up on what the two companies say will be the first “specialized bank for crypocurrencies”.  The platform is expected to enter the first stages of development by the end of this year.  San Francisco-based Kraken reported it will be responsible for the technological aspects of the project, while Fidor will handle regulatory and licensure logistics, drawing from its connections in the broader financial sector.  The partnership builds on an existing cooperation between Fidor and Kraken, which cemented an European market exchange services pact in October 2013. The move to build a cryptocurrency-focused bank echoes previous statements from Fidor’s leadership, including COO Michael Maier who hinted at next-generation digital currency banking services in a June interview with CoinDesk.  Fidor  CEO Matthias Kröner said that ultimately, the goal of the partnership is to create a “marketplace” for digital currency services, which will include mechanisms for trading, payment and currency exchange.  He continued:  “We want to build a regulated and specialized banking home for entrepreneurs and retail customers who are intrigued by the idea and vision of a virtual currency system. But this, we cannot and we will not do on our own.""  Name vote underway  On the project’s official website, visitors are being asked to vote on a name for the proposed cryptocurrency bank. The three names are: BICONDO, BYSE Bank and Cryptocurrency Bank.  According to the website, a workshop scheduled for 15th–16th December will focus on the results of the vote. The workshop, to be held in Fidor's Munich headquarters, is now open for registration.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell noted that he would like to see a more open environment emerge as a result of the partnership in which regulators and digital currency stakeholders can work together.  “We hope that in opening up our relationship and expanding our circle of trust, we'll see the industry grow, regulators become more comfortable and other banks thaw out,” he said.  Door open for partners  Though many details surrounding the project remain unclear, the two companies are already actively seeking additional partners from the banking and technology sectors.  Any prospective partners should be “accepting of regulatory rules, restrictions” related to know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) statutes and equipped with sufficient funding and institutional knowledge to actively contribute to the project.  Kröner said that the banking industry has an interest in supporting the project, adding:  “It should be in the interest of all of us to create a network which is as wide as possible. All partners will be shareholders of this platform, which also means that we will only kick it off with a sufficient group of partners and shareholders.""  Representatives for Kraken and Fidor were unavailable for comment at press time.

42426135,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHXh,1414772753,What New FinCEN Guidance Means for US Bitcoin Companies,"Faisal Khan is a payments consultant and digital money evangelist. He is the co-host of Around the Coin, a weekly podcast on banking, money and payments. He is also a frequent contributor to popular Q&A site Quora.  On October 27, 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) released new guidance for custodial bitcoin exchanges and payment processors, ruling that such companies may be considered money services businesses under US law.  The few days since then have been very hectic. Besides fielding calls from lots of people, everyone is asking the same question. What can a bitcoin company, operating in the US, now do to get back to business?  In the points below, I look at the most important issues facing bitcoin companies under the guidance and consider the options.  Are you affected by the ruling?  One of the first questions you have to ask yourself is, are you affected by the recent ruling? You may need to seek a legal opinion (or two, or three) and be quite certain about the direction the opinion leans towards. There will be two options:  The ruling applies to you, get licensed  The ruling does not apply to you  Do not rely on a single legal opinion, no matter how good he/she/they may be. At the risk of being blunt, it is times like these that law firms and attorneys juice their clients. Get a second and third opinion.  Does the ruling affect your current operations/plans?  Are you yet to go live or are you live? If you’re yet to go live, you have your fair share of work carved out for you. If you were live and engaged in commercial transactions, the ruling could mean problems for you. You may need to stop commercial transactions all together.  This can be devastating for some. If you have a large payroll to deal with, or monthly recurring is high, you may want to consider shedding the excess weight off until you get licensed.  Can you move operations overseas?  For some businesses, the option to move operations (or business) overseas and be able to continue, might just be possible. Just don’t expect to pick up transactions/clients from the US that easily.  How long does licensing take?  The answer is not so simple. On average, the 50 states will take you between one to three years. For a few states you might be able to secure licenses in three to five months, but then again, how many of your clients are walking about in Utah or North Dakota?  States like Illinois, New Jersey, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, etc. hover between six to 10 months. Heavyweights like Texas, New York and California, easily a year to 18 months (if not more). For example, if California does view your application and finds out your audit has expired and requests a new one, that can easily extend the time.  For New York, you will have to get the 'BitLicense' when it comes out. California might offer its own BitLicense equivalent. Texas so far has no plans – or do they? One cannot be sure. They don’t advertise much. Everyone is playing the ‘wait and see’ game with how New York’s Department of Financial Services handles things.  Those who have applied for licenses, will testify that the process is brutal and frustrating at times – one that requires money and patience (in that order), and a little good luck.  What problems can one face?  No action by the regulator weeks after you submitted your application. Added delays. Audit report not acceptable. No commissioner to sign-off your application. Associate to go through your application not awarded. Missing information, please refile again. Missing fingerprints, please refile. Application being returned, please go through checklist as attached again (a lot of elements are not correct or missing).  Shampoo. Rinse. Repeat.  Then there are the highly important surety bond providers. Surety bond companies that the state regulators can work with is a small bunch – about 16 or so in total. You have to deal with their appointed agents, who then provide surety bonding to you. Because you are bitcoin, they may or may not decide to do business with you. If they all deny you (a very, very strong possibility) then you’re as good as dead.  Many states will not take any other form of a surety bond (like a certificate of deposit, cash, etc.) They all work in collusion. I have no fear in citing this. You’ll find out. There are some agents whom you should avoid like the plague, but then again, you will experience this yourselves.  Audits (security audits, financial audits) are a pain and cost a lot of money. Some will be outright rejected after the audit is done. Why? Because the person who conducted the audit is on the regulator’s s*** list. But they won’t tell you so. They’ll just re-word it and let you know that you need to find another auditor to work with.  Banking is also going to be one of your biggest woes. You’ll be hard pressed to find a bank that will work with you once they find out you are a licensed money transmitter. Even the bank accounts you have can be closed without warning. In fact, banking is one of the biggest challenges after licensing.  The pain points are many. Be prepared. Don’t say I didn’t tell you so.  How much money?  Plan on having lots of it. The whole licensing experience is all about spending a lot of money. Lawyers. Net Worth. Permissible Investments. Surety bonding. Insurance. Audits. Auditor fees. Specialists fees, etc.  If you have to raise this money, it will be difficult. Raising the necessary finance itself will add to the time period.  Can I become an authorized agent of an existing money transmitter license holder?  Sure you can. Theoretically this is possible. Practically, the value of a money transmitter license just went through the roof after the FinCEN ruling.  A couple of years ago, you would work with the like of Obopay (now it’s pretty much dead). PreCash isn’t doing anything in the bitcoin space. InComm will only make you an agent if you are promoting their products and that too is a sketchy ‘if’. Meracord won’t touch bitcoins. Large forex or money transfer companies that have money transmitter licenses will just not work with bitcoin companies.  You would be hard-pressed to find money transmitters in this space. One name I can provide that you can talk to is Megan Burton’s CoinX. She has licenses in 30-plus states for money transmission related to bitcoin.  Can I work with a nationwide chartered bank by OCC?  Sure you can. A nationally chartered bank by the OCC is exempt from money transmitter licenses, but then again, how many banks do you think would like to work with bitcoin-related companies?  If you find one. Hide it. Its a keeper. Don’t let anyone know.  The road to licensing is not easy. A few companies like CoinX had the vision to go and get licenses earlier on. Others were very sure of themselves based on the previous FinCEN ruling. Needless to say, the way things are right now, it seems clear the federal government has paved the way for states to declare you as money transmitters, and would not want you to pursue that path as well.  Its going to be tough. You will feel like giving up. You might just go broke. But don’t give up. There is light at the end of the tunnel.

42426142,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHjh,1414765203,W3C's Web Payments Redesign Could Bypass Bitcoin,"UPDATE (21:00 BST 4th November): Updated with additional comment from W3C's Stéphane Boyera.      Like innovators in the bitcoin space, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is seeking to solve e-commerce's persistent problems of high friction and fraud rates through its new Web Payments Interest Group, announced on 15th October.  Proponents of digital currency have been enthusiastic about the launch, expressing optimism that the non-profit dedicated to establishing consensus for open web standards – founded by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee – would embrace an innovation that itself has been heralded as the Internet of money.  Expectations aside, project lead Stéphane Boyera told CoinDesk that while W3C is open to considering how bitcoin and block-chain technology could play a role in these discussions, it sees bitcoin as just one part of the broader online payments overhaul it is seeking to achieve.  Boyera asserted that the W3C is concerned first and foremost with making payments easier for merchants and consumers today, and that means taking a unified approach that brings together all existing payments stakeholders from the traditional banking and finance industry to digital currency payment systems such as bitcoin or Ripple.  Drawing on conclusions reached at the group's preliminary meeting this March, he said:  ""One of the first things we identified was not trying to change the way payments are done today, but just focusing on the connection between existing payment systems and web applications.""  Boyera said that members of the digital currency industry, including Ripple Labs, had been present at the March meeting, but that the event mainly served as a way to gather the various parties involved in online payments. All agreed there had previously been no good forum they could use to communicate about what is a prevalent issue.  Web payments vision  W3C head of marketing and communications Ian Jacobs told CoinDesk that the goal for W3C will be to standardize APIs for different transactions within web applications and web pages, adding that W3C is currently engaged in a number of similar projects with similarly ambitious goals for expanding the web.  ""There's an automotive group that's out there looking at how to bring applications into the automobile,"" he said. ""That group is trying to figure out the common set of things that developers will need to have access to so they can design an API that works on any car.""  The idea in establishing a common API for payments, he explained, is that wallet developers, for example, would only have to write an API once. With a common standard, this API would then be useful everywhere – whether a user was accessing it on a watch or a desktop.  ""A website owner can put something up on a web page with confidence that, whatever payment solutions they have available to them, whether its credit card or PayPal or whatever, it will just work. The sites won't have to provide 12 options and users won't have to do 12 things,"" he explained.  More specifically, Jacobs said that the core topics that will be addressed are increasing interoperability and security around digital wallets, and identifying and authenticating those who are making payments.  ""There is no standard way for increasing trust between the web applications, the user and the wallet,"" he said.  A place for bitcoin  Throughout the interview, Boyera sought to frame how W3C will approach web payments, noting the range of topics that he expects to be discussed in future meetings.  W3C will likely seek a middle path, he said, one that doesn't seek to change the way web payments are done radically or simply create a more interoperable wallet system. Although the way forward through these extremes isn't yet clear, he expects micropayments, peer-to-peer payments and cryptocurrencies to be a part of the conversation.  [post-quote]  Boyera cautioned that, as of now however, the use of bitcoin or blockchain technology is likely to be limited. Rather, he expects the group to focus on bitcoin only as a payment method, perhaps its most common use case to date.  ""You can easily have one place where [users] can add multiple ways to pay including cryptocurrencies, if a given merchant supports this, that will easily allow them to use these mechanisms,"" he said. ""So, that's, for now, how we see our contribution to this area.""  Boyera later clarified that the W3C Web Payments group is not chartered to explore standardization in the area of cryptocurrencies, and that as such, it will not work on with cryptocurrencies as a technology. He added that the group will do the same for all payment technologies, using ACH and inter-bank money transmission as examples.  Notably, both Boyera and Jacobs admitted they are not very familiar with cryptocurrency, viewing themselves as web technologists, though they acknowledged that members of the Web Payments Interest Group are more well-versed.  Call for community involvement  Boyera was careful not to suggest that the group will come to any one decision, emphasizing that it has only recently launched. W3c hopes to end work on the program by September 2017, though he said this is not the target date for any decision.  ""We are planning to publish a detailed roadmap early Q1 2015, and then start developing corresponding technologies,"" he said.  This timeline, he suggested, means there's still time for the bitcoin industry to help influence the direction of the body and its goals. ""The place of cryptocurrency at the group depends on who will come to the group,"" he added.  Both businesses and individuals interested in joining the group can follow developments on mailing lists, reviewing and commenting on published work. This includes commenting on documents the group will issue every three months and contributing to discussion in the Web Payments Community Group, Boyera said.  Members and invited experts may, in turn, form task forces to tackle separate topics. All the group's proceedings will be public, as well.  Ultimately, it's these participants who will have the most say in the group's direction, Boyera said.  ""Depending on who joins the work, the group can have a big focus on more traditional payment systems or it could have a focus on new payment systems,"" Boyera said. ""We have been talking with companies like Ripple Labs, and they might help the group focus on new ways of paying.""  The overall adoption of bitcoin will also, he said, influence outcome.  ""If there is a critical mass of people that can bring an expertise around cryptocurrencies and they can help solve some of the issues, then this is surely something that will be taken up by the group,"" he stated, adding that a presence from the finance industry could lead to different results.  He concluded:  ""If, on the contrary, you have mostly the traditional finance industry, banks and networks, then the focus will be to improve credit card payment on the web.""

Data from bitcoin exchange LakeBTC will be suspended from inclusion in CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index from 3:00pm GMT today. This is an hour earlier than the original time of 4:00pm GMT.  The move is a result of faulty price ticker data sent by the exchange this morning, 31st October, which supplied bid and ask values of $0 at 07:18 and 08:01 (GMT).  This is the third instance of faulty price data from LakeBTC this week. Two earlier instances of faulty data caused the price to spike for several hours on 26th October and for seven minutes the following day.  LakeBTC claimed that it had fixed the data errors on 29th October.  Data under review  The exchange said today's $0 bid and ask values were the result of an attempt to fix its earlier data fault. Its price ticker reports a null value when the bid-ask spread is ""out of range"", according to LakeBTC.  In this case, a negative spread was created when the bid value was greater than the ask value temporarily because of an order placed on the exchange, the exchange has added. The negative spread caused the ticker to report null values in those instances, LakeBTC said.  In light of the repeated price reporting errors from LakeBTC, the exchange will be suspended from inclusion in the CoinDesk BPI for 30 days.  CoinDesk will continue to collect LakeBTC price data and review it for errors over the 30-day suspension period, and will also begin a process of reviewing solutions to prevent similar problems from arising in future.

42426139,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHdh,1414754164,Bitcoin Foundation's New Head Patrick Murck Outlines Future Plans,"The Bitcoin Foundation's new executive director Patrick Murck has outlined his priorities for the organization's ""new direction"" and its relationship with stakeholders.  His statement follows yesterday's resignation of former executive director Jon Matonis both from the post and his position on foundation's board.  Notably, former general counsel Murck acknowledged a need to repair the foundation's relationship with the bitcoin community, even if that meant sometimes adopting unpopular or controversial positions on some issues, and taking risks with communication and transparency to demonstrate honest engagement.  He wrote:  ""That means we may not always say exactly the right thing and we might not always be on message, but we will be authentic in how we interact with the community in the future and I hope that you all get to know the people who work hard to make the foundation go.""  There will be an 'ask me anything' (AMA) session for the new executive director on Reddit on 5th November, at which the community is invited to join in with their own questions about the foundation's future role.  Murck stated his first priority is to ""cut out distractions"" to better serve the bitcoin cause, which means a sharp focus on standardization through the bitcoin core reference implementation and doing more to support those building the bitcoin infrastructure.  Additionally he promised to run the non-profit foundation more like a business – finding new ways to generate funding, rather than simply relying on membership dues and hopes of bitcoin price appreciation.  Future plans  Murck indicated he will continue the foundation's lobbying efforts with policymakers, defending the community's ""right to open innovation and participation"" and working with other recently formed bitcoin policy-focused groups.  On the software front, he expressed admiration for open protocols against centralized and proprietary systems, saying they would always win in the marketplace and attract more talent.  Murck thanked his outgoing predecessor for his work, saying he looked forward to seeing Matonis' contributions to bitcoin in future.  Some of the Bitcoin Foundation's future role is already in evidence with its drive to expand internationally. An official campaign to sign international affiliate groups has produced at least 10 chapters outside the US, and one foundation board seat is now reserved for an international representative.  Experience and education  Patrick Murck, an attorney, graduated from the Catholic University of America's Columbus School of Law in 2006, and has since worked for law firm Fletcher, Heald & Hildreth and a number of companies in the technology and virtual economy spheres, including Engage Legal, Engage Strategy, and bitcoin startup CoinLab.  As the Bitcoin Foundation's general counsel, Murck met with representatives from several US government agencies in 2013 to discuss first steps towards appropriate regulation of digital currencies.  He also helped produce an official response to the earlier cease-and-desist letter sent to the foundation by California's Department of Financial Institutions (DFI), and last November testified before the US Senate during its landmark hearings into the legitimacy and challenges of digital currencies.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/31/bitcoin-foundations-new-head-patrick-murck-outlines-future-plans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c03a510e0d4db92e0cd39c548c364c04e6940c8e-1500x1071.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
