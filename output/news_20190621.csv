42382201,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qpOP,1561160878,Bitcoin Price Tops $10K for First Time Since 2018,"Bitcoin’s price soared above $10,000 on cryptocurrency exchanges for the first time in 15 months. The price hopped the $10K barrier at 7:35pm Eastern Time.  At press time, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $$10,080.49 – the highest level since March 8, 2018 – representing month-to-date gains in excess of 13 percent, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. On a 24-hour basis, BTC is outshining most top 10 cryptocurrencies with 7 percent gains.  The price rise is backed by a 12 percent jump in trading volumes. As per data source CoinMarketCap, $21 billion worth of bitcoins have traded across cryptocurrency exchanges in the last 24 hours. Messari, however, is reporting the “Real 10” volume at $1.4 billion.  With the move above $10,000, bitcoin has erased more than 40 percent of the sell-off seen in twelve months to December 2018. Further, prices look set to end the second quarter with triple-digit gains. As of writing, BTC is up more than 130 percent on a quarter-to-date basis.  Halving on the horizon  Looking forward, BTC may continue to shine bright as the cryptocurrency is set to undergo mining reward halving sometime in May 2020.  The process designed to curb inflation by reducing the reward for mining on bitcoin’s blockchain is repeated every four years and leads to supply deficit.  The upcoming reward halving may leave a bigger supply deficit if Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra ends up boosting bitcoin’s appeal and adoption rate as predicted by some observers.  On Tuesday, the social media giant launched the white paper to mixed reviews with pundits it a net positive development for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.  While bitcoin's long-term prospects look bright, the cryptocurrency may see a pullback in the short-term. After all, prices have rallied more than 140 percent in the last 2.5-months and bulls usually take a breather following such stellar gains.

42382184,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qp5X,1561154403,'Don't Hold Your Breath:' Australia's Central Bank Chief Bearish On Libra,"The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Chief, Philip Lowe, declared himself to be profoundly skeptical on the impact of Facebook's new cryptocurrency.  The goal of Libra as a massively adopted digital currency might look good on paper for some, but the regulator doesn't see it as much of a possibility in the short run.  ""There’s a lot of water under the bridge before Facebook’s proposal becomes something we’re using all the time,” Lowe said.  In declarations given during a press conference, Lowe commented that Libra's outcome is still uncertain. The digital currency proposal is yet to comply with regulatory standards, which is the main concern among regulators at an international scale.  “There are a lot of regulatory issues that need to be addressed and they’ve got to make sure there’s a solid business case,"" Lowe said.  The social media platform announcement has already sparked a chain of reactions this week, with distrust being commonplace from regulators and developers alike.  The RBA's Chief extended his reticence to the use of cryptocurrencies in general, arguing that cryptocurrencies ""would not take off"" in Australia since the population is already used to digital payments controlled by banks.  “We already have a very, very efficient electronic payments system that allows anyone of us to make bank payments to another person in five seconds just knowing their mobile phone number,” Lowe said.  Libra's Overview  On the same note, the RBA also published its views on the future of cryptocurrencies in Australia. Unsurprisingly, its conclusions are not very far from its main representative opinions.  According to the institution, centralized digital payment methods leave no room for massive adoption of cryptocurrencies, stating that the use of this form of money requires a control that many are against.  ""Many projects generally come at the cost of making a cryptocurrency more centralized, a feature that may not be attractive to crypto-libertarians and in any case makes them more similar to established payment systems,"" the RBA said.

42382182,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qp4H,1561150816,Where to Find Bitcoin's Rising Stars,"Thirteen coders and academics gathered this week at Chaincode Labs in New York City for the bitcoin protocol residency program, in what organizers say is the most intensive and diverse cohort to date.  It would be hard to overstate how impactful this quiet program is, as one of the few resources for independent developers in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Members of the program’s prior three cohorts went on to create the lightning browser extension Joule as well as the nonprofit educational resource Bitcoin Optech. Matt Corallo, an alum of the 2016 residency, authored notable efficiency improvements such as FIBRE and the rust-lightning implementation, which makes it easier for users to build and interact with layers of the bitcoin network.  “Having diverse funding sources for bitcoin protocol development is essential to maintain decentralization,” said Alex Morcos, co-founder of Chaincode Labs, which funds the program. “The good news is that more organizations fund open-source developers than ever before, including the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, Blockstream, DG Labs, Square, Xapo and others.”  According to the residency organizer, Adam Jonas, this year’s 12-week program is the longest session to date. Out of 216 applicants from 39 countries, this fourth class will include eight developers completing the entire program. The other five participants, including a few academics who don’t write code, were only able to attend for roughly three weeks of seminars. The second portion of the residency, after these seminars, is focused on supporting residents as they build independent, shippable projects.  A significant portion of the program’s reading materials and presentations will also be shared online through sites like GitHub, so that anyone can use them for studying at home.  ""It's by far the longest [program] we've ever done,” Jonas said. ""The whole idea is we'd like to make this residency available to people regardless of their circumstances. … We've just made sure that their costs are covered.""  These stipends and flexible requirements, tailored to each participant’s needs, allowed people like lightning developer Jamal James to attend. As an entrepreneur and father of three, taking a whole summer off wouldn’t have been feasible. Yet he plans to apply learnings from the Chaincode seminars to his ongoing contributions to open source projects.  “Many are learning on their own little by little, like myself. This residency expedites the ramp-up process substantially,” James told CoinDesk. “Many other companies use the bitcoin network for profit but do not contribute to its development progress.”  Rising stars  There’s no better place to look for up-and-coming bitcoin innovators than the kitchen of Chaincode Labs.  Unlike many other crypto companies, there are no pool tables, bean bags, or motivational posters about the moon. It’s a simple, sunny office in midtown Manhattan where a handful of developers discuss bitcoin and then write code.  “It is a privilege to learn with and from one another,” resident Amiti Uttarwar told CoinDesk.  As a fresh-faced Coinbase engineer with just a few years of experience, Uttarwar offers a prime example of an applicant who gained entry to the program with a combination of grit and eagerness. So far, she’s taught herself about bitcoin by contributing to the Bitcoin Core GitHub in her spare time.  “I'm very content to do things like seeing through abandoned [pull requests],” she told CoinDesk. “It's something that I can help contribute and learn a lot from.""  Uttarwar will be completing the whole summer program and submitting a final project. Speaking about the program’s open source ethos, focused on support rather than instruction, she said:  ""No one is telling me what to work on. That's my question to answer and people here are supportive. They discuss what they think are valuable problems to solve, but at the end of the day it's my own passion that I am here to follow and they're creating space to encourage that.""

42382197,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qpKd,1561143626,NY Senate Confirms Acting Superintendent of NYDFS,"The New York State Senate has confirmed Linda Lacewell as new superintendent for the Department of Financial Services, the body responsible for regulating nearly 1,500 financial institutions with assets of more than $2.6 trillion and the cryptocurrency industry.  Lacewell was nominated for the position by Governor Andrew Cuomo and previously served as chief of staff for the Governor and acting superintendent for the DFS. She had been serving in the role as the state's top financial regulator since February 2019.  Since 2015, the DFS has taken the lead nationally to regulate the virtual currency market. The agency’s central aims in regulating the industry are to prevent money laundering, protect consumers, and lay out rules related to cybersecurity. The department has approved 19 crypto companies since introducing BitLicense requirements in June 2015.  Under Lacewell’s leadership as acting superintendent the DFS has continued to expand the virtual currency market in New York by offering licenses for new entrants.  Most recently, Lacewell granted the application of Bitstamp USA, an Luxembourg-based exchange, to hang its shingle in New York.  “A regulated industry protects customers while supporting innovation and ensuring our financial services sector is a vibrant part of New York’s economy,"" Lacewell said at the time. She suggested the expansion of the market encourages competition.  Additionally, the department has made moves to secure the trading of privacy-protecting cryptocurrency, when granting the Gemini exchange a BitLicense to offer trading in Zcash.  However, the regulator’s requirements are anything but lax. In April, Bittrex was denied a BitLicense for failing to comply with KYC rules and shirking its “obligation to conduct appropriate due diligence on all types of assets,” as Shirin Emami, executive deputy superintendent for banking at the DFS, said in a CoinDesk op-ed.  “It is an honor and a privilege to be confirmed as Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services,” Superintendent Lacewell said in a statement. “I thank Governor Cuomo and the Members of the New York State Senate for the opportunity to lead this essential agency and I look forward to working with the entire Legislature at a time when it has never been more important to protect consumers, safeguard markets, enforce the law and encourage real financial services innovation.”  Lacewell previously established the Cyber Division, which focuses on consumer protection and cybersecurity, and the Consumer Protection and Financial Enforcement Division, to fight consumer fraud as well as ensure compliance from regulated firms.  “Linda understands what good public policy is and intuitively knows that markets work best when there’s an even playing field with clear rules preventing fraud, abuse and unfairness,” said Benjamin Lawsky, the agency’s first superintendent, at the time she was first announced acting principle.

A show cause hearing will follow next week, and Wright may be held in contempt of court at either the civil or criminal level.  Velve Freedman of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP the firm representing plaintiff Ira Kleiman tweeted:  Florida judge Bruce Reinhart had ordered Craig Wright, who claims to have invented the bitcoin software, to disclose his bitcoin addresses in an ongoing lawsuit filed by the estate of his former business partner, David Kleiman.  Ira Kleiman, Dave’s brother, on behalf of the Kleiman estate accused the Australian entrepreneur of scheming to seize a shared holding of bitcoin the two mined together between 2009 and 2011, as well as Kleiman’s intellectual property. The plaintiff seeks the return of half of a 1.1 million bitcoin stockpile, allegedly held in the “Tulip Trust,” which Wright claimed consolidated bitcoin he mined and purchased between 2009 and 2011.  According to a court declaration filed on May 8, Wright said seven trustees were named, including Craig Wright, David Kleiman, and Ms. Uyen Nguyen — whom Wright claimed he has had no contact with since 2016. Wright has also said in the past, “Access to the encrypted file that contains the public addresses and their associated private keys to the Bitcoin that I mined, requires myself and combination of trustees reference in Tulip Trust I to unlock based on Shamir scheme.”  In the declaration, Wright also pointed to the existence of bitcoin mined under his direction at by staff at HighSecured and Signia Enterprises. Wright said this stockpile is also inaccessible.  The existence of a previously unknown second Tulip Trust – to which Equater Consultants is named a trustee – also come to light in the court document.  It is unknown how the Federal court has ascertained the existence of bitcoin holdings not previously disclosed by Wright. A transcript of a hearing held on June 11 before Judge Reinhart is under seal, along with the bitcoin listings Wright has provided.  Stephen Palley, a lawyer who has followed the case closely but does not represent either party, said, “This is a huge pressure point in settlement negotiations which may or may not be happening.”  Negotiations between the parties reached an impasse at a mediation session held on June 18.  Neither Freedman or Palley responded to a request for comment. As it stands Wright will appear for a deposition on June 28, at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

These are the first two code changes to be officially approved for the Istanbul upgrade, which is tentatively targeted to activate on ethereum mainnet in October.  In today's bi-weekly call  , developers discussed which of the nearly 30 EIPs for Istanbul would be approved and which would be rejected or delayed for a later system-wide upgrade, also called a hard fork.  While the majority of EIPs still do require further discussion, two are now officially approved.  EIP 2024 and EIP 1702  EIP 2024  – or, in some documents, EIP 131 – adds a new precompile to the ethereum virtual machine. Precompiles are normally expensive operations on the ethereum blockchain that deploy for a fixed fee or ""gas cost.""  EIP 2024 introduces a precompile for a new hash function called “Blake2.” The function is said to be faster in verifying and authenticating blockchain data than other more traditional hash functions on ethereum such as SHA-3.  Various strands of Blake2 are currently being used by other cryptocurrency projects such as privacy coin zcash and domain-name platform Handshake. EIP 2024 introduces a precompile for a version of Blake2 called ""Blake2B.""  ""Blake2B means that we could interop with zcash on the ethereum main network,” said James Hancock, one of the three authors behind EIP 2024. “Wrapped ZEC within ethereum, [shielded] transactions, a whole lot of cool stuff.”  EIP 1702, on the other hand, authored by Parity Technologies developer Wei Tang, is geared towards smoother smart contract upgradability.  At present, decentralized applications (dapps) that run on the ethereum blockchain are based upon virtually immutable, self-executing lines of code known as smart contracts.  These smart contracts are compiled and executed through the ethereum virtual machine, said to be the very heart of the blockchain network, that functions as the engine deploying the many thousands of dapps created by developers.  The current ethereum virtual machine is expected to be upgraded in the long-term to WebAssembly code, which offers developers greater flexibility when it comes to programming language and performance.  EIP 1702 suggests introducing a new methodology for hard forks called ""account versioning"" so that upgrading the ethereum virtual machine or introducing new virtual machines in the network can be easier.  Tang explains in his proposal:  ""By allowing account versioning, we can execute different virtual machine for contracts created at different times. This allows breaking features to be implemented while making sure existing contracts work as expected.""  Ethereum is currently the second largest blockchain in the world by market capitalization with over 20,000 daily active users, according to crypto analytics site State of the DApps.

42382193,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qpFb,1561132813,"All Global Crypto Exchanges Must Now Share Customer Data, FATF Rules","A powerful intergovernmental organization devoted to combating money laundering and terrorism financing has finalized its recommendations on regulating cryptocurrencies for its 37 member countries.  As expected, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards released Friday include a controversial requirement that ""virtual asset service providers"" (VASPs), including crypto exchanges, pass information about their customers to one another when transferring funds between firms.  The final recommendation makes official the contentious part of FATF’s February proposal, saying countries should make sure that when crypto businesses send money, they:  ""... obtain and hold required and accurate originator [sender] information and required beneficiary [receipient] information and submit the information to beneficiary institutions ... if any. Further, countries should ensure that beneficiary institutions ... obtain and hold required (not necessarily accurate) originator information and required and accurate beneficiary information ...""  Under the new guidance, the required information for each transfer includes:  (i) originator’s name (i.e., the sending customer);  (ii) originator’s account number where such an account is used to process the transaction (e.g., the VA wallet);  (iii) originator’s physical (geographical) address, or national identity number, or customer identification number (i.e., not a transaction number) that uniquely identifies the originator to the ordering institution, or date and place of birth;  (iv) beneficiary’s name; and  (v) beneficiary account number where such an account is used to process the transaction (e.g., the VA wallet).    Calling the ""threat of criminal and terrorist misuse of virtual assets"" a ""serious and urgent"" issue, FATF said in a public statement that it will give countries 12 months to adopt the guidelines, with a review set for June 2020.  The so-called travel rule is a longstanding requirement for international banks when sending each other money on customers' behalf. But blockchain industry advocates argued it would be onerous if not impossible to put into practice with crypto, harmful to user privacy, and counter-productive to law enforcement goals.  Enforcement recommendations  The guidelines also suggest that individuals using crypto wallets to transmit value could be designated VASPs, and thus subject to licensing requirements – at least if they do so as a business.  ""In cases where the VASP is a natural person, it should be required to be licensed or registered in the jurisdiction where its place of business is located—the determination of which may include several factors for consideration by countries,"" the document says.  Individuals are not VASPs if they use crypto to buy goods or services or if they make ""a one-off exchange or transfer,"" FATF said.  FATF is also giving countries the option of requiring foreign VASPs that provide products or services within their jurisdiction to register with the appropriate authorities.  ""Competent authorities should take the necessary legal or regulatory measures to prevent criminals or their associates from holding, or being the beneficial owner of, a significant or controlling interest, or holding a management function in, a VASP,"" the guidance states elsewhere.  ""Such measures should include requiring VASPs to seek authorities’ prior approval for substantive changes in shareholders, business operations, and structures,"" it adds.  For enforcement purposes, FATF recommends that countries consider using open-source information and web-scraping tools to identify unregistered or unlicensed operations advertising their services. Authorities should also consider public feedback, information from reporting institutions and ""non-publically available information,"" such as intelligence or law enforcement reports.  The guidance even addresses services designed to obfuscate the origin of crypto transfers, saying nations should make sure that providers can either manage or mitigate the risks of transfers that use mixers, tumblers or similar tools. ""If the VASP cannot manage and mitigate the risks posed by engaging in such activities, then the VASP should not be permitted to engage in such activities,"" the document reads.  VASPs should also be able to freeze or prohibit transactions with sanctioned individuals, FATF said.  Short-term impact?  Data analytics company Chainalysis, among others, has warned that instead of more transparency, the now-official rule would spur services to shut down or drop off the radar.  But despite hearing such concerns at a private-sector consultation meeting in Vienna last month, which drew 300 attendees, the FATF, led by the United States, pressed ahead.  ""By adopting the standards and guidelines agreed to this week, the FATF will make sure that virtual asset service providers do not operate in the dark shadows,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in remarks to the FATF plenary session held Friday in Orlando, Florida.  This will help the fintech sector ""stay one step ahead of rogue regimes and sympathizers of illicit causes,"" he said, adding:  ""We will not allow cryptocurrency to become the equivalent of secret numbered accounts [and] we will allow for proper use, but we will not tolerate the continued use for illicit activities.""  To be clear: FATF's recommendations for anti-money-laundering policies are not binding; member countries adopt them by passing legislation or writing regulations. However, countries that fall egregiously out of compliance with FATF standards get put on a blacklist, making them radioactive to foreign investment.  The crypto guidelines come a week ahead of the annual Group of 20 (G20) summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 28-29. The G20, comprised of 19 countries and the European Union, has been pushing for international harmonization of crypto regulations.  The guidelines also come just before the United States' one-year presidency of the FATF ends on June 30. Marshall Billingslea, the U.S. Treasury official who holds the rotating post, had listed applying FATF standards to virtual currency among his top priorities.  UPDATE (June 21, 20:30 UTC): Details were added to the passage about designating certain individuals as VASPs.

The job description gives few specifics and no mention of its relation to the Libra project.  ""This individual will be a key part of the Finance Project Management Organization and will be responsible for planning, leading and executing on global, cross-functional finance projects,"" the description says. Facebook did not respond to questions by press time.  Facebook's career website now has 26 blockchain-related job openings, who would join the former staffers of the blockchain startup Chainspace whom Facebook hired earlier this year.  The finance program manager position requires more than eight years of project management experience and some experience with blockchain tech. Responsibilities include planning, leading and executing projects in collaboration with other teams globally, developing business cases, ensuring sponsorship and getting stakeholders on board with those initiatives' goals.  The program manager would also develop effective communication with clients and shareholders, determine business roles and resources needed for projects, analyze potential risks and ensure the projects' compliance with tax laws, the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations.  Facebook made waves this week publishing the details of its plan for a global currency with the support of such companies as Uber, Lyft, PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard. The impact for the crypto industry could be huge, some experts are predicting, bringing massive public attention to the space.  However, some crypto professionals are concerned that Libra would give Facebook and its partners enormous control over users' financial data.

His eponymous Wanxiang Innova City, in progress since 2015, will convert 8.3 square kilometers premium riverfront real-estate in Hangzhou into an “expansive digital and ecological urban space,” according to a press release.  PlatON blockchain tech will be deployed to “track, transfer, and secure critical data such as resident identification cards and smart devices.”  In addition to the $29 billion Wanxiang has already pledged to invest over the decade-long development, it will also incorporate its intellectual property to research renewable energies and build manufacturing facilities for electric vehicles.  To this end, PlatON’s blockchain will also be used to monitor driving behavior to train auto-driving systems and monitor the electric vehicle life cycles, according to Vincent Wang, Chief Innovation Officer at Wanxiang Holdings. Granular data including battery life will be collected to better manage ecological waste.  “Imagine a smart transit system that tracks and rewards responsible driving behavior, or a renewable power grid that incentivizes energy generation and trading, or even a myriad of urban services that can be validated, built, and offered at ease without the constraints of rigid data silos,” said Wang.  The full view of PlatON’s computing network includes tracking corporations and individuals’ use of public infrastructure in Wanxiang Smart City, to enable seamless transactions and transparent use of services.  PlatON CSO Ada Xiao said the blockchain “can ensure the privacy of sensitive data including digital identities of residents, smart equipment, and personal devices, as they interact with one another on a shared ledger.”  Some 90,000 people in total are expected to move in by 2025.  The Wanxiang Blockchain Lab was established as the first not-for-profit organization in China dedicated to blockchain research and development. The smart city will also feature an International Research and Innovation Park. China has been using high-tech tools to track citizens in real time, including millions of Muslims.

Vanuatu routinely faces a high risk of tsunamis, cyclones and volcanic eruptions, while poverty is high, with around 40 percent of the population getting by on less than $4 a day, according to a World Bank report from last year citing 2010 data.  In the pilot, named the UnBlocked Cash, 200 residents in the villages of Pango and Mele Maat on the island of Efate were given tap-and-pay cards, each loaded with about 4,000 vatu ($50) in DAI, according to Micky. The cards could be used for payments across a network of local stores and schools, with 32 vendors in total.  The vendors, in turn, were provided with Android smartphones with an app allowing them to accept such payments, being able to redeem DAI for fiat currency via Sempo or at other crypto exchanges if they so choose.  Sempo co-founder Nick Williams told Micky:  ""As far as we know this is the first time an NGO has used a stablecoin to provide aid anywhere. This is not a one-off pilot. We believe that using a stablecoin to allow the unbanked to access finance will completely change the way aid runs.""  Faster aid  Oxfam has previously distributed help to Vanuatu villagers using cash, but the time taken for ID checks and bank visits was an obstacle, the charity representative said. Onboarding a new user for cash aid took around an hour, signing up for a DAI card takes six minutes, Micky wrote. Plus, it made the whole process more transparent.  ""Both donors and NGOs struggle with transparency and the way aid money is used,"" Sandra Hart, the Unblocked Cash lead at Oxfam, told the publication. Using a stablecoin brings in end-to-end transparency ""ensuring that the people who receive funds are the ones that need it,"" she said.  Last year, Sempo conducted a series of similar fund transfer tests in Beirut and Akkar in Lebanon, Iraqi Kurdistan and Athens, distributing DAI and a custom ethereum ERC-20 token. The trials showed that the blockchain tech doesn't change the main patterns for the use of humanitarian aid and doesn't really help preventing fraud, but serves instead ""as a way to maximize the likelihood that honest systems remain honest,"" Sempo wrote in a blog post.  Blockchain tech has increasingly been garnering the attention of the international charity bodies. For example, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) last year reported the successful use of the tech for distributing aid to the Syrian refugees in a refugee camp in Jordan.  The project, named Building Blocks, helped reaching 106,000 refugees in Jordan every month, saving WFP around $40,000 a month in transfer fees, the WFP’s director of innovation and change Robert Opp said last September. He told CoinDesk the organization is going to utilize the tech also for tracking food deliveries in East Africa and in a educational program for Syrian refugee women in Jordan.

42382181,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qp31,1561122021,G7 Forming Task Force in Response to Facebook's Libra Cryptocurrency,"With the recent unveiling of Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency raising regulatory questions, France is forming a task force within the Group of Seven (G7) nations to examine the issues.  Reuters reports Friday, that the governor of the French central bank, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, indicated the crypto task force would be headed by European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure and would look at how cryptocurrencies are regulated to avoid money laundering and other problems.  The move had likely been on the cards, with France's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, on Tuesday expressing concerns that Libra might grow to replace traditional currencies, and calling for the G7 central bank governors to prepare a report on Facebook’s project for their July meeting.  “It is out of question’’ that Libra be allowed “become a sovereign currency,” Le Maire said at the time. “It can’t and it must not happen.”  In today's comments, Villeroy said France aims to be ""open to innovation"" but firm on regulation.  Facebook for the first time provided concrete details of the Libra project on June 18, publishing a white paper and indicating that it has set up a subsidiary, Calibra, and an independent consortium, Libra Association, to develop and govern the cryptocurrency.  Libra will be a stablecoin pegged to a basket of fiat currencies and government-backed securities, and is initially to be used as a means to transfer money across the globe. Ultimately, an ecosystem of financial services is planned.  Villeroy also said the concept of a stablecoin still needs to be defined for regulators.  Since the unveiling, other regulators, including in the U.S. and the U.K. have also spoken of potential regulatory issues around Libra.  The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs will hold a hearing on July 16 regarding Libra.  German European Parliament member Markus Ferber also called for scrutiny, saying companies ""must not be allowed to operate in a regulatory nirvana when introducing virtual currencies.""  The G7 is a group of the wealthiest advanced economies as defined by the IMF. It currently includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. France currently holds the rolling presidency of the group.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has erased 40 percent of the sell-off seen in the twelve months to December 2018 and looks set to rise above $10,000.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose above $9,740 on Bitstamp earlier today, retracing more than 40 percent of the drop from the record high of $19,666 reached in December 2017 to the low of $3,122 hit in December 2018. The global average price, as calculated by CoinMarketCap, is just $150 away from achieving that milestone.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,840 on Bitstamp – the highest level since May 2018 – representing 31 percent gains from lows near $7,500 seen on June 10.  It is worth noting that bitcoin's latest leg higher is a accompanied by a rally in gold prices. The yellow metal has risen from 1,320 to $1,411 over the last ten days.  The positive correlation between the two assets contradicts the divergent price action seen in the preceding seven months.  For instance, BTC fell from $6,200 to levels near $3,100 in four weeks to December 14, 2018. During the same time period, gold went from $1,200 to $1,300 and further extended the rally to $1,346 (Feb. 20 high). By early May, the yellow metal was down 6 percent from February highs, while bitcoin was up 76 percent from December lows.  The change from negative correlation to positive correlation, if sustained, could boost bitcoin’s appeal as digital gold. Many including the likes of Tyler Winklevoss, founder of Winklevoss Capital Management, already consider bitcoin as gold 2.0.  It remains to be seen if the two assets continue to move in the same direction in the near future. That said, technical charts indicate bitcoin is likely to extend its ongoing bullish run to levels above $10,000.  Weekly chart  Bitcoin’s convincing move above the widely tracked 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement hurdle of $9,442 has strengthened the bullish case put forward by the higher lows, higher highs pattern, ascending 5- and 10- week moving averages and Chaikin money flow index, which is currently reporting strongest buying pressure in six months with a reading of 0.35.  As a result, the cryptocurrency looks set to test the next major resistance range marked by the April 2018 high of $9,949 and the psychological resistance of $10,000.  A high-volume weekly close above $10,000 would expose the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement resistance of $11,394.  It is worth noting that the cryptocurrency is up nearly 140 percent on a quarter-to-date basis (from April 1’s opening price). The bulls usually take a breather following such stellar rallies.  So, a sudden correction cannot be ruled out. That said, the outlook would turn bearish only if the price violates the bullish higher lows pattern with a move below $7,500.

42382195,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qpI7,1561118409,At-Home Crypto Miner Coinmine Now Pays Out Bitcoin,"Coinmine, a cryptocurrency mining device aimed at the hobbyist market, will now give its users the option to be paid in bitcoin.  The device was able to mine monero, zcash, grin and ethereum at launch, a set of cryptocurrencies that had a low enough difficulty threshold to allow for the average miner to see a minimal return. The addition of bitcoin payouts gives miners more incentive to try the $799 ($699 with a special BTC discount) product.  ""To get you the most bitcoin possible from your Coinmine One, we had to engineer MineOS to automatically mine whatever crypto converts to bitcoin at the highest rate and then exchange it to Bitcoin for you and put it in your wallet,"" said founder Farbood Nivi. ""This way you're getting way more Bitcoin than if the device was mining Bitcoin directly. ""  The Coinmine box won't make you a millionaire overnight. Nivi sees it as a testbed and experimental tool for those who want to dip a toe into the mining process. Given the resource requirements of high-stakes mining, however, the Coinmine offers users a less energy-intensive option.  ""At today’s numbers, your Coinmine One will generate about $15-20/month of bitcoin in USD prices,"" said Nivi. ""Of course, that number changes based on the future value of Bitcoin. If the value of Bitcoin appreciates, so will the value of what you made with your Coinmine One.""  Nivi also sees the product as a cheaper and faster way to take part in networks like Lightning.  ""The time to build and maintain a comparable device with mining and a Bitcoin Lighting Node is about $400 if your time is worth $20/hour and it takes you 20 hours to research and build the hardware and software,"" he said. ""The parts for a miner and a Bitcoin Lightning Node could cost you $500 easily. That's $900, and you still would have to control your DIY device from a command line with a monitor and keyboard instead of an app you can just tap on.""  Coinmine is rolling out the BTC update today and users will be able to mine and even ""put their crypto to work,"" said Nivi.  ""We’re also partnering with services like Compound Finance, Cred, and Blockfi so you can put your crypto to work and earn a return on the crypto that your Coinmine makes. We call it Compound Mining. All of this is possible because of MineOS,"" he said.

The firm – the world's biggest manufacturer of crypto mining devices – plans to lodge documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in July, according to the sources.  Last September, Bitmain filed to IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), however that effort looked to have met resistance and ultimately the firm let its filing lapse in March.  According to one of Bloomberg's sources, Bitmain may be reducing its previous fundraising target to roughly $300 million–$500 million in the U.S. offering, although that figure is not yet set in stone. It had hoped to raise up to $3 billion via the HKEX share offering.  Bloomberg adds that the preparations for the U.S. IPO are still in the early stages and are subject to change.

According to a press release emailed to CoinDesk, the new NEM Studios is being created by NEM Holdings, the non-profit holding company of NEM Ventures, and the NEM Foundation to help with strategy and backend development for NEM's planned ""Catapult"" protocol upgrade.  Catapult is aimed to provide enterprises with a ""high speed, configurable and scalable blockchain solution,"" the release states.  NEM Studios' development activities are to be funded by NEM Core, and is now seeking to hire a CTO and a development team to assist with building the Catapult Core protocol and API layer. Chair and trustee of NEM Holdings and chair of the investment committee for NEM Ventures David Shaw – who also advises the Catapult project– will lead NEM Studios as director.  A steering committee comprised of David Shaw, NEM Foundation President Alexandra Tinsman, and Nate D’Amico from NEM's Project Management Committee will lead the ""go-to-market"" strategy for the upgrade.  Shaw said:  “We are thrilled to be creating a dedicated team to bring Catapult to life this year and support its development into the future. We will be looking to recruit the best in the business, with deep technology experience, and look forward to creating a more effective and scalable ecosystem for our community.”  Catapult is planned to become the core NEM code supporting both private and public blockchains. As per the press release, it will include smart contract plug-ins allowing a range of capabilities such as digital asset creation, decentralized swaps, advanced account systems and business logic modeling.  The news comes soon the NEM Foundation was forced to make major staffing cutbacks following a shortfall in its finances. Tinsman confirmed in March that the foundation had laid off about 100 people – a mix of consultants and full-time staffers – over a period of a month.

According to a release from the Financial Services Agency (FSA), on Feb. 13, the agency visited Fisco – a Japanese investment firm that took over ownership of the hacked Zaif exchange in April and found that the firm had made a number of ""legal violations.""  The FSA said it found ""problems"" with the firm's business management – for example, the board of directors had not been discussing ""important management issues such as business plans."" Risk management at Fisco, relating to potential issues like money laundering and financing of terrorism, was also found to be lacking, as did other aspects of general business management, such as its outsourcing process.  The FSA said ""management did not recognize the importance of legal compliance.""  To bring the company back in line with its expectations, the agency has handed Fisco a business improvement order, mandating it to establish a system to allow proper internal management, outsourcing, accounting and auditing. The firm must also set up risk management systems for fiat and cryptocurrency.  In its September 2018 hack, Zaif lost approximately 7 billion yen ($62.5 million) in bitcoin (BTC), monacoin (MONA) and bitcoin cash (BCH).  A month later, Fisco announced its intention to take over the ailing firm and finally completed the acquisition in April, at which point normal services were resumed for the first time since the hack.

42382167,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qnLL,1561104040,Meet Alternateth: A 'Friendly Fork' of the Ethereum Blockchain,"One ethereum community member is about to begin what one might call a ""friendly fork"" of the ethereum blockchain.  Called “Alternateth,” James Hancock, project team lead at ethereum startup ETHSignals, told CoinDesk in interview that he hopes the network will act as “a sister chain” to ethereum validating ideas and proof-of-concepts before adoption on the main chain. The goal is to initiate the split in two months' time.  “For ethereum to be sound money, it needs to be very conservative in making changes,” said Hancock. “For ethereum to keep pace with competition it needs to keep making changes. These two ideas are in tension as it is difficult to do both well.”  Ethereum is the world's second largest blockchain network by market capitalization. Since launch in 2015, ethereum has witnessed the rise of several other competing smart contract platforms include EOS, Tron, IOST and others. While none come close to matching ethereum's near $30 billion valuation, the proliferation of new technology iterating on ethereum's architecture and structure have fueled further pressure on developers to maintain the network's competitive edge.  As such, Hancock sees Alternateth as a test network of sorts for speeding up development on ethereum mainnet. For example, one of the first features he intends to execute on Alternateth is mining algorithm switch, “Progressive Proof-of-Work” (ProgPoW), which has yet to see mainnet activation on ethereum despite being approved by core developers since early January.  But outside of testing purposes, Hancock also sees Alternateth as a blockchain to support ethereum developers.  Leveraging a block rewards mechanism similar to what is seen on the zcash blockchain, Hancock tells CoinDesk that a portion of mining rewards on Alternateth will be collected into a multi-signature address “comprised of multiple trusted community members.”  At present, Hancock is rallying support for this new ethereum blockchain from other developers. In terms of miner support, Hancock purports that some general purpose miners on ethereum are already “ready to mine” the ProgPoW algorithm, which Alternateth will leverage from the outset.  In terms of project fundraising, Hancock emphasized that there is presently no intentions to launch an initial coin offering or pursue alternative avenues for funding.  Rather, Hancock affirmed the project is an entirely volunteer-driven effort that has yet to fully work through all of the nitty gritty details of blockchain code protocol and monetary policy.  The overall vision, however, is clear. Hancock affirmed:  “It will be a test-bed for some of these upcoming features [for ethereum] and will support funding development for the main chain...Similar to the relationship between litecoin and bitcoin.”  Early stages  For now, the Alternateth initiative is still in very early stages of development, though Hancock asserts he’s receiving support privately for now from other unnamed ethereum developers and miners.  “I am getting support on how to execute the fork,” said Hancock. “I wouldn't say they are ‘working on the project,’ at least not for now...I’ll let the [developers] announce their own involvement.”  To this, ethereum developers and other community stakeholders have been rallying support for various sustainable funding initiatives on the ethereum blockchain.  In fact, the proposal of introducing block rewards on the platform most recently stirred a flurry of controversy in the ethereum community back in April when a working group was created by the founder of crypto bounties platform Gitcoin, Kevin Owocki.  Owocki told CoinDesk in a past interview:  ""I do think that there's a limit to the amount of throughput that can go through Consensys grants and the [Ethereum Foundation] grants system...Also, in the spirit of decentralization, we basically can't rely on Consensys grants and [Ethereum Foundation] grants to be around forever.”  Past conflicts  Agreeing with this sentiment, ethereum core developer Lane Rettig created a GitHub proposal in response for “a better, more explicit governance structure” on ethereum which could take on the task of managing block reward funds.  However, the conversation came to a head when discussions got heated between members of the block rewards working group in April.  Arguing that ""public salary discussions"" would be one of the many political issues caused by reallocating Ethereum Foundation funds into a new structure of fund management, Spankchain CEO Ameen Soleimani called out Rettig for allegedly requesting a $200,000 salary from the Ethereum Foundation and pushing discussions on block rewards forward for his own personal financial gain.  Rettig rebutted this accusation by stating that he did not request such a salary and that the Ethereum Foundation as a whole “does not give salaries.” Hourly pay by the Ethereum Foundation according to Rettig, on the other hand, is “as little as $25 per hour” for senior developers.  Rettig wrote in the working group Telegram group chat:  “My motivations for these governance/funding discussions is that I worked unpaid for about six months and there are other developers on the Ethereum Foundation teams that have been unpaid for ten months or more, many working without valid contracts. Does that sound fair?”  While Rettig and Soleimani have since returned to amicable relations on social media, the block reward working group – now renamed to ""ETH Commons Funding Models"" on Telegram – has since quieted down considerably.  At the same time, Hancock, who remains one of the working group members on Telegram, hopes to revive this idea of block rewards, only by applying it to a separate blockchain platform.  Alternateth, Hancock concludes, will be “a friendly fork of ethereum” designed to support and complement the ethereum blockchain, not compete with it.

42382177,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qnU9,1561091476,Examining Facebook's Claim Its Crypto Is for the Unbanked,"Daniel Evans is part of the team that started the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX), which is now open for security token listings. Opinions are his own.      The excitement about Libra is premature. Maybe Zuck’s got more to share, but right now there’s very little information, and Libra has a lot to prove. Libra’s main stated mission is to service the world’s poor and unbanked. This seems unlikely to be the whole story…  Facebook’s source for the 1.7 billion figure is the World Bank’s Global Findex Database 2017. Findex also believes that 1 billion of these have mobile phones and 500 million have internet access.  However, Findex also says that over half of the 1.7 billion come from just seven countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria and Pakistan.  More than half of these are in places where:  Cryptocurrencies are banned  Facebook can’t freely operate  The country is under heavy FATF restrictions (due to money-laundering and anti-crime concerns)  Or, it faces other limitations.  Targeting these unbanked just doesn’t seem plausible. How are they going to get in and get people to use it? Who and how many people are realistically going to join? How fast does Libra realistically expect adoption to be and is it worth it?  These jurisdictional limitations also help to explain why Libra doesn’t have any local partners anywhere with a relevant market presence or customer base. Out of the 28 founder members of the Libra Association, only one, Mercado, is based in a developing part of the world (South America). None are based in Africa or Asia where most of the world’s unbanked actually are.  Libra expects to have 100 members by 2020. Perhaps some of them will be in places, with networks, and local ground presence and knowledge, to actually roll it out. Then again, the Breakthrough Initiative, a founding member with Zuckerberg on the board, says its main mission is searching for alien life, so Libra already has outer space covered I guess…  About the details  Stable currency plans also need further explanation.  The countries left where it can access the unbanked sometimes have significant currency swings. The proposal is to make Libra very stable by backing it with a basket of yet undecided fiat currencies hoped to have ""low volatility.""  OK.  Well, the definition of volatility and its adjunct risk is tied to the asset/liability profile of the user. In any economy it’s a better idea that your earnings and debts should be in same currency. There are numerous cases of developing economies taking on debt in or relying on foreign currencies and it ending in disaster.  Never mind developing economies, just look at southern Europe and the northern dominated euro. Libra risks inflicting this sort of mess on the people it wants to help and who need this problem even less than comparably richer Europeans.  It doesn’t work for countries to rely on foreign currencies. For individuals or small businesses with wages and expenses in local fiat…this looks suicidal.  Libra may have good intentions. It needs to answer why this isn’t just a rich country solution being pushed on poor country problems. It’s like when well-meaning philanthropists donate solar panels without engineers to maintain them, or livestock which are ill-suited to the local climate, or irrigation pumps where there is no power grid.  The stakes are obviously much higher if a new currency is implemented and it goes wrong.  What about Asia?  Facebook also have some questions to answer about China.  China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is sprawling. China has signed cooperation documents with 126 countries and 29 international organizations, many in the places where Facebook might hope to service.  Many large projects are already underway with Chinese cooperation. Ports, railways, highways, power stations, aviation, telecommunications and finance. It seems very unlikely that China wouldn’t also want to target the unbanked in these countries and extend its technological and financial influence.  Is Facebook prepared to go up against China? That’s after it’s done looking domestically at anti-trust monopoly cases, objections from regulators, the Federal Reserve and Congress, and internationally at places like the Bank of England or the French Finance Ministry.  On the other hand, China has long been a big center for bitcoin miners, cryptocurrency trade and was a major centre of the ICO craze in 2017.  It seems highly unlikely that similar-profile Chinese companies to Facebook have not already considered this idea and run some numbers. They are reportedly not following Facebook any time soon.  Has someone like Jack Ma figured it’s perfectly fine selling things to unbanked Chinese in the existing way? Is a new system and having to educate people on a new cryptocurrency not worth the hassle? For now, big Chinese technology companies seem happy to stick with conventional payment networks, don’t want a blockchain solution, and don’t want to try a battle with the Chinese treasury.  And that brings things to the final thought.  Just Poke Me  Facebook got big by giving away free social media and selling targeted advertising mostly in G7 countries.  This works when the targets have money to buy things. What is targeting the subset of 1.7 billion unbanked actually worth? What do they buy that is worth advertising? How is Libra actually intending to make any money?  What is the point of Libra? Skeptics and general grumpies might say it’s one of these:  Publicity stunt. Maybe Facebook wants to divert attention away from accusations of grubby deeds like privacy violations, political manipulation, and censorship, and toward a lofty and socially pleasing enterprise? Maybe Facebook wants to recover its image from 10 years ago when it was still cool, new, and energetic?  Search for new revenue. Maybe Facebook is trying to make up for its decreasing, aging user base?  Financial data. Maybe this is a longer-term Trojan Horse or a test-bed for Facebook’s future?  Crush competition before it gets started. Maybe Facebook is getting spooked by the growing numbers of smaller social media and messaging platforms which are crypto ready, like Minds, Kik or Telegram, which threaten to keep sapping Facebook’s and WhatApp’s user bases and threaten their standing?  'Are we alone?' Maybe Breakthrough Initiatives has finally fulfilled its goal of finding alien life, specifically Zuck’s own extra-terrestrial race? They’re all unbanked, with no accounts at JPMorgan, and a prime new untapped demographic perfect for Libra.  Zuck the Benevolent. Believers and optimists may well say that maybe Zuck’s interested in technological progress, believes he can do a good job, and likes new challenges etc. Sure, why not?  This piece truly isn’t about making any judgement on any of the guesses above or any other plans for Libra. Not much has really been announced and it’s too early to assess.  However, a dispassionate, fact-based and common-sense analysis shows Libra is likely not anything to do with servicing the 1.7 billion poor and unbanked in developing countries.  Maybe the unbanked are a lot richer than we realize or will be soon. Maybe Libra has made more progress than we realize in getting the right governmental permission to access crypto-hostile and generally difficult countries. At the moment this just looks either poorly planned or there are other, smarter things to come. It just isn’t credible that this is about servicing the unbanked.

Monero (XMR) and Binance Coin (BNB) are the only two in the green within the top 20 at CoinMarketCap and are both posting 4 percent growth over a 24-hour period.  What’s more, the total market capitalization has risen to a high of $292.1 billion its highest point since July 31, 2018 while the market capitalization for altcoins remains relatively unchanged, down $100 million, so it would appear BTC remains king and the altcoins will have to await their season a little longer.  Eyes are now firmly set on bitcoin’s new target at $9,650 resistance, last seen 13 months ago on April 30, 2018, pointing toward a very strong upward move beyond the $10,000 psychological price tag.
