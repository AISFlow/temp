42430645,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwW3h,1560986126,Will Facebook's Libra Be an On-Ramp or Dead End for Crypto?,"Facebook's announcement that it would create a stablecoin on a blockchain means more as a competitive answer to WeChat and Alipay's payment services than it does to the crypto industry, according to AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant.  Ravikant told CoinDesk via email:  ""I don’t think it means much for crypto because it’s not really (sovereign-resistant) crypto.""  The immediate question for the crypto industry following the announcement of Facebook's ambitious Libra project was whether this new token will lead more users into the broader world of cryptocurrency or insulate them from other projects. That is, will someone who becomes a Libra user be more likely to one day hold bitcoin, ether, EOS or other crypto assets?  For his part, Ravikant sees a way Libra could meet a need, noting that it could lower the cost of global payments, but, he added, ""I struggle to see why it needs to be on a blockchain other than for PR / Marketing.""  The Asian consumer payments giants Tencent (parent of WeChat) and Alibaba (parent of Alipay) seem to agree: They say they won't be following Facebook's lead into cryptocurrency development.  That said, most of the industry sounds upbeat following the news that the fifth largest company in the world by market capitalization, Facebook, is leading a slew of financial giants (such as Visa, PayPal and Stripe) into the blockchain universe.  For example, Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, one of the founding members of the Libra Association, wrote on his blog:  ""So as we think about the potential drivers for mainstream crypto adoption, a simple, fully-collateralized, cryptocurrency used inside the world’s largest applications, touching hundreds of millions or billions of consumers, is perhaps the most promising one.""  In fact, others pointed to specific mechanisms by which individuals might find their way into crypto in a world where Libra becomes a common way of transacting value.  ""It's good news for exchanges and good news for crypto because you'll have a lot more vetted users,"" Avivah Litan, an analyst at Gartner, told CoinDesk. She foresaw exchanges as being a major source for attaining Libra in the early days. ""So now when you're signing up for Libra you're going to see more cryptos as well.""  People who already have access to financial services will be motivated to find ways to get crypto in order to get better deals, Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital told CoinDesk.  ""The value prop is clear: discounts through merchant partners like Uber and Lyft and Spotify (and many more to be announced),"" Samani told CoinDesk via email. For the unbanked, it's the chance to use a currency that's potentially more stable than their country's national currency.  Preston Byrne, an attorney at Byrne & Storm and an early entrepreneur in the world of permissioned blockchains, told CoinDesk he foresees Libra being helpful at a high level so long as the network is not built in a walled-off way.  ""As long as it requires people who are hooking into the ecosystem to use things that are otherwise good for cryptocurrency, then it's good for cryptocurrency,"" Byrne said.  Joey Krug, Augur's creator and an investment officer at Pantera Capital – one of the industry's largest crypto investors – pointed to one way the infrastructure has already committed to play nice with the rest of the industry.  ""Libra has stated the underlying network will have pseudonymous addresses just like any other crypto network, which means exchanges can list Libra, effectively making it an on-ramp to all of crypto,"" Krug told CoinDesk.  Byrne did note that Facebook and its partners could use their clout to crowd out other cryptocurrencies, if they wanted to. For her part, Arianna Simpson, founder of Autonomous Partners and a former Facebook employee, does not see an existential threat to bitcoin in Libra.  ""Other cryptocurrencies – Stellar and Ripple come to mind – are much more likely to have their raison d'être called into question,"" she wrote in a note to her limited partners, which was shared with CoinDesk.  In fact, on bitcoin, Samani offered another tantalizing bit of speculation. He argued that with interest rates on sovereign bonds moving so widely into negative territory, the Libra reserve is going to have a hard time finding extremely conservative investments with an upside.  Samani said:  ""I would expect the Libra Association to maintain some of its reserves in permissionless cryptocurrencies like BTC. So that's one path, though it's not confirmed.""  Big does not always win  If Facebook is able to convince the world that crypto works, Libra itself will have to work. And that's no sure thing.  Industry insiders were quick to recall the many headline-grabbing tech products that never caught on.  That said, the general response seems to be excitement about Facebook and its partners potentially educating billions of people about public-private keys, payments without intermediaries and money on the internet.  But there were a lot of notes of caution, particularly about whether or not Facebook could really lead users to use its new blockchain.  Joel Monegro of Placeholder, a prominent New York City-based venture fund, compared it to the earliest iterations of the Microsoft Network, which was basically Microsoft's attempt to create its own proprietary internet.  Monegro told CoinDesk via email:  ""Libra is to Facebook what MSN was to Microsoft. They sense the opportunity, but are missing the point.""  Similarly, CoinFund founder Jake Brukhman rattled off a list of major failures by other tech giants. Though generally optimistic about Libra's potential to benefit the whole market, Brukhman cautioned that ""people also tend to get excited and underestimate how hard it is to launch successful products even as established exceptional companies.""  For example, he mentioned Amazon's Fire Phone. Additionally, Google has had a cascade of failed creations. In social media alone, it failed with Orkut, Buzz, Wave and Google Plus. Apple's self-driving car product was stillborn.  But Albert Wenger, also of Union Square Ventures, wrote on his blog about how critical a wide distribution network has been at key moments of technological expansion. He too drew an example from Microsoft: the introduction of Internet Explorer (IE) to all Windows users in 1995.  IE drove tremendous adoption of the internet. But, as Wenger wrote, ""It is useful to remember that Microsoft was not the primary beneficiary of the web.""  But is it my giant?  The 53 co-authors of ""The Libra Blockchain"" white paper said the blockchain was built to offer ""a new global currency — the Libra coin."" Currencies are money's consumer application, but will be Libra be consumer-friendly?  William Quigley was a co-founder of the company that created tether, the original stablecoin, and he's now the CEO of WAX, a startup organized around digital property rights. He thinks Libra will save people money on almost everything they buy.  ""It's probably 1.5 percent of global GDP is just eaten up in currency conversions,"" Quigley estimated. ""I think that's a big part of what Facebook is looking at.""  Others aren't betting against the world's entrenched financial institutions, however.  As Tyler Cowen, one of the globe's most influential economists, wrote on his blog: ""Have banks ever lost a political battle of this kind?""  If any coalition could uproot those channels, it may be the group of extremely powerful companies Facebook has assembled. But that sheer size could pose another danger to the masses.  ""It comes with the risks of centralized pain points and vulnerabilities,"" ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin told CoinDesk. ""Data silos enable incumbents to maintain pricing power, and also come with the risks of data breaches, privacy, and security issues – problems that many have already begun to associate with Facebook.""  Maya Zehavi, a blockchain consultant and entrepreneur, offered similar concerns. While Facebook theoretically won't control the Libra blockchain, earlier iterations of the company have been known to wreak havoc on startups that build businesses dependent on Facebook platforms. Just ask Zynga.  At this very early date, Zehavi said Libra looks like a ""closed loop.""  ""If you want to make an investment or if you want to run a product today, you need to be able to run a node, a full node,"" she said. ""You need to have the infrastructure in place to be a part of that network."" Plus, there's the cost.  Founding members of the Libra Association have paid $10 million each for the privilege of running a node, though there are plans to ultimately open node membership to anyone. (Founding members also get a return on their investment in the form of interest generated by the Libra reserve's potentially vast pool of coin-backing assets.)  Still, Quigley, the tether creator, thinks the 10 years of crypto history to date should be the main framework for evaluating Facebook's Tuesday announcement. Several people CoinDesk spoke to made some version of his same point:  ""Every time a new cryptocurrency has been created it has been additive to the overall crypto experience.""

42430633,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwVjh,1560985248,Algorand Raises $60 Million in Token Sale,"Algorand raised over $60 million in a token sale of its native Algo token on Coinlist, using a Dutch Auction mechanism that ensures market participants set a uniform price per Algo. All 25 million tokens were sold at a market drive price of $2.40.  Company representatives told CoinDesk, the ""cryptocurrency auction was the first implementation of its transparent, innovative economic model,"" which stresses fairness and inclusivity in an attempt to build a ""Borderless Economy.""  Algorand is where “macroeconomics meets cryptocurrency,"" writes Ninos Mansor of Arrington XRP Capital, in his paper ""The Monetary Experiment: Algorand A Thesis For Algo Currency Markets,"" published June 17.  The auction coincided with the official launch of Algorand's MainNet. The platform handles 1,000 transactions per second with a latency of less than 5 seconds, putting it on par with the throughput of major global payment networks -- such as Visa or Mastercard.  Additionally, as a permissionless, pure proof-of-stake blockchain Algorand offers the “bleeding edge cryptography with a clever economic model,” said Arrington.  This is the first time Algos entered market circulation. It is unclear how many buyers participated in the auction, which was originally scheduled to last for more than five hours, but sold out in under four due to oversubscribed global demand.  ""Algos are being dispersed to wallet right now (for successful bids). Therefore - there are non on exchanges,"" said Keli Callaghan, VP of Marketing at Algorand. Therefore, no market capitalization is available for the firm, though some have speculated it sits around $6 billion. ""Which is still a top 10,"" Callaghan said.  “Our focus in the Algorand ecosystem has been to encourage broad and inclusive participation where global users, not a centralized collection of companies, control the network,"" said Silvio Micali, founder of Algorand in a statement.  The Foundation previously said it will auction off 600 million Algos per year, meaning that this most recent auction of 25 million tokens only represents a portion of the forward float. The total token supply of the Algorand platform is 10 billion Algos.  The recent influx of equity, ""into a system that is decentralized by design,"" is on top of the $66 million the company raised from venture capital firms such as Union Square Ventures and Pillar Venture Capital.  Algorand announced earlier this week that its node repository has been open-sourced and that it has entered into a partnership with Flipside Crypto to provide a free user engagement analytics suite.

The hearing, ""Examining Facebook’s Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations,"" comes in the wake of calls from members of Congress to more closely examine Libra and its potential risks. There have even been calls to halt work on the project until hearings are held.  In light of those comments, a Facebook representative said that “we look forward to responding to lawmakers’ questions as this process moves forward.""  The July 16 meeting will be held at 10 a.m. EST, and as of yet, no information about witnesses has been released. The hearing will be broadcast to the public.  It was the Banking Committee that wrote an open letter to Facebook last month seeking answers about its work on Libra, including how it works and to what extent the social media giant has sought input from regulators and market watchdogs.  As of this week, Facebook hadn't directly responded to that letter, with a representative telling CoinDesk that ""we received the letter and are addressing the senators’ questions.""  After today's hearing news broke, committee member and 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted that ""Facebook has too much power and a terrible track record when it comes to protecting our private information.

Speaking during a press conference that followed a two-day Fed policy meeting, Powell was asked if he or the Fed had any concerns about Libra affecting the central bank's ability to conduct monetary policy, as well as if Facebook met with Fed officials.  ""You know Facebook, I believe, has made quite broad rounds around the world with regulators, supervisors and lots of people to discuss their plans and that certainly includes us,"" he said.  As for potential effects on monetary policymaking, Powell said that ""we're a long way from that,"" going on to note that ""digital currencies are in their infancy.""  ""So essentially...not too concerned about the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of cryptocurrencies or digital currencies,"" he continued.  ""It's something we're looking at,"" said Powell, going on to state:  ""You know, there are potential benefits here, there are also potential risks, particularly of a currency that could, you know, have large application.

Powell also noted that ""we don't have plenary authority over cryptocurrencies"" when asked if the Fed would directly oversee Libra, but he highlighted the Fed's role in international regulatory groups, suggesting that the U.S. central bank would likely have input in any regulations that take shape in the wake of Facebook's Libra debut.

42430640,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwVth,1560969001,Regulators Debate Cryptocurrency Legislation Ahead of G20 Summit,"Cryptocurrency regulation will take a step forward during the upcoming V20 Summit where country representatives will assess the new course of legal action proposed by the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  FATF will release proposals on June 21 in hopes of setting new international standards for crypto businesses.  Legislators support the summit, which will also bring together national blockchain associations and the world’s leading Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).  FATF standards for blockchain and cryptocurrency have set high expectations among legislators. Of special interest is its impact on long-lasting financial security issues, a subject addressed by Japanese Congressman, Naokazu Takemoto.  “The VASP industry recognizes the importance of clear regulation in preventing financial crime and mitigating corruption,” Takemoto said.  The event, which will run parallel to G20 Summit on June 28 and 29 in Osaka, Japan, takes a new dimension by being held at the only country to have a legal framework for cryptocurrencies.  The latest examples given by Japanese regulators include measures to tighten restrictions on speculative trade and new obligations for exchanges, such as keeping a cryptocurrency protection fund.  Regulatory Concerns  While regulators agree on the need to control cryptocurrency businesses, too much regulation could backfire.  According Roger Wilkins, FTAF ex-president and former secretary Australian Department of the Attorney General, a common concern is that new regulations could push the public out of controlled platforms.  “What we are hearing from industry is that the new rules may have the opposite effect to which they were intended, effectively forcing crypto transactions off the controlled platforms, which are currently one of the best avenues we have in gaining visibility over financial crime,” Wilkins said.  Blockchain association representatives from China, South Korea, United Kingdom, Singapore and Australia will also be present at the event to review the new standard. Prior to that, the blockchain industry will know for sure if it will face real oppression from the international body.  In the mean time, legislators agree in the necessity for a balance in order to adapt and take advantage of the upcoming regulations. Nonetheless, is well-known that there's no such thing as flexibility or non-compliance when it comes to following FATF recommendations.  “As a former regulator, I recognise how important it is to identify a balanced solution that implements the recommendations of the FATF while also building the opportunity for business,” Wilkins said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Diana Aguilar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/06/19/regulators-debate-cryptocurrency-legislation-ahead-of-g20-summit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/13dc83e785ba8e7a4f2a6e55f630e4a414d49b21-1024x512.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430646,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwW1h,1560963926,China's Biggest Payment Firms Have No Plans to Follow Facebook into Crypto,"China's internet giants appear unlikely to follow Facebook into the cryptocurrency space anytime soon – though you can be sure they're paying attention.  Pony Ma, the CEO of Tencent, the parent company of social messaging and payments app WeChat, said Wednesday that he thinks regulation will be the deciding factor for the success of Facebook's Libra initiative.  “The technology [of Facebook] is already mature enough so it’s not difficult [to implement]. Now it just depends on whether it can obtain regulatory approval,” Ma wrote on a private discussion on WeChat.  The comment was screen captured and subsequently circulated on the platform. Tencent confirmed its authenticity to CoinDesk.  Tencent did not have further comment on the issue but referred CoinDesk to a remark Ma made in March 2018 about the firm’s stance on cryptocurrency. Ma said at the time:  “The greatness of blockchain technology depends on how it’s used. Issuing initial coin offerings or digital currencies still bear too much risks … Tencent will not issue a coin and does not consider to be involved in that.”  Similarly, Eric Jing, CEO of Ant Financial, the payments affiliate of e-commerce retailer Alibaba, had already declared last year that the firm would stay away from digital currencies with no real value while focusing on the underlying blockchain technology.  ""Our stance on this hasn’t changed,” a spokesperson for the company told CoinDesk Tuesday, hours before Facebook officially unveiled its vision for Libra.  While Ant Financial, which operates AliPay, is expanding to overseas markets, instead of issuing a cryptocurrency, it’s adopting a conventional strategy of partnering with regional payments providers one-by-one to offer services to local users.  No better choice?  The reasons as to why payment giants in China may not consider cryptocurrency useful could go beyond just regulatory issues as the country’s central bank banned cryptocurrency offerings in 2017.  Yan Meng, vice president of the Chinese Software Developer Network (CSDN), who focuses on token economic research for the country’s largest developer community, said Facebook’s fragmented user base across the world leaves it with no better choice but to borrow ideas from blockchain and cryptocurrency in order to avoid a traditional way for launching a global payments network.  “Facebook just can’t do a global payments network via traditional methods, which require applying for a license and preparing foreign exchange reserves with local banking, one market after another,” Meng said.  Such methods may not be even replicable for payments firms in China, he argued, given their users predominantly come from one single economy using one type of fiat currency.  Based on data from the People’s Bank of China, mobile payments volume in the country reached $41.51 trillion in 2018 alone, with Alipay and WeChat Pay accounting for more than 90% of the market. Currently, both firms have expanded payments service in several overseas markets including Japan, South Korea and Singapore.  “The advantage of WeChat and AliPay is they have already gained a significant number of users from just one giant economy that accounts for 20 percent of the world’s population,” Meng said. “China has already had a well-established payments settlement network so there may not be real demand for having a crypto stablecoin now.”  To be sure, Facebook’s services are still inaccessible under normal internet conditions for users based in China. It’s not clear whether or how Libra could be offered to users in the country.  Regulatory concern  Further, Meng wrote in an article published June 16 that Facebook’s long-term ambition could be even looking at becoming a stateless central bank that uses Libra as a base currency.  “With sufficient incentives, nodes of Facebook’s Libra network would represent Facebook to push for utility in various countries for its 2.7 billion users in business, investment, trade and financial services,” he wrote, going as far as arguing “these would help complete a full digital economy empire.”  But the move may not come easy in the views of regulators in different jurisdictions.  Indeed, immediately after Facebook released its Libra cryptocurrency plan, financial regulators in Europe have already voiced concerns over the potential of Facebook running a “shadow bank.”  Meanwhile, a lawmaker who heads the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee in Facebook’s home country has also asked the firm to halt its development on Libra at least for now before hearings can be held.

42430639,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwVrh,1560961842,'I Don’t Trust Facebook With Anything:' The World Reacts to Facebook's Libra,"Although Libra hasn’t yet officially launched, pundits, politicians, and developers are already weighing in with warnings, celebrations, and memes.  US representatives from both sides of the aisle have already chimed in.  “Facebook is already too big and too powerful, and it has used that power to exploit users’ data without protecting their privacy,” Representative Sherrod Brown, the leading Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, tweeted out. “We cannot allow Facebook to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight.”  Maxine Waters, House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman, also expressed concerns. Even asking Facebook to stop the project until Congress can understand it further. She is joined by Republican Senator Patrick McHenry.  Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) told Yahoo Finance it sounds like Facebook is “expanding their monopoly” with its new cryptocurrency project.  “We need to see exactly what their specific proposals are, but I'm very concerned about Facebook's behavior on a range of fronts. I'm concerned about their size, I'm concerned about their anti-competitive conduct, I'm concerned about their rampant violations of privacy,” Hawley said.  He even called for an investigation into breaking up the social media giant.  “There needs to be an antitrust investigation. I hope one will go forward, but in the meantime, in the immediate future with this consent decree — if it's just a fine of a few billion dollars, that's a speeding ticket to Facebook. They need to get serious,” he said. “Name Mark Zuckerberg. Name him, if he has in fact participated in violating consent decree as reports indicate. And let's consider some tougher penalties, too.”  “I don’t trust Facebook with anything,” he said.  “Facebook’s new Libra blockchain project has the potential to be a big step forward towards a more global and inclusive financial infrastructure,” said U.S. Congressman Darren Soto, Co-Chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. “We are encouraged by the possibility of increasing access to mobile and digital payments, which will ultimately benefit our society and become a driver of economic growth. While it is yet unclear how this new technology will be regulated, it is crucial Congress continues to protect consumers and the financial well-being of investors, while simultaneously promoting innovation for these virtual currencies.”  “In the Congressional Blockchain Caucus we are working in a bipartisan manner to educate and maximize Blockchain technologies’ potential for the U.S. economy. We applaud the thoughtfulness behind the Libra Association. If efforts to achieve this multi-level cryptocurrency coordination is successful – one that protects consumers and prioritizes user privacy – this could be a significant advancement for the 21st Century economy,” he said.  Pundits Come In Punching  On the private side of things, pundit Jim Cramer was ecstatic.  “The disenfranchised will welcome Mark Zuckerberg as a savior, ” he said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” He sees it as a solution to the underbanked in American cities where “check cashing places” are the closest consumers can get to money services.  Bankers and startup founders see Libra’s success as inevitable.  “They’re not the first company to launch a crypto payment solution, but they do have immense reach obviously through their Facebook platform,” said NAB's business banking chief Anthony Healy. “With a billion plus users on its platform, it is clearly a threat.”  “If it’s successful, it's not just going to have the traditional qualities of a corporate currency like Westfield dollars or, Qantas Frequent Flyer points, it’s really a governance play,” said Asher Tan, founder of CoinJar.  “Like all fintech disrupters, they’re all potential threats, but they’re also opportunities for us to learn, and if some of these emerge as real threats we can learn from them, develop our own capabilities and respond appropriately.”  Crypto grandfather Erik Vorhees is obviously excited about the move.  “Zoom out for a second and realise how far this industry has come,” he tweeted. “The biggest companies in the world are now launching cryptocurrencies. BOOM.”  Spencer Chen of BRD Wallet, thinks crypto people should stop “shitting” on Libra.  Jerry Brito, executive director over at the research non-profit CoinCenter, raised important questions about the future of Libra:  ""Of course, there must be more to joining the Investment Token club than merely meeting the outlined requirements (seems like Huawei and Gazprombank might qualify), though it’s not clear to me if it’s a majority vote of the membership or what.""  Changpeng Zhao, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, wrote that Facebook has a chance to “reshape the payment industry” and start the “un-dollarisation of the world.”  “Facebook’s initiative, with the Libra cryptocurrency at the center of the project, will have a significant impact on the financial industry and global economies from both a medium and long-term perspective,” he wrote. “Backed by a basket of fiat currency-denominated assets in its initial release, Libra represents a first attempt at creating a world currency, on-chain or not, with everyday usage by billions of individuals and institutions across the globe.”  Librexit  Europe, on the other hand, is calling for far more scrutiny.  ""As a reminder, the principle of e-money in Europe is that a customer credits an e-money account usually from a bank account or a credit card (or more recently from cash-in / cash-out points at partner merchants). This e-money account is opened in the books of an e-money institution and customers can use this e-money to make online payments to merchants who accept it (for example very few today do not accept PayPal). The difference with Facebook's Libra is almost solely that Libra will be indexed to a basket of currencies rather than being representative of a single currency,"" said Emilien Bernard-Alzias of legal firm Simmons & Simmons LLP. ""Therefore, Libra project is not significantly revolutionizing the financial market in Europe and does not really challenge the European Central Bank (ECB). As announced in the Libra’s white paper, this project is much more game changing for people having poor access to banking services over the world.""  ""The proposed launch of a digital coin (cryptocurrency) by Facebook will require careful scrutiny from several enforcement bodies, including data protection authorities,"" said European Data Protection Supervisor Giovanni Buttarelli.  Bruno Le Maire already called upon the Group of Seven central bank governors to prepare a report on Facebook’s project for the upcoming July meetings. Expressing a latent anxiety about the disruption of national currencies for the Euro, he said:  “It is out of question” that Libra “become a sovereign currency... It can’t and it must not happen.”  Markus Ferber, a German member of the European Parliament, was also concerned about Facebook’s supranational spread, adding to the conversation that with more than 2 billion users the tech-giant could become a “shadow bank.”  “Multinational corporations such as Facebook must not be allowed to operate in a regulatory nirvana when introducing virtual currencies,” he said, sounding the alarm for regulators.  ""It is no surprise that Facebook Inc.’s ambitious plan to roll out its own cryptocurrency — Project Libra ran into immediate political opposition in Europe, with calls for tighter regulation of the social-media giant,"" reflected Robin Matze, Blockchain Lawyer and Advisor to the German Government.  ""AML (Anti Money Laundering) laws usually take a risk-based approach. Therefore, Facebook would have to take reasonable measures in order to mitigate that risk."" Matze offered a potential solution to this nebula of risk and regulations, though it may not be what Facebook wants to hear... ""The easiest way to be compliant to various jurisdiction is - a fortiori - to apply the strictest regime. This approach is definitely not the cheapest for each jurisdiction but the easiest to manage on a global level.""  On the other hand, TransferWise, a London-based fintech firm focused on money transfers and cross-border payments, thinks Facebook's global reach works in its favor. The company’s CTO Harsh Sinha said “large companies with large resources” can help facilitate conversations with regulators.  “The reality is that there is quite a bit of regulatory work that goes into putting up a global network of payments but maybe there’s a way to bypass that,” he told CNBC.  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also appeared more optimistic about the project.  “Anything that works in this world will become instantly systemic and will have to be subject to the highest standards of regulations,” the central banker said Tuesday.

In a note to clients Wednesday, analyst Michael Graham wrote that Facebook's Libra Network, unveiled on Tuesday, would seemingly benefit the blockchain space, unbanked individuals and (to some ""modest"" amount) Facebook's bottom line.  However, he highlighted that the project must first receive a seal of approval, or at least no resistance, from national governments worldwide.  ""Regulatory headwinds could be hurricane force – on one level, governments should appreciate Libra for the boost it might bring to global commerce. On another level, Libra is by far the most credible crypto threat yet to government-sponsored currencies.""  Indeed, lawmakers and regulators are already pushing back against the project. In the U.S., Representatives Maxine Waters and Patrick McHenry, respectively the chair and ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, have called for a hearing with Facebook executives to discuss libra, with Waters going as far as to ask Facebook to cease development – at least temporarily.  Elsewhere  , Markus Ferber, a German member of the European Parliament, said Facebook should not be ""allowed to operate in a regulatory nirvana,"" while French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the libra cannot become a sovereign currency.  Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, also weighed in, saying he held an open mind but that the libra should be examined closely.  'Global good'  Regulatory hurdles aside, Graham appeared to be bullish about both the libra and the effect it may have worldwide.  ""We see Libra as socially conscientious leverage of the company's global clout to bring financial inclusion to billions of Earth's citizens for the first time,"" he wrote.  As for the libra's implications for the blockchain space, he noted that Facebook's goal is to only hold 1/100 of the votes for the Libra Association, the governing council that will make decisions about the protocol. In his view, this is ""the right level of centralization.""  More importantly, if the libra succeeds, it might validate the blockchain payments model. He went so far as to suggest it may become the most valuable cryptocurrency, writing:  ""However, if Libra fulfills its ambitions, it could potentially displace bitcoin and other existing digital assets that are primarily used as a payments vehicle or store of value.""  The note also touched on secondary benefits that Facebook's launch partners may see. Merchants that utilize the libra may see lower fees and an increased number of customers, he wrote, specifically mentioning Lyft, Uber, eBay, PayPal and Spotify.  On the other hand, companies like PayPal may also face issues if the libra model succeeds.  Graham returned to the potential number of users in his closing summary, writing that ""billions of potential Libra adopters can be targeted in minutes,"" if unbanked individuals suddenly gain access to financial services.

42430634,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwVdh,1560949660,'Hard Core Fund' Collects 50 BTC to Support Bitcoin Developers,"According to venture capitalist Dovey Wan of Primitive Ventures, finding sustainable funding for bitcoin developers is the biggest challenge facing the ecosystem in 2019.  To bridge that gap, she’s helped gather 50 BTC -- an amount worth just north of $450,000 at press time prices -- that are now up for grabs.  Wan partnered with Bitmain alum Pan Zhibiao to create the nonprofit Hard Core Fund in 2018, then started supporting Bitcoin Core contributors Luke Dashjr and Ben Woosley last fall.  Woosley told CoinDesk that he sends the fund co-founders an email every month detailing the engineering work he completed, including code review and pull requests on the Bitcoin Core GitHub page. With that information, the fund sends him a small portion of his year-long bitcoin salary.  A fresh batch of donations means the fund is now open to applications from more developers. While many contributors have donated anonymously to the fund, known benefactors including entrepreneur Kevin Pan of Poolin and others from China's crypto ecosystem.  “We collected 50 bitcoin,” Wan told CoinDesk. “Right now, you wouldn’t believe it, there are less than 10 full-time bitcoin developers. ...We want to fund full-time independent bitcoin developers.”  To be fair, it’s hard to say how many people work full time on Bitcoin Core if you include independent research and open source, nonprofit projects like crypto wallets. Several organizations already support open source development, such as Chaincode Labs, Blockstream, MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, and Square. In the future, Dovey said, she expects companies like Microsoft to support independent developers.  Yet while Woosley expressed ample respect for the above-mentioned companies, he said this fund is the “most independent” funding model for bitcoin development that he’s seen so far.  “We should be wary of forming a bias, of groupthink,” Woosley said. “Having diverse funding models helps protect us against groupthink on any given topic.”  Open for business  The fund has no say over what the developers prioritize, although the cofounders are themselves fascinated by updates that relate to the lightning network and fungibility. Instead, the money is distributed based on evidence of past contributions to Bitcoin Core and continued work on any aspect of the project the developer chooses.  Prospective applicants can now send their biography information and GitHub profile to Wan’s Primitive Ventures email.  Pan, who helps manage the fund’s daily operations, told CoinDesk:  “We are looking for someone who’s got a deep understanding of Bitcoin’s architecture and its existing problems to solve...if he or she can train, coach, or facilitate other developers, propose new BIPs [protocol updates] and new directions for technical improvement, that’s even better.”  As one of the donors, Qtum Foundation founder Patrick Dai agreed with Dovey and Woosley about the importance of contributing to open source development.  “The Qtum project inherited a lot of great technology from Bitcoin’s development work,” Dai told CoinDesk. “There are so many companies and projects and individuals benefiting a lot from Bitcoin software. The easiest way to say thanks is to give some support to the talented developers behind the bitcoin network.”  Image of Dovey Wan at Consensus 2019 via Brady Dale, CoinDesk",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/06/19/hard-core-fund-collects-50-btc-to-support-bitcoin-developers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30821764747429c57d52b9b8eb39421d0cf3e694-1477x911.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430630,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwVfh,1560949258,Internet Security Provider Cloudflare Announces an Ethereum Gateway,"Internet security provider Cloudflare is introducing the Ethereum Gateway to its Distributed Web Gateway toolbox enabling users to interact with the Ethereum network without installing any software. This is part of Cloudflare’s Distributed Web Gateway project to expand the decentralized web ecosystem and enhance its reliability, speed, and ease of use.  Instead of downloading and cryptographically verifying hundreds of gigabytes of data -- an impossible task for low-power devices and those with low technical barriers to entry -- the gateway enables any device with web access to interact with the Ethereum network.  This setup will make it possible to explore the blockchain and add interactive elements to sites powered by Ethereum smart contracts. In fact, the gateway gives people the ability to put new contracts on Ethereum with having to run a node, because Cloudflare will take a signed transaction and push it to the network thereby allowing miners to cryprographicaly add it.  Despite the value Cloudflare brings to gateway clients, the service is completely free. Nick Sullivan, Cloudflare’s Head of Cryptography, explains that the program “leverages the existing Cloudflare network, which already provides a number of free services.”  Sullivan notes it’s too young a system to introduce costs, but there may be revenue opportunities down the line.  For now though, the company’s modus operandi is to expand access and utility of smart contracts to the uninitiated. In a sense, Sullivan suggested Cloudflare is doing it for developers and ecosystem at large. “To show computing can be done differently.”  “By providing a gateway to the Ethereum network we can help users make the jump from general web-user to cryptocurrency native, eventually making using the distributed web a fundamental part of the Internet,” Jonathan Hoyland wrote in a blog post.  Though Cloudflare sees itself as only one access point among “the constellation of gateways that already exist,” meaning that despite the added speed of its backchannel, it will not become a centralized authority on the chain.  Currently, newbie visitors to the gateway’s website can interact with an example app, but the ambitious should access the RPC API, where it’s possible to do virtually anything available on the Ethereum network itself, from examining contracts, to transferring funds.  Despite ambitions to break down the barriers to distributed computing, Sullivan said the majority of Cloudflare users are hobbyists. This is not to exclude the number of independent bloggers, image sharing websites, and technologists that leverage Cloudflare’s IFPS gateway.  “ETH and IPFS are big names in very small space -- the crypto space. But in a broader audience they’re not very well known, not commonly understood,” said Sullivan. “Part of this announcement is to help elevate the profile of these protocols... to solve difficult problems with distributed computing.”  This announcement is part of Cloudflare’s Crypto Week.

42430650,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwW7h,1560942023,Bitcoin's Price Snaps Longest Daily Win Streak Since 2018,"View  Bitcoin fell 2.87 percent on Tuesday, ending the longest stretch of daily gains since July 2018. The long-term outlook, however, remains bullish with the 3-day chart calling a move to $10,000.  On the way higher, BTC may face resistance at the key Fibonacci retracement level of $9,642.  The hourly and 4-hour charts are reporting bearish indicator divergences. As a result, a correction to key support at $8,600 could be seen before a potential rally to $10,000.      Bitcoin's (BTC) price closed on a negative note on Tuesday, snapping the longest daily winning streak in 11 months.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 2.87 percent yesterday, having scored 2-5 percent gains in each of the preceding six days.  That was the longest stretch of daily price gains since July 2018. Back then, the price had advanced for seven successive days – from July 13 to July 19 – to hit highs above $7,500, as per data source CoinMarketCap.  The latest six-day winning streak saw bitcoin rise from $8,120 to $9,366, possibly due to the hype surrounding Facebook’s foray into cryptocurrencies, Binance.com’s decision to ban US customers and other factors, as discussed on Monday.    On Tuesday, the social media giant officially launched its cryptocurrency Libra to mixed reviews with many experts calling it a net positive development for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.    Even so, BTC suffered moderate losses, possibly because Facebook’s Libra launch was priced in over the weekend.  Looking forward, the long-term outlook remains bullish with technical charts calling a rise to $10,000. However, in the next 24 hours, a correction to key support near $8,700 could be seen.  As of writing, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $9,135, according to CoinMarketCap.  3-day chart  BTC’s previous three-day candle closed above the high of $9,006 hit on May 30, establishing another bullish higher high. It is worth noting that the cryptocurrency has charted a series of higher lows and higher highs since early February.  Further, the 5- and 10-candle moving averages (MAs) continue to trend north, indicating a bullish setup and the widely followed relative strength index (RSI) has maintained the bullish bias with a bounce from the ascending trendline connecting November and January lows.  Therefore, the path of least resistance is on the higher side. On the way toward $10,000, BTC may face stiff resistance at $9,642 – 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $20,078 to $3,193.  The bullish bias would be invalidated if the price finds acceptance below the ascending 10-candle MA, currently at $8,477.  The outlook would turn bearish if the price drops below recent lows below $7,600, violating the bullish higher lows pattern.  4-hour chart  The RSI has produced lower highs on the 4-hour chart over the last five days, contradicting the higher highs on price. That bearish divergence indicates scope for a price pullback.  The bearish RSI divergence would be invalidated if the indicator cuts through the descending trendline hurdle, currently at 60.  1-hour chart  As seen above, the price is stuck between the 50-hour and 100-hour MAs.  The cryptocurrency bounced up from the 100-hour MA in Asian trading hours. So far, however, the 50-hour MA hurdle, currently at $9,198, has proved a tough nut to crack.  A break below the overnight low of $9,005 would confirm bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern and allow a deeper drop to $8,600 – support of the trendline connecting June 10 and June 11 lows.

42430631,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwVhh,1560934818,Decentralized Video Platform Built on Ethereum Raises $8 Million,"Livepeer  , a decentralized video encoding platform built on the Ethereum network, announced it has received an $8 million Series A venture capital round lead by Northzone.  Noticing the prodigious increase in video streaming across the web and the prohibitive costs involved in transcoding, serial entrepreneurs Doug Petkanics and Eric Tang built a platform that links encoding providers with anyone who needs processing power for video services.  The infrastructure functions as a “token coordinating network,” incentivizing those with computing power to join and match the needs of those looking to stream, by offering the ability to get paid for their idle processing power in ethereum.  Currently the company has more than 30 providers of compute power on the platform, and more than 100 events have streamed video through Liverpeer. Though Petkanics told TechCrunch, those users may have been an “early-adopter, philosophically-aligned crowd.”  Livepeer is designed for developers who want to build applications that include live video, users who want to stream video, gaming, coding, entertainment, or educational courses, and broadcasters who currently have large audiences and high streaming bills or infrastructure costs.  By making use of idle processing power, Liverpeer drives down the price for encoding. Petkanics said the system is 10 times cheaper than incumbent streaming providers, equivalent to two streams for roughly 70 cents per day, compared to $3 per stream per hour of traditional streaming services.  Founders see an additional growth opportunity in bootstrapping the excess capacity of GPUs used by crypto miners, thereby further reducing costs. Though they also said the Series A funding will go towards implementing applications outside of the purview of crypto-fans to enter the larger marketplace.  The company is offering six months free for new participants as an inducement to try the platform.  Video infrastructure behemoth Brightcove’s former CEO David Mendels joined the upstart as an advisor to the company. And Houseparty founder Ben Rubin was part of the Series A round. Additionally, Digital Currency Group — which acquired CoinDesk in 2016 — Libertus, Collaborative Fund, Notation Capital, Compound, North Island and StakeZero also provided funding.

42430626,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwVVh,1560931801,'Phase Zero' of a New Ethereum Blockchain Could Go Live Next January,"The next major iteration of the ethereum blockchain – dubbed ethereum 2.0 – may see a partial launch as early as January 2020.  Proposed by Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake in a bi-weekly coordination call between ethereum 2.0 developers, the date suggestion was raised after affirming that a code freeze of the first iteration of ethereum 2.0, called Phase Zero, was ""on track"" for June 30.  ""We still have quite a bit of time before the end of 2019, so I think looking at a target genesis date towards end of 2019 could be realistic. One thing that could work well is the 3rd of January 2020,"" said Drake during the call.  But that January 3rd date isn't a done deal, in spite of reports to the contrary.  Fellow Ethereum Foundation researcher Danny Ryan stressed in email to CoinDesk that the proposed date hasn't been finalized and additional work on testing ethereum 2.0 will factor into such a decision.  Ryan emphasized:  ""Although it is feasible, the client teams are not yet ready to commit to a date, especially considering we haven't entered into multi-client testnets yet. With each phase of development there are plenty of unknowns so we will just keep ... tackling them as they come.""  Speaking more deeply to the requirements needed for a stable Phase Zero launch, Drake highlighted that researchers are presently targeting a minimum amount of 2 million ETH staked on the ethereum 2.0 network. By today's estimates, this would mean the re-vamped ethereum blockchain would be launching with over $500 million in ETH locked by prospective ethereum 2.0 validators, who are envisioned to take on the same role as miners on the current ethereum blockchain.  Forward to Serenity  Since the network's inception, developers have been looking ahead to an eventual transition to a proof-of-stake consensus model, dubbed Serenity.  Both block creation and transaction validation in proof-of-stake generates rewards for users who attest to the validity of the blockchain by locking a portion of their tokens holdings on the network. Unlike proof-of-work, which is the model ethereum currently leverages, amount of tokens staked is primarily how users compete for network rewards as opposed to computational energy expended.  To encourage a safe on-boarding experience for current ethereum miners looking at transitioning to the ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake blockchain as validators, Drake mentioned that opening up the deposit contract for staked ETH this October during Devcon, an annual gathering held by the Ethereum Foundation, could be wise.  ""The idea here is to try and launch the deposit contract ahead of the targeted genesis [date] so that we allow time for validators to make their deposits,"" explained Drake. ""One idea is to do a deposit contract ceremony at Devcon. One of the reason of having this very public ceremony is so that we can all agree on the exact address of the deposit contract and avoid scam deposit contracts.""  While the timeline for Phase Zero of ethereum 2.0 has yet to be finalized, past experience suggests a mainnet launch next January is within reach for ethereum developers and researchers.  ""From my experience with [ethereum 1.0], I'd definitely say [end-of-year] 2019 / Jan 2020 is a feasible target. For comparison, the pre-audit spec freeze of ethereum 1.0 was Jan 2015 and the launch was July 2015,"" ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin told CoinDesk in email.

According to a Financial Times report on Tuesday, Carney noted during a central bank meeting in Portugal that he remains ""open minded"" on the utility of Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency, admitting that worldwide payments systems are largely unequal at the moment.  However, he stated that it would be inevitable for Facebook to meet the highest standards of regulation should it succeeded in signing up users.  Carney added the U.K. central bank would scrutinize Facebook's crypto payments plan ""very closely"" and will collaborate with global forces including G7 countries, the Bank of International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund as well as the Financial Stability Board, for which Carney served as a former chair.  Based on the report, Carney also raised questions on how Facebook would be able to ensure anti-money laundering measures while protecting users' data privacy.  Carney's comment came after Facebook revealed its long-anticipated cryptocurrency initiative in an effort to build a global peer-to-peer payments network.  Such move had drawn criticism from both home and abroad for the social media giant. Hours following its announcement on Tuesday, financial regulators in Europe already voiced concerns over the possibility of Facebook's Libra becoming a shadow bank and asked for closer scrutiny over the project.  A lawmaker that heads the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee had even asked Facebook to halt the development of Libra for the time being until hearings could be held.

The arrest — which occurred on March 27, 2019 — was part of a wider investigation into a Boston-based drug syndicate that operated through the darknet site EastSideHigh.  During the investigation, an undercover federal agent ordered MDMA from the “EastSideHigh” vendors. Later this officer allegedly observed Binh Thanh Le, 22, deposit an envelope containing the agent’s order into a United States Postal Service collection box in Stoughton, a neighborhood in Boston.  Agents devised a sting meeting with Le, arresting him after he transferred bitcoin to the agents. It is unclear if Le collaborated with the federal agents throughout the investigation.  Le’s conspirators, Steven McCall, 23, and Allante Pires, 22, were later arrested on charges of conspiring to make and distribute controlled substances, including MDMA, Ketamine, and Xanax.  According to the charging documents, Le, McCall, and Pires received wholesale quantities of controlled substances in the mail. The three men then processed and manufactured those controlled substances at an office space they rented in Stoughton. Pursuant to federal search warrants, numerous envelopes containing narcotics connected to this drug distribution scheme were intercepted.  The arrests were made following the execution of a search warrant at their office space. Upon entry, the agents found and arrested McCall, who was wearing latex gloves and a respirator, believed to be in the process of filling drug orders.  During the search, agents found a computer with the EastSideHigh vendor page open, and numerous packages containing MDMA and Ketamine, various shipping and packaging materials, and a pill press. In total, authorities also seized 20 kilograms of MDMA, more than seven kilograms of Ketamine, over 10,000 Xanax pills, and more than $100,000 in cash.

Thankfully, Facebook posted a few easy-to-follow videos about the Libra ecosystem and even the new Calibra wallet.  First up, we see a short demo of the Calibra app running on iOS. The app looks very similar to other apps like PayPal and Venmo and Facebook will also embed its services into WhatsApp and Messenger. The most interesting thing? You won't need a Facebook account to use Libra.    Next up we have the Libra Ecosystem including a very simple description of blockchain technology. It's definitely a solid primer on what is actually a complex and difficult problem.    Still too complex? This very basic ""Blockchain 101"" post describes how Libra – and other blockchain-based – cryptocurrencies work.    Finally, we have a brief video about the Libra Association, a non-profit that will manage the cash associated with the project. Think of the Association as a group of non-profits who will aim their do-gooding at various global problems. In short, Facebook is hoping this project not only makes money but helps the unbanked.

At first glance at the upgrade, it can be easily seen that it&apos;s directed towards revamping the security and usability of the TRON blockchain.
