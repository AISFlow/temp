42382411,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rb2L,1564094831,"In First, SEC Clears Blockchain Gaming Startup to Sell Ethereum Tokens","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a no-action letter to Pocketful of Quarters (PoQ), a gaming startup looking to issue tokens on the ethereum blockchain.  PoQ may legally sell its Quarters tokens to consumers without registering them as securities, the SEC Division of Corporation Finance wrote in its second no-action letter to a company seeking to launch a token sale. (The first was granted in April to TurnKey Jet, a business-travel startup.)  Quarters are built according to the ERC-20 standard – the first such token to receive U.S. regulatory approval.  In the July 25 letter, Jonathan Ingram, chief legal officer for the SEC's FinHub wing, wrote:  ""Based on the facts presented, the Division will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if, in reliance on your opinion as counsel that the Quarters are not securities, PoQ offers and sells the Quarters without registration under Section 5 of the Securities Act and does not register Quarters as a class of equity securities under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.""  ""The thing that's notable here, this is the first ERC-20 public blockchain token [approved for a sale],"" said Lewis Cohen of DLX Law, which worked with PoQ to secure the letter.  The token is a stablecoin, with PoQ setting the price of the Quarters as the only seller, PoQ CEO George Weiksner said. This is part of the company's compliance requirement with the SEC. (A smart contract prevents tokens from being sent to unapproved accounts, thereby restricting secondary trading.)  PoQ also raised money through a registered securities sale using an investment token, which will remain separate from the Quarters sale.  The two-token system is meant to ensure that users conduct transactions with Quarters, rather than hold them in the hopes of securing a return, Weiksner explained.  He said he hopes Quarters will improve the gaming experience for players who are tired of spending large sums for different platforms, adding:  ""It's a way to make games better.""  ""The most important thing for teenage boys is playing video games and this might be the first financial product that they have and it'll be a crypto wallet,"" said Michael Weiksner, the company's principal (and George's father).  PoQ is working with Apple and Google to sell Quarters tokens in the App and Google Play stores, respectively, the elder Weiksner said.  Launch conditions  The no-action letter requires a PoQ to follow a number of commitments, including ensuring that players can't sell, buy or exchange tokens with each other. Rather, only developer or ""influencer"" accounts will be able to transact with players.  ""Players can never buy or sell or exchange to anyone except for approved developers, and that's a key component of our ... [compliance] strategy,"" Michael Weiksner said.  ""Accounts are born as regular accounts but they're restricted, so they can't exchange,"" he said. ""The default accounts are restricted and only approved accounts can accept Quarters.""  At present, only PoQ can approve accounts, and there are no concrete plans to grant other entities the ability to do so, he said. PoQ is still looking into whether that's possible.  Developers and influencers will have to pass know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) processes before they can get an approved account.  According to the letter, Pocketful of Quarters has fully developed its platform and can go live before any tokens are sold.  Moreover, the Quarters tokens ""will be immediately usable for their intended purpose"" with PoQ's gaming platform when the sale begins, and ""only developers and influences with approved accounts will be capable of exchanging Quarters for [ether] at pre-determined exchange rates by transferring their Quarters to the Quarters Smart Contract.""  The SEC's Ingram warned that ""any different facts or conditions might require the Division to reach a different conclusion.""  ""Further, this response expresses the Division's position on enforcement action only and does not express any legal conclusion on the question presented or on the applicability of any other laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering and related frameworks,"" he wrote.  Reaching this point took PoQ and DLX the better part of a year, Michael Weiksner said.  Cohen told CoinDesk, ""we have long championed the importance of working with, rather than against, regulators, and we believe the outcome today of this ... letter, the first-ever ERC-20 that can be sold without being a securities offering, I think it's an incredibly important point.""  He concluded:  ""It required a lot of patience, and it shows that not every ERC-20 token is a securities offering and it is a positive event in working with regulators.""

42382405,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9raxJ,1564087511,"Bitcoin Escrow Firm Bilked Investors for $7 Million, DOJ Says","U.S. prosecutors have charged the head of a bitcoin escrow company with defrauding investors for $7 million.  The U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, part of the Department of Justice (DOJ), brought two counts each of commodity and wire fraud against Jon Barry Thompson, principal of Volatnis Escrow Platform LLC. In a complaint unsealed Thursday, he is accused of making misleading statements about investment risks and false representations of his custody and control of digital assets.  U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement:  “As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”  Thompson “preyed” on his clients' lack of information regarding the emerging asset class, prosecutors said. In promotional materials and communication with clients, he allegedly presented himself as a competent investor, custodian, or financier.  The two companies Thompson allegedly defrauded sent him multi-million-dollar wires hoping to receive bitcoin in exchange. Prosecutors alleged that Thompson told one client, “cash is with me, coin is with me,” though he had sent their $3 million to a third-party exchange, skimming thousands off the top for personal use, without first obtaining any bitcoin.  The DOJ did not identify either alleged victim. According to a Forbes article published in January, Volantis negotiated a deal to transfer 6,600 bitcoin to Symphony, a crypto investments firm, but “the transaction never closed.”  Thompson, who was arrested Thursday in Pennsylvania, faces a maximum sentence of 40 years.

42382383,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rXbj,1564086602,Bancor Raised $153 Million and Found Actual Users. Why Did Its Price Tank?,"The cryptocurrency industry is still grappling with the legal implications of the initial coin offering (ICO) trend of 2017.  Two years after the token boom, the value of Bancor's BNT token is in the dumps – sinking from $4.49 in July 2017 to an all-time low last week of $0.44, according to CoinMarketCap.  Yet, the project's main investors are still holding.  For example, Yoni Assia, CEO of the crypto exchange eToro, described the $153 million Bancor ICO as a “pivotal” moment for the industry and told CoinDesk he is holding BNT because he believes in the team.  The Bancor platform, which provides quick liquidity for niche ERC-20 tokens by using BNT as a market-making reserve currency for all assets on the network, has routinely attracted 100-250 traders a week, according to Etherscan’s tally of BNT token transactions.  The trouble is, there are still legal questions surrounding many of the assets traded on the Bancor platform. This may be part of the reason the startup issued a new policyhttps://support.bancor.network/hc/en-us/articles/360029588431-US-Service-Restriction as of July 8, barring Americans from the platform due to “increased regulatory uncertainty.” (Bancor declined to offer comment for this article.)  One anonymous American Bancor user told CoinDesk he was “very disappointed” he can no longer use his BNT because the platform is now restricted in the U.S.  Traders have used the platform primarily to find arbitrage opportunities for assets like ether and EOS, several traders told CoinDesk, in addition to more niche offerings. For example, Michael Safai of the San Francisco-based fund Dexterity Capital, told CoinDesk his firm used Bancor for arbitrage strategies last year.  Safai said “a lot of people” were placing simultaneous orders on Bancor and EtherDelta – an exchange charged in 2018 with unregistered securities trading – pulling out of whichever order proved less profitable. Although he doesn’t work with such exchanges any more, Safai said such trades could range from $10,000-$100,000.  “It’s kind of like putting your hand, hand over hand, on a baseball bat to see who goes first,” Safai said, explaining how institutional investors used Bancor to dominate the market for specific ERC-20 tokens. “We saw people take losses, actually pay more in gas [transaction fees] just to fight people. … It was like a winner takes all game.”  Safai added this type of activity declined in 2018, when regulatory action put a “chilling effect” on niche token trades among professional traders.  Since then, most Bancor activity derives from non-U.S. jurisdictions. Turkish trader Furkan Ahmet Sunman told CoinDesk he still trades up to $10,000 worth of crypto on the platform every month.  “It is an easy way to convert tokens and it protects my identity,” he said. “Generally, I use Bancor for trading. … Bancor offers the use of my wallet or tokens without limitations.”  One Bancor advisor who spoke on the condition of anonymity told CoinDesk that although Bancor completed “almost everything they talked about” during the token sale, the team is currently “doing all sorts of other stuff with those [token sale] funds.” He added:  “Is [Bancor] worth the huge amount that they’ve raised? Probably not.”  Crypto empire  It’s hard to say what other “stuff” the team is doing with its ICO funds given the lack of public documentation.  According to paperwork filed with the Israeli Corporations Authority, Bancor co-founders Galia and Guy Benartzi now own shares in several startups including BlockchainIL, LiquidEOS and LiquidApps, which is currently operating another token sale.  Both Benartzi siblings are listed as LiquidApps co-founders in the white paper, along with fellow Bancor co-founder Eyal Hertzog. Out of eight LiquidApps co-founders, only two are not already Bancor team members.  As for LocalCoin Ltd, the for-profit Israeli entity contracted by the non-profit Bancor Foundation to work on the platform, BNT holder Tim Draper is listed alongside Bancor’s founding team as one of the startup’s shareholders.  “I think [the Bancor founding team] have been hard at work to build a new economic system,” Draper told CoinDesk. “I hope to see Bancor tokens being used as everything from simple marketplace tokens, to individual tokens where each worker will have a token and employers will have to buy [BNT] to get [employees] to work for them.”  All the Benartzi siblings’ crypto ventures in Israel since the ICO, from LiquidEOS to BlockchainIL, have overlapping shareholders, with some including their relatives. In this sense, Bancor has become the epicenter of a token ecosystem that reaches beyond the platform itself.  According to Bancor’s blog, the platform has facilitated the creation of 148 tokens so far. People like engineer Michael Fletcher at the UK-based leasing startup Chintai use Bancor’s platform for its intended purpose: providing liquidity to niche projects.  “If you pay with our token, CHEX, we automatically convert it to EOS to pay the fee,” Fletcher told CoinDesk about how CHEX users pay for the startup’s leasing services, adding:  “The main benefits of Bancor and BNT is you have access to a huge surge of liquidity, soon as the price spikes, arbitrators are incentivised to autonomously deposit into the scales to balance them back out.”  Legal questions  Bancor has proven to be a useful tool for crypto fans worldwide. Yet it’s unclear which liabilities, if any, Bancor has in relation to such traders.  Bancor is still known for easy liquidity these days, traders say, but not security. Hackers stole $13.5 million worth of tokens from Bancor’s platform in 2018. Bancor has a built-in backdoor to help protect such users in case of emergency, although some experts believe that could complicate the team’s legal responsibilities.  According to Anderson Kill attorney Stephen Palley, an exchange or token issuer that doesn’t disclose at the time of sale that an asset could be destroyed or moved at-will might run afoul of consumer protection laws on both the state and federal levels for “unfair and deceptive trade practices.” (Even if American traders can no longer use the Bancor, several American traders told CoinDesk they bought BNT tokens during the 2017 ICO.)  The word “disclosure” only appears once in the Bancor white paper, referencing how earnings from the sale will be distributed. However, the company’s website does say in all caps that Bancor has the right to “discontinue” any “content” on its platform without warning. This may refer to Bancor’s ability to delete, create or move tokens on-chain. The team doesn’t hide this architecture choice.  According to a joint statement by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) released this month, an entity that is “involved in effecting transactions in digital asset securities … is subject to the federal securities laws.” Meanwhile, it’s unclear whether any of the assets on Bancor will be classified as securities.  The SEC pursued enforcement action against the comparable exchange platform EtherDelta in 2018. Two anonymous Israeli sources told CoinDesk the Bancor team has allegedly been contacted by the SEC.  As global regulators continue to clarify which digital assets are deemed securities, Bancor continues to regularly serve hundreds of traders. Among companies funded by token sales to retail investors, that usage alone makes Bancor an anomaly.

As detailed in a story published Monday, the newspaper asserts it uncovered a scheme by which Maduro and his associates were using a digital wallet app to turn tax revenue from domestic airports into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that were then transferred to exchanges in Hong Kong, Hungary, Russia and China.  There, the funds were converted and sent back to Venezuela, according to the report.  The effort is the latest example of how the ban on Maduro's government from using US bank accounts and from participating in the open international market has forced it to look at cryptocurrencies as a way to obtain dollars.  The newspaper alleges that the tax revenue in question came from the Maiquetia International Airport (IAIM) located near Caracas, the country's capital, and that taxes were collected through an automated system that works with an app called Jetman Pay.  Maduro's administration is said to be in talks to expand its use of the app, including for proceeds it collects from refueling airplane that traffic the airport.  In a contract – allegedly yet to be signed – the Jetman Pay app would be used to directly defy the U.S. ban again. Under the scheme, a plane would land at IAIM, at which point it would transfer fiat currencies in exchange for fuel. Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A, the state's oil and natural gas company, would then use the app to pay government taxes, upon which it would be sent abroad as cryptocurrency.  The automated system has been used at IAIM since February 2018 for airport tax collection.  The report concluded by speculating that Maduro may be looking to expand the scheme to other airports across the country.

Wright trial.  In a letter addressed to the British Queen’s High Court, dated July 22, Judge Bruce Reinhart requested Watts testify under oath as part of an international judicial assistance. The request is made on behalf of the plaintiff, as Watts' appearance may be relevant to court proceedings and useful to the plaintiff’s case.  Plaintiff Ira Kleiman is suing Watts’ husband for civil theft, fraud, unjust enrichment, and breach of partnership duties of loyalty and care relating to a purported multi-billion dollar cache of bitcoin. Kleiman, who represents his late brother Dave Kleiman’s estate, alleges the Australian technologist unlawfully took possession of the bitcoin collectively mined by his brother and Wright.  Though the total amount of bitcoin is unknown, Kleiman believes the estate is due at least 300,000 bitcoins, and their respective forked assets.  Reinhart alleges in the document Watts, as wife and business associate to Wright, is knowledgeable to the facts of the case. She will be called to testify on non-privileged statements made by Wright regarding Kleiman, the creation of bitcoin, his mining activity, and the Tulip Trust at the “heart” of the case.  Of note is W&K Info Defense Research, a firm incorporated in 2011 by Dave Kleiman, and the firm’s former director, Uyen Nguyen. Watts will provide testimony regarding Wright’s statements that he was not involved in the firm and has lost touch with Nguyen.  The plaintiff’s council allege Wright forged documents and emails that purport Kleiman elected Nguyen to director “in an effort to facilitate [Wright's] theft of W&K’s property,"" a year after Kleiman's death.  Also called to testify are novelist Andrew O’Hagan, who was contracted to write the The Satoshi Affair, which purports to be a biography of Satoshi Nakamoto, and Robert MacGregor, who has purchased Nakamoto’s life rights.  O’Hagan is said to have had close access to Wright for six months, and is compelled to submit his notes, “many hours of tape” interviews and drafts relating to the book.

Speaking during a quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, the social media giant's founder sought to assure investors that Facebook would act responsibly with its development of Libra, the ambitious crypto project revealed last month as a potential payments rail for unbanked individuals.  Facebook worked with ""prospective members"" of its governing council, the Libra Association, to publish its white paper last month in order to address questions about it, he said. ""We're committed to working with policymakers to get this right.""  The company initially said it aims to launch the currency in the first half of 2020, but the pushback from regulators and politicians has called that timeline into question.  In response to an analyst's question about timing, Zuckerberg said Facebook's approach to Libra is ""to try and have a very open dialogue,"" and that unlike a few years ago, when the company might have just launched a new product, today Facebook tries to detail what specific ""ideas and ... values we think an eventual service should have.""  ""We've opened a period of, however long it takes to address regulators and different experts and constituents’ questions about this and then figure out what the best way to move forward is,"" Zuckerberg said, adding:  ""That's certainly what we're planning to do with Libra. So we worked with the 27 other members of the Association to publish the white paper to put the idea out there, expecting that this is a very important and heavily regulated area and that there were going to be a lot of questions. And we're going to have to work through that.""  Staying on message  Zuckerberg's comments echo statements made by David Marcus, Facebook's blockchain lead.  Marcus, who used to sit on the board of crypto exchange and Libra Association member Coinbase, testified before Congress last week in back-t0-back hearings in an attempt to assure legislators that Facebook would not launch Libra until all regulatory questions have been answered.  However, Marcus stopped short of promising to halt development entirely.  ""We are trying to provide a safe and stable and well-regulated product, so that's always been the strategy and we'll continue to engage here,"" Zuckerberg concluded on Wednesday.

42382399,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rXvr,1564061464,FBI Suspects Insider Trading in Long Island Iced Tea Blockchain Pivot,"The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is hunting for evidence of insider trading and securities fraud relating to the 2017 blockchain pivot of then-beverage firm Long Island Iced Tea (LTEA).  According to a search warrant request, first reported by Quartz, the FBI is seeking to gain access to encrypted messages held on a phone seized in different case involving involving securities fraud at another firm, Kelvin Medical.  After two men, Oliver Lindsay and Gannon Giguiere, were arrested in relation to that case, which Quartz suggests is still ongoing, agents found what they consider tell-tale signs of insider trading involving Long Island Iced Tea stock on Lindsay's iPhone, based on traces of the encrypted phone messages.  As such, the FBI is seeking the warrant to retrieve those messages in full based on probable cause of the crimes.  Long Island Iced Tea made headlines on Dec. 21 2017 when its stock surged following a pivot to blockchain and a change of name to Long Blockchain.  However, the firm later found itself delisted from Nasdaq over the shift, suspected to have been carried out to pump its stock, and subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  It had previously warned investors that it was facing the risk of being delisted as the SEC believed the firm “made a series of public statements designed to mislead investors and to take advantage of general investor interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology.”  The FBI warrant states that, in the encrypted messages (some if which were exchanged before the blockchain pivot), that Lindsay and ""other individuals"" had ""discussed what appears to be confidential information regarding LTEA.""  The document also says that one of the individuals is identified on the phone as ""Eric W,"" whom the FBI agent who submitted the warrant says believes is Eric Watson based on other evidence in the case. Watson was a major investor in Long Island Iced Tea at the time of the pivot, according to Quartz.  The warrant also lists several seemingly urgent messages between Lindsay and ""Eric W,"" including one that the FBI agent believes ""refers to common aspects of a pump-and-dump campaign.""  Another name that is cited in the warrant is that of Julian Davidson, who was sent WhatsApp messages by Lindsay. While it doesn't make the link, a man with the same name was executive chairman of Long Island Iced Tea at the time. It should be noted that Davidson hasn't been accused of a crime and left his position at the firm days before the blockchain pivot, according to Quartz.  The FBI agent concludes in the warrant that, based on the findings to date, there is probable cause to suspect that Lindsay and Giguiere had ""conspired with each other and others to, and did, trade LTEA securities on the basis of material, non-public information,"" in violation of various laws.

In a blog post, vpnMentor said its research team, led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, discovered a database leak as part of their web-mapping project and traced it back to YouHodler.  The data, they found, exposed comes to more then 86 million records that includes users’ names, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers and birthdays. It gets worse. Credit card numbers, CVV numbers, bank details and crypto wallet addresses were also exposed in the data.  ""The implications of this breach are extensive,"" said the firm.  VpnMentor said it had contacted YouHodler on July 22, which responded a day later and fixed the issue.  YouHodler's website indicates that it has served over 3,500 customers and provided over $10 million in loans.  In its own blog post on the breach, YouHodler claimed the exposed files ""did not contain any sensitive information and no one was affected.""  The first part of that statement flies in the face of the researchers' findings, however. Rotem and Locar provided screengrabs of the data (with portions hidden to conceal user data) that seem to back up the claim that they were able to find CCVs (top image) and card numbers (bottom image) in the logs.  The team said ""The first example shows that we still found all of the details needed to take full control of the card – including CVV numbers.""  They added that, while the card holder’s name isn’t displayed in either of these logs, ""numerous other records stored both names and credit card numbers together.""  The researchers further found data allowing them to link users' names to bitcoin wallet addresses.  According to vpnMentor:  ""The nature of the data that leaked from YouHodler’s database could have serious consequences. Any platform that stores credit card data should be taking several security precautions. If YouHodler only stored the BIN and last four digits of user credit cards, there wouldn’t be as much of an impact in this regard.""  YouHodler said that it ""understands user data is potentially at risk of being compromised from outside the platform,"" continuing:  ""We do our best to prevent that from happening by implementing two-factor authentication and email verification. We are sure that all security settings are checked and renewed and there’re no vulnerabilities in our systems.""  It seems its ""best"" wasn't good enough in this case.

42382396,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rXs5,1564052453,Bitcoin Price Retakes $10K But Remains Short of Bull Revival,"View  Bitcoin has again charted a recovery to above $10,000, but the outlook remains bearish with the lower-highs pattern intact.  The recent gains may be short-lived, as the recovery seen in the last 24 hours is stuck at key resistance levels and lacks volume.  A UTC close above $11,120 is needed to revive the bullish view. That level could come into play if BTC clears key resistances around $10,200 on high volumes.      Bitcoin is back above $10,000, but the technical charts indicate a bull revival is still $1,000 away.  The premier cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $10,150 on Bitstamp, having hit a low of $9,514 yesterday. This is the third time in a month that BTC has charted a quick recovery back into five figures.  Prices bounced off the former-resistance-turned support of $9,097 on July 17 and climbed back above $10,000 the following day. Before that, BTC printed a low of $9,614 on July 2 only to close well above $10,000 the same day.  On both occasions, BTC carved out lower highs – a bearish pattern – at $11,120 and $13,200, respectively.  The latest bounce may have caught some investors off guard, as BTC was on slippery grounds 24-hours ago after breaching long-term trendline support on Tuesday.  Despite the rise, the outlook remains bearish, as the lower-highs pattern is still intact. BTC needs to rally by $1,000 and beat resistance at $11,120 to invalidate lower highs and revive the bullish view.  That said, BTC may have a tough time rising above $11,120 as key resistances are currently capping upside.  Daily and 12-hour charts  BTC is struggling to rise above the resistance of the trendline connecting the July 10 and July 20 highs, currently at $10,200 (blue line above left). The bearish (downward sloping) 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are also lined up near the trendline hurdle.  Also of note, the 5- and 10-day MAs have found acceptance below the 50-day MA – the first bearish crossover since early February.  Continued low trading volumes (above right) further question the sustainability of the recovery seen in the last 24 hours.  Hence, a fall back to $9,600 cannot be ruled out, unless BTC cuts through the descending trendline on the back of high volumes.  In that case, prices could rise toward $11,120, as the 14-day RSI is already reporting a falling wedge breakout (a bullish reversal pattern).

He is also a board member of Norwegian Block Exchange, which the Kjos family owns almost outright, according to the report.

42382389,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rXjH,1564045205,How US Investors Are Buying Bitfinex's Blocked LEO Cryptocurrency,"U.S. investors have been able to purchase Bitfinex's LEO exchange tokens, if only indirectly.  Seattle-based Arrington XRP Capital and Los Angeles-based Arca both said they invested in LEO tokens, despite Bitfinex's stated policy of refusing to sell them to U.S. residents or entities.  Both investment management firms told CoinDesk that, rather than purchasing the tokens from Bitfinex, they acquired them, legally, from third parties.  The distinction is important because, in an ongoing court battle with the New York Attorney General (NYAG), Bitfinex maintains that it banned U.S. individuals from its platform in August 2017 and U.S. corporates a year later.  In arguing that it has jurisdiction in the case, the NYAG claims the exchange did business with New York entities as recently as early 2019.  'Brick wall'  Michael Arrington, a partner at Arrington XRP Capital, told CoinDesk that although his firm is registered in the Cayman Islands, he is an American. As such, Arrington XRP Capital purchased the tokens through a third party.  Bitinfex was ""strict in not selling to Americans, and even though we aren’t a U.S. fund I don’t think we would have been approved because I’m American,"" Arrington said, adding:  ""We hit a brick wall trying to do it directly.""  Similarly, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, tweeted this month that his firm, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands, had invested in LEO.  A spokesperson for the firm told CoinDesk that ""Arca legally obtained LEO tokens through a third party"" and confirmed that Dorman is a U.S. resident.  While the NYAG maintains Bitfinex has been doing business in New York longer than the exchange says, it has stopped short of claiming LEO tokens were directly sold to U.S. investors. Perhaps preemptively, Bitfinex general counsel Stuart Hoegner denied doing so in court papers filed Monday.  ""LEO tokens were not available to the general public and were not offered to any United States customers or to foreign [eligible contract participants] with shareholders that reside in the United States,"" he wrote. ""LEO tokens also may not be traded on the Bitfinex platform by any United States persons.""  A Bitfinex spokesperson told CoinDesk in early July that he ""believed"" no U.S. resident could purchase LEO tokens.  Token launch  Bitfinex announced it was launching its own exchange token earlier this year, after the NYAG office accused it of covering up an $850 million loss.  The crypto exchange lost access to its funds, which were held by payment processor Crypto Capital, last October. Crypto Capital's operators were indicted on criminal charges in April.  To cover the shortfall, Bitfinex borrowed funds from stablecoin issuer Tether, issuer of USDT, a stablecoin that was supposed to backed 1-for-1 with U.S. dollars and cash equivalents.  As part of its efforts to pay Tether back, Bitfinex held an initial exchange offering in May, claiming to raise $1 billion by selling LEO tokens.  The idea behind the token is that Bitfinex would use the proceeds from the sale to repay Tether, and use its own revenue, over time, to repurchase and burn LEO, thereby making all investors whole. In the meantime, LEO can be used to secure trading-fee discounts on Bitfinex, similar to exchange tokens issued by Binance and others.  The LEO white paper  said U.S. residents and entities would be barred from purchasing.

42382388,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rXgl,1564038082,Andrew Yang Super PAC Will Accept Lightning-Powered Bitcoin Donations,"This could be the first time the Lightning Network, a bitcoin scaling solution, officially impacts the U.S. presidential election.  Roughly a dozen bitcoiners who support Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang launched a crypto-friendly super PAC on Thursday, Humanity Forward Fund (Humanity FWD). Thanks to the PAC’s payment processor, OpenNode, the entity will be able to accept payments from lightning wallets.  “The super PAC obviously wants to receive donations as large as possible. But at the same time, individuals who want to donate just a bit to Yang’s platform now have that opportunity,” OpenNode CEO Afnan Rahman told CoinDesk. “It allows the donors to have all of the amount go toward the actual donation rather than miner fees.”  Humanity FWD will only accept bitcoin donations for the first 21 days, according to founder Seth Cohen. After that, fiat donations will also be accepted. He said the group hasn’t decided whether the PAC will hold bitcoin or immediately convert to fiat.  “Potentially earning or losing money creates additional regulatory requirements,” Cohen told CoinDesk about the challenge of managing bitcoin donations. It would mandate the PAC keep records of bitcoin’s volatility for each donation.  Even so, Cohen said, OpenNode’s 1 percent processing fee is far lower than that of credit card processors, which want to charge the super PAC up to four times as much.  Although this isn’t the first time Americans have donated bitcoin to political campaign initiatives, with states like California and South Carolina even banning direct crypto donations to the candidates, the 2020 election may be the first with a bitcoin-centric super PAC focused on garnering support for a specific candidate. (Some PACs, like the Student Debt Reform PAC Fund, also accept bitcoin.)  Plus, according to the Center for Public Integrity, nine federal candidates, parties and super PACs received nearly $570,000 worth of cryptocurrency donations during the 2017-2018 election cycle. Now Rahman said his startup is currently talking with “several” other PACs, across party lines, about supporting bitcoin donations leading up to the 2020 election.  However, Yang, in particular, has come out as the most pro-crypto candidate, even listing an official promise on his campaign’s website to “promote legislation that provides clarity” to the cryptocurrency industry. He even spoke at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019.  “There seems to be a lot of interest in Andrew’s forward-thinking policy, his views on bitcoin, specifically,” Cohen said. “We would like to raise enough to have a significant impact on this election.”  Andrew Yang image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/07/25/andrew-yang-super-pac-will-accept-lightning-powered-bitcoin-donations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/273b2a7b2e79e049ade11652f4ee95c09a7b6a8f-2340x1510.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sun published a letter on Weibo in Chinese on Thursday, saying he ""sincerely apologizes to the public, media, officials and regulatory authorities"" for his over-marketing actions, especially with his recent publicizing of a highly-anticipated charity lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett.  ""My intention of having the lunch with Buffett was because of my admiration for him and my enthusiasm for charity. It was simple, but also with self-interest to promote the blockchain industry and my project. But my immature, naive, and impulsive conducts with my big mouth have turned it into an out-of-control and failed over-marketing hype and led to a significant series of unexpected consequences,"" he wrote, adding:  ""During the whole process, I went from being excited, to worried, agonized and then terrified and regretful. ... It led to a negative influence on the public and also drew concerns from regulators who care about me. Again I want to say: I am sorry.""  Sun didn't specify which regulators he is referring to in the letter, but mentioned the term ""regulator"" 13 times. So far, he has only published the apology in Chinese. The letter comes just days after he postponed the lunch with Buffett, citing a health issue with kidney stones.  Soon after he announced the postponement, media outlets in China published reports on Tuesday saying Sun had been on China's border control list, though Sun later live streamed himself to prove he's currently in San Francisco.  In addition, Sun said in the letter he will now minimize his appearance in the public to contemplate the over-marketing issue.  ""Moving forward, due to my illness, I will take some rest, reduce my publicity on Weibo and media interviews. All the efforts spent on publicity stunt need to go back to technology development,"" he stated.  On Wednesday, Sun said in a tweet that he is feeling much better and seems to be back working at full speed on Friday. In a Weibo post on the same day, he also said he should be able to meet the outside world soon after recovery.
