Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, recently tweeted about him being optimistic but cautious of what 2023 brings in terms of regulations. Because of this, XRP has been trading sideways, a movement not altered since FTX’s collapse. Adding to the downward pressure is the significant whale activity on the market. According to Whale Alert, whales have been moving hundreds of millions worth of XRP to the open market with the biggest transfer worth $92 million. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains 4.5% in Weekly Timescale As Shanghai Upgrade Nears However, the market seems bullish despite recent bearish developments as XRP, as of writing, went up by 2% in the past 24 hours. XRP is currently trading at $0.3435, down 0.5% in the last seven days, data by Coingecko shows. Today is the first day of the 118th Congress. While prior efforts at regulatory clarity for crypto in the US have stalled, I am cautiously optimistic that 2023 is the year we will (finally!) see a breakthrough. A thread on why… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 3, 2023 What XRP’s Case Mean For Crypto And Its Price The day the SEC filed the complaint, December 21, 2020, XRP fell by 67.13% on the charts. However, December 5 proved to be a day XRP holders should rejoice. According to a report, the SEC failed to satisfy the three elements of the Howey Test which determines whether the asset is a security or not. This is a big win not just for Ripple but for the entire crypto industry as this would legitimize crypto’s place in the financial space. With the company and community hopeful for a win, Ripple released to escrow over 55% of XRP’s total supply out of which is a billion XRP. Although the market is very hopeful for a win, Garlinghouse’s statement shows a very mixed sentiment about what 2023 will bring for the company and for the world of crypto. But he is very clear on what could – or better yet, should – happen this year; break the status quo in the current U.S. legislation about what crypto should and shouldn’t be or America will lose its innovation leader status.

As of writing, investors and traders of the token are pushing the price up to test the $0.3680 price resistance range. With low correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum, it might only be slightly dampened by bad macroeconomics as recession fears grow. Crypto market FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), however, might become a problem. As of now, two events are sending negative signals to investors of crypto. First is Huobi’s decision to lay-off 20% of its workers, and the second is the Genesis-DCG fiasco. Any negative developments here might affect XRP’s ability to test its current resistance range. As the situation develops, investors and traders should capitalize on the token’s current bullish momentum. -Featured Image: The Daily Hodl",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/xrp-up-2-in-24-hours/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

It still continues to maintain this downtrend and is barely moving, just like the rest of the crypto market, but some developments among large ADA investors could see some bullish momentum for the digital asset. Cardano Whales Begin Accumulating In New Year Toward the end of 2022 when momentum in the crypt market was dropping, there had been some selling from large ADA investors. This was not out of the ordinary as the holidays have historically triggered selling and profit-taking. Related Reading: MATIC Holders Suffer Massive Losses, Here’s How Many Wallets Are In The Red Cardano whales had sold over 569 million ADA during this time. The result was more selling pressure on the digital asset that dragged its price down below $0.25, making its lowest price point since early 2021. As Santiment notes, this saw the total holdings of investors holding between 1 million and 100 million ADA on their balances drop drastically just as 2022 drew to a close. ADA whales increase holdings | Source: Santiment However, this investor class seems to have entered the new year with renewed vigor as they have already begun buying back the tokens they had dumped. The report shows that in the first five days of 2023, these large investors have already added more than 217 million ADA to their stash. This brought the percentage of supply that they now hold back up to the 57.22% level, not the highest it’s ever been, but certainly an encouraging figure. ADA Enjoys The Spoils Of Accumulation The price of ADA is already reacting to the number of coins that these Cardano whales are buying. Over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has jumped back into the green, and its price has already moved above $0.27 once more. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Jump 27% To Trade At $1,600, How Is This Possible?

The successful switch from a resistance point to a support point also shows the determination of the bulls to continue the uptrend. However, there is still the threat of bears dragging down the price of the digital asset, especially with trading volume not growing as expected.

As part of the rebalancing, Grayscale sold off a certain amount of its Digital Large Cap Fund and dumped its held tokens, including Avalanche Network token AVAX. AVAX has slipped by 2% following the sell-off in the past 24 hours. According to Grayscale, the sold-off AVAX tokens were replaced with the purchase of the existing fund components in proportion to their respective weightings. Grayscale Purchased And Existing Tokens The AVAX sell-off was only part of the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. In its CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Ex ETH Index and Grayscale Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund portfolio rebalancing, the company sold off Algorand native token ALGO. In its CoinDesk DeFi Select Index methodology, Grayscale adjusted its DeFi Fund’s portfolio and purchased Synthetix (SNX) after selling some existing assets. Related Reading: Grayscale Says It May Return 20% Of Investor Capital, Bitcoin Refuses To Budge As of now, the Grayscale portfolio fund now includes 65% Bitcoin (BTC), 30% Ethereum (ETH), 1.86% Cardano (ADA), 1.39% Polygon (MATIC), and 1% Solana (SOL). Meanwhile, its DeFi Fund’s Fund Components include 65.05% Uniswap (UNI), 12.39% Aave (AAVE), 8.15% MakerDAO (MKR), 6.02% Synthetix (SNX), 4.58% Curve DAO Token (CRV), and 3.81% Compound (COMP). Since July, Grayscale has been carefully monitoring the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index. The index launched in April tracks the market capitalization-loaded performance of “the largest and most liquid digital assets.” During Grayscale usage of the Index, the quarterly scheduled rebalancing resulted in the dumping of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), and more Uniswap (UNI) purchases. AVAX Slips After Grayscale Dumped Before the sell-off, AVAX was still sitting at a $12 zone; however, after Grayscale dumped its holdings, the AVAX token dropped by 2% and traded at $11.39 Friday morning. AVAX has appreciated over the past months. It has surged from around $9 to $13. Notably, Grayscale fund’s portfolio, which currently has $163 million in assets under management (AUM), only held a small portion of AVAX tokens. As of September 30, AVAX made up less than 1% of the company’s fund’s assets, according to its previous quarterly report.

42413213,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl87Ps,1673044698,"2 More Promoters of Forcount Crypto Ponzi Scheme Arrested, Charged With Fraud","Two additional promoters of the Forcount Ponzi scheme – a Brazil-based crypto scam that defrauded Spanish-speaking investors around the world of a collective $8.4 million – have been arrested and charged with fraud for their role in the alleged grift.  Spanish citizen Nestor Nunez, 64, was arrested in Spain on Dec. 28 and 40-year-old Ramon Perez, a U.S. citizen, surrendered himself to authorities in Orlando, Florida, on Friday. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is currently seeking Nunez’s extradition to face charges in the United States.  Perez is accused of defrauding would-be investors in the alleged scam and concealing his crime by laundering proceeds through shell companies and real estate. Prosecutors say Nunez was an actor paid by the alleged scheme’s real leader – Brazilian citizen Francisley Da Silva – to present himself as Forcount’s CEO, using the alias “Salvador Molina.”  Da Silva, along with three other founders and promoters of Forcount – Juan Antonio Tacuri Fajardo, Ramon Antonio Perez Arias, and Jose Ramiro Coronado Reyes – have already been charged with securities violations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Da Silva and Fajardo also face criminal charges.  The alleged scheme ran from 2017 to 2021. It used a network of promoters to convince investors to put money in the platform, which promised high returns based on profit sharing from non-existent mining and trading activities.  According to a criminal indictment in the case, Da Silva and his cronies frittered away customer funds on luxury goods for themselves and promotion for the alleged scam, while most victims lost their entire investments.  Perez was charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He faces a maximum sentence of 60 years in prison.  Nunez was charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud, and faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison.

Massive flight from crypto sector and crypto trading. Revenue model on Centralized Exchanges will collapse. Coinbase will survive and emerge as a winner, but take a big hit in 2023. I see price dropping by 29% to $26 by March 2023. FTX Collapse Drags All Cryptos Down With It As I write this, the crypto world has been rocked by the political and financial scandal around the FTX (FTT-USD) bankruptcy. My purpose today is not to discuss that scandal (a previous article covers that), but to look at how it will impact Coinbase Global ( COIN ) going forward. Coinbase is a digital currency exchange company that was founded in San Francisco, California in 2012. Founded by Brian Armstrong in 2012, Coinbase Global is the 800-pound gorilla in the American crypto space. Since that time, COIN quickly grew to become the dominant US crypto exchange by volume and user base. The effects of the FTX collapse and alleged monumental fraud are disastrous for the crypto space. They have led to severe drops in the value of almost all cryptocurrencies, with even stalwart frontrunners like Solana losing about two-thirds of its value since the FTX revelations. The vast majority of crypto investors have been severely hurt by the bear markets. Many crypto investors were highly leverage and have suffered life-changing losses. One consequence of the scandal is the erosion of trust in any centrally run crypto brokerages. The crypto world is awash with discussions of which big brokerage or crypto currency will be the next domino to fall. Many pundits have emerged announcing the death knell for all cryptocurrencies. (I don't agree, but I acknowledge the overwhelming negative sentiment.) As the leading crypto brokerage in the space, Coinbase is obviously enormously impacted by the overall whirlwinds buffeting the crypto industry. The Winds Buffeting Crypto in 2023 In discussing the impact on Coinbase, I'd like to begin with a macroeconomic picture of the crypto world recently painted by one of my favorite analysts: the pseudonymous ""Guy"" of Coin Bureau. In a recent video titled "" Coin Bureau Crypto Predictions 2023: My TOP 10 LIST!"" , Guy made the following 10 predictions for the impacts of the FTX scandal and other large crypto meltdowns that occurred during 2022 and how these would change crypto markets permanently. Crypto market bottom out in late 2023. The lows will occur early in quarter 2, coinciding with cessation of Fed interest rate hikes. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) will drop to $10k and possibly even $3k. Most cryptos will lose another 60%-80%, correlating with 20%-30% drops he expects for US equities. Securities Exchange Commission will crack down on another big crypto company. This could be any crypto other than Bitcoin. There will be a flood of new regulations imposed on the crypto industry. These will vary by country. After causing lots of headaches and the disappearance of many altcoins unable to comply with tem, this will eventually bring regulatory clarity to the crypto industry. As a result, more institutional investors will be willing to invest in the cryptospace, leading to a recovery of the sector later in the year. It will also force more decentralization of crypto governance. Decentralized Finance (""Defi"") will go mainstream, as they step up with better interfaces, more proof of resiliency, and known conformance with now clarified legal statutes. More crypto investors will abandon centralized exchanges (like COIN) in favor of self-custody and decentralized programmatic solutions less susceptible to out-and-out fraud. The best Defi protocols, such as AAVE, have not been and will not be targeted by the legislation. Big tradfi financial institutions, such as JP Morgan or Fidelity, will attempt to buy their way into control of those protocols. Crypto payments will become more easier, cheaper and more common, due to increase in scalability, better front ends, and the increasing liquidity resulting from institutional adoption. Layer-2 crypto solutions will increase their scalability by 10 to 100 times and will rival the speed and power of VISA credit card transactions. The number of crypto holders will grow from 4% of the population to multiples of that in 2023 , as companies such as Facebook, META, Twitter, Telegram, Instagram and TikTok roll out crypto based solutions. At least one additional country will adopt BTC as legal tender, probably Tonga, following the countries of El Salvador and the Central African Republic in 2022. Big tech companies will announce crypto integrations. They'll do so in order to create new product streams, with Twitter the most likely. The Big Wall Street wolves, such as Goldman Sachs (GS) or others, are likely to snap up the distressed assets emerging from the FTX debacle and the collapse of LUNA (LUNC-USD), Celsius (CEL-USD), Three Arrows Capital and other big crypto entities. Guy spe cifically singled out Coinbase as an asset that is likely to suffer under SEC scrutiny and policy tightening, which could force Coinbase to sell itself to a bigger player in the world of traditional finance, such as JP Morgan (JPM). Bitcoin will start being used for international trade, by countries such as Iran, Russia, India, Russia South Africa, or Saudi Arabia. Scenarios for A Takeover of COIN? His ninth prediction, as it concerns Coinbase, is of particular relevance here. Frankly, this is the first rumor I've heard about a JP Morgan takeover of Coinbase, but I would not be at all shocked by such a development. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon despite at first notoriously dismissed all cryptos and Bitcoin starting in 2017 as ""fraud"" and ""fool's gold"". But in more recent comments, he's stated that some stablecoins may have real value and he's begun to warm to the sector. Dimon's a smart man and eminently aware that if DEFI succeeds, it puts the banking sector out of business over the long term. Better to embrace and coopt the possible competitor before it is too late. His competitors, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs have already succumbed to the lure of cryptos, by offering it to their clients for the first time in 2022. Dimon has not yet retracted his earlier comments about Bitcoin or other cryptos, but he has allowed the company to cautiously begin treading down the crypto path. In February 2019, JPMorgan announced that it would roll out a digital currency called JPM Coin , and in October 2020, the firm created a new unit for blockchain projects. Last August, Coinbase announced a major new agreement by which it would service institutional clients of Blackrock's Aladdin software. This was a significant step forward toward the institutionalization of cryptos. So it would not be surprising if JP Morgan were to preempt Blackrock from gaining a controlling interest in the crown jewel of crypto brokerages. However, I do not see any big traditional bank or financial institution taking a controlling interest in Coinbase until the stock price drops a lot more. The Disastrous Earnings Report In their quarterly statement ending Sept 30, 2022, issued last November, Coinbase announced both a drop in earnings and a considerable drop in revenues. Revenues dropped 53% from $1.23 billion to $576 million compared to the previous year's quarter. Meanwhile, total expenses rose 12% from $ 1,020.1 to $1,146.8 billion. The net result was that Coinbase went from profits of $406 million for the third quarter of 2021 to losses of $545 million in 2022. The company ended the quarter with $ 5.006 billion in cash, enough to sustain 10 such quarters of losses. Investors should note that these trends were already in place even before the considerable negative fallout resulting from the FTX collapse. My Prognosis for COIN's Next Few Months I predict we will see an accelerated decline in revenues. Many crypto investors have seen life-altering drops in their portfolios. Many investors used leverage and have seen their entire crypto portfolios go to zero. A minority will hold on to their remaining positions tightly and maintain their activities in these markets. But a large number of investors who where following the momentum trade up have been burned too severely and will never return. I have no doubt that Coinbase will benefit from the flow of crypto investors from weaker brokerages to better capitalized ones, of which Coinbase is among the best. But this will not be sufficient to offset the dropoff in overall market size that I foresee over at least the next four quarters. More importantly, presumably as a result of SEC pressures, Coinbase, along with other US-based crypto exchanges have radically tightened their trading policies. In early 2021 it was trivially easy to short a crypto through US exchanges. Policy changes have made it virtually impossible to bet to the downside on cryptos today. Coinbase has suspended users' ability to use margin to take a short position in a cryptocurrency. I have no doubt that this is due to regulatory pressures, not to Coinbase management's preferences. But the consequence is that if any trader wants to stay active in the crypto space but is not currently bullish, that trader cannot put on bearish bets. This effectively means that until the bear market reverses, Coinbase's revenues from trading will dramatically shrink. Sophisticated traders, will be able to execute bearish bets by moving off of centralized exchanges and into decentralized ones, but this is not a positive development for Coinbase. The percentage of traders who are comfortable taking short positions is admittedly small, but this is the group of traders that is the most active, often placing 100 times more trades than other crypto investors. So the hit to Coinbase's trading revenues will be quite severe, I esteem. The real question is how successful the company can be in shrinking their expenses. A shrinkage of costs by 50% to 75% will be difficult to pull off. Management may take a lesson from Twitter's recent radical cuts of staffing while maintaining and even arguably improving Twitter's software features. But Coinbase, unlike Twitter, is not a private corporation. CEO Brian Armstrong must respond to a board of directors, and even if he were to favor drastic cuts he would first have to convince all others. As a result, I expect numerous quarters of rising losses until the crypto market turns around. If Coin Bureau is right in their 2023 projections, this will be in late 2023. That means a big continued drop in the stock price. Coinbase: Survival or Bankruptcy? Do I expect Coinbase to survive? Yes. They are the leading US crypto company in a shrinking market. While the bear market will be extremely painful, it will allow them to acquire talent and technologies at bargain basement prices. If management is smart, it can facilitate the desire of crypto investors to manage their own wallets and maintain their own sets of keys. If done property this can even provide a new source of revenues, to replace the lost trading fees. For example, a smoother interface allowing for easy deployment from hard wallets to Coinbase's trading exchange would go a long way to attracting new users. A potential new insurance fund from a well-viewed company like Lloyd's of London backing all assets held on the Coinbase exchange - similar to FDIC or SIPC protection - would also be a huge attraction that most crypto users would be willing to pay for. As mentioned above, Coinbase has enough cash on hand to sustain about 10 quarters of losses at present negative cash flows. The time will be reduced if Coinbase's revenues shrink faster than management can reduce costs. My Price Prognosis: Another 29% Dip Before Recovery Trying to gauge Coinbase's fair market value based on fundamental factors is extremely difficult, given the unpredictability of its earnings stream and the wide variation in its potential future earnings sources. To that you must add the enormous risk inherent from possible government regulatory crackdowns. A good estimate for this was done on Seeking Alpha pages 1 year ago by Michel Sanguanini . The author's estimate was for a fair value of $185. The fact that the price today is 80% lower does not invalidate that analysis. It just underlines how schizophrenic Mr Market can be. In my 15 years of investing experience, I've found technical analysis to be a much better guide to predicting those schizophrenic ups and downs, because technical analysis inherently accounts for the psychology of the market. That analysis is shown on the graph below. Coinbase LongTerm Chart Weekly Candles (stockcharts.com) I use Fibonacci intervals along with Elliott wave analysis to project my expected price pivots. My rule of thumb is this. If a wave is formed (minimum 27 to 38% retracement or gap up or down0 and then breached, then a subsequent ""mirrored"" wave occurs with 70% probability. A third (Elliott wave 4->5 wave) is possible, but less likely, with approximately a 30% probabililty. That's why, in the graph above, I've colored some of the waves yellow (less likely), versus red (highly likely). As you can see, all of the ""required"" mirroring patterns have already occurred, and COIN does not ""need"" to go lower for it to correspond to Elliott cycles. That said, the most recent fractal pattern which began forming in August 2022, has already almost completed its 268% expected drop to a wave V. Note that the 30 day RSI is still negatively sloped (dark grey tracing). This suggests the fifth wave will reach its expected fibo projection down to a price of $25.52. That's about 29% lower than today's price of $37.70. I've found predicting cycles - the time it takes for a price to be reached - to be much less reliable in my technical toolset. But time cycles suggest that that drop should happen by amount mid March 2023. I will be preparing some option trades based on that assumption. At that low of $25, a retracement of 38% is very likely, back up to the pivot point around $62. It's still too early to say if the other larger fractal that began in November of 2021 will then come into play, fully extending COIN down 268% to the price of $13.14. Because COIN is a relatively recent stock, we don't have price/rsi history going back 50 and 100 months to give us better color on that issue. If Coin Bureau's analysis of the overall crypto market is correct - and I largely concur with it - I think the $25 price will likely mark the all time low. I give that a better chance than the drop to $13. That said, anybody expecting a quick recovery back to the IPO highs will have to be very very patient. I think it will be a long two to three year slog under the best of circumstances. The reader should note my overall bias though. I believe the Fed will raise rates a bit more, than pause for longer than bulls expect. The economy will not suffer a mild recession, but a large one, and this will propel equities in general down another 50%. Until equities recover, crypto will not. But as my wise father used to say: ""Anything can happen and probably will"". How Can I Benefit from The Bad Prospects? If you concur with this analysis, you have several ways to play this: For one thing, if you own COIN already, but believe in its long term prospects, you could sell today, take your losses, and use the money to buy more shares at the lower value later on. Alternatively, if you own at least 100 shares of COIN, you could sell covered call options against your position to generate premium income until COIN recovers. As I write this, a one year call option on COIN at a strike above today's price, at $35, yields $7.30. That's a 20% yearly return, and goes a long ways to mitigating further losses on the stock. A speculative investment would be to take a short position of COIN stock. That means borrowing the stock from your brokerage in order to immediately sell at today's perceived high value. You hope to gain by buying the shares back at the lower price and pocketing the gain after paying back any related interest costs. If you intend to do this you should be knowledgeable about the risks of shorting a stock. When you short a stock you don't own, you can theoretically lose more money than the original margin required to take on the position That's because a stock price has no upper bound on how high it can go, at least in theory. Before you short a stock like COIN, make sure you fully understand the increased risks. Consider using stops and stop limits but you must weigh the pros and cons of these ( see Seeking Alpha's guide ). Some people think they can use stop losses to protect against a sudden rise. These will not always work, as stocks can jump up 30% to 50% overnight on unexpected news or an unanticipated merger. An alternative approach is to bet on the downside using options. Options can be very risky, if you don't have years of hands-on experience. Make sure you are an expert, or hire a financial advisor for expert guidance. That said, that is the methodology that I prefer. If constructed properly strategies like simple puts, put spreads, calendar calls and broken wing butterfly trades can provide you with trades that limit your loss to a predefined maximum you are willing to risk. That loss occurs if the bearish prediction does not occur in the time or to the extent that you expect. The upside if you are right can be very attractive. I like to put on those trades when I can achieve three to ten times the reward for my money at risk, and when I believe I have a better than 50% chance of being right. Conclusion Investors with a short-term time horizon will want to exit COIN to avoid further pain. More experienced investors should consider short positions or even better, option trades that benefit from a drop. Those deeply underwater but believing in the company will need to wait 3 to 4 years to be rewarded for their patience.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568376-short-coinbase-to-play-altcoin-meldown?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7175529.jpeg

42413222,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl87XM,1673044122,Crypto Markets Today: Huobi Tensions Sink Tron Token Price,"The price of Tron (TRX), the 18th-largest token by market capitalization, tumbled Friday amid tensions at crypto exchange Huobi as the broader crypto market rose.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Tron founder Justin Sun sits on Huobi’s advisory board. The exchange said Friday it will cut its headcount by 20% and require employees to take their salaries in stablecoins. It also closed internal staff communication channels to quell a rebellion, according to reports on Twitter.  TRX fell nearly 8% early Friday before it settled back to a 1.6% loss in the past 24 hours, data showed. The price is above a support level of 5 cents, and if it drops below that, the tokens could slip to as low as 3 cents, price charts show. Huobi’s native HT exchange tokens have lost as much as 11% in the past 24 hours.  The Tron-based stablecoin USDD fell 3 cents, effectively losing its intended peg to the U.S. dollar. Such price action caused the value locked on Tron-based decentralized applications to fall by 2%, DefiLlama data shows.  Futures tracking TRX saw less than $1 million in liquidations on exchanges, suggesting the selling was mostly spot driven. Spot refers to actual tokens, while futures are derivative financial instruments that allow traders to bet on the prices of the underlying tokens.  Meanwhile, security firm PeckShield noted on Twitter that crypto wallet addresses linked to Sun moved over $50 million to crypto exchange Binance.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at the $16,900 level, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours. BTC briefly topped $17,000 in afternoon trading hours (EST). Equities wrapped up Friday’s trading with gains following a strong U.S. jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed up 2.5%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 2.2% and 2.1%, respectively.  Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency followed BTC’s trajectory, trading up 0.9% over the past 24 hours to change hands at around $1,265.  Bonk inu (BONK): Developers behind Solana-based memecoin project Bonk Inu (BONK) burned over 5 trillion tokens, or 5% of the total supply, earlier on Friday, blockchain data showed. The move claimed to have effectively burned all tokens earmarked for developers of the project. The BONK price dropped 36% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko.

Its price change in 24 hours is +$0.006083 representing a 2.17% increase. Also, the 24-hour low of ADA is $0.2681, while its high is $0.27562. The market capitalization has risen by 2.25% to $9.51 billion. It is currently ranked among the top ten cryptocurrencies, according to CoinmarketCap, at number 9. Related Reading: What To Expect As Bitcoin Pictures Bullish Divergence On Chart? The circulating supply is 34.52 billion ADA, with its maximum token supply pegged at 45 billion ADA tokens. ADA has performed well recently since the turn of the year, prompting optimism among holders. With the prolonged crypto winter in 2022, investors are hoping for more favorable market conditions moving forward. Cardano’s recovery has rekindled interest in the project and questions on how long it can sustain the rally. What Is Behind ADA’s Price Upsurge? ADA is enjoying increased adoption since its trading volume has increased. Investors and holders of the coin are more likely to buy into the project due to its utility. Cardano is one of the largest blockchains to use the energy-efficient proof-of-stake network. This proof-of-stake helps in energy saving and environmental protection. Cardano network also supports the creation of smart contracts. These smart contracts facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) on the Cardano network. It is also gaining more attention in Web3 and for gaming applications. With faster transaction times and regular upgrades, it is ideal for technological innovation. Cardano upgrades also undergo thorough research and scrutiny before being released to the public. ADA Price Prediction ADA is trading below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). However, the candlestick formation on the chart shows a possible bullish run in the coming days. A thick green candle on the daily chart indicates sustained bullish pressure and will likely continue in the coming days. ADA’s closest resistance level is $0.329. Other resistance levels are $0.44, 0.595, and $0.777. If the bulls sustain the pressure, it will test the nearest resistance level of $0.329 in the coming days. The support levels of $0.260, $0.262, and $0.265 held and acted as a pivot for the price upsurge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 49.19, in the neutral zone above the oversold region of 40. However, the RSI will probably rise above 49 in the coming days. The Moving Average Convergence, Divergence (MACD) shows neutrality but indicates a possible uptrend. The MACD line falls under the signal line but is positioned upward. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Will Come Out Ahead In A Recession, Top Analyst Claims The price of ADA will record a slight increase in the coming days. However, from the candlestick patterns, many red candles are present. It means that the trend can reverse at any time to a bearish pattern.

Y00ts, a generative art project of 15,000 NFTs, and DeGods, a 10,000-edition digital art collection, were among the top projects built on the Solana blockchain. Last week the team behind the collections announced that they were leaving the Solana network, with DeGods moving to the Ethereum blockchain, and Y00ts moving to Polygon.  A DeGods representative previously told CoinDesk that Polygon had paid for the move with a grant from its partnership fund. On Friday, the project’s leader, Rohun Vora, known as Frank, confirmed the size of the grant was $3 million.  ""DeLabs received a $3M non-equity grant from Polygon to help fund the expansion of the DeLabs team and to kickstart and initially help scale the incubator we are building that will allow you to spend y00tpoints and DePoints to mint our incubator's NFT collections,"" he wrote in the Y00ts Discord channel. Y00tpoints and DePoints are tokens given to holders who stake their NFTs.  Vora went on to explain that the money would be used to expand the DeLabs team across departments such as business development, graphic design, content creation and event coordination. With expanded capital, he added, the startup can ""launch higher quality projects"" and ""provide actually cool partnerships/deals/discounts/perks with real businesses.""  The move dealt a blow to Solana, whose native cryptocurrency, SOL, has continued to drop since its November 2021 high of $258. On Friday, SOL was hovering around $13.  “There’s an argument to be made that [DeGods] has capped out on Solana,” Vora said in a Twitter Spaces announcing the migration last week. In the days leading up to the announcement, sales of DeGods and Y00ts accounted for nearly 70% of all Solana NFT sale volume, according to data from NFT marketplace Magic Eden.

ENS is one of the top domain services in Web3 and has a history of strong participation from token holders in DAO proposals. The coin itself is purely a governance token, lacks utility at the consumer end, and has a large amount of dilution remaining. One of the more interesting crypto tokens to explore this crypto winter might be Ethereum Name Service ( ENS-USD ). It is a domain protocol built on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain. In this article, we'll look at what Ethereum Name Service is, the tokenomics of the coin, and the strength of the Ethereum Name Service DAO. What is Ethereum Name Service? Simply put, Ethereum Name Service is a domain provider built on public blockchain rails. One can think of it a bit like DNS but for a Web3 environment. The service provides public domains on the blockchain similar to how a company like GoDaddy ( GDDY ) would provide dot com domains for more traditional Web companies. In addition to building websites with Web3 domains, domain holders can also use the domain addresses for payment routing and ID verification. For instance, Google ( GOOG ) (GOOGL) or Facebook ( META ) accounts are often used to sign into Web2 websites. In Web3, users can sign into applications using their domain address through a wallet like Metamask. ENS uses the .ETH extension which is potentially problematic because "".eth"" has actually been reserved for the country of Ethiopia by ICANN - the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. While .eth hasn't actually been used by Ethiopia, it is potentially a massive collision problem if Ethiopia and/or ICANN decide to make it a problem for some reason. To be clear, I don't think this is likely, but it is a possibility to consider. Why Get a Web3 Domain? I've previously covered ENS for my BlockChain Reaction subscribers in an NFT deep dive that I did in August. In that piece, I explained why public blockchain ledger allows peer to peer payment no matter which app the end user chooses: It doesn't matter if the user I'm sending it to uses MetaMask, Exodus, Brave, Atomic, Edge or something entirely different. As long as I have the correct wallet address character string, I can send it to that user. The problem with crypto wallet addresses is that they are long strings of characters and confusing to any non-crypto user. One of my base cases for Web3 domains is for payment routing and username logins. Rather than copy/pasting unreadable character strings, users can instead create human readable domains that route transactions to the correct address in any application that has integration with ENS. For instance, if I owned the domain ""mikefay.eth"" (I don't), I could have a friend send me $10 in USDC ( USDC-USD ) to ""mikefay.eth"" to pay for some sort of good or service. The funds would arrive to my Ethereum address that is associated with that domain no matter which wallet application my friend uses. Anyone who has ever used Venmo likely understands the benefit of searchable usernames in a peer to peer payment app. ENS potentially takes the utility of peer to peer payment in something like Venmo or CashApp and decentralizes it at the application layer. It's a very interesting real world solution built on public blockchain. Sales, DAO Structure, and Tokenomics There is plenty of competition in the blockchain domain space. That said, ENS is one of the most successful given the level of domain sales, unique owners, and decentralized governance of the protocol. As of submission, ENS has registered just under 2.6 million domains that are spread out among 596k unique buyers. ENS Market Data (OpenSea) This level of domain sales is comparable to an entity like Unstoppable Domains, but there are key differences. One big difference is Unstoppable domains sells them to the user outright and offers over a half dozen different extension options. While ENS focuses on a single extension and operates with a renewal model that supporters say is more sustainable in the long term. Another key difference is Unstoppable Domains is a private business while ENS has a DAO structure. And it's actually one of the more successful examples of a DAO in my opinion. Rank Organization Treasury Lifetime Participants (sorted) 1 ENS $861m 87.2k 2 GMX N/A 51.8k 3 PancakeSwap $11.1K 49.2k 4 AAVE $97.9m 42.3k 5 Wonderland $239.7m 38.8k Source: DeepDAO According to DeepDAO, ENS has the most lifetime DAO participants with over 87,000 people and it has a top 3 treasury value with $861 million in funds. ENS appears to have a dedicated, loyal base of users and domain holders. Though there are well over a half a million unique domain holders, there are just 64k ENS token holders. Holders: 64,233 Coin Price: $11.27 Total Supply: 100,000,000 Circulating Supply: 20,244,862 Circulating Market Cap: $228 million Cap Rank: #103 The biggest issue to the immediate investment thesis with the ENS coin itself may be the amount of supply dilution that is still coming. ENS Token Top 100 Wallets (etherscan) ENS has a total max supply of 100 million coins and there are still more than 61% of them in time lock waiting to be released. The largest single wallet holder is the DAO treasury with 10%. From there, Binance ( BNB-USD ) and OKX have roughly 7% of the supply. This means out of the 100 million coins, the circulating supply is a little over 20%. That's not a high number and it means there is going to be a significant amount of dilution when the remaining tokens come out of timelock near the end of 2025. Risks If you believe in the future of Web3, Ethereum Name Service is conceivably a community to consider betting on. The problem is potentially with the tokenomics of the ENS coin itself. In addition to the dilution concern, it is not a utility token in any way. Holders of the coin don't get discounts on domain renewals or any perks from holding. The token exists purely as a governance coin. So if you want to vote on the direction of the ENS ecosystem, then it might make sense to consider buying this one. If that's not something you're interested in, you can probably stay away for now. Summary I think ENS is one of the most interesting applications of public blockchain in the entire cryptocurrency market. The activity and dedication from members of the community through DAO voting is exceptional and, in my view, one of the more impressive case studies of decentralized autonomous organizations. I can legitimately say I'm personally rooting for ENS to thrive long term but I can't recommend buying the governance token as an investment right now. All that said, I'm actually incredibly bullish NFT domains long term.",NEUTRAL,ETH | ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ICO | MARKET | ENS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568361-ethereum-name-service-strong-community-weak-investment-case?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7172842.jpeg

Most of the assets have not been impressive in their price movements. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the crypto market has pushed the cumulative market cap to around $812.00 billion. This indicated a drop of 0.88% over the past 24 hours. With the declining market trend, XRP stands among the assets that have lost value. The price dip has attracted crypto whales. They have moved millions of XRP tokens to different crypto exchanges. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Falls, Is It A Wise Idea To Short? Whales Show Interest In XRP According to WhaleAlert, an on-chain data provider, there have been several transactions involving XRP. It recorded that crypto whales have transferred about 385 million XRP to crypto exchanges within 24 hours. The cumulative tokens are worth almost $131 million in the current market prices. The data provider noted that besides the most significant single transaction, many whales had moved about 70 million XRP tokens to several crypto exchanges. The value is worth about $25.6 million. The report indicated that most transfer transactions were on Bitstamp, costing $10.1 million. In addition, one of the whales moved XRP tokens worth about $11.8 million to the Bitso crypto exchange. Also, an unknown crypto whale is reported to have purchased up to 35.1 million XRP tokens. The transaction occurred during this present XRP price dip through the Bitso exchange. As a result, the whale accumulated Ripple tokens worth about $11.8 million. Notably, the largest single transaction from a whale, as recorded by the data provider, involved a transfer of over 280 million XRP tokens. The tokens are worth almost $95.4 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Large Dormant Supply On The Move XRP Token Continues To Plummet Ripple’s native token has not made any unusual movement recently. Instead, XRP has dropped by almost 12% over the past 30 days. During today’s early trading hours, XRP dipped by 3%. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $0.3364. Also, XRP recorded about $691.2 million as its trading volume over the past 24 hours. Its market cap now sits at $16.93 billion, keeping the token at the 6th position in the CoinMarketCap ranking of crypto assets. The price trend for XRP still has some elements of instability and uncertainty. Recall that over the past three days, XRP indicated slight volatility as the price climbed to around $0.35. The coin showed a considerable presence of the bulls through its price movement. However, XRP still couldn’t sustain the reclaimed value as the token fell to the $0.33 level. A recent report disclosed that Ripple’s case with SEC might still last longer. Seven days ago, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse estimated that the lawsuit might run for 3 to 4 months more but should end in Q1 of 2023.

On a relative basis, BTC’s seven-day performance was 18th among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Ether was 12th in the group.  Over the most recent 30 days, BTC and ETH have moved just 0.7% and 0.8% respectively, reflecting the recent, stagnant price action.  The laggard for the week was LEO, which declined 1.6%, while solana (SOL) led the way with a 34.5% price increase.  An Improved range of price action within the basket of currencies highlighted the week. Where on Dec 16, performance ranged between 30.6% and -15.4%, this week’s range spans 34.5% and -1.6%.  Crypto screen of the day  Despite ETH’s middling performance over the last seven days, the second largest crypto in market value breached the upper range of its Bollinger bands on Friday.  Another coin of note making an appearance on the Bollinger Band screen is Binance coin (BNB). The BNB token garnered attention recently when it failed to win a listing on any major U.S. crypto exchanges, except for Binance.US.  Bollinger bands are a technical indicator that measures an asset’s moving average (often the 20-day), and calculates two standard deviations above and below that price.  Statistically, prices are expected to stay within two standard deviations approximately 95% of the time. Prices moving past the upper Bollinger Band range are often bullish indicators.  CoinDesk Market Index sector performance  Week-to-date performance among CoinDesk’s CMI sectors shows the CoinDesk Culture and Entertainment (CNE) sector leading the way, with the CoinDesk Currency sector (CCY) as the laggard.  The CNE Index, meant to track the performance of assets found within the gaming, metaverse and virtual world sphere, includes the following notable assets: Apecoin (APE), Axie Infinity (AXS), Chilliz (CHZ), Decentraland (MANA), The Sandbox (SAND).

The big economic event of the day was supposed to be the Nonfarm Payrolls reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) at 8:30 a.m. ET, but the rally really kicked off 90 minutes later after the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index (also known as ISM services) for December fell sharply to 49.6 from 56.5 previously. Any number below 50 for this gauge suggests economic contraction, and it was the first time the services index dipped below 50 since May 2020. Digging deeper into the December report shows the New Orders subindex – considered a leading indicator – tumbling all the way to 45.2 from 56 previously.  Earlier this week, the ISM Manufacturing Index for December came in at 48.4 for its second consecutive month in contraction territory.  The headline numbers in the December jobs report from the BLS beat expectations, with jobs added of 223,000 versus forecasts for 200,000, and the unemployment rate of 3.5% versus forecasts for 3.7%. That 223,000 job gain, though, was a sizable slowdown from the 300,000-plus prints regularly seen in the first half of 2022 and was the lowest number of jobs added since April 2021.  In addition, wage growth was softer than anticipated, with average hourly earnings up 0.3% in December against forecasts for 0.4%. Year over year, wages were up 4.6% versus forecasts for 5.0%.  Stock and bond prices began taking off just after the ISM report and haven't looked back. A few minutes before the close, the Nasdaq is higher by nearly 3% and the 10-year bond yield has plunged 16 basis points to 3.56%. Aggressive with rate hikes through most of 2022, the Fed in December backed off just a bit, lifting its benchmark Fed Funds rate just 50 basis points as opposed to the previous 75 basis point moves. Traders are now upping bets that the U.S. central bank might raise rates just 25 basis points at its next monetary policy meeting in February.  The rally in bitcoin took a bit longer to get going on Friday and hasn't been as dramatic, but the crypto did manage to hit $17,000 for the first time in three weeks. Alongside the many issues facing bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency industry, maybe the most major headwind to prices has been the aggressive Fed.

FTX Trading, which is the entity behind the FTX.com exchange, filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. in November, while FTX Digital Markets, a Bahamas-based entity, entered liquidation proceedings the same month. The joint provisional liquidators (JPL) in the Bahamas and FTX Trading's U.S. leadership had butted heads over the past few weeks, alleging interference with their respective proceedings and arguing over jurisdictional issues. FTX, which has dozens of subsidiaries and related entities, launched a complex bankruptcy case when it filed, with branches in numerous countries. The U.S. and the Bahamas have taken the lead on actually working through the bankruptcy process so far.  Attorneys representing FTX Trading told a U.S. bankruptcy court judge that he should not allow the liquidators to access FTX's Amazon and Google cloud services or other IT tools.  ""We simply don't trust that the JPLs will be able to hold this information and not provide it to the Bahamian government,” Sullivan and Cromwell attorney James Bromley said a month ago. “The Securities Commission of the Bahamas has already collaborated with the JPLs to obtain access to digital assets and to mint tokens.”  For its part, the Bahamas government and the liquidators have taken issue with how Ray and his team in the U.S. have handled the bankruptcy as well, saying the claim about minting tokens is inaccurate and even pushing back against the U.S. bankruptcy proceedings entirely.  The two sides have even had disagreements about the value of the assets held by the Bahamas. Last month, the Securities Commission of the Bahamas announced it had secured about $3.5 billion worth of FTX customer assets, which FTX Trading said was a misleading figure. The commission fired back this week, calling FTX's figure a ""material misstatement.""  In Friday's statement, FTX CEO John Ray III said the joint provisional liquidators had ""constructive meetings"" with his team in Miami this week.  ""There are some issues where we do not yet have a meeting of the minds, but we resolved many of the outstanding matters and have a path forward to resolve the rest,"" he said.  Brian Simms, one of the liquidators, likewise said he ""looked forward"" to working with the U.S. bankruptcy managers.  According to the release, the parties will ""work together to share information, secure and return property to their estates, coordinate litigation against third parties and explore strategic alternatives for maximizing stakeholder recoveries.""  FTX Trading will be involved in the Bahamas liquidation proceedings and FTX Digital Markets will be involved in the U.S. bankruptcy cases, the statement said.  The liquidators will take charge of disposing of real estate tied to FTX, but both the U.S. bankruptcy court and Bahamas Supreme Court will oversee this process. Both courts will also be involved in confirming ""the inventory of digital assets"" controlled by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas.  Both courts have to sign off on the cooperation agreement, the statement said. A bankruptcy court in Delaware was supposed to hold a hearing addressing some of these jurisdictional issues on Friday morning, but the hearing had been pushed to Jan. 13.

High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would send direct payments of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, to people to pay for things like rent, food and heat.  “Speed is of the essence in humanitarian action,” Karolina Lindholm Billing, the UNHCR representative to Ukraine, said in a statement announcing the move. “It’s also essential to provide people with a range of options for receiving aid, as one size does not fit all.” The plan requires people to download a smartphone-based wallet, called Vibrant, and redeem the payments sent via the Stellar blockchain for euros, dollars or Ukrainian hryvnias at one of 4,500 MoneyGram locations.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The move is being heralded by many as a way to leverage technological advancements to benefit those truly in need. Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation, Oleksandr Bornyakov, who has been supportive of several crypto-based humanitarian initiatives, said the project “will serve as a possible lifeline for survival.”  It follows nearly six months of smaller-scale experimentation co-run with the Stellar Development Foundation. Crypto, the foundation said, is a way to bolster humanitarian aid projects typically limited by geographical constraints. But it also comes at a time when blockchain technology – particularly stablecoins – is being reevaluated amid months of collapsing prices and consumer carnage.  To some extent, the crypto industry has been lucky that its year-long contagion event spurred by bad debt and self-dealing did not spread out into the wider economy. Billions in dollars of capital have been liquidated, but by and large the effects have been borne by internal players.  Stablecoins, by their very nature, are attempts at linking the wider crypto economy to the real world. And it’s partially this relationship that is driving fears around the stability of the asset class. Stablecoins are already being used for myriad economic activities, and could likely find adoption anywhere dollar bills are spent.  In a series of recent papers, economists have looked at stablecoins’ external connections to the banking and other commercial sectors and have found things to worry about. Yet, many also note the advantages stablecoins can play in an increasingly digital world. The pace of adoption and experimentation is only likely to continue – raising the question of how exactly stablecoins should be regulated, governed and integrated.  Crypto often sets the goal of “mass adoption,” becoming the basic infrastructure for economic and other activities. This, to me, seems misguided while the kinks of the technology are still being worked out. Especially in the realm of stablecoins, it seems like mastering the world of fully-transparent, self-sovereign and censorship-resistant transactions needs to come first – an area of economic activity that is almost by definition fringe.  In a recent paper, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) argued that fintechs (including Bitcoin and other crypto players) have had limited penetration disrupting remittances – a sector known for being inefficient, opaque and outdated. Instead of supplanting incumbent remittance providers – like MoneyGram – the IMF found, contrary to expectations, that fintechs have become increasingly entangled.  “Therefore, not only there is no evidence of disruption, but it is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future,” economist Tito Nicias Teixeira da Silva Filho wrote in the December paper, titled “Curb Your Enthusiasm: The Fintech Hype Meets Reality in the Remittances Market.” Still, the paper noted that fitechs and crypto are bringing competition to the sector, helping to drive down costs.  The challenge in many markets is that most of the people who could benefit most from digitization still transact primarily in cash. Perhaps unpredictably, the agency also argued that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could succeed where fintech, stablecoins and bitcoin failed, though likely only in markets where there is low digital adoption.  This tracks recent comments from a former official of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), who told Caixin he’s been unimpressed with adoption of the so-called e-CNT. In particular, the country’s CBDC pilot has seen a marginal uptick in volumes despite the system’s privileged use during the 2022 Olympic games.  See also: Stablecoins and CBDCs: Private Vs. Public Monetary Innovation | Opinion  Xie Ping, now a professor at Tsinghua University, said the e-CNY is often thought of as a cash substitute in a country where third-party payments systems including WeChat Pay, Alipay and QQ Wallet already have broad market penetration. These platforms, sometimes called superapps, include a multitude of messaging and social media platforms – as well as the ability to perform additional financial services like lending and loans.  The extent to which stablecoins and CBDCs will actually compete is still an open questions. It seems every month there’s a new paper arguing how stablecoins present untenable risks to the existing banking system, only to be contradicted by another paper. The same points are raised also about CBDCs. It’s likely, as evidenced by the spectrum already in existence, there’s room for multiple payment systems – and that, if anything, the kaleidoscope of options targeting specific needs will only increase.  Risks, rewards  In December, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (FRB) studied the “lifecycle” of stablecoins from issuance to redemption. In a broad overview, the researchers found that stablecoins carry varying risks depending on their stabilization mechanisms.  Putting aside algorithmic stablecoins, the FRB was particularly concerned with tokens that are managed by private issues – the arrangement of the two largest stablecoins by market cap and volume, USDT and USDC. These coins are supposed to be backed by liquid investments, meaning that every token issued has money in the bank to be withdrawn when tokens are redeemed.  Following a report by the Wall Street Journal into Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin by market capitalization and volume, pledged to stop lending out its reserves that back its USDT token. By the end of 2023, Tether claims it will reduce secured loans in its reserves to zero – thereby protecting an asset it says is already over-collateralized.  This comes after the company also pledged to shed its “commercial paper,” which many suspected referred to risky investments in China’s housing market. Tether’s moves here to limit risks to its collateral should be praised. In any payment system design there will be a series of tradeoffs to make.  In CBDCs, for instance, which depending on the design are digital forms of “public money” as already understood, there are a series of constraints designers have to account for. The European Central Bank essentially teased out the dichotomy between building a CBDC for broad adoption and for meeting a central bank’s policy goals.  See also: What CBDCs Mean for the Future of DeFi and Stablecoins | Opinion  Finally, the Bank of Canada published a discussion paper about stablecoin utility for retail payments, finding that these systems often facilitate greater transaction speeds and consumer privacy. But, lacking regulation, stablecoins also present greater risk for fraud as well as diminish the ability for regulators to combat financial crimes.  “The paper’s findings suggest that stablecoin arrangements do not currently serve as substitutes for the suite of traditional payment arrangements but instead address niche use cases or user segments that value their benefits and can accept their risks or costs,” economist John Kiff wrote in a summary.

42413209,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl87N4,1673031740,Brother of Criminal Bitcoin Mixing CEO Pleads Guilty to Stealing 712 Bitcoins From IRS,"An Ohio family now has not one but two felons facing potentially lengthy prison sentences for crypto-related crimes.  Cleveland man Gary Harmon, 31, pleaded guilty to one count each of wire fraud and obstruction of justice on Friday for stealing 712 bitcoins from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The bitcoins had been seized by law enforcement from Harmon’s older brother, Larry Harmon – the CEO of darknet crypto mixing service Helix – after his 2020 arrest.  Larry Harmon pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in August 2021. He was ordered to pay a $60 million civil penalty by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The elder Harmon has not yet been sentenced – as part of his plea agreement, he was required to forfeit his ill-gotten gains as well as turn government informant. According to his lawyers, his cooperation is “active and ongoing.”  But while Larry was cooperating with the government, his younger brother – who was formerly employed by one of Larry’s companies, Coin Ninja – was stealing from it, pilfering crypto from Larry’s forfeited wallets.  According to a newly released memorandum filed by prosecutors in August 2021, Gary Harmon used recovery seed words to recreate numerous wallets that belonged to his brother. In April 2020, he made a series of eight transfers from Larry’s forfeited wallets – Trezor wallets being held in an IRS storage locker – to his own wallets. In total, the younger Harmon brother purloined a total of 712 bitcoins from the IRS – at the time, worth $5.4 million.  Prosecutors said that Gary initially vehemently denied draining his brother’s wallets, even when presented with evidence that he had done so.  Rags to riches  Prior to stealing the 712 bitcoin, prosecutors said Gary “was on unemployment and lived a modest lifestyle,” after being laid off from Coin Ninja after his brother’s arrest in 2020.  In Feb. 2020, Gary told CoinDesk in an interview that Larry’s frozen assets had forced the family to create a GoFundMe campaign for its expenses during the trial (the GoFundMe has since been deleted).  After gaining access to his brother’s wallets, the newly flush Gary took out a $1.2 million loan through BlockFi, using bitcoin as collateral, to purchase a luxury condo in Cleveland.  He also “spent bitcoin extravagantly” at strip clubs and on private jet flights. Photos recovered from his cell phone show a lavish evening out at a club: Gary bathing in a tub full of cash, a blissful smile on his face as scantily clad dancers mingle behind him. A text reveals that Gary paid $122,232 for the privilege of swimming in the pool of 100,000 one-dollar bills surrounded by the dancers. The massive bill included $15,000 for a “dancer fee” and $25,000 for the room.  In July 2021, federal agents arrested Gary Harmon and searched his Ohio residence. They found wallets containing approximately $6,000 in bitcoin.  As part of his plea agreement, Gary Harmon agreed to the forfeiture of more than $12 million in crypto, including 647 bitcoins, 2 ether and 17.4 million dogecoin.

Bitcoin 30-Day MA Exchange Depositing Transactions Have Declined As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the metric’s current levels are the same as in Q1 2019. The “exchange depositing transactions” is an indicator that measures the total number of Bitcoin transfers that are headed toward centralized exchanges. The difference between this metric and the more popular exchange inflow is that the latter indicator tells us the total amount of BTC being deposited to exchanges, that is, the combined sum of the value of each transaction going to exchanges (rather than their total number), which is a value that can be inflated by a few whales and are thus not representative of the trend being followed by the entire market (especially the retail investors). But since the exchange depositing transactions only focus on the pure number of individual transfers taking place rather than their amounts, the metric could give a more accurate picture regarding whether the average investor is sending coins to exchanges or not at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Large Dormant Supply On The Move Since one of the main reasons holders deposit to exchanges is for selling purposes, a high value of this indicator can have bearish implications for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, low values imply not many investors are applying selling pressure right now. The below chart shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin exchange depositing transactions over the last several years: The 30-day MA value of the metric seems to have been pretty low in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin exchange depositing transactions have declined for quite a while and have recently hit pretty low values.

This means that the appetite for depositing coins to exchanges, and thus for selling BTC, is at historically low levels. This could suggest that the selling pressure may have become exhausted in the market now, and the bottom could be near, if not already, for the current BTC cycle. However, the quant in the post also notes that the bottoming process being possibly here doesn’t discount the possibility that there could still be a final downward push left for Bitcoin.

This downward move on the Bitcoin chart could be attributed to the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. The minutes of the meetings revealed that the Federal Reserve System would stick with higher interest rates for the foreseeable future. This has evidently sent ripples through the market, causing participants to react negatively. The technical outlook of the asset has reflected a fall in accumulation, but indicators are still positive about the Bitcoin price over the upcoming trading sessions. From the daily chart, it can be inferred that BTC will make a recovery in the next trading sessions. Bitcoin continues to hold itself steady above the $16,600 price mark. Currently, the price of the asset is consolidated, with major altcoins following the same price trajectory. Over the last 24 hours, BTC slipped 0.6%. The Bitcoin price at the moment is trading at a 76% discount from its all-time high of 2021. The market capitalization of Bitcoin decreased slightly, indicating that sellers outnumbered buyers at press time. Related Reading: Binance Acquisition Moves See BNB Riding A Wave of Enthusiasm Bitcoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart BTC was trading at $16,700 at the time of writing. The coin recently lost the $16,800 support level; however, this is extremely short-term as BTC will soon initiate recovery on the chart. A slight push from the buyers will help BTC propel itself above the $16,800 mark, which indicates that the overhead resistance for the coin stood at $16,900. Clearing the $16,900 price mark will pave the way up to $17,000. On the other hand, if demand doesn’t show up immediately, BTC could retrace further to sit at $16,600 before it starts to move northward again. The amount of BTC traded in the last session declined to indicate slight bearishness. Technical Analysis Despite a fall in the number of buyers, the technical outlook has managed to remain positive for Bitcoin price. The Relative Strength Index noted a downtick, which indicated that buyers were slowly exiting the market. On the other hand, however, Bitcoin has displayed a positive sign on the daily chart. The price of the asset was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), which meant that buyers still had the upper hand in driving the price momentum in the market. Additionally, the 50-SMA (yellow) was below the 20-SMA (red) line; this is a golden cross, a pattern that is formed before the coin starts a rally. In accordance with incoming bullish strength, Bitcoin price depicted a buy signal on the daily chart. The price momentum is indicated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which showed green signal bars.

The company maintains the largest Bitcoin stash on its balance sheet on Wall Street and may perform wonderfully during the next crypto bull run. Ignore the haters who don't understand Bitcoin and hold through the crypto winter. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is my favorite long-term Bitcoin (BTC-USD) crypto stock because the company holds an enormous amount of BTC on its balance sheet. The company made headlines when it decided to sell some of its Bitcoin at a loss to reduce its capital gains just before the end of 2022. This is a similar strategy to tax loss harvesting that lots of investors use to reduce their capital gains tax bill. I'm noticing a lot of haters attacking Bitcoin and calling it worthless despite the fact that Bitcoin is still up over 2,700% over the last 10 years. Data by YCharts Bitcoin has greatly outperformed both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ over the last 10 years but haters continue to call Bitcoin ""worthless"". Data by YCharts The charts don't lie and anyone can see that Bitcoin was a far better investment over the last 10 years than most stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds. MicroStrategy understands that Bitcoin will become the most important asset of the 21st century and it's nice to see them HODL despite all of the negative news surrounding crypto. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Sale Explained I touched on this topic in the introduction but some investors may not understand exactly why MicroStrategy sold some of its Bitcoin to buy it right back. According to CoinDesk , MicroStrategy has accumulated 2,500 BTC over the last few months during the crypto bear market. However, the company decided to sell 780 BTC to offset capital gains. Even though Bitcoin is not regulated by the SEC or government, investors are required by law to pay taxes on any capital gains made from Bitcoin purchases. If you want to reduce your capital gains then simply HODL Bitcoin and do not sell for a profit. However, MicroStrategy took advantage of the current bear market to sell at a loss while accumulating more Bitcoin in the process. This is another brilliant move by the company to increase its holdings while decreasing its corporate tax bill. Michael Saylor Understands Bitcoin is Crucial to the Future of Finance When Executive Chairman Michael Saylor stepped down as CEO of MicroStrategy, he wanted to focus all of his efforts on Bitcoin instead of managing everything within the company. The ability to store one's financial energy on a decentralized blockchain that isn't controlled by one central bank or government carries enormous long-term value. That's why MicroStrategy is buying Bitcoin before everyone else understands its intrinsic value. MSTR Stock Trades Below the Value of Bitcoin on its Balance Sheet From a fundamental standpoint, MicroStrategy is in a good financial position despite all of the naysayers. The company holds 132,500 BTC worth ~$2.2 billion at current market prices and carries little risk of being margin called on its Bitcoin backed loans . MSTR stock currently trades at $1.6 billion market cap, which is around $600 million below the total value of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The company does still carry nearly $2.45 billion in debt but almost half of that is in the form of convertible bonds that mature in 2027 . My guess is that MSTR stock will trade much higher over the next 4 years as long as Bitcoin moves higher over the long term. With only 9.37 million shares outstanding, I don't think these convertible bonds will cause too much dilution. Risk Factors My biggest concern is that MicroStrategy changes its stance on Bitcoin and offloads its holdings. That's the only reason I hold MSTR shares in the first place. The company could sell some Bitcoin over time if it needs to but Michael Saylor seems extremely bullish on blockchain technology in the long run. Another issue is that Bitcoin collapses altogether or another technology replaces it. Too many haters attack Bitcoin for not being a tangible asset like real estate or gold. What's Next for MicroStrategy? MSTR trades at a Prices to Sales ratio of under 4. That's a big discount from its P/S ratio over the last 52 weeks. Data by YCharts Bitcoin is approaching the next halving cycle in 2024, and I will continue to hold my MSTR shares in my SEP IRA. If you have been holding MSTR stock through the crypto bear market, then you are obviously bullish on Bitcoin in the long run.

42413224,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl87ZE,1673026526,'Binance Effect' Means 41% Price Spike for Newly Listed Tokens,"Token prices spike 73% in the first 30 days following their listing on crypto exchange Binance, an analysis by crypto investor Ren & Heinrich has found.  The report, which tracked 26 coins over 18 months, showed a 41% increase a day after a listing on the world’s largest crypto exchange by market volume and 24% gain on day three. Ren & Heinrich’s findings offer evidence of a “Binance effect” that benefits tokens at least for the short term and resembles a similar “Coinbase effect,” a term first conceived in 2021 to account for price bumps that occurred soon after listings on that popular exchange.  A study in April 2021 by crypto-analysis firm Messari found that token listings on Coinbase led to a 91% price jump in the first five days of trading.  This week's study by Ren & Heinrich suggests that Binance's emergence as the dominant global crypto exchange might mean that its individual token listings are now getting a lot more attention – at least among speculators.  “In most cases, a Binance listing does have a positive impact on a cryptocurrency's price,” Ren & Heinrich wrote.  A “Binance effect” appears to be a byproduct of the exchange’s massive trading volume, which far exceeds its competitors. On Thursday, the exchange’s nearly $7.5 billion in trading volume was about triple that of any other exchange.  Roberto Talamas, data science and analytics manager at Messari, said in general, the effect reflects an exchange’s “easy-to-use UX” that provides a simple gateway for crypto natives and non-crypto natives to purchase a token as well as the platform's liquidity.  While among major exchanges only Coinbase listings had a statistically significant effect on price right after listing back in early 2021, “now that liquidity has concentrated more into Binance's exchange, it's possible their asset listing will have a higher effect on price,” Talamas told CoinDesk in an email.  Ren & Heinrich found that the average maximum price in the 30 days after the token listing was 73% higher than on the day of the first Binance listing.  ​Cross-chain bridge protocol Stargate Finance, for instance, saw its native token STG’s price surge 152% – from roughly 33 cents to over 80 cents – on the first day of its listing on Aug. 19, 2022, according to CoinGecko data.  Despite the immediate price jump, Ren & Heinrich said the positive momentum is ""relatively short-lived."" After about two weeks, almost half of all analyzed cryptocurrencies had lost their gains. The analysis also noted that coins listed in the last bull market performed better than coins listed during the current bear market.  Binance effect vs. Coinbase effect  Messari’s Talamas attributed the Binance bump to the same easier “accessibility” for retail investors that drove the “Coinbase effect.”  “There is an argument to be made that if Binance manages to capture the users and funds from other centralized exchanges, and their liquidity and users increase, the bigger the effect becomes on prices from new listings,” Talamas said.  Grzegorz Drozdz, a market analyst at financial-services firm Conotoxia, estimated that in 2022 the price of around two-thirds of all newly launched tokens rose on Binance. The price of optimism (OP), for example, skyrocketed by more than 300% shortly after its debut on Binance.  “It seems that we could expect a greater upward reaction after the Binance listing in 2023, confirming the transition from the 'Coinbase effect' to the 'Binance effect,'” he added.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/06/binance-effect-means-41-price-spike-for-newly-listed-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4185ca45cb12badfc80e60d37ffa2cf3023c5d8c-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410862,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsCTa,1673026264,How Smart TVs Could Help the Metaverse Crack the Mass Market,"LAS VEGAS — Is Web3 ready for prime time?  Some of the televisions unveiled this week at the annual CES trade show purportedly make accessing metaverse worlds or non-fungible token (NFT) wallets as easy as clicking the remote, escalating a long-running race among manufacturers to produce the screens with the most bells and whistles.  In addition to the usual streaming apps and voice-control capabilities, over the past year a few manufacturers – notably Samsung and LG – have added Web3 features such as NFT marketplaces and metaverse platform integrations to their internet-connected “smart” TVs. These moves represent a bid to ensure their sets appeal to a tech-savvy and, in the long term, potentially influential customer base.  From the other side, Web3 companies see smart TVs as a possible path to reaching a mass audience. Samsung and LG are the top two TV makers in the world by market share, and these days you can’t throw a rock in a TV showroom without shattering the screen of a so-called “smart” model.  After unveiling an NFT marketplace on its smart TVs in September, LG this week announced an upgrade to the feature: Its TVs now support Blade Wallet. (They previously used only LG’s proprietary wallet, Wallypto.)  Blade is part of the Hedera ecosystem, the same blockchain powering LG’s marketplace. Why does LG have a thing for Hedera, instead of, say, Ethereum, which holds the lion’s share of NFT activity? Hedera is backed by a coalition of a few dozen companies, including LG, video-game publisher Ubisoft, Google and others. Even though NFT platforms on Hedera are tiny compared with major services like OpenSea and Nifty, the blockchain prioritizes security and energy efficiency, which is probably why it was attractive to a mainstream brand like LG.  Bringing the metaverse to smart TVs  At CES 2023, Samsung and LG announced upgrades to their NFT wallets (Samsung’s marketplace now offers NFTs at 8K resolution, according to The Verge). So far, few other manufacturers have bitten into the NFT pie. That’s probably not surprising, given the carnage in the NFT and crypto markets this past year.  Another factor: Most other big TV brands compete on value, which often means cutting features they consider extraneous. Until huge swaths of customers start demanding easier access to NFTs on their TVs, the feature likely won’t spread very far.  Such demand, though, might come from another place: the metaverse. While the conversation around metaverse hardware tends to be dominated by virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), smart TVs represent a way for users to easily “browse” metaverse worlds the same way they would surf channels.  At least that appears to be the impetus behind another LG move into Web3: Oorbit, billed as a “doorway to 3D interactive worlds,” will be integrated into the South Korean giant’s 2023 smart TVs as well. Users will be able to port the same on-chain digital identity between virtual worlds (apps) and items from one world could be transferable and usable in another.  That’s a tangible step toward a mass-market metaverse that even a roomful of high-end VR headsets can’t match. It’s also one of the only meaningful developments in a consumer metaverse to come from CES, which has mostly zoomed in tight on hardware or way, way out on the big, visionary (and, if we’re being honest, nebulous) concept of taking your digital identity or “self” across different experiences.  What’s missing is the bridge between the two: the things that connect the big vision with the devices we all use. Certainly, the metaverse is well-suited for virtual reality, but for all the technology’s technical wizardry, the market remains tiny when stacked against major tech categories like TVs (11.2 million VR/AR headsets shipped worldwide in 2021, compared with 217 million TVs). If even a small subset of TV buyers choose to dabble in the metaverse, it could be meaningful in advancing – maybe even accelerating – adoption.  Certainly, no one buys a TV for its links to the metaverse, and so any success depends on whether the experiences on offer are as enticing to digital passers-by as the conventional shows the screen was built for.  When thought of in that context, Orbit’s partnership with LG isn’t so much a stake in the ground for the metaverse as its biggest, shiniest billboard.  Which feels very apt, given it was announced in Vegas.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | AR,Pete Pachal,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/06/how-smart-tvs-could-help-the-metaverse-crack-the-mass-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/104267514434bb200292a2d81d738ae6f81a9534-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Being a digital currency driven by purely social sentiment, this was expected to happen, just like it did with predecessors such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. This drawdown in price has also seen the price surge recorded in Solana over the last week slow down significantly.

As such, it could be wise to get out of the cryptocurrency now if the losses were to continue for the next few days. But it is also important to take into account the growth of the meme coin, as well as the attention it is receiving in the market. For example, BONK remains one of the most visited pages on Coinmarketcap. It is second only to RichQUACK, another meme coin that has not done well in the last week. What this shows is that there are still a lot of eyes on the cryptocurrency, which could give it a leg up.

42413216,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl87UY,1673019546,"Singapore Arbitrator Rules Against Mining Software Firm Poolin’s IOU Model, But the Firm Hasn't Paid Yet","An independent arbitrator in Singapore has ordered embattled crypto mining software firm Poolin to return 88 bitcoins (BTC), worth about $1.5 million at recent prices, to a customer whose withdrawals were halted and crypto turned into I-owe-you (IOU) tokens.  Poolin Wallet said on Sept. 5 in a Medium blog post that it was experiencing a liquidity crunch, meaning it didn’t have assets immediately available that customers could withdraw. The firm thus officially paused withdrawals in early September and told customers that their funds would be converted to IOU tokens, which could be converted back to crypto quarterly.  But, on Tuesday, Poolin CEO Kevin Pan told CoinDesk that the IOU payouts haven't been issued yet because the company’s cash flow is “still low.”  Li Bei, the claimant in the Singapore case, said in an arbitration filing that the move broke Poolin’s obligations according to its terms of service – and managed to find justice in arbitration.  David Kreider, the arbitrator, ruled in October that Poolin had to return some of the user’s funds immediately, though the order still needs to be approved by an arbitration tribunal, according to the document, which CoinDesk reviewed.  Pan confirmed the arbitration order to CoinDesk via Telegram in December. “We’re working on it [paying the user back],” he said. The CEO expects his firm will be able to pay Li during the first half of this year, depending on Poolin's cash flow and the market. The arbitrator said Poolin should pay soon.  In August, just before the turbulence was made public, Poolin’s mining pool had about 10% of the hashrate – a measure of computing power – of the entire Bitcoin network, data from BTC.com’s website shows. Its share is now 2.63%.  Poolin has distributed at least another $238 million of such IOUs, according to Nansen analyst Andrew Thurman and independent journalist Colin Wu. Holders of those tokens could in theory claim that Poolin didn’t fulfill its obligations as a service provider, exacerbating the firm’s existing problems.  In early December, Poolin said that some balances would be paid out later in the month. But angry customers who have yet to see any funds have accumulated in the company’s Telegram support channels, with some saying they should “hunt” the “thieving” CEO. Pan didn’t respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on that.  The company has said it expects to pay out all balances in one to two years, as only 10%-20% of each account balance will be paid out per quarter.  On Dec. 22, Poolin said that it was terminating its Mars Project, a hashrate token project that received investment from now-bankrupt Singapore hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, to focus on IOU tokens.  The arbitration case  Li had 101,236.83 USD coin (USDC), 101,985.20604947 tether (USDT) and 88.15571 BTC in Poolin’s Wallet service on July 15, according to the emergency arbitration document seen by CoinDesk. He was unable to withdraw the tokens on that day when he tried.  On Sept. 13, Poolin announced it would be converting all users’ balance to IOUs in order to deal with its liquidity issues. The IOUs could be traded for other cryptocurrencies every quarter on a 1-to-1 basis or swapped for Poolin services.  The firm had originally said on Sept. 13: “In practice, PoolinWallet will offer IOU-token to token single-direction swap in the Trade function, allowing users to trade their IOUBTC to BTC, IOUETH to ETH, IOUUSDT to either USDT or USDC, IOULTC to LTC, IOUZEC to ZEC, IOUDoge to Doge, quarterly. Also, PoolinWallet is likely to increase the frequency and amount of redeem as long as the liquidity becomes available, meanwhile, users could withdraw their IOU tokens and trade on chain or even with third parties (if available) freely.”  On Sept. 19, Li found that, without his approval, his tokens were changed to equivalent IOUs of each cryptocurrency.  Not only was that a violation of the terms of service, but the IOU tokens have virtually no value, because they cannot be traded on exchanges and their price is not tracked by information platforms like CoinMarketCap, Li argued. He said he was stonewalled by Poolin CEO Pan when he tried to get answers.  Poolin has said that IOUs can be exchanged for mining machines. But according to Li, the ones the firm was offering were immersion or hydro-cooled, a technology that is not friendly to home miners. The mining firm was also offering Poolin equity in exchange for IOUs, but that isn't ""worth much,"" Li said.  Separation of companies  On top of that, during the arbitration procedure, Poolin tried to tamper with evidence to throw out the case, according to the arbitration document. The software firm argued that Singapore was the wrong jurisdiction, because the terms of service aren't issued by its local entity, Poolin Technology Pte. The name of the local entity disappeared from Poolin Wallet’s website and app sometime between Sept. 19 and 24, Li said.  While Kreider didn’t rule on the issue of evidence tampering, he seemed to throw his weight behind the allegation, saying that the evidence warrants an emergency order.  Joshua Vazquez, a user who transferred funds from the pool balance to the wallet once it became impossible to do anything else with them on Sept. 13 – the date Poolin announced the IOU plan – said he was deleted from Poolin’s Telegram group for asking questions.  “The Poolin community admins refuse to respond to any questions remotely related to their interactions with Poolin Wallet, and further claim that they are separate entities,” Vazquez told CoinDesk.  Pan didn't respond to a request for comment on the allegations of evidence tampering or Vazquez's claims.",NEGATIVE,BTC | USDT,ASIA | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | USDT,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/06/singapore-arbitrator-rules-against-mining-software-firm-poolins-iou-model-but-the-firm-hasnt-paid-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11e3dd3bb7bac275a12e2d109ba0a79305fd88f7-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following a rejection from a critical resistance zone, the cryptocurrency returned to its range and could be gearing up for a re-test of support. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Falls, Is It A Wise Idea To Short? In the meantime, altcoins are blooming, with many recording profits on high timeframes. As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $16,700 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, BTC records similar price action. BTC In The Short Term, What’s Driving The Price Action? Bitcoin is reacting to macroeconomic developments and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy in the short term. As NewsBTC reported yesterday, investors are hesitant to trade in any direction due to uncertainty around global markets. The situation is likely to persist during January. Today the U.S. released new economic data, but with “mixed” results, according to a pseudonym analyst: Economic Data a bit mixed. More jobs than expected but lower hourly earnings which is the second most important number I’d say. The matter in which the market will digest this is the most telling factor in my opinion. The unemployment rate in the United States printed 3.5% for December 2022, which came much lower than the market expected. The Fed uses this metric to gauge the efficacy of its monetary policy. The higher unemployment, the more they can tame inflation, but the U.S. job market has been resilient and has remained strong despite the Fed’s intentions. In that sense, Bitcoin and risk-on assets reacted with small losses. The lower-than-expected results in unemployment provide room for the Fed to continue tightening. However, the risk of an economic recession increases as the financial institution pushes on to bring down inflation. Bitcoin Will Make It During A Recession? In a recessionary economic scenario, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Macro Strategy, Mike McGlone, believes Bitcoin will thrive. The analyst is bullish on BTC for the long term but shared some reservations about its immediate future. McGlone expects Bitcoin to revisit critical support at around $10,000 to $12,000 in an economic recession. This massive crash will ripple across the nascent industry and operate as the final catalyzer for another rally. The analyst said: The rising potential for a severe global economic slowdown may be a top crypto performance factor in 20222. Out bias is that Bitcoin is more likely to come out ahead in most scenarios (…).

42411266,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMa2y,1673017800,Solana vs. Polygon: A Developer’s Perspective,"I’ve been working on consumer products for about a decade, having contributed to teams that have built and scaled apps to hundreds of millions of users. For the last six years I’ve been 100% focused on crypto. A large part of that has been working on scaling solutions for large-scale, consumer-crypto products.  I’ve been part of teams that have built and launched products on Ethereum, Stellar and Solana, and have evaluated most of the other major blockchains and layer 2 scaling options, which has included spinning up basic proof-of-concepts. In particular, I’ve looked deeply at the benefits and tradeoffs of Polygon – the dominant scaling option for Ethereum today.  Tanner Philp is a senior blockchain developer and currently the head of operations and go-to-market for Code, an upcoming self-custodial crypto wallet app built on Solana.  Web2 developers planning to jump into Web3 often wonder which blockchain they should start with. Most of these discussions end up focusing on Solana and Polygon. It’s a debate that’s only grown more heated in the weeks since Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading empire collapsed, given he was one of Solana’s most prominent supporters.  Although many see the downfall of FTX as a potential death knell to Solana, the network remains a promising technological solution to blockchain’s scaling issues. Even Ethereum co-creater Vitalik Buterin has noted the strength and gumption of developers building on Solana. And, developer activity is one of the best leading indicators of value creation over time.  Given this, I thought it would be helpful to share my perspective as someone experienced in different crypto networks on the pros and cons of Solana and Polygon. Note: This article primarily focuses on Polygon POS (proof-of-stake), the dominant product within the Polygon product suite, with which I have direct experience. This article also contemplates other Polygon products currently in development, based on the information I’m able to gather publicly, which will be noted when referenced.  See also: Why Solana Was Decimated by Bankman-Fried's Downfall | Opinion  There are three criteria I think are both critically important and materially different between the two chains: performance, approach to scaling and security.  1. Performance  It might be an unpopular opinion to say that transactions-per-second (TPS) is a bad metric. What really matters is seconds-per-transaction (SPT). These are not the same. Let me explain.  Transactions-per-second is calculated by taking the number of transactions in a block and dividing that by the time it takes for validators or miners to produce a block, aka block time. This method misses an important nuance in how block time feels for crypto users.  Let’s say a blockchain produces a block once every hour, but that block contains a billion transactions. This blockchain would technically boast 277,000 TPS but anyone using it wouldn’t think so. The median seconds-per-transaction (assuming normal distribution of transaction submission across the hour) would be 30 minutes. This is why block time matters.  On Solana, the block time (referred to as “slot time”) is ~0.4 seconds. On Polygon the block time is ~2 seconds. This might seem like splitting hairs but the difference between 2 seconds and a half second is a big deal. When a user experiences more than a second of latency in an app (the brain processes information it sees at <0.15 seconds), it can feel like an eternity. I’ve seen this phenomenon while working on consumer apps. Moreover, every millisecond counts when price discovery and execution are so tied for financial applications.  Another technical consideration when comparing block times is that Polygon (like other [Ethereum Virtual Machine] EVM chains) uses a mempool where transactions are indexed before being added to a block. Solana takes a different route, where transactions are submitted directly to the leader in the validator set. So while block time on Polygon is ~2 seconds, there is no guarantee a transaction will make it into the next block since it could get stuck in the mempool – especially in times of high volatility.  This phenomenon of getting “stuck” or “delayed” is a result of the block size. Imagine Venmo ran an app on-chain and needed to fill dozens of orders per second, if it chose a blockchain with 0.01-second block times that could only fit one transaction in a block, the observed SPT would be sluggish.  On Solana, blocks can theoretically reach a maximum size of 128MB. The Solana Turbine protocol breaks a block into 1280 byte packets called shreds. Through Solana’s Tower BFT protocol, these can be verified concurrently by separate validators, enabling parallelized computation.  On Polygon, the block size for the POS chain is currently between 50-120KB. There is a product in development called Polygon Avail that should increase this capacity. Avail is a data availability protocol that sits on top of the Polygon POS chain to increase storage. It is currently spec’d at 2MB per block with a 20 second block time though may scale to 128MB (with a theoretical minimum block time for a block that size of 5 seconds).  Block capacity manifests in fee markets, which we can see today. The average transaction fee on Polygon is ~$0.02 whereas Solana is ~$0.0002. According to 0x, when block utilization approaches 80%, the fee markets start increasing substantially, and as block utilization approaches 95%, it starts increasing exponentially.  Polygon is designed to scale through parallelized sidechains, which opens up the option to increase total block capacity through more chains, so that could bring the fee markets down. Although, this approach to scaling carries bigger systemic risks that, depending on what you’re building, may make building on Polygon challenging.  This is where I believe the biggest divergence in the two chains is, and is the subject of the next section.  2. Approach to scaling  A one -sentence summary of how Solana and Polygon differ on their approach to scaling would be: Solana is built to keep everything on a single chain and Polygon is built to add more concurrent chains that merge state periodically.  To expand on this, a Solana cluster (set of validators contributing to consensus) has a leader schedule. This leader schedule enumerates which validator will be verifying each block (aka a slot on Solana). With a predefined leader schedule, transactions are forwarded to the scheduled leader, cutting down on unnecessary coordination.  See also: Solana Co-Founder Sees Upside From Ethereum's Merge  In the near future Solana should also see multiple block leaders, which will improve performance and mitigate downtime. All of this is uniquely enabled by Solana’s proof-of-history consensus protocol that aligns the network around a shared clock. Without a shared timekeeper, the network has to be reactive to emergent leaders in the validation schedule.  Proof-of-history combined with the Turbine protocol enables fast streaming of large amounts of data that all lives on one chain.  Polygon has a similar system of defining a block leader through its Bor protocol, but the approach to scaling is different. Polygon is set up to scale by adding more sidechains running in parallel and merging state periodically through a commitment to Ethereum. That’s why you may see Polygon POS and Plasma referred to as a “commit chain.” Multiple, parallel sidechains may mean it’s possible for two users to be on separate sidechains using the same app, which would mean users are beholden to the latency of the state merge between chains and developers have to build for complexity.  This way Polygon scales may also introduce the risk a blockchain could see a “re-org” (where transactions are rolled back) since a user cannot reliably consider their transaction “final” until block height reaches a certain threshold. There’s no magic number for this, but as an example, stablecoin issuer Circle waits for 372 blocks to pass on Polygon (~20 minutes) before they consider a transaction “final” and 1 block (~0.4 seconds) on Solana.  Polygon’s variant finality is a substantial drawback, and may impact what type of apps could be built on it. For instance, crypto apps might put a user’s funds on hold until a transaction is considered final or allow users to transact immediately and accept the risk of a double spend exploit (like accepting credit card chargeback risk). This is a step backwards from crypto’s supposed elimination of financial counterparty risks.  A single chain will always be better than a collection of sidechains, assuming the single chain can scale. A single chain has less coordination complexity, less aggregation latency and less surface area for attack.  The question is, can Solana support the same scale that Polygon claims to do? Based on a recent demo from Kevin Bowers at Jump Crypto, it seems it can. The team at Jump Crypto has built a new validator client for Solana called Firedancer that demonstrated 1.2 million transactions per second, while maintaining the sub-second slot time. To put that into perspective, if you counted every Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram interaction as a transaction, they could all run concurrently on Solana without any performance degradation.  Polygon also has a substantial set of technical improvements in development. Specifically, the investment in zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups should result in substantial performance improvements. However, ZK rollups must settle on the layer 1 (currently Ethereum) to be considered valid – meaning while they open up capacity they also add latency.  3. Security  It’s one thing to be high-performing and scalable, but we also need confidence in the network. Both Solana and Polygon have had significant soak time, so the chance of a critical bug lying in plain sight is diminishing (although not impossible).  Given this, potential blockchain developers should focus on a network’s resiliency to bad actors trying to influence state. This is most objectively measured by the Nakamoto Coefficient (NC), a metric that quantifies the number of validators that would need to collude to corrupt a network.  At the time of this writing the Solana NC is 32 and Polygon is 4. Both are proof-of-stake networks so distribution of stake matters. Solana has approximately 1,900 validators and Polygon has roughly 100. What the Nakamoto Coefficient says here is that the top 32 validators on Solana and the top four validators on Polygon could take down the network.  Both networks would do well to increase security on this vector, and I think they both will, and both Polygon and Solana have seen an increase in their NC over the last year. As more validators come online, Polygon’s NC will grow, and other technical improvements in development like zk rollups will improve security.  It’s argued that Polygon has higher security because it commits state periodically to Ethereum. This is a bit misguided though because the Polygon network is the one updating state to Ethereum, so if four validators colluded to corrupt the ledger, in theory a commitment could be made to Ethereum with the corrupted ledger. This is a solvable problem the Polygon team and broader ecosystem are working on.  While I do think there is a divergence in security today, I think both blockchains will see big improvements here over time and we may see some convergence coming from a mix of technical and social advancements. This is probably the hardest one to project.  4. Bonus: community  While not a technical criteria, community is nonetheless an important variable in the success of a network. Polygon has an advantage in being connected to Ethereum where there is an objectively larger developer and consumer community than Solana. Further, the Polygon Foundation has done a good job cultivating brands and developers to build on its network. I would expect this to continue.  And given Polygon plans to bridge to multiple blockchains, it’ll be able to leverage existing communities bringing even more developers and consumers into the fold.  This isn’t a moat, however. It’s early in crypto, with most of the world still on the sidelines. I think performant applications will bring them in, and the developer, creator and consumer communities will congregate where the best apps and the most users are. That’s why I think the technical criteria above are a leading indicator of future community development.  While Solana had to overcome a cold-start problem, in less than three years it has grown to one of the most active developer, creator and consumer communities. There is a diverse set of developers making the core more performant and robust, while others are adding services and tooling to make the developer experience better.  See also: The Fake Team That Made Solana DeFi Look Huge  That foundation has enabled talented teams to build strong consumer experiences across the major categories in crypto. I would expect this cycle to continue, bringing more talented people into the ecosystem as the talent density compounds.  I do think both Polygon and Solana serve important needs in the broader crypto ecosystem, but I do think it is important for developers to understand the pros and cons. I hope this helps.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | SOL | TRADING,Tanner Philp,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/06/solana-vs-polygon-a-developers-perspective,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a61110bde93376b1e0a6735fdc0523a8c89ec86a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
7159098,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514777,1673017583,What To Expect As Bitcoin Pictures Bullish Divergence On Chart?,"The Bitcoin price has been making a slight recovery on its chart. Although the coin has been consolidating over the past few weeks, BTC has been attempting to make an upward movement. Over the last 24 hours, the coin has registered a 0.6% appreciation. Looking at the weekly progress, BTC has been stuck between two price levels of $16,400 and $16,900, respectively. Going by the technical outlook, the coin has depicted positive sentiments, with buyers slowly returning to the market. It also formed a bullish pattern on the daily chart, which meant that the price might encounter a recovery over the upcoming trading sessions. The accumulation showed up on the chart, which meant that the coin was experiencing demand over the past trading sessions. BTC has also formed a double bottom pattern, which is a charting pattern that resonates with an upcoming major move for the king coin. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading 76% below its all-time high, which was secured in the past year. The market capitalization of BTC also noted an increase, signifying bullish strength building up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plays Catch-Up With Altcoins, Why $28,000 Is A Key Level Bitcoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart BTC was trading at $16,800 at the time of writing. The coin crossed the $16,800 mark as demand surged. Overhead resistance for Bitcoin stood at $17,000. The double bottom formed by Bitcoin might cause the coin to rally and move above $17,000. On the other hand, if Bitcoin slips from its current price level, then the support zone for the coin stands at $16,400. A fall from $16,400 will drag the price down to $16,100. The amount of BTC traded in the last session was green, which meant that the coin was entering a bullish zone. Technical Analysis Bitcoin demand has been increasing in recent trading sessions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved up closer to the half-line and touched it, recording an increase in buyers. The RSI also formed a bullish divergence (white), which is a sign of positive price action. Similarly, Bitcoin price travelled above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which meant buyers were driving the price action in the market. A move above the 50-SMA will ensure the BTC price trades above the $17,400 mark. In relation to bullishness, other technical indicators have also sided with the incoming bullish force. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which indicates capital inflows and outflows at a given time, registered positive movement. CMF was positive and above the half-line, which portrayed an increase in capital inflows. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is responsible for reading price momentum and reversals of the same. MACD demonstrated green histograms, which were buy signals for the coin. This meant that Bitcoin could anticipate an increase in price.

In recent times, due to constant lateral trading, DOGE lost the $0.072 support line. Over the past 24 hours, the coin has dipped nearly 3% on its chart. The meme coin has only moved 0.7% in the last week. As Bitcoin started to act wobbly on its chart, many altcoins that had made gains started to retrace on their respective charts. Technical indicators, however, suggest that the asset might register gains over the next trading session. The coin has registered a fall in demand on the chart, but that is not supposed to last for long. Although DOGE had pierced through several support lines, the coin could soon make up for the loss. The crucial resistance mark for Dogecoin stood at $0.078. Buying pressure has to return to the market for Dogecoin price to target a move above $0.078 and attempt to trade near $0.080. Touching the $0.080 mark will invalidate the bearish thesis for a significant period of time. The market capitalization of Dogecoin did not indicate that bears were crawling back into the market. Related Reading: XRP Price Primed For Future Rally Following Ripple’s MENA Expansion Dogecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOGE was selling at $0.070 at press time. The coin was secured on top of its $0.066 support line, but a fall from the $0.066 level will ensure that the bears are completely back. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $0.072 and then at $0.078. As far as the indicators are concerned, the Dogecoin price shall not have too much difficulty moving above the $0.072 level, but the $0.078 price mark will prove to be a tough resistance level for Dogecoin, causing the coin to fall in value. In regard to the shorting opportunity, it is better to wait as the Dogecoin price is eyeing the next resistance level. Shorting at the moment will cause further losses for traders. The amount of Dogecoin traded in the last session fell, indicating a bearish bias. Technical Analysis A fall in accumulation on the daily chart has caused Dogecoin buyers to fade from the market. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40 mark, indicating that sellers were stronger than buyers in the market. Dogecoin’s price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which again reiterated that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Despite that, an increase in demand will push the meme coin to rise above the 200-SMA (green) line, which is considered extremely bullish. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Consolidates Gains, Why ETH Could Start Another Increase Over the past trading sessions, whenever the Dogecoin price rose above the 200-SMA line, the coin rallied. This is why shorting the asset right now would not be a wise idea. In view of the price rising over the next few trading sessions, the technical indicators have displayed buy signals. Contrary to shorting, the asset has presented an entry point for traders. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence shows the price momentum; it formed green signal bars, indicating a buy signal for the coin. Similarly, the Awesome Oscillator suggests the price trend and direction, while the indicator also displayed green histograms tied to buy signals. The buy signals translate to the price going up in the upcoming sessions.

It’s a disaster for CEO Alan Lane and his investors. But for the U.S. banking system and households who rely on it, there is much to reassure. While bad, it could have been so much worse. Silvergate hadn’t locked up customers’ deposits in loans, instead stacking its $15 billion balance sheet with government bonds and other easy-to-sell assets. By Breakingviews Alan Lane’s dreams may have collapsed, but his bank has not. Silvergate Capital ( SI ), a deposit-taker for cryptocurrency firms, said on Thursday that it had been forced to raise funds in a hurry and flog assets after digital asset customers pulled almost 70% of their balances. It’s a disaster for Lane and his investors. For the U.S. banking system and households who rely on it, there is much to reassure. What happened to Silvergate was a classic - and these days rare - bank run. Deposits from crypto firms fell to $3.8 billion in December from $11.9 billion in September. The panic was partly prompted by the failure of bankrupt exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ), one of Lane’s customers. The fact that the government only insures deposits up to $250,000, and institutions are likely to have much more than that in their accounts, doesn’t help. To meet the demand for cash, Silvergate had to sell securities it holds and tap wholesale funding markets. While bad, it could have been so much worse. Silvergate hadn’t locked up customers’ deposits in loans, instead stacking its $15 billion balance sheet with government bonds and other easy-to-sell assets. It has around $1.1 billion of approved lending commitments to customers, secured exclusively against bitcoin, but those have registered no losses. Instead of using deposits as lending fuel, Silvergate instead treated them as lubricant for the Silvergate Exchange Network, its payment product - actively discouraging customers from parking more funds than they needed. Silvergate is an outlier in other ways too. Its equity capital in September was equivalent to roughly 40% of its risk-weighted assets, around four times higher than most big banks. That may be partly down to Lane’s conservatism. But bank regulators too have kept crypto on a tight leash: they warned on Tuesday that they are closely watching banks with crypto-focused business models. Banks can’t hold crypto directly. Silvergate has multiple agencies, from the Federal Reserve to the California financial regulator, breathing down its neck. Lane’s bank is nonetheless now a wisp of its former self. It has cut around 40% of its workforce and back-burnered plans to launch a blockchain-based payment product. The shares are down 90% in less than six months. It’s embarrassing for sure. But for now, that’s all it is. If a go-to crypto bank can lose most of its deposits without failing or spreading chaos to other institutions, it suggests the firewall between digital and traditional finance is holding up. Context News Silvergate Capital said on January 5 that deposits from cryptocurrency customers had fallen to $3.8 billion as of December 31, a 68% slump that led the bank to sell investment securities, raise new funding and cut its workforce by 40%. Silvergate, which counted bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX among its customers, provides banking services to digital asset companies, including a payment network for institutions called the Silvergate Exchange Network, which had daily volumes of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Chief Executive Alan Lane said that the bank now has $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, exceeding its balance of customer deposits, having raised money from the market and from government-sponsored Federal Home Loan Banks. He attributed the withdrawal in deposits to a “crisis of confidence” in the crypto space. The sale of securities saddles Silvergate with a $718 million loss. It will also take a $196 million impairment charge to reflect the reduced value of technology it had acquired with a view to launching a blockchain-based payment product. Before the announcement, analysts had expected Silvergate to make $124 million of earnings in 2023, according to Refinitiv.

7158879,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515071,1673017210,Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Large Dormant Supply On The Move,"On-chain data shows a large amount of old Bitcoin supply has moved in the last few days, something that could be bearish for the crypto’s price. Bitcoin Supply Older Than 2 Years Showed Movement In The Past Week As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a total of four large transfers with old supply have taken place in the last week. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Age Bands” (SOAB), which tells us the total number of coins that each age band is moving on the chain right now. The age bands refer to supply groups divided based on the criteria of the age of the coins (or more precisely, of the UTXOs). For example, the 1m-3m age band includes all coins that have been sitting dormant inside the same addresses since at least 1 month ago and at most 3 months ago. The SOAB metric for this group would then measure the total number of these coins that have been transferred to another wallet. Now, the age bands of interest here are the 2y-3y and 3y-5y groups. Typically, investors that have been holding their coins since more than 155 days ago are said to be the “long-term holders” (LTHs), so both these bands include coins belonging to two different segments of the LTHs. Also, it’s a statistical fact that the longer investors hold onto their BTC, the less probable they become to sell at any point. This implies that the holders with such aged supply as in these bands would be some of the most resolute HODLers in the market. Here is a chart that shows the SOAB data for these two Bitcoin age bands over the past week: Looks like there have been multiple spikes in this metric in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph displays, there have been four large movements of coins belonging to these cohorts in the last few days. Three of these transfers were from the 2y-3y age band, while one was from the 3y-5y group. Related Reading: Ethereum Surges 4% As Whales Show Elevated Activity The spike from the latter cohort was significantly larger than the others, amounting to more than 15,000 BTC being moved. All the transfers from the 2y-3y age band combined came to almost 13,000 BTC, which is still less than the 3y-5y group’s transactions. Generally, large movements of such old Bitcoin supply is a sign of dumping from the LTHs, and if it’s the case here as well, then it would mean that the current market broke these so-called diamond hands into selling. The quant notes that these transfers were at least not headed towards exchanges, which does reduce the probability of these transactions being for selling purposes (but obviously doesn’t eliminate the chances, as these investors could just have been selling through OTC deals).

7156672,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515089,1673013639,XRP Price Primed For Future Rally Following Ripple’s MENA Expansion,"The XRP price has rather underperformed within the last two years. While XRP has fallen 90.04% from the all-time high of $3.40 on January 6, 2018, Bitcoin (-75.76%) and Ethereum (-74.52%) show considerably smaller losses. One of the main reasons for this is probably the lawsuit filed against Ripple by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has caused a lot of uncertainty among investors. In addition, numerous exchanges have delisted XRP or, like Grayscale, dissolved their XRP trust. A settlement with the SEC or a Ripple court victory is therefore considered an extremely strong catalyst for the XRP price. Ripple Is Expanding Adoption Of ODL However, another reason to be bullish is the XRP-based On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) technology by Ripple, which continues to be adopted heavily beyond the U.S. In an interview, Navin Gupta, Ripple’s managing director for South Asia and MENA, said that ODL is available in markets representing nearly 90% of the $6 trillion daily foreign exchange market. Related Reading: Mt. Gox Payout Deadline Postponed Again, Next Bitcoin Price Dump In 2023? Gupta further remarked that there is a lot of interest in XRP-based technology in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region: We have seen a great deal of interest from institutions across MENA to use On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) to underpin the remittance services they offer, and we already have local payments service providers such as Pyypl using the solution to facilitate remittances between the UAE and other countries around the world. The executives also revealed that Ripple is expecting further growth in the region, adding; “[w]e have partnerships with several leading banks in the region, including with SABB in Saudi Arabia and QNB in Qatar. We are also working with local payment services providers such as Pyypl and LuLu Money, which are using Ripple’s crypto solution to facilitate global movements between different currencies.” As Gupta also pointed out, the total payment volume of RippleNet has grown over $15 billion in the last year, while the global ODL volume has increased ninefold year-on-year. In the United Arab Emirates, in particular, Ripple is finding an open stance towards the use of cryptocurrencies for remittances and treasury payments. Related Reading: Santiment Paints Bullish Picture For XRP, But This May Not Be The Case More recently, Gupta has observed that traditional financial institutions are becoming more comfortable with the idea of adopting crypto. “While traditional financial institutions have been slower to adopt, MENA is certainly seeing an increase in new services and adoption in the region by both consumers and enterprises,” he added. The XRP Price Today At press time, the XRP price was trading at $0.3339. This puts the price just above the key support level at $0.3333 where it needs a bounce to avoid falling toward the next support level at $0.3212. To the upside, XRP bulls need to push the price above $0.3548 to build momentum.

The unemployment rate fell 3.5%, versus expectations that it would remain at 3.7%.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) was steady at $16,750 in the minutes following the release of the report.  Even though the headline jobs number topped expectations, the trend of slowing growth is clear. Monthly job gains in the first half of 2022 were routinely above 300,000, and December's number is the lowest since April 2021.  In addition, the closely watched wages details were softer than forecast. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in December, down from 0.4% growth in November and below expectations for an 0.4% increase. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings rose 4.6% in December, below expectations for 5% growth.  Combined with reports earlier this week showing continued weakness in the manufacturing sector, the jobs figures may be enough for the Federal Reserve to note that its rate hikes in 2022 are slowing down the economy.  In its December meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its interest-rate hike to 0.5 percentage point from the 0.75 percentage point it had increased its benchmark rate at its previous four meetings.

7155072,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515058,1673011230,"Mt. Gox Payout Deadline Postponed Again, Next Bitcoin Price Dump In 2023?","One concern for Bitcoin investors has taken a back seat in recent weeks and months amid macroeconomic headwinds and crypto-intrinsic contagion effects: the release of recovered BTC from Mt Gox. Originally, users of what was once the largest Bitcoin exchange were supposed to file their claims by January 10, 2023. Shortly after that, payouts were to begin, according to an October statement. However, the deadline has already been pushed back countless times. And as a document released today by rehabilitation trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi shows, Mt. Gox claimants will have to continue to be patient. The deadline for repayment method selection and registration is postponed from January 10, 2023, to March 10, 2023 (Japan time) to “take into account various circumstances, such as the progress of rehabilitation creditors in terms of selection and registration.” The document goes on to say that after that date, Kobayashi will begin confirming registrations “in order to make the repayment as soon as possible after March 10, 2023.” Following this change, Kobayashi has also changed the base repayment deadline, early lump-sum repayment deadline, and intermediate repayment deadline from July 31, 2023, to September 30, 2023. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains 4.5% in Weekly Timescale As Shanghai Upgrade Nears Is The Bitcoin Price Facing A Price Dump? According to the rehabilitation plan, victims of the Mt. Gox hack will be reimbursed a total of 141,686 Bitcoin (BTC), the equivalent of about $2.37 billion. Because of that, concerns about a massive price drop have been circulating in the crypto space for some time. The question is whether the Mt. Gox Bitcoin situation will push the price into heavy losses once again. However, looking at the facts, this does not seem very likely. There is a lot of false information circulating on Twitter. But the fact is that Bitcoin will not be dumped on the market all at once. Not all of Mt. Gox’s customers are likely to sell their Bitcoins, although customers may enjoy enormously high returns by already holding them involuntarily. Moreover, Kobayashi will not release all Bitcoins at once, rather the whole process will take several months – from March to the end of September according to the current schedule. Related Reading: Research Firm Issues Warning For Bitcoin And ETH Investors Over DCG Situation And even if a large portion of BTC is dumped, it is very likely that the market can easily handle the additional liquidity. The impact is likely to be small, as the daily trading volume would still be enough to cushion the selling, even at the historic low of around $15 billion. Bitcoin Price Today At press time, BTC was trading at $16,739 and struggling with support at $16,740. Ideally, the Bitcoin price needs to hold above $16,600 to avoid a slide below $16,000 and maintain upside momentum. If this is successful, a move to the upside towards $17,000 could be possible, where the next key resistance is waiting.

The 56 million shares, in principle owned by Bankman-Fried and FTX co-founder Gary Wang through a holding company called Emergent Fidelity Technologies, are the subject of a complex legal battle that also includes bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi and the U.S. Department of Justice. In a filing with a U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware, FTX said the shares were only nominally held by Emergent Fidelity and should be frozen until they can be divided up fairly among FTX creditors. Bankman-Fried opposed that idea in a court filing made Thursday, arguing that he and Wang had legitimately bought the shares using money borrowed from FTX’s trading arm, Alameda Research, and that the loan was documented.  Digital Currency Group, the cryptocurrency conglomerate whose Genesis Global Trading division announced more layoffs on Thursday, said it's shutting down its wealth-management division called HQ. ""Due the state of the broader economic environment and prolonged crypto winter presenting significant headwinds to the industry, we made the decision to wind down HQ"" as of Jan. 31, the company said in a statement. DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  The price of tron, the 18th-largest token by market capitalization, tumbled Fridayamid tensions stemming from crypto exchange Huobi as the broader crypto market held steady. Justin Sun, who is the founder of Tron, sits on Huobi’s advisory board. The exchange said Friday it will cut its headcount by 20% and also closed internal staff communication channels to quell a rebellion, according to reports on Twitter. TRX fell nearly 8% in the past 24 hours, data shows. Huobi’s native HT exchange tokens have lost as much as 11% in the past 24 hours. Tron’s troubles come amid the crypto winter and ahead of the U.S. jobs report for December, which is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.  Chart of the Day  The chart compares the trading volume in the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) market with the year-over-year rate of change in U.S. personal income.  Personal income boosted NFT trading volumes between October 2020 and October 2021.  ""NFTs, representing a high-risk sub-sector within a high-risk market, should be susceptible to the rate of change of personal income. Higher inflation and muted real wage growth have been the perfect cocktail for lower disposable income,"" Lewis Harland, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, said in a 2022 review note.  ""This model implies that a low or negative personal income rate of change may hinder significant NFT adoption. We are unlikely to see new NFT monthly volumes ATHs (all-time highs) in 2023 if a global recession plays out,"" Harland added.  – Omkar Godbole     Trending Posts  Bitcoin, Ether Options Market See Mixed Flow Ahead of US Nonfarm Payrolls  Case for Bitcoin Weakens as Global Stockpile of Sub-Zero Bond Yields Vanishes  Crypto Exchange Huobi Experiences Heavy Token Outflows: Nansen",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/06/first-mover-americas-sams-seeking-to-keep-control-of-robinhood-shares,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c0ec3f1e4794e62e0547aba5b80bd6e1f10e62d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413212,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl87Qo,1673010946,"Crypto Bank Silvergate Downgraded by Wall Street Banks, Moody's After Q4 Results, Shares Slump","Silvergate Capital (SI) witnessed worse-than-expected deposit outflows in the fourth quarter and the financial impacts of these outflows will have implications on long-term profitability, J.P. Morgan said in a research report on Friday.  J.P. Morgan downgraded its rating on the stock from overweight to neutral and slashed its price target to $14 from $30. Bank of America downgraded its rating on the crypto bank's shares to underperform, while Canaccord Genuity, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley all cut their price targets.  Separately, ratings agency Moody's downgraded Silvergate's long-term deposit rating to Ba1, or junk status, based on the announcement of significantly decreased crypto deposits, large losses to meet its liquidity needs, impairment of technology assets and layoffs.  “These events highlight Silvergate Bank's significant operating challenges, in particular the profitability, funding and liquidity risk associated with amplified deposit volatility driven by uncertainty in the crypto currency market and the bank's narrow business model,” Sadia Nabi, a senior analyst at Moody’s Financial Institutions Group, said.  Shares of Silvergate Capital fell over 10%in premarket trading to $11.21. They plunged 43% on Thursday after the bank released some of its fourth-quarter financial results.  “While the challenging backdrop for the crypto settlement business was a factor in the worse-than-expected results being released, we also believe that concerns voiced by short sellers (on Twitter) likely also contributed to Silvergate’s customers withdrawing deposits from the platform at a greater-than-anticipated level,” J.P. Morgan analysts led by Steven Alexopoulos wrote.  J.P. Morgan says it expects deposit balances to ""normalize"" to late-2020 levels, but cautions that they could normalize at much lower levels as crypto customers have moved to a “risk-off” position and are sitting on the sidelines.  Still, the bank said it remains “bullish” on blockchain technology.

On Thursday, the company said it's slashing headcount by around 40% in a cost-cutting move. Also, it's taking a $196M impairment charge after seeing a nearly 70% Q/Q drawdown in digital asset customer deposits amid a tough backdrop for the crypto space. ""The implications to the company’s business from the significant reduction in client deposits has near- as well as longer-term impacts,"" Alexopoulos wrote in a note. Over the medium term, deposit balances will likely keep retreating back toward levels seen prior to 2020 levels, before the latest bull market took hold, he noted. For the long-term, the company's profitability will be impacted since it will likely need to maintain higher levels of liquidity than before. ""While one could argue that the shares remain cheap on the surface, given the wildcards associated with the medium- as well as long-term impacts to the business, we see upside potential being fairly limited until the earnings power of the franchise is better understood,"" the analyst contended. Similarly, Bank of America analyst Brandon Berman cut Silvergate ( SI ) stock to Underperform from Neutral after its Q4 metrics ""introduced a new overhang on the stock: negative earnings growth,"" he wrote in a note. Berman lowered his 2023 EPS estimate by 90% to $0.67, mostly reflecting a 50% reduction to his revenue growth forecast. By comparison, analysts expect EPS to grow 64.8% Y/Y to $2.46. In late October, when SI was around $60 a share, Seeking Alpha's Quant rating system flagged the stock at high risk of performing badly given negative EPS revisions and decelerating momentum. Now, SI is changing hands at $11.24. In mid-December, BTIG said short traders will eventually cover their bearish bets on SI, resulting in a short squeeze .",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3922621-silvergate-capital-stock-extends-drop-after-losing-bull-rating-at-jpmorgan?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7154812.jpeg

In December, the SEC charged former FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried with scheming to defraud equity investors who stumped up over $1.8 billion for the company – but is also probing whether those companies did their homework to ensure the investment was sound, the report said.  The report did not name which companies were under investigation, and the probe does not indicate wrongdoing but will focus on whether the companies fulfilled their fiduciary duty to their own investors, Reuters said.  The collapse of FTX, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, has led to a slew of legal cases. Bankman-Fried has also been charged by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Department of Justice, and pleaded not guilty to money laundering and wire fraud in a New York court on Tuesday.  The battle to wind the company up has also led to a multiple legal claims over who actually owns various assets, including luxury Bahamas properties and $450 million in Robinhood shares.

7151019,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515066,1673004879,Ethereum Gains 4.5% in Weekly Timescale As Shanghai Upgrade Nears,"Ethereum, the king altcoin, has been generating a lot of buzz lately. According to CoinGecko, the coin appreciated by 4.5% in the weekly timescale. This is because of the upcoming “Shanghai” upgrade which is expected to improve the overall usability of Ether’s Layer 1 chain. The term “Layer 1” describes the fundamental components of a network. Transactions on L1 blockchains do not require the involvement of any additional networks for verification or settlement. Related Reading: Binance Acquisition Moves See BNB Riding A Wave of Enthusiasm Image: Gfinity Esports The Gist Of The Upgrade After the widely-recognized switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus last year, Ethereum’s next big update is called Shanghai. The team has already mentioned that the forthcoming Shanghai upgrade, scheduled for release this September or later, will allow for the withdrawal of staked ETH in addition to other minor enhancements. The most noteworthy development to come out of Shanghai is the proposal known as EIP-4895, which will make it possible for those who took part in staking ETH into the Ethereum 2.0 contract to withdraw cash and staking incentives. Another major highlight is the planned reduction of the Layer-2 gas fees as improvements would be made on the rollup system of L2s. This would allow more data to be processed on a single transaction therefore making the fees lower. Short-Term: Anything Can Happen Although this news is great and all, the hype generated by this event could be sensationalized. The Merge, which was greatly publicized until the change happened, saw ETH drop after completing the consensus change. This increase could be another sell-the-news event which sees strong anticipation that the asset would go up in price. But with the upgrade happening in such a long time, further drops are possible as macroeconomics plays a huge part in ETH’s price movements. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $1,244, up 4.5% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Related Reading: ApeCoin: Will January See The End of APE’s Recovery? ETH total market cap at $152 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com If the next week’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data see that macro trend improving, we could see the U.S. Federal Reserve loosen up as they are aggressively trying to pin inflation at 2%. A dovish central bank will see more investors trusting that the market will be safe, thus moving capital to more volatile assets like crypto. Meanwhile, Ethereum investors and traders should focus on the consolidation on top of the $1,244 level. Bulls can and should target $1,270 resistance short-term to produce profits. But with only a few days before the CPI data is released, investors and traders should capitalize on this small gain made by Ethereum this week. -Featured Image: Medium",POSITIVE,ETH,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-investors-gain-4-5/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/7151019.jpeg

The latest on the list of fear-causing information is Justin Sun’s USDD stablecoin and popular crypto exchange Huobi. Mike Alfred, an investor serving as a board member of BTC miner Iris Energy and digital asset investment platform Eaglebrook Advisors, earlier today voiced out some warnings on USDD stablecoin and Huobi Exchange. According to Alfred, Justin Sun shadow owns Huobi, and he is perhaps the “most erratic billionaire in crypto.” Justin has been sending a handful of billions of dollars of stablecoins around the space, including in and out of exchanges such as Binance, said Alfred. Adding, “Something huge is afoot. Withdraw all coins from unregulated exchanges.” Related Reading: What Happens If Crypto Exchange Binance Bust Like FTX and Terra? He also went ahead to tackle Justin Sun’s USDD stablecoin saying the algorithmic stablecoin on Tron has de-pegged and could be in the process of collapsing. “It’s code red time in crypto again,” Alfred concluded. Following the accusations that Justin Sun appears to shadow-own Huobi, rumors of the exchange being insolvent have now begun to spread. When a tweep commented on Alfred’s post saying, “I doubt he is a billionaire.” Alfred replied that Justin cashed out $1.5 billion to fiat in the last couple of months. “He’s looting Huobi before it crashes.” Is Huobi Really Insolvent? Several theories have intensified Huobi’s rumor of being insolvent. It was reported yesterday that Huobi had shut down internal employee communication groups and feedback channels and is now asking employees to receive their salaries in stablecoins. While the validation of the rumor has not been confirmed, and there have been no reports of clogging of withdrawals on Huobi yet, the conclusion of whether the exchange is solvent or not is still quite an uncertain projection. Amid the ongoing Huobi rumors, the exchange has entered the red in trading volume over the last 24 hours. According to data from Coinmarketcap, Huobi’s 24-hour trading volume is down by over 15%, sitting at $343 billion. Related Reading: Huobi Token Breaches $7 Marker Following Update On This Planned Coin Unveiling Effect On USDD And The Crypto Market As of the time of writing, USDD has de-pegged and is now trading at $0.9799 with a trading volume of $33.5 million. The Huobi native token (HT) has also fallen by more than 7% in the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $20.5 million over the same time period. There hasn’t been any significant drop in the global crypto market; however, should the rumor about Huobi be true and the exchange eventually crashes, there could be potential drops, particularly in altcoins. Furthermore, both Bitcoin and Ethereum seem to be in a consolidation state, almost as if they are waiting for significant news before they begin to move.

The exchange, which saw turbulent trading in its HT token during Asian daytime hours after it confirmed a 20% headcount reduction, has experienced outflows of $64 million in the past 24 hours. That brings its weekly outflow count to over $100 million, according to Nansen data, and compares with $22 million in outflows at rival exchange Kraken.  Nansen notes that the highest outflows came from stablecoins USDT and USDC and from ether (ETH) wallets that had high balances.  Meanwhile, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain who sits on Huobi's advisory board, sent $100 million to the exchange. On-chain research house Look On Chain said wallets historically tagged to Sun withdrew $100 million in USDC and USDT from Binance, and Etherscan data shows the funds being transferred into Huobi.  Huobi’s key to success is to ""Ignore FUD and Keep Building,"" Sun tweeted, using the acronym for fear, uncertainty and doubt.  Before the influx, Huobi's stablecoin balance sat at $681 million, down 9.5% in a week, the data from Nansen shows. A sharp increase in outflows of stablecoins from FTX occurred before that exchange collapsed in November.  “Huobi seems to be very vulnerable at the moment,” said Ki Young Ju, CEO of analytics firm CryptoQuant.  Ju noted that Huobi’s bitcoin (BTC) reserves are down 90% in the past year while Binance’s have more than doubled during that period. Huobi’s active user addresses have dropped significantly, too, according to CryptoQuant.  ""Huobi’s user activeness dropped 44x lower from the peak in May 2019, and 20x lower than Binance as of 3rd Jan., 2023,"" CryptoQuant said in a report shared with CoinDesk.  Of particular concern during this stress test is the health of Huobi's HT token.  Last month, CryptoQuant said, of all the exchanges, Huobi has the ""dirtiest"" reserves, because it relies on its exchange token. OKX and Deribit have the cleanest, it said.  Nansen notes that Huobi holds 81% of the circulating supply, or 131.6 million out of 162.2 million, of the HT token.  According to CoinGecko data the token had a 24-hour trading volume of only $21 million, compared with its market cap of $770 million.  Its +2% bid depth also remains comparatively narrow, according to CoinGecko data, when compared with other tokens that have similar market caps. In a quarterly market report, Clara Medalie, director of research at data provider Kaiko, said that the lack of 2% bid depth was a major red flag for FTX’s FTT token.

Tron founder Justin Sun sits on Huobi’s advisory board. The exchange said Friday it will cut its headcount by 20% and require employees to take their salaries in stablecoins. It also closed internal staff communication channels to quell a rebellion, according to reports on Twitter.  TRX fell nearly 8% in the past 24 hours, data shows. The price is above a support level of 5 cents, and if it drops below that, the tokens could slip to as low as 3 cents, price charts show. Huobi’s native HT exchange tokens have lost as much as 11% in the past 24 hours.  The Tron-based stablecoin USDD fell 3 cents, effectively losing its intended peg to the U.S. dollar. Such price action caused the value locked on Tron-based decentralized applications to fall by 2%, DefiLlama data shows.  Futures tracking TRX saw less than $1 million in liquidations on exchanges, suggesting the selling was mostly spot driven. Spot refers to actual tokens, while futures are derivative financial instruments that allow traders to bet on the prices of the underlying tokens.  Meanwhile, security firm PeckShield noted on Twitter that crypto wallet addresses linked to Sun moved over $50 million to crypto exchange Binance.  The fund movements came amid speculation among Twitter users about the overall health of Huobi and the safety of customer funds.

The value of the Global Negative-Yielding Debt Index from Bloomberg and Barclays has dropped to zero from a record $18.4 trillion in December 2020.  A negative-yielding bond offers less money at maturity than the original buying price.  The amount of negative-yielding debt rose sharply following the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020 as central banks injected record liquidity via rate cuts and bond purchases to cushion markets and the economy from the adverse impact of COVID-19.  The resulting hunger for yields saw investors rotate money out of fixed-income securities and into bitcoin (BTC) and tech stocks.  Bitcoin chalked up a sixfold rally to record highs above $60,000 in the six months to April 2021.  Bond yields remain negative when adjusted for inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.

42388243,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRBhWV,1672996987,Sam Bankman-Fried Seeks to Keep Grasp on $450M in Robinhood Shares,"Sam Bankman-Fried is arguing that he should retain control of around $450 million in shares of financial trading app Robinhood Markets (HOOD), disputing a rival claim by the estate of the company he founded and once ran, the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.  The 56 million shares, in principle owned by Bankman-Fried and co-founder Gary Wang through a holding company called Emergent Fidelity Technologies, are the subject of a complex legal battle that also includes bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi and the U.S. Justice Department.  In a Dec. 22 filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, FTX – now under the management of restructuring expert John Ray III – said the shares were only nominally held by Emergent Fidelity and should be frozen until they can be divided up fairly among FTX creditors. Its claim was supported by those liquidating the company in the Bahamas.  Bankman-Fried opposed that idea in a court filing Thursday, arguing that he and Wang had legitimately bought the shares using money borrowed from FTX’s trading arm, Alameda Research, and that the loan was documented. BlockFi, a lender that FTX last year attempted to prop up before it also filed for bankruptcy, also opposed Bankman-Fried's attempt to seize control of the shares in a separate court filing on Thursday.  “It is improper for the FTX debtors to ask the court to simply assume that everything Mr. Bankman-Fried ever touched is presumptively fraudulent,” Bankman-Fried's filing said. “Mr. Bankman-Fried requires some of these funds to pay for his criminal defense.”  Bankman-Fried, who this week pleaded not guilty to federal criminal charges including money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, resigned as FTX's CEO on Nov. 11, the same day FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware following a CoinDesk report that showed the unusually tight ties between FTX and Alameda.  FTX's new management argued in December that Emergent Fidelity, owned 90% by Bankman-Fried and 10% by Wang, was a shell company, whose interests were “sufficiently identical” to those of the wider company. Ray has previously complained of defective record-keeping at FTX, and in particular of transfers being made to staff without proper documentation.  In any case, the filings concede, the debate may prove academic, after a representative of the U.S. Department of Justice told the court Wednesday that the government was seizing the shares as part of its proceedings against Bankman-Fried.

42388244,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRBhbB,1672995918,How AI Could Solve the Metaverse’s Language Problem,"LAS VEGAS — A key of the metaverse is its inherent democratization: Everybody on the planet theoretically has access to the same virtual world(s), with none of the usual barriers to entry that geography imposes.  Except for one. If the people meeting in the metaverse don’t speak the same language, sharing an experience can get difficult. Sure, there are services like Google Translate and Skype Translator that do a good job of offering written or spoken translation, but the issue quickly becomes one of scale: Those services are generally designed for one-to-one conversations, whereas a metaverse experience often wants to incorporate dozens, if not hundreds, of people. If each person is speaking his own language, that’s a hard problem to solve.  Enter OneMeta AI. The company's Verbum service, which is making its debut at CES 2023, can provide real-time translation of up to 50 individuals, all speaking a different language (it supports 82 languages and 40 dialects, the company says). And it doesn’t deliver just real-time transcripts – the AI can provide voice, too.  “You could have 50 people on a Zoom call, and they could each have their own native tongue,” OneMeta spokesman David Politis said. “They would hear someone speak in Japanese, but they would then hear it in English or in Italian or in Russian and on-screen they would see it in their language as well.”  We got a chance to demo Verbum at CES on Thursday night. As we spoke through a headset to a woman in Central America, the system translated our words to Spanish and her responses to English. Although there was a slight delay, the conversation felt natural and flowed well. Words were transcribed within a second being spoken, and the AI voice – which sounded as good if not better than the TikTok lady – came on about a second after that.  OneMeta is initially aiming Verbum at group meetings for international teams, but the service is clearly applicable to metaverse experiences, as well: Imagine a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) where the users are all over the world and want to talk to each other quickly in real-time situations (think Call of Duty), or an esports tournament where the audience wants to both understand the action and socialize with each other at the same time.  “The most commonly spoken language is English,” Politis said. “But if your native language is Portuguese or Russian, your English is rarely going to be the same as your native language. And so there is going to be miscommunication – it’s just going to happen. We can eliminate almost all of that.”  There’s definitely a need for what OneMeta is offering with Verbum, but its success will depend on whether others – in particular Microsoft (MSFT) and Google, which have resources OneMeta doesn’t – rise to meet the same challenge.",POSITIVE,없음,OTHER,Pete Pachal,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/06/how-ai-could-solve-the-metaverses-language-problem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab71462432d13187d61a8e1e3694e29733513344-1792x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move claimed to have effectively burned all tokens earmarked for developers of the project.  Solana community members considered the burn a step towards the legitimacy of the Bonk Inu project – one that calls itself a token “for the people, by the people” by actively avoiding insider token sales and predatory behavior.  In the past 24 hours, centralized exchanges and decentralized applications alike introduced bonk-based trading events and non-fungible token mints, adding to the utility of the meme coin for traders and holders.  Data shows over three million BONK transactions were conducted over the past three days, suggesting active participation from holders. Unique BONK holding wallets have grown to over 86,000 as of Friday from under 25,000 at the start of this week.  However, large token sales have impeded bonk’s price rise, which is now over 2,000% in the past week. The tokens are down over 40% in the past 24 hours as early investors took profit and crypto exchanges, such as Bybit, introduced bonk futures, allowing traders to bet against the token.  The quick rise of Bonk Inu, fashioned around the popular shiba inu dog breed which has spurred popular projects such as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, can be attributed to several factors.  Last week, Bonk developers airdropped 50% of its entire token supply to several Solana-based NFT collections and creators, resulting in near-instant hype and a market for the project.  Holders of a total of 297,000 individual Solana-based NFTs were said to receive the airdrop. Airdrops refer to an unsolicited distribution of a cryptocurrency token or coin, usually for free, to numerous wallet addresses and are generally used as a tactic to gain users.  The project actively called out the “toxic tokenomics” of embattled funds such as Alameda Research – which was widely criticized for distributing a small part of the token supply to retail traders while keeping a majority for private investors and project developers.  Several Solana projects have already integrated bonk tokens for use as payments for listed NFTs, while some introduced “burn” mechanisms for NFT-based events. Token burning means removing coins from the overall supply of a cryptocurrency.  As such, liquidity pools on Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as Orca have attracted over $20 million in volume for trading pairs involving BONK – cumulatively netting thousands of dollars in fees for liquidity providers.  Liquidity providers are investors who stake their cryptocurrency tokens on DEXs to earn transaction fees, usually in the form of token rewards.  Data from Orca shows the BONK/SOL pair has conducted over $14 million in trading volume, while the BONK/USD coin pair saw over $6.2 million. Both pools are paying out nearly 1% hourly to liquidity providers, or over 24% each day.",POSITIVE,SOL | BONK,BUSINESS | SHIB | SOL | BONK | TOKEN SALE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/06/bonk-inu-developers-burn-all-their-team-tokens-as-solana-ecosystem-frenzy-continues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78d162217f69aa8b4bd254f4b2049f1cee0dd521-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to recent news, Binance acquired a 41% stake on Korean crypto exchange Gopax. The deal was originally scheduled to be revealed last year, and it involved Binance buying the stock holding from Lee Jun-hang, Gopax’s top stakeholder. BNB, Binance’s native token, took the news to heart with a weekly gain of 5.5%. As of this writing, BNB is trading at $255, data from Coingecko shows.

In the period of 2020 to 2021, Binance KR trading pairs and a hard shutdown of the service in the country was completed. This was due to tight crypto regulation in the country. Gopax was hit hard after FTX collapsed. During this time, the exchange experienced a liquidity problem forcing the Korean exchange to suspend payments. With the onset of Binance capital flowing into the exchange, we can expect Gopax to rebound from last year’s disaster.

With almost no barrier now, this development should push through in the coming weeks as the acquisition is being finalized. With this in mind, Binance’s presence in South Korea would further cement the company as a major player in the centralized exchange market. However, one can’t be too sure of the future. Nearly a month ago, a Reddit post regarding Binance’s supposed audit exposed a concerning development.

42388253,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRBiLx,1672991814,"Bitcoin, Ether Options Market See Mixed Flow Ahead of US Jobs Report","The bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) options market saw mixed flows ahead of the crucial U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, with a focus on setting strategies that profit from a potential post-data volatility explosion.  ""We have seen two-way flows ahead of the data release, with some clients putting on short-dated put spreads on BTC and ETH for downside protection. At the same time, there has also been buying interest in short-dated call spreads,"" Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven trading firm TDX Strategies, said.  A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market. A call option gives the right to purchase and the call buyer is bullish on the market.  A bear put spread is created when an equal number of puts are bought and sold simultaneously at different strikes. It's a low-cost, limited-profit bearish strategy, unlike the outright long put strategy where the profit potential is unlimited. Call spreads work the other way around.  The need to add downside protection likely stemmed from fears that an upbeat jobs figure would encourage the already hawkish Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for a prolonged time.  The data due at 13:30 UTC is likely to show the world's largest economy added 200,000 jobs in December after November's 263,000 additions, according to Reuters. The unemployment rate is forecast to remain unchanged at 3.7%, while the average hourly earnings growth is expected to have slowed to 5% year-over-year from 5.1%.  The Fed has raised rates by 4.25 percentage points since March, hoping that the aggressive tightening would weigh over the labor market and help control inflation. The jobs market, however, has remained remarkably resilient, with monthly increases averaging well above 200,000 since September.  Therefore, the headline figure needs to be well below estimates to avoid an adverse reaction in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""We would need to see a number sub-200k to suggest a sufficient easing of labor market conditions, which could then fuel a risk-on rally. A number in line with expectations likely results in muted to mildly negative price action,"" Lo told CoinDesk.  A risk-on rally would bode well for traders who have taken call spreads, perhaps expecting that the data would weaken the case for continued Fed tightening.  Some traders have been snapping up bullish volatility trades like long strangles on Deribit, the world's largest crypto options trading exchange by open interest and volume.  Strangle involves buying bullish calls and bearish puts with the same expiry at strikes equidistant from the underlying asset's current market price. The strategy makes money as long as the underlying asset charts a big move in either direction.  Hence, traders typically buy strangles ahead of volatility-boosting binary events like the release of the jobs report, Federal Reserve meetings and election results.  ""Investors appear to be betting on a significant price move post-NFP,"" Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said, referring to nonfarm payrolls.  Options trading is a risky business. While strangles look simple, they aren't without risks.

According to CoinGecko, the token gained over 13% in the past month, ending the year on the spot with other gainers. But the token has depreciated by almost 5% in the past 24 hours, and trading at $3.96. This might set a precedent to what can happen in the next few weeks. Related Reading: Cronos (CRO) Up 4% In Last Week Amid Recession Fears NFTs, Macros And What It Means For ApeCoin Recent events in the NFT space might have an effect on the already dwindling interest in nonfungible tokens. First, Nikhail Gopalani, COO of RTFKT, got his NFT collection phished from him. According to publicly available information, the total stolen was $173,000. The next hack happened on January 4, when CryptoNovo lost over $618,000 worth of NFTs. This along with dwindling interest in NFTs will certainly have an effect on APE’s price. But with the token being part of the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem, the effect might be dampened. Lately, however, the token has been highly correlated with Ethereum which would determine where ApeCoin will go. Although ETH has appreciated in the past few days leading up to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Meeting Minutes, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s continued hawkish stance would make the broader financial system slip and tumble as fears of an oncoming recession grows. Any negative market movement would lead to pain in the crypto market, dragging ApeCoin down. This would also lead to capital flight, meaning that cash would exit the cryptocurrency market and enter safe-haven assets like gold or government bonds. Crypto total market cap at $775 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com Bears And Bulls In Constant Tussle As the days go by, APE investors and traders should be able to breach the $4.19 resistance as a break through this level would give the bulls momentum for higher highs. However, with major headwinds and fear, uncertainty and doubt blocking the path of APE, this resistance might prove difficult to break. Related Reading: BONK Goes Bonkers With Over 200% Increase In Last 24 Hours – Will This Save Solana? Image: Binance Academy Short-term, APE holders might see gains as the bulls remain on the market. But with that said, investors and traders should watch the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data next week. This indicator would provide a clear picture on whether the U.S. central bank would increase interest rates further. Any increase in interest rate would lead to the stocks and other riskier assets to drop, pushing APE towards the $3.422 support range. Image: CoinCodex Investors and traders should be monitoring the release of the CPI data and how the broader financial market reacts to it. Any major long or short decisions should be made after these indicators are observed. Meanwhile, the current ApeCoin price prediction made by CoinCodex suggests that the value of ApeCoin will increase by 7.90% and reach $4.28 by January 11 of this year. -Featured image: New Scientist",NEUTRAL,APE,BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | TRADING | APE,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/apecoin-recovery-about-to-end/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/7138251.jpeg

7133980,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514992,1672977917,Bitcoin: This Crypto Strategist Foresees A BTC Price Reversal Soon,"Bitcoin analysts are following up on BTC price trends as the 2022 bear market drags into the beginning of 2023. The crypto market is slightly recovering from the FTX fiasco that caused most of the crypto assets to plunge. According to a famous crypto analyst, Kelvin Svenson, one technical indicator could end Bitcoin’s bear market. In a video update, Svenson noted that BTC’s weekly relative strength index (RSI) is about to break out from its diagonal resistance. The RSI measures the ratio of ups and downs movements in the crypto market. As per Svenson, this movement suggests that BTC bulls have started to gather momentum. Furthermore, he noted that the two-year-long market downtrend could end if an RSI breakout occurs. Related Reading: Solana Leads Crypto Market Gains, How Long Will This Continue? Svenson explained the importance of a potential RSI breakout in his video update. Following his prediction, there could be a significant trend shift for BTC if the RSI breakout occurs in the next couple of weeks. Svenson’s Prediction And Bitcoin Price Outlook Svenson cited a weekly RSI breakout towards the end of the BTC bear market in 2018. Pointing at the BTC diagonal resistance line, he added that the market gets bullish once the RSI pops above the resistance level. Given the momentum with which the weekly RSI is coming up, the crypto analyst says BTC is heading toward a significant bull run. Bitcoin is currently trading at $16,831, but Svenson predicts that BTC may rally to $21,000 if the RSI exceeds its long-term resistance. Bitcoin’s current price indicates a potential rise of 25% if it reaches $21,000, which Svenson predicted. The year 2022 marked the beginning of a new bear market for Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin declined nearly 75% since its all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Many analysts made different predictions for Bitcoin prices in 2022. For example, at a tech conference in Amsterdam in 2018, Tim Draper predicted that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by the end of 2022. However, when 2022 finally came, Bitcoin price turned opposite Draper’s prediction. The asset plunged below the $20k mark and hit $16,441 in November after the FTX crisis, but it is now moving toward the $17,000 mark and will likely cross it if the bulls stay intact. Michael Van De Poppe Releases Bullish BTC Price Prediction For 2023 As the new year unfolds, other analysts besides Svesons have projected a new outlook for BTC in 2023. For example, Michael van de Poppe has made a new prediction for BTC prices in 2023. According to the analyst, BTC will experience a massive price surge in the coming months. Related Reading: Bottom Signal: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Falls To Three-Year Lows De Poppe predicts a rally between $30,000 and $35,000 as the U.S. Federal Reserve pauses interest rate hikes and reduce inflation.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Continues Its 2022 Nostalgia Tour  By James Rubin  Bitcoin and ether continued their 2022 nostalgia tours, with the two largest cryptos by market capitalization holding almost precisely where they stood for the last two weeks of December.  BTC was recently trading at about $16,850, flat over the last 24 hours as investors mulled early 2023 economic indicators that seemed at odds and ongoing U.S. central bank resolve to raise interest rates for at least the first part of 2023. Ether followed a similar pattern to trade at just above $1,200, its perch on Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptos also spent much of Wednesday hovering within their most recent ranges.  ADA, the token of the Cardano blockchain, was recently up 1.8%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently inched down 0.19%.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Katie Stockton, managing partner of research group Fairlead Strategies, noted the ""downtrend"" in bitcoin and altcoins. ""Since May or so we've seen them stair step lower,"" Stockton said. ""Right now, we've seen a bit of a plateau. They seem to end with a few days of downside volatility. And then we get into another consolidation phase, the likes of which we've seen over the past seven to eight weeks.""  She added: ""Now, within that context, with the consolidation phase underway within the downtrend, we've obviously not seen any kind of breakouts above resistance.""  On the third trading day of the new year, equity markets slumped with the tech-focused Nasdaq falling 1.5% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping 1.2% and 1%, respectively – reaction to a surprisingly strong report by human resources software and services provider ADP showing employers adding 235,000 jobs in December. The monthly measure of employment markets rekindled fears that the economy was not slowing as much as U.S. central bankers had hoped and undercut hopes stirred by a U.S. Labor Department report showing a slight downturn in overall, available jobs.  Job cuts highlighted crypto news on Thursday. Crypto bank Silvergate Capital (SI) cut 40% of its staff, or about 200 employees, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and beleaguered Genesis Global trading, a subsidiary of crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk's parent company) eliminated about 30% of its workers, taking it down to 145 employees, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Fairlead's Stockton said warily that her group's research strongly suggested that the current consolidation in crypto markets would ""resolve to the downside.""  ""We're not advocating counter-trend positions, given the risks inherent to bear market cycle(s),"" Stockton said, adding: ""We're out there kind of with you looking for signs of a long-term bottom as sort of a major low, and we actually do think that this year will capture a major low, but we just don't have it indications of it quite yet.""

Bitcoin’s Average True Range (ATR), a proxy for measuring volatility in asset prices, has fallen to its lowest point since July 2020.  An asset’s “true range” incorporates its open, high, low, and “closing” price, with the range of the asset representing the absolute value of the largest move between components. A moving average is then calculated over a prescribed time (often 14 days) to determine the ATR.  Bitcoin’s ATR has declined by 88% from its 2022 peak of 2,569, and more than 95% from its all-time peak.  Ether volatility has responded similarly, with its 2022 ATR falling by 84%.

Justin Sun had earlier denied layoff reports.  Reports that Huobi is dramatically cutting headcount, requiring employees to take their salaries in stablecoins and closing internal staff communication channels to quell a rebellion have taken a toll on Huobi’s exchange token and trading volume.  In an interview with Hong Kong’s SCMP, Huobi adviser Justin Sun, who has been representing the company publicly, denied the Huobi layoffs. However, since then a company spokesperson confirmed the exchange's plans to reduce headcount by 20%.  ""With the current state of the bear market, a very lean team will be maintained going forward,"" Kate Li, a spokesperson for the exchange, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.  CoinGecko data shows that Huobi’s HT token has fallen by nearly 11% during the last 24 hours, to $4.67 as of morning East Asia time. The token is down nearly 30% over the past month.  During the last 24 hours, the measurement of normalized volume at the exchange is down 23% to $395 million from $510 million.  News of the layoffs and requirement to take salary in stablecoins was first reported by Colin Wu at WuBlockchain. WuBlockchain reported that those employees who refused to accept being paid in crypto would be dismissed, raising concerns throughout the workforce. Others on Twitter reported that staff had been locked out of internal communications channels.  Concern has also mounted about the quality of Huobi’s reserves in the aftermath of the FTX failure. A recent report from CryptoQuant shows that of all the exchanges, Huobi relies most on its own token to denominate its reserves. About 60% of its reserves are based on things other than its token. Of all exchanges, OKX and Deribit have the cleanest reserves, coming in at 100%, according to CryptoQuant.

Daily active users are stable but not growing and validator growth in 2022 was essentially non-existent. Based on certain valuation metrics, AVAX is actually not as overvalued as some peers. Like all coins/chains in the crypto market, regulatory concerns in the US are a headwind. One of the top Layer 1 blockchains in crypto by market capitalization is Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ). With a $3.7 billion market cap, AVAX is the 18th ranked cryptocurrency by circulating supply. Like other Layer 1 smart contract blockchains, the native coin of the chain is used to pay for transaction fees on the network. In this article, we'll look at some of the on-chain activity in the Avalanche blockchain network to try to make a determination about whether or not it is a good time to buy this coin based on valuation trends. 'ETH Killer' Narrative One of the big reasons why chains like Avalanche exist is because Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has long suffered from scalability issues. I've covered the blockchain trilemma in previous Seeking Alpha articles and I'd invite you to read this one as well if you want more of an explanation about what the trilemma is. But the stripped down version is Ethereum isn't scalable on the base layer in its current form. There are essentially 3 different solutions that have come from that fundamental scalability problem: Developer changes to Ethereum's base layer Secondary scaling layers Entirely different L1 ecosystems Avalanche is one of the top examples of option 3 as it is a different blockchain ecosystem that can work along side Ethereum if we're indeed headed for a multi-chain future. The chain was launched by Ava Labs in 2019. What makes Avalanche different from Ethereum from a technical perspective is that it actually has 3 distinctly different blockchains on the network; each of which are optimized for different types of transactions. This is an interesting attempt at upgrading the efficiency of a base layer blockchain and Avalanche claims the ability to process more than 4,500 transactions per second with the potential capacity to do an infinite amount with the implementation of subnets. This is dramatically more than Ethereum. User Activity Over the last year, Avalanche has seen unique addresses on the blockchain grow from 1.45 million at the end of 2021 to 4.52 million at the end of 2022 - year over year growth of well over 200%. Though the address growth has been good, I want to give a sense of where activity was a year ago versus where it is currently: AVAX DAU Trend, Year Data is Improperly labeled as 20-22 when it is in fact 21-23 (Snowtrace) Despite the large surge in daily actives in mid-October, the overall trend in DAUs (active addresses) has been negative since the collapse of Terra ( LUNC-USD ). An important caveat in this data above is that it is only the C-Chain addresses. Daily active addresses (avax.network) There are active users on the subnets as well, but even when accounting for Dexalot, Swimmer, and DFK subnets, Avalanche's DAUs has still been under 50k for the majority of the last 7 months. Despite that relatively low daily active user figure compared to other Layer 1 smart contract chains, it does appear that the trend has at least somewhat stabilized since last summer. C-Chain Validators (avax.network) Also somewhat stable but also boring is the lack of meaningful growth in validators on the C-chain. The C-chain had grown from 1,148 validators at the end of 2021 to over 1,600 in April. That number has since retreated back to 1,123 at the start of this year. Not exactly a great trend. Valuation Metrics From a valuation standpoint, DeFi metrics are often a good indication if a blockchain native asset has a fair price given the level of value locked on the network. One way to express a valuation multiple is with the market cap to TVL ratio. Rank Network Protocols 1m Change TVL Stables Mcap/TVL 1 Ethereum 628 -1.71% $23.67b $84.88b 6.38 2 Binance 522 -15.76% $4.16b $9.2b 10.09 3 Tron 14 -6.08% $4.1b $33.84b 1.21 4 Arbitrum 161 -0.88% $1.03b $936.28m n/a 5 Polygon 354 -5.07% $1.02b $1.72b 7 6 Avalanche 280 -12.21% $776.88m $1.56b 4.73 7 Optimism 96 -6.98% $509.47m $544.22m 0.43 8 Fantom 271 -9.74% $423.11m $470.05m 1.31 9 Cronos 88 -15.19% $372.5m $425,585 4 10 Mixin 9 -1.45% $262.56m n/a n/a Source: DeFi Llama, as of 1/5/23 From that vantage, Avalanche actually doesn't look too bad compared to Ethereum and Binance (BNB-USD) which both have larger MC/TVL ratios. The higher the ratio, the more overvalued a chain's native asset potentially is. Avalanche has a higher ratio than chains like Tron ( TRX-USD ) or Fantom ( FTM-USD ) but lower than Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. One thing to keep in mind is low MC/TVL doesn't necessarily mean a coin is cheap by itself. It could also be an indication of a one-dimension chain that lacks a diverse set of activities. Another valuation metric to consider is price to sales. 30 Day P/S ratio (Token Terminal) This expresses the market capitalization of a network's token divided by the annualized revenue on the blockchain. Avalanche's multiple of just under 2k is far from the lowest but also superior compared to a couple other chains that have larger market caps. To be clear though, none of these blockchains appear to be heading in the right direction from a P/S valuation trend perspective: Fully diluted P/S ratio (Token Terminal) You can see in the chart above when assessing the full year trend, these chains are largely becoming more expensive rather than cheaper judging by the P/S ratio. This is largely attributable to coin prices that haven't fallen as much as network activity has. Risks Valuation and user growth stagnation are clear risks. But these aren't risks that are exclusive to just Avalanche. Additionally, like all native assets on a public blockchain network, AVAX has risks on the regulatory front. We've seen the current SEC write language implying staked blockchain-based assets are potentially securities under United States jurisdiction because of the geographic location of nodes or validators. Over 40% of Avalanche's validators are in the United States though Germany is a somewhat close second with 27%. Validator Breakout (avascan.info) Which might be an additional risk with 67% of a chain's validation coming from just two countries. If either country decides to take a regulatory course that would be detrimental to staking, the network could be significantly damaged by loss of viable validators. This is absolutely not a risk that is exclusive to Avalanche, but it is a risk to consider given the push for crypto regulations following the FTX collapse ( FTT-USD ). Summary I think those who have followed my work over the last year or so know where I stand on a chain like Ethereum. While I've been keenly aware of the scalability problems and have entertained the idea of competing layer 1 chains like Avalanche, Solana ( SOL-USD ), and several others in the past, my thinking now is Ethereum will probably be the smart contract winner as scalability problems will be solved through some combination of L2 chains and future adaptations to the base layer. That said, I do think competing Layer 1 chains will exist. I just don't imagine the native coins of the networks will ever command the market cap of something like ETH. Avalanche could certainly be a network that survives as the chain construction is interesting. Beyond that, DAUs are low but stable and Avalanche is still a top 10 blockchain by gross NFT sales despite lacking what I think most would view as a 'blue chip' NFT project. Though I do not currently have any exposure to AVAX, it is a token that I've previously owned a very small portion of and I would entertain going long AVAX again at some point in the future if the network activity warranted such a move.",NEUTRAL,AVAX | ETH | BNB,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568158-avalanche-activity-down-but-positive-signs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7125560.jpeg
