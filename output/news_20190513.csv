42402886,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddMC,1557790205,Bitfinex and Tether Ask Court to Loosen NYAG's Fund Restrictions,"Tether has asked a judge for more leeway to use its cash amid the New York Attorney General's investigation of the stablecoin issuer and affiliated crypto exchange Bitfinex.  According to new court documents filed Monday, the attorneys for each side failed to come to a consensus on what, precisely, Tether should be allowed to do with its holdings. The NYAG's office wants to prevent ""any affiliated entity"" from touching funds in Tether's reserve and a 90-day injunction.  On the other hand, attorneys for Tether and iFinex, the parent firm of Bitfinex, want a 45-day injunction and for affiliated entities that want to fairly redeem tether to be able to do so.  The case began last month, when the NYAG secured a preliminary injunction, alleging Bitfinex covered up the loss of $850 million by borrowing from Tether's reserve. (The companies have overlapping management and owners.) A New York State Supreme Court judge ordered the two parties to clarify the order last week.  In a letter to the court Monday, iFinex’s attorneys wrote that, without waiving their previous motion to vacate NYAG’s Ex Parte order entirely, they would agree to certain changes to the preliminary injunction.  The key point, for the crypto exchange, appears to be that it wants to be able to use its stablecoin reserve funds, including for investment purposes.  “If [Tether] simply held the proceeds in cash, the company would not earn the money required to fund its operations,” Bitfinex's attorneys said.  Earning interest  However, in its own letter to the court, attorneys from the NYAG’s office said that “bona fide holders of tether should be able to redeem those tokens for cash, as Tether has long represented to the market,” adding:  “Further, the OAG' s proposed modifications do not restrain Tether from placing the reserves in legitimate interest-bearing or similar cash equivalent accounts, as the OAG understands Tether to have previously done.”  Tether argues that NYAG has no basis for cutting off the ability of tether holders “who happen to be affiliated with Respondents” – including Tether employees – to redeem USDT, and that as a result, the NYAG’s argument presents a “gross overreach,” particularly given that it is not actually a regulator.  NYAG’s attorneys say that they aren’t opposed to Tether’s employees being paid, but that they want the company to pay its employees using transaction fees, rather than its reserves.  Both parties submitted proposed modified orders, which have similar third subparagraphs, but which clearly demonstrate the differences of opinion in subparagraphs 1 and 2.  Judge Joel M. Cohen, who is overseeing the case, will likely schedule a hearing to reconcile the different proposals in the coming days, though it was not immediately clear just when that would be.

42402892,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddQ8,1557785178,"Up $1,200 on the Day, Bitcoin's Price Surges Above $8K","Bitcoin’s price has continued to extend its recent rally to a price level beyond $8,000.  At 21:30 UTC today, the price world’s largest cryptocurrency rose as high as $8,195 on Coinbase, marking a 17.4 percent or $1214 increase during today's trading session.  In the past 24 hours alone, Messari data reveals more than $27 billion worth of bitcoin was traded across exchanges, whereas $2,1 billion was traded solely on the 10 exchanges Bitwise Asset Management identified as the only exchanges reporting honest volume figures.  While vigorous, today’s development is not an anomaly. In fact, bitcoin's price increases have been aggressive for much of 2019 and rose more than $1000 dollars once again just two days ago.  In the past 90-days alone the cryptocurrency has increased 127 percent in price, nearly 60 percent of which was accrued in the last 30 days alone, Messari data reveals.  The USD value of most cryptocurrencies are seeing notable increases as a result of bitcoin’s rebound, including the likes of Binance Coin (BNB) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) both of whom are reporting double-digit 24-hour gains.  That said, bitcoin's percent share of the capitalization of the total cryptocurrency market is now a 60 percent - its highest since Dec. 11, 2017 according to Coinmarketcap, and a sign its growth is outpacing the rest of the broader market.  History repeating?  Interestingly, a very similar and parabola shaped price increase like the one bitcoin has just witnessed occurred at the end of the previous bear market in 2015.  As can be seen below, bitcoin's price trend entered a parabolic rise after reaching a low of $198 on Aug. 25, 2015 followed by a near 150 percent increase before temporarily topping out at $499 on Nov. 4th of that year.  Indeed, history seems to be repeating itself, or at least rhyming, as bitcoin's market has once again entered a parabolic structure having increased nearly 150 percent from its most recent low of $3,128 set on Dec. 15, 2018.

42402904,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddZy,1557783380,SEC's Crypto Czar Says Exchanges That List IEOs May Face Legal Risks,"Certain exchanges that facilitate initial exchange offerings (IEOs) may be breaking U.S. securities laws, a top Securities and Exchange Commission official has said.  Speaking Monday at CoinDesk's Consensus 2019 conference in New York, Valerie Szczepanik, the SEC's senior advisor for digital assets and innovation, said cryptocurrency exchanges that facilitate token sales for a fee likely meet the legal definition of securities dealers if the issuer or any of the buyers are based in the U.S.  As such, they need to follow the registration and licensing requirements for broker-dealers, alternative trading systems (ATS) or national securities exchanges. And if they're not, they're going to be in hot water, according to Szczepanik.  “Platforms seeking to list these tokens for a listing fee or bring buyers to the table for issuers are probably engaging in broker-dealer activity,"" Szczepanik said during a chat with Bloomberg reporter Matthew Leising, adding:  ""If they are not registered they will find themselves in trouble in the U.S., if they have a U.S. issuer or U.S. buyers, if they are operating on the U.S. market.""  Szczepanik did not mention any specific exchanges. However, Binance, OKEx, Bittrex and KuCoin are among the exchanges that have facilitated IEOs, and these transactions are believed to be generating millions of dollars in fees for such platforms.  The most famous platform for IEOs is Binance's Launchpad, which in January hosted a public sale of BitTorrent tokens, raising $7.4 million for the file-sharing service owned by Tron.  Szczepanik said a previous case brought by the SEC last year against TokenLot ""was instructive in this regard.""  ""There was a platform that was assisting to bring buyers to ICOs,"" she said. ""In this case, there was an enforcement action, as the platform was acting as a broker-dealer and participating in the distribution with a violation of the registration provisions.”  Watch CoinDesk's IEO explainer below:  Valerie Szczepanik, right, at Consensus 2019 image via Anna Baydakova for CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB | BTT | TOKEN SALE,"Anna Baydakova, Marc Hochstein",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/13/secs-crypto-czar-says-exchanges-that-list-ieos-may-face-legal-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a354f57950358785a35c261f79a0b036d6fd6624-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402898,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddW2,1557781203,Nym Technologies Raises $2.5 Million to Anonymize Crypto Apps,"A privacy-centric startup has turned to a private token sale to raise $2.5 million.  The seed round in Nym Technologies involved NEO Global Capital, Lemniscap, Edenblock and others. Binance Labs, where Nym completed a 10-week incubation program late last year, is also an investor.  “Token sales are not dead,” Lemniscap managing partner Roderik van der Graaf told CoinDesk. “We still believe there are such things as properly designed crypto networks with tokens.”  Nym Technologies CEO Harry Halpin told CoinDesk the company plans to launch a testnet by 2020. He declined to specify which blockchain the startup's native token is based on in the meantime.  ""The primary thesis is that we can incentivize privacy-enhancing features,"" Halpin said of his startup's token-centric approach. ""If I run a VPN [today] I can get paid but then I have to hold all the financial data of my users.""  Nym wants to “anonymize the world,” Halpin has said, with software that can be applied to crypto wallets and other mobile apps to mask IP addresses and user data from the network itself. Bitcoin veteran Amir Taaki is already working on integrating this capability with his Dark Wallet project.  “We’re building the protocols and other people will provision the infrastructure,” Halpin said. “We believe our system should allow users to pay as they want, using fair prices for whatever services people want to provide.”  The token economics of the platform are still under development, however, according to Nym investor Lasse Clausen of 1kx.  “On a basic level there will be a staking token,” Clausen told CoinDesk.  Halpin told CoinDesk the token will mainly be used for fees, to reward node operators and staking for service providers.  “In my opinion, the tokens will of course be important,” he said. “Their importance comes from their utility due to their ability to help other tokens improve their privacy.”  So far, according to Edenblock partner Lior Messika, NYM tokens are basically vouchers for future use of privacy-enhanced services, such as sending a certain number of messages within a messaging service or using a certain capacity of data through a VPN service.  Web3 Foundation director Ryan Zurrer told CoinDesk that the broader industry sorely needs authentication software that isn’t controlled by centralized entities.  Nym’s infrastructure solutions could address that demand by helping product and service providers avoid collecting user data, a vision that coincides with the cypherpunk ethos.  Indeed, after Facebook acquired the blockchain startup Chainspace, Chainspace founder Dave Hrycyszyn joined Nym Technologies instead.  “Here’s a privacy project, that’s what I like,” Hrycyszyn told CoinDesk.  Speaking to the broader point of protecting user privacy, van der Graaf added:  “[Nym’s] protocol doesn’t only anonymize at the protocol layer but also the network layer. So that is a major difference compared to something like Tor. They even mix the data packets at the network layer therefore anonymizing metadata such as IP addresses, geolocations, etc. It’s really one step ahead of the solutions that are out there at the moment.”  Image of the Nym Technologies team – Including (left to right) Harry Halpin, Ania Piotrowska, Jedrzej Stuczynski, Jonathan King and Dave Hrycyszyn – courtesy of the company",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/05/13/nym-technologies-raises-25-million-to-anonymize-crypto-apps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c64f3dd906fe904228fe48131661f40a9515fe21-1384x837.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) to ban cryptocurrency purchases in the U.S. is a terrible idea.  Appearing on CoinDesk Live at Consensus 2019, Paul discussed a number of topics surrounding the cryptocurrency space, including his belief that the federal government should leave the it alone.  ""Detail wise, I don't know what they're doing yesterday or today, but I do know they're watching,"" he said. ""Whether it’s gold or peanuts or silver or whatever, they will not just give cryptocurrencies a free ride.""  He dismissed Sherman's call for a ban during a Congressional hearing on May 9. ""I look for colleagues to join with me in introducing a bill to outlaw cryptocurrency purchases by Americans,"" Sherman said at the time.  Paul called the House Financial Services Committee member ""just another thug in Washington.""  ""They happen to believe they know what is best and they will run the show. They want to be the boss, they’re dictators, and he’s not unusual,"" he said, adding:  ""He’s very typical in all degrees in all issues, whether it’s a social issue, like a few years ago when they decided the worst thing in the world is smoking marijuana.""  ""People like him are driven by power,"" he said.  ""I think anarchy comes from the Brad Shermans of the world, because they break down the world and that’s how you have anarchy in [Venezuela], because of [too much government],"" he said.  He noted that one of the reasons lawmakers and regulators may be looking at cryptocurrencies in particular is due to the fact that they ""challenge the status quo of the monetary system.    .@ronpaul is on #CoinDeskLIVE at #Consensus2019. Ron Paul. https://t.co/tGLAzxeH02        — CoinDesk (@coindesk) May 13, 2019      New vs old  That being said, Paul indicated that the present U.S. monetary system and economy may be running on borrowed time, citing high debt levels as one example.  ""The system we have today is not viable, it’s out of control, the amount of debt that’s building up we might end up with the dollar but not the system,"" he said, pointing to issues such as social, military and corporate welfare as reasons for this.  ""That is the system, and we are flat out broke, we've been broke for some time,"" he said. ""There will be liquidation, when the debt gets this big, the debt has to disappear.""  Crypto may play a role in preventing this he said, adding:  ""I don't know how it will evolve and I don’t know the technology but I’m enthusiastic about the alternatives and the competition and the … way it’s set up, that’s what they promised, is limitations.""  That being said, the main challenge is ""choice.""  Individuals need to be able to develop and use alternatives, he said.  Asked what sort of cryptocurrency policy he might have if he was running for president, Paul said he would advocate for what is essentially a light-touch regulatory regime, saying:  ""I can only speak for myself but I think it’s pretty important is not to come in and the first two to three options on cryptocurrency are 'one’s better than another and we want to manage it,' no, you turn it loose … you try to keep the government out of it as much as possible.""  ""There’s probably more regulators on the financial markets than I would have but if you didn’t have anybody punishing people who defrauded people, there’s still a lot of fraud,"" he said, though he noted that regulations haven't prevented fraud either.  Ideally, he'd like to decentralize regulatory authority, so that agencies based in Washington, D.C. or New York City don't control the rest of the nation's startups and businesses.  ""Government should be so small that nobody has a financial advantage to being there,"" he said.

42402907,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddddu,1557774040,Kadena to Go Live in October With $3 Billion Asset Manager Onboard,"Brooklyn-based startup Kadena will launch a public blockchain this October, the company announced Monday at CoinDesk's Consensus 2019 conference in New York.  Founded in 2016, Kadena raised over $14 million last year to develop a new proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain network called Chainweb that would seek to offer users high transaction volumes without slowing down network speed and ramping up network cost for users.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO of Kadena Will Martino, said:  “Chainweb is built to align the incentives of everyone involved in the network. For the first time, miners, users and businesses can all agree on what network success means and how to get there from launch.”  Chainweb's protocol, the company said, links multiple blockchain networks to run concurrently and split up large computation loads. As previously reported, these different chains share information through Merkle roots to achieve cross-chain consensus.  The envisioned goal of Chainweb is to produce roughly 1,000 different blockchains and reach networks speed of up to 10,000 transactions per second.  According to Kadena CEO Will Martino, Chainweb has been running on a test network since March. Later this summer in May, the test network will be opened up to preliminary users.  ""We have a mining queue that we will slowly begin on-boarding to test the user experience and the process of hooking up to the network,"" said Martino to CoinDesk.  Martino stressed that miners would not be earning tokens ahead of their market release by engaging in the preliminary test network. Today's press release notes that miners will strictly ""get to learn how Chainweb works and collaborate with our team to scale the network.""  Along with today's announcement, the team at Kadena further revealed a partnership with commodities and alternative investment products provider USCF Investments, a manager of approximately $3 billion in assets.  John Love, president and CEO of USCF, told CoinDesk:  ""One of the things that attracted us to Kadena was their expertise beyond just blockchain and fintech including...regulatory understanding. To our business, this [partnership] wasn't something coming from left field. This collaboration makes a lot of sense to tie our respective areas of expertise together.""  As Martino put, the two will be working together to build ""the next generation of fintech"" by leveraging Kadena products like Chainweb.  ""The key is that USCF brings this history of innovating in financial markets and a vision for how a new technology [like blockchain] could fundamentally advance how these systems and these products are built [in fintech],"" said Martino to CoinDesk.

42402894,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddR7,1557766842,"Tor Makes Launching Bitcoin Lightning Nodes Easier for Users, Casa Finds","The privacy-minded network Tor helps users to leapfrog one of the trickier aspects of setting up a bitcoin and lightning node, according to bitcoin startup Casa.  Casa CTO Jameson Lopp addressed this point during a talk at CoinDesk's Consensus 2019 conference, where he discussed what Casa has learned about its product – a plug-and-play bitcoin and lightning node that aims to make it easier for users to run the software.  People often funnel their node network traffic through the Tor network to improve privacy, as the network shields the IP address of the node (which can show where it is located). Tor's usefulness in this scenario is interesting because, in addition to this, such an approach helps users blast through some of the thorny networking hurdles that come with setting up a node.  As Lopp stated:  ""With Tor, we were able to punch through all these networking issues.""  Casa added Tor support back in April. While it may sound contradictory, one of the biggest issues when setting up a Casa full node (which Lopp said takes up a ""significant portion"" of staff support time) is making sure that other nodes can see it on the network. To do so, users need to set up ""port forwarding.""  In theory, this should be a simple process. A user just plugs in the port number the node is running on into their router's port forwarding website. But users have all sorts of problems, Lopp said, since there are ""hundreds of thousands"" of different routers with different settings, and some are easier to set up than others.  Casa has tried a ""universal plug and play"" setting to help with this issue, but Lopp said it ""works in like less than 50 percent of cases,"" whereas Tor just routes around the problem altogether.  There is one negative aspect to using Tor, however.  ""The only downside is you have to get a Tor browser,"" Lopp said, which he admitted is not the easiest process. But between using Tor and trying to deal with a router's port forwarding configuration, Lopp believes the choice is obvious.  ""It’s easier to do that than going through all this networking complexity,"" he said.

Agoric, which launched last year, is working to develop a blockchain-agnostic programming language specifically for smart contracts. The language, which is based on javascript, will allow programmers to conduct formal verification processes while still being more easily accessible than other languages used for blockchains today.  In a press release, the company announced it had secured new funding from Ripple's Xpring, gumi Cryptos Capital, Kilowatt Capital, MetaStable Capital, Outlier Ventures, Lemniscap, Rockaway Blockchain and the Interchain Foundation, as well as additional funding from Naval Ravikant and Polychain.  The startup intends to double the size of its team with the new funding, targeting the engineering and business development aspects as it prepares to bring its technology to market.  Agoric's next specific goal is to launch a testnet, as well as ""build out interoperability with top-tier next-generation decentralized projects.""

Dubbed Polymesh, the new platform will be designed specifically for companies that want to create regulation-compliant security tokens, Polymath co-founder Trevor Koverko announced Monday at CoinDesk's Consensus 2019. In theory, a purpose-built blockchain will help spur adoption of security tokens by streamlining the process for companies looking to launch tokenized assets.  Hoskinson  , who also co-founded ethereum and cardano, will be Polymesh's ""co-architect,"" according to a press statement.  Polymath, a security token platform, has already supported the launch of 120 different security tokens, the release noted, but their actual adoption remains low when compared to the rest of the crypto ecosystem.  Compliance with regulations is one reason why, the company contends. It noted that Polymath's security tokens were built on ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  Ethereum's goal of enabling ""unstoppable applications"" runs counter to the point of most security tokens. As such, developers working on Polymesh will consider what capital markets may actually need when building the network.  In a statement, Hoskinson said he was ""looking forward to working on Polymesh,"" adding:  ""There are quadrillions of dollars of financial securities, and building a blockchain to secure them is an incredibly exciting task.""  Koverko added in a statement that Polymath was excited to work with Hoskinson ""on the world's first purpose-built blockchain for security tokens.""

42402887,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddNB,1557759613,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Publishes Latest Client Specs in Blockchain Standards Push,"Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), the standards body seeking a common approach for businesses using ethereum's code, has released a third version of its client specification, as well as updates on privacy and performance.  Announced Monday at CoinDesk's Consensus 2019 conference, EEA released its Enterprise Ethereum Client Specification V3, which simplifies permissioning systems, inherent to enterprise blockchains and a range of other recommendations.  Also released was the latest details on how to connect with and integrate a particular subset of privacy and scaling methods covered by the “Off-Chain Trusted Compute Specification V1.”  Because of the way blockchains like ethereum tend to broadcast (and replicate) a lot of information, trusted off-chain execution improves overall throughput of the main chain and also protects data confidentiality.  This covers hardware-based trusted execution environments, trusted multi-party-compute systems (which combine hardware and software), zero knowledge proofs and also soc-called “attested oracles”, external data sources which update smart contracts on the blockchain.  Conor Svensson, EEA Technical Specification Working Group chair and the founder and CEO of Web3 Labs described the work in terms of a “common vocabulary”, telling CoinDesk:  “The specifications provide a common technical baseline for the underlying blockchain technology platform. They also provide a common vocabulary to describe core properties of blockchain systems.”  Svensson said properties such as finality and Byzantine fault tolerance are considerations for any consortia network supporting multiple use cases, as well as approaches to permissioning.  “This common vocabulary is important to give precise meaning to how blockchain systems can actually facilitate different use cases,” he said.  The three ‘Ps’  Since coming out with its first client specification back in May of 2018, the EEA’s work has tracked certain technical processes also being worked up in public ethereum.  John Whelan, EEA chairman and head of digital investment banking at Banco Santander, summed up the group’s focus in terms of the “three Ps of enterprise ethereum”; these are its performance, permissioning, and privacy demands.  Whelan told CoinDesk:  “We have gone through three iterations of the spec now and the idea is to really get us to a point where ethereum software designed for use in the enterprise that meets that spec can legitimately claim to be enterprise ready, whether that's a bank, a telco, an energy company, a logistics company – you name it.”  The EEA’s work is not about delivering a “one size fits all” added Whelan, but rather suggesting an approach when building something that will likely have some degree of interoperability with other similar software. For instance, there are different ways to achieve privacy, noted Whelan, adding:  “You can keep data off-chain or you can encrypt data on-chain, and this particular EEA specification caters to both forms of privacy, off-chain and on-chain privacy as being suitable. It's not a question of one or the other; you can choose to implement both if you are an enterprise ethereum vendor.”  It seems clear now that the enterprise blockchain world will consist of a number of ledgers. As well as ethereum variants, there are going to be R3 Corda implementations, Hyperledger Fabric etc, noted Whelan.  The first step for EEA is connecting and creating interoperability between the different enterprise ethereum variants such as those deployed by firms like Clearmatics, Consensys, BlockApps and JP Morgan’s Quorum, said Whelan.

42402889,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddP9,1557757445,Bakkt Sets July Test Date for Bitcoin Futures,"Bitcoin futures exchange Bakkt announced Monday that it is moving forward with plans to launch physically-settled bitcoin futures products.  In a blog post, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler wrote that Bakkt had ""worked closely"" with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the regulatory agency in charge of overseeing derivatives products in the country, and would be testing its bitcoin futures contracts this summer.  No launch date was announced, and indeed, Loeffler did not explicitly say that the company's proposal to self-custody its bitcoin and clear through its parent company's warehouse (Intercontinental Exchange's ICE Clear US) had been approved.  Rather, Bakkt, through ICE, will self-certify its bitcoin futures products, meaning that the CFTC will have to assess whether or not the proposals violate any laws or regulations. If the regulator does not find any issues within a 10-day deadline, the products will move forward.  This is different from asking the CFTC to explicitly approve a product, which Bakkt was previously said to be doing. CME and Cboe both self-certified their bitcoin futures contracts when they were first announced in 2017.  However, unlike CME and Cboe's products, Bakkt will deliver actual bitcoin, rather than the cash equivalent, upon a contract's expiration.  The company did not announce a final launch date, but should be able to proceed should the CFTC not raise any objections.  According to the CFTC's Rules and Rule Amendments webpage, the regulator has 10 business days to review the proposed products.  ICE published two documents Monday, detailing the listing and self-certification of its two new products.  In the blog post, Loeffler wrote that ""we’ll be working with our customers over the next several weeks to prepare for user acceptance testing (UAT) for futures and custody, which we expect to start in July.""  ""We expect to use UAT to ensure that customers have time to onboard and can test the trading and custody model we’ve built to their satisfaction,"" she wrote, adding that future details will be shared in upcoming posts.  New products  Still, Loeffler shared some new information about Bakkt's upcoming products.  For one thing, the firm will list two different futures contracts: a daily settlement bitcoin future, ""which will enable customers to transact in a same-day market,"" and a monthly futures contract. This is different from the one-day futures contract that the platform originally announced.  Specifically, the firm's new products will be:  A daily settlement bitcoin future, ""which will enable customers to transact in a same-day market;""  And a monthly futures contract, which is different from the one-day futures contract that the platform originally announced.  Bakkt will also place $35 million of its own funding into the clearinghouse risk waterfall, which ""puts our own 'skin in the game' and aligns our interests for market integrity and safety with market participants,"" Loeffler wrote.  In addition, Bakkt plans to use its own qualified custodian to provide custody services, though this remains subject to regulatory approval.  Part of this effort will revolve around Bakkt's efforts to secure a trust company license with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), rather than secure a federal license.

42402899,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddX1,1557756003,"You Can Now 'Spedn' Bitcoin at GameStop, Barnes & Noble and More","On Monday, the payment processing startup Flexa announced the release of its new custodial crypto wallet SPEDN, which allows users to spend bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash or GUSD at a variety of brick-and-mortar retailers.  Although the merchants receive fiat in the end, the partnership enables new possibilities for people looking to spend crypto as easily as they might use Apple Pay.  Flexa co-founder Trevor Filter told CoinDesk the wallet app works at Nordstrom, Barnes & Noble, Express, Lowe’s, GameStop, Office Depot, Regal Cinemas and Jamba Juice, just to name a few. None of the merchants responded to requests for comment, but CoinDesk was able to confirm the deals.  Sarah Olsen, head of business development at Gemini, told CoinDesk the exchange company is partnering to provide security for the custodial wallet. In return, the app now provides a new way for stablecoin users to use GUSD beyond trading.  “Whether that’s a foreigner who’s coming to the U.S. and more easily able to participate in our economy or vice versa,” Olsen said, adding:  “The Flexa network is going to be open source so if you’re a merchant anywhere you can integrate to use their network, even without necessarily interacting with the Flexa team directly. This is going to be the first step toward the future of how we transact value.""  Indeed, Flexa co-founder Tyler Spalding told CoinDesk the ability to spend cryptocurrency can actually boost its function as a store of value.  “You need the other ecosystem to exist,” Spalding said of bitcoin’s value being tied to utility that includes, but isn’t limited to, trading.  Plus, users don’t need to have a credit card or bank account to use this mobile app. A 2017 study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found that 8.4 million American households were unbanked. Filter said that the eventual goal is to bring buyers and sellers closer together with a digitally native payments system. For now, Flexa’s crypto exchange partnerships manage conversion on the backend.  “We’re actually building payment rails on top of cryptocurrency instead of just trying to integrate cryptocurrency into the payment rails that already exist,” Filter said.

42402897,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddV3,1557753508,"Ex-Tron CTO Denies Justin Sun’s Accusations of Embezzlement, Bribery","The former CTO of Tron, who left the project to launch a competing blockchain, has denied accusations of embezzlement, bribery and infringement that were levied by Tron founder Justin Sun.  The dispute between the two emerged after Zhiqiang Chen announced in a May 10 Medium post that since his departure from Tron in January 2019, he has been building ""a new TRON"" called Volume Network.  Chen, who joined Tron in late 2017 as its technology chief shortly after following an initial coin offering, said he feels “very sad” that Tron is, in his view, no longer decentralized. He said the delegated proof-of-stake mechanism Tron uses is “pseudo-decentralized,” adding:  “The top 27 SR nodes (block nodes) have more than 170 million TRX votes, and most of them are controlled by TRON.”  ""The technology platform of TRON was built by me,"" he added. ""I certainly know that the real Internet applications cannot function in TRON network at all currently. The TRON ecosystem is still far from commercial applications.""  According to the white paper of Chen’s Volume Network, major team members of the project also come from Tron, including Xiaodong Xie, a former Tron blockchain developer, as well as Jinchao Zhu, a former dapp product manager at Tron.  Sun's accusations  At the heart of Sun's accusations is the contention that Chen and others violated the law as well as company rules, asserting that the group had been fired in January 2019 following ""verification done by TRON's discipline department.""  Chen’s post appears to have drawn backlash from Tron’s Justin Sun, who said via his Weibo account on May 11 that Chen, Zhu and Xie were fired in January with a series of allegations against them.  As Sun said on Weibo:  “According to verification done by TRON’s discipline department, Z. Chen, J. Zhu, X. Xie had seriously violated laws and company rules with alleged corporate property embezzlement, bribery, non-compete violation, infringement of corporate trade secrets and intellectual properties, and had been fired in January 2019. TRON has submitted relevant materials to the justice department. Chen joined Tron in October 2017. Before he was fired in January 2019, he was an ordinary employee on the technical side and was not a co-founder.”  However, Sun himself did refer to Chen as the CTO of Tron in a June 2018 Twitter post.  Sun did not specify what material or evidence Tron has obtained and submitted or to which ""justice department"" he was referring.  Chen pushes back  On Sunday, May 12, Volume Network published a second blog post in response to Sun’s accusations. Further, Chen said he would consider either a civil or criminal lawsuit against Sun for libel and defamation if he continues to make such accusations.  When reached for comment by CoinDesk, Chen said he denies all of Sun’s allegations.  “If I am really a suspected criminal, it is too late to ‘run away,’ [and] I should not create a new blockchain project ... and find technical talents to join my team, shouldn’t I?” he said in the blog post, stating:  “I hereby make a solemn statement: Justin takes personal attacks and slanders to me again, I will return with legal actions.”  To deny Sun’s characterization of him as just an “ordinary tech guy,” Chen also linked to a Tron GitHub repository from April 2018 with his name listed as the company’s CTO.  “To be frank, I surprised that I turned into ‘the employee of the technology department’ overnight,"" he further stated. ""As Justin’s point of view who has immigrated to the United States, technicity is just the most insignificant and ordinary ‘workers’, which are tools to make money for him.

Uphold will also implement a new ""strong, multi-authorization governance model, ensuring there are no single points of failure in the management of customer funds,"" a press release stated.  Uphold will also provide support for new ERC-20 based stablecoins and other ""proxy assets.""  Ledger Vault global head Demetrios Skalkotos told CoinDesk that what Ledger Vault is providing is infrastructure, noting that the company is just a technology provider, not a custodian.  ""We’re trying to provide a technology infrastructure, both software security integrated with secure elements and hardware,"" he said.  Uphold co-founder J.P. Thieriot told CoinDesk that most of what Ledger is providing will remain ""under the hood,"" meaning customers will likely not notice much of a difference in their user experience.  Describing Uphold as a ""security- and compliance-first kind of company,"" Thieriot told CoinDesk that the company performed an exhaustive search of hardware providers before choosing Ledger.  “We’ve been okay so far but we’ve been searching for solutions for custody and after a deep search, we settled on Ledger,” he said. “They were the right mix for us.”  The company wants to improve its user experience to the point where clients would feel comfortable storing their savings with Uphold (rather than a traditional bank), Thieriot said. Ensuring security is therefore a key focus:  ""It’s always been our view that security’s been the most important issue with respect to mass adoption with cryptocurrencies and blockchain in general ... The only reason people would take a risk of moving their money away from the boring old bank on the corner is if they can derive benefits [from] taking the plunge.""  Skalkotos said Ledger would continue improving its cold storage tools, which also grant customers the ability to monitor or access their funds at any time.  “When things are moving amongst the ecosystems that’s when they’re at their most vulnerable and we’re working hard to secure those movements,” Skalkotos said. “People should have instant access to their funds, they should control their funds and not compromise security doing so.”  Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/13/uphold-integrates-ledger-tools-to-boost-crypto-storage-solution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f17b9a8f13ac8c41c9c2147044d58cdfccf4916d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402884,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddLD,1557752509,PAX Streamlines Redemptions in Battle for Stablecoin Market Share,"Most crypto companies avoid comparisons to traditional banks. But Chad Cascarilla, CEO of the stablecoin issuer Paxos, welcomes the analogy.  “It’s akin to a bank account,” Cascarilla said, describing the new integration of Paxos wallets to the sister company itBit, a crypto exchange. “It has the look and feel in part of a bank account, in part of a custody account.”  As part of this new user interface, Paxos accounts now allow users to instantly redeem PAX dollar-backed stablecoins, which were previously only redeemable a few hours a day. The Paxos team said so far this stablecoin has facilitated $19.5 billion worth of transactions.  Stepping back, in 2018 Paxos and Gemini both ran incentive programs for their rival stablecoins, PAX and GUSD. Despite discounts on their dollar-pegged tokens, both assets failed to claim much market share from the godfather stablecoin, the partially dollar-backed token called Tether, and its scandal-riddled sister exchange Bitfinex.  Although so far Tether’s reign appears impervious to setbacks and continues to trade at high volumes, Paxos is focusing on making it easier to redeem PAX.  “I would say that recently it hasn’t been too bad to redeem,” an OTC trader, who asked to remain anonymous in order to protect his relationship with Paxos, told CoinDesk. “At the begining there was some pushback on it but it’s died down.”  Traders told CoinDesk in February 2019 that both Gemini and Paxos, to a lesser degree, were making it difficult to redeem their respective stablecoins for fiat.  Especially now with the automated feature, traders are able to redeem much faster and without the hindrance of internal politics. A second anonymous OTC trader said:  “I really appreciate that [PAX] is easily convertible to dollars.”  Perhaps there never was much competition between Tether more heavily regulated stablecoins. The second OTC trader said most Tether users aren’t looking for the “architecture and the framework” of a traditional bank like Paxos has. On the other hand, both institutional traders found Paxos’ level of security and compliance very appealing.  Gemini’s platform was deemed equally reliable. (The exchange company declined to comment for this article.) Yet the first OTC trader said there is hardly any appetite in the market for either GUSD or the newest contender in the stablecoin wars, the ethereum-backed DAI token.  “GUSD is basically dead in the water,” the trader said. “DAI hasn’t been doing well for a long time. You can see this in its liquidity, which is truly atrocious. DAI order books are really, shockingly thin.”  Speaking of the rare DAI traders, he added:  “Those are OGs who want to hold their DAI contracts and do it for political reasons.”  The dark horse in this stablecoin race has always been Coinbase’s dollar-backed token, USDC. The second OTC trader said over the past several weeks, since New York regulators clashed with Bitfinex over undisclosed documents related to Tether, there has been some modest increase in demand for both PAX and USDC.  “I think that the people that use Tether and that whole ecosystem have shown to be pretty resilient,” he said. “But there are people who use the other stablecoins on more regulated trading markets.”  Chad Cascarilla image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,DAI,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT | DAI,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/13/pax-streamlines-redemptions-in-battle-for-stablecoin-market-share,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42402901,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddYz,1557752430,Microsoft Launches Decentralized Identity Tool on Bitcoin Blockchain,"Microsoft is launching the first decentralized infrastructure implementation by a major tech company that is built directly on the bitcoin blockchain.  The open source project, called Ion, deals with the underlying mechanics of how networks talk to each other. For example, if you log onto Airbnb using Facebook, a protocol deals with the software that sends the personal information from your social profile to that external service provider. In this case, Ion handles the decentralized identifiers, which control the ability to prove you own the keys to this data.  Christopher Allen, a crypto veteran and the co-founder of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) working group for decentralized identity (DID) solutions, told CoinDesk that Microsoft’s move could impact the entire tech industry.  “A lot of enterprise infrastructures use Microsoft products,” Allen said. ""So if they integrate this into any of their infrastructure products, they'll have access to DID.”  Indeed, Yorke Rhodes, a program manager on Microsoft’s blockchain engineering team, told CoinDesk that Microsoft’s team has been working for a year on a key signing and validation software that relies on public networks, like bitcoin or ethereum, yet can handle far greater throughput than the underlying blockchain itself.  Underscoring the fact that Microsoft was a founding member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation, Rhodes said:  “There are systems that we have at Microsoft that give you permissions in an enterprise context, a product called Active Directory, that we think need to be able to recognize these DIDs as well.”  He added such infrastructure products and services related to Azure are among the Microsoft’s most popular offerings. This tiny piece in a giant machine, then, could have far-reaching impacts.  Meanwhile, an anonymous source with knowledge of Microsoft’s project told CoinDesk that Ion will shift from using bitcoin’s testnet to the bitcoin mainnet later this year. As such, any tech-savvy observer could run a node and contribute to this project.  Said W3C’s Allen:  “To have Microsoft say they are not scared of bitcoin, and in fact, it has some very good properties and we are willing to take advantage of those properties, is, I think, a step in the right direction.”  Stepping back, the difference between a DID under the hood, versus current infrastructure, speaks to the heart of users owning their own content and access. In the example of Facebook and Airbnb, with a DID, Facebook might be able to shut down your social media account but could not revoke access to all the tools that relied on the Facebook ID to log in. Plus, all those personal photos on Facebook would belong to the user, the holder of the DID.  Yet Facebook, in particular, may not align with Microsoft’s approach.  Another anonymous source told CoinDesk that although Facebook has been invited to participate in Microsoft’s DID projects and community efforts, so far the social media company has declined and instead continued to follow its historic approach to user data.  “They’re going in a different direction that’s not as decentralized,” the source said of Facebook.  Corporate conflicts  The Wall Street Journal and others have reported that Facebook is looking to build a stablecoin-based payments platform for the social network. Yet Allen said he hasn’t seen any effort from Facebook to support DID standards or community efforts such as W3C, which may create a rift with corporations like Microsoft that are making such standards a core pillar of their business model.  Rouven Heck, head of DID at ConsenSys and active member of the W3C, told CoinDesk that Facebook is noticeably absent from community discussions across the tech industry about DIDs.  And although Rhodes said he was not aware of any dealings with Facebook, there was clearly a misalignment between the two company’s goals for using blockchain technology.  “Facebook is the complete antithesis of consumer privacy,” he said. “Their business model is based on the fact they can monetize data about you.”  What's more, U.S. Senate Banking Committee last week wrote a letter to Facebook that voiced concerns about how the social media company will handle financial data with its crypto project, which is codenamed Libra. Few details about Libra have been shared to date outside of press reports.  In the past, Allen said that Facebook only implemented parts of protocols that enabled data sharing “in a proprietary way that only benefited” Facebook.  With regards to what approach the social media giant will take to blockchain systems, a Facebook spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “Like many other companies, Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology. This new small team is exploring many different applications. We don’t have anything further to share.”  Ethical capitalism  In contrast to the allegations that Facebook is taking a different direction with its project, both ConsenSys and Microsoft are opting to make open source initiatives core pillars of their respective business models.  “If we can create certain standards it will help the system to build up faster, and that’s good for all of us,” Heck said. “The different products we have are all useful across the space and not built into some proprietary niche.”  Rhodes agrees with this approach, saying that engaging with the open source ecosystem serves Microsoft’s business objectives. He said the “philosophy of consumer ownership and consumer centricity” are core principles for designing Microsoft’s software going forward.  Allen said he hopes a sense of public responsibility will continue to be viewed as a competitive advantage – especially as Microsoft Azure goes head-to-head with Amazon Web Services for cloud market share.  “You could have a service that is in the cloud hosted by Microsoft Azure, but is absolutely secure because everything in it is encrypted with your keys that you control and everything that run under your authority, even though it’s in the cloud,” Allen said.  In Rhodes’ opinion, current experiments with blockchain technology are comparable to Microsoft releasing Windows 95 in decades past, which helped boost mainstream internet usage through a consumer-oriented operating system.  “Networking stacks were very tied to logins to existing networks,” Rhodes said of the pre-Windows 95 internet. “Like that, I think [Ion] is pretty significant.”  Microsoft image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/13/microsoft-launches-decentralized-identity-tool-on-bitcoin-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0c03e76faef114934e323ede8f804f0787c5e13-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Avtar Sehra, CEO of Nivaura, told CoinDesk:  “Some of the key clients that we are working with on the novel aspects around FRNs and tokenized registers are LSEG, Santander and LeasePlan.”  Nivaura, which recently closed a $20 million seed round led by LSEG, has participated in all five ""sandbox"" cohorts of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. The regulator's program explores ways to issue digital assets in a compliant fashion and use public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum as a settlement layer.  Back in 2016, Nivaura executed a reinsurance instrument which managed a register of noteholders using an on-chain token allocation system (sometime before the popularity of this approach took hold in the ICO explosion), while also creating a “calculation and paying agent” smart contract on ethereum.  The firm is now applying the same approach to FRNs, using a money market data feed to trigger a calculation. FRNs are calculated according to current market rates, such as the federal funds rate or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a quoted spread (a typical coupon would look like ""3 months USD LIBOR +0.20%"").  Sehra said the FRN project is a useful extension of the work his team has done to tokenize equity, and for that to then be transferable on a regulated exchange.  Tokenized hybrids  “We are extending the simple tokenized equity and bond models to include more interesting hybrid and structured instruments that would be more useful for our clients and partners,"" Sehra said. ""A natural extension of this is to ensure that the interest is not just simple fixed-rate coupons, but has the flexibility to be a floating value depending on some external reference rate.""  There are really two parts to tokenized securities, Sehra explained. The first is the token register (or the smart contract) that creates the financial instrument on a blockchain like ethereum, and allows for the transfer of tokens from one party to another, in accordance with a KYC/AML whitelisting process.  The second is the events manager. Different securities have different types of events – consider bonds and their coupons, redemptions and defaults, or equities and their voting and dividend rights. However, as instruments become more complex the number of events and information required to manage the events becomes more nuanced and complex, too.  Managing and programming all the complex events into a smart contract is not commercially viable at this time and not well understood from a regulatory perspective for tokenized securities, said Sehra.  “However, some of the tools to manage the key information flows in the events can be standardized and automated,"" he said.  In the case of FRNs, it involves managing the data feeds, making a calculation, generating payment amounts and then executing those payments through a smart contract on a blockchain.  Sehra said:  “Just like the token register model requires whitelisting and accountable end-points to ensure decentralized registers can be used for securities, event management on a blockchain will also require endpoint checks and sign off by trusted parties before capital markets participants will even contemplate using it.""

The score will use a combination of analytics methods in an effort to achieve a fairer picture of the market, according to Bobby Ong, CoinGecko's co-founder.  Specifically, the new method will combine online traffic analysis by SimilarWeb and the median of users' trading volume from 10 exchanges that have trustworthy reported volume as indicated by a report by Bitwise for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which was published in March.  In its report, Bitwise contended that 95 percent of the reported volume on the market is fake, and only 10 exchanges show the real volume of trading on their platforms (among them are Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and others).  ""If an exchange is reporting high total trading volume and therefore ranking as one of the top exchanges by reported trading volume, we would expect that there would be high number of website visitors as well,"" Ong explained. ""However, when we did research on SimilarWeb, many of these exchanges [that show high volumes] actually have very low website visitor count.""  Digging into the data  After calculating the average daily user trading volume for each exchange, CoinGecko will compare it to the median number for the 10 exchanges deemed to be reporting honestly by Bitwise — the ""benchmark.""  If the volume is lower than the benchmark, it means the exchange is reporting the numbers fairly, but if it's higher than the benchmark, CoinGecko will ""normalize their volume downwards by multiplying their daily SimilarWeb traffic estimate against the benchmark,"" Ong said.  CoinGecko will also analyze exchanges' order books measuring the bid/ask spread (the difference between the buy and sell prices) and capital required to move the order book by 2 percent.  ""A thick order book will show that there is more liquidity for any trader to come in and buy/sell without much slippage or without affecting the price too much and is a relatively good indicator of liquidity (for now),"" Ong explained. ""A thin order book will show that there is no liquidity for any trader to trade meaningfully.""  Combining the volume, web traffic and order book analysis, CoinGecko will give each exchange a ""trust score,"" with three color-coded categories: green (good), yellow (fair) and red (poor).  ""With Trust Score, the algorithm prioritizes exchanges with tight spread and deep depth rather than reported trading volume,"" Ong said.

The funds were collected in the form of USDT, the stablecoin operated by the closely-linked firm Tether, according to the tweet.

However he added a correction in the Twitter thread saying that, ""since there is some misunderstanding: Most was raised by investor who contacted directly [Bitfinex's parent company] iFinex and subscribed directly with iFinex.""  Last week, Bitfinex shareholder Dong Zhao announced that the exchange had received $1 billion in hard and soft commitments, adding “there’s a high possibility Bitfinex will not conduct a public sale” of its exchange token, dubbed LEO.  Bitfinex announced the token offering earlier this month, days after the New York Attorney General’s office revealed that it was looking for more information about the exchange’s alleged cover-up of an $850 million loss. The missing funds, which were held by third-party payment processor Crypto Capital, have been seized by several authorities, iFinex has claimed.  In its official white paper for the token sale, released last week, the exchange said any funds recovered will be used to “repurchase and burn” outstanding LEO tokens.  Bitfinex will launch a dedicated platform for projects to raise funds via similar initial exchange offerings next month.

42381906,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3Z9,1557745236,Bitcoin Has Recovered Nearly 25% of Its Bear Market Price Losses,"View  Bitcoin has erased nearly 24 percent of the price losses seen in 12 months to December 2018.  Sunday's high above $7,500 could come into play again if a contracting triangle on the hourly chart ends with a bull breakout.  A UTC close below $6,762 would validate the bull exhaustion signaled on Sunday and allow a deeper correction to $6,000.  Dips to $6,000, if any, could find bids as the longer duration charts are biased bullish.  Despite a pullback from 9-month highs overnight, bitcoin (BTC) has still clawed back nearly a quarter of the losses since the drop from its all-time high in late 2017.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading just below $7,100 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $7,588 on Sunday – a level last seen on Aug. 2, 2018.  With the rally to nine-month highs, BTC erased 23.6 percent of the price slide from the all-time high of $20,000 reached in December 2017 to lows near $3,100 seen in December 2018.  Notably, with the next mining reward halving due in May next year, bitcoin looks likely to continue to recover its losses from the period.  Mining reward halving is aimed at controlling inflation by reducing the rewards per block mined by 50 percent. The process is repeated every four years and tends to put a strong bid under the cryptocurrency almost 1.5 years in advance, according to historical data.  For instance, bitcoin created a long-term bottom 18 months ahead of the reward halving in July 2016 and rallied 178 percent 12 months leading up to the event.  With history possibly looking to repeat itself, the path of least resistance is to the higher side. In the short-run, however, the price may pullback to establish a higher low (new base) before rallying further.  Daily and hourly charts  Bitcoin fell close to 4 percent on Sunday, leaving a red candle with a long upper shadow in its wake – one widely considered a sign of bullish exhaustion.  So far, however, the follow-through to that candle has been anything but bearish with the cryptocurrency finding takers near $6,860 earlier today and moving back above $7,000.  Further, the moving average studies continue to favor upside in prices. For instance, the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs), currently at $6,759 and $6,265, are trending north. The stacking order of the 50-day MA, above the 100-day MA, above the 200-day MA, is a classic bullish indicator.  A retest of highs above $7,500 could soon be seen if the contracting triangle seen on the hourly chart (above right) is breached to the higher side.  However, both the overbought readings on the 14-day relative strength and Sunday’s candle representing bullish exhaustion would gain credence if BTC finds acceptance below $6,762 (yesterday’s low) in the next 48 hours or so.  That could yield a deeper pullback toward the psychological support of $6,000. The probability of a drop to $6,762 would rise if the contracting triangle ends with a downside break.  Weekly chart  Bitcoin ended last week with 22 percent gains – the third biggest weekly gain since December (marked by numbers above). Further, the cryptocurrency closed above the 100-week MA, which may now offer support at $6,562.  Pullbacks to $6,000, if any, following a potential close daily close (UTC) below $6,762, could be short-lived, as the bullish (ascending) 5-week MA is currently located just below $6,050.

42381902,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3U7,1557741632,BitOasis Clears Hurdle in Bid to Launch Regulated Crypto Asset Exchange,"Dubai-based crypto exchange BitOasis is one step closer to launching a regulated custodian and trading platform in United Arab Emirates after receiving an in-principle approval (IPA) from the nation's financial regulator.  The bitcoin startup announced Monday that the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) had granted it the IPA, clearing a regulatory hurdle for the company. It now has to satisfy specific requirements for the IPA in order to receive a license before it can begin offering services.  Still, BitOasis contends that the IPA is still significant, and may help it become the first regulated exchange and custodian for crypto assets in the Middle East.  The exchange, which described itself as ""the largest crypto asset platform and exchange"" in the region already, said it had been working with regulators since 2018, with a particular focus on the UAE, though it has interacted with regulators across the region.  The company said in a press statement:  ""The IPA serves as an important milestone and achievement for the company in its journey as it aims to become the first licensed and regulated crypto asset exchange and custodian in the Middle East, and among a group of few regulated exchanges in the space globally.""  Ola Doudin, BitOasis' co-founder and CEO, said in a statement that the exchange plans to relaunch its platform -- this time as a regulated entity -- over the next year. The startup also plans to add new crypto asset products and try to expand into new markets such as Saudi Arabia.  ""The company will also continue actively working with regulators to accelerate the adoption of crypto assets across the region,"" BitOasis said.  The exchange, which launched in 2015, was the first Middle Eastern crypto platform to raise venture funding, and offers localized services in the region as well as North Africa.

42381908,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3bf,1557741614,Fans Can Now Bet Crypto on Twitch's Top 'Fortnite' Streams,"Fans of the biggest Fortnite and Apex Legends streamers on Twitch can now place real bets on how well they play.  Esports platform Unikrn is debuting a new product that lets fans wager crypto on Twitch and other gaming sites, in a bid to give users more content for gambling.  The problem with running an esports book is that there isn't always something to bet on, according to Unikrn CEO Rahul Sood.  ""Other sports books, the reason they can be successful is that they have thousands of events they can take on at any given time,"" Sood told CoinDesk.  Right now, users can bet on live esports tournaments at the top tier. They can also bet against themselves on Unikrn. But people don't always want to bet on themselves, and while there's a lot of esports tournaments in the world, there are not yet enough for fans to bet on a top-tier game no matter the time.  To get there, Unikrn is announcing a new system that lets visitors to its website open up streams on other platforms and bet on the outcomes of two of the biggest free-to-play first-person-shooter games out there.  To assess the outcome live, the computer actually watches the gameplay with them. It uses computer vision to assess whether the player wins or loses (and to build up its book on the streamer).  ""We showed this tech to a few of the larger casino companies in the world, and their minds were blown,"" Sood said. ""There's a pretty good opportunity for us to expand our business.""  Like a casino, Unikrn doesn't arrange bets between players. Unikrn is always on the other side of every bet placed on the platform.  Founded in 2014, Unikrn has raised $10 million in venture funding, from backers such as Binary Capital, Ashton Kutcher and Mark Cuban. At the end of 2017, the company announced a $40 million public token sale for UnikoinGold, the token now used for placing bets and earning rewards on its platform.  In late 2018, it acquired a license for online wagering from the Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission.  Unikrn currently has roughly 100,000 registered bettors and 4 million visitors per month, according to Sood.  Twitchy gamblers  Online streaming is gigantic, with viewership numbers that rival cable news networks.  Amazon's Twitch alone had 2.7 billion hours watched in the first quarter of 2019, with another 700 million hours watched on competing game streaming platforms, according to StreamLabs.  While Unikrn will only provide gambling on the very best streams, those numbers still give some sense for how enormous the interest is in watching top players game.  ""Unikrn is creating a fully-engaging platform to tap the potential of this unprecedented volume of competition-based entertainment,"" Unikrn COO Andrew Vouris said in a statement. ""Streamers are the star athletes of a new generation, and they’re always on.""  Sood demonstrated the product for CoinDesk. There's a number of different ways a player can bet on a round while a stream is live, such as betting on whether or not the streamer will win it, how long they will survive, how many kills they will get and more. In fact, they can place multiple bets on the same round.  The streams that can be bet on include players that are well understood by Unikrn's computers.  ""We know how good they are. We have created a strong book on them,"" Sood explained.  Just like any other gambling, Sood said, there's no need for his company to get permission from streamers, but he does see a future where some of them will enter into partnerships with Unikrn, which could help spread awareness for the product.  Betting on the past  Unikrn has another new product it's announcing today, and it's one that non-gamblers may have a hard time believing.  The company is also giving users a way to bet on a giant backlog of matches from esports games that have happened in the past. It's kind of like betting on a recording of a football game.  If that sounds crazy, it's not without precedent. As Sood told us, digital horse racing is big throughout the United Kingdom. That is, betting on cartoon horses racing inside computers. It's something gamblers do when there's no real race to bet on.  ""We looked at that model and thought, 'How can we do something like that with esports?'"" Sood said.  Unikrn's answer is past-game betting on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) matches. It calls the new product ""Virtual Betting.""  In each professional game of CS:GO, there are multiple individual matches. So when players get set to bet, they might know the results of the overall game they are watching, but they don't know which match they are seeing.  Even for a wizard of CS:GO history, the system doesn't give players much time. ""This moves very fast. People need to be engaged, need to be watching, to bet on it,"" Sood said, as he showed us a demo.  ""This is like 24 hours a day. It continues to run,"" Sood said.  As to the bets, users can take fairly significant positions based on their history with Unikrn, but no one can place unlimited bets. As the system becomes more familiar with them, it allows them to bet more on any given round.  Legal restraints might slow the rollout of these gaming products in the U.S. because they need a local casino partner in most cases.  In much of the rest of the world, Unikrn's license with the Isle of Man covers their business. ""They gave us approval on both of these,"" Sood said.

42381892,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3HX,1557738058,Crypto Investor Awarded Over $75 Million in SIM-Swapping Hack Case,"U.S.-based cryptocurrency investor and entrepreneur Michael Terpin has won over $75 million in a lawsuit related to a SIM-swapping fraud.  Terpin filed the case against 21-year-old Nicholas Truglia earlier this year, saying the Manhattan resident had defrauded him of cryptocurrencies after gaining control of his cellphone number. California Superior Court has now ordered Truglia to pay Terpin $75.8 million in compensatory and punitive damages, Reuters reported Saturday citing court documents.  Terpin had complained of losing three million unspecified cryptos via the hack in early 2018, which were worth $23.8 million at the time, according to the report.  In a SIM-swap scam, hackers pose as the owners of victims’ mobile phone numbers, convincing telecom providers to grant them access to their calls and messages by issuing a SIM with the same number. In this way, they can gain access to important accounts, such as those held at crypto exchanges.  Terpin also sued telecoms firm AT&T last August, claiming the company had failed to protect his cellphone data. “In recent incidents, law enforcement has even confirmed that AT&T employees profited from working directly with cyber terrorists and thieves in SIM swap frauds,” he contended at the time.  Truglia is also reportedly alleged to have used the SIM-swapping method to steal from a number of individuals. He was arrested in New York last November and faces 21 felony counts related to six victims, the New York Post reported late last year.  SIM-swapping  is becoming an increasingly popular way for criminals to access the cryptocurrency wallets of victims and there have been accusations that mobile providers are not doing enough to protect their customers. Indeed, U.S.-based law firm Silver Miller recently filed arbitration claims against AT&T and T-Mobile on behalf of victims who have been hacked using the method.  In a recent case, the U.S. Department of Justice last week indicted a group of six individuals dubbed “The Community,” alleging that they had stolen cryptocurrencies using SIM-swaps.

42381905,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3Wd,1557734429,Slowly But Surely: May Was a Quietly Big Month for Blockchain,"Don Tapscott is co-founder of the Blockchain Research Institute and co-author of ""Blockchain Revolution"" with Alex Tapscott. Disclosure: He owns Atoms.      Monday begins Blockchain Week in New York centered around CoinDesk's Consensus 2019 conference. My takeaway on the current sentiment? The crypto spring may have begun; but for blockchain in the enterprise, it’s becoming summertime.  Over the month, there has been a flurry of activity – from partnerships and plans to pilots and full-scale deployments – among some of the world’s leading enterprise.  Ten events, in particular, demonstrate just how much innovation we’ve seen during May, a time I think merits the moniker the ""Month of Blockchain.""  Here's why:  1. Central banks are breaking new ground  At the end of 2016, we predicted that a major central bank would test a digital fiat currency in the next year. None did. Though central banks explored the use of blockchain more enthusiastically in the years since not one of them conducted a major pilot.  Then, in late April, the Bank of Canada and the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced their success in completing a digital currency swap using blockchain. While both had been experimenting with domestic payments, this marked the first such endeavor for payments across borders – one small test for the two central banks, and a giant leap for central banking as a whole.  2. FedEx shares strategy for blockchain in logistics  Also in April, we hosted the inaugural Blockchain Revolution Global, a conference focused solely on enterprise blockchain. There were a number of highlights, but among the most exciting was FedEx CIO Rob Carter and FedEx Logistics CEO Richard Smith detailing FedEx’s uniquely collaborative and notably enthusiastic approach toward blockchain in transportation.  “Rather than focusing on competitive advantage, FedEx is focused on how we can leverage our industry leadership to foster innovation and collaboration among our peers,” Carter wrote in a summary of our discussion.  That same day, we hosted the very first panel featuring leaders from the big three — FedEx, DHL and UPS — to discuss the importance of developing standards for blockchain. Carter even went on to call on governments to play a more active role in mandating blockchain and building those industry standards.  3. Pepsi improves digital ad efficiency in a blockchain pilot  In 2017, over $200 billion were spent on digital advertising worldwide, but concerns over wasteful spending have caused some of the world’s largest spenders to scale back. Food and beverage giant PepsiCo made its own leaps in blockchain, focusing on this often-overlooked application of digital marketing. The results of PepsiCo's pilot project incorporating blockchain into its digital advertising demonstrated some remarkable results, with a 28 percent improvement in advertising efficiency.  The pilot used smart contracts to reconcile data from multiple sources in PepsiCo’s advertising supply chain, creating a single version of the truth over an ad’s effectiveness.  This transparency should help to ensure that PepsiCo pays for ads only in environments that are brand safe, visible, and free from ad fraud.  4. Starbucks moves forward with 'bean-to-cup' blockchain  It’s been nearly three years since Walmart and IBM conducted their groundbreaking pilot using blockchain to trace pork and mangoes from farm to fork on Hyperledger. (IBM has subsequently announced it has over 130 production networks in operation.)  By providing a single, secure digital ledger to record information, collecting data on the provenance of these products now takes seconds, not weeks. Since then, hundreds of the world’s largest companies – from aerospace and automakers to diamonds and defense – have begun using blockchain to trace the source and track the custody of their products.  Now, the world’s largest coffee chain is using blockchain to track the source of each cup of coffee. Just last week, Starbucks announced its work with Microsoft’s Azure Blockchain Service to allow customers to trace the journey of their coffee, from one of 380,000 farmers to the barista.  The project, it is hoped, would build more consumer confidence in the sourcing of Starbucks’ coffee, while generating potential financial rewards for farmers down the supply chain.  5. JP Morgan ramps up Quorum blockchain platform  JP Morgan Chase’s revamped its blockchain platform, Quorum, in a big way, after the banking giant announced a new partnership with Microsoft Azure Blockchain.  The partners have quietly remodeled the platform over the past six months to improve security features and make it more accessible to a large array of businesses. With this new partnership, JP Morgan has laid the groundwork for a potential spinoff from the bank.  With 220 banks signed up on JP Morgan’s Interbank Information Network, and massive projects such as energy trading platform Vakt already running on Quorum, this recent announcement has injected new life into the bank’s blockchain project.  6. VW begins using blockchain to source cobalt  The automotive sector has been the focal point of innovation in everything from artificial intelligence and machine learning to the Internet of Things. In April, Europe’s largest auto manufacturer, Volkswagen, announced a first crucial step into the blockchain ecosystem.  Working with IBM, VW will join others like the Ford Motor Company in tracking the source of cobalt using blockchain. Using blockchain, VW and others are hoping to ensure the cobalt used in their car batteries is mined using only ethical labor practices.  7. Facebook ramps up blockchain adoption  The buzz over Facebook’s potential plans with the new technology has been swelling for some time now. In the last month, it has become something of a roar, with reports that the social media giant has been approaching venture capital firms with plans for a new cryptocurrency and mobile payments system.  Facebook itself has remained notoriously quiet about its plans, but a recent report from Bloomberg revealed that the project itself will be a stablecoin – a crypto asset pegged to a certain value.  No doubt, this innovation would have enormous implications not just on the payments industry, but on the entire state of the Internet as we know it!  8. Amazon releases Managed Blockchain service  Not to be outdone by one digital conglomerate entering the blockchain space, Amazon Web Services recently made its Amazon Managed Blockchain generally available. The product essentially allows businesses to connect various AWS accounts as nodes in their own blockchain network, while Amazon oversees the various software and network settings required to manage and maintain the network.  The process for building a blockchain network is currently quite arduous, which has limited a lot of blockchain applications to large enterprise. This new service could have a profound impact on small and medium enterprise looking to leverage blockchain to improve their transaction speed.  9. Microsoft unveils full Azure Blockchain Service  The very same week Amazon released its Managed Blockchain, Microsoft responded by unveiling its full Azure Blockchain Service. The new service enables businesses and developers to create their own permissioned blockchain through the Azure Portal.  Just a few days later, Microsoft went a step further, providing a toolkit for Azure developers to build blockchain applications on the Ethereum blockchain. It also announced partnerships with two of the world’s largest brands, Starbucks and JP Morgan, and so we can expect this service to generate a great deal of buzz.  10. Cosmos launches the 'Internet of Blockchains'  Perhaps the greatest challenges for blockchains in enterprise – particularly public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum – have been the abilities to scale and to transact between different blockchain networks. Amid much fanfare in April, the blockchain platform Cosmos finally launched its native token, ATOM, intended to overcome the scalability and interoperability issues associated with blockchain technology.  The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, gave ATOM a vote of confidence not often seen in crypto, by adding this currency to its exchange without Cosmos’ asking to be listed. Expect Cosmos to be a big topic of discussion at New York Blockchain Week.  This list of activity from some of the world’s largest brands is remarkable, but perhaps more remarkable is that it is far from exhaustive.  Now, with the price of bitcoin back above $6,000 and steadily climbing, we think that the sharp market correction of 2018 did nothing to hamper the overall adoption of blockchain among large enterprises. Quite the opposite, we’ve seen more activity among enterprise in the last month than in the entirety of 2017.  For too long, the crypto tail has been wagging the blockchain dog.  At last, the dog is having its day. Wuff!

42381901,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q3Rb,1557731703,From Crypto Winter to DeFi: A Year of Loss and Opportunity,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, a custom-curated magazine delivered exclusively to Consensus 2019 attendees.      Whatever transpires at this year’s Consensus conference, it’s safe to say it will be nothing like last year’s.  In May 2018, a number of crypto millionaires chose Consensus and New York Blockchain Week to show the fruits they’d taken from a crazy price bubble that ended four months earlier. Though they represented a small minority of attendees, their ostentatious displays of Lamborghinis and decadent all-night boat parties had an outsized influence on how observers perceived the tone of the event.  I for one am relieved that this year’s conference will surely be a more subdued affair.  It means we can discuss protocol developments, new applications, business models and regulatory actions in a setting that lets the mainstream media focus on the topic at hand, without falling for the voyeuristic distractions of a “Housewives of Crypto” show playing in the wings.  In fact, if we use the past two Consensus events as bookends for a 12-month review, we can look back on the past year – dubbed by many as the ""Crypto Winter"" – and satisfyingly conclude that it also included some impressive progress in blockchain evolution.  The post-bubble mantra was “BUIDL, not HODL,” and it seems this call to arms was taken seriously by “builders” in the crypto community. A year that marked the 10-year anniversary of the launch of bitcoin was as exciting as any other in the short but action-packed world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.  Learning from mistakes  This is not to say it wasn’t a tough year.  As bitcoin’s price collapsed from its lofty peak of $19,783 in December 2017 to a low of $3,122 a year later, as ether retracted 94 percent peak-to-tough, and as countless ERC-20 tokens that were issued in the prior two years plunged to near worthlessness, the crypto community came under a barrage of criticism.  Some of it was justified – one research paper suggested that more than two-thirds of initial coin offerings (ICOs) were scams. But at times the mainstream criticism during the downturn was as extreme as the crypto hype had been during the bubble period. The economist Nouriel Roubini made an art form out of his profanity-laced attacks on all things and all people associated with the sector.  Sadly, headlines around both ICOs and poorly managed cryptocurrency exchanges last year often reinforced this all-too-common misconception of the technology and its advocates as farce.  In November, the SEC fined boxer Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled for not disclosing that they’d been paid to promote an ICO by a company called Centra Tech, whose founders were indicted for fraud. Throughout the year, questions were constantly raised about whether Tether, the stablecoin used by numerous exchanges to manage their crypto and fiat floats, was sufficiently backed by reserves to sustain its one-to-one peg to the dollar.  And later in 2018, the collapse of Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX, which lost $190 million of customer funds after its founder, Gerald Cotten, died in India, spawned a cottage industry of conspiracy theories on Twitter and Reddit. But there was a silver lining to these failures. They encouraged developers to devise solutions to them.  Most importantly, one of the industry’s most nagging problems is on the verge of being solved: the risk of relying on third-party custodians to carry out asset exchanges. In 2018, the first decentralized exchanges (DEXs) emerged based on “atomic swap” technology, which uses smart contracts and multi-signature (multisig) technologies to enable seamless, peer-to-peer asset exchanges without any one party having control of both assets at any time. Binance, the new king of crypto exchanges, is now testing a decentralized version of itself.  Meanwhile, Boston startup Arwen announced in January that its technology will enable traders to use regular centralized exchanges to find buyers or sellers for their crypto assets while maintaining full control over their private keys. Similar technologies also underpin the Cosmos project, which launched its system for decentralized, cross-chain exchanges of digital assets in March. Along with alternatives such as Polkadot and Ripple’s Interledger, Cosmos promises deeper pools of liquidity and scalability as it achieves interoperability across different blockchain ecosystems.  And with tokenization innovators seemingly unfazed by the ICO flame out, the past year also saw a flurry of new methods for creating new representations of value to move across these decentralized systems.  Tokens not dead  Consider the surging interest in non-fungible tokens. Unlike, say, a bitcoin or a dollar, which is fungible, or perfectly substitutable for any other bitcoin or dollar, each NFT is unique.  It means that, for the first time, we have a collectible, provably scarce “thing” of digital value. Made popular by the 2017 launch of CryptoKitties – a series of breeding, collectible colorful cats built on the Ethereum ERC-721 standard – NFTs hit their stride last year as businesses such as gaming companies saw opportunities for trading virtual goods online.  MLB Champions, for example, launched a game with Major League Baseball-licensed collectible digital figurines. There were also some innovative uses of NFTs for charity, for rewarding environmental actions and as loyalty points. Later in the year, Cryptokitties founder Dapper Labs tapped $15 million in funding from VCs including Andreessen Horowitz and Venrock.  Then there was another three-letter acronym: STO – security token offering. With the SEC determining that most, if not all, ICOs were unregistered securities, a lot of the fundraising efforts gravitated to STOs. These deliberately self-identified as securities subject to regulatory control, which meant they can’t be sold to the general public without meeting the SEC’s various reporting and other requirements.  STOs don’t make the same revolutionary claims as the ICO boom’s “utility token” purveyors – that their tokens aren’t an investment, but a kind of pre-sold “fuel” that organically regulates a decentralized network. (The SEC wasn’t convinced: it argued that pretty much all ICOs were securities, at least at the moment of sale.) There’s no such fancy “crypto-economics” behind STOs. Nonetheless, they have the capacity to significantly disrupt capital markets.  STOs armed with smart contracts could facilitate automatic, fully reconciled updates of share registries in both primary and secondary markets. They could render traditional book-runners such as underwriters obsolete and allow issuers to fractionalize ownership of the assets to tiny stakes. And they’ve opened people’s minds to the breadth of assets that could be securitized: everything from real-estate and accounts receivable to intellectual property and even rare art.  Lightning  To some crypto enthusiasts, the regulator-friendly STO movement is a let-down from the radical ideas behind ICOs, which promised to disintermediate and democratize venture capital.  But there was plenty going on elsewhere last year to sustain the community’s revolutionaries. Importantly, we saw the serious launch of the Lightning Network, the off-chain payment channel solution to the scaling challenges at bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which many see as the ideal “Layer 2” route to achieving Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of digital cash. A testing version of Lightning formally went live on the bitcoin mainnet in early 2018. Since then the network has grown to encompass around 8,000 nodes and almost 40,000 channels.  To function at scale, this nascent community must grow out a network of interlinking channels – essentially, it must build an economy from scratch. It’s an experimental process, one helped this year by the “Lightning Torch,” a social media-fueled game in which people passed around a small but ever-growing pool of bitcoin via Lightning channels.  Members of the bitcoin breakaway community behind Bitcoin Cash (now itself split into competing forked currencies) mocked Lightning torch carriers for sometimes struggling to find liquid open channels for otherwise small transactions, implying that Bitcoin Cash’s core on-chain feature – bigger blocks – better fulfills “Satoshi’s vision” of peer-to-peer payments than Lightning’s off-chain approach.  It’s too early to know whether Lightning will succeed, but at least this process will let us work with data instead the wild rhetoric that has until now passed for argument between bitcoin’s feuding factions.  Meanwhile, among other altcoins, concerns were raised about 51% attacks. The massive, post-bubble drop in market prices drove miners of many coins to stop using their ASIC rigs. This drove down rental rates for mining equipment, make it comparatively much cheaper to get a majority of the hashing power and engineer a “deep reorg” of old blocks, enabling fraudulent double-spend actions.  The price drop made fraud affordable, which spelled trouble for various proof-of-work blockchains: Bitcoin Gold, Vertcoin, Flo and, the big one, Ethereum Classic.  Again, however, these attacks encouraged positive technological development, in this case to find additional security against double-spends. New approaches included the Komodo Platform’s use of bitcoin’s more reliable security as a backstop to the altcoin’s native consensus security, and a plan proposed by Flo developers to enlist the user base to automatically rent hashing power and offset an attacker. The industry was showing, once again, that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.  Stablecoins and DeFi  The past year was also the year of the stablecoin, where digital tokens are offered by an entity that pegs their value to some other asset, typically dollars. There was a crying need for cryptocurrency exchanges to use an alternative to Tether. But, more importantly, many see trusted stablecoins as the missing piece for enterprise blockchain applications that use fiat-currency mediums of exchange, such as in supply chain management.  These innovations could add a real-time, volatility-free payment rail to systems that until now relied on the friction-filled banking system for settling cash transfers.  Last year, Gemini, Paxos, a venture-backed startup called TrustToken, and a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase all launched stablecoins that back every token issued with a dollar stored in reserves. Each submitted to being heavily regulated and argued that because the funds are stored inside banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, users have peace of mind that their tokens can be redeemed and, by extension, that their one-to-one peg will hold.  Trading in these stablecoins is growing rapidly, but they may face competition from alternatives backed by corporates that leverage giant user bases to create network effects: JP Morgan’s JPM Coin, for example, as well as a widely anticipated offering from Facebook.  For crypto purists who point to persistent crises in the banking system as a reminder of the risks of third-party backers, these reserve systems are all flawed. The alternative, some argue, is for algorithmic stablecoins. This is not easy to achieve, partly because hackers could build competing algorithms to put algorithmic stablecoins’ smart contracts under stress. Nonetheless, a number of complex math solutions are giving it a shot.  One early offering, Basis, disbanded in December as its model, which involved the automatic issuance of interest-earning “bonds” to regulate monetary supply, faced insurmountable regulatory hurdles. But the one that has caught everyone’s attention is Dai, the stablecoin at the heart of MakerDAO, the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency credit project.  MakerDAO is more than a stablecoin project. It’s generating crypto-collateralized loans and has given rise to the fascinating new world of decentralized finance, or #DeFi. Along with the “staking as a service,” in which custodians essentially pay their clients interest on coins that are used to seek block rewards in the validation of proof-of-stake blockchains, #DeFi is giving shape to an unchartered system of new money creation on top of a base cryptocurrency infrastructure. It portends huge potential for frictionless financial access – as well as undeniable risks, with parallels being drawn to systemic crises in traditional finance.  Who knows where it all goes. Either way, it will no doubt provide great fodder for the 2020 Consensus year in review.  Time image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MINING | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.
