42430555,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvX1h,1558556127,Switzerland's SIX Stock Exchange Is Working on a Swiss Franc Stablecoin,"SIX, the Swiss national stock exchange group, is working on creating its own “stablecoin” – a cryptocurrency pegged to the Swiss franc – to facilitate transactions on the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), CoinDesk has learned.  A spokesman for SIX confirmed the move in an email, telling CoinDesk:  “Yes, we are currently working on a CHF Stable Coin – so Swiss franc.”  SIX could not provide any further detail on whether the Swiss franc-backed coins would be for private use within SDX (like JPMorgan Chase's feted JPM Coin) or exist publicly like the universe of stablecoins used to trade crypto on exchanges.  Within SDX, a fiat-backed token could be used to help perform tasks such as atomic swaps of tokenized securities and other assets on the blockchain.  Trailblazer  From the perspective of financial market infrastructures, SIX is clearly emerging as a trailblazer in the crypto space.  In July of last year, SIX said SDX would be in operation in the second half of 2019, starting by tokenizing stocks and bonds and then moving on to explore digital versions of other physical assets like fine art. SDX is also focusing on so-called security token offerings (STOs) with the exchange’s chairman suggesting SIX might even raise some funds itself via an STO.  The crypto innovation being driven by SIX and SDX seems to be exerting a gravitational pull on other digital asset platforms.  Notably, the parent company of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Deutsche Börse, is working with Swiss government-backed Swisscom to test-drive tokenization in Switzerland.  Most recently, Russia’s National Settlement Depository (NSD) announced it would be launching its D3 blockchain and crypto ledger in Switzerland.  Why stablecoins?  In an interview with CoinDesk, Artem Duvanov, head of innovation and a director at NSD, said D3 will be shopping for a suitable stablecoin to add to the platform, mentioning Gemini’s GUSD.  “Stablecoins backed by central bank (preferably) or bank money will drive adoption of D3Ledger and other financial DLT [distributed ledger technology] platforms,"" Duvanov remarked.  ""The reason is very simple – when you have a stable coin INSIDE of the blockchain you can automate more processes and provide more value with smart contracts,"" he continued. ""It is not just about [delivery versus payment], it is also about many corporate actions, for example, dividends distribution.”  Swiss army knifehttps://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/multipurpose-knife-on-dark-background-413682433?src=rSmmGpgTmw4BSWOPHsFLfQ-1-6 image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/22/switzerlands-six-stock-exchange-is-working-on-a-swiss-franc-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20366bf7f5cbb4bfe72b4a25e1aa7b09e7f2a7dd-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Copyright Office does not investigate the truth of any statement made,” the Copyright Office wrote in a press release. “In a case in which a work is registered under a pseudonym, the Copyright Office does not investigate whether there is a provable connection between the claimant and the pseudonymous author.”  As multiple sources have already noted, all it takes to register a copyright is $55 and a stable internet connection. In short, any claim that the U.S. government has registered Wright as the author of bitcoin are spurious at best.  Why did the government go to the trouble of clarifying this point? Wright's actions required it. On Tuesday, a press representative sent a widely read release that suggested, in short, that the government accepted Wright was Satoshi. From the release:  Importantly, the registrations issued by the U.S. Copyright Office recognize Wright as the author – under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto - of both the white paper and code. This is the first government agency recognition of Craig Wright as Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.  The U.S. Copyright Office, on the other hand, doesn't actually recognize anyone for anything. Ultimately, it is a repository designed for protecting the creators of art and literature.

Calling it the ""first law enforcement action of its kind against such a cryptocurrency mixer service,"" Europol said in a statement Wednesday that the seizure of Bestmixer.io followed an investigation that began last summer. As part of the move, police seized six servers based in Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  Coin mixers or ""tumblers"" like Bestmixer.io work by pooling funds together and creating a web of new transactions in an effort to obfuscate their original source. Typically, coin mixer users pay a fee on top of the funds they send in, receiving back their money from a wholly new address.  Europol  alleged that much of the money that passed through Bestmixer.io ""had a criminal origin or destination,"" contending that ""in these cases, the mixer was probably used to conceal and launder criminal flows of money."" The agency said that the service, which launched in May 2018, mixed approximately 27,000 bitcoins.  ""Today's Bestmixer seizure shows an increase in law enforcement activities on pure crypto-to-crypto services,"" said Dave Jevans, CipherTrace CEO. ""This follows on the heels of European AMLD5 regulations and the views expressed by US FinCEN that crypto-to-crypto services are considered to be money services businesses and must comply with those regulations. This is the first public seizure of a bitcoin mixing service, and shows that not only are dark marketplaces subject to criminal enforcement, but other services are as well.""  Europol's statement suggests that the investigation isn't complete and that authorities intend to follow up on the information gleaned from this week's server seizures.  ""The Dutch FIOD has gathered information on all the interactions on this platform in the past year. This includes IP-addresses, transaction details, bitcoin addresses and chat messages,"" the agency said. ""This information will now be analysed by the FIOD in cooperation with Europol and intelligence packages will be shared with other countries.""  ""Bestmixer has blatantly advertised money laundering services, and falsely claimed to be domiciled in Curacao where they claimed it was a legal service. The reality is that they were operating in Europe and services customers from many countries around the world,"" said Jevans.

USDC was launched late last year by crypto finance startup Circle and Coinbase. Earlier this month, Coinbase expanded crypto-to-crypto trading in the stablecoin to 85 countries.  “For new customers in countries like Argentina and Uzbekistan, where consumer prices are expected to inflate by 10–20% in 2020, stablecoins like USDC could provide an opportunity to protect against inflation,"" it said at the time.

42430569,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvXPh,1558533155,Collapsed Cryptopia Founder Wants You to Put Funds on His New Exchange,"Because there are, apparently, second acts in crypto, the creator of the defunct Cryptopia exchange is trying again with a new exchange product called Assetylene.  The exchange, which touts itself as ""New Zealands most advanced crypto trading platform,"" is run by Adam Clark, the former founder and programmer for Cryptopia.  Cryptopia went into liquidation on May 15 after a major hack that drained an estimate $16 million-worth of crypto last year. Most recently the stolen funds are currently moving out of the hacker's wallets and onto various exchanges. One would assume, then, that the founder of a hacked, shuttered exchange, wouldn't try again so quickly.  One would be wrong.  Arguably, Clark hasn't worked on Cryptopia since February 2018, according to LinkedIn, and has been building Assetylene for at least nine months.  The new exchange is clearly just a shell – the About Us page is empty and there is no trading data. As Decrypt notes, the site is running the popular TradeSatoshi exchange software, a turnkey solution that lets you spin up an exchange in a few minutes.  Is Assetylene a real exchange? Will it suffer the same fate as Cryptopia? In finance, past performance is not indicative of future results but in mental health repeating the same thing over and over and expecting a different result is insanity. Perhaps Assetylene falls between the two?

42430572,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvXRh,1558530926,Bitcoin Remains On the Defensive With Price Below $8K,"View  BTC has traded in a narrowing price range over the last 48 hours, aborting the immediate bullish view put forward by Sunday’s double-digit gains.  A range breakdown, if confirmed, would allow a price drop toward $7,200. That looks likely with multiple signs of bullish exhaustion on the daily chart.  The outlook, however, would again turn bullish if the contracting triangle ends with a bullish breakout. In that case, the price could rise to $8,500.  Bitcoin is teasing a downside break of its recent trading range, having again faced rejection above $8,000 earlier today.  The cryptocurrency market leader jumped more than 12 percent on Friday, reviving the case for a potential break above the June 2018 high of $8,500.  The bullish momentum, however, fizzled out on Monday with prices falling from $8,200 to $7,581. Further, BTC remained on the defensive Tuesday, with prices clocking daily highs and lows within Monday’s trading range.  Essentially, BTC's narrowing price range has created a contracting triangle over the last 24 hours, neutralizing the immediate bullish view put forward by Sunday’s rally.  The case for notable price pullback, suggested by repeated bull failures at $8,300 would strengthen if the indecision represented by the contracting triangle ends with a downside break.  As of writing, the lower edge of the trading range is seen at $7,805, while bitcoin is trading at $7,824, down 1.6 percent on the day.  While the short-term prospects are looking a little bleak, the long-term outlook remains constructive, with cryptocurrency reporting nearly 50 percent gains on the opening price of $5,267 seen May 1. Further, BTC is trading well above the 200-day MA, currently at $4,485.  4-hour chart  A 4-hour close below $7,805 would confirm a triangle breakdown and open the door for a drop to $7,200.  Supporting the bearish case is the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, which has turned negative.  Further, the Chaikin money flow index is losing altitude, indicating weakening of buying pressure.  Daily chart  With prices trading well below $8,200, the bearish hammer (or hanging man) candle created on Monday is still valid. That candlestick is widely considered an early warning of a bullish-to-bearish trend change, as discussed yesterday.  Add to that, the three rejections at $8,300 seen in the last eight days, as well as the multiple failures to hold onto gains above $8,000, and the cryptocurrency appears overdue for a correction.  As a result, the narrowing price range looks likely to be breached to the downside.  As mentioned, a range breakdown would open the doors to $7,200. A UTC close below that level would expose the historically strong support of the 30-day moving average (MA), currently at $6,413.

As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, game developers using Epic Games' Unreal Engine will receive better business terms if they deploy their titles on The Abyss. The Abyss, a Steam competitor funded by an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018, rewards game devs for purchases made on the platform.  Mike Gamble, head of games licensing for Epic Games, said in a statement:  “We’re delighted that The Abyss has chosen to provide additional resources to Unreal Engine developers and publishers on its platform. Unreal Engine 4 scales to hundreds of millions of players, and access to premier support and connections with the global community can be critical to success of large-scale games with live operations.”  The precise details of the arrangement are unclear, with both firms citing non-disclosure agreements.  Nevertheless, The Abyss founder Konstantin Boyko-Romanovsky told CoinDesk in an email that conditions between Epic Games and developers will be ""better than standard ones and will not be confined to the premium support.""  Additionally, developers using Unreal will not need to sign a separate agreement with Epic Games. ""All transactions are done through The Abyss,"" he wrote.  Epic offers fairly generous licensing terms to developers using the Unreal Engine. It only requires developers to make a quarterly payment of 5 percent of returns over $3,000, according to its end-user licensing agreement. Developers can also negotiate an upfront price if that's preferable.  The Unreal Engine is a game development platform that first launched in 1998. It has been used to build instances of the ""Mass Effect,"" ""Batman"" and ""Medal of Honor"" franchises, according to Wikipedia.  As part of the new partnership, developers on The Abyss will get access to the Unreal Developers Network. They will also get marketing services from The Abyss.  The Abyss ran an ICO in early 2018 using a model devised by Vitalik Buterin in which token holders could vote on whether the development team should get more funds as the project progressed. The Abyss raised slightly over $15 million, according to Boyko-Romanovsky.  The Abyss launched in March 2019, serving players of massively multiplayer online games. Developers using The Abyss earn income from referrals they make to the platform, even if the people who follow those referrals don't end up purchasing the developer's game.  ""We’re delighted to welcome new Unreal Engine benefits to our platform,” Boyko-Romanovsky said in a statement.  Six games  are currently live on The Abyss, compared to 30,000 on Steam.

42430562,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvXDh,1558527326,Israeli Court Rules Bitcoin Is an Asset in Feud Over Tax Payment,"An Israeli court has ruled that bitcoin is an asset and not a currency, and thus subject to capital gains tax (CGT).  The Central District Court made the ruling in a case involving a blockchain startup founder and the Israel Tax Authority, which ultimately won the decision, Globes reported Tuesday.  The founder, Noam Copel of DAV.Network, reportedly bought bitcoins in 2011 and sold them in 2013 at a profit of 8.27 million Israeli new shekels ($2.29 million). He contended in court that bitcoin should be treated as a foreign currency and not be taxed.  The Tax Authority, on the other hand, argued that bitcoin is not a currency but an asset, and therefore profits should be liable to CGT.  The presiding judge, Shmuel Bornstein, made the point in his arguments that bitcoin as a cryptocurrency could cease to exist and be replaced by another digital currency. Hence, it cannot be considered a currency, especially for tax purposes.  As a result of the ruling, Copel is now liable for tax of around 3 million NIS ($830,600) as well as costs of 30,000 NIS ($8,306), according to the report. However, Copel can yet appeal to the Supreme Court for a reversal of the decision.  With its ruling, the court has sided with the Israeli government’s position that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are considered property for tax purposes. In February 2018, the Tax Authority issued a notice, saying that profits from cryptocurrencies will be subject to CGT at rates from 20–25 percent.  On the other hand, individuals mining or trading cryptocurrencies in connection with businesses, are liable to a 17 percent value-added tax in addition to capital gains tax.

42430543,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvTFh,1558523403,Russia's Central Depository to Launch Security Token Blockchain Next Month,"Russia’s National Settlement Depository (NSD) plans to launch its long-awaited digital asset ledger next month – 5,000 kilometers away from the institution’s Moscow headquarters.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the Moscow Exchange Group subsidiary chose Switzerland as the jurisdiction to incorporate D3ledger (Decentralized Digital Depository), a project that’s been in the works since 2017.  Artem Duvanov, head of innovation and a director at NSD, said it picked Switzerland for its congenial regulatory environment and potential for market-making in digital assets.  He told CoinDesk:  “In terms of laws, [Switzerland] allows the tokenization of at least some kind of securities. That’s the first thing. And it’s favorable for such things because there is market demand.”  At launch in June, D3ledger will track ownership of several assets: a security token representing unregistered shares in a small healthcare company; sora, a cryptocurrency developed by Japanese tech provider Soramitsu; and the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, bitcoin and ether, along with any ERC-20 token that runs on the ethereum blockchain.  In the case of bitcoin and ethererum, however, the assets will be depository notes, akin to the way depository receipts for foreign company stocks are traded on U.S. exchanges.  “When you say you have some bitcoins in our platform,” said Duvanov, “you actually have some depository receipts for bitcoins which are held by D3ledger platform.”  This involves “freezing” bitcoins and ethereum tokens on the public networks using a multi-signature smart contract and then issuing rights to the tokens on the D3ledger network, which was built using Hyperledger Iroha, an implementation contributed to the Hyperledger consortium by Soramitsu.  “The idea behind D3ledger is a combination of the public network and a private network; slow public network and fast private network,” Duvanov said. “This method of holding them is distributed so there is no custody risk like if you store your bitcoins on an exchange.”  According to Duvanov, the next step will be adding a reputable stablecoin to D3ledger to enable over-the-counter (OTC) crypto transactions without counterparty risk and delivery-versus-payment of securities trades, meaning both sides of a trade are completed simultaneously.  “We will include an established connection with some stablecoin, like Gemini coin or some coin backed by dollar or euro,” he said.  The SDX effect  NSD, whose main business is acting as the back office for the Russian stock market, is following in the footsteps of another traditional financial market infrastructure (FMI) provider, Deutsche Börse, which also chose Switzerland to test-drive tokenization.  Notably, the parent of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is working with Swiss government-backed Swisscom, the largest telco and major provider of banking infrastructure. Also included in the “Custodigit” group alongside Deutsche Börse are custody specialist Metaco; Sygnum, a Singapore-based fintech enabler; and Daura, a platform for digitizing Swiss shares of small companies.  Meanwhile, Switzerland's own national stock exchange, SIX, is building its own crypto tokenization and trading shop, SIX Digital (SDX).  In July of last year, SIX said SDX would be in operation in the second half of 2019, starting by tokenizing stocks and bonds and then moving on to explore digital versions of other physical assets like fine art.  SDX is also focusing on so-called security token offerings (STOs) with the exchange's chairman suggesting SIX might even raise some funds itself via an STO.  Switzerland has something of a heritage when it comes to looking after assets in a secure and private manner. Indeed, the storing of cryptographic keys could be viewed as a return to secret numbered bank accounts, as one crypto custody provider quipped.  Not only are the declarations being made by SIX attracting other platform providers, but they may also be driving change in Swiss law, Duvanov suggested:  “There are some proposals for a new law which I think are driven by the SIX project. I am pretty sure because I see proposed changes which are meeting the requirements of SDX. I think the SDX project will drive changes in Swiss law and so everybody will follow.”  A spokesman for SIX said that the exchange “is in close contact with the relevant regulators. So I would not call it ‘driving changes in the law’ but rather being the sparring partner in order to help address issues/questions/challenges that must be considered and represented in a potential law.”  As such, it was “not an unexpected development” that others were coming to Switzerland to explore digital assets in a regulated manner, said the SIX spokesman. “The fact that more and more infrastructure providers are moving into this area confirms that we are on the right track.”  Moscow Exchange image via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/22/russias-central-depository-to-launch-security-token-blockchain-next-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d5f083fbf2d852947ed78f18cc03fee7bcc7134-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430530,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvSth,1558519222,Crypto Lending Startup BlockFi Slashing Interest Rates on Ether Deposits,"Cryptocurrency lending startup BlockFi is almost halving the interest rates it offers on ether (ETH) deposits, while some bitcoin (BTC) rates will increase slightly.  From June 1, customers with 25–100 ETH balances in a BlockFi Interest Account (BIA) will see the interest rate drop from the current 6.2 percent annual percentage yield (APY) to 3.25 percent, the startup announced Tuesday. Those holding over 100 ETH balances will earn just 0.2 percent APY.  Some BTC balances, on the other hand, will see a slight interest rate increase – up to 2.15 percent from the current 2 percent – for deposits of over 25 BTC. Those holding 0.5–25 BTC will continue to earn 6.2 percent APY, BlockFi said.  The firm cited the reason for the increased interest rate on larger BTC deposits as being because borrowing and lending markets for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization “have developed into a vibrant and growing field.”  On the contrary, the ether lending market has become ""stagnant"" over the last couple quarters, BlockFi said. The firm's terms and conditions state that it can change interest rates at its discretion.  The company launched the BIA in March, offering an annual interest rate of 6 percent, paid on a monthly basis in cryptocurrency. That monthly interest is then compounded to produce a 6.2 percent APY.  BIA crypto holdings are custodied at the Gemini Trust Company, which is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services and also offers insurance coverage for the digital assets it holds in custody.  In Tuesday’s update, BlockFi further updated that the BIA now has over $100 million in assets under management – almost double the $53 million it had as of last month.  BlockFi is backed by notable investors including Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Ventures and Anthony Pompliano’s Morgan Creek Digital. The firm raised $4 million last December, and previously raised $52.5 million last July.

42430547,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvTJh,1558515605,Firefox Browser Adds Option to Automatically Block Crypto Mining Scripts,"Mozilla has released an update for its Firefox browser which includes an option to block cryptocurrency mining scripts on websites.  The option is being offered alongside control of cookies and trackers in the “Privacy & Security” tab of the browser, where users can now also choose to tick a box that prevents “cryptominers” from running, Mozilla announced on its blog Tuesday.  Crypto-mining scripts on websites run in the browser, normally without users’ knowledge or consent, using the power of the computer processor to mine cryptocurrency for hackers’ personal gain.  “These scripts slow down your computer, drain your battery and rack up your electric bill,” Mozilla said.  The option to block mining scripts has been available in beta since the feature's initial launch in April, with Mozilla partnering with cybersecurity firm Disconnect for the service.  Mozilla revealed its plan to offer the feature last August, saying its goal was to prevent third-party scripts from hampering the user experience. Web browser Opera also offers miner protection in its smartphone version, while Google's Chrome has banned miners from its extensions.  Illicit crypto mining, sometimes called crypto-jacking, is fast gaining in popularity with criminals (there are more legitimate uses too). The code that carries out the task of mining can be propagated by malware and placed directly within computer systems, or it can be placed on websites by hackers to mine using victims' machines through browsers.  A report from Skybox Security last year found that the method now account for 32 percent of all cyberattacks, while ransomware only makes up 8 percent.  In 2017, Skybox found that the situation was almost exactly reversed. While ransomware attacks – in which the data on an individual’s computer is encrypted by malware and only unlocked upon payment of a fee – made up 32 percent of all attacks, cryptojacking represented 7 percent of the total at the time.

42430539,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvT7h,1558512352,Traders Accused of Illegally Collecting $56 Million in Bitcoin for Loan Scheme,"Two over-the-counter (OTC) market makers in China have been accused of illegally collecting bitcoin now worth $56 million from more than 100 OTC traders as part of a loan scheme.  According to a report from state-owned newspaper BJNews on Wednesday, a group of 20 OTC traders in China filed a complaint to police in the city of Hangzhou in mid April, alleging that the two individuals, Yi Zhou and Xiang Li, had lured traders with the promise of interest on their bitcoin deposits.  Based on the report, Li and Zhou operated chat groups on messaging app WeChat used by OTC traders to post bid and ask prices for various cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, which is usually referred as ""pancake"" to avoid censorship and monitoring by government agencies.  OTC trading remains the primary fiat currency gateway for crypto traders in China after the country's central bank issued a ban on initial coin offerings and fiat-to-crypto spot trading exchanges in September 2017.  The two reportedly built up their credibility after operating an OTC chat group over the last two years, leading to other OTC traders believing the two would be able to pay interest on their deposits of bitcoin.  However, since early April, investors said they started noticing delays in their interest payouts (made in Chinese yuan) while Li and Zhou made excuses, claiming unexpected situations had led to the hold ups.  Some investors even went as far as accusing the two of fraud since they continued raising deposits from investors even when they knew they wouldn't be able to pay back interest, the report added.  The Hangzhou police told BJNews it has established a criminal case against Li and Zhou, who are now being held in custody.  Legal implication  The case highlights the somewhat gray area of OTC trading and financial loans based on cryptocurrencies.  For instance, Sa Xiao, a partner at multinational law firm Dentons' Beijing office, thinks a line should be drawn between individual traders and those that fulfill orders to make profits on a spread (the difference between the bid and ask prices).  Xiao told the newspaper that ""occasional transactions between individuals should be legal,"" since they are exchanging ownership of personal property.  However, she said it could be a criminal offence if anyone uses bitcoin as a financial product to operate a business that makes profits from a spread, but causes consequential losses for customers.  ""Specifically, it could be violating the Article 225 of the Criminal Law,"" she said, which protects against ""illegal acts in business operation and thus disrupts market order.""  Kai Xu, a legal practitioner at the Chinese law firm Deheng, also weighed in on the definition of ""illegally collecting funds from the public."" He said in the report that the OTC traders' intention is an important detail when defining the nature of the act of collecting the claimed crypto loans.  If Li and Zhou solicited the bitcoin loans from non-eligible investors, but did not raise the fund to make off with the money, then it is an illegal collection of public funds, he explained.  ""But if they started with the purpose to possess investors' funds, then it falls under the nature of fraud,"" he said.  Crypto loans have been drawing attention in the past a few months as major crypto firms in China are capitalizing on investors who do not wish to liquidate their assets in a bearish market. CoinDesk reported in April that several firms had originated a combined $60 million worth of loans over the prior five months.  However, for such loans, collateral is required at a rate of at least 60 percent in order to protect investors in case of default.

42430542,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMvTDh,1558495578,$71 Million: Galaxy Digital Sells Stake in EOS Blockchain Maker Block.One,"Galaxy Digital, the crypto merchant bank founded by former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, has received $71.2 million after selling its shares in Block.one, the maker of the EOS blockchain.  Galaxy Digital said in an announcement on May 21 that it closed the transaction on Monday after a tender offer for its position in Block.one was made on April 18. The firm claims it made a 123 percent return on the realized investment and following the transaction, its remaining shares in Block.one ""will no longer maintain a material investment position.""  ""The acceptance of Block.one's tender offer reflected a decision to rebalance the portfolio to maintain an appropriate level of diversification after the position increased due to its substantial outperformance relative to the remainder of the portfolio,"" Novogratz said in the release.  Galaxy Digital added it will still partner with Block.one on other businesses such as the Galaxy EOS VC Fund, which primarily backs startups that are developing applications on the EOS blockchain network. Galaxy Digital and Block.one entered a joint venture in January 2018 to launch the EOSIO Ecosystem Fund with $325 million.  In July of last year, Block.one received investment from a number of big-name investors such as PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu.  Galaxy Digital's exit comes as part of Block.one's buyback program of 10 percent of its company shares.  According to a report from Bloomberg on Wednesday, Block.one's buyback offer values itself at around $2.3 billion, up nearly 66 times from what it was valued at in a 2017 seed funding round. The repurchase price for the buyback is around $1,500 per share. It was offered at $22.5 per share during the 2017 round.  The report added that Block.one had about $3 billion in assets including cash and investments at the end of February, based on a March 19 email Block.one sent to shareholders and seen by the news outlet. Block.one is also holding as many as 140,000 bitcoin, the report further said.
