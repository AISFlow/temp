Merten pointed out that price analysis really isn&apos;t the reason that the number 2 cryptocurrency is set to explode, but what the market dominance shows that actually shows this. This shows through when the cryptocurrency market dominance is measured. Merten believes that current market trends are very similar to what was done in the market back in 2017. Going back to when the last bull market had started in 2017. Before fizzling out and turning into a full-blown bear market by the time the middle of the year 2018 rolled around.

The longtime hot dog maker has put a limited-edition pack of “Hot Doge Wieners” that “comes with the cash value of…20,000 Dogecoins” for sale on eBay. The company said in a tweet that it was only making one package of the special wieners.

On Thursday, however, the auction was resumed and the cash value that comes with it doubled to the equivalent of 20,000 dogecoins, or roughly $4,000 at current prices.

42434954,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyQ8snh,1628113278,Why Web 3.0 Tokens Might Be the Next Hot Trade in Cryptocurrencies,"With bitcoin prices stuck in a months-long holding pattern, some cryptocurrency traders are speculating on what might be the next hot market bet: digital assets associated with visions of a decentralized Internet, referred to colloquially as Web 3.0 tokens.      Data tracked by Messari and published by Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman shows the cryptocurrency sub-sector of ""Web 3.0 tokens"" gained 22% in the week ended Aug. 1, outshining bitcoin and every other sub-sector, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, rallied 10%.      On a year-to-date basis, tokens associated with decentralized Internet applications have seen an average 244% rise, trailing the NFT sub-sector's 2,726% gain but beating bitcoin's 37% appreciation.      Some of the most prominent Web 3.0 coins, such as livepeer (LPT), helium (HNT), and bittorrent (BTT), are up at least 800% this year, despite a slump in cryptocurrency markets since April, according to Messari.      ""Seeing the Web 3.0 ecosystem grow exponentially since the beginning of the year and keep the majority of their gains after the capitulation even in May is very positive for the crypto market,"" Nick Mancini, a research analyst for Trade The Chain, told CoinDesk. ""Higher prices are directly linked to increased demand and expansion of services in each layer, and because of this, the ecosystem is able to continue its growth.""      Web 3.0 refers to a paradigm shift for the Internet run by network participants worldwide and defined by a set of open, trust-minimized and decentralized networks and protocols offering services such as computing, storage, bandwidth, finance and identity.      For instance, the Ethereum-based Livepeer protocol offers a marketplace for video infrastructure providers and streaming applications, while Filecoin and The Graph provide decentralized file storage and data management networks. Helium uses blockchains and tokens to incentivize consumers and small businesses to provide and validate wireless coverage and transfer device data over the network.      Messari's tracker shows the Web 3.0 tokens sub-sector, which includes over 40 coins, has a total market valuation of $25 billion, excluding oracle provider Chainlink. (The oracle provider is widely associated with decentralized finance and has a market cap of $10 billion).      However, just considering prominent projects like The Graph, Filecoin, Helium and Livepeer, the market capitalization of Web 3.0 tokens tallies less than $15 billion. That's just 2% of bitcoin's total market capitalization of $735 billion. But it's similar to the size of the decentralized finance (DeFi) space a year ago. Messari data shows the DeFi subsector now includes 137 assets and is worth over $50 billion.    Awaiting Mainstream Attention    While the Web 3.0 tokens have outperformed bitcoin and other major coins by a big margin this year, the sector is yet to witness the euphoria or mainstream attention that Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi, NFT, and even Ethereum layer 2 projects have received since October 2020.      That’s probably because the underlying technology is relatively complex.      “Web 3 is not quite as easy as DeFi is to understand, and it's probably 12 months behind DeFi in terms of mainstream awareness,” Kyle Samani, co-founder and managing partner at Multicoin Capital, said. “We expect this to change as consumer-facing applications based on NFTs, social tokens and creator monetization grow over the next 12 months such as Audius, Mirror, and many others.”      The DeFi boom began a year ago and has remained intact to date. That sector's market cap has grown from roughly $5 billion in early 2020 to over $50 billion at press time.      Samani is confident that Web 3.0 tokens will play catch up as DeFi sometimes gets a bad rep; however, there is no negativity associated yet with the idea of a decentralized internet. Recently, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Dan Berkovitz said that DeFi derivatives might be illegal in the U.S.      ""No one really says that The Graph, an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and Solana and IPFS, is bad, whereas a lot of people in the existing financial system say that DeFi is bad,” Samani said. ""So as the awareness of Web 3 grows, it's hard to see anything but general support and enthusiasm.""    Institutions Chip In    While mainstream adoption is still at least a year away, deep-pocketed investors are pouring money into Web 3.0 tokens. Multicoin Capital is invested in The Graph, Helium, and Livepeer, according to the official website.      Grayscale, the world's largest digital assets manager and preferred venue for institutional investors to gain exposure to digital assets, launched a livepeer trust in March. Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, director of investor relations at Grayscale Investments, told CoinDesk last month that investors are diversifying into Web 3.0 tokens.      ""It's diversification within the asset class, whether investors want exposure to bitcoin as a store of value, Ethereum for smart contracts,"" Sharif-Askary said.      ""And then the other applications beyond that are building upon those networks, and solving other real-world problems,"" she said, adding that Grayscale's Livepeer trust is structurally identical to the landmark Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, an investment holding company that is also the parent of CoinDesk.)      Livepeer's LPT token is up 1,050% this year. The protocol's weekly revenue surged 10-fold to over $10,000 in the February-to-June period, according to data provided by Web3Index.      Doug Petkanics, CEO and co-founder at Livepeer, told CoinDesk that online streaming is a $70 billion market and accounts for 80% of the Internet traffic today. Further, the market is set to grow from $70 billion to $250 billion in the next five years, according to analysts' projections, Petkanics said. The prospects for The Graph, and Ocean Protocol are also looking bright, as Messari’s second quarter review said.      Aside from the strong use case, many of these Web 3.0 tokens offer attractive yields via Staked, a platform that allows investors to earn yield from staking and DeFi without taking custody of their crypto assets.      For instance, Helium's HNT token currently offers an annualized 8.7% nominal yield, while The Graph's GRT offers a 15% yield and LPT offers 30% returns. The high returns led to positive sentiment for these tokens, as reflected in the below sentiment chart.      ""Traders have been feeling bullish in regard to them, which fuels a network effect,"" Mancini said. ""Traders profit and stake, and, in turn, tell others about the outsized opportunity.""    Crypto Market Is Much More Than Bitcoin    The days of investors considering crypto markets synonymous with bitcoin are passé. While bitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency by market value, the recent underperformance relative to other coins suggests investors are diving deeper into digital-asset markets to find investments with faster growth potential.      ""One-week data may not mean much, but if we look over three months, six months, and 12 months, there's a clear shift away from bitcoin into other sub-sectors, Web 3.0 being one of them,"" Arca’s Jeff Dorman said in a Telegram call.      Per Arca's research note published earlier this week, bitcoin has had ""both poor up-capture and poor down-capture"" this year. In plain English, bitcoin struggled to outperform other major coins during the market-wide downturn observed after mid-April but also underwhelmed as the market recovered in the past couple of weeks.      According to Dorman, the data shows that some new investors are bypassing bitcoin and ether and going directly into other industry sub-sectors. Historically, investors have used the top two coins as gateways.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/04/why-web-30-tokens-might-be-the-next-hot-trade-in-cryptocurrencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36ae8c3cccc4b03301f0f37bf16a5adf4a52a01e-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BlockTower Capital, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research led the round by purchasing TRU, TrueFi’s native token, according to a company statement. TrustToken said it would use the proceeds to expand its team and TrueFi's operations      “We're looking to use this funding both to help us scale the protocol, size of that existing market, but also help us to branch into new markets,” TrustToken’s co-founder and CEO, Rafael Cosman, told CoinDesk.      The round shows investors’ growing interest in DeFi. But while most of the loans in this market are secured with cryptocurrency pledged by borrowers, TrueFi lending does not require collateral.      In lieu of pledged assets, TrueFi bases lending decisions on credit scores derived from on-chain and off-chain data. Since November 2020, the protocol has originated over $200 million in loans and paid out $1.7 million to lenders, without any defaults, according to the company.      With most DeFi protocols focusing on overcollateralized lending, “it's never going to be able to grow to the scale where it can actually take a significant bite out of traditional financing. So a key part of this is actually being able to bring more off-chain data on-chain,” Cosman said.      The round also comes as crypto lending, decentralized and otherwise, is very much on regulators' radar. In recent weeks, centralized platform BlockFi, which offers interest-bearing accounts collateralized by cryptocurrencies, has drawn the ire of five state regulators.      Celsius, which raised about $20 million last year, has long claimed to demand collateral, though it may quietly have made a few uncollateralized loans.      TrueFi’s on-chain credit scores will be beneficial “for lenders to assess where they want to put their capital,” said Blake Richardson, an investor at BlockTower.",POSITIVE,TUSD,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | RESEARCH | TUSD,Frances Yue,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/04/a16z-blocktower-alameda-back-125m-round-for-trusttoken,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42434962,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyQ8sph,1628108617,Market Wrap: Bitcoin and Ether Rise on Bullish Sentiment,"Bitcoin bounced back toward $39,000 on Wednesday as buyers responded to short-term oversold conditions. The cryptocurrency is up about 4% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 9% rise in ether during the same period.      “If BTC holds above $40K for a week, the probability of a breakout would increase,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “We believe, on a conclusive breakout of $40K level, BTC could challenge the $48K level. On the downside, traders will keenly monitor the $36K level.”    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $39845.8, +4.44%  Ether (ETH) $2699.8, +8.6%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4402.7, -0.46%  Gold: $1814.2, +0.21%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.16%, compared with 1.181% on Tuesday.    A bitcoin breakout could encourage ether buying, as well. If support holds, ether could rally further and test the $3,000 mark, according to Balani.      “ETH can outperform BTC in the medium- to long-term, but for the next few quarters, ETH should continue to exhibit strong correlation with BTC,” Balani wrote.      Some analysts, however, expect the recent bitcoin bounce to fade.      “Today’s near-term recovery snapping a four-day losing streak can be interpreted as just a rebound with resistance around $42K to $45K,” DailyFX analyst Michael Boutros wrote.      Additionally, a rebound in the U.S. dollar could limit bitcoin’s advance in the near-term, according to Boutros.    Bitcoin active supply    Roughly 33% of the total bitcoin supply was moved on the blockchain over the past six months, according to data from Glassnode. The chart below shows the percent of active bitcoin supply, which could be a potential indicator of holders' mentality.      Bitcoin active supply is the number of coins transacted at least once over a given period of time. The supply metric declined from a recent peak in April, which coincided with a top in bitcoin’s price of around $63,000. Lower active supply suggests investors are holding their coins, which further reduces the total supply available to be sold.    Declining correlations    Bitcoin’s 90-day correlation with gold turned negative for the first time since November 2017. The cryptocurrency is up about 34% year to date, compared with a 4% loss in gold during the same period. The negative correlation underscores the potential diversification benefits of holding bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio, albeit with greater volatility.      Stocks have also decoupled from bitcoin over the past year. The S&P 500 is less correlated with bitcoin since the March 2020 pandemic shock caused a sell-off across ""risk"" assets, including cryptocurrencies.    AAVE and UNI's decline in exchange reserves    The exchange reserves of many altcoins such as COMP, UMA, SNX and MKR have been increasing since June, noted @kryptonitetrading on CryptoQuant. However, the exchange reserves of AAVE and UNI have been declining, which may indicate that “healthy accumulation has been occurring during this bearish phase in the market,” according to @kryptonitetrading. As the tokens move off exchanges into wallets, it shows investor preference to hold rather than sell.    Altcoin roundup  Ether’s London Hard Fork: As the crypto community awaits the supposedly bullish London hard fork on the Ethereum blockchain, some analysts are taking a cautious stance on ether and foresee little price reaction after the upgrade. “I don’t expect much action in any direction,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole. “The upgrade itself is overrated, and what matters is what happens after.” Ether is the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain, which is scheduled to undergo a hard fork, or backward-incompatible upgrade, called “London,” on Thursday. Once the upgrade takes effect, it is expected to bring a deflationary asset appeal to ether, possibly drawing more investment demand for the cryptocurrency.  Kitco to Issue Gold-Backed Stablecoin: Kitco, a Canada-based provider of news and data on gold and other precious metals, is getting into the stablecoin game. Kitco Gold (KGLD) will be fully backed by physical gold held in Kitco’s DirectReserve vaults and will track the real-time market value of the yellow metal, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports.  New CoinDesk 20 List - MATIC Is In: MATIC, the native currency of the Polygon layer-2 network built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, has been added to CoinDesk 20, which ranks the most heavily traded assets in crypto, as measured by dollar volume on trusted exchanges. Beyond the addition of MATIC, dogecoin and ethereum classic have returned to the ranks of the CoinDesk 20 after being outperformed last quarter by a slew of decentralized finance (DeFi) assets. The three assets that were removed from the CoinDesk 20 in the third quarter were yearn.finance (YFI), nucypher (NU) and XTZ.

42434943,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyQ8sPh,1628107069,Uruguayan Lawmaker Proposes Bill to Allow Crypto to be Used for Payments,"CORRECTION (Aug. 5, 2021, 19:30 UTC): An earlier version of this article said Sartori's bill would treat crypto as legal tender. The lawmaker later said it would only allow businesses to accept crypto as payments for legal transactions, clarifies that the bill would allow for crypto payments between two parties.      A senator from Uruguay has introduced a bill to allow the use of cryptocurrencies as payments in contracts and would regulate their use within the South American country.      The bill, which was presented on Tuesday by Sen. Juan Sartori, seeks to provide ""legal, financial and fiscal security in the business derived from the production and commercialization"" of cryptocurrencies.      ""Crypto assets will be recognized and accepted by law and applicable in any legal transaction. They will be considered a valid means of payment, in addition to those included in the financial inclusion law, as long as they comply with the rules set forth in the law and the regulations,"" the bill said.      Sartori’s bill would establish that cryptocurrencies ""are products of free sale by those entities and individuals who wish to commercialize them,"" and states that any natural or legal person ""may receive and/or send funds in legal tender from and to their own bank accounts or those of licensed companies.""      However, the bill stops short of actually treating cryptocurrencies as legal tender, he told CoinDesk.      If the bill becomes law, the government would issue a “first license” that would enable companies to trade crypto assets on exchanges. A second license would allow ""storing, holding or safekeeping crypto assets,"" while a third would be used to issue crypto assets or utility tokens with “financial characteristics.""      According to the bill, Uruguay’s executive branch would grant the licenses to entities that are in compliance with anti-money laundering secretariat (Senaclaft) and the Central Bank of Uruguay. For other transactions, the ""use of all these instruments will be free and will not require prior consent, permits or licenses.""      Sartori's bill also stipulates the regulation of crypto mining. Miners wouldn’t need a special license like a doctor, but would need permits from Uruguay’s Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining in order to operate.      The measure also includes the ""promotion of technical training for electrical, civil and computer engineers in the generation of virtual assets.""      According to the bill, Senaclaft ""will keep a registry of virtual asset service providers"" and of those individuals or legal entities that wish to carry out activities of generation and commercialization of virtual assets.      Sartori belongs to the ruling National Party. He ran for the National Party’s nomination for president in 2019.      In the Senate, the National Party and its allies, which form a coalition named Coalición Multicolor, hold the majority, with 17 of the 30 seats.      To date only one country has adopted bitcoin as legal tender: El Salvador, which approved a bill earlier this year.

The NFTs will be available for in-game purchase via the Blankos Block Party marketplace on August 11.  The brand said it is hoping to unlock value for the gaming community by encouraging players to interact with its brand in an environment that celebrates art and design.  Most recently, Dolce & Gabbana announced via twitter it had partnered with the luxury marketplace UNXD to launch NFT wearables.  In July, 4K, a novel marketplace that issues NFTs paired with luxury items held in storage, raised $3 million in a seed round of funding that was led by Electric Capital, ConsenSys and IDEO CoLab Ventures.

42434945,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyQ8sXh,1628099739,Gary Gensler Speaks. The Reviews From Crypto Aren't Terrible,"SEC head Gary Gensler signaled Tuesday that the agency would aggressively regulate cryptocurrency markets using existing rules. That sounds scary, but markets have barely blinked – Bitcoin even ticked up slightly this morning. Responses from some industry leaders and analysts were accepting, and even positive.      That’s surprising in an industry used to fending off harmful regulation, and more than anything reflects faith in Gensler’s deep knowledge of both the promise and technical underpinnings of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Gensler affirmed on CNBC this morning that he is “pro innovation,” and broadly, it seems a lot of crypto types actually believe him.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Gensler’s comments were delivered at the Aspen Security Forum yesterday. The prepared statement can be read in full here.      Among other points, Gensler reiterated the enduring importance of the Howey Test: If a financial instrument promises returns from the efforts of others, it’s a security and can be regulated by the SEC. “I believe we have a crypto market now where many tokens may be unregistered securities,” Gensler said. This was most pointedly a reference to Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs, a fundraising process in which founders sell tokens to investors before building a system. They have been rife with fraud as unethical operators stand up fake or deceptive “projects” and sell tokens for them.      File that one under “Dog Bites Man” – there have been dozens of prosecutions of individual token issuers on those exact grounds. And while there are still plenty of operators clinging to the idea that “decentralization” makes it okay to issue unregulated securities, their numbers have dwindled.      The takeaway for some was that Gensler would continue focusing on deceptive “shitcoins”, a likely net positive for the industry. One of the more surprising expressions of approval came from Bruce Fenton, founder of the strongly libertarian Satoshi Roundtable, who wrote this morning that “we need securities markets to work right and help capital formation & building businesses and jobs.”      That sort of openness speaks volumes about the unique degree of respect Gensler enjoys from crypto leaders, thanks to his performance as head of the CFTC following the Financial Crisis and his three years as a professor at MIT, where he taught classes on blockchain topics. Crypto consultant Jeff Bandman summed up the consensus when he wrote of Gensler in January that “he gets it. He has clearly devoted himself immersively to understanding the space on many levels.” It’s unclear, though, whether Gensler can shift the SEC’s slow-moving whack-a-mole approach on ICOs towards something more systematic and consistent.      Michael Saylor, CEO of software firm/bitcoin holding entity MicroStrategy, declared that “Regulatory clarity will benefit #Bitcoin.” That’s certainly talking his own book, but Saylor has a leg to stand on: Bitcoin, thanks to its absent creator and its basically fair launch, has the single best claim in crypto to avoid classification as a security.      Gensler himself appeared to draw a moat around Bitcoin in the remarks, saying that after his time researching cryptocurrency at MIT, “I came to believe that, though there was a lot of hype masquerading as reality in the crypto field, [Satoshi] Nakamoto’s innovation is real. Further, it has been and could continue to be a catalyst for change in the fields of finance and money.”      On CNBC today, Gensler even went so far as to retell Bitcoin’s origin story and conclude “that part of it is okay” – strongly signalling he does not consider bitcoin a security. Gensler has also laid out a pathway to a long-dreamed-of Bitcoin ETF.    Read more: SEC Chairman Gensler Agrees With Predecessor: ‘Every ICO Is a Security’    There was plenty to set other segments of the industry on edge, though. Gensler said that “stablecoins may also be securities,” a claim critics have questioned in part because it’s hard to see how a coin explicitly intended to not change in price can entail the expectation of profit.      Gensler also signaled real headwinds for exchanges like Coinbase: Many are not licensed as securities brokers, but Gensler seems to think they should be. “The probability is quite remote that, with 50 or 100 tokens, any given [crypto exchange] platform has zero securities,” he said.      Love it or hate it, the consensus is that Gensler’s speech has broad implications. Nic Carter, a CoinDesk columnist, described it as “catalytic” and “a significant show of intent” for the SEC.      Coming from another regulator, that could have meant panic. Take for comparison the crypto-taxation fiasco still working its way towards resolution in the U.S. legislature. A few lines of poorly crafted language threatened to completely disrupt the sector by imposing technologically impossible reporting requirements, and lobbyists had to spring into action to try and push things in the right direction. A lot is riding on the belief that Gensler is smart enough to avoid similar destructive screwups.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,David Z.

42434953,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyQ8sjh,1628099715,Chinese Crypto Traders Remain Confident in Binance Despite Regulatory Woes,"Perhaps reflecting how Binance’s Chinese name “币安” means “safe coins,” many Binance users in China said they aren’t too worried about their funds amid the worsening global crackdown on the world’s biggest crypto exchange by volume.      On the surface, this may seem counter-intuitive. Binance is clearly in the crosshairs of regulators from around the world, having been banned in several countries and facing criminal charges in another. Meanwhile, a recent series of regulatory actions by China against crypto activity has rocked the industry overall and contributed to a plunge in crypto prices.  For Chinese traders, though, Binance is largely viewed as immune to China’s actions, which they see as the biggest threat to exchanges with operations in the country. That’s particularly true given how the nation’s regulators recently brought a company as powerful as Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba to its knees so quickly and harshly.      Binance is considered as relatively safe from this type of action due to the company’s decision to move its operations – and the funds it holds – out of the country back in 2017. This distance from Chinese regulators, combined with trading products available only on Binance, is causing traders to look past the exchange’s issues in other regions and prefer it to rivals with operations or executives still in China.      “People are scared of the relentlessness [of the Chinese regulators],” Alex Zuo, vice president of Singapore-based crypto wallet service Cobo, said, referring to an incident involving crypto exchange OKEx last year when it abruptly suspended all account withdrawals for five weeks. “At least Binance’s platform itself has few safety risks.”      OKEx, with deep ties in China, suspended all withdrawal services after a holder of a private key to authorize withdrawals was cooperating with public security investigators in China. Over at rival exchange Huobi, at least one of its key executives allegedly went missing in China due to an investigation related to the exchange’s over-the-counter (OTC) trading service.      As a result, many Chinese users from OKEx and Huobi, two of the most popular crypto exchanges in China, flocked to Binance, as CoinDesk reported previously.      As sources familiar with the matter told CoinDesk, Binance left China completely when China issued a ban in September 2017 on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and centralized fiat-to-crypto trading. But Huobi and OKEx maintained employees and some operations in China for their significant user bases in the country.      “People mostly care about the safety of their funds,” said Lingxiao Yang, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto hedge fund Trade Terminal. “Most of the staffers of Huobi and OKEx are still in China, especially their executives. Once they are under the control (of the Chinese regulators), there’s no guarantee of the safety of users’ funds.”    Binance’s significance to China    For now, Binance’s clean break with China ended up being a smart move, ironically, for its business in China, one of the most active crypto communities and user bases in the world.      Meanwhile, Binance, with its roots in China, provides one of the best and most comfortable user experiences for Chinese traders and investors, whether it is the exchange’s Chinese-language platform or its Chinese customer service, according to industry experts.      “Binance is still the best option for traders” in China, said Rachel Lin, CEO of decentralized derivatives exchange SynFutures. “They are more worried about using Huobi and OKEx.”      Lin added that as the biggest crypto exchange by bitcoin futures open interest, the level of market depth offered by Binance’s USDT-margined futures products is hard to compete with.      A source from a China-based crypto fund, who spoke to CoinDesk on condition of anonymity, said they will continue to work with Binance because tokens from many projects they’ve invested in are mainly – if not solely – traded on Binance.      Binance has a strong focus on alternative token (altcoin) trading, with more than 1,100 crypto trading pairs available, per data from CoinMarketCap. Outside the exchange, it also runs or supports multiple platforms including an initial exchange offering (IEO) platform called Binance Launchpad, which offers a direct listing and launch campaign for new startup tokens, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a public blockchain that powers numerous successful decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.      “Binance is the king of altcoin liquidity,” Ashwath Balakrishnan, research associate at blockchain research firm Delphi Digital, said. “So [it] would really need sizable outflows [from Binance] to confirm that” altcoin liquidity moves elsewhere.      Many “VIP” users on Binance also value the highly competitive trading fee discounts offered on Binance, a feature that especially benefits those who conduct high-frequency trading strategies, the person from the China-based crypto fund said, whose company is also a Binance VIP client.    China’s importance to Binance    Today, even though Binance has gone much further beyond a local exchange catering to the Chinese market, China remains an essential market for it, just as Binance is also an essential and preferred platform for Chinese crypto traders and investors.      A report by Chainalysis released on Aug. 3 shows that between January and June 2021, more than $150 million worth of cryptocurrency was sent to addresses estimated to be controlled by users in China, second only to the U.S.      Amid further crackdown by the Chinese government on crypto, both Huobi and OKEx recently were reported to be dissolving their entities in China. It is still too early to tell whether Chinese users would partially rebuild their trust with the two exchanges after their respective actions.      A likely winner from Binance’s regulatory downfall could be FTX, the centralized crypto exchange focusing on derivatives products helmed by Sam Bankman-Fried.      “The market changes fast and it’s a fact that FTX is growing,” Trade Terminal’s Yang said.      Data from Skew shows that FTX has surpassed both OKEx and Huobi and is now the second largest crypto exchange by bitcoin futures open interest.      FTX is “becoming very retail friendly, especially after acquiring Blockfolio,” Delphi Digital’s Balakrishnan said, in explaining FTX’s rapid growth. Blockfolio, a crypto mobile news and portfolio tracking app, mainly focuses on a retail customer base.      Interestingly, Binance, an early investor in FTX, recently exited its position in FTX, as Bankman-Fried said that his company bought out Binance’s shares in FTX. The move appears a bit strange as FTX just announced a $900 million funding round, the largest funding round for a crypto exchange in history.      “I think it just makes sense given the role that our businesses are playing in the space,” Bankman-Fried said in an interview with Decrypt, implying that he didn't want Binance's issues with regulators to affect FTX.      At the time of writing, Binance is still the largest bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, contributing $3.17 billion, according to Skew. The number for FTX, the second largest, is about $2.02 billion.      At least for now, Binance’s dominance remains unchallenged.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/04/chinese-crypto-traders-remain-confident-in-binance-despite-regulatory-woes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25000354d1cfe3118825d4c9be81febec88b66d6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42434948,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyQ8sZh,1628099442,Crypto Tax Exemptions Floated for $1T US Senate Bill,"Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) want to ensure miners, node operators, developers and other non-custodial crypto industry participants are exempt from a crypto tax reporting provision in the U.S.' infrastructure bill.      The bill, which seeks to fund $1 trillion in infrastructure improvements at least in part through widened tax enforcement on crypto entities, sparked backlash from the crypto community due to the possibility that it might broaden the definition of a broker to include non-custodial entities that don’t have customers nor provide those types of services. Wyden and Lummis’ amendment, proposed Thursday, seeks to limit this definition specifically to trading platforms and similar types of entities.      The amendment said:    “Nothing in this section … shall be construed to create any inference that a person described in [the bill] includes any person solely engaged in the business of (A) validating distributed ledger transactions, (B) selling hardware or software for which the sole function is to permit a person to control private keys … or (C) developing digital assets or their corresponding protocols for use by other persons, such that such other persons are not customers of the person developing such assets or protocols.”    The amendment also includes a provision that the section on crypto brokers will not modify the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, two major laws overseeing the federal securities markets.      The Senate is currently debating and voting on a number of possible amendments to the bill, which has bipartisan support in the upper house of the U.S. Congress. Another of these amendments, introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), seeks to “strike” the provision, although the text of that amendment was not immediately available.      In a statement, Lummis said that the amendment is a first step to integrating crypto with the current U.S. economy, though “much more work needs to be done.”      “The digital asset and financial technology space is incredibly complicated, and we have spent long hours working in the Senate with industry stakeholders and with the Administration to find a way to effectively integrate digital assets into our tax code without harming the technology or stifling innovation. I look forward to continuing this bipartisan work to bring our financial industry into the 21st century,” she said.      Wyden said that investors ""failing to pay tax"" through cryptocurrencies ""is a real problem"" and that he supports the overall thrust of the provision in requiring third-party reporting.      ""Our amendment makes clear that reporting does not apply to individuals developing blockchain technology and wallets. This will protect American innovation while at the same time ensuring those who buy and sell cryptocurrency pay the taxes they already owe,"" he said in a statement.      Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who likely introduced the original provision into the tax bill, defended the phrasing in a Twitter thread late Tuesday.      Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Blockchain Association, Coinbase, Coin Center, Ribbit Capital and Square expressed support for the amendment, pointing to the original broad definition of ""broker.""      ""Clarifying the provision to address our concerns would not affect the reporting requirements on crypto exchanges that operate on behalf of customers. We support sensible reporting requirements that are consistent with those that apply to traditional financial services,"" the statement said.    Blockchain and cybersecurity    Separately, Lummis filed another amendment with Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) that would task federal regulators with evaluating different tools to track illegal transactions made using cryptocurrencies.      The amendment would apply to a section on cybersecurity within the infrastructure bill.      If the amendment is adopted and the bill is passed, these federal agency heads, which include the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and FBI, as well as the Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General, would have 180 days to develop a joint agreement on what digital asset analytics tools can and can't do, as well as possible improvements.      The agencies would also have to provide any recommendations on how they can mitigate any illegal activity occurring through the use of cryptocurrencies.      Lummis said cryptocurrencies could be used for both good and bad purposes, just as cash can.      ""We need to ensure that agencies of jurisdiction have the strategies and resources to harness that built-in security to combat money laundering and other nefarious activity. This amendment will do just that, and I’m grateful to Senator Blackburn for working with me to make this happen,"" she said in a statement.      The amendments still need to be voted on, and the Senate is expected to discuss these issues through the rest of the week. At the end of the amendment period, lawmakers will vote to actually advance the bill.      However, the overall process of passing the infrastructure bill into law is likely to take months. After the Senate completes its work, the bill will go to the House of Representatives, which will also discuss the bill before voting on it.

42434955,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyQ8slh,1628091354,CBDCs Can Stop Aid Falling Into Terrorist Hands,"Years ago, when I first discovered blockchain, I believed Bitcoin would be the panacea to international aid tracking – that is, making sure that donor money is spent in the way it was intended. Though cryptocurrencies are developing quickly, I now find it hard to believe that bitcoin or ethereum will be effective international aid relief in our near-term future. However, I find new hope with central bank digital currencies (CBDC).      CBDCs could actually provide a perfect solution for tracking and monitoring international aid funds. In fact, the Bank of Israel’s recent announcement about the potential issuance of a digital shekel could be a game changer for countries looking to track aid funds to the region, specifically to Gaza.    Netta Korin is now a co-founder at Orbs as well as the Hexa Foundation. Previously, she worked on Wall Street and held senior advisor positions in the Israeli Prime Minister's Office. CoinDesk's Crypto State: Middle East virtual event is August 11.    Blockchain could be used to track aid funds in order to ensure the funds arrive at their desired destination. Gaza’s current circumstances are an example of illicit use of funds, because according to estimates, Hamas has siphoned $1.25 billion in international humanitarian aid funds to finance terror activity against Israel.      Happily, it seems that the donor countries have come to realize that their funds are being misused by Hamas and are therefore looking for ways to ensure that this no longer occurs. Orbs has been developing a blockchain-based solution to provide full transparency for managing the budget of any project by tracking funds and monitoring all know-your-customer (KYC) processes in order to guarantee that aid funds reach only the whitelisted recipients.      Any solution to solve aid tracking must consist of two core elements: the tracking mechanism (including identification measures) and the funds-transfer mechanism. In our multiple years of working toward this solution, we have seen that perhaps the most significant hurdle is integrating the two. That is understandable, as full control over fund transfers is not only difficult to implement, but is also dependent on third parties and exogenous constraints. Thus, the greatest challenge is providing a fully digital payment platform that is widely accepted by all third parties and implemented.      Because funding organizations vary in terms of vision and being tech savvy, and because there are usually constraints such as infrastructure in the supported country or varying degrees of trust in the local banking system, there needs to be flexibility for organizations to optimize tracking potential according to the conditions at hand.      In effect, there are three potential levels of implementation to a blockchain-based aid tracking solution, differentiated by their varying degree of control over the fund transfers, which is determined by the level of integration between both mechanisms. Let us explore them:    Basic    Funds are transferred over an external platform that is not integrated with the solution. This requires users to report transactions and have them properly approved before they are transferred. Only the transfers are manually updated as executed. In essence, this in effect is running a parallel accounting system, but on the blockchain. While at first this method might not seem that different from existing solutions, it is in fact an enormous improvement compared to the way things currently work. First, because it is immutable. Second and as important, because at least in theory, all transactions are reported and approved in real time and are transparent to funding parties, as opposed to only the project management units.    Intermediate    Funds are transferred over an external platform that is fully integrated using application programming interfaces (APIs) to the tracking mechanism. While the tracking mechanism is not in full control of fund transfers, the feedback is fully automated, thus minimizing user intervention for a more reliable reporting. This method provides a substantial upgrade in terms of the platform’s automation and reliability, but it is much more complicated to implement. The integration with third-party platforms such as banks and SWIFT is the main weakness here, as we (the developers) must depend on their cooperation for it to function properly. In that aspect, this method is the only one of the three where implementation is not entirely in our hands.    Full    All funds are transferred overthe platform, i.e. they are fully digitized and seamlessly integrated with the tracking mechanism. This method allows full control over funds transfer in real time, providing maximum transparency. The challenge is having a blockchain-based funds-transfer platform that is approved by the most conservative entities (governments, banks, etc.), which makes a CBDC the perfect solution, because governments are more likely to trust a government-issued currency than bitcoin or ether.      As we can see, CBDC provides the best, most seamless method for preventing misuse of aid funds. It is worth noting, however, that no matter which method is chosen, each option provides one of the most important features for any budget-monitoring solution, which currently is missing in the international community – immutability. That means that each transaction and all its relevant metadata are forever documented for present and future audits, without the ability to erase or edit it once it was carried out. Just a little something to keep in mind for anyone who signs a transaction.      Assuming that the Bank of Israel continues its momentum with the digital shekel, it would have a major impact on the efficacy of a funds track and trace solution for Gaza. First, the Israeli shekel is already a currency in Gaza, along with the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the transition to a digital shekel would be flawless, eliminating potential frictions caused by the transition to a different currency.      In addition, because the platform will be permissioned and as all entities onboarding the platform are KYCed, most – if not all – privacy matters are inherently covered on the platform. Furthermore, this implementation will accelerate the migration to digital wallets in Gaza, not only to those who onboard the platform, but also to the rest of the population, thus driving the modernization of the local economy, empowering individuals and, one would hope, depriving Hamas of funds.      Deploying this existing platform using a digital shekel would mean that every penny donated would be accounted for. In the case of Gaza, incoming international aid funds would be converted to digital shekels by the Bank of Israel and redirected to individuals’ designated digital accounts, with each family receiving $100, or the equivalent in digital shekels, as planned. With 100,000 supported families, the migration toward a full digital economy would be imminent, driving more (identified) services providers to accept the new digital form of payment, thus eliminating cash.      To rebuild Gaza, infrastructure projects will need tracking, as well. In this case, the “rules of engagement” are predetermined by the funding organizations and are enforced by code that cannot be overridden (for example, funds are dispersed only if they meet, say, KYC checks). The funds are managed by each project’s management unit, with the key difference being that transfers are tracked step by step and fully controlled; i.e. they cannot be carried out unless certain conditions are met (e.g. proper KYC, a job was successfully completed, etc.), and they are capped (pending recipients, project milestones or any other prerequisite). Most importantly, funding organizations always get the real-time full picture of the project’s progress to make sure that funds reach their destination – humanitarian aid to Gazans rather than rebuilding Hamas’s terror infrastructure.      Recently, the Israeli Ministry of Defense published a seizure order for Hamas-attributed digital wallets. According to an estimate from Elliptic, a crypto analytics firm, these wallets received nearly $7.7 million. While these are not aid funds per se, it still shows that the international community must be on guard against nefarious actors looking to exploit technology – including blockchain. Aid agencies must focus and understand the opportunities and threats of new technologies. As we all know, technology can advance good as well as evil.      Unfortunately, many accept that a significant portion of financial aid does not arrive at the intended destination and ends up instead as elite capture or even worse, as terror funding. There does seem to be a change in demand for accountability, as donors are not willing to accept the pilfering of funds anymore.      Up until now, a crucial element was missing in order to provide a perfect and seamless process for countries or institutions to implement. CBDC was the missing piece. It could be a breakthrough in efficient global giving. I certainly hope that Israel, and other countries, will realize the potential CBDCs have to affect global giving, and implement a solution that guarantees that aid no longer goes astray.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Netta Korin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/04/cbdcs-can-stop-aid-falling-into-terrorist-hands,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d11bfde180f4c90e37942663572ec756f18c182-1400x914.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

LaValle is Grayscale’s first hire for its exchange-traded fund business following the posting in the spring of several job listings by Grayscale for ETF specialists. (Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.)      Before Alerian, LaValle spent time at various stock exchanges, built out ETF listings at Nasdaq and led a segment of State Street’s ETF business as head of the bank’s capital markets team.      According to LaValle, a bitcoin ETF is part of the natural evolution of ETFs.

A bitcoin ETF would be a retail-accessible trading vehicle offering both individuals and institutions exposure to the bitcoin market without having to hold bitcoin itself. The industry has long clamored for an ETF, and several bitcoin ETF applications are under review at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      About a month after those job listings were created, Grayscale said in a blog post that it is “100% committed” to converting GBTC into an ETF.

Genesis, which is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk, reported that it is seeing bitcoin’s role changing in the bear market. From late 2020 until the end of the second quarter, Genesis saw bitcoin’s dominance in market cap decline from over 70% to under 45%, while ether and prominent DeFi tokens doubled in value during that time.      According to Genesis’ report, bitcoin accounted for 42% of the firm’s loan book in the second quarter – a drop of 12 percentage points from the end of 2020 – and bitcoin spot trading was down to 47% in the second quarter from highs of 80% in last year's fourth quarter.      As DeFi grows and attracts the attention of institutional investors, demand for ether is also growing. Hedge funds are increasingly turning to Genesis and other lenders to borrow ETH to deploy into DeFi protocols.      That trend was evident in the second quarter, when the firm had $25 billion in new originations, its largest amount ever in a quarter. The figure was up eightfold from a year earlier. The firm’s cumulative originated value is now $66 billion since its launch in 2018.      The report also attempts to explain the crypto market crash this spring, which saw bitcoin plummet from highs of nearly $65,000 in April to $35,000 at the end of the first quarter. Tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk that the car maker would no longer accept bitcoin as payment, concerns about the impact bitcoin mining has on the environment, a “dangerously levered market,” regulatory scrutiny, “a spate of negative headlines” and crackdowns on crypto miners in China were all cited as triggering a “cascade of liquidations and exhausted order book bids.”      Genesis’ report also looks ahead to technology upgrades, including Bitcoin’s upcoming Taproot activation and EIP 1559, which will change how Ethereum fees work. It also highlights the development of layer 2 scaling products like Optimism and Arbitrum in the DeFi sector.      “Progress on the industry’s fundamentals combined with growing interest from traditional market participants will continue to push the sector forward,” the report concludes.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/04/ethereum-and-defi-not-bitcoin-boosting-genesis-lending,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/670ecb7a44e3e862455607bed3e3849023ed2ae9-2000x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42434950,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyQ8sfh,1628082000,Valkyrie Launches a Dash Trust That Includes Staking,"Valkyrie Digital Assets is offering its third closed-end crypto fund that includes staking on top of exposure to the underlying asset.      The digital asset manager launched a trust denominated in dash, a cryptocurrency that is designed for payments. Earlier this year, it launched Algorand Trust and a Polkadot Trust.      “This was actually supposed to be our second trust that we launched after bitcoin,” said Steven McClurg, Valkyrie’s chief investment officer. “The hardest piece was the staking part. There’s a lot of tax law considerations that we have to go through when we launch any sort of staking within a trust.”      Valkyrie didn't reveal the yield on the trust, but added that it would trade on over-the-counter markets where it would be available to retail investors.      “I’m personally very excited to see a product that I can more easily point institutions and individuals [to] looking to hold dash in a retirement account,” said Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core Group, the company that developed the dash coin.      The fund will allow institutions to gain exposure to staking dash without having to run a ""master node,"" which would require them to hold 1,000 dash. That would cost about $163,000 at current prices, compared with the $25,000 minimum investment for the Valkyrie trust.      Taylor also told CoinDesk that he hopes to one day see a Dash exchange-traded fund (ETF), or for Valkyrie’s trust to be converted into an ETF. McClurg added that Valkyrie would begin looking into ETF conversion for its non-bitcoin trusts after a bitcoin ETF has been approved in the U.S. and the other digital assets have reached a market capitalization that satisfies the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's aim for liquidity for those assets.

Circle, the principal operator of USDC, worked with blockchain domain name provider Unstoppable Domains to bring this function to its users, with domains starting at $40.  The collaboration is designed to bring increased simplicity and accessibility to USDC payments, with users able to exchange usernames followed by the .coin domain.  As much as the crypto sector grows, sending and receiving payments using a long sequence of random alphanumeric characters as an address could remain a barrier to some users, with fear of funds going astray.  Being able to use a simple username akin to a Twitter or Instagram handle may help ease those concerns and uncertainty, and make sending crypto payments more like sending an email or a text.  Users are prevented from co-opting recognized brands such as Apple or Google to ensure only the brand owner can claim that handle, Unstoppable Domains co-founder Brad Kam told CoinDesk.

Bright Star Studios, the game's Danish developer, will sort through the applications before choosing candidates to purchase the 6,000 plots of land available in the Solarwood Nation, one of ""Ember Sword’s"" four virtual worlds.      Owning land in ""Ember Sword"" gives gamers the opportunity to share in trading fees and earn Ember, the game’s ERC-20 token, from economic activity on and around their virtual plots of land.      ""Ember Sword,"" which plans to conduct testing for virtual land owners and select community members later this year, is following in the footsteps of other play-to-earn blockchain-based games like ""Axie Infinity"" that are revolutionizing online gaming.      “We are working to develop a player-driven economy that allows gamers to earn rewards and make money through in-game activities, including the creation of unique, tradable NFT (non-fungible token) items,” Mark Laursen, CEO of Bright Star Studios, said in a statement.      Bright Star founder Loren Roosendaal estimates that 70%-80% of applications for the NFT land sale came from individual gamers, and groups including Twitch streamers, virtual real estate firms and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) like Yield Guild Games accounted for the rest.      ""Ember Sword’s"" most recent land sale comes after a $1.5 million sale in May, which Roosendaal told CoinDesk struggled with technical challenges after demand exceeded Bright Star’s expectations.

Network stakeholders including decentralized application (dapp) developers and core developers came together on Friday, July 30, for a final coordination meeting over Zoom. During the meeting, developers discussed the long-term plan to resolve a recondite issue of EIP 1559 that makes debugging applications on Ethereum more difficult. More on what the issue is and why there’s not a clear solution to it yet in this week’s New Frontiers.    This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Pulse check    The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week.    Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.    New frontiers: Debugging the code    In order to maintain backward compatibility with wallets and blockchain services that facilitate transactions on Ethereum, the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 retains a field for these services to specify a gas price.      Traditionally, a gas price is the conversion rate between units of gas and ether that a user sets when sending a transaction to incentivize miners on the network to include their transaction in a block. (More information about gas in this research report.) With the implementation of EIP 1559, a minimum gas price called the “base fee” will be determined automatically by the network to help improve the efficiency and predictability of Ethereum’s fee market.      Instead of specifying a gas price, users will only be required to specify a maximum willingness to pay for their transactions. Once specified, the network will deduct the base fee from a user’s maximum willingness to pay and return the difference back to a user’s account balance.      The current code specifications for EIP 1559 returns the value for a user’s maximum willingness to pay as the gas price only before the transaction is mined into a block. After being mined, the value for the gas price field changes to the base fee. A changing value based on time and the state of the blockchain presents a new challenge for dapp developers trying to debug their code.      “Any time you’re debugging an issue and the behaviour changes based on when you look at it, that becomes a very, very hard bug to debug. I suspect that most users and dapp developers and library authors and whatnot probably are not watching closely on these things and they will not realize that there’s a change in behaviour and the gas price field,” said independent software developer Micah Zoltu about this issue on July 23 during an All Core Developers meeting.      Zoltu suggested deprecating the gas price field during the next backward-incompatible upgrade, Shanghai, as a possible solution. However, others have since argued deprecating the field during the forthcoming Shanghai upgrade, tentatively expected for October, would break the functionality of several wallets and blockchain tooling services.      The creator of Ethereum code library ether.js, Richard Moore, said during Friday’s EIP 1559 Coordination Call, “I definitely want it longer than just [Shanghai] … I was looking the other day, there’s still, I think … 50% of users that are still on antiquated versions of [ether.js].”      Instead, Moore suggested a versioning system that would retain the legacy fields of EIP 1559 where, eventually, if users try to get information about the gas price value of a transaction, they will receive an error message specifying the command for this field is no longer supported by the current version of software.    Taking a cautious approach    Another possibility in lieu of a versioning system for Ethereum would be to fix the return value of the gas price field to a static number such as negative one or zero, which would dissuade developers from using this field for any meaningful debugging.      While developers figure out how to deal with this issue, certain Ethereum tooling services such as cryptocurrency wallet Argent and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase are holding off on making changes to their user interface (UI) to support EIP 1559 at its outset.      Internally, all Ethereum-related services that connect to the network will need to upgrade their software in time for activation of EIP 1559. However, updating user-facing elements of an application or platform to support the many features enabled by EIP 1559, such as a maximum willingness to pay as opposed to a gas price, can come later.      “It's not unreasonable to wait and see how [EIP 1559] plays out a little bit before deciding how to present things [and] making changes in your UI,” said Ethereum Foundation’s Trenton Van Epps.    Validated takes    Ether has notched a 12-day winning streak in the run-up to the London upgrade. BACKGROUND: Blockchain data firm IntoTheBlock noted $2,598 and $2,753 as key resistance levels on the path toward $3,000. (Article, CoinDesk)      Non-fungible token (NFT) sales for the cartoon TV show “Stoner Cats” caused an influx of transactions on Ethereum that temporarily drove network transaction fees up 250%. BACKGROUND: “Stoner Cats” is reportedly the first TV series funded entirely by NFTs. The show raised over $8 million Wednesday and features voice acting from the founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin and Hollywood celebrity Mila Kunis. (Article, CoinDesk)      Following the London upgrade, EIP 3074 and 3675 will be important upcoming code changes on Ethereum for stakeholders to keep an eye on. BACKGROUND: EIP 3074 improves user experience with ‘batched-transactions’ that can contain both approvals and transactions, which are currently separated, costing additional gas and time. EIP 3675 is titled “Upgrade Consensus to Proof of Stake” and takes us one step closer to The Merge. (Blog post, DailyGwei)      Genesis Trading and Arca are speaking to a new wave of investors interested in Ethereum, DeFi and NFTs. BACKGROUND: Traditionally, investors in the digital asset space have started with interest in bitcoin that eventually trickled down into more niche areas of cryptocurrency. However, Noelle Acheson of Genesis (a CoinDesk sister company) and Jeff Dorman of Arca have witnessed a surge in new customers showing interest in “more relatable” assets.

While declining to provide specifics, a spokesman for Howard said the billionaire investor considers the size of the investment to be “negligible.”  While it is unknown what Howard considers “negligible,” how much the stake is worth now or when he first invested in Iconic, the well-known financier owned around 5.8% of the company as of May, the filing says.  Howard has been an active investor in the crypto market for some time. Up until recently, Elwood Asset Management had managed his personal digital assets, and he was recently involved in the funding round for the FTX crypto derivatives exchange, the largest funding round in crypto history.  In June, the billionaire participated in an extension of the Series B funding round for crypto custody business Copper, and he also made a $4 million investment in crypto trading app Kikitrade.

42407110,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfBOIv,1628075348,Analysts Take Cautious Stance on Ether as London Hard Fork Nears,"As the crypto community awaits the supposedly bullish London hard fork on the Ethereum blockchain, some analysts are taking a cautious stance on ether and foresee little price reaction after the upgrade.      ""I don't expect much action in any direction,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger said. ""The upgrade itself is overrated, and what matters is what happens after.""      Ether is the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, which is scheduled to undergo a hard fork, or backward-incompatible upgrade, called ""London,"" on Thursday. The change will implement four proposals, including the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 that will activate a mechanism to burn a portion of fees paid to miners.      Once the upgrade takes effect, it is expected to bring a deflationary asset appeal to ether, possibly drawing more investment demand for the cryptocurrency. That's the popular narrative in the crypto community. ""Deflationary ETH upgrade EIP-1559 scheduled. Today's dip is a blessing,"" Simon Dedic, managing partner at Moonrock Capital, tweeted on Tuesday.      However, while the upgrade will introduce a burn mechanism, the amount of ether destroyed will depend on the actual network usage. In other words, EIP-1559 does not directly influence ether's supply. In that sense, the bullish narrative appears overdone for now, Kruger said.      Matthew Dibb, chief operations officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said these types of changes are similar to bitcoin halvings and take time to exert an effect. ""Long-term, we believe that ether will see significant price appreciation as a result of this upgrade,"" Dibb said. ""However, we aren't expecting an immediate move in either direction.""      Bitcoin halving refers to a programmed code that reduces the per-block issuance of the cryptocurrency by half every four years. Halving makes bitcoin's monetary policy predictable. The EIP upgrade does the exact opposite.      ""It is difficult, however, to predict exactly how much ether will be burnt over time given that the base fee dynamically adjusts according to network activity and demand for block space,"" CoinDesk's Christine Kim noted.      Another source of uncertainty is the impact of EIP-1559 on miner economics and how the community will respond after the upgrade. According to Compass Mining, miners will see their revenue dip by 20% to 30% after the upgrade because part of their fees will be burnt.      All these things will become apparent over time. Thus, traders may sit on the fence in the short-term – more so as the popular bullish narrative appears to have been priced in, according to Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange.      The price of ether doubled to $4,000 in the four weeks to mid-May, decoupling from the then rangebound bitcoin mainly on the back of the belief that the EIP upgrade would reduce ether's supply. The cryptocurrency charted a record 12-day winning trend from July 21 to Aug. 2, gaining nearly 50%.      ""The upcoming upgrade could be a nonevent,"" Balani said. ""The cryptocurrency remains dependent on bitcoin in terms of price action in the short-term.""      The options market seems to agree with Balani. Ether's one-month implied volatility continues its sideways churn, a sign investors don't expect big moves over the next four weeks.      ""The combination of the market running up into technical resistance at a time when the event is happening could indeed translate to a sell-the-fact reaction,"" Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said. However, setbacks, if any, are likely to be well supported down into the $2,000 area, he said.      Ether is currently trading near $2,500, having reached two-month highs above $2,650 on Sunday, CoinDesk 20 data show. The cryptocurrency has declined by 0.12% in the past 24 hours, while bitcoin has lost 1.3%.      Balani foresees ether rallying to $3,000 if bitcoin manages to secure a foothold above the long-held resistance of $40,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is priced at about $38,250 at press time.

Sydney-based Holon Global Investments says it's a ""global equities manager focused on innovation and investor aligned wealth management.""  Holon's Wholesale Filecoin Fund will be managed by the exchange's regulated custody service, according to a press release on Tuesday.  The fund seeks to raise A$25 million ($18.4 million) over a three-month period, promising clients a 100% FIL return over five years with a 0% management fee.  FIL is the native token of the decentralized data-sharing Filecoin network.  ""The fund was designed to give investors an opportunity to invest in a unique asset,"" Eugene Ng, Gemini's head of business development for Asia Pacific, told CoinDesk. ""This allows investors to diversify their portfolios and also receive an attractive rate of return.""  In order to generate returns, the companies say the fund will purchase FIL and lend the token to a Holon subsidiary.  ""For every Filecoin Holon Innovations borrows from the fund, it will pay the fund two filecoins at maturity. This structure gives investors a return on their investment in the form of additional filecoin,"" Ng said.  Gemini said the partnership is part of its push into Southeast Asia that began in earnest at the start of last month.

Kitco Gold (KGLD) will be fully backed by physical gold held in Kitco's DirectReserve vaults and will track the real-time market value of the yellow metal, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk on Wednesday.      The initial trading date for KGLD hasn't been set yet, but it will be in the coming weeks, according to a spokesperson.      Hong Kong's First Digital Trust will provide regulatory compliance, know-your-customer and anti-money laundering procedures, funds processing and final authorization. Stablecoin issuer Stably will provide smart contract technology for minting and burning KGLD on the Ethereum network, and Tradewind Markets will assist in settlement.      The stablecoin attempts to combine the safe-haven nature of owning gold with the flexibility and transparency of a digital asset, Kitco said.      Kitco provides precious metals news and data used by millions to access the market prices of gold, silver, palladium and other metals. Its users will now gain access to the digital equivalent of Kitco’s depositories and vaults, which are audited to industry standards, according to Kitco's press release.      John Dourekas, a Kitco spokesman, said KGLD represents a digital receipt of physical gold ownership and provides institutional investors with a ""robust"" asset class.      ""Investors will have a competitive alternative to traditional gold products such as gold ETFs (exchange-traded funds), with the additional benefits of real-time trading and settlement enabled by blockchain technology,” Dourekas said.      Kitco's entrance into gold-backed stablecoins follows Paxos Gold and Tether Gold, which launched their versions of the coins in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Though Kitco's endeavor comes later, market participants will likely welcome the gold bug's attempt to pry some market share from dominant stablecoin issuers, Kitco said.

42407106,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfBOD1,1628049430,Ohio Sen. Rob Portman Defends Crypto Provision in US Infrastructure Bill,"U.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R.-Ohio) is defending a controversial crypto provision slipped into the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that's being debated in the Senate.      The provision seeks to raise $28 billion in taxes from crypto businesses by applying new information reporting requirements to exchanges and potentially other types of crypto services.      Portman argues his ""common sense"" provision will provide more clarity and legitimacy for the crypto industry by standardizing information reporting by brokers to the Internal Revenue Service.      The controversy centers around the definition of the term ""broker"" as any person who provides a service ""effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person."" Some argue that has wide-reaching implications and could extend to decentralized exchanges as well as to crypto miners.      Decentralized exchanges were explicitly named in an earlier draft of the provision, though the term was removed in the final version published late Sunday.      Portman has struck back at criticism over the legislation, saying the bill's language doesn't impose new reporting requirements on software developers, crypto miners, node operators or other non-brokers.      ""It simply says that brokers must comply with standard information reporting obligations. Which many already do,"" the senator said.      There is bipartisan opposition to the provision, however. Sens. Ron Wyden (D.-Ore.), Cynthia Lummis (R.-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R.-Penn.) are working on an amendment to modify the language, though how they intend to do so isn't known yet.

42407112,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfBOGx,1628042950,BSV Suffers 51% Attack: Report,"Cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV suffered a 51% attack Tuesday morning, according to an analyst from the crypto intelligence firm Coin Metrics. The attack is continuing into Wednesday, according to another security expert.    The attack was still underway as of 7:30 UTC on Wednesday, said Kim Nilsson, a bitcoin security expert known for his investigation into the Mt. Gox attack.  The reorgs are continuing and ""by now I've lost track of all the various chain tips,"" Nilsson told CoinDesk via Telegram.  Coin Metrics corroborated Nuzzi's report later on Tuesday, tweeting that its blockchain security monitoring tool FARUM saw a 14-block reorg of the network.  According to Nilsson, the first reorg on Tuesday was about 100 blocks deep. Nikita Zhavoronkov, the lead developer at Blockchain analytics platform Blockchair, agreed in a tweet, adding that it wiped 570,000 transactions.  Coin Metrics said late on Tuesday that the attack had ended, but that there was still confusion between mining pools. Pools are mining on ""completely different"" block heights at the moment, Nuzzi told CoinDesk in a message late on Tuesday.  A 51% attack occurs when malicious miners take control of more than 50% of a proof-of-work blockchain. The attackers can take advantage of block reorganization, a feature meant to clear up incidences when two miners have mined the same block.  Broadly speaking, when two versions of the same blocks are mined, the system defaults to the longest chain. By mining faster than the honest miners during a 51% attack, the assailants can create a longer chain so that the system will render the honest miners' blocks invalid.  The Bitcoin Association for BSV recommended that node operators invalidate the fraudulent chain.  This mitigation strategy has ""further split the network as different nodes now disagree on the current chain tip,"" Nilsson said.  Bitcoin SV, which was born through a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, suffered four attacks in July.  There is no ""clear indication"" of the attacker's identity, and Coin Metrics is still looking into the attacker's chain for ""traces of double spends targeting exchanges,"" Nuzzi said.  Major BSV mining pools are still struggling to align on the same blockchain, he said.  The BSV hashrate fell by almost 50% from Monday to Tuesday, according to Bitinfocharts. But Nuzzi said that due to the confusion after the reorg, it's hard to estimate how much the hashrate has dropped.  Attacks on BSV and similar cryptocurrencies are ""cheap and straightforward to perform"" because they use the same algorithm as Bitcoin but are not protected by a large hashrate, Nilsson said.    UPDATE (AUG. 4, 04:00 UTC): Added quote from Lucas Nuzzi and information on hashrate and block reorgs.      CORRECTION (AUG. 4, 4:00 UTC): The block reorg was 14 blocks, according to CoinMetrics.
