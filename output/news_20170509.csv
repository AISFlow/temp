42375633,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9Nrz,1494357320,Hungary's Central Bank Organizes Task Force Against OneCoin,"Hungary's government has set its sights on OneCoin, a digital currency investment scheme widely believed to be fraudulent.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB), the country's central bank, announced today that it is part of a wide-ranging task force aimed at cracking down on ""certain elements of the alleged pyramid scheme"". The development represents one of the most aggressive to date against the alleged scam.  OneCoin is an investment program centered around a purported digital currency through which investors are promised huge returns on their purchases. Participants are encouraged to find other investors as well, drawing the allegation that OneCoin is little more than a fraud.  Who's involved: The following agencies or institutions are participating in the OneCoin task force:  The MNB, by way of its Market Surveillance Working Group  The Budapest Police's main office  The National Bureau of Investigation  The National Tax and Customs Administration  The Interior MinistryThe Prosecutor General's Office, as well as the Municipal Prosecutor's Office.  Why this is big: Recent signs indicate the regulatory bodies, particularly in Europe and Asia, are starting to take more concrete action against OneCoin.  The past few weeks have seen officials India arrest nearly two dozen individuals connected to the scheme while Germany’s top finance regulator, BaFin, effectively banned it after shuttering a related payment processor. Both countries have seized funds from promoters’ accounts.  Yet the Hungarian move is notable given the wide range of agencies parties involved. The task force brings together police, prosecutors, financial watchdogs and central bankers – all in the name of taking ""action against OneCoin"", to quote the MNB's release.

Neel Kashkari, a former Bush administration official who became president of the Minneapolis Fed in early 2016, gave a speech during the MN High Tech Association 2017 Spring Conference, held this afternoon.  Asked by an attendee about the Fed's position on digital currencies, Kashkari went on to make the following points:  The Fed is watching: ""This is a topic a lot of people across the Fed are paying attention to and watching how it evolves.""  His issue is with 'inflation by altcoin': ""The problem I have [with bitcoin] is while it says, by design, you're limiting the number of bitcoins that can be created, it doesn’t stop me from creating NeelCoin or somebody from creating Bobcoin or Marycoin or Susiecoin.""  Blockchain 'has more potential': ""I would say the conventional wisdom now is that blockchain, the underlying technology, is probably more interesting and has more potential than maybe bitcoin does by itself.""  The waiting game continues: ""I think it's too early to know where this is going to go ... we'll see – we have a lot to learn.""  His comments represent the latest remarks out of the Federal Reserve about digital currencies and blockchain, coming months after the Federal Reserve published its first major research findings on the tech.  Nor is he the latest Fed official to comment on blockchain. In January, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen called blockchain an ""important technology"" during an event appearance.

State lawmakers want to see how they could attract startups working with the tech, and by consequence, boost employment and drive new revenue sources, according to the text of Senate Bill 135.  Agencies such as the state’s Attorney General’s Office, the Department of Financial Regulation and the Vermont Law School’s Center for Legal Innovation would be involved if the bill is ultimately signed into law.  What’s being done: According to the bill, legislators are pushing for the following action items:  An assessment both the opportunities and risks around financial technologies like blockchain – to quote the text, lawmakers want to ""respond to these developing opportunities and concerns on an informed basis"".  Concrete proposals for legislative and regulatory changes. The state has already moved in this direction in recent months, having passed a law last week that updates the state’s money transmission laws to account for digital currencies.  An approach that avoids derailing entrepreneurs – in the words of the bill’s authors, the state should ""not create avoidable risks for individuals and enterprises in the new e-economy"".  Why this is big: Vermont has been laying the groundwork for an inclusive environment for digital currency and blockchain firms, even go so far as testing concepts for public sector applications. While the results haven’t been completely positive, it nonetheless signals that Vermont is taking blockchain seriously.  It’s also the latest signal that states are taking point on legislation around blockchain in the absence of concrete action out of the US Congress. Lawmakers in Hawaii and Maine, among others, are also pushing for studies of a similar nature.

The Financial Services Development Council (FSDC), formed in 2013 to provide guidance on industry issues, put out a new discussion paper published this morning that calls for government action in several key areas.  Here are the key recommendations from the FSDC report:  Prep for digital currencies: The FSDC wants Hong Kong to get ready for digital currencies, naming China specifically and citing ""the likely issuance of digital RMB"".  Establish R&D spaces: Tentatively called a ""DLT Hub"", the plan would include the development of a research-and-development center focused on public-private collaboration. If established, that initiative would dovetail with efforts by Hong Kong's de facto central bank.  Prove the concepts: The group is pressing Hong Kong's government to get hands-on with blockchain. The FSDC also wants Hong Kong to up its spending on blockchain: ""To provide effective demonstration of DLT’s capabilities and benefits, this work should be given higher priority, backed by more substantial funding, and extended under 'Finance', 'Smart City' and 'Trade and Logistics' themes.""  Take the lead: Hong Kong needs a ""DLT lead function"" to spearhead public-sector initiatives around blockchain. This individual or office (the report doesn’t specify) would serve as a catalyst for public-sector applications who, in part, would ""promote the technology"".  Striking a somewhat dramatic tone, the report urges Hong Kong to move expeditiously – or risk being left behind.  ""Hong Kong needs to commit to DLT now in order to reserve a place for itself in a potentially very different world,"" the group concluded.  Read the full report here.

42399841,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyshI,1494338416,Australian's New Budget Includes a Bitcoin Tax Cut,"Australia's latest national budget eliminates goods-and-services tax (GST) on bitcoin purchases.  The cut, announced today by the Australian Department of the Treasury, brings an end to a years-long controversy over the way consumers faced the prospect of paying double GST when first buying, then spending digital currencies.  The government began looking into the matter in mid-2015, and the removal of the tax comes just days after officials reaffirmed their pledge to resolve the issue. If the new budget is approved, the policy will go into effect on 1st July, according to the Treasury Department.  The Australian government noted that the new budget ""will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia"".  Officials unveiled their plan to eliminate the GST charge on digital currencies last year, as part of a wide-ranging statement on fintech.  The budget also includes support for a previously announced fintech accelerator program. The goal, according to the government, is to provide a two-year window for new technology firms to test financial products in a limited setting – a strategy that a number of governments and central banks worldwide have pursued in recent months.  “Robust consumer protections and disclosure requirements will be in place to protect customers including responsible lending obligations, best interest duty, and the need for adequate compensation and dispute resolution arrangements,” the Treasury Department said of the program.  While not part of today's release, Australia is also weighing potential regulatory changes to account for blockchain applications.

42399834,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbysaP,1494335720,How Blockchain Could Finally Unite the United Nations,"The United Nations is a Swiss army knife of humanitarian aid.  When catastrophe strikes, dozens of agencies within the organization, founded in the aftermath of World War II, lay in wait in offices around the world, each with their own specialized role to alleviate suffering and establish peace.  But with billions of dollars at their disposal and organizational mandates that often overlap, keeping track of who needs what, and getting it to them quickly, is just part of the challenge.  Crucial to ensuring continued support, the agencies must also be able to prove that the taxpayer money donated by its 193 member nations actually accomplished its intended goals - a historically difficult balancing act.  One man, who has spent the last 25 years helping conduct this symphony of services, thinks that much of the difficulty can be alleviated by moving both the dispersal of aid and the internal operations of the UN itself to a blockchain.  For the past four months, the newly appointed special advisor for UN engagement and blockchain technology at the UN's Office for Project Services (UNOPS), Yoshiyuki Yamamoto, has been meeting informally with members of other agencies to imagine what the organization would look like if it was truly united on a blockchain.  Speaking to CoinDesk from UNOPS' New York offices, Yamamoto said:  ""We started thinking about forgetting about traditional competition among UN agencies. There's no point. We are so early stage, let's try to exchange our opinions. We have a lot of lessons, let’s exchange lessons. Let’s see what is going to happen. This is so foundational. It's not time to compete.""  Transparency challenges  Yamamoto's own exposure to bitcoin goes back to 2011 when it was little more than a passing interest. But, it wasn't until last year that he ""by chance"" read Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper that he started to see how an immutable, shared ledger might help align the agencies within the UN.  To demonstrate the inefficiencies of the current system, Yamamoto, the former director of the UNOPS Peace and Security Cluster, told the story of when a hospital in Kabul was so desperate for a generator that it applied to multiple UN agencies for help, only to finally receive five generators.  In another story demonstrating how difficulties proving identity have resulted in aid being diverted from its intended recipients, Yamamoto related how ID cards that entitle their owners to UN supplies have been collected by tribal leaders and traded as currency.  Exactly how much is lost to such waste is hard to say, he said, but this lack of transparency is one reason he now advocates for blockchain.  The problem is so pervasive that, in 2012, the 8th secretary-general of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, stated that corruption in the previous year had prevented 30% of all development assistance from reaching its final destination. To give some idea as to how much this loss might be, that same year, $12.2bn in net disbursements were granted by the UN, according to the Global Policy Forum, a policy watchdog that monitors the work of the agency.  If blockchain can be implemented successfully, Yamamoto believes increased transparency could result in fewer internal disputes and more efficient allocation of resources. As a result, he argued, this might increase the willingness of donors to give money, including individual donors, a largely untapped resource at the moment.  With new donation options that might one day also include cryptocurrency itself, the end result could be more funds to help those in need.  ""If ordinary people can contribute directly to the UN and the international community,"" said Yamamoto, ""that is a completely new avenue of fund flow from rich countries to developing countries.""  Baby steps  Progress towards this vision is slow, but steady.  After discovering unrelated blockchain efforts being conducted within the World Food Program (WFP), the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) and UN Women, Yamamoto reached out to get a better understanding of those groups' work. Yamamoto and these other early supporters established an informal blockchain group shortly after.  Over the following months, Yamamoto said he and other UN representatives frequented multiple Bitcoin NYC Meetups, asking about the potential benefits of the technology to the UN.  Word spread, Yamamoto said, and individual representatives from other UN organizations also expressed interest in getting involved. They agreed to meet in person approximately every other week, when an invited guest from outside the UN would discuss what it might mean if their agencies worked together on a joint blockchain initiative.  Speakers at these events have included the former CEO of ID2020 and advisor to One World Identity, Susan Joseph, and Dickson Nsofor of blockchain startup Humaniq, which last week raised $5m in an initial coin offering (ICO).  Last month, in a published joint request for information (RFI), Yamamoto announced the informal group had grown to seven UN organizations – also including the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the UN Development Group (UNDG). The RFI set out ""to identify potential partners/suppliers for the future work in the area of international humanitarian, development or peacekeeping assistance"".  A week after the RFI was published, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank announced they would be organizing the information in a way that caters to ""the needs of the multinational development and humanitarian community"". The request deadline was also extended to 4th June.  One of the early supporters of the inter-agency blockchain initiative, WFP financial officer Houman Haddad, described the cooperation between initiatives in an interview with CoinDesk, saying that developing the technology collaboratively could help ""harmonize"" humanitarian global aid.  ""We are in discussions with everyone we can be in a discussion with,"" said Haddad, adding that the aim is to involve those parties in the ""design and development"" of the project, rather than just build a system and later tell them ""use it"".  On the table  Since the informal group of UN agencies first met, blockchain activity in the organization has grown. But, as the participants make clear, the meetings are still very informal, with independent work still largely driving the progress.  In March, UN Women partnered with Innovation Norway; in April, the WFP revealed its first large-scale ethereum project; and, earlier this month, the UN Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (Cefact) proposed writing a pair of white papers focused on technical and business implications of blockchain.  Most recently, the group of UN agencies exploring blockchain had its regular meeting on Thursday, 4th May, including invited guest speakers from Microsoft, ConsenSys and the Estonian government’s e-Governance Academy.  ""Rather than I become the messenger,"" Yamamoto said, ""I wanted them to explain for themselves to the other UN attendees.""  Though the event was closed to the media, Yamamoto told CoinDesk afterwards that approximately 10 representatives of the UN were present, including for the first time two from the UN Secretariat.  The group is currently at the earliest stages of exploring multiple blockchain consortia models, including the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and Hyperledger. Concerned about committing to a specific blockchain too early, Yamamoto said participants are keeping an open mind.  ""All options are on the table at the moment,"" he said.  Funding threat  While increased transparency from blockchain might one day lure new donors, the immediate future calls for preserving the donations that already exist.  In spite of a strong record of spending donations on actual aid, US President Donald Trump was elected in part thanks to a series of promises to defund the UN. And he's stayed true to that campaign promise, saying last monthhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/24/remarks-president-trump-working-lunch-un-security-council-ambassadors that looking at the UN budget, costs are ""out of control"" and no one country should take on a ""disproportionate share of the burden militarily or financially"".  With 28.57% of the UN's $7.87bn peacekeeping budget this year coming from the US alone, losing financial support could result in the closure of long-term projects.  Going forward, Yamamoto believes moving more of that money to a blockchain could have the potential to, not only cut back on waste, but also make it easier to prove to taxpayers back home exactly what was accomplished with the money.  Yamamoto concluded:  ""Transparency makes it much easier for the donor government to make a decision. Transparency is a key for them. Because the donor government has to convince their own people. If it’s not transparent, it’s very weak.""

42399846,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyslE,1494332109,ECB DLT Lead: Central Banks Won't Compete on Blockchain Tech,"You might not expect someone at the European Central Bank (ECB), the institution that manages monetary policy and oversees financial market infrastructure for the 28-member European Union, to be interested or even passionate about blockchain tech.  But, Dirk Bullmann, fintech coordinator and adviser to the director general of the ECB, is evidence of how the technology that originally powered bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is beginning to pick up interest in the world's largest institutions. Not only is Bullmann's mandate to explore distributed ledgers, but he's leading a team actively seeking to identify ways to use the tech to enhance the ECB's services.  This isn't to say that Bullmann has bought into the idea that blockchain is disruptive, or that one day the ECB will go so far as to issue its own cryptocurrency. Rather, he thinks it will mark a ""fascinating"" change in how the world exchanges assets, one he believes could enhance, if not redefine, existing financial processes.  But despite a recognition of the opportunity, he said there isn't competitive interest driving central bank's intrigue in utilizing blockchain.  Bullmann told CoinDesk:  ""In the future, even in the vision of a peer-to-peer world, there's always a role for the central bank. There's no race between central banks, we work together.""  To this end, the ECB launched a joint initiative with Japan's central bank in December. Announced by executive board member Yves Mersch, the two institutions resolved to explore the tech and release their findings.  Bullmann's task now is to coordinate with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to explore topics such as how financial market participants could send payments using the technology, prioritizing how a certain payment might be cleared, for instance.  Yet, like other enterprises, the ECB is also looking for faster ways to test how blockchain could be applied to newer markets, ones that don't disrupt or interfere with established practices and working processes. For example, Bullmann's group is exploring how DLT could be used in its new securities clearance platform T2S, a system designed to make it easier for financial institutions to issue securities meant to cross borders.  ""We are currently exploring the idea to offer an issuance service for certain supranational debt securities in the European Union, and we are testing if DLT could potentially be used to offer specific aspects of such a service,"" Bullmann said.  Central securities depositories (CSDs) that participate in T2S today can effectively pool their securities so they can be bought and sold by investors across Europe. Since some technology would need to be selected in standardizing the issuance, Bullmann said DLT was a natural candidate for testing.  ""It allows us to further explore the potential benefits of this technology, and at the same time, see whether it could be used efficiently and safely. It's more of a proof of concept,"" he said.  Why T2S?  Initially designed to help bridge the boundaries between different national institutions, it's perhaps not a surprise that DLT is being considered for T2S. Applying the technology to this type of project makes sense when also considering the ECB's drive to harmonize Europe's differing financial markets.  Further, the idea has been broached by other institutions, with Standard Chartered publishing a 2016 report in which it asked whether DLT could threaten or replace T2S.  The ECB first hinted it could pursue a strategy whereby it examined DLT opportunities as a market operator in a December statement, though it confirmed to CoinDesk trials are actively underway.  ""Our goal is a single financial market in Europe where the markets over time harmonized technical, business, legal, taxation issues, and this is what we analyze before we implement a new service,"" Bullmann said.  The idea is that systems like T2S, which was launched in 2015 and will onboard its final wave of CSD members some time in 2017, will make institutions more interoperable. And Bullmann said there's a broader interest in how DLT could have an impact on this goal.  Yet, T2S offers a baby step into implementing DLT more extensively within the ECB. This is especially important when noting the ECB's worry, which was highlighted in its most recent annual report, that the technology is too immature to use in highly complex financial systems.  In the past, the ECB has opined as to whether DLT would serve this purpose, or ""introduce a new layer of fragmentation"" as outlined in an April 2016 report on the technology.  Work with Japan  As for its work with partners, the ECB said it's more about determining if existing service levels and requirements on safety and efficiency can be met by distributed ledger tech.  Bullmann pointed out that much of the work is focused on modeling payment exchanges between member institutions via smart contracts, or self-executing blockchain-based code.  The idea is that by doing so, liquidity could be improved in markets.  ""In our payment system, you can qualify a payment with a priority as normal, urgent or highly urgent, and there are specific features in the system that makes sure that the payments are settled according to their priority,"" Bullmann explained.  He said this work is serving as the starting point for the banks, one that finds the organization dedicating a three-person team to cooperating in a test environment.  ""The test environment is not entirely comparable to real-life conditions, but this is the starting point of whether the functionalities could meet existing service levels and high requirements on safety and efficiency,"" he said.  Crystal balls  For all the positioning, though, Bullmann is reluctant to make any predictions about where the technology will head, dismissing this as ""speculation"".  ""I sometimes have the impression that the discussion around DLT is driven by the desire just to implement new technology. But, the approach we follow is, first we look at the services our market participants want and the market players need. The question of which technology to use comes in a subsequent step,"" he said.  Bullmann reported having conversations with various market participants who were moving to implement specific DLT use cases, and given those conversations, he suggested the ECB is currently moving in line with the market by analyzing specific, new use cases.  Despite the ECB being one of the more vocal institutions on the subject, Bullmann isn't ready to compare the work done by those abroad. For now, Bullmann said the approach of the ECB, and its peers, is to study, collaborate and assess.  Bullmann concluded:  ""If the market moves to DLT relatively quickly, we have to make sure that the DLT world could smoothly interact with our world.""

At $1,700, bitcoin prices are up 70% already on the year and around $200 on the week, having climbed from $997 in January to set a string of new highs. Minutes before press time, bitcoin's new all-time high on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index was $1,710.96.  As reported by CoinDesk, the uptick comes at a time when broader interest in the crypto markets appears to be increasing and winning new investors. While bitcoin is up 70%, alternative cryptocurrencies are up 600% since March.  The recent price rise, however, puts bitcoin at a level that analysts have suggested could prove a key resistance.  CoinDesk contributor Willy Woo, for instance, projected late last week that bitcoin was likely to hit so-called 'channel resistance' at $1,717. Should it break this level, Woo projected a bubble could form in the market, whereby the price had increased meaningfully beyond annual average user growth.  The development could place the wider cryptocurrency markets on uncertain ground, as analysts are already expressing concerns crypto assets have entered bubble territory.  Still, others pushed back that this applies to bitcoin, an asset seen as having more long-term utility and value.

42399835,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyscN,1494327611,US Audit Watchdog: DLT Could Disrupt Financial Reporting,"Technologies like blockchain are changing the face of auditing, according to a senior official of an oversight board created by the US Congress.  Speaking during an investor event in New York last week, Jeanette Franzel, a board member for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), said she believes distributed ledgers could bring both opportunities and problems for auditors, should financial firms adopt the tech in a significant way.  Franzel remarked:  ""These potentially disruptive changes will present challenges and threats across the auditing profession, including the need for significant investments in technology, new management and technical skills, and even new firm business and organizational models. Of course, these developments will present new corresponding risks to audit quality.""  Notably, Franzel isn't alone in this view.  FINRA, the self-regulatory agency for the brokerage industry (over which the PCAOB has authority), said in a report issued in January that blockchain could both reshape the work its members do as well as the standards it develops.  The ACCA, the world's biggest organization for certified accountants, too, has argued that the tech is redrawing the financial reporting landscape.  Such technological shifts are likely to impact not just the industry it oversees, but the PCAOB itself, according to Franzel.  ""The PCAOB's inspection approaches have been evolving and changing over the years in response to risks and trends, and the pace of these changes and the necessary evolution in our inspection approaches will likely accelerate drastically in the coming years,"" she said.  Established in 2002 with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the PCAOB aims to improve auditing standards and corporate disclosures. As part of that legislation, the PCAOB was set up as a non-profit entity devoted to policing auditors based in the US.

42399842,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbysiH,1494324035,The Blockchain Immutability Myth,"Dr Gideon Greenspan is the founder and CEO of Coin Sciences, the company behind the MultiChain platform for private blockchains.  In this opinion piece, Greenspan attacks the idea that true immutability can be achieved in blockchain systems, arguing a more relative definition of this feature better encapsulates what's the technology can achieve.  — Saint Augustine, De natura boni, i, 405 C.E. (with minor edits)    If you ask someone well-informed about the characteristics of blockchains, the word 'immutable' will invariably appear in the response.  In plain English, this word is used to denote something which can never be modified or changed. In a blockchain, it refers to the global log of transactions, which is created by a consensus between the chain's participants. The basic notion is this: once a blockchain transaction has received a sufficient level of validation, some cryptography ensures that it can never be replaced or reversed.  This marks blockchains as different from regular files or databases, in which information can be edited and deleted at will. Or so the theory goes.  In the raucous arena of blockchain debate, immutability has become a quasi-religious doctrine – a core belief that must not be shaken or questioned. And just like the doctrines in mainstream religions, members of opposing camps use immutability as a weapon of derision and ridicule.  The past year has witnessed two prominent examples:  For one, cryptocurrency advocates claim that immutability can only be achieved through decentralized economic mechanisms such as proof-of-work. From this perspective, private blockchains are laughable because they depend on the collective good behavior of a known group of validators, who clearly cannot be trusted.  Scorn has also been directed at the idea of an editable (or mutable) blockchain, in which retroactive modifications can be made to the transaction history under certain conditions. Mockers posed the question: ""What could possibly be the point of a blockchain if its contents can easily be changed?""  For those of us on the sidelines, it’s fun to watch the mudslinging. Not least because both of these criticisms are plain wrong. Both stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of immutability in blockchains (and indeed any computer system).  For those short on time, here’s the bottom line:  In blockchains, there is no such thing as perfect immutability. The real question is: What are the conditions under which a particular blockchain can and cannot be changed? And do those conditions match the problem we're trying to solve?  To put it another way, a blockchain's transactions are not written into the mind of God (with apologies to Augustine above). Instead, the chain's behavior depends on a network of corporeal computer systems, which will always be vulnerable to destruction or corruption. But, before we get into the details of how, let’s proceed by recapping some basics of blockchains themselves.  Blockchains in brief  A blockchain runs on a set of nodes, each of which may be under the control of a separate company, individual or organization. These nodes connect to each other in a dense peer-to-peer network, so that no one node acts as a central point of control or failure.  Each node can generate and digitally sign transactions which represent operations in some kind of ledger or database, and these transactions rapidly propagate to other nodes across the network in a gossip-like way.  Each node independently verifies every new incoming transaction for validity, in terms of: (a) its compliance with the blockchain's rules, (b) its digital signature and (c) any conflicts with previously seen transactions. If a transaction passes these tests, it enters that node's local list of provisional unconfirmed transactions (the 'memory pool'), and will be forwarded on to its peers.  Transactions that fail are rejected outright, while others whose evaluation depends on unseen transactions are placed in a temporary holding area (the 'orphan pool').  At periodic intervals, a new block is generated by one of the 'validator' nodes on the network, containing a set of as-yet unconfirmed transactions. Every block has a unique 32-byte identifier called a 'hash', which is determined entirely by the block's contents. Each block also includes a timestamp and a link to a previous block via its hash, creating a literal 'blockchain' going back to the very beginning.  Just like transactions, blocks propagate across the network in a peer-to-peer fashion and are independently verified by each node. To be accepted by a node, a block must contain a set of valid transactions which do not conflict with each other or with those in the previous blocks linked. If a block passes this and other tests, it is added to that node’s local copy of the blockchain, and the transactions within are 'confirmed'. Any transactions in the node’s memory pool or orphan pool which conflict with those in the new block are immediately discarded.  Every chain employs some sort of strategy to ensure that blocks are generated by a plurality of its participants. This ensures that no individual or small group of nodes can seize control of the blockchain’s contents.  Most public blockchains like bitcoin use 'proof-of-work' which allows blocks to be created by anyone on the internet who can solve a pointless and fiendishly difficult mathematical puzzle. By contrast, in private blockchains, blocks tend to be signed by one or more permitted validators, using an appropriate scheme to prevent minority control. (Our product MultiChain uses a technique called 'mining diversity' which requires a minimum proportion of the permitted validators to participate in order to create a valid chain.)  Depending on the consensus mechanism used, two different validator nodes might simultaneously generate conflicting blocks, both of which point to the same previous one. When such a 'fork' happens, different nodes in the network will see different blocks first, leading them to have different opinions about the chain's recent history.  These forks are automatically resolved by the blockchain software, with consensus regained once a new block arrives on one of the branches. Nodes that were on the shorter branch automatically rewind their last block and replay the two blocks on the longer one. If we're really unlucky and both branches are extended simultaneously, the conflict will be resolved after the third block on one branch, or the one after that, and so on. In practice, the probability of a fork persisting drops exponentially as its length increases. In private chains with a limited set of validators, the likelihood can be reduced to zero after a small number of blocks.  Nonetheless, it's important to remember that each node is running on a computer system owned and controlled by a particular person or organization, so the blockchain cannot force it to do anything. The purpose of the chain is to help honest nodes to stay in sync, but if enough of its participants choose to change the rules, no earthly power can stop them.  That’s why we need to stop asking whether a particular blockchain is truly and absolutely immutable, because the answer will always be no. Instead, we should consider the conditions under which a particular blockchain can be modified, and then check if we're comfortable with those conditions for the use case we have in mind.  Mutability in public chains  Let’s return to the two examples cited in the introduction, in which the doctrine of immutability has been used as a basis for ridicule.  We’ll begin with the claim that the consensual validation procedures used in permissioned blockchains cannot bring about the 'true immutability' promised by public chains.  This criticism is most easily addressed by pointing to the vulnerability of public blockchains themselves. Take, for example, the ethereum blockchain, which suffered a devastating exploit in June 2016. Someone found a coding loophole in a smart contract called The DAO, in which almost $250m had been invested, and began draining its funds at speed. While this clearly violated the intentions of the contract's creators and investors, its terms and conditions relied on the mantra that 'code is law'. Law or not, less than a month later, the ethereum software was updated to prevent the hacker from withdrawing the cryptocurrency 'earned'.  Of course, this update could not be enforced, since every ethereum user controls their own computer. Nonetheless, it was publicly supported by Vitalik Buterin, ethereum's creator, as well as many other community leaders. As a result, most users complied, and the blockchain with the new rules kept the name 'ethereum'.  A minority disagreed with the change and continued the blockchain according to its original rules, earning the title 'ethereum classic'. A more accurate choice of names might be 'ethereum compromised' and 'ethereum the pure'. Either way, democracy is democracy, and (the pragmatic and popular) 'ethereum' is now worth over 10x (the idealistic but sidelined) 'ethereum classic'.  Now, let's consider a less benevolent way in which public blockchain immutability can be undermined. Recall that block creation or 'mining' in bitcoin and ethereum uses a proof-of-work scheme, in which a mathematical problem must be solved in order to generate a block and claim its reward. The value of this reward inevitably turns mining into an arms race, with miners competing to solve the problems faster. To compensate, the network periodically adjusts the difficulty to maintain a constant rate of block creation, once every 10 minutes in bitcoin or 15 seconds in ethereum.  In the last five years, bitcoin’s difficulty has increased by a factor of 350,000 times. Today, the vast majority of bitcoin mining takes place on expensive specialized hardware, in locations where the weather is cold and electricity is cheap.  For example, $1,089 will buy you an Antminer S9, which mines blocks 10,000 times faster than any desktop computer and burns 10 times more electricity. This is all a long way from the democratic ideals with which bitcoin was created, even if it does make the blockchain extremely secure.  Well, kind of secure. If someone wanted to undermine the immutability of the bitcoin blockchain, here’s how they would do it. First, they would install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together, creating a so-called '51% attack'. Second, instead of openly participating in the mining process, they would mine their own 'secret branch', containing whichever transactions they approve and censoring the rest. Finally, when the desired amount of time had passed, they would anonymously broadcast their secret branch to the network.  Since the attacker has more mining power than the rest of the network, their branch will contain more proof-of-work than the public one. Every bitcoin node will therefore switch over, since the rules of bitcoin state that the more difficult branch wins. Any previously confirmed transactions not in the secret branch will be reversed, and the bitcoin they spent could be sent elsewhere.  By now, most bitcoin believers will be laughing, because I wrote ""install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together"" as if this is trivial to achieve. And they have a point, because of course it's not easy, otherwise lots of people would already have done it. You need a lot of mining equipment, and a lot of electricity to power it, both of which cost a ton of money. But here's the inconvenient fact that most bitcoiners brush over: for the government of any mid-size country, the money required is still small change.  Let's estimate the cost of a 51% attack which reverses a year of bitcoin transactions. At the current bitcoin price of $1,500 and reward of 15 bitcoins (including transaction fees) per 10-minute block, miners earn around $1.2bn per year ($1500 × 15 × 6 × 24 × 365). Assuming (reasonably) that they are not losing money overall, or at least not losing much, this means that total miner expenses must also be in the same range. (I’m simplifying here by amortizing the one-time cost of purchasing mining equipment, but $400m will buy you enough Antminer 9s to match the current bitcoin network’s mining capacity, so we're in the right ball park.)  Now, think about the reports that bitcoin is being used by Chinese citizens to circumvent their country’s capital controls. And consider further that the Chinese government’s tax revenues are approximately $3tn per year. Would a non-democratic country's government spend 0.04% of its budget to shut down a popular method for illegally taking money out of that country?  I wouldn’t claim that the answer is necessarily yes. But if you think the answer is definitely no, you're being more than a little naive. Especially considering that China reportedly employs 2 million people to police internet content, which totals $10bn/year if we assume a low wage of $5,000. That puts the $1.2bn cost of reversing a year of bitcoin transactions in perspective.  Even this analysis understates the problem, because the Chinese government could undermine the bitcoin network much more easily and cheaply. It appears that the majority of bitcoin mining takes place in China, due to low-cost hydroelectric power and other factors. Given a few tanks and platoons, China’s army could physically seize these bitcoin mining operations, and repurpose them to censor or reverse transactions. While the wider bitcoin world would undoubtedly notice, there's nothing it could do without fundamentally altering the governance structure (and therefore nature) of bitcoin itself. What was that about censorship free money?  None of this should be construed as a criticism of bitcoin's design, or a prediction that a network catastrophe will actually happen. The bitcoin blockchain is a remarkable piece of engineering, perhaps even perfect for the purpose its creator(s) had in mind. And if I had to put money on it, I would bet that China and other governments probably won't attack bitcoin in this way, because it's not in their ultimate interest to do so. More likely, they’ll focus their wrath on its more untraceable cousins like dash, zcash and monero.  Nonetheless, the mere possibility of this form of interference puts the cryptocurrency immutability doctrine in its place. The bitcoin blockchain and its ilk are not immutable in any perfect or absolute sense. Rather, they are immutable so long as nobody big enough and rich enough decides to destroy them. Still, by relying on the economic cost of subverting the network, cryptocurrency immutability satisfies the specific needs of people who don’t want to trust governments, companies and banks.  It may not be perfect, but it’s the best they can do.  Rewriteable private chains  Now let’s move on to private blockchains, designed for the needs of governments and large companies.  We can begin by noting that, from the perspective of these organizations, immutability based on proof-of-work is a commercial, legal and regulatory non-starter, because it allows any (sufficiently rich) actor to anonymously attack the network. For institutions, immutability can only be grounded in the good behavior of other similar institutions, with whom they can sign a contract and sue if need be.  As a bonus, private blockchains are far less costly to run, since blocks only need a simple digital signature from the nodes that approve them. So long as a majority of validator nodes are following the rules, the end result is stronger and cheaper immutability than any public cryptocurrency can offer.  Of course, immutability is still easy to undermine if all the participants in a chain decide to do so together. Let's imagine a private blockchain used by six hospitals to aggregate data on infections. A program in one hospital writes a large and erroneous data set to the chain, which is a source of inconvenience for the other participants. A few phone calls later, the IT departments of all the hospitals agree to 'rewind' their nodes back one hour, delete the problematic data, and then allow the chain to continue as if nothing happened.  If all the hospitals agree to do this, who's going to stop them? Indeed, apart from the staff involved, who will even know that it happened? (It should be noted that some consensus algorithms like PBFT don't provide an official mechanism for rollbacks, but this doesn't help with governance since nodes are still free to bypass the rules.)  Now, consider a case where most of a private blockchain's participants agree to rewind and remove some transaction, but a few withhold their consent. Since every organization’s node is under its ultimate control, nobody can force the minority to join the consensus. However, by sticking to their principles, these users will find themselves on a fork being ignored by everyone else.  Like the virtuous proponents of ethereum classic, their place in heaven may well be assured. But back here on earth, they will be excluded from the consensus process for which the chain was deployed, and might as well give up completely. The only practical application of transactions outside the consensus is to serve as evidence in a court of law.  With this in mind, let's talk about the second case in which the doctrine of blockchain immutability has been used to ridicule ideas.  Here, we're referring to Accenture’s idea of using a chameleon hash to enable a block buried deep in a chain to be easily replaced. The primary motivation, as described by David Treat, is to allow an old problematic transaction to be quickly and efficiently removed. Under the scheme, if a block substitution does occur, a 'scar' is left behind which all participants can see. (It should be noted that any later transactions that depend on the deleted one would need to be removed as well.)  It's hard to overstate how many people attacked this idea when it was announced. Twitter and LinkedIn were aghast and aflutter. And I'm not just talking about the crypto crowd, which takes sporting pleasure in mocking anything related to enterprise blockchains. The idea was broadly slammed by private blockchain advocates as well.  And yet, under the right conditions, the idea of allowing blockchains to be modified retroactively via chameleon hashes can make perfect sense. To understand why, we begin with a simple question: in this type of blockchain, who would actually have the power to replace old blocks? Clearly, it can't be any unidentified network participant, because that would render the chain ungovernable.  The answer is that a chameleon hash can only be used by those who hold its secret key. The key is required to enable a new version of a block, with different transactions, to be given the same chameleon hash as before. Of course, we probably don’t want centralized control in a blockchain, so we can make the scheme stronger by having multiple chameleon hashes per block, each of whose key is held by a different party. Or we might use secret sharing techniques to divide a single chameleon hash key between multiple parties. Either way, the chain can be configured so that a retroactive block substitution can only occur if a majority of key holders approve it. Is this starting to sound familiar?  Allow me to render the parallel more explicit. Let's say that we share control over chameleon hashes between those same validating nodes which are responsible for block creation. This means that an old block can only be replaced if a majority of validating nodes agree to do so. And yet, as we discussed earlier, any blockchain can already be retroactively modified by a majority of validating nodes, via the rewind and replay mechanism. So in terms of governance, chameleon hashes subject to a validator majority make no difference at all.  If so, why bother with them? The answer is: performance optimization, because chameleon hashes allow old blocks to be substituted in a chain far more efficiently than before. Imagine that we need to remove a transaction from the start of a blockchain that has been running for five years. Perhaps this is due to the European Union's right to be forgotten legislation, which allows individuals to have their personal data removed from companies’ records. Nodes can't just wipe the offending transaction from their disks, because that would change the corresponding block’s hash and break a link in the chain.  The next time the blockchain was scanned or shared, everything would fall apart.  To solve this problem without chameleon hashes, nodes would have to rewrite the early block without the problematic transaction, calculate the block's new hash, then change the hash embedded in the next block to match. But this would also affect the next block's own hash, which must be recalculated and updated in the subsequent block, and so on all the way along the chain.  While this mechanism is possible in principle, it could take hours or days to complete in a blockchain with millions of blocks and transactions. Even worse, while engaged in this process, a node may be incapable of processing new incoming network activity.  So chameleon hashes provide a far more computationally efficient way to achieve the same goal. If you imagine a bad transaction as a rock buried many miles underground, chameleon hashes can teleport the rock to the surface, instead of making us dig all the way down, retrieve the rock and fill in the hole.  Immutability is nuanced  By reviewing the risks of proof-of-work blockchains and the technical value of chameleon hashes, I hope to have convinced you that blockchain immutability is far more nuanced than a yes or no question.  To quote Simon Taylor quoting Ian Grigg, the question must always be: ""Who are you and what do you want to achieve?""  For cryptocurrency believers who want to avoid government-issued money and the traditional banking system, it makes perfect sense to believe in a public proof-of-work blockchain, whose immutability rests on economics rather than trusted parties. Even if they must live with the possibility of a large government (or other wealthy actor) bringing down the network, they can take solace in the fact that this would be a painful and expensive operation. And no doubt they hope that cryptocurrencies will only get more secure, as their value and mining capacity continues to grow.  On the other hand, for enterprises and other institutions that want to safely share a database across organizational boundaries, proof-of-work immutability makes no sense at all. Not only is it astoundingly expensive, but it allows any sufficiently motivated participant to anonymously seize control of the chain and censor or reverse transactions. What these users need is immutability grounded in the good behavior of a majority of identified validator nodes, backed by contracts and law.  Finally, for most permissioned blockchain use cases, we probably don’t want validator nodes to be able to easily and cheaply substitute old blocks in the chain. As Dave Birch said at the time, ""The way to correct a wrong debit is with a correct credit"", rather than pretending that the debit never took place.  Nonetheless, for those cases where we do need the extra flexibility, chameleon hashes help make blockchains a practical choice.

42399837,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyseL,1494320409,Bitcoin Hedge Fund: Scaling Resolution Could Double Price,"Despite bitcoin's recent all-time highs, the digital asset could see bigger price gains if its scaling debate ultimately resolves, at least according to one major hedge fund centered on the technology.  In an email to investors this week, Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), a Jersey-based investment vehicle that buys and sells bitcoin on behalf of investors, touched on ongoing developments in the digital currency markets, putting a special emphasis on developments in litecoin and how they relate to the larger bitcoin market.  In the note, the firm pointed to the acceptance of Segregated Witness – a technical upgrade originally developed for bitcoin – by the litecoin community as one major factor behind that market's upward movement. The integration of SegWit on litecoin is a notable given the reticence by bitcoin miners to accept the upgrade on technical and political grounds.  Yet, should this kind of implementation be repeated for bitcoin, GABI argued, markets could have a similar reaction.  The firm wrote:  ""Even though one can find no evidence whatsoever that there were scaling pressures in litecoin, this upgrade went ahead and if it is even slightly predictive of a path that can be taken in bitcoin, one that will at least show progress if not resolution, the price impact could be significant. A double up wouldn't be shocking.""  The hedge fund also highlighted the broad increases observed across most cryptocurrency markets of late, which have increasingly diversified away from bitcoin.  As reported last week, markets outside of bitcoin have seen major trade activity in recent days, pushing the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies above $50bn for the first time ever. Of that, bitcoin accounts for roughly $27bn, according to available data.  ""This is a stunning progression and speaks to the thesis we've held for some time that the cryptocurrency landscape would become increasingly diverse in response to user demand,"" GABI said.
