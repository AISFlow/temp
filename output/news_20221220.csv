The meme coin maintains its position as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies as its total holder count has now crossed 1.26 million. 10,000 New Shiba Inu Holders Added In a time when cryptocurrencies across the space are marking a decline in support, Shiba Inu has added over 10,000 new holders in the span of two weeks. This saw the total SHIB holders cross into the 1.26 million territory, marking more growth for the meme coin. In the last 24 hours alone, the number is up by 0.033%, according to data from Etherscan. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Balks As Dormant Whales Reactivate The meme coin also recently marked another milestone after it crossed more than 1.8 million watchlists on Coinmarketcap. The growth comes even as the price of the digital asset suffers multiple setbacks, drastically dragging down the profit margins for investors. Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, recently released the data for the most-watched cryptocurrencies on the platform, and Shiba Inu emerged in the top three; alongside market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum. SHIB price struggles at $0.000008 | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView.com Will SHIB Price Remain Stagnant? SHIB’s price has been quite unresponsive to all of the new milestones being hit. The holder base had been consistently climbing over the last two months but the price of SHIB has not reacted positively in any way. Instead, developments on Shiba Inu seem to be disconnected from the price performance of the native token. Related Reading: Binance Smart Chain User Activity Tanks, Why BNB Price Could Suffer With no meaningful movement following all of these, then it is possible that the meme coin will not be seeing any sort of recovery before the year runs out. It continues to trend just above $0.000008 as the bear market rages on. It is important to keep in mind that the total number of active Shiba Inu addresses currently sits below 5% of its total addresses. This means that there is a decreased activity for the digital asset, which could explain why there have been no positive reactions to the milestones. The cryptocurrency has also fallen out of favor with large Ethereum whales who no longer hold a significant amount of the cryptocurrency on their balances. This has accelerated the bear case for the meme coin. If momentum does not pick up, then it is possible that SHIB could see the lower side of $0.000007 before the year is over.

The fractal pattern developed following the most recent pullback, and appears to have a similar structure to a major bull market breakout. Could this be the light at the end of the tunnel for cryptocurrencies? Hawkish Fed Dims Litecoin Rally, But A Fractal Gives Hope After a stellar month leading the market with 40% returns for November, Litecoin has given back nearly half of that thus far in December. LTC had been on a tear, outperforming top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and clawed its way closer toward making it back into the top ten cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Explodes Around $18K Level, As Fed Reveals 50 Basis Point Rate Increase But the greater market pullback stemming from a hawkish Fed meeting this month, caused a failure to liftoff in Litecoin. However, the discovery of a price action fractal in LTCUSD could suggest this recent pullback wasn’t necessarily a failure, but a refueling of sorts — before taking off in an even stronger rally. The price action is strikingly similar then versus now | LTCUSD on TradingView.com Comparing Price Action Then Vs Now: Will Bulls Get A Break? The fractal begins on Black Thursday in March 2020 — a black swan event few saw coming. Litecoin rebounded and the fractal formed. Unlike Bitcoin, which made a lower low during the FTX, LTCUSD hasn’t, and instead has followed the same pattern from 2020 almost flawlessly. Price following the fractal further could lead to some minor continued downside, but ultimately holds at resistance turned support. If the current pullback proves to be a retest and holds, a more obvious rally could materialize. Related Reading: Litecoin Continues To Slide, Now Below Shiba Inu In Market Cap Failure would almost certainly send Litecoin back toward 2018 lows and potentially beyond, making the fractal among one of Litecoin bulls’ best hope for a redemption rally. Importantly, a concurrent reversal taking place in the LTCBTC and LTCETH trading pairs appear to indicate strength in the altcoin relative to the top two crypto assets. However, there is no telling what this might mean for the overall market at this time.

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  In a statement posted to Twitter, Auros said that the decision followed “the events that transpired around FTX,” the crypto exchange formerly helmed by Sam Bankman-Fried that imploded in November.  “The company found itself in a position where immediate liquidity was insufficient to satisfy recalls from lenders,” according to the statement. “Management and directors remained confident in the long-term prospects for the business.”  Auros said, ""Upon the successful implementation of the restructuring, it is anticipated that Auros’ operations would resume as normal.”  The firm had $20 million of funds frozen on FTX, according to the intelligence site OffShoreAlert, which cited a Nov. 16 court filing submitted to the British Virgin Islands High Court. The news was previously reported by The Block.  Auros encountered liquidity troubles after the sudden implosion of FTX. Multiple trading firms held a part of their funds on the exchange for trading purposes, and were subsequently hit when FTX halted withdrawals on Nov. 8 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11. Funds on the exchange are now tied up in a lengthy court proceeding.

CoinDesk Indices (CDI) data shows the Currency Select Index (CCYS), anchored by bitcoin (BTC), and the Smart Contract Platform Index (SCPX), anchored by ether (ETH), outperforming other select sectors within the CMI universe. CMI sectors represent comprehensive groupings of digital assets by sector, allowing for measurement of performance and a comparison.  What today’s data shows is that, similar to in past market cycles, flights to safety within the cryptosphere is translating to movement of capital into BTC and ETH, relative to other coins. On the other end of the spectrum, the more speculative Computing Index (CPU) and Culture & Entertainment (CNE) have lagged other sectors in both week to date and month to date performance.

42411694,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfFWC,1671568851,What Is 'Web5' and How Is it Different From Web3?,"The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls ""Web5""?  It turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.”  To land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 = 5.  Web5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.  Dorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.”  There are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.  So, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.  In doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5.  The other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.  TBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.  Will it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).  One of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | ETH | FIL | ENS,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-web5-and-how-is-it-different-from-web3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db855a0c942a439d599746e3a8711e52b4134fe4-576x347.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407226,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJs5w,1671566367,Crypto’s Responsibility to Law Enforcement in 2023 and Beyond,"Shortly after the ball dropped in Times Square on New Year's Eve welcoming in 2022, the cryptocurrency, blockchain and digital assets community rang in the new year with thoughts of mass adoption into the mainstream. Bitcoin was trading around $40,000, an iconic arena in Los Angeles had just changed its name to one of the major crypto exchanges, and celebrities, athletes and musicians were lining up to sing the praises of this new financial ecosystem.  Bill Callahan, a former special agent financial investigator with the U.S. Department of Justice, is the director of government and strategic affairs at the Blockchain Intelligence Group. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  It’s been a bumpy ride since then. Bitcoin is down 60%. Once-prominent crypto apps Celsius Network and BlockFi are sitting in bankruptcy court. And as we head into the new year, at least one stadium will have to scrub a crypto exchange’s name off its facade.  A year of exploitation and what comes next  Law enforcement, financial investigators and anti-money laundering examiners have had their hands full with digital asset-related scams, frauds, thefts and hacks this year. And we’re not just talking about stolen Bored Apes (though more than a few were phished). If we learned anything in 2022, it’s that blockchain analytics can help speed up an investigation – from the time law enforcement is first alerted to a potential financial crime to the time of arrest.  In March, my company, Blockchain Intelligence Group, uncovered potential suspicious activity involving a non-fungible token (NFT) project called Frosties and notified law enforcement authorities. Agents were able to track and trace financial transactions along the blockchain and along with other electronic data, were able to identify the culprits, arrest them and prevent another planned NFT fraud.  See also: Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions Season  What ordinarily would have taken months of painstaking financial investigative work was reduced to a matter of weeks. That’s important, considering the number and value of crypto exploits actually increased this year – despite the market pull back.  In 2023, the need for blockchain investigators (and analytics tools) will grow: from global regulatory agencies handling complex investigations of cyber-attacks and the cross-jurisdictional movement of money to local police agencies responding to citizen complaints of romance or investment scams.  Local police departments will no longer have the luxury to send these investigations to the feds but will dedicate resources to train and equip financial and economic crime detectives with the latest in cryptocurrency investigation education.  Education and prevention  In 2023, crypto service providers will need to learn more about the trans-national criminal organization (TCO) and drug trafficking organizations (DTO), to use the parlance of investigators. It’s every ecosystem participant’s duty to file suspicious activity reports and stay aware of potential crimes.  Just as during the rise of the modern drug cartel in 1980s and 1990s, specific players have emerged with new technologies to service and support bad actors. Crypto, with its unprecedented level of transparency, should make it difficult for dark flows of cash – though that doesn’t always happen.  Although crypto is verifiable, transnational criminal syndicates benefit from the censorship resistance of decentralized networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum (and maybe a handful of others) to consolidate their earnings from illicit activity.  See also: 10 Predictions About Crypto in 2023  Then there’s the rise of crime-as-a-service, such as providing a crypto for fiat or vice versa exchange, code and instructions to conduct a hack or a wallet service to collect crypto from a phishing scam. Actors have and will continue to emerge to segregate these duties from each other.  Blockchain analysis can help track flows from criminal activity, but it’s only part of a potential solution. Education on how to avoid being a victim of cryptocurrency fraud needs to increase in 2023. That will start with communities revolting against the proliferation of bitcoin ATM machines in places where you traditionally would not do your banking or investing (i.e., bars, gas stations and the back of a convenience store) – which have emerged as potential money laundering jukeboxes.  While the criminal element will continue their attacks, the cybersecurity industry will strengthen. Blockchain and cryptocurrency analytics will be incorporated into the response. The digital asset investigations space will continue to grow, tools to track and trace cryptocurrency scams and frauds will become more affordable and readily available to local police agencies and financial investigators will not just follow the money, they will follow the coins.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Bill Callahan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/20/cryptos-responsibility-to-law-enforcement-in-2023-and-beyond,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ddf2784aa3f651879f81c1fc36695f9583a65ae-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CoinDesk Indices (CDI) data shows the Currency Select Index (CCYS), anchored by bitcoin (BTC), and the Smart Contract Platform Index (SCPX), anchored by ether (ETH), outperforming other select sectors within the CMI universe.  CMI sectors represent comprehensive groupings of digital assets by sector, allowing for measurement of performance and a comparison.  What today’s data shows is that, similar to in past market cycles, flights to safety within the cryptosphere is translating to movement of capital into BTC and ETH, relative to other coins.  On the other end of the spectrum, the more speculative Computing Index (CPU) and Culture & Entertainment (CNE) have lagged other sectors in both week to date and month to date performance.  The rotation of capital from perceived risk to perceived safety in crypto markets is occurring in conjunction with similar flows within traditional finance.  Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG), a tool developed by Julius de Kempanaer, allows for assets to be tracked versus a selected benchmark. Assets are subsequently separated into four distinct quadrants.  Leading: High relative performance and momentum  Weakening: Strong relative performance and slowing momentum  Lagging: Weak relative performance and momentum  Improving: Weak relative performance but increasing momentum  We compared the following seven SPDR exchange-traded funds (ETF) using the S&P 500 as the benchmark.  XLE: Energy Select  XLY: Consumer Discretionary  XLF: Financials  XLV: Healthcare  XLU: Utilities  XLP: Consumer Staples  XLK: Technology  Defensive sectors such as consumer staples, health care and utilities lead the S&P 500 currently. The more speculative consumer discretionary and technology sectors are lagging and weakening versus the benchmark.  The similar behavior among investors in the two asset classes implies that everyone is choosing safety at the moment.  For those who prefer traditional equities, that translates to utilities, health care and consumer staples. For those who prefer traditional assets, the assets of choice are bitcoin and ether.  Interestingly, adding bitcoin and ether to the same RRG shows that they both fall into the leading quadrant as well.  This appears counterintuitive, as you would be hard-pressed to find someone who would place cryptocurrencies within the same risk bucket as health-care stocks.

42413411,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8ZcI,1671564524,"Crypto Trading Firm Auros, Hit by FTX Collapse, Discloses Provisional Liquidation","Auros Global, the troubled crypto trading firm and market maker, disclosed Tuesday that it was granted a “Provisional Liquidation” request last month from a court in the British Virgin Islands, as part of efforts to restructure outstanding debt to lenders.  In a statement posted to Twitter, Auros said that the decision followed “the events that transpired around FTX,” the crypto exchange formerly helmed by Sam Bankman-Fried that imploded in November.  “The company found itself in a position where immediate liquidity was insufficient to satisfy recalls from lenders,” according to the statement. “Management and directors remained confident in the long-term prospects for the business.”  Auros said that the court order allows for a “restructuring mechanism where the incumbent management is permitted to continue to trade in the capacity of ‘Authorized Managers,’ under the supervision of an external advisory firm, whilst a restructuring plan is being formulated.”  “Upon the successful implementation of the restructuring, it is anticipated that Auros’ operations would resume as normal,” Auros said.  The firm had $20 million of funds frozen on FTX, according to the intelligence site OffShoreAlert, which cited a Nov. 16 court filing submitted to the British Virgin Islands High Court. The news was previously reported by The Block.  According to OffshoreAlert, an intelligence site that monitors financial firms, Auros Global Ltd. submitted the request for provisional liquidation on Nov. 16.  The court granted the request on Nov. 23, Auros said.  Financial advisory firm Interpath Advisory acts as supervisor, per the Auros statement.  Auros encountered liquidity troubles after the sudden implosion of FTX. Multiple trading firms held a part of their funds on the exchange for trading purposes, and were subsequently hit when FTX halted withdrawals on Nov. 8 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11. Funds on the exchange are now tied up in a lengthy court proceeding.  Auros liquidity problems  The liquidity problems at Auros percolated to creditors on lending protocols because the embattled trading firm has some $20 million of outstanding loans from credit pools on Maple Finance and Clearpool.  The wider crypto community first learned about the struggles of Auros on Nov. 30, when M11 Credit tweeted about Auros missing payment on some $3 million loan from a credit pool citing “short-term liquidity problems.” M11 Credit, a subsidiary of investment firm Maven 11 Capital, is a lending pool manager on Maple.  Read more: Crypto Trader Auros Global Misses Payment on DeFi Loan as FTX Contagion Spreads  Before that, earlier in November, M11 Credit had extended maturity for two Auros loans for short terms without repayment.  To date, Auros missed payment on $17.7 million of loans from M11 Credit-managed USDC stablecoin and wrapped ether (wETH) credit pools on Maple.  M11 Credit has not issued a default notice on the loans as it is working towards a debt restructuring.  “We continue to believe at this time that we're on a path to a successful restructuring,” M11 Credit tweeted on Tuesday.  The Auros filing for provisional liquidation came as creditors were anxious about their money tied up in impacted credit pools.  Nexus Mutual, an insurance alternative for decentralized finance, is a large creditor of the wETH credit pool on Maple impacted by Auros loans, CoinDesk reported earlier. The same credit pool was also rocked by Orthogonal Trading’s default, which left Maple creditors facing losses on the $36 million of unpaid loans.

Proof of ownership, identity and authenticity are both valuable traits that are made possible by blockchain technology.  As of Dec 15, 2022, DTZ lost 23.5% for the quarter to date (QTD), and included four digital assets, all in the Digitization Industry and Industry Group according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). Three constituents remained in DTZ the entire fourth quarter and they all lost.  Best performer: Civic lost 19.7%. Civic Key has been around for years, and development continues with a focus on Web3 profiles.  Worst performer: Galxe lost 46.9%. It dropped over 40% in the days after the FTX collapse and hasn’t been able to recover since. Civic is roughly twice as big a Galxe by market cap, and together they make up over 28% of the sector.  Biggest asset: Ethereum Name Service, comprising 49.3% of the sector. ENS lost 19.7% but continues to grow, with new addresses constantly being registered.

Read more: CoinDesk Market Outlook: 4Q Crypto Gloom Spills Into 2023  Commentary and outlook  The digitization sector – including decentralized web infrastructure, along with proof of ownership and authentication via blockchain technology – wasn’t spared from the broad crypto market malaise.  “You just can't trust centralized intermediaries,” says Harrison Hines, co-founder and CEO of Web3 developer platform Fleek.  There’s more demand for naming services, according to Hines. The big opportunity is looking to build supporting projects like “blockchain name service aggregator” so that browsers know how to resolve the registry issue across various domains because “they're all part of this one registry.”  “I think there'll be multiple winners in the blockchain domain space,” he told CoinDesk in an interview.  Ethereum Name Service is one of the early adopters among the domain name system (DNS) players.  Despite the platform’s native ENS token trading down for the quarter amid the general market downturn, Hines said he is very bullish on the project and the outlook on the sector in 2023.  “We get to the point of, like, we don’t deal with someone's phone number anymore,” he said. “It's so hidden in the user experience.

Inclusion of a digital asset in CNE is subject to minimum trading and exchange eligibility requirements. CNE reflects the DACS as of the prior month, so the Culture & Entertainment sector includes all projects that aim to decentralize social media platforms, create decentralized gaming worlds and increase direct peer-to-peer interaction between content creators and their audience, while at the same time maintain user privacy, security and ownership of data and digital assets.  As of Dec 15, 2022, CNE lost 35.2% for the quarter to date, and included 25 digital assets assigned to six industries in three industry groups according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). Twenty-three constituents remained in CNE the entire fourth quarter and they all lost.  Best performer: Adventure Gold, the native token of the NFT project Loot, lost 10.4% and is part of the DACS Gaming Industry assigned to the Metaverse Industry Group. It has leaned heavily on its non-fungible tokens (NFT) being free to use however folks please. As such, any new project looking to incorporate Loot tends to have a positive effect on the price of AGLD. This time it would appear to be a game called Endless Crawler.  Worst performer: Rally (RLY), the token of the social tokens platform, lost 53% and is part of the DACS Social Industry assigned to the Media Industry Group. It dropped over 30% in the days after the FTX collapse and hasn’t been able to recover since. However, both Adventure Gold and Rally are relatively small, with a combined total weight just over 0.8% of CNE at the end of the period.  Biggest asset: ApeCoin is the biggest asset in CNE, comprising 21.4% of the sector. While APE lost 26.0% QTD, it ranked as the fifth-best performing asset in the sector. It has fluctuated wildly this quarter, swinging to new lows on the back of reports of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe in October, and then rebounding considerably on the launch of its staking service in mid-December.  Also notable: Virtual reality and gaming platform Decentraland’s MANA token was down 46%.

CPU reflects the DACS as of the prior month, so the Computing sector consists of projects that aim to decentralize the sharing, storing and transmission of data by removing intermediaries and ensuring privacy for all users. All projects that aim to gather, transmit, store and share data and web services in a decentralized manner play a key factor in building the infrastructure of Web3. This includes on-chain and off-chain data transmission, social data platforms, peer-to-peer secure data transactions, open networks, free market private computation, and decentralized file storage and file sharing.  As of Dec 15, 2022, CPU lost 20.9% for the quarter to date (QTD), and included 23 digital assets assigned to five single industry or industry groups according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). Twenty constituents remained in CPU the entire fourth quarter, with 15, or 75%, losing and five, or 25%, gaining.  Best performer: Mask Network, a protocol that allows users to send encrypted messages over Twitter, gained 151.2%, and is part of the DACS Shared Storage Industry and Industry Group. The social media integration protocol was seemingly catalyzed by Elon Musk’s statements in late October regarding his goals for Twitter and advertising and speculation that Twitter's pivot to Web3 might directly benefit the Mask Network.  Worst performer: JasmyCoin, the token of a platform that develops internet of things (IoT), lost 44.1% and is part of the DACS IoT Industry and Industry Group. However, these best and worst assets are relatively small, with a combined total weight less than 2.8% of CPU at the end of the period.  Biggest asset: Chainlink, comprising 42.7% of the sector.

Read more: CoinDesk Market Outlook: 4Q Crypto Gloom Spills Into 2023  Commentary and outlook  The Computing sector suffered some of the same doubts applied to centralized entities in the wake of FTX collapse, raising the question of how to decentralize both front- and back-end systems, or both web-hosting services and cloud services, according to Ganesh Swami, co-founder and CEO of blockchain data organization Covalent.  “The industry is still so nascent that the reliance on the centralized, incumbent systems for the infrastructure is still very much an issue for a number of blockchain ecosystems,” Swami told CoinDesk.  Such reliance presents problems in terms of “exposing their networks to single points of failure,” he added.

42411044,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBDzP,1671563431,4th Quarter Market Outlook: The CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF),"The CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF) is designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of computing protocols that are included in Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). Inclusion of a digital asset in CDF is subject to minimum trading and exchange eligibility requirements. DCF reflects the DACS as of the prior month, so the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector refers to digital assets that support financial products and services that are not facilitated or controlled by any central entity. These financial products and services are accessible without any barrier to entry or identification requirements. All DeFi tokens must be created on smart contract platforms and offer open-sourced liquidity with the ability for token holders to reserve governance rights.  If there was one crypto sector that had both winners and losers from the FTX debacle, it was decentralized finance (DeFi). As worries grew about the stability and future of centralized exchanges (CEX), tokens associated with decentralized exchanges (DEX) soared.  The industry contracted, and some large decentralized lending platforms took big hits from loan defaults. Total value locked (TVL) in the DeFi sector – a key barometer of overall interest – lost around 22% in value during the quarter, to $41 billion, data from DeFiLlama shows.  As of Dec 15, 2022, DCF lost 18.2% for the quarter to date (QTD), and included 45 digital assets assigned to 12 industries in seven industry groups according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). Fully 38 constituents remained in DCF the entire fourth quarter with 31 or 81.6% losing and 7, or 18.4%, gaining.  Best performer: dYdX (DYDX), gained 30% and is part of the DACS CLOB Industry assigned to the Exchanges Industry Group. The advanced decentralized exchange appeared to have been one of the few protocols to benefit from the FTX fiasco, as CEX trust eroded and funds were seen to be heavily moved back on-chain.  Worst performer: Maple lost 79%, and is part of the DACS Lending/Borrowing Industry assigned to the Credit Platform Industry Group. The largest unsecured crypto lending platform has been grappling with a $54 million debt crisis while gearing up for a major system upgrade. As CoinDesk recently reported, Maple Finance was badly affected by the FTX collapse as borrowers were forced to default on their loans. Unlike traditional collateralized DeFi credit platforms that have a built-in auto-liquidation function to protect the protocol, Maple relies on a centralized group of individuals to approve uncollateralized loans. However, both dYdX and Maple are relatively small, with a combined total weight just over 1.0% of DCF at the end of the period.  Other notable winners: Aragon (ANT), which supports decentralized autonomous organizations, gained 27%.  Biggest asset: Uniswap, comprising 37.3% of the sector. While UNI lost 9% QTD, it ranked as the 10th best performing asset in the sector. According to DefiLlama, TVL across DeFi protocols is down 22% on the quarter, to just over $40 billion, the lowest since March of 2021, and down from a high of nearly $200 billion almost exactly a year ago.  Read more: CoinDesk Market Outlook: 4Q Crypto Gloom Spills Into 2023  Commentary and outlook  Despite the downturn, the DeFi’s options space likely will grow in the long run as the benefits of transparency and not needing custody become clearer, according to Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata.  “We've seen an appetite for passive yield” throughout 2022, Magadini told CoinDesk in an interview. “This created the emergence of DOV, or DeFi options vaults, to create strategies of selling cover calls or cash-secured puts.”  In 2023, Magadini said, protocols using an order book model – meaning participants wait to have their limit orders fulfilled – rather than an automated market maker (AMM) that process all transactions automatically might face challenges as they face direct competition against centralized finance (CeFi), which “has a better mousetrap.”  Crypto-focused asset manager Hashdex said in a 2023 outlook report that blue chip DeFi protocols with strong revenue – such as Aave, Compound and Uniswap – will get stronger on the back of their well-designed tokenomics as they “seek out new business models.” That includes Uniswap and its “fee switch” initiative,” according to the report.

Inclusion of a digital asset in SMT is subject to minimum trading and exchange eligibility requirements. SMT reflects the DACS as of the prior month, so the Smart Contract Platform sector includes smart contracts that are computerized blockchain protocols that execute terms of a contract.  Smart Contracts represent computer code that ensures when the terms of the contract are met by both parties. It executes automatically, allowing for peer-to-peer trustless transactions. Smart contract platforms are designed for the building of decentralized applications, layer 2 scaling systems, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and custom protocols. Each platform has a unique open-source user and miner incentive structure and utilizes a BFT consensus mechanism. Each platform utilizes a native token for the payment towards building on the platform, providing liquidity and allowing interoperability between the native token and newly created tokens built on the platform.  As of Dec 15, 2022, SMT lost 13.1% for the quarter to date (QTD), and included 41 digital assets assigned to two single industry, industry groups, Multi-Chain/Parachain and Single Chain according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS)[1].  36 constituents remained in SMT the entire fourth quarter, with 33, or 91.7%, losing and three, or 8.3%, gaining.  Best performer: Optimism gained 17% and is part of the DACS Single Chain Industry and Industry Group. It surged over 100% in the days prior to the FTX collapse but took a big subsequent hit afterwards.  Worst performer: Solana lost 58% and is also part of the DACS Single Chain Industry and Industry Group. However, both Solana and Optimism are relatively small, with a combined total weight just over 2.5% of SMT at the end of the period.  Biggest asset: Ether, comprising 73% of the sector. It also covers 25% of the CMI, making it the second-largest asset by market value behind bitcoin. While ETH lost 5.5% QTD, it ranked as the fourth-best performing asset in the sector. Many viewed ether, the token of Ethereum, the largest smart contract platform that serves as the basis for most decentralized finance (DeFi) applications as valuable despite the greater crypto collapse. Given the volatility in the space, it is remarkable how the price of ETH remains relatively unchanged three months after the Merge.  Read more: CoinDesk Market Outlook: 4Q Crypto Gloom Spills Into 2023  Commentary and outlook  The smart contract platform sector had a mixed quarter:  The Ethereum scaling solution Optimism was a big winner, as was Polygon’s MATIC which gained 13% after multiple non-fungible token (NFT) partnership announcements with traditional companies such as Starbucks and Instagram. The FTM token from Fantom, one of the “Ethereum killer” smart-contract platforms, was up 2%.  On the losing side, Solana got crushed partly due to its close ties to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried Near Protocol (NEAR) was down 55%, and Waves (WAVES) lost 54%.  While Solana has been grappling with losses from the FTX storm since November, core projects are migrating into the Ethereum sphere. For instance, Solana-centric crypto wallet Phantom is expanding its support to Ethereum and Polygon – which plays into “a positive narrative” of layer 2 scaling, according to Nick Hotz, vice president of research at the digital-asset management firm Arca.  ""It has definitely been a story of the Ethereum ecosystem kind of taking market share over the last couple of months,” Hotz told CoinDesk in an interview.  Looking ahead to 2023, the market still needs to ""come to grips"" with the fact that staked ether withdrawals will be enabled around March, Hotz said.  ""I think a lot of people initially are going to read that as bearish just because people are spooked and that leads to potential selling pressure,"" he said. ""I certainly would be more interested in staking if I had very strong clarity around when I could get access to that liquidity than if I am uncertain.”  [1] As of Dec. 15, 2022, the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) was updated, and there is a structure modification to the industry groups and industries in the Smart Contract Platform sector.

CCX reflects the DACS as of the prior month, so the Currency sector refers to any digital asset acting primarily as a medium of exchange and unit of account running on a blockchain network with the ability to complete cross-border transactions without restriction. Digital assets in the Currency sector do not necessarily act as a store of value[1].  As of Dec 15, 2022, CCX lost 10.3% for the quarter to date (QTD), and included 25 digital assets assigned to seven industries in three industry groups according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS).  24 constituents remained in CCX the entire fourth quarter, with 21, or 87.5%, losing and three, or 12.5%, gaining.  Best performer: Dogecoin gained 42% and is part of the DACS Transparent DeFi Currency Industry assigned to the Transparent Industry Group. The meme coin had a massive surge shortly after Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover in late October, and continued to outperform over the quarter on (unsubstantiated) speculation that it might become the official cryptocurrency of Twitter.  Worst performer: Chain lost 57.6% and is part of the BaaS (Other) Industry assigned to the BaaS Industry Group. (NOTE: Both the best and worst performers are relatively small, with a combined total weight just under 3.1% of CCX at the end of the period.  Biggest asset: Bitcoin, comprising 86.5% of the sector. While it lost 11% QTD, it ranked as the 6th best performing asset in the sector. Many viewed bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency and the largest, as a source of stability amidst the chaos during the latter part of the quarter. According to The Block, bitcoin’s on-chain volume is down significantly, from $6 billion daily at the start of the quarter to $3 billion daily. Bitcoin blockchain network difficulty remains near all-time highs, however, and consequently miner revenue per terahash per second has continued its year-long downtrend, from 8 U.S. cents to 6 cents in this quarter.  Read more: CoinDesk Market Outlook: 4Q Crypto Gloom Spills Into 2023  Commentary and outlook  The Currency Sector’s fourth quarter filled investors with thrills and worries alike: On-again, off-again tokens such as dogecoin (DOGE) and litecoin (LTC) performed well, even as bellwether bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, faced multiple threats.  Bitcoin (BTC) was down 11% for the quarter as traders felt the continuing nervousness over the market uncertainty thanks to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance.  “The probability of a recession is high,” crypto trader Thomas Kralow said in an emailed comment. “People lose their jobs, the Fed pivots too late and we will see the same situation that played out back in 2008. When the Fed pivoted there was a relief rally for S&P 500, but as the interest rates finally started going down the market crashed another 40%.”  Kralow pointed out that the markets bottomed when the fed funds rate was basically at zero, adding: “This doesn’t bode well for bitcoin in 2023, and we could potentially see its price fall to $10,000 or even lower next year.”  [1] As of Dec. 15, 2022, the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) was updated, and the definition of “currency” changed.

Andrew Thurman told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that although the exchange has published that it holds $55 billion in customer deposits on-chain, “aside from that, we don’t have much on-chain or any kind of financial access or transparency into their entities.”  Binance has come under the media microscope after a large sum of funds, amounting to roughly $6 billion, moved out of the exchange last week during a 24-hour period. Jump Trading, a prominent trading firm in the ecosystem, was among the largest entities that moved funds out of Binance, according to Nansen’s analysis.  Read more: Binance.US Agrees to Buy Voyager's Assets for $1.02B  Thurman said it may have been a way for Jump Trading to redeem its BUSD, which is issued by Paxos, an exchange licensed by the New York State Department of Financial Services.  Still, Thurman said, despite Binance being one of the first exchanges to issue a proof of reserves, via a report that has since been removed by its auditor Mazars, on top of being well-capitalized after the collapse of FTX it is difficult to pinpoint the exchange’s financial health. “In short, you can’t” tell whether users can see the exchange’s liabilities against its supposed $55 billion in assets, Thurman said.  “Proof of reserves doesn’t give you the full picture. It’s not a full audit,” Thurman said.  Whether BNB, Binance’s native token, could face the same fate as FTT, the native token of bankrupt exchange FTX, is still unclear, Thurman said. “You would have to see somewhere around $12 billion in net outflows for [Binance] to be stressed the same way FTX was prior to them halting withdrawals,” Thurman said.  Read more: Boris Johnson's Brother Quits as Binance Adviser  What is evident is that “BNB is very popular on-chain,” Thurman said, and that “there’s real activity there.” However, “We have no idea what the liabilities are on Binance’s side or how BNB plays into that,” Thurman said. He said that what is known is that at least $18 billion of the $55 billion in reserves is stowed away at Paxos.  “We know there’s at least $18 billion in real dollars there, even if you discount the value of all the various digital assets in aggregate that Binance has,” Thurman said.  Thurman is relatively unconcerned about reports of flows between Binance and its American subsidiary.  “In my personal view, some of these transfers between Binance and Binance.US, the noise around them might be a little bit overblown,” Thurman said. “Transfers between exchanges are not uncommon, particularly when it's a market maker moving large sums of stablecoins.”  CoinDesk reached out for comment from Binance but did not hear back by the time of publication.",NEGATIVE,BNB | FTT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | FTT,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/20/nansen-analyst-on-chain-data-shows-binances-financials-are-a-black-box,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/281026d80ccf6254f8b103c5bbbfa461c9d29059-5786x3857.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407219,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJkje,1671563048,CoinDesk Market Outlook: 4Q Crypto Gloom Spills Into 2023,"As if 2022 weren’t already brutal enough on crypto investors, the fourth quarter brought an ugly coda with the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange – triggering another leg down in prices, spurring a fresh bout of contagion and enshrining the year as one of the worst ever in the digital-asset industry’s history.  The CoinDesk Market Ex Stablecoin Index (CMIX), a broad benchmark encompassing 163 digital assets, fell 12% from September through Dec. 15, and the gloom is hard to shake off as analysts turn their sights to 2023.  The CoinDesk Market Ex Stablecoin Index (CMIX): CMIX is a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of constituents in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) excluding stablecoins. Inclusion of a digital asset in CMIX is subject to minimum trading and exchange eligibility requirements.  The crypto industry’s self-inflicted wounds – U.S. prosecutors and regulators this month accused Bankman-Fried of orchestrating a $8 billion scheme to defraud investors – came as the Federal Reserve kept ratcheting monetary conditions ever tighter to bring down soaring inflation, adding stiff downward pressure on prices for cryptocurrencies and other risky assets.  Last year’s price run-up in the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), to a record $69,000 brought rampant speculation and risk-taking by crypto traders who used “leverage,” or borrowed money, to amplify their bets. The unwinding of that leverage over the course of 2022 served to accelerate the market’s descent. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index has tumbled 65% this year to about $16,594 at the time of writing.  ""It kind of almost got out of hand, and in a lot of ways it did get out of hand,” said Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata. “Now we're getting a recalibration of excess leverage. We're also getting consequences for people who've kind of taken advantage of that opportunity.”  Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest by market cap, slid 5.5% in the quarter through Dec. 15, and it’s down 68% in 2022, its worst performance since the crypto winter of 2018. The broad downward market pressures and a dropoff in activity outweighed any pickup in sentiment that came from the blockchain’s successful upgrade this year – the “Merge” – to a more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” network from a “proof-of-work” system similar to Bitcoin’s. More recently, speculation has mounted that the change might make ether more prone to regulation as a security under U.S. regulations.  Coming into the fourth quarter, crypto traders and analysts were speculating whether markets might be starting to heal from the steep losses earlier in the year inflicted by the collapse of Terra and the knock-on casualties of crypto financial firms Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and Three Arrows Capital.  The epic unraveling of FTX – initiated by an exclusive CoinDesk report that the Alameda Research trading firm’s balance sheet was dependent on sister company FTX’s in-house utility token, FTT – soon dashed the optimism.  FTT was, unsurprisingly, one of the biggest losers in digital-asset markets, plunging about 95% just in the fourth quarter alone. (The FTT token wasn’t part of the CoinDesk Market Index because it didn’t meet the key requirement of being listed for at least 30 days on at least two eligible exchanges. It was only listed on one.)  Among the biggest losers in the CMIX from the FTX fallout was the Solana blockchain’s SOL token, the largest among a handful of so-called “Sam Coins” that had been championed by Bankman-Fried. The SOL price tanked 58% during the quarter.  The contagion spread to Maple Finance, a decentralized lending platform that suffered some $54 million of loan defaults, some of them linked indirectly to the FTX failure. Maple’s MPL token was the quarter’s single biggest loser in the CMIX, diving 78%.  A few winners worth mentioning: Dogecoin (DOGE) rallied 42% for the quarter to date (QTD). The meme coin doubled in October following Elon Musk’s dramatic $44 billion takeover of Twitter. (By the end of the quarter it was looking a bit dog-tired, shaving some of those returns.) Litecoin (LTC) jumped 35% in the quarter, with its third mining-reward halving approaching in 2023; the scheduled blockchain event will cut LTC's pace of supply expansion by 50%.  Recent signs have emerged in digital-asset markets that the FTX turmoil may have passed.  Whether that translates to a market turnaround in 2023 might depend, to a certain extent, on the direction of U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy. Bitcoin’s overall price direction is still closely linked to the trajectory of traditional markets, and the largest cryptocurrency by market value often sets the course for broader digital-assets markets.  Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at the crypto asset manager Bitwise, says the digital-asset markets are entering a “period of indifference.”  “If you look back at other previous bear markets, they go through this classic style of people not believing it’s happening, and people being angered that there’s a period of capitulation. And [people say the] worst, and crypto is dead,” Hougan said. “We’re going to have to go through a period of six months where no one outside of the crypto industry cares about crypto.”  He added: “That’s sort of what leads into the next bull market that’s happened each time in the past, and I see no reason to believe that this time will be different.”  As of Dec 15, 2022, CMIX lost 12% QTD, and included 163 digital assets assigned to 33 industries in 21 industry groups in six sectors according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS).  144 constituents remained in CMIX the entire fourth quarter, with 126, or 88%, losing and 18, or 13%, gaining.  Best performer: Mask Network gained 151% and is part of the DACS Shared Storage industry in the Computing sector.  Worst performer: Maple lost 78% and is part of the DACS Lending/Borrowing Industry assigned to the Credit Platform Industry Group in the DeFi Sector. (NOTE: Both the best and worst performers are relatively small, with a combined total weight less than 0.05% of CMI at the end of the period.)  Biggest sector: CoinDesk Currency Ex Stablecoin Index (CCX), comprising 62% of CMIX.  Best-performing sector: CoinDesk Currency Ex Stablecoin Index (CCX), the only sector to outperform CMIX, despite its loss of 10%. This was mainly driven by bitcoin, which lost 11% and is the largest asset in its sector at roughly 87%. Bitcoin is also the largest asset in CMIX, covering 53%.  Worst-performing sector: CoinDesk Culture & Entertainment Index (CNE), losing 35%, mainly driven by its Metaverse Industry Group, which makes up more than two-thirds of the sector.

The company's new management, which took over when FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned Nov. 11, told a procedural hearing on Tuesday that it had over $1 billion in assets identified. The company located about $720 million in cash assets, which the exchange has yet to consolidate, in U.S. financial institutions authorized to hold funds by the U.S. Department of Justice. Another near $500 million is already being held in U.S. institutions.  “We are reaching out to all of those banks and changing the signatories on the accounts so that we can get access to the accounts and move the cash as much as we can to authorized depository institutions,” FTX’s new chief financial officer, Mary Cilia, speaking under oath, said during part of bankruptcy proceedings.  Around $130 million of cash is locked up in Japan, Cilia said – where local regulations have largely ringfenced funds for local customers.  Another $6 million is being kept for operational expenses such as payroll, and most of the remaining $423 million at unauthorized U.S. institutions are mainly at a single broker, she added, though she declined to identify the broker. $485 million are already in an authorized deposit institution, Cilia said.  There are “ongoing efforts” to identify the company’s international crypto assets and shift them to cold wallets, using custodial providers such as Bitgo, Steve Coverick, a senior director at FTX’s financial advisors Alvarez & Marsal told the hearing.  The Chapter 11 bankruptcy hearings aim to wind up the exchange, but have been complicated by supposedly weak governance and poor record keeping under Bankman-Fried’s reign. The company’s new management were having to review customer terms and conditions that were stored in a variety of places such as Google Drive and Slack, Coverick said.  The company has still not filed a statement of assets or of its financial position required under U.S. bankruptcy law, and currently estimates it will be able to do so in April, Cilia said. The company is still trying to sort out how many employees it has worldwide – Cilia estimated the figure at 220 – and how much was withdrawn leading up to the bankruptcy.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/20/ftx-has-over-1b-in-cash-creditor-meeting-told,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0aa18729da836071c0b7e75be415ce1917b7247-5807x3871.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The digital asset which had seen returns higher than 1,000% during the 2021 bull run would eventually see almost the entirety of those gains wiped out. Despite this, it had been able to maintain above a critical point for a long time. However, the cryptocurrency has now lost its footing, leading to an incredibly bearish outlook for the asset. ADA Price Falls Below $0.3 For a digital asset such as ADA, maintaining above $0.3 was important for it at a time when assets in the space needed to hold on to their critical support levels. Most of Cardano’s investors had thrown their hat in the ring to hold the bears off at $0.3, something they succeeded at until the FTX collapse happened. Related Reading: Binance Smart Chain User Activity Tanks, Why BNB Price Could Suffer Since the contagion had continued to spread across the space, ADA was, as expected, caught in the crossfire. Last week, it had eventually given way to the bears which had then dragged it down below $.30 for the second time in two months. However, this time around, there was no recovery to save the digital asset and it would continue to spiral down. It has now lost more than 14% of its value in the space of a week and is down by almost $0.050 in the same time frame. ADA drops to $0.25 | Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com Will Cardano Survive? Although Cardano’s current price path follows the general market price action, it is still far below most of the market in this regard. It is trading well below its 100-day moving average of $0.4 which puts it on a more bearish path compared to the rest of the market. Add in the constant negativity spewed at the digital asset on social media and it is a recipe for disaster. ADA falls below 100-day MA | Source: Barchart It is also possible that the market bottom has not been established yet. If this is to be believed and bitcoin were to drop to $12,000, or as low as $10,000 as predicted by some in the space, then it could mean that ADA holders will record more decline in the value of their holdings. If the market were to decline another 30%, then ADA price could drop as low as $0.10 before the next bull rally begins. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Balks As Dormant Whales Reactivate Nevertheless, the Cardano community holds on to its bullish forecast for the cryptocurrency. According to Price Estimates on Coinmarketcap, there is an expected 84% growth for ADA by the end of 2022 and the projections get higher over a longer timeframe into January 2023. If the estimates come to pass, then ADA could be seeing prices of $0.5 in January. ADA is changing hands at a price of $0.25 at the time of this writing.

42388278,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRCVlf,1671557274,Machankura’s Bitcoin Wallet Targets Africans With Old-School Phones and No Internet,"Bitcoiners in Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa, Kenya and five other African countries can now send and receive bitcoin (BTC) without a smartphone or Internet connection. Just a basic feature phone and text code will suffice, thanks to a digital wallet from a company called Machankura.  Despite the global smartphone revolution, mid-2000s-style phones with more limited functionality remain extremely popular in Africa. Machankura – a word that’s South African township slang meaning ""money"" – has popped up to serve that base of devices and satisfy the desire among many on the continent to use bitcoin as a currency for transactions.  The technological challenge is high, of course. No internet connection and low-horsepower phones mean boiling down the money exchange to essentially sending something like texts. Machankura says it works, and taps into Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, which facilities faster and cheaper transactions.  “I started Machankura to make bitcoin more accessible in communities, where not everyone has an Internet-connected device,” Kgothatso Ngako, South African computer science researcher and developer turned entrepreneur, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Anyone who's interested in using bitcoin and living on bitcoin should be able to do so easily.”  Read more: South African Non-Profit Bitcoin Ekasi Opens Education Center  Mobile money  Unlike other places where bitcoin acts more like digital gold – or something to hoard as an investment or speculative instrument – several communities in South Africa, like Bitcoin Ekasi, use bitcoin as they would a traditional currency. But exactly how do they do that without an iPhone or other smartphone?  That’s where “mobile money” comes in. That doesn’t just involve cryptocurrencies. It’s any service that lets people conduct financial transactions through their phone, without the need for a traditional bank account. According to the World Bank, about a third of adults in sub-Saharan Africa have a mobile money account – showing a large audience of receptive potential customers for Machankura.  Mobile money involves a communications protocol called Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), which is similar to the more widely known texting protocol called Short Message Service (SMS).  “In Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, if it's a digital payment, there's a [good] chance that it's a mobile money payment instead of a card,” Ngako explains.  Read more: Crypto Is Quietly Thriving in Sub-Saharan Africa: Chainalysis Report  How Manchankura works  To send bitcoin with Machankura, first-time users simply dial a country code like “*920*8333#” for Ghana or “*483*8333#” for Kenya. This brings up a registration menu that requests a five-digit PIN.  After registering, a subsequent menu offers additional functionality like sending or receiving bitcoin and viewing transaction history (users press the number on their feature phone corresponding to the desired menu option).  If a customer chooses to send or receive bitcoin, Machankura has integrated one crucial feature that significantly improves the user experience – personalized Lightning addresses.  “On the feature phone keypad, the user has to be able to input a Lightning address,” Ngako explains.  Instead of regular Lightning invoice addresses that can be over 200 alphanumeric characters long – well over the 182 USSD character limit – these personalized addresses are the length of a typical email handle. This makes them much easier to type out on feature phones with multi-press text entry (where each digit represents multiple letters).  Machankura’s default Lightning address combines a user’s phone number and Machankura’s “@8333.mobi” domain (e.g., 123456789@8333.mobi). Users can also modify these addresses to conceal their phone numbers (e.g., johndoe@8333.mobi).  Once a user has a few sats in the wallet (1 bitcoin is comprised of 100 million satoshis, or “sats”), integrations with gift card and voucher services like Bitrefill and Azteco make it possible to spend those sats on everyday purchases or redeem vouchers for bitcoin.  “I went to my grandmother's village in Mpumalanga, and over an hour-long walk, in seven out of eight stores, I was able to redeem my voucher,” Ngako says.  If Machankura sounds too good to be true, remember that it’s a custodial wallet, meaning users don’t control their own bitcoin and must trust the company. This also explains how users can send and receive bitcoin with no Internet connection – Machankura does it for them behind the scenes (by running Internet-connected Bitcoin and Lightning nodes on the back end).  There’s no “free lunch,” so some of those behind-the-scenes costs are passed on to users. Specifically, sending bitcoin will incur a 1% transaction fee, which is Machankura’s revenue source.  Despite the fees and the custodial model, Ngako’s efforts have garnered glowing reviews from prominent Bitcoiners including Elizabeth Stark, CEO and co-founder of Lightning infrastructure firm Lightning Labs.  Ngako is hoping to raise capital and eventually establish Machankura in all 54 African countries over the next few years.  “It's been self-funded to this point,” Ngako said. “And, now, I'm in the process of raising capital, so I'll see how that goes.”  CORRECTION (Dec. 20, 2022, 20:58 UTC): Corrects spelling of village’s name to Mpumalanga.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/20/machankuras-bitcoin-wallet-targets-africans-with-old-school-phones-and-no-internet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c06126af97bb779e9399204f8c1e83bec852d26c-7000x4440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Continuing declines for the stock have driven Coinbase’s market cap to less than $8 billion versus roughly $10 billion for meme favorite dogecoin (DOGE), which has suffered its own major tumble in 2022.  Though up marginally on the session at press time, COIN earlier dipped to as low as $34.35, with this recent decline adding to a 21% drop in November. Shares are down just shy of 86% year to date and off 91% from their all-time high hit shortly after going public in April 2021.  “Crypto traders remain skeptical about holding their cryptos on exchanges,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange Oanda. “Coinbase has an uphill battle as many traders fixate over moving their cryptos to cold storage, as surging yields keep pressure on this space, and over an uncertain regulatory path,” he added.  The bear market combined with recent scrutiny amid the collapse and potential fraudulent activities of crypto exchange FTX has led to significant declines in trading volumes – through which Coinbase generates much of its revenue. The movement of tokens to cold storage could exacerbate this trend as investors are less likely to transact as frequently if their coins are not on exchanges.  Online stock trading platform Robinhood (HOOD), for example, last month reported an 80% decline in crypto trading volume.  “The fact that dogecoin has a higher market cap than Coinbase shows you that there is still something wrong with the cryptoverse,” Moya said. While Coinbase may be “a decent long-term way to be on crypto,” Moya thinks shares could sink to the $30 level over the next few months.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/20/coinbases-slump-to-all-time-low-sends-market-cap-below-dogecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/580b1ada790acc35884f2747d897e92280e2fa60-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407211,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJkMV,1671552165,10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023,"Think back to one year ago. Bitcoin traded at around $50,000, you couldn’t watch sports without seeing a crypto advertisement, and you could get rich – or at least it felt that way – by minting a non-fungible token (NFT) of your left nostril.  At the time, who could have predicted the collapse of Celsius Network and Voyager Digital? Or that Matt Damon would become a crypto punchline? Or that the space’s golden child, Sam Bankman-Fried, would turn from Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader?  This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  This is all preamble to say that there are no crystal balls. Predictions are often wrong. Trends can change on a dime. But then again, perhaps after the FTX-flavored gloom of the last two months, speculating on 2023 is exactly what we need to cleanse the palate.  “As we enter 2023, what happens with crypto funding in Q1 will be critical as to whether we stay in a sustained bear market,” suspects Jamie Burke, CEO and founder of Outlier Ventures. On the one hand, he notes that “the strength of the venture market has persisted, with billions of funding still pouring into the space and high levels of capital waiting to be deployed,” and that “we have seen a record number of applications in our most recent cohorts for 2022.”  Then again, Burke acknowledges that “the venture landscape is undeniably changing,” and that “fund managers going into 2023 are conserving capital” instead of the bull run’s strategy of “spray and pray.” He predicts that next year, many investors will “double down on existing, less risky investments from later-stage companies already showing growth.”  As to what that could mean for the space at large? Or how else crypto might twist and turn in 2023? We’ve rounded up predictions from smart people in the space – from the bullish to the skeptical.  See also: The Future of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in 2023 | Opinion  1. Epic battles over regulation.  The exact outcome is anyone’s guess, but 2023 could be the year where the clashes over regulation finally reach their climax. “There’s going to be harsh crypto regulation proposed and an epic battle by the community to fight the parts of it that threaten decentralization,” says Laura Shin, host of the “Unchained” podcast.  2. Web3 platforms continue to grow.  “Larger macro downturn market conditions should hopefully shift crypto projects away from speculation and more towards utility – one major utility category simply being meaningful, fun, social experiences,” predicts Alex Zhang, the de facto head of Friends with Benefits DAO. He expects this to translate to “more meaningful Web3 social platforms and protocols,” and foresees growth in “interoperable identity, on-chain social graphs, and crypto-abstracted social experiences.”  And for a less optimistic take…  3. More bleeding, more losses, more pain.  “The contagion isn’t anywhere close to over,” says Cas Piancey, co-host of the “Crypto Critics’ Corner” podcast. Piancey says that “companies, banks and funds are desperately hoping the market moves past the FTX and Alameda collapse or strictly focuses on their malfeasance,” but whether people like it or not, “you can’t wish away a credit crunch and exposure to bad counterparties. We will see the closure of funds and the faltering of companies we didn’t expect – mostly simply due to the fact that the contagion is too vast and too difficult for us all to quantify.”  Read more: ReFi Will Take Crypto and Climate Change Mainstream | Opinion  4. Truly global bitcoin adoption.  When I spoke with Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of Human Rights Foundation, he had just returned from a bitcoin conference in Ghana. “I was blown away,” says Gladstein. “I was staggered by the number of bitcoin entrepreneurs and leaders from so many different countries.” He met people from rural Cameroon, from Democratic Republic of the Congo, from Somalia, from conflict zones. “They’re all just building on bitcoin. It’s legitimately amazing,” he says, which is why he believes that “global adoption is probably the number one story for next year.”  5. Maybe a focus on life outside of crypto/bitcoin/blockchain.  When asked for his 2023 predictions, the bitcoin mega-bull Peter McCormack, host of “What Bitcoin Did” podcast, replied simply, “Real Bedford will win the league.” Obviously this is a cheeky joke (McCormack purchased the team in 2021), but this might contain the kernel of a deeper truth: For many in the space, during crypto winter, it’s useful – even healthy – to focus on other interests.  6. Web3 gets fashionable.  “Fashion will continue to lead the way when it comes to Web3 adoption,” says Cathy Hackl, chief metaverse officer at Journey. “We will see further collaborations between Web3 personalities and consumer and luxury brands that want to explore new commerce models and customer touchpoints.” Hackl’s bonus prediction: “With the rise of generative AI, we might see blockchain play a significant role in helping us to distinguish between content created by AI and content created by humans.”  7. Don’t count out NFTs.  “The sustained high-risk appetite in NFT-funding in 2022 is a strong indicator that it will be one of the first sectors to recover next year,” says Burke. “Throughout the past year, we were already beginning to see major NFT investments from major Web2 brands [Starbucks and Disney] and across Web3. … This shows no sign of stopping in 2023. Brands will continue to flock to NFTs.”  8. Gaming and DAOs continue to grow.  Burke is similarly bullish on gaming, as “prominent Web3 game titles that have been in development for quite some time including Big Time, Star Atlas, Ember Sword, will finally see the light of day in 2023, either as full-fledged games or more playable demos.”  As for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)? “Although it may seem that the current bear market has forced the industry to hit pause, the growth of new DAOs has accelerated exponentially, with each month in 2022 producing more new DAOs than 2021 witnessed altogether,” says Burke.  9. The big exchanges become “disaggregated.”  “Exchange stack gets disaggregated – we see custody, brokerage and exchange/price discovery get broken out into different players, just like in [traditional finance]. This makes it impossible for another FTX to happen,” says Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital.  Then Qureshi offers a parallel prediction: “When trust is low, incumbents consolidate. Coinbase, Binance, Uniswap will likely gain market share in aggregate, as people are less likely to trust smaller and weaker players. Network effects get stronger.”  And finally …  10. The space regroups.  “Read the room and assess the damage,” says Sandra Ro, CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council, who then gives a bit of advice for the space at large: “Regroup with humility, rebuild with integrity, regain trust, rise again.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,"Jeff Wilser, Xinyi Luo",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/20/10-predictions-for-the-future-of-crypto-in-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32ebacab900f8280158f7b36e699152c4dc6ab31-2048x1362.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407238,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJsgJ,1671550751,ReFi Is Going Mainstream,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) took off in the summer of 2020 and has become synonymous with the last bull market as well as a lot of speculative activity since then. DeFi was born, in part, to address the failures of banking institutions to provide for a transparent and inclusive financial system. ReFi, or regenerative finance, is about leveraging crypto rails to rebuild our economies in ways that are more inclusive and sustainable. My prediction in 2023 is that ReFi will be hotter than DeFi, especially at the intersection of crypto and climate change.  Outside of the bear market and scandals, the Ethereum Merge dominated much of the narrative in 2022. One of the most discussed, debated and analyzed outcomes from the Merge was the resulting drastic reduction in carbon emissions from the new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for Ethereum, particularly juxtaposed with Bitcoin’s energy intensive proof-of-work mechanism.  Yet, this is just the tip of the iceberg regarding the relationship between crypto and climate. As we head into 2023 we are starting to see dozens of exciting Web3 projects focused on leveraging crypto rails for accelerating the path to the low-carbon economy, while new venture funds focused on ReFi are being launched to accelerate these projects.  Boyd Cohen is CEO and co-founder of Iomob, the developers of WheelCoin, a Move2Earn game that rewards users for moving green. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.  ReFi blockchains, protocols and projects  There is a surprising number of layer one and layer two blockchains that are explicitly focused on promoting and supporting the low-carbon economy and even creating ecosystem funding to encourage ReFi projects to deploy on their blockchain. The list includes Cosmos, Hedera, Topl, Polygon, Celo, Near and Algorand among many others.  Yet, what is more interesting, to me at least, are the projects being deployed on these blockchains that have a more direct impact on industries, people and the planet as we move up the stack towards the app layer.  The most dominant ReFi sector for climate has been tied to bringing more transparency to the $270 billion global carbon offset market. Carbon offsets have long been questioned regarding the credibility of the actual claims made by carbon originators and the offset buyers. While standards have been introduced to help create more accountability in the sector, there remains healthy skepticism in the public domain.  The Cosmos-based Regen Network focuses on helping communities of land owners generate on-chain digital carbon offsets. Meanwhile, Klima DAO has created a tokenized carbon offset scheme which, at the time of writing, has supported the transparent removal of more than 17 million tons of carbon from the global atmosphere.  What is even more exciting to me is that we are starting to see greenshoots of ReFi that go way beyond base-layer blockchains and carbon offsets. Every industry and consumer activity has some kind of climate impact and ReFi projects are emerging to tackle these challenges on crypto rails.  Similar to bringing carbon offsets on-chain, Reneum is leveraging blockchain tech to create more transparency in the renewable energy credits (REC) space. Meanwhile, Powerledger has been an early player in facilitating peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized renewable energy trading since its inception in 2016.  On the end-user level, I am optimistic we will start to see ways to gamify the adoption of low carbon lifestyles such as through move2earn (M2E) projects. Tying M2E with carbon reduction and perhaps the creation of personalized, transparent and tokenized carbon offsets could become a thing in 2023.  Venture funds and global initiatives  Recently the World Economic Forum launched the Crypto Sustainability Coalition to focus on accelerating the adoption of ReFi use cases. The famous X Prize, created originally by Elon Musk to reward disruptive climate innovation, is now moving into the ReFi space.  In the past few months several new venture funds and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) have been launched focused on the ReFi space such as Cerulean Ventures, AeraForce DAO, ReFi Venture Studio, Allegory, a100x, Vanagon Ventures, Possible Ventures and Draft Ventures. Just as mainstream venture capitalists have increasingly embraced environment and social governance (ESG) metrics and launched sustainability-focused funds, I believe in 2023 we will also start to see mainstream-impact funds and crypto funds, deploying ReFi-themed funds.  Conclusion  Yes, as we head into 2023 we remain in a bear market with little hope for a near-term return towards more bullish conditions. I am convinced 2023 will be the year that ReFi gains more mainstream attention and adoption and helps to prove how crypto has tangible impacts on the real world and helps to change the narrative from the scams of 2022 to a force for positive change and an accelerant towards a more sustainable, low-carbon economy.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Boyd Cohen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/20/refi-goes-mainstream-crypto-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f9f7cea4b98a0310494030dd925de97d7169b4e-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the same time, the company's board warned that it has ""engaged in active discussions about the potential for, and timing of, a voluntary bankruptcy filing"" amid uncertainty about its overall financial health, i.e., its unsustainable cash burn rate. Under the terms of the non-binding term sheet, NYDIG will acquire 2.8 exahash per second of Greenidge's ( GREE ) mining capacity, representing a ""substantial"" portion of its bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining machines, it said. That would leave GREE with 1.2 EH/s of miners and potentially erase $57M-$68M of its debt. In addition, Greenidge ( GREE ) might transfer its coupons with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) machine developer Bitmain Technologies to NYDIG. Within three months following the debt restructuring and hosting agreements, the miner will also transfer mining machines to NYDIG. In an effort to secure the rest of the loan with NYDIG, Greenidge ( GREE ) said it will pledge its remaining mining-related assets, infrastructure assets, equity of its subsidiaries and certain cash balances. That additional collateral is expected to amount to $6M-$17M. As a result of the deal, Greenidge's ( GREE ) business model is set to transition to hosting from self-mining because it will host up to 74 megawatts of NYDIG's machines. ""In the absence of additional liquidity, the Company is at risk of having insufficient cash to support ongoing business operations within the next two months,"" Greenidge said. The company estimated it will need at least ~$20M in new funding through 2023 to remain viable. The bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining space has been stung by a combination of a rise in energy costs and the network hashrate, as well as depressed BTC prices, squeezing miners' profitability. Argo Blockchain ( ARBK ), Iris Energy ( IREN ) and Core Scientific ( CORZ ) are other miners that have also flagged liquidity issues of their own.

The “Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and its transaction volume (both in USD). This ratio judges whether the current value of Bitcoin (that is, the market cap) is fair or not, by comparing it against the network’s ability to transact coins right now (the transaction volume). When the metric has a high value, it means the price of BTC is high compared to the volume, and thus the coin could be inside a bubble at the moment. On the other hand, low values suggest BTC may be undervalued as the chain has a high ability to transact coins (in comparison to the market cap) right now. Related Reading: Litecoin Continues To Slide, Now Below Shiba Inu In Market Cap Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT ratio over the past year: Looks like the metric's value has been pretty high during recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph highlights, the Bitcoin NVT ratio jumped up following the LUNA collapse back in May of this year and has since mostly stayed at similar or higher levels. This means that despite the price observing multiple crashes in the period, the coin’s value still became increasingly overvalued as volumes across the market sharply dropped. Even after the FTX crash, which has delivered another solid blow to the crypto’s market cap, the metric has only climbed higher as it has registered a new high for the year recently. BTC has only been getting more and more overpriced as the bear has gotten deeper, suggesting the dire state of the market in terms of trading volumes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: ‘Mid-Term’ Holders Show Signs Of Dumping The quant also notes that the number of UTXOs in loss (basically the amount of wallets/investors in loss), has been consistently rising throughout the bear. The metric continues to ride on a constant uptrend | Source: CryptoQuant Both these signs are certainly not in the favor of Bitcoin and may imply there is further pain ahead for investors. “A more extended bear market could be seen as a potential risk that could add selling pressure,” explains the analyst.

42407205,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJk2f,1671549547,Shifting Crypto's Center of Gravity,"The end of the year is just a date on the calendar, technically no different from the day immediately after it. Yet, it always feels like an occasion of promise and introspection. Because this is my last column of 2022, I will succumb to the temptation to look ahead and try to extract a few words that encapsulate the vast changes ahead. My plan was to avoid looking back – we’ve all been doing too much of that recently. But I realized we can’t look ahead without at least acknowledging the impact that this year has had on our collective psyche, and how that is likely to shape much of what we see in the months to come.  The root of what we’ve been through and what is coming is the changing role of emotion in our collective motivation. This shift tells the story of the past couple of years, and will shape our focus and the outlook for prices in the months to come. This may sound simultaneously obvious and also obscure so I’ll explain.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook and is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  First, the obvious part: Looking back, the year has been pretty emotional for most in the industry – even if we managed to emerge personally unscathed, we most likely know people who didn’t, and the gloom and fear around us would have been hard to escape. We generally felt betrayed by individuals most looked up to as examples of smart success but who turned out to be abusing people’s trust for self-enrichment, flat out lying and then hiding from taking responsibility.  Slightly less obvious is how we got in the position of such betrayal in the first place. In 2021, the industry made a lot of money. Values and volumes were rising, funding was fluid and we were all feeling pretty good. Emboldened by the validating price performance, we relaxed our instinctive safeguards and looked up to those who were getting really rich, because surely that meant that what they were doing was constructive. We assumed fiat-based metrics had meaning, and the jarring realization that they don’t, at least not to the extent we thought, further sets the stage for what’s ahead.  So, number-go-up made us feel good; that evaporated (as it always eventually does) and the high-profile betrayals compounded the emotional hurt, leaving us scrambling for a positive replacement.  This brings us to the more obscure part, which is the role of emotion in technology. Software and data structures are not normally associated with feelings, but the ideology underpinning the dedication of many early bitcoiners and those driving the growth of other blockchain ecosystems has incited levels of passion not seen in other sectors. This is not surprising – any technological contribution that can make a profound and positive difference to humanity triggers feelings of fulfillment that stem from the gratification of belonging. You can see this in control rooms when rockets successfully take off, in labs when a vaccine breakthrough is achieved and in the eloquence of dreamers of a better world.  Many of us who are old enough will remember the moving rhetoric of John Perry Barlow’s“A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,” which united readers in defiance of those who did not understand the societal change unfolding in lines of code.  Read more: Steps to Crypto Recovery: Where ‘We’ Go From Here  This “us vs. them” staging was carried over into the emerging crypto universe, growing on the back of “permissionless innovation” and the dawning realization that philosophy had just been given a new set of tools through which to express itself. Collective determination took hold not just because of the humanitarian potential but also because of the dismissive resistance from legacy participants that either saw the threat or didn’t care enough to bother. The common cause created emotional bonds that fueled resilience and rapid progress, and persists today because most of us feel strongly that what we are working on matters.  To weave the above threads together: Trading profits are good but they’re not exactly going to change the world, nor do they build focused communities. The thrill derived from winning shrinks in consolidating and tainted markets, and with that source of stimulation losing its luster, the emotional center of gravity shifts toward the satisfaction of creation.  This is the scene set for 2023:  A greater focus on the technological potential of crypto while the market’s spirits heal.  A back-to-basics iteration on the building that has been going on all along, while narratives have been largely focused on shorter-term gratification.  Signs of even deeper integration with human progress through applications related to other developing technologies.  The renewed attention will highlight much more than the evolution of new blockchains, the growth of scaling systems and the evolving security of bridges. It will build on the importance of markets by revealing new custody products, decentralized order books and tokenization tools. This will link to the emergence of new types of assets as experimentation continues among private and public issuers, with political progress on central bank digital currencies an influencing factor. It will also tie into the global drive for more secure, rapid and low-cost payments, both local and cross-border. And crypto-based technologies will continue to support the development of renewable energy generation, just as energy politics becomes an even more flammable touchpoint for everyone.  Moving off this earthly plane, the rapid deployment of space and extra-planetary exploration, with public and private entities engaged in low-orbit commercial initiatives and governments in a race to colonize the moon and Mars, will place an urgency on the need for resilient decentralized communication and data storage. The explosion of interest in and capability of artificial intelligence protocols could play an intriguing role in metaverse development, and the role of non-fungible tokens (NFT) will move well beyond that of collectible images at a time when international insurance, property and credentialing industries struggle with transparency issues.  These trends have a very different emotional feel from the roller coaster of markets, just the kind of emotional feel the industry needs after the hurt of recent months – constructive investment that reminds us why what we’re doing matters. Focusing on the work and the societal benefit will help us reconnect with each other, to better engage with critics and weather the regulation pipeline.  With this, we can put a pitiful year behind us, excise selfish individuals from our consciousness and look forward to continuing our collective effort to make the world a better place.

42394078,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXFRt,1671547950,Elizabeth Warren's New Financial Surveillance Bill Is a Disaster for Privacy and Civil Liberties,"On Wednesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced the “Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act,” which would impose sweeping surveillance and registration requirements on almost all participants in blockchain networks – including software developers, miners and wallet creators. The bill would also effectively ban privacy-enhancing technologies in blockchain networks. The bill is a disaster for digital privacy and civil liberties.  Marta Belcher is the president and chair of the Filecoin Foundation and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web and general counsel and head of policy at Protocol Labs. She is also special counsel to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a member of the Zcash Foundation Board. Her views are her own.  The bill would require nearly all blockchain network participants to register as financial institutions  The bill would require almost all participants in blockchain networks to register as money service businesses, including not only miners and wallet creators but also software developers. Those who would need to register as money service businesses under the bill’s shockingly expansive language include miners, validators, nodes, both custodial and ""self-hosted"" cryptocurrency wallet providers and, as a catch-all, any “independent network participants” who have “control over network protocols.”  Anyone who fits into one of these categories (i.e., basically any blockchain network participant) would need to register with the government as a money service business, develop and maintain complicated anti-money-laundering programs, collect the personal information of every person who uses their software and automatically file reports with the government about users’ transactions over a certain amount (regardless of whether those transactions are suspicious).  See also: The Coming Privacy Wars  In short, the bill would grind the entire blockchain ecosystem in the U.S. to a halt, including chilling the ability of software developers to work on these technologies and preventing Americans from interacting with permissionless blockchains. It is simply too onerous for individual network participants like developers and miners to comply with the rules for money service businesses.  In fact, compliance is not only onerous but in many cases impossible. For example, money service businesses are required to verify the identity of all users and report information about those users’ transactions to the government. For many blockchain network participants, this is simply not possible. For example, bitcoin miners have no way of knowing the identity of the users whose transactions they are facilitating and developers of open-source software have no way of knowing the identities of those who ultimately use their software.  This is by design: The precise reason that blockchain technology is important, from a civil liberties perspective, is that it imports the privacy of cash into the online world. This new bill seeks to flip the entire purpose of blockchain on its head, turning it into a permissioned technology in which all users are surveilled by centralized gatekeepers.  The bill would effectively ban privacy-enhancing technologies in blockchain networks  In addition, the bill effectively bans privacy-enhancing technologies in blockchain networks. The bill would prohibit all financial institutions from handling, using or transacting with digital asset mixers, privacy coins and “any other anonymity-enhancing technologies.” The list of financial institutions prohibited from interacting with privacy-enhancing technologies includes the broad group of blockchain network participants that would be classified as money-service businesses under the bill – meaning that developers, miners, validators and custodial and self-hosted wallet creators would all effectively be prohibited from interacting with privacy-enhancing technologies, including privacy coins.  In introducing the bill, Sen. Warren used the refrain that privacy-enhancing technology facilitates crime. This is wrong, and it’s exactly the line of reasoning we hear from critics of end-to-end encryption and Tor (which enables anonymous web browsing). That a technology could be used to violate the law does not mean that there is something wrong with that technology. Criminals have long used cash to commit crimes, but we don’t call for a ban on cash as a result. For the same reason, we don’t call for a ban on cars, even though they can be used as getaway vehicles. In the 1980s, studios tried to make VCRs illegal because they could be used for copyright infringement – and they almost succeeded. Like cars and VCRs, privacy-enhancing technologies serve an important purpose and should not be banned merely because they could be misused.  See also: The Ongoing Fight for Privacy – a Conversation With Marta Belcher  That purpose is protecting civil liberties. Sen. Warren seems to have forgotten that privacy and anonymity are not bad or illegal; in fact, they are essential for civil liberties. Privacy is especially important for financial transactions, which provide an intimate window into our lives – what organizations we donate to, what books and products we buy, who we support and where we go. The ability to transact privately allows people to engage in First Amendment-⁠protected political activities, including protesting, donating to advocacy organizations and engaging in activities that may be sensitive or controversial. That blockchain technology imports the privacy protections of cash into the online world is a feature, not a bug.  The U.S. government has long been targeting blockchain networks to expand the reach of its financial surveillance, including adding the Tornado Cash mixer to the U.S. sanctions list earlier this year. Imposing sweeping reporting requirements on nearly every blockchain network participant and effectively banning privacy-enhancing technologies in blockchain networks through this latest bill would create a near-total surveillance regime for blockchain transactions.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIL | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Marta Belcher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/20/elizabeth-warrens-new-financial-surveillance-bill-is-a-disaster-for-privacy-and-civil-liberties,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f966742faffea1b658f5a1a9b7160e0e828cf4bf-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Top Stories  Bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi has asked a U.S. court to greenlight customer withdrawals that are locked up in the platform, court filings show. Crypto held in BlockFi wallets belongs to customers and the company has “no legal or equitable interest” in funds that were frozen when the platform halted operations on Nov. 10, a motion filed on Monday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey said.  Collapsed crypto exchange FTX will attempt to recoup voluntary payments made to third parties prior to its collapse, pursuing them in court if necessary. These payments may include founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's political donations in recent years. FTX said Monday it had been ""approached by a number of recipients of contributions or other payments"" looking to return what they had received from Bankman-Fried or other FTX executives. FTX did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for clarity on this point.  FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried gave ex-Jane Street traders who formed Modulo Capital $400 million. Modulo was founded in early 2022 and operated out of the same luxury Bahamian condominium community where Bankman-Fried and other FTX employees lived. Though this amounted to one of Bankman-Fried’s largest venture capital bets, Modulo’s identity was a mystery, giving rise to plenty of speculation.  Chart of the Day  The chart compares the price of BETH, a tokenized version of staked ether on Binance, with Coinbase's wrapped ether token cbETH.  BETH is trading at the widest discount to ether's price in six months, while the discount in cbETH has narrowed to levels last seen in August.  The discount in BETH shows investors are pricing in risk on the Binance-issued token.  Fears of Binance's insolvency recently reached a fever pitch after the exchange's proof-of-reserves report did not provide details about the exchange's internal controls in Binance's margin and loan products.

6019823,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513045,1671544831,"Bitcoin Poised To Resume Its Inclination To Outperform, Says Bloomberg Senior Analyst","After the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced a surprising turnaround in its monetary policy today, the Bitcoin price managed to rise near the important resistance level of $16,900. The BOJ announced that it will drastically widen its yield curve control band to 0.50%. At the same time, it announced that it will significantly increase the number of government bonds it will buy each month. According to Bloomberg senior commodities analyst Mike McGlone, this trend could continue. McGlone shared his insights via Twitter and said that a “warm spell” is ahead for Bitcoin. As the analyst notes, BTC has taken a beating as a risk asset in 2022 with most other cryptocurrencies, but “appears poised to resume its inclination to outperform.” This will happen when the U.S. Federal Reserve eases monetary policy and completes its pivot. Bitcoin Is Set To Outperform When… According to the chart from a Bloomberg Intelligence report, the levels that BTC and the Nasdaq 100 stock index have been resisting have now turned into support. According to the analysis, the BTC price soared in 2020 and 2021 due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, allowing it to outperform the stock index. McGlone further elaborated: At a Bitcoin/ Nasdaq ratio of 1.5x on Dec. 16, what’s been consistent for most of the benchmark crypto’s history is its declining relative risk vs. the stock index. At 2x, Bitcoin’s annual volatility at the end of 2022 compares with 4x at the end of 2021. In the coming year of 2023, McGlone expects that it will be a matter of how much lower global economies fall. Investors should by no means underestimate BTC then, as the risk/reward ratio is in favor of the leading cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off $16,300, Here’s Why “Risk vs. reward appears to argue against under-allocating or estimating the propensity for Bitcoin to continue its trajectory toward becoming digital collateral,” McGlone claimed. In other words, the Bloomberg analyst predicts that as soon as the U.S. Federal Reserve fires up its money printer again, cuts interest rates and returns to monetary easing, Bitcoin will “outperform” the rest of the market again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Topside Bias Vulnerable If It Continues To Struggle Below $17K In another tweet, McGlone predicted that the leading cryptocurrency will outperform the Tesla stock. “The near-certain decline in Bitcoin supply compared to the rising number of Tesla shares outstanding favors cryptocurrency outperformance when the rules of economics apply,” McGlone said. BTC Price At Crucial Level Meanwhile, the BTC price needs to crack the extremely crucial $16,900 level in the short term and could then have a strong continuation. If so, investors should then keep an eye on the next vital resistance in the $17,350 area.

Building Web3 projects is a difficult task even in the best environments, but there’s a new founder-built accelerator that wants to help founders build and connect to potential investors.  Beacon was created by Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal, and the small contributor team includes Uri Stav (formerly chief security officer of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group), Prateek Sharma (former Sequoia Capital vice president) and Kenzi Wang, who founded venture capital firm Symbolic Capital with Nailwal, among others.  ""We’re creating Beacon because, as a network of Web3 founders and operators ourselves, we’re 100% committed to this idea of bringing the next one billion users into this space. With everything happening in the news, we know the odds are stacked against us,” Nailwal told CoinDesk in an email. “However, if we can support the best founders and accelerate projects serving real customer needs, adoption will happen – it’s inevitable.”  The accelerator’s first remote-first, 12-week cohort kicked off in October with more than 30 founders from 15 companies across decentralized finance (DeFi), infrastructure and consumer applications. Mentors to the cohort included Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu, Yield Guild Games co-founder Beryl Li and CoinFund partner Evan Fang.  Beacon hopes to stand out from other accelerators by building in-house software that can connect founders and investors. Beacon has already built a custom platform for potential investors to review projects, learn more about founders, view video pitches and request introductions. On the founder side, Beacon is working on a social network to help founders and alumni stay connected.  Beacon’s inaugural program will end with a live-streamed Demo Day in January where founders will pitch to more than 300 Web3 investors.

Bitcoin 3-6 Months Age Band Shows Large Spike In Spent Outputs As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, an increase in the spent outputs for the 3-6 months group has resulted in big moves for BTC before. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Age Bands,” which tells us which age bands in the Bitcoin market are moving how many coins right now. These “age bands” are groups that define ranges between which the coins (or holders) falling into said band last showed any movement or selling. For instance, the “1m-3m” age band includes all tokens that have been sitting dormant since at least 1 month and at most 3 months ago. If holders belonging to this group shift their coins, then the move will show up as a spike on the spent outputs chart for the band. Related Reading: Litecoin Continues To Slide, Now Below Shiba Inu In Market Cap In the context of the current topic, the relevant age band is the “3m-6m” group. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the spent output metric for it during the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have shot up during the last day | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph displays, the spent output metric has recorded a large value for the 3m-6m Bitcoin age band recently. The holders belonging to this group are sometimes referred to as the “mid-term holders,” because of the fact that their range covers the boundary between the short-term holder and the long-term holder cohorts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Monthly Momentum Reaches Worst On Record From the chart, it’s apparent that generally whenever this holder group has shown signs of heavy dumping, the price of BTC has observed a steep decline shortly after. The latest crash following the collapse of FTX, too, was preceded by a large movement from these investors. After the current spike, Bitcoin has actually already seen a short-term drop, as the below chart shows. However, it’s unclear at the moment whether this decline was all there is going to be. If past examples are anything to go by, Bitcoin usually observes a large move whenever this trend forms, which implies the real decline from the latest spike may be yet to come.

Recently, a crypto analyst named nino released an analysis showing that long-term Bitcoin positions are being liquidated. As this develops, experts in the cryptocurrency market have warned that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s efforts to rein in inflation through monetary tightening are unlikely to ease any time soon, thus has the potential to impact on BTC price. Warming Up For The Crypto Winter Nino used the Long Term Output Profit Ratio indicator. This measures whether long-term holders who sold their holdings are taking profit. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $16,855, down 1.9% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Nino found that after the CPI and FOMC announcements, Bitcoin values saw significant fluctuation. Soon after this occurred, the LTOPR skyrocketed. Many long-term Bitcoin holders may have cashed out their holdings at this time.

But this might increase in the next few days or months as Russia looks on the cryptocurrency market to circumvent sanctions.

Currently, BTC is trying to regain ground above its 50% Fib level while being supported at $16,452. A price close above the 50% Fib level would secure positive investor sentiment.

6015849,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4565479-bond-market-fed?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1671540600,The Bond Market Does Not Believe The Fed,"Summary The bump in the terminal rate to 5.1%, as per the consensus dot plots in the last FOMC meeting, was not accompanied by a similar sell-off in the Fed funds futures that would reflect a higher terminal Fed funds rate being priced in. The ECB and the BOE also talk the same game plan, but with the big difference being that there was a significant spike in German bund yields and other euro-denominated government bonds last week. M2 money supply growth is about to turn negative year-over-year for the first time in history. If the Fed wanted Treasury yields higher, they can always up the pace of quantitative tightening, which is currently running at a rate of $95 billion per month. While the U.S. stock market reacts quickly to the message of the Fed Chair (essentially “higher rates for longer”), the Treasury market does not seem to believe Jerome Powell. The bump in the terminal rate to 5.1%, as per the consensus dot plots in the last FOMC meeting, was not accompanied by a similar sell-off in the Fed funds futures that would reflect a higher terminal Fed funds rate being priced in. To be fair, “higher for longer” is not just a Fed phenomenon. The ECB and the BOE also talk the same game plan, but with the big difference being that there was a significant spike in German bund yields and other euro-denominated government bonds last week as ECB President Christine Lagarde concluded that markets are underpricing how high interest rates need to go in order to reverse EU inflation. Meanwhile, there was no such move in Treasury yields. Trading Economics Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary. Some people say the Treasury market is forecasting a recession. That could be true, even though some EU countries are already in a recession and their yields are spiking as per ECB policy. Others say that the Treasury market is forecasting a precipitous decline in inflation that would make the Fed alter its mind on the high terminal Fed funds rate, that is, the Fed won’t have to hike as much with a sharp drop in inflation. As mentioned here last week, M2 money supply growth is about to turn negative for the first time in history (on a year-over-year basis). If the Fed wanted Treasury yields higher, they can always up the pace of quantitative tightening, which is currently running at a rate of $95 billion per month. That can only be described as the “nuclear option,” as the Fed can simply flood the market with Treasuries. Trading Economics Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary. Be that as it may, it does strike me as odd that Powell is making too many mistakes for a man in his position. He has already overstimulated to the upside in 2021, and now he is overtightening to the downside. (Central banks typically have a countercyclical role, but he is doing exactly the opposite.) What Happens if Another Crypto Exchange Fails? FTX ( FTT-USD ) has now failed. ""Plain, old-fashioned embezzlement"" is how the new FTX CEO described the actions of his predecessor in his congressional testimony last week. We don’t know where the money is, but my guess is that a lot of it is simply lost, due to the leverage involved and the speed of the unraveling. At one point in 2020, some participants were trading crypto on 100:1 leverage, although over the past year, that leverage ratio is reported to have come down to 20:1. StockCharts.com Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary. Leverage of 20:1 or even 10:1 is no joke. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) had been closely correlated with the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ) and, given how much Nasdaq has declined this year (down over 31% through last Friday), it is similar to be long NDX futures in a bear market. In other words, don’t do this at home. Should something happen to Binance ( BNB-USD ), though - and its CEO sure gave evasive answers in his CNBC interview last week - the floodgates will surely open. I fully expect that before this crypto bear market is over, bitcoin will fall below $10,000, and I would not be surprised if it hits its pandemic low near $3,900.

42388328,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREIRR,1671540196,Bitcoin Miner Greenidge Reaches Debt Restructuring Deal With NYDIG as Bankruptcy Looms,"Bitcoin mining firm Greenidge Generation (GREE) came to an agreement with its lender, NYDIG, about restructuring $74.7 million of debt, though a bankruptcy is still on the cards.  Cash burn is unsustainable and the firm's board is engaged ""in active discussions about the potential for, and timing of, a voluntary bankruptcy filing,"" Greenidge said in a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If the deal with NYDIG is finalized, Greenidge still needs $20 million in fresh funding through 2023 to avoid bankruptcy.  Under the deal, which is currently in the form of a non-binding term sheet, NYDIG will purchase 2.8 exahash per second (EH/s) worth of Greenidge's bitcoin mining machines, and extinguish $57 million to $68 million of the debt. That will leave Greenidge with 1.2 EH/s of machines, and the miner will also pledge the rest of its unencumbered assets to secure the rest of the loan, which will be somewhere between $6 million to $17 million.  The loan in question had about $74.7 million outstanding as of Sept. 30. Prior to reaching a deal with NYDIG, Greenidge had estimated it would have to spend a minimum of $66.5 million in principal payments throughout 2023.  Greenidge will host NYDIG's machines, effectively changing its business model from self-mining to hosting, the filing said. Hosting has proved a difficult business model to maintain in 2022, particularly for miners like Greenidge that are exposed to natural gas prices. Greenidge's costs of revenue, which come both from mining bitcoin and selling energy produced in its natural gas plant in upstate New York, grew by 104% year on year in Q3, according to Greenidge's quarterly earnings report.  Greenidge is one of several miners that have warned about cash burn rates, including Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Core Scientific (CORZ).  During October and November, Greenidge burned through $8 million a month, of which $5.5 million went to NYDIG payments. It expects the same cash burn rate for December, which would put a significant hole through its remaining $22 million of cash and cash equivalents. If Greendige doesn't secure funding, it may run out of cash in the next two months.  The miner will host up to 74 megawatts (MW) of NYDIG's machines. As of Sept. 30, Greenidge ""powered approximately 76 MW of mining capacity capable of producing an estimated aggregate hash rate of 2.4 EH/s."" The firm owns a 106 MW natural gas power plant in New York.  Greenidge will also transfer its coupons with machine manufacturer Bitmain to NYDIG. Within three months of the debt restructuring and hosting deals being agreed upon, Greenidge will also transfer machines awaiting deployment to NYDIG, and later provide the lender with an additional 39 MW of hosting.  The miner has also faced regulatory turbulence in its home state of New York, where environmental concerns led to its air permit renewal being denied this summer.

6014827,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513044,1671539488,Ep08- Uganda – Companion Guide For BBC’s “The Missing Cryptoqueen” Podcast,"The production team flew to Uganda for what was supposed to be “The Missing Cryptoqueen’s” last episode. They wanted to show how far the OneCoin scam traveled and what it did to its victims. The results are devastating. As it happened all over the world, people in Uganda couldn’t afford to lose one dollar and ended up falling for OneCoin and losing it all. Dr. Ruja Ignatova is a legend over there. And in this episode, we also get to meet people who still believe in her and the OneCoin project. Anyway, let’s get into the episode titled “The Technology and the Dream.” Remember, you can download episodes directly from the BBC, or listen to “The Missing Cryptoqueen” through Apple, Spotify, or iVoox. About “The Missing Cryptoqueen,” Episode Eight- “The Technology And The Dream” In this interview-heavy episode, the production team exposes the embarrassment and shame of the victims. Their hopes, their dreams, and the denial that lead to this. The sheer volume of devastation OneCoin caused in Uganda, where people sold everything to get in on the early floors and some of them even got loans. We also learn that at the time of recording, as it happened in Bulgaria, OneCoin was still operational in Uganda. The organization was still working, people were still investing, and marketers were still recruiting. We get to meet many characters, but the standing out one is Saturday David. He’s a multi-level marketer who made a lot of money selling OneCoin, but also bought a lot himself. When Jamie Bartlett interviews him, he has stopped selling the product but still believes in Dr. Ruja. He also thinks there’s a chance for the money he has put in to multiply as he has promised countless people. Plus, he still believes in cryptocurrencies as a concept and his objective is to build a crypto-friendly city in Uganda. The Uganda episode was announced as the series’ last, and it ends with a brief summary of all of the participants’ lives and everything. That’s until the producers tell us that their “phone rang one more time.” An anonymous contributor called the show’s helpline and told them that they were too close to finding Dr. Ruja to quit. He confirmed that she’s in Frankfurt, looks like a German lady, and was in attendance at the Miss OneLife pageant as the production crew suspected. Quotes From The Uganda Episode of “The Missing Cryptoqueen”: A promoter gives an example of what OneCoin middle-management insiders think happened to Dr. Ruja: “She went into a safer zone because OneCoin is bigger than what people thought. So when other people got to know that it is fighting the current way of banking. So our leader had to sacrifice herself and go to a safer zone and concentrate on bringing the vision to reality.” Bartlett on what Dr. Ruja knew about human nature and the historical moment we’re living in: “Maybe above all, Dr. Ruja understood an even more difficult truth. That the difference between a straightforward scam and the complicated but legal world of finance and money isn’t as clear cut as we think. OneCoin wouldn’t be possible unless we lived at a time when people really do make millions simply by betting on cryptocurrencies, complicated derivatives, and high-frequency currency trading. OneCoin sounds plausible to so many people because it is plausible.” Bartlett on Dr. Ruja being “the inverse Satoshi:” “Ten years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency. No one knows where or even who Satoshi is, but it doesn’t matter because the idea Satoshi unleashed of financial freedom through technology is bigger than one person. Dr. Ruja is the inverse Satoshi. She stands for something too, something that’s more important than where she is. She represents the dark side of rapid technological change. Every new technology creates amazing opportunities and possibilities for people who understand it, but also the chance to exploit the people who don’t.” BTC price chart for 12/20/2022 on Coinbase | Source: BTC/USD on TradingView.com Extra Material about Uganda: Six years ago, our sister site Bitcoinist mentioned Uganda in relation to OneCoin while denouncing the project as a scam: “OneCoin meanwhile continues to make alarm bells ring throughout the world. Most recently Uganda’s central bank issued a public warning on the risks of investing in it, yet drew no distinction between the scheme and bonafide cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.” Later on, Bitcoinist pulled no punches while discussing the DealShaker marketplace: “Recently, an online “marketplace” appeared offering products and services in exchange for OneCoins, which Bitcoinist advises readers not to use under any circumstances. At the same time, OneCoin’s online website, which poses as an ‘exchange,’ has finally gone offline possibly suggesting that the scam is nearing its endpoint.” Episode Credits Presenter: Jamie Bartlett Producer: Georgia Catt Story consultant: Chris Berube Editor: Philip Sellars Original music and sound design: Phil Channell Original music and vocals: Dessislava Stefanova and the London Bulgarian Choir Previous Companion Guides For BBC’s “The Missing Cryptoqueen” Podcast: Ep. 01 – https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/ep01-dr-ruja-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Ep. 02 – https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/ep02-btc-killer-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Ep. 03 – https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/ep03-onecoin-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Ep. 04 – https://www.newsbtc.com/scams-and-fraud/ep04-onelife-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Ep. 05 – https://www.newsbtc.com/scams-and-fraud/ep05-mlm-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Ep. 06 – https://www.newsbtc.com/scams-and-fraud/ep06-dealshaker-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Ep. 07 – https://newsbtc.com/crypto/ep07-moneyland-companion-guide-for-bbcs-the-missing-cryptoqueen-podcast/ Featured Image: The Missing Cryptoqueen's logo by the BBC | Charts by TradingView",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/altcoin/ep08-uganda-companion-the-missing-cryptoqueen/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Drivechains are a type of sidechain – a secondary blockchain that interacts with a primary blockchain and aims to offer a better user experience (UX). The company’s CEO and founder, Paul Sztorc, a well-known Bitcoin researcher and developer, has been working on drivechains since 2015.  Sztorc outlined the concept of drivechains in Bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs) 300 and 301. The technology, which will be Layer 2 Labs’ primary focus, allows users to move bitcoin (BTC) back and forth between the main Bitcoin blockchain and multiple drivechains.  According to Sztorc, the purpose of drivechains is to give Bitcoiners access to innovative features and products currently confined to altcoin networks. Examples would be Zcash’s zero-knowledge proofs, a way of proving something without revealing sensitive information, and Ethereum’s Augur, a prediction market where users bid on specific outcomes.  “We believe that drivechains have the potential to kill altcoins, increase bitcoin adoption and provide the catalyst for hyperbitcoinization,” said the company in a release provided to CoinDesk. (Hyperbitcoinization is the point where Bitcoin becomes the world’s dominant monetary system.)  Besides Sztorc, Layer 2 Labs’ founding team includes Bitcoin Core contributor CryptAxe and 8-year Kraken veteran Austin Alexander.

Crypto held in BlockFi wallets belongs to customers and the company has “no legal or equitable interest” in funds that were frozen when the platform halted operations on Nov. 10, a motion filed on Monday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey said.  BlockFi – one of the first victims of the contagion caused by crypto exchange FTX’s collapse in early November – filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 28, less than a month after halting withdrawals from the platform.  In addition to asking the court to allow customers to withdraw funds that remain in their BlockFi wallets, the company also wants to clear up the user interface that incorrectly reflected some transactions (after the platform had halted withdrawals) that in actuality never took place.  “Simply put, the [clients] were unable to, and did not, effectuate any transactions on the BlockFi platform beginning the moment of the Platform Pause Time Stamp,” the filing said, referring to the exact time (on Nov. 10, 2022, at 8:15 p.m. Eastern Time) when withdrawals were halted.  The company plans to delete any “attempted” withdrawals following the platform pause from the user interface to clear up any confusion, the filing said.  “For the avoidance of doubt, the Debtors do not seek to reverse any client deposits from outside the platform into Wallet Accounts which were received following the Platform Pause Time Stamp,” the filing said.  But if the relief order is approved by the New Jersey court, any customers who deposited new funds after the “platform pause” will also be able to withdraw those funds.  In an email to BlockFi users being shared on Twitter, the company said, “It is our belief that clients unambiguously own the digital assets in their BlockFi Wallet Accounts.” The email added BlockFi will be seeking similar relief with the Supreme Court of Bermuda with respect to wallets held at BlockFi International Ltd.  The court hearing on the motion is set for Jan. 9, 2023.

""Two things: I will launch a new stablecoin – There's gonna be a $USDN situation resolution plan set in motion before,"" Ivanov announced on Twitter on Tuesday.  While Ivanov did not give a timeline for the introduction of the new stablecoin or any details, he promised that the new coin would be ""undepeggable.""  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with values pegged to an external reference such as the U.S. dollar. They can be categorized into four types, identified by the collateral backing their value: fiat-backed, crypto-backed, commodity-backed and algorithmic.  USDN is an algorithmic stablecoin backed by WAVES, the native token of the Waves blockchain. Users need to lock in WAVES in the Neutrino protocol to mint USDN, while redemptions have the opposite effect of taking the stablecoin out of circulation while unlocking WAVES. Neutrino is an algorithmic, price-stable, multi-asset protocol based on Waves facilitating the creation of stablecoins.

These payments may include founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's political donations in recent years. FTX did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for clarity on this point.  FTX said Monday it had been ""approached by a number of recipients of contributions or other payments"" looking to return what they had received from Bankman-Fried or other FTX executives.  ""To the extent such payments are not returned voluntarily, the FTX debtors intend to commence actions before the bankruptcy court to require the return of such payments, with interest accruing from the date any action is commenced,"" the company added.  Bankman-Fried became one of the U.S.' most prominent political donors prior to his fall from grace. As of May he had spent almost $40 million on political campaigns in 2022, with the U.S. Democratic party the main beneficiary.  Among the candidates to receive such donations was Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), who last week told CoinDesk TV he would be giving the $2,900 ""unsolicited donation"" from Bankman-Fried to a local charity.  Former Texas Democratic candidate for governor Beto O'Rourke last month returned the $1 million contribution he received from Bankman-Fried.

Meanwhile, ARG’s price performance after the World Cup is comparable to that of other fan tokens. The majority of them were in the red zone over the last 24 hours.

42388320,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREHq1,1671527598,Visa Proposes Automatic Payments Using Ethereum Layer 2 System StarkNet,"Payments processor Visa (V) recently proposed a system known as “account abstraction” that uses smart contracts can be used to enable automated programmable payments on Ethereum, per a crypto thought leadership post.  This solution involves the creation of a smart contract that acts as an intermediary between a user account and a contract account, allowing for the creation of a self-custodial wallet that can make automatic recurring payments without requiring the active participation of the user.  Such a move would allow recurring payments to be conducted entirely over blockchain networks, which currently are devoid of such capability, Visa said. The company proposed deploying the system on the Ethereum layer 2 network StarkNet.  Currently, there are two types of accounts on the Ethereum network: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) controlled by a private key, and Contract Accounts (CA), which are essentially smart contracts.  EOAs can initiate transactions, but CAs cannot. However, by using Account Abstraction it is possible to create a smart contract that can initiate transactions on behalf of an EOA, enabling the creation of a self-custodial wallet that can make automatic recurring payments, Visa said.  Account Abstraction (AA) is a proposal that aims to combine user accounts and smart contracts into a single type of account on the Ethereum blockchain. This is possible by allowing for the creation of validity rules for individual transactions.  One use case for AA is the creation of ""delegable accounts,"" which allow for the automation of payments through the use of smart contracts.  With a delegable account, a user can delegate the ability to initiate a payment to a pre-approved smart contract, known as an ""auto payment contract,” Visa said.  Here’s how it could hypothetically work: When a user visits a merchant's website and agrees to allow for auto payments, the auto payment contract's address is added to the user's allow list.  The merchant could then trigger a payment by calling the charge function of the auto payment contract, causing the user's account to initiate a payment that will be valid due to its presence on the allow list.  As of Tuesday, Visa did not reveal any plans to use the system as part of its offered services.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/20/visa-proposes-automatic-payments-using-ethereum-layer-2-solution-starknet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/152ced78826b1013f656a8be635e4b2f639c8a42-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

6001719,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513012,1671524107,"Bitcoin Price Bounces Off $16,300, Here’s Why","The Bitcoin price slipped further yesterday, falling below the $16,300 level. At $16.285, BTC reached a price last recorded on November 29. However, a surprising windfall occurred when the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced an unspoken pivot. The BoJ drastically widened its yield curve control band to 0.50% and significantly increased the number of government bonds it will buy each month. In doing so, the central bank sent shockwaves through global markets after unexpectedly revising its policy to control the yield curve. Every economist had expected the BOJ to leave its policy unchanged. BoJ Sends Shockwaves Through All Markets As Jim Bianco of Bianco Research noted, this is a decision of paramount importance for all markets. This decision is also essential for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, even though it may not seem so at first glance. The crypto market still follows market trends and stocks. Moreover, risk assets like Bitcoin become unattractive when interest rates are at record highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Topside Bias Vulnerable If It Continues To Struggle Below $17K As a result of the decision, the yen rose nearly 3%, to its strongest level since mid-August. Meanwhile, stocks, bonds and the dollar tumbled. The yen also made significant gains against currencies such as the euro, while gold and bitcoin rose. Remarkably, the share of Japanese government bonds held by the Bank of Japan, measured by market value, also exceeded 50% for the first time. Due to the massive market impact, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes made a (funny) comparison between FTX and the FTT token. It’s like the BOJ is taking lessons from ⁦@SBF_FTX⁩. When you own over 50% of a market is it even a market anymore? $FTT = $JGB pic.twitter.com/OePV7VLmf1 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 20, 2022 However, as Bianco tweeted, the bottom line is that markets “may” need to rethink their views on central bank policy changes: If Japan is now showing concern for inflation, there will be no pivots of any rate hikes in 2023 anywhere! Powell is hawkish. ECB head Legarde (Madam Laggard) is now talking hawkish. Kuroda and the BoJ are not making moves that show concern about inflation. Related Reading: Grayscale Says It May Return 20% Of Investor Capital, Bitcoin Refuses To Budge Yuki Masujima of Bloomberg said: The implications go far beyond Japan – with the BOJ – the last major holdout in a global monetary tightening shift (with the exception of China) – now letting the benchmark yield trade higher than before, the shock will echo across global financial markets. The Implications For Bitcoin As analyst Holger Zschaepitz explained in an earlier tweet, Bitcoin’s initial reaction may have been triggered by the price being highly correlated with rising central bank balance sheets. “Bitcoin has traded in tandem w/combined balance sheets of Fed, BoJ and ECB,” Zschaepitz noted. Bitcoin was up about $750 or 2% following a dump after equities closed after-hours. At press time, BTC was trading at $16,753. It is likely to go even higher if it breaks through $16.900 which proved to be too strong a resistance at the first attempt.

42388338,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREJCD,1671520752,"Bitcoin Gains 2%, Stocks Drop as Bank of Japan Allows Benchmark Bond Yields to Rise","Bitcoin (BTC) traded higher early Tuesday, defying the Bank of Japan (BOJ)-inspired slump in stock markets.  The BOJ unexpectedly lifted the cap on the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to 0.5% from the previous 0.25%, ending the long period of near-zero interest rates. The 10-year yield serves as a benchmark for other borrowing rates.  The central bank said the policy tweak would facilitate the transmission of monetary-easing effects, indicating that it didn't want markets to read it as a sign the BOJ is finally pivoting away from liquidity easing.  However, risk assets did just that. The futures tied to the S&P 500 fell nearly 1% and Nikkei, Japan's benchmark equity index, tanked nearly 3%. The Japanese yen jumped over 2% against the U.S. dollar. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose from 0.22% to 0.43%, while the 10-year Treasury yield jumped nearly 10 basis points to 3.69%.  Bitcoin, however, remained resilient, rising 2% to $16,800. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value after bitcoin, rose 3.2% to $1,206, CoinDesk data shows.  The reaction in equities and bond yields is understandable, considering the BOJ's policy of capping the 10-year yield near zero with unlimited liquidity-boosting open-ended bond purchases, also known as yield curve control (YCC), was a major source of downward pressure on borrowing costs in Asia and worldwide and supported risk-taking. The Yen was supposedly used to fund risk-taking activities elsewhere.  The central bank introduced yield curve control six years ago and remained committed to it this year even as the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks lifted rates.  ""The BOJ funding was the cheapest source of liquidity,"" Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital said. ""While the policy tweak is not a removal of YCC, the signaling will lead people to extrapolate that BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will seek to exit YCC by the end of this term in April.""  QCP added that the surprise decision to lift the 10-year yield cap to 0.5% during the low-volume, pre-Christmas days has raised the risk of a VaR shock but is unlikely to have a direct consequence for cryptocurrencies.  ""We doubt crypto assets are directly affected by the decision,"" QCP said, adding that a big meltdown in equities could bring more pain to bitcoin.  Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at Astronaut Capital, voiced a similar opinion. ""The initial market reaction to BOJ has been clear risk off. It’s hard to say if it will stick, however cryptos have rebounded slightly. At this stage we believe any strength or decorrelation is simply a lag. If we see equities lower, the same will be true for crypto,"" Dibb told CoinDesk.  Fin Twitter is scared that BOJ's decision has set the stage for a global meltdown.  ""Bank of Japan basically broke the world tonight,"" Christian H. Cooper, an exchange-traded fund portfolio manager at Subversive, tweeted. ""A minor policy tweak has huge implications that will take weeks to play out.""  ""BOJ was the last low-yield holdout and now that changes. Spikes in rates, stocks lower (for weeks), + Chaos,' Cooper added.  Kyle Bass, chief investment officer at Hayman Capital Management, tweeted that BOJ will ""deeply regret"" the move and the emerging world is at risk due to the policy tweak.  Strong yen, a blessing in disguise for BTC?  Crypto services provider Matrixport's head of strategy and research, Markus Thielen, said the BOJ's move and the resulting yen strength could boost demand for other assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""Japanese stocks tend to benefit from a weaker yen due to the export link, a stronger yen will make Japanese stocks less attractive to foreigners as well as to locals. This might increase the interest in alternative investments – such as BTC,"" Thielen wrote in a note shared with CoinDesk.  With the BOJ hinting at a potential hawkish shift with the YCC tweak and the Fed tightening priced to a large extent, the path of least resistance for the yen appears to be on the higher side.  ""This year was a perfect storm for USD/JPY, as the Fed's hiking cycle combined with the Bank of Japan's insanely easy monetary policy resulted in a 32% move from trough to peak. I believe next year we will see a start of a Fed easing cycle and the start of the BOJ's tightening cycle, creating another perfect storm to the downside,"" Geoffrey Chen, global macro investor and founder of the Huang Chen Foundation, said in a Substack post.  The odds, therefore, appears stacked in favor of bitcoin maintaining its direct correlation with the Japanese yen.

42388332,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qREIfT,1671500065,First Mover Asia: Taiwan's Dreams of Becoming Blockchain Hub Prove Elusive,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin heads lower into Asia hours, though some analysts wonder if the largest cryptocurrency might hold up better than stocks in an earnings recession.  Insights: Taiwan's dreams of becoming a crypto hub remain elusive, despite the inevitable chatter that sprang up following a successful Taipei Blockchain Week.  Prices  Bitcoin dropping into Asia trading hours  By Bradley Keoun  Bitcoin (BTC) was dropping in early Asia hours, down 2% over the past 24 hours, to around $16,439. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was also down about 2%. In a potentially unnerving development, bitcoin addresses tied to the defunct Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX suddenly became active.  Trading was mostly anemic during U.S. hours, with equity markets starting to reflect nervousness over the potential for any drop-off in corporate earnings that might come with a recession. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.49%. The S&P 500 slid 0.90% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.49%.  Crypto analysts are starting to wonder if bitcoin might hold up better than stocks if the economy turns down.  ""The muted beta in crypto aligns with the idea that crypto assets might be less susceptible to a drawdown in equities catalyzed by an earnings recession,"" FundStrat's Sean Farrell wrote Monday in a note to investors.  According to the crypto hedge fund BitBull Capital, the $20,000 mark looms as a major resistance point for the bitcoin market. On the downside, the next point to watch would be the November low around $15,500.  Insights  Taipei Blockchain Week was a success, but there are reasons Taiwan isn’t a crypto hub  By Sam Reynolds  After every successful crypto conference in Taipei, the narrative that Taiwan is the undiscovered blockchain hub of Asia invariably comes up. It never seems to have any legs.  Taipei Blockchain Week, a conference put together by Taiwan-focused Bu Zhi Dao (a play on the Chinese term for ‘I don’t know’), wrapped up Saturday. Despite being put together at the last minute because of uncertainty around Covid rules, there were around 1,700 in attendance. It wasn’t quite the star-studded Asia Blockchain Summit, but the energy was optimistic, despite the bear market.  It’s hard to say that about Taiwan’s prospects for becoming a blockchain hub. Back in 2018, then KMT-legislator Jason Hsu said Taiwan could become a “blockchain island.” This year, the Hong Kong-based investor Sora Ventures said it was moving its fund to Taiwan. But an attempt to create a Security Token Offering structure to allow crypto firms to raise money in a regulatory-friendly way never really took off, because of a low cap on the amount one can fundraise.  While there are many digital nomads in the crypto industry in Taiwan, including projects that purport to be on the island, few are actually incorporated locally as the rules around capital formation make it too difficult. Many business cards given out at Taipei Blockchain Week carried addresses in Singapore, Hong Kong and BVI.  “Rarely is Taiwan the place to incorporate a start-up company's parent,” Ross Feingold, special counsel at Taipei-based Titan Attorneys at Law, told CoinDesk. “The traditional corporate structures are not start-up friendly because of limitations on a founder's services as payment for shares and limitations on share transfer restrictions among other issues, as well as the corporate governance requirements.”  Authorities in Taiwan created a new company structure in 2015 that tried to address some of these issues but it's complex to understand, Feingold explained, especially for those who can’t read Chinese at the level of an accountant or lawyer.  Those that do make the attempt to incorporate in Taiwan complain about the three to four months it takes; a company can be registered in Singapore in an average of 1.5 days and in less than 48 hours in Hong Kong. Both of those jurisdictions use common law, with a share structure more familiar to international investors, and they have more competitive tax regimes than Taiwan’s corporate tax rate and its withholding tax on dividends.  At the height of COVID-19, Taiwan’s digital nomad friendly Gold Card, which allowed one to make the move provided they could prove they had an income of $67,000 or more, made things look appealing. Feingold says that’s only the case for digital nomads and freelancers.  “The allure waned if the individual really needs to be in a place where the corporate headquarters is sited,” he said. “Some of the same issues that hinder Taiwan as a startup nation existed then and remain unchanged.”  Feingold says that while Taiwan’s regulator, the Financial Supervisory Commission, has put in minimal restrictions for now, there’s always the “lingering risk that Taiwan's financial or tax authorities become more proactive in regulating the industry.”  For what it’s worth, Thailand, another regional suitor, also has complicated and arcane company formation laws, even though Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank, the most institutional of all investors in-country, actively invests and supports decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. That might help explain why Thai-based teams also incorporate elsewhere – much like those in Taiwan.

42420787,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYGzd,1671498755,"Crypto Twitter Delves Into Strange, Sloppy Side of Trump’s NFT Collection","This weekend’s episode of ""Saturday Night Live"" began with a skit poking fun at former President Donald Trump’s recently released, meme-worthy non-fungible token (NFT) collection.  “Seems like a scam and, in many ways, it is,” said James Austin Johnson, who played the 45th president in the show’s cold open.  While the mainstream media has eagerly picked up the story on the collection for its comedic value, the popularity of the Trump Digital Trading Cards has continued to climb since the collection dropped on Thursday, selling out within 24 hours.  According to data from OpenSea, the collection’s trading volume is 6,658 ether (ETH), or about $7.8 million at the time of publishing. Its floor price, which started at $99, has been hovering around 0.3 ETH, or $350.  The collection features 45,000 tokens in the style of baseball cards. In each collectible, Trump wears a different costume linked to rarity elements that allow users to enter a sweepstakes to win prizes like a zoom call with the former president or a cocktail hour at Mar-a-Lago.  In the wake of the project’s apparent success, internet sleuths have dug deep into the project and the parties behind the wallet addresses associated with Trump’s collectibles. Among the nuances and inconsistencies alleged on Twitter: the company that created the collectibles is hoarding a large amount of them; that the project poorly relies on stock imagery; and that most of the buyers opened new wallets without holding any cryptocurrency, sticking them with an NFT and no way to derive any future value from them.  The strange case of 1,000 NFTs  Over the weekend, Twitter user @NFTherder noticed something strange about a large number of the rarest NFTs in the collection. The user posted a thread explaining the nature of the transaction data of the contracts involved in the mint.  According to data from Polyscan, Polygon’s version of Etherscan, a “Donald Trump Admin” wallet minted 1,000 tokens to a Gnosis Safe Wallet, a multisignature smart contract wallet that requires a handful of users associated with the tokens to approve of any asset movement.  While the Collect Trump Cards site said that 44,000 of the 45,000 tokens created in the initial series would be available for users to mint, it did not specify what would happen to the remaining 1,000 tokens. Where another project might save those assets for a later date to revive demand, data suggests that the administrative wallet holds the remaining minted 1,000 tokens.  After the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, the crypto-hedge fund backed NFT collection “Starry Night” moved its tokens into a Gnosis Safe wallet, along with other valuable assets. It was likely done out of caution to hold the assets in one place to prevent any singular actor from moving these out of the wallet.  The Trump Trading Card site specified that there was a “strict limit of 100 Trump Digital Trading Cards per purchaser/household,” meaning that an individual or a group who did not have to abide by the rules for the general public was able to pick up a large swath of the NFT pool.  In addition, the mystery wallet isn’t full of second-rate NFTs. It minted 26% of the rarest 1-of-1 tokens and 28% of the autographed trading cards, according to NFTherder. These are the most valuable and expensive assets in the collection, respectively comprising 0.4% and 0.16% of the total tokens in the collection.  NFTherder told CoinDesk that not only do the wallet owners have the ability to inflate the price floor of the collection, but they also could have the ability to rig the sweepstakes and alter the competition.  “If this was a 10,000 unit collection about monkeys, the whole discord would be blowing up about how this is a rug and a scam and that the team is holding one fourth of the most rare supply,” said NFTHerder.  The curious marks and maker of the art  While people have been digging into the wallet addresses and collection sweepstakes, other Twitter users were delving into pop culture digital artist Clark Mitchell and the artwork he created for the collection.  On-Chain TV founder Morgan Sarkissian tweeted an image of one of the collectibles featuring the 45th president in a space suit that seemed to still have a visible watermark from Shutterstock.  She also uncovered an Adobe watermark in another token listed in the collection.  Other Twitter users have found inconsistencies in the artwork, with some of the creative assets used to build the collection apparently taken from stock images or Amazon costumes.  While Mitchell has worked on other projects such as artwork for Disney, Hasbro and Marvel, this isn’t his first NFT project.  Web3 researcher and Twitter user @Valuemancer uncovered that Mitchell also did the artwork for Sylvester Stallone’s SlyGuy NFT collection that never launched, according to the digital collectibles website.  The collection included similar creative assets, such as drawings of the actor paired with exclusive access to events such as the Ultimate Stallone Experience, a dinner hosted by Stallone for token holders.  Mitchell, Sarkissian, @Valuemancer and the SlyGuy NFT collection did not respond to CoinDesk by press time.  The shiny new wallets with no crypto  While NFT collections often attract a wide range of buyers with various stake in the game, Trump’s NFT collection had a large number of buyers that appear to be new to digital collectibles.  According to data from Dune Analytics, of the nearly 12,900 users that minted Trump NFTs, about 9,300 did not hold any cryptocurrency in their wallet for gas fees – the fee all users pay for a transaction on the blockchain. If a holder has no balance of either MATIC or wETH, he is ""No Gas"" holder. That means he can't list his NFT for sale until he get some balance into his wallet, the Dune dashboard shows.  This means that 72% of buyers were likely purchasing NFTs for the first time.  The total number of tokens held by holders with no gas is 21,420, according to Dune Analytics, which one Twitter user pointed out may be stuck due to the more advanced nature of trading on Polygon.  “It's more like a 20,000 set than 45,000,” said Tyler Warner, staff writer at Lucky Trader on Twitter, citing the data as one of the reasons why the tokens skyrocketed in trading volume.  Warner did not respond to CoinDesk by press time.  In a harsh crypto winter where NFTs are already subject to market vulnerabilities, celebrities releasing successful NFT projects or funding Web3 ventures seems like a promising sign.  However, when the project is executed before fully working its kinks out, it does not serve as a vehicle for mass adoption. Instead, it can onboard a new user base that is not familiar with cryptocurrency or the steps needed to make a sound purchase, analyze blockchain data for irregularities and fund wallet transactions.  As projects like these continue to rise in popularity, it’s important to educate holders, dig into the details and look beyond the hype.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/20/crypto-twitter-delves-into-strange-sloppy-side-of-trumps-nft-collection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60bb91cb0b71fddbba72bb7becfe476a49118b3c-2200x1238.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
