42402298,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yKT,1544203807,SEC Fines Crypto Fund $50K and Issues Cease-and-Desist,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered fund manager CoinAlpha Advisors LLC to pay a $50,000 fine following what it deemed to be an unregistered securities sale.  According to the order published Friday, CoinAlpha formed a fund in October 2017 with the goal of investing in digital assets. It reached out to possible investors, raising a bit more than $600,000 during the process.  While CoinAlpha did file a ""Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities,"" the company was not eligible for an exemption and did not otherwise register with the SEC. As such, it effectively solicited securities investors in breach of the law, the order says.  Further, the agency said that the company did not run adequate know-your-customer procedures to ensure that all of its investors were accredited, though it did hire a third-party to check accreditation status after the SEC first contacted it.  The order notes that CoinAlpha reimbursed all fees to its investors after being contacted by the SEC, saying:  ""A total of 22 investors invested a total of $608,491 in the Fund. In October 2018, after being contacted by the Commission staff concerning the issues herein, CoinAlpha unwound the Fund, pursuant to the authority granted in the Fund’s Limited Partnership Agreement.""  Notably, the order highlights that CoinAlpha cooperated with the SEC, and the regulator in turn is only imposing sanctions that it negotiated with the company.  These sanctions include barring CoinAlpha from violating the Securities Act in the future and a $50,000 penalty paid to the SEC, on top of the reimbursements. According to the filing, CoinAlpha didn't admit to or deny the allegations put forward by the agency.  The SEC's response echoes similarly light repercussions for other entities in the space, including startups Airfox and Paragon and EtherDelta founder Zachary Coburn.  While each of those firms or individuals was found to have violated securities laws, the SEC in each case explained that they had cooperated with its investigation, and imposed relatively low penalties for each.

Speaking at a bi-weekly core developer meeting Friday, the developers assembled agreed on block 7,080,000 on the ethereum blockchain as an activation point at which users would be able to elect to upgrade to the new code. Put simply, should users choose to accept the change by upgrading their software, the update would go live when the block is mined.  According to estimates by release manager for the Parity Ethereum client, Afri Schoedon, this means Constantinople is expected to go live between January 14 and 18. The block number is expected to be introduced onto the platform in the next batch of software updates.  Martin Holst Swende, security lead at the Ethereum Foundation and the go-ethereum client, said that the go-ethereum software release will also include an emergency switch to delay the upgrade in the event of any unexpected issues.  Originally targeted for November, Constantinople would bring a host of design changes aimed at streamlining the platform’s code. Additionally, it seeks to delay the so-called ""difficulty bomb"" – a code fix designed to prompt frequent upgrades – for 18 months, while reducing the ether mining reward from 3 ETH to 2 ETH per block.  Speaking on the call, developers also discussed ProgPoW, a proposed change to ethereum's underlying proof-of-work algorithm that would block the use of specialized mining hardware, known as ASICs, from the network. While progress in the ProgPoW implementation is going smoothly, developers urged that a decision has yet to be reached regarding its inclusion in any proposed software upgrades.  ""We are getting the options out there and then make a decision later on,"" Swende said.  Developers also discussed ethereum 1x, another upgrade that is currently targeted for proposal in 2019. Several working groups gave accounts of their progress, but they stressed development is in early stages.  ""ProgPoW has not been decided as something we are definitely putting in or doing. Same with any of the working groups we discussed today,"" said Hudson Jameson, communications officer for the Ethereum Foundation.  Jameson also said that following discussions on social media, meetings concerning the roadmap for the ethereum 1x upgrade will now be conducted publicly. This is distinct from the previous meeting, which was unrecorded and had notes released after the fact under Chatham house rules.  ""We are just going to have open meetings for now,"" Jameson said.

Specifically, the New York-based startup is only supporting the fork of bitcoin cash based on the Bitcoin ABC roadmap, and not the alternative version, ""Satoshi's Vision"" (SV). The difference arises after a controversial hard fork last month when the bitcoin cash network split into two different and competing blockchains with their own tokens.  The exchange has added replay protection to ensure that transactions are only valid on the one network, wrote engineering VP Eric Winer.  ""Any cryptocurrency sent to Gemini over a blockchain that we do not support, such as Bitcoin SV (BSV), will be invalid and irrecoverable,"" he said, adding:  ""We are continuing to evaluate Bitcoin SV over the coming weeks or months, and we may or may not choose to support withdrawals and/or trading of Bitcoin SV in the future.""  Gemini added that the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved the bitcoin cash listing, allowing the exchange to offer both trading and custody services to its customers in the state.

Starting Saturday at 14:30 UTC, customers will be able to begin depositing bitcoin cash into their accounts, with trading support starting on Monday at 18:00 UTC. At launch, the exchange is offering BCH trading pairs with U.S. dollars, bitcoin, ether, litecoin and zcash.  It joins a number of other exchanges in listing bitcoin cash ABC as bitcoin cash, including Kraken and Coinbase, while Poloniex still lists ABC and SV as separate coins.

42402291,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yDa,1544194844,"Venezuela to Sell Oil for Petro Cryptocurrency in 2019, Says Maduro","Venezuela's President Maduro has said the nation will sidestep the U.S. dollar and phase in use of its controversial petro token for oil sales starting next year.  According to a report from state-run media network TeleSUR on Thursday, Venezuela's President Maduro said that the move is aimed at minimizing the dollar's dominance in the industry and diversifying the global market.  Maduro was quoted as saying to the press:  ""In 2019, we have a schedule for [oil] to be sold in petros and in this way continue to free us from a currency that the elite of Washington uses.""  The president reportedly has a six-year financial plan to use the token to avert the crippling impact of U.S.-led sanctions on Venezuela's economy. The announcement of the plan – which involves setting up trading in the petro with a range of currencies – comes after a meeting earlier this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.  Maduro added that Russia is already trading oil and other products in Chinese yuan and that Venezuela would follow its example, ""progressively"" moving to sell all its oil products in petros.  Last month, Manuel Quevedo, Venezuela‘s minister of petroleum and the president of state-owned oil company PDVSA, announced that the country will present the petro to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 2019, as the “main digital currency backed by oil.”  The token was launched in pre-sale in February and Maduro has moved to integrate it into the fabric of the country's economy. Yet, even before launch, the country’s opposition-controlled congress called the petro illegal borrowing against the nation's reserves of oil.

Its order books will remain in transfer-only mode for 48 hours, with customers able to deposit, but not withdraw, any of the tokens.      After adding support for several new tokens over the past months, Coinbase has revealed more than 30 crypto assets it is considering for listing.  However, the San-Francisco-based exchange is not adding the 31 tokens to its platform just yet, but rather, is ""continuing to explore the addition"" of the assets, according to a blog post published Friday. The tokens included in the list range from ERC-20 tokens to independent projects.  ""Over time, we intend to offer our customers access to greater than 90 percent of all compliant digital assets by market cap,"" the post said.  There are some caveats however. The post explained that the process to add new tokens requires ""significant exploratory work"" on both technical and legal compliance aspects, and the firm cannot guarantee that all the named tokens will actually be added.  The post went on to say:  ""Furthermore, our listing process may result in some of these assets being listed solely for customers to buy and sell, without the ability to send or receive using a local wallet. Finally, as per our listing process, we will add new assets on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, which allows us to add assets efficiently and responsibly.""  The exchange warned its customers that some may see assets appear on public-facing APIs and other services before they are officially listed, but should that happen, Coinbase ""cannot commit to when or whether these assets will become available.""  Coinbase customers were able to see hints of tokens being added previously as well. Bots were able to take advantage of the exchange's API to begin trading 0x a few minutes before it was officially listed.  In another example, users reported seeing zcash appear on the Coinbase Wallet app before it was officially announced.  Editor's note: This article has been updated.

The bank announced Thursday that, with participation from Region Brokerage Company and the country's National Settlement Depository (NSD), it settled the “world’s first” three-way over-the-counter (OTC) repo using a smart contract. In a repo, securities are sold to an entity, with the seller agreeing to repurchase them at a pre-set future date and price. They are effectively short term loans.  For the trial, Sberbank acted as the seller, Region as the buyer and the NSD as a settlement agent. The deal was for a Russian rouble-denominated OTC repo secured by government loan bonds. The value of the instrument was not disclosed.  Utilizing blockchain allowed the three parties to automate various parts of the process, including the execution of margins, settlement and repository reporting. The deal was governed by local laws and was a binding financial contract that was signed electronically using a smart contract, the bank said.  Andrey Shemetov, Sberbank’s vice president and head of the global markets department, said:  “The combination of smart contracts and distributed register technology makes financial contracts more transparent and increases security for both clients and the bank.”  He added, “We are confident that the market will adopt our technology as a new standard for carrying out OTC repo deals and market players will appreciate all the advantages it offers.”  Earlier this year, Sberbank launched a blockchain laboratory to develop and test blockchain-based business solutions. In May, it also teamed up with telecoms firm MTS to conduct commercial bond transactions worth $12 million using blockchain.  Financial institutions elsewhere are also exploring blockchain as a means to settle transactions in various financial instruments. Just yesterday, four European banks – Commerzbank, ING, Natixis and Rabobank – settled a live transaction for a short-term debt instrument on the Corda platform developed by blockchain consortium startup R3.  And, last month, Singapore’s central bank and the country’s stock exchange developed a settlement system using smart contracts to simplify post-trade processes and shorten the settlement cycle.

42402290,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3y9e,1544185812,"Mining Firm Sues Roger Ver, Bitmain and More for 'Hijacking' Bitcoin Cash","A new lawsuit alleges that proponents of Bitcoin Cash ABC – one of two competing iterations of the bitcoin cash cryptocurrency that split off during a hard fork last month – illegally manipulated the market, damaging investors as a result.  Florida-based United Investment Corp. filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida claiming that Roger Ver, bitcoin.com, Bitmain and co-founder Jihan Wu, crypto exchange Kraken and founder Jesse Powell, and Bitcoin ABC developers Amaury Sechet, Shammah Chancellor and Jason Cox centralized bitcoin cash and manipulated the price during its contentious hard fork.  The suit claims that bitcoin.com and Bitmain (and their respective founders) ""hijacked the [bitcoin cash] blockchain,"" especially by dedicating mining power in theory assigned to mining the bitcoin blockchain to mining what was then referred to as the Bitcoin ABC chain.  In a separate statement sent to CoinDesk, UnitedCorp said the defendants perpetrated ""a scheme of fraud"" by colluding to control the network.  UnitedCorp claims that it ""justifiably relied on Defendants’ misrepresentations by investing millions of dollars in development and deployment of infrastructure specifically for the mining of bitcoin cash,"" and has suffered damages as a result.  Further, the suit claims that ""Bitmain, Bitcoin.com, and Ver have been unjustly [enriched] by the conduct described above.""  The company claims similar damages from the role Bitcoin ABC developers played in setting up a checkpoint on the network, claiming that doing so ""violated the ground rules of the network that other users had relied on and respected for years, and artificially pumped up the chain implementation with computer hashes to dominate the temporary software upgrade.""  This checkpoint also centralized the market, the suit claims.  In an email, Sechet told CoinDesk that Bitcoin ABC did not centralize the network, adding, ""In fact I explained that the result of the actions being taken by various actors in the ecosystem would result in centralization.""  Finally, the suit alleges that Jesse Powell and Kraken impacted the price by designating the Bitcoin ABC chain as bitcoin cash, and granting it the ""BCH"" ticker.  It explained:  ""As a result of the aforementioned market manipulation, the value of the cryptocurrency that Plaintiff mines in its BlockchainDomes has fallen significantly. The combined value of the forked currency is lower than the pre-fork currency and the resulting confusion has been severely detrimental to the market overall.""  When reached for comment, Powell noted that he had not yet seen the complaint, but asked, ""Why would we change the ticker for bitcoin cash?""  Damages  The defendants colluded to take control of bitcoin cash, the lawsuit claims. As such, UnitedCorp is looking for restitution and damages, along with legal fees.  Going even further, the suit adds:  ""Plaintiff seeks an injunction: (a) precluding Amaury Sechet, Shammah Chancellor, and Jason Cox via Bitcoin ABC from continuing to implement checkpoints on the Bitcoin Cash network and any other implementation of the software that would prevent the resulting chains from being able to be re-merged; and (b) requiring them to return the blockchain to its previously decentralized form with the previous consensus rules.""  Roger Ver, bitcoin.com, Bitmain, Jihan Wu and Shammah Chancellor did not respond to requests for comment by press time. Jason Cox could not be reached for comment.

42402317,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yOP,1544180419,Ether Price Now Down 94% from January's Record High,"The price of ether fell to 19-month lows just over $80 today and is now down 94% from its January peak.  Ether's dollar-denominated exchange rate (ETH/USD) slipped to $81.30 at 02:15 UTC – the lowest level since May 2, 2017 – according to CoinDesk's Ethereum Price Index (EPI).  As of writing, ETH is trading at $83.00, representing a 17.8 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. Just three weeks ago, it was teasing a short-term bullish reversal above $200.  That key support (now resistance), however, was breached on Nov. 14, as bitcoin's drop below the crucial support of $6,000 dashed hopes of a major bullish reversal, leading to broad-based risk aversion in the cryptomarkets.  Ether prices have dropped close to 60 percent in the time since and are currently down a staggering 94 percent from the record high of $1,431 hit in January.  So, it is not surprising that bearish sentiment has reached extremes, as seen in the chart below.  ETH/USD shorts at record high  Notably, ETH/USD short positions on cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex rose to a record high above 340,000 soon before press time – up 183 percent in the last three weeks. Meanwhile, long positions have dropped to the lowest since Sept. 12, as seen in the chart above.  Such extreme positioning is usually a sign of oversold conditions and presages market bottoms. However, calling a bullish reversal with that information alone could prove costly.  The outlook, therefore, remains bearish until a more credible evidence of trend reversal emerges.  Weekly chart  As seen above, ETH created a small doji candle last week, implying bearish exhaustion. That pattern, however, has been invalidated with the drop to 19-month lows.  Moreover, ether has found acceptance below $102.20 (low of the doji candle), meaning the sell-off from $200 has resumed.  The chart also shows that 5- and 10-week simple moving averages (SMAs) are trending south.  As a result of all these bear indicators, ETH may extend the decline toward the next major support lined up at $59.00 (March 2017 low).  We can, though, expect the momentum may weaken somewhat, as the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) is reporting oversold conditions for the first time December 2016.  View  ETH may test crucial support at $59.00 (March 2017 low) in the near-term.  With oversold readings on the weekly RSI and bearish sentiment at record highs, there is always a risk of a sudden corrective rally. The outlook, however, would turn bullish only if ETH violates the recent bearish lower-high pattern with a daily close above $128.00 (Nov. 28 high).

42402288,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yBc,1544176806,Mastercard Patent Filing Outlines Way to Anonymize Crypto Transactions,"Payments giant Mastercard claims to have developed a new way of keeping cryptocurrency transactions private.        According to a patent application published Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the payments giant has proposed a system of conducting transactions over a blockchain which would obfuscate both the point of origin and the amount being transacted.  As explained, the system would work by using an intermediate address during a transaction that interacts with the public key. The transaction data is then stored, while a new transaction and digital signature are generated using a private key. The new transaction data, which would contain the destination address and the payment amount, would be sent on.  The method ""would result in showing the user only transferring funds to and receiving funds from a small number of addresses that are also involved in a significantly large volume of transactions with various other users, thereby rendering the data innocuous,"" the filing states.  The amounts too may also be hidden through the use of multiple transfers using multiple addresses.  The application goes on to note that blockchain platforms are being increasingly used to conduct transactions, with users ""flocking to various digital currencies"" like bitcoin.  Some users prefer cryptocurrencies ""for the anonymity that blockchain transactions can provide,"" Mastercard says, explaining that ""specifically, it is often extremely difficult to identify the user behind a blockchain address, meaning that an individual can transfer or receive funds utilizing a blockchain while keeping a high level of anonymity.""  However, most blockchain ledgers are not actually anonymous. The application explicitly notes that transactions can be traced due to ""the nature of the blockchain as an immutable ledger.""  As a result, it's possible to identify all of the transactions that are associated with a specific blockchain wallet using public data.  Ultimately, users may be identified in this way, the patent says, explaining:  ""For instance, such data may, as it is accumulated and analyzed, eventually reveal the user behind a wallet or at least provide information about them ... However, the existing communications and attribution structure of blockchain technology such as bitcoin require identification of where the transactions are emanating and terminating, in order to maintain the ledger.""  ""Thus, there is a need for a technical solution to increase the anonymization of a wallet and the user associated therewith in a blockchain,"" the application concludes.  The patent application echoes comments made by proponents of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like monero and zcash, both of which incorporate features to hide the source or destination for transactions, as well as the total amount being transferred.  While users may prefer anonymity when conducting transactions, the prominence of coins like monero and zcash has risen enough that government agencies like the U.S. Department of Homeland Security are looking for ways to trace funds sent through the privacy coins.  The agency published a pre-solicitation document earlier this week which included a proposal for studying forensic analysis techniques to track privacy coin transactions.

42402295,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yGX,1544173219,US Congressmen Introduce Two Bills to Prevent Crypto Price Manipulation,"Two U.S. Congressmen have introduced bipartisan bills to prevent crypto price manipulation and boost acceptance of the tech.  Representatives Darren Soto (Democrat) and Ted Budd (Republican) jointly announced Thursday that their two bills – “The Virtual Currency Consumer Protection Act of 2018” and the “U.S. Virtual Currency Market and Regulatory Competitiveness Act of 2018” – are ultimately aimed at making the U.S. a ""leader in the cryptocurrency industry.""  The bills essentially ask the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and other U.S. financial regulators to come up with a roadmap to better regulate cryptocurrencies in order to protect individuals and businesses.  The first bill seeks research on how crypto price manipulation takes place, its impact on investors, and how to prevent such activities through regulatory changes, and in turn, protect investors.  Earlier in September, the New York Office of the Attorney General released a report on cryptocurrency trading platforms, finding that many are vulnerable to market manipulation (although several exchanges pushed back against the claim at the time). “The industry has yet to implement serious market surveillance capacities, akin to those of traditional trading venues, to detect and punish suspicious trading activity,” the report stated at the time.  The U.S. Department of Justice is also looking into crypto market manipulation, reportedly most recently focusing on whether Bitfinex exchange and Tether Ltd. have supported bitcoin’s price using the tether stablecoin.  The second bill asks regulators to carry out research on crypto regulations in jurisdictions across the globe and recommend any legislative changes to promote the growth of adoption of cryptocurrencies in the U.S.  For instance, it asks the regulators to clarify the virtual currencies that qualify as commodities and suggest a new, optional regulatory structure for crypto exchanges that includes federal licensing, market supervision and consumer protection.  In the joint statement, Soto and Budd said that “Virtual currencies and the underlying blockchain technology has a profound potential to be a driver of economic growth.”  They continued:  That’s why we must ensure that the United States is at the forefront of protecting consumers and the financial well-being of virtual currency investors, while also promoting an environment of innovation to maximize the potential of these technological advances. This bill will provide data on how Congress can best mitigate these risks while propelling development that benefits our economy.”  Several U.S. Representatives have been pushing for crypto and blockchain related bills since as early as 2014, when Congressman Steve Stockman of Texas was planning to introduce an act that would tax bitcoins as currency instead of property.  Most recently, a bipartisan bill was introduced that proposed creating a “consensus-based definition of blockchain” in October. While in September, lawmakers announced three bills, addressing blockchain development, miners' status and cryptocurrency-related taxes.  Also in September, a group of lawmakers, including congressman Budd and Soto, asked Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Jay Clayton to clarify when initial coin offerings (ICOs) are considered sales of securities.

42402306,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yQN,1544158805,"When Bitcoin's Price Breaks Down, It Follows a Pattern","When trying to predict the future price of bitcoin, it's impossible to do so without first looking at its past.  No matter how it's examined, the cyclical nature of bitcoin’s price action can’t be ignored especially when considering its notorious “boom and bust” cycles.  If the latest plunge below the long-lasting support level of $6,000 after an explosive rise to nearly $20,000 is any indication, it's clear the history repeating trend has yet to cease. This line of thought is potentially revealing since the breakdown of several bitcoin bubbles have followed an “opposite but equal” theme.  In other words, bitcoin's price tends to consolidate in a specific pattern when in a bubble state, which eventually breaks down in the opposite direction to a near-identical distance as the height of the pattern.  Using this logic, a bottom for the current bear market can be extrapolated, as explored below.  Symmetrical triangle breakdowns  A symmetrical triangle in technical analysis consists of two simultaneously converging trendlines, and is generally a continuation pattern in nature.  Like many patterns, a rough estimate for a triangle breakout or breakdown target can be predicted.  Generally, the pattern height is either added or subtracted from the breakout/down point to create a target, but with BTC, using the top-to-bottom distance of the base range (percentage) seems to be a more accurate unit of measurement.  A large triangle formed in June-July of 2016 with a 30 percent base range (left frame). Using the 'opposite but equal' breakdown/out logic from before, the price should bottom out 30 percent lower than the breakdown point.  As the left frame shows, the 30 percent drop was achieved almost exactly, to the tune of -29.5 percent.  The same measure rule came into play the following year when price formed another symmetrical triangle pattern. This example has the base range of 28 percent which, using the same measuring logic as before, provided the perfect bottom 28 percent below the breakdown point.  Descending triangle breakdown  The bearish member of the triangle family is the descending triangle, which consists of a flat bottom and 'descending' top.  This pattern, too, abides by the 'opposite but equal' breakdown rule.  Take the bear market of 2011 for example in the upper frame. Although the price action is not as clean – likely due to BTC being relatively illiquid on Bitstamp at the time – it’s clear that a descending triangle was the backbone of the market structure with a clear base at $5.43.  Once again, using the measuring logic from before, price should have fallen 26 percent below its breakdown point based off of its base range. As can be seen, BTC eventually did bottom out at a price level nearly 24 percent below the point.  The 2014 bear market is, in a sense, a larger scale of the 2011 bear market pattern.  As seen in the bottom frame of the above chart, the base range of this triangle is 65 percent. Perhaps unsurprisingly, when subtracted to the bottom of the triangle, another very similar 'opposite but equal' 62 percent drop marked the bottom of this market downturn.  Will history repeat?  Now, looking at the current 2018 bear market, history has already told us there is a high likelihood the price of bitcoin will breakdown from this triangle to a similar distance as its base range,  With that logic in mind, there are two possible targets for the current bear market bottom that can be created.  Since the base range of this descending triangle is 54 percent, a subtraction from the breakdown point of the triangle provides a target of $2,676.  Usually, this would be the ideal spot for the market to bottom (give or take a few percentage points) but since the price history above $13,000 does not fit in the triangle, a secondary target should be created due to the nature of bitcoin breaking down to an opposite but equal distance as its run up.  The range from bitcoin's all-time high of $19,666 to the breakdown point is 70 percent, so when when subtracted from the breakdown point, the target of $1,725 is created.  In conclusion, bitcoin's price tends to follow an 'opposite but equal' rule when recording a triangle pattern breakdown.  Using that logic, an ideal bottom zone for the cryptocurrency's most recent bear market is between $2,676 and $1,725 – give or take a few percentage points in either direction.

42402300,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3yMR,1544147301,Bitcoin Drops Below $3.4K to Set a New 2018 Low,"Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has once again hit a fresh 2018 low amid a greater crypto market sell-off.  On Dec. 7 at 1:00 UTC, bitcoin (BTC) dropped by 11.46 percent to find a bid below $3,500 at $3,306 surpassing the prior low of $3,640, according to CoinMarketCap and CoinDesk data.  In the last 24 hours, bitcoin’s market capitalization has dropped by $4.8 billion over a 24-hour period and is down more than $14 billion on the week, indicating traders may now be moving money out of bitcoin and into dollars.  As such, the move marks a continuation of selling activity that traces back to bitcoin's breach of $6,000 about a month ago, a trend largely mirrored by the wider cryptocurrency market.  According to CoinDesk data, bitcoin has now erased the largest portion of its October, November and December 2017 bull run gains and is effectively down 84.28 percent from its all time highs of $19,781.  Further, bitcoin is now down 64 percent year-over-year, having dropped hard from each successive lower highs.  The cryptocurrency isn’t the only major network feeling the pain as Ethereum's ether cryptocurrency, Stellar's XLM token and bitcoin cash each fell between 11-15 percent and show technical signs of not letting up anytime soon.  Total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies fell sharply as well, wiping away another $11.5 billion to stand at $110.6 billion on the day, a far cry from $813 billion seen on Jan. 8, CoinMarketCap data shows.
