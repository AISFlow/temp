42415163,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXm6C,1666912866,First Mover Asia: Scams on Binance's BNB Chain Highlight Weaknesses in Quality Control; Bitcoin Sags,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin was on the decline following two consecutive days of gains, after a stronger-than-expected report on the U.S. economy's health.  Insights: Binance's 26 validators could create a quality control DAO to address the large number of scams on the BNB Chain.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin slips after GDP report, Aptos recovers from debut debacle  By James Rubin  After two days of gains, bitcoin was sagging again, a familiar posture for a token that has lost more than 70% of its value this year.  Bitcoin (BTC) was down 2.4% over the past 24 hours to trade at roughly $20,300 as investors chewed over a surprisingly strong U.S. GDP report. BTC has occupied a narrow range for much of the past five weeks, although more toward its bottom support of $19,000.  On Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that GDP rose 2.6% in the third quarter, instead of the projected 2% gain. The increase followed two consecutive quarters of contraction that, according to some rule-of-thumb definitions, would have placed the economy in a recession. Central bankers have been trying to tame inflation without casting the economy into a steep and prolonged recession. The latest GDP suggested their monetary hawkishness has yet to have a full impact.  Ether (ETH) remained near $1,550, down more than 3%, ending two consecutive days of healthy gains that took the second largest crypto to its highest point since mid-September.  Aptos (APT) saw its APT token rally nearly back to where it started trading last week, before a swift crash that brought ample derision. Analysts said that there may not be enough sellers left, with many early private investors and core contributors subject to a four-year lockup schedule on their token allocations.  Dogecoin (DOGE) continued to soar, climbing more than 9% over the past 24 hours as billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk neared the completion of his $44 billion purchase of social media platform Twitter. Other major altcoins were mixed, although tinted more red than green. ADA and CRO were both down about 2%.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was down 1.8%.  In traditional markets, the tech-focused Nasdaq fell 1.6% amid a so far disappointing earnings season for major technology brands, including Amazon, which on Thursday reported a weaker-than-expected third-quarter profit. Amazon's discouraging report came a day after Meta Platforms said that its augmented and virtual reality operations missed badly on revenue projections for its third quarter. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has remained defiant even as his company’s stock plummeted nearly 25% in Thursday trading.  The University of Michigan’s monthly Consumer Sentiment Index on Friday will reflect the public’s perceptions about the economy. Earlier this week, the Conference Board reported a decline in its Consumer Confidence Index.  Insights  A Gentle Suggestion for Binance to Improve Its Quality Control  By Sam Reynolds  Research from Solidus Labs shows that Binance’s BNB Chain leads in the volume of scams, according to on-chain data – even less than the several-times-bigger Ethereum blockchain.  Certainly, BNB Chain has had some black eyes over the last few years. Remember the unofficial Squid Game token that turned out to be a rug pull? In its dying days, Binance said it considered the project to be a scam and started to blacklist addresses.  In early October it looked like Binance had another mega-hack on its hands, where users were on track to be drained of close to $570 million in crypto.  But centralization saved the day. Binance used its close relationships with the chain’s validators to push out a software update that managed to freeze most of the user’s funds. Only $100 million was lost.  “Luckily that community, the validators, sprung into action really quickly, were able to lock down the chain and actually prevent the lion's share of that new minted BNB from being able to actually leave the ecosystem,” Patrick Hillmann, chief communications officer at Binance, said on CoinDesk TV.  Hillman said that there are benefits to centralization, equating it to a small community “overseeing and keeping the doors locked at night.”  “Because those 26 validators are able to work with one another so quickly, they’re able to prevent that worse-case scenario from happening,” he said.  So, then why doesn’t this small community go one better?  When you try and publish an app to Apple’s App Store or the Google Play Store, the companies do a cursory check of your code to make sure there aren’t viruses, exploits or other dangerous items like privacy violations in the package.  Uber famously tried to sneak in some code to the App Store that Apple considered to be violating user privacy. It got caught.  The system isn’t foolproof, but it does catch a lot. Everyone agrees that these walled gardens make for a better experience (mostly – let’s ignore antitrust issues for now).  Binance’s validators, over which it seems to have tight control, could establish and fund a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that does quality control over code that’s about to go live on-chain.  The DAO could fund white-hack hackers to examine the code and, at the least, ensure there’s nothing malicious in it. If anything, along the way they’ll be able to pick up and squash some bugs.  Once the code is vetted, validators can vote to push it out to the network. Of course, this won’t catch everything, but neither does the vetting that Apple and Google conduct over their own mobile app stores. This is much easier to do with 26 validators rather than hundreds or thousands.  Binance is sure not to like its dubious ranking, with BNB Chain leading the way in scams. Having some pre-chain QC might slow things down, but it also might stop the next hundred million exploits from happening.

A Bloomberg report stated that the plan was to finalize the deal by Fri. 28 October, transferring ownership to the billionaire. As the social media platform is about to switch hands, it has raised multiple questions regarding Musk&apos;s plans for it and its impacts. Since Twitter&apos;s influence spans every sphere of everyday life, could Musk&apos;s acquisition influence the next US election? Twitter&apos;s Influence On US Election Over the years, there have been multiple bans placed on political figures by Twitter. One of the most notable is the ban of former US president Donald Trump - a move that saw calls for &apos;freedom of free speech&apos; on the platform, which Elon Musk himself has highlighted. Musk has previously made it known that when he took over the social media platform, he plans to &apos;clean it up.&apos; His idea of a &apos;clean up&apos; included making Twitter a platform that supports free speech.

42415167,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXmc2,1666905160,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Holding Steady Over $20K, Ether Is Flat, Dogecoin Soars","Price Action  Bitcoin (BTC) drooped but was still trading comfortably over $20,000 as investors chewed over a surprising gain in the latest U.S. GDP report. The U.S. Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product rose 2.6% in the third quarter, instead of the projected 2.4% gain. The increase followed two consecutive declines that, according to traditional definitions, placed the economy in a recession and suggested the contraction would heighten. Central bankers have been trying to tame inflation without casting the economy into a steep recession. The latest GDP suggested their monetary hawkishness has yet to have a full impact. On Tuesday BTC topped $20,000 for the first time since Oct. 5.  Ether (ETH) remained near $1,550, down more than a percentage point from Wednesday, same time, ending two consecutive days of healthy gains that took the second largest crypto to its highest point since mid-September.  Dogecoin (DOGE) continued to soar, climbing more than 11% over the past 24 hours as billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk neared the completion of his $44 billion purchase of social media platform Twitter. Other major altcoins were mixed, although tinted more red than green. ADA and CRO were both down about 2%.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently fell 0.37% over the past 24 hours.  Macro View  In traditional markets, the tech-focused Nasdaq was down a few fractions of a percentage point amid a so far disappointing earnings season for major technology brands, including Meta Platforms, whose augmented and virtual reality operations missed badly on revenue projections. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg remained defiant even as his company’s stock plummeted nearly 25% in Thursday trading. S&P 500 also dropped, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose slightly  In commodities, Brent crude oil remained over $94 per barrel, roughly flat over the past 24 hours. The widely watched measure of energy markets has jumped more than 15% since the start of the year. Energy prices are an ongoing concern in the battle against inflation. Safe-haven gold was down 0.3% at $1,661 per ounce.  The University of Michigan’s monthly Consumer Sentiment Index on Friday will reflect the public’s perceptions about the economy. Earlier this week, the Conference Board reported a decline in its Consumer Confidence Index.

Technical Take  Crypto Markets Remain Stable Following GDP Release, Bitcoin Stays Over $20K  By Glenn Williams Jr  Crypto markets paused their recent two-day ascent, following an unexpectedly strong GDP report in the U.S. that failed to shake investors from underlying concerns about inflation and a potential steep recession.  U.S. economic growth expanded 2.6% in the third quarter, versus expectations for 2.4% growth.  The economic expansion is a reversal from the 1.6% and 0.6% contractions in the first and second quarters. But consumer spending and the once-hot housing market have been slowing as rising prices and interest rate hikes have an increasing impact on the economy.

42415152,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXlPk,1666902511,Aptos Token Rebounds After Upstart Blockchain's Dismal Debut,"Layer 1 blockchain Aptos' token has enjoyed a powerful rally following last week's inauspicious start, rebounding nearly to the price where it originally went live.  The APT token was trading at $9.17, up 36% compared with last week's low of $6.75, based on CoinGecko data. At that pace of recovery it's fast approaching the $12 price where it launched on multiple exchanges, based on data from Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko. In the early hours following the Oct. 19 launch, the token was trading around $9 on the Coinbase, Huobi, FTX and Binance crypto exchanges.  “I certainly think it's possible that APT could rally above the open price, especially if crypto continues to outperform equities and if Aptos is able to generate some activity, whether in DeFi or NFTs,” Carey said.  The token quickly plunged below $7 on its first trading day and struggled, as community criticism over the number of APT tokens held by private investors and developers mounted, according to Carey.  There were also jabs related to the blockchain's processing speed, initially at four transactions per second (TPS) – a far cry from the 160,000 TPS capability touted by the Aptos team. (A quick spot check of an Aptos blockchain explorer showed the current rate at 12.5 TPS.)  According to a web statement from the Aptos protocol about its tokenomics, the project minted a total of 1 billion tokens, with some 510 million distributed to community members (around 51%), 190 million to core developers (around 19%) and the remaining to the Aptos Foundation (around 16%) and private investors (around 13%).  The Aptos Foundation’s allocations quickly raised a Twitter backlash, with critics questioning Aptos’ fairness and commitment to its community. The tokens held by private investors and current core contributors are subject to a “four-year lockup schedule” from the blockchain launch, according to Aptos.  Because of a relatively small circulating supply and a fairly small airdrop, there is “not a lot of built-in selling pressure” in Aptos, Carey said.  The rally has pushed APT’s market capitalization over $1 billion, ranking it among the 50 biggest cryptocurrencies overall, according to CoinGecko. The fully diluted valuation – including all tokens in existence, not just those that are circulating – is over $9 billion, according to the site.  Backed by FTX and the crypto-friendly venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Aptos is a layer 1 blockchain led by ex-Meta employees who pioneered the company’s failed diem stablecoin. The blockchain relies on a Rust-based programming language named “Move"" – also the programming language for another upstart blockchain, Sui.  While Aptos had ""a bumpy start,"" observers' interest in Rust-based layer 1 blockchains, including Aptos, Sui and Radix, remains high, said Adrian Fritz, research associate at 21Shares.",NEUTRAL,APT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | APT,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/27/aptos-token-rebounds-after-upstart-blockchains-dismal-debut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04261580330069fac398ef6f5166aa0201e4f0ad-1590x1192.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chopra told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday that, as with the dinosaurs, the principles of evolution tend to “sort everything out” when it comes to Big Tech.  “The whole metaverse is evolving … it’s unstoppable,” Chopra said. “The giants may not survive, as we’ve seen in the past when technologies take quantum leaps of creativity.”  Read more: Facebook Parent Meta Misses Revenue Estimates for Metaverse Division in Q3, Expects Losses to Grow in 2023  Chopra said crypto, like the metaverse, is here to stay but its evolution will depend on patience and a more thoughtful motivation behind Web3-based projects.  “If the motivation is only money, it’s [not] going to have a future,” Chopra said, referring to tech conglomerates, such as Meta, that are attempting to be pioneers in the metaverse. Meta recently reported its venture into the metaverse is not making the money it expected, revealing a loss of over $3.7 billion in the last quarter.  Chopra, co-founder of Web3-based platform Seva.Love, is also venturing into the metaverse.

Read more: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About the Metaverse (but Were Afraid to Ask)  “Our venture into the metaverse is only about well-being,” Chopra said.  The state of mental well-being in the world is in “crisis,” and is being influenced by the “dark side” of technology, he said. But because technology is neutral, it can be used for good – so long as the intention behind a Web3 project is authentic and purposeful.  Speaking of intentions, Chopra said he is critical of celebrities who tout crypto or other digital-based tokens or projects they know little about. These celebrities should be “very careful” about promoting something that “is not their expertise.”  Read more: 5 Principles to Guide Design in the Metaverse / Opinion  There are celebrities in the “Chopraverse,” however: Alejandro Saez, Maria Bravo, Eva Longoria and Javier Garcia.

42411071,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBW0z,1666899457,Maren Altman: Crypto’s TikTok Astrologer,"Most traders use technical analysis (TA) to foretell crypto’s future movements. Maren Altman uses astrology.  Altman has amassed a large and significant social media following for her content bridging astrology and crypto. So massive she is under scrutiny for her relationship with crypto lender Celsius Network, including receiving marketing payments, before it sought bankruptcy protection.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Trading Week.""  How big? With 1.4 million followers on TikTok, 204,000 subscribers on YouTube, 237,000 on Twitter and 141,000 on Instagram, Altman says she is “your personal poet for the stars.”  Altman studied philosophy at New York University and is an avid fan of punk rock music such as My Chemical Romance. She joined TikTok and started her journey down the crypto rabbit hole during the end of her last semester of college, circa April-May 2020.  Despite being new to crypto at a time when BTC was worth less than $10K, Altman said early on she was seeing “correlations between planetary cycles and cryptocurrency markets.”  The euphoria from the subsequent bull run of 2021 helped funnel a wave of people into Altman’s social media channels. Some were interested in her astrological predictions while others were simply curious about the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems.  Read more: How Crypto Traders Are Weathering the Bear Market  To be clear, she does not think crypto's price action is actually caused by the position of certain planets in the solar system, and she does use technical analysis in forming her trading strategies.  However, a planet’s position in the solar system at any given time is “a pretty good indicator,” Altman said to CoinDesk. “I’m very clear about it being correlation, not causation.”  For Altman, the skill of pattern recognition she developed through astrology is the same skill she uses when analyzing a candlestick chart in technical analysis.  “Both technical analysis and astrology use the same mechanism where you’re looking at past cycles to predict the future,” Altman says. “One simply has a lot of pop culture with magic around it and the other is a little more academic sounding.”  According to Altman, astrology fundamentally relies on the same critical assumption as technical analysis: History repeats and past patterns will typically hold in the future.  Altman’s astrological trading strategy  That's why Altman’s trading strategy includes both technical analysis and astrology.  For technical analysis, Altman uses simple indicators such as support and resistance levels as well as moving averages.  Altman’s astrology patterns used for trading bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are “very similar to first-order logic: If this is there, then this happens. Those will influence what I plan to enter or exit that day.”  Read more: Why Trading Is Essential for Crypto  Altman has a number of different astrological indicators, including:  If “Mars or Saturn are at an exact angle to any planets in bitcoin’s charts, that’s a bearish indicator and that will last generally a few days. During that time, I will look to short.”  If the night has a full moon, represented by the white circles in the crypto chart below, then a price rally typically occurs in the following few days. Altman notes, ""We generally dump into full moons and pump out of them.""  If the night has a new moon, then the market is at a local top. New moons are represented by the purple circles in the chart below.  Altman said on average out of 10 trades made based on her use of astrology, six to seven are profitable, typically. Most of the capital she has made was through shorting on an hourly basis during bearish periods.  Even though Altman uses astrology as a way to gain a consistent edge for her trading strategy, she told CoinDesk, “You can trade very well without astrology, no doubt, but you cannot trade without TA. There’s just no way to enter and exit a trade and manage your risk without TA.”  Boring, sideways bear market? What then?  While bitcoin cracked $20,000 on Oct. 25, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had been ranging around $19,000 for the past 30 days, as CoinDesk noted on Oct. 20.  Crypto traders, who historically love volatility in the markets, are in a bit of a lull because bitcoin’s 30-day volatility was at its lowest point in almost two years last week.  Altman said, “During this time, it’s a little bit frustrating for traders, even myself, that the market is not moving a ton. So I find myself not as interested. In this period I don’t think there’s a better time to build because you’re not being swayed by euphoria.”  Read More: 9 Survival Tips for Crypto Winter  Altman is currently building what she calls an “astrology-based blockchain ecosystem” called Astrace, which is “bridging the gap between planets and profits,” according to the homepage.  Using the same first-order logic of “if-then” Altman uses, Astrace’s algorithm is intended to predict the price movements of cryptocurrencies.  According to Altman, Astrace’s algorithm analyzes planetary data, such as the position and movement of Jupiter in the Earth’s solar system, for its predictions.  Financial astrology is not new: Astrology trading software exists, and day traders have already been using astrology.  Through Astrace, Altman will be attempting to combine two areas outside the traditional finance mainstream: blockchain technology and astrology.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 2015 likened blockchain to magic. Altman, perhaps with the stars as her guide, is working at reinforcing and strengthening the bridge between astrology and crypto.  “I hope to be a journalistic documentation of how the strategy plays out, but that’ll take a few years,” she said.  Read More: 15 Ways to Stay Sane While Trading Crypto  Past and current predictions  On Jan. 22, 2022, Altman tweeted, “may 10th + october 28th. do what you will.” The tweet is currently pinned on her Twitter profile.  The crypto markets on May 10 and May 11 were in “a sea of red,” CoinDesk reported. Terra’s LUNA token dropped as much as 96%, BTC declined by roughly 6%, ETH slid 9% and Solana’s SOL token decreased by 30% in the span of 24 hours.  Altman is expecting similar market movements in the near future.  Altman’s bearish sentiment is based on several astrological indicators: the Oct. 25 solar eclipse occurring in the constellation Scorpio, and Jupiter re-entering the constellation Pisces on Oct. 28.  “This week has several astrological shifts that do hint towards quite a move towards the downside in terms of the market,"" Altman said in a video posted on TikTok and Twitter. ""It’s literally going to be a big week, like worldwide everything.”  Meanwhile, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, slid 0.94% in the past 24 hours but has climbed 7.6% since Monday, Oct. 24.

42420886,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZNt,1666899402,"Crypto Markets Remain Stable Following GDP Release, Bitcoin Stays Over $20K","Crypto markets paused their recent two-day ascent, following an unexpectedly strong GDP report in the U.S. that failed to shake investors from underlying concerns about inflation and a potential steep recession.  U.S. economic growth expanded 2.6% in the third quarter, versus expectations for 2.4% growth.  The economic expansion is a reversal from the 1.6% and 0.6% contractions in the first and second quarters. But consumer spending and the once-hot housing market have been slowing as rising prices and interest rate hikes have an increasing impact on the economy.  BTC declined 1% during the 13:00 UTC hour, but rose 0.92% in the following hour. ETH performed similarly, decreasing 1.72% immediately following the GDP release but then rising 1.17%.  Traditional markets were mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) started the day up 1.5%, trading immediately higher at the 9:30 a.m. ET open. The S&P 500 opened 0.64% higher following the GDP report. The Nasdaq composite, to which bitcoin remains strongly correlated, fell 0.30%.  A portion of the Nasdaq decline is likely due to the 21% drop in Meta Platforms (META) shares, following poorer-than-expected third-quarter earnings results.  As the calendar shifts to November, investor attention can next move to the October consumer price index data, to be released Nov. 10.  According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability of a 75 basis point (bps) interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve at its next meeting has declined from 92.5% to 88.4% since Wednesday, while the probability of a 50 bps increase rose from 7.5% to 11.6%.  The shift in sentiment will likely have little effect for the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where any rate hike will be set. A 75 bps rise still seems highly likely on Nov 2. But observers believe increasingly the FOMC will pivot to a more dovish stance early next year, perhaps influenced by the U.S. neighbor to the north. Canada’s central bank raised its interest rate by 50 bps on Wednesday instead of by an expected 75 bps because of concerns about the slowing pace of that country’s economy.  Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to plague crypto assets, so the BTC-DXY chart will be a solid one to consider in determining the next steps.  A reversion to a more inverse relationship between BTC and the dollar index (DXY) has occurred over the last few days. Thus, strength in the U.S. dollar is likely bad news for the BTC price, while weakness in the USD will likely have the opposite effect.  The 4% decline in the DXY since Sept. 27 hints a growing appetite for riskier assets as investors start to pivot away from the USD.  Bitcoin also appears to be forming potential support at $20,000. The Volume Profile Visible Range tool shows a high-volume node forming at $20,500, which would overtake the prior high volume node at $19,300.  These nodes indicate areas of significant price agreement and can often highlight areas of support and resistance for an asset.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/27/crypto-markets-remain-stable-following-gdp-release-bitcoin-stays-over-20k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27b44c762bb7180e920a7e24436b9b964e89e0d5-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420953,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtw8z,1666898818,Read 'em and Weep: Five Crypto Influencers Who Dealt Their Followers a Bad Hand,"Influencers, as their title suggests, have enormous leverage on social media, with an ability to introduce audiences to the latest trends and often persuade them to take action, such as making purchases based on the influencer’s recommendations.  When the product is a pair of kicks or a new phone, the buyers may be a few hundred dollars lighter but have designer goods to wear, show off and maybe even mock. When the product is crypto, however, buyers may have nothing to show for it except depleted savings if the tout goes south.  Here are some social media celebrities and high-profile crypto industry natives with millions of followers who have made spectacularly bad crypto promotions.  Ben Armstrong  Crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, best known as “Bitboy Crypto” with over 1.4 million subscribers on YouTube, faced backlash over some of his hyped content, with one user going so far as to call seven of his touts outright scams in an investigative thread on Reddit.  The Atlanta native quickly gained attention in 2018 by sharing crypto trends, trading advice, project reviews and sometimes investment strategies, all while driving around in his car. In March 2022, he posted a video claiming his crypto portfolio was worth around $33 million and included bitcoin, ether and other altcoins.  In what may have been his most consequential failed tout, Armstrong was one of the most vocal supporters of crypto lender Celsius Network. He first talked about the lending platform in a 2018 project review video. “I do have faith in Celsius and I do believe it will be a successful project,” he said. In the March 2022 portfolio reveal video, he told his YouTube audience that the BitSquad held 25,000 of Celsius’ CEL tokens (worth over $83,000 at that time and around $23,000 as of press time).  Celsius froze billions of dollars from depositors in June, and Armstrong said he was one of the victims of the lending platform’s collapse. He admitted during his show that his team “worked with Celsius for years … some partnership stuff.”  Armstrong’s “affiliate link for Celsius” admittedly made it challenging for him to be the leader of a class-action lawsuit against Celsius because of such “conflict of interest,” he tweeted to his 900,000 followers on Twitter.  In a July Washington Post interview, Armstrong declared he has never been involved in a scam and his motivation was trying to “help people.” The following month, CNBC reported that Armstrong admitted he had entered paid partnerships. Armstrong said he felt responsible for losses suffered by his followers and said he stopped accepting pay for his promotions in January.  Kim Kardashian  With 332 million followers on Instagram and nearly 74 million followers on Twitter, reality TV star Kim Kardashian plunged into trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a crypto promotion.  In October, Kardashian settled with the U.S. regulator, agreeing to pay a $1.26 million fine for not properly disclosing the $250,000 payment she received for promoting the ethereumMax digital token EMAX on Instagram.  The high-profile and prolific influencer, who usually hawks her family's reality shows, her own Skims shapewear line, other designers’ fashion – sometimes as paid ads – and lately her new criminal justice podcast, posted an Instagram story touting EMAX in June 2021.  “Are you guys into crypto????” the post began, along with a link to the EthereumMax project website. “This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends just told me about the Ethereum Max token! A few minutes ago Ethereum Max burned 400 trillion tokens – literally 50% of their admin wallet giving back to the entire E-Max community.”  Things didn’t work well for EMAX investors: the token price has plunged 97% since Kardashian’s post, CoinDesk reported this month. A British finance regulator at the time pointed out it was one of the biggest financial promotions in history.  Along with the fine, the SEC barred Kardashian from promoting any cryptocurrencies for three years.  Lark Davis  Crypto investor Lark Davis is a go-to resource for many when it comes to learning about crypto trading. With over 1 million followers on Twitter and over 480,000 subscribers on YouTube, as well as a two-year-old weekly newsletter, Wealth Mastery, Davis has provided analytical videos on bitcoin and altcoins for five years. But recently he was hit with a storm of ""pump-and-dump"" allegations.  Self-proclaimed on-chain sleuth ZachXBT in September accused the New Zealand-based influencer of making over $1 million by dumping crypto projects. In a Twitter thread, ZachXBT traced Davis’ wallet and cited eight examples, beginning in February 2021, where Davis promoted low-cap crypto projects before dumping them.  Davis denied the allegations of shilling low-cap projects on Twitter, saying he has done “nothing wrong.”  Then ZachXBT made a second allegation, accusing Davis of withdrawing $2.5 million from crypto lender Celsius mere days before the now-bankrupt company froze withdrawals, swaps and transfers on June 12.  Davis posted videos with a Celsius referral link as recently as June 10. He had been promoting Celsius with his own promo code, LARK, to his YouTube audience throughout the first half of the year, CoinDesk found. A Twitter user pointed out that Davis promoted Celsius for weeks after he had begun making his withdrawals.  Davis has not responded to CoinDesk as of press time.  PlanB  PlanB made his name as one of the top bitcoin influencers on Twitter, with more than 1.8 million followers, because of his invention of a bitcoin price forecast model he dubbed “stock to flow.”  The model predicts the bitcoin price based on its circulating supply relative to the number of coins mined each year, but it hasn’t been accurate lately. For instance, the model predicted bitcoin reaching over $100,000 on Oct. 23 when the largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading below $20,000.  Its increasingly off-kilter price forecasts have also been criticized by many in the crypto community, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.  'nuff said.  Floyd Mayweather  Floyd Mayweather, Jr. earned 15 major world boxing championships and retired in 2017 from professional boxing with a 21-year undefeated record. But he got knocked by the backlash from several promotions of shady crypto projects.  Mayweather promoted initial coin offerings (ICO) to his 28.4 million followers on Instagram and 7.8 million on Twitter as early as 2017, including the now-inactive prediction markets platform Stox and the ICO project of a dubious financial provider called Centra Tech. “Centra's (CTR) ICO starts in a few hours. Get yours before they sell out, I got mine,"" he tweeted.  Centra Tech, which fraudulently claimed to be producing financial projects with Visa and Mastercard, was later halted by the SEC. The athlete in 2018 paid more than $600,000 in fines to settle SEC charges that he promoted ICOs without disclosing payments from token issuers.  Mayweather recently got sued again, along with Kim Kardashian, over his 2021 promotion of ethereumMax. As recently as late September, the boxing legend sought to dismiss the claims against him in a class-action lawsuit, arguing the lawsuit was an attempt to target his wealth.  The notoriety has not stopped Mayweather, however. He is currently touting his own non-fungible token collection, Mayweverse. Earlier this year, he promoted the Bored Bunny NFT collection, a send-up of Bored Apes, to his nearly 8 million followers on Twitter. Many have accused the founders of Bored Bunny of orchestrating a rug pull.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/27/social-media-crypto-influencers-who-got-it-wrong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d9aeceec17bd9fc7ae113a7e92e9dd4271ce4d4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto Fear And Greed Index Escapes Out Of &apos;Extreme Fear&apos; Zone The &apos;fear and greed index&apos; is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the cryptocurrency market. The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from zero to hundred for displaying this sentiment. All values above fifty signify greed in the market, while those below the threshold suggest fear amongst the investors. Besides these two, there also exist two special sentiments called the &apos;extreme fear&apos; and the &apos;extreme greed.&apos; These take place at values lower than 25 and greater than 75, respectively. The significance of these zones is that coins like Bitcoin have historically observed bottom (extreme fear) and top (extreme greed) formations during such periods. Now, here is a chart from this week&apos;s Arcane Research report that shows the trend in the crypto fear and greed index over the past year: Looks like the value of the metric has been mostly flat in recent weeks | Source: Arcane Research&apos;s The Weekly Update - Week 42, 2022 As you can see in the above graph, the crypto fear and greed index had been moving sideways in the 20 to 25 range for over a month when the report came out, which was two days ago.

The Google Cloud BNE is a &apos;node-hosting service that can minimize the need for node operations&apos; and allows web3 firms to relay transactions, deploy smart contracts and read or write blockchain data directly on Google Cloud.

Brink has funded more active Bitcoin Core developers and reviewers – eight contributors with at least 10 commits – than any other organization in the past 12 months, BitMex said. On GitHub, commits are snapshots of changes and updates made by developers and are often used to gauge developer activity.  Brink has also funded seven of the top 30 Bitcoin Core reviewers over the same period. Reviewers are developers who review pull requests – proposed software updates waiting to get merged with the main Bitcoin Core project.  Organizations like Brink are critical to the Bitcoin ecosystem. The biggest cryptocurrency by market value is completely volunteer-driven, unlike crowdfunded projects such as Ethereum that receive support from foundations with full-time staff.  “Bitcoin did not have a crowdsale! The protocol should be neutral and there is a need to minimize potential conflicts of interest,” the presentation stated.  BitMex’s charts show an increasingly diverse Bitcoin funding landscape with research firms like Chaincode Labs and FinTech companies like Block (formerly Square) also making significant contributions to Bitcoin Core development.  Brink was founded in 2020 with the goal of supporting Bitcoin protocol development. The organization runs a year-long fellowship program as well as a developer grant program. Brink co-founder and Executive Director Mike Schmidt is also a key contributor to the popular Bitcoin Optech weekly newsletter.

42394173,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXu4F,1666888638,Halloween Costumes for Broke Crypto Traders,"Halloween is fast approaching, and if you’re like me you’ve put off coming up with a costume idea. Fear not!  CoinDesk has you covered with a list of crypto-themed outfits you can put together with stuff lying around your house.  The bear market has been a blessing, offering a convenient excuse for why you didn't purchase a costume for Oct. 31. If anyone asks what you're dressed as, just call yourself a crypto trader, pull out your empty wallet and pantomime how you lost it all. They’ll get it. Boy, will they get it.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Below are a few costume concepts, ordered top to bottom from the ultra-lazy and cheap to the more involved. Take them and make them your own.  Blockchain Fork: Do you own a fork? Good, whenever your friends ask where they should head next, hold it high and say “I’m proposing a fork.”     The Merge: Steal a road sign and lug it around.  A White Paper: Cover yourself in a ream of looseleaf paper. (Although podcaster Laura Shin will always wear it best.)  Margin Call: A white T-shirt with “margin” written across it, and a prop phone.  Blockchain Evangelist: This is more performative. Dress up as a preacher and tell people about how crypto has arrived and the end is near for fiat.  A DAO: Wear a rope over your shoulders and carry a stack of poker chips. When someone asks what your costume is, say, ""I'm a DAO, I have a token and dis cord.""  See also: DAOs on Discord: Where to Go, What to Know  The Third Arrow: Buy one of those headbands that makes it look like an arrow is going through your head. For brownie points, ask strangers if they’ve seen your friends Su Zhu and Kyle Davies. “They were just here a moment ago.”  Caitlin Long-Dead: Dress up like beloved crypto doyen and Cowboy Stater, but as a zombie.  Blood Garlinghouse: If you are Ripple founder Brad Garlinghouse, just call yourself Blood. If you are anyone else, dress up as Brad Garlinghouse covered in blood.  Ferocious: Like the lovable NFT artist FEWOCiOUS, but act like you have rabies.  The Bear Market: A bear dressed as a janitor, to “clear out the junk.”  LUNA-Tic: Your standard-fare tic costume, with LUNA written on it. If it doesn’t land, say you’re werewolf Gregor Samsa.  Sexy Charles Hockinson: If you are a falconer (like Cardano’s self-effacing founder), bring around your bird of prey, but show a little skin.  “You’re Size Is Not Size”: Riffing on embarrassed Terra founder Do Kwon’s infamous taunt, wear clothing that is clearly a few sizes too small.  Not Trading Advice: Dress up like a venture capitalist going on safari. But preface and end every conversation you have with “This is not trading advice.”  Proof-of-Stake: Carry around a magnifying glass and print out a teeny tiny image of a steak diner. Ask people what they see. Eureka, it’s steak!  Log Scale: ""Yes, the market has crashed. But if you zoom out, bitcoin is still the best-performing asset of the past decade."" Carry around a bathroom scale and Lincoln logs.  Proof-of-Work: Print out your completed crypto startup OKRs to show everyone what you’ve accomplished this quarter.  Merkle Tree: Combine an Angela Merkel mask with a tree costume.  UST Breaking the Buck: A deer costume, shot dead – like the algorithmic stablecoin that dropped below $1.  CIA asset: For this one, you'll also need to dress up as Charles Hoskinson.  Inflation hedge: Dress up like a privet hedge with an LED screen that shows a .gif of rising prices. (Does the costume work? Not really. But neither did BTC as a hedge.)  Tungsten cube: A cardboard box lined with tungsten. For extra fun, ask your friends to pick you up – marvel when they realize how dense you’ve become.

42415154,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXlV3,1666885620,NFT Marketplace LooksRare Switches to Optional Royalties,"Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace LooksRare said in a statement on Thursday that it will no longer require collectors to pay royalties to creators when purchasing digital collectibles.  The platform, which has the fifth-largest trading daily volume among NFT marketplaces according to DappRadar, said that rather than supporting royalties “by default” it will instead distribute 25% of platform fees to creators and collection owners. Buyers can now “opt in” to pay royalties at checkout.  The platform’s “Trading Rewards” distribution ratio has also been updated to favor sellers.  “The growth of zero-royalty marketplaces has eroded the general willingness to pay royalties throughout the NFT space,” the company explained, adding that its new royalty structure is meant to be “a competitive solution that still benefits creators.”  LooksRare’s decision follows a trend of NFT platforms dropping requirements for artist payouts. In August, marketplace X2Y2 ended its royalty requirements, making them optional at the discretion of the buyer. And earlier this month, Solana blockchain-based marketplace Magic Eden followed suit.  While conversations around whether buyers should be obligated to pay royalties to NFT creators for their art, LooksRare specifies that its 25% protocol fee will still support both parties by sharing the burden associated with listing tokens on the platform.  “The industry is trending towards zero royalties, but it’s still our responsibility to support creators in the new landscape,” LooksRare said in the statement.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | SOL | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/27/nft-marketplace-looksrare-switches-to-optional-royalties,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/babd2470458b0a2bee3d9d0a1aa397e2f7d7d139-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42415153,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXlKR,1666885077,Crypto Exchange Huobi Delists Its HUSD Stablecoin,"Crypto exchange Huobi Global is cutting ties with its closely linked stablecoin, the troubled asset HUSD.  In a notice to users, Huobi, the top trading venue for the $219 million market-cap stablecoin, cited its rules for performing “regular inspection” on listed assets. Huobi, a top 10 exchange by trading volume that recently agreed to be acquired by About Capital, said it will begin delisting HUSD at 8:00 UTC Friday and will in the interim begin converting assets to USDT on a 1:1 basis.  HUSD is a relatively minor stablecoin that Huobi launched in 2018 as a “stablecoin solution” that accepted other dollar-pegged tokens as backing. It was issued by Stable Universal but was heavily marketed by Huobi as a token that was “exclusive” to its own exchange when it launched.  The move continues a wave of consolidations and jockeying in crypto’s $140 billion stablecoin subsector that has long been dominated by USDT. But an influx of newcomers has recently shaken that grip.  HUSD has had its own problems. In August, the stablecoin briefly lost its dollar peg and crashed 8% after its issuer closed “several accounts” due to regulatory concerns.  A representative for Huobi did not immediately respond to CoinDesk.

The funds will go toward building out the development team, scaling the technology infrastructure and funding security audits for the platform, co-founders Solal Afota and Nathaniel Masfen-Yan told CoinDesk in an interview.  Bain Capital, an investment firm with about $155 billion in assets, launched Bain Capital Crypto in March with $560 million in committed capital. Other investors in the Notebook Labs’ round included Y Combinator, Soma Capital, Abstract Ventures, Pioneer Fund and NFX, among others.  “Until now, blockchain users have been required to identify themselves with wallet addresses, which has not only compromised their privacy but has also subjected the blockchains themselves to Sybil attacks,” said Afota, referring to a type of cyberattack in which the hacker creates a number of fake accounts to gain increased access.  “Notebook is paving the way towards mass adoption of DeFi by giving Web3 users the privacy and anonymity they deserve, while also enabling more secure logins that will make protocols safer,” he continued, referring to decentralized finance.  Notebook Labs intends to offer a way for Web3 protocols to verify the identity of users without compromising anonymity through a technology called zero-knowledge (zk) proofs, which algorithmically show that a statement is true without sharing the details behind that example. For example, a protocol could require proof that users are U.S. citizens. Users would supply their license as proof, but the license wouldn't be linked to the user’s wallet.  Trackable yet anonymous verified data can open up a variety of use cases in crypto, particularly within DeFi where the lack of traditional credit scores leads to over-collateralized loans.  California-based Notebook Labs was founded earlier this year by Stanford undergraduates Afota, Masfen-Yan and Dhruv Mangtani after creating the project during the university’s largest hackathon.  The version of Notebook Labs that’s currently live can be used to develop a Sybil-resistant protocol and run airdrops, said Masfen-Yan. The team will continue developing the full product suite over the coming months, including credit scoring and cross-chain capabilities, and should launch next year.

DEC, a software developer, will use the proceeds to further grow Teleport, which is powered by DEC’s TRIP protocol. The project is built on Solana.  Teleport seeks to address some of the headwinds faced by traditional ride sharing, giving control back to drivers and customers, according to its founder, Paul Bohm. “We're giving ownership to anyone who brings people using the protocol, because the protocol should reward the people building it well,” Bohm told CoinDesk.  The seed funding was co-led by Steve Vassallo at Foundation Capital and Thomas Bailey at Road Capital. Additional strategic investors that joined the round included Josh Mohrer, who was previously a general manager of Uber New York.  Teleport’s app is expected to be live at the end of the fourth quarter of this year, the company said in a statement Thursday. It will be piloted at Solana’s Breakpoint event in November, as well as at Art Basel in Miami this December.  “By turning ride-sharing into a protocol, Teleport is building what we couldn’t build at Uber in 2010, and what Uber should be building today,” Ryan McKillen, a former product manager and the first software engineer at Uber who also participated in Teleport's seed funding, said in the statement. “Riders and drivers will migrate from centralized middlemen to an open economy with aligned economic incentives.""

42394134,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXszZ,1666876147,How Crypto Traders Are Reinventing Venture Capital,"“Crypto’s $3 trillion of liquid value creation in 10 years now rivals that of all other venture-backed startups combined.” – Messari.io  Powered by blockchain technology, digital assets offer new trading and investing opportunities with more liquidity and speed. What we refer to as “liquid venture” – digital assets issued by early-stage companies or projects – expands the tradable landscape.  Venture capital (VC) investments tend to generate net returns that outperform the S&P 500, but they are inaccessible and illiquid, with average fund lockup periods of seven to 10 years. Experienced traders who consider the unique nuances and risks of liquid venture can have novel alternatives to long-term, locked-up VC investing.  Wes Hansen is the director of trading and operations at Arca. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Trading Week.""  Traditionally, young businesses have had limited funding options, with most depending on VC financing to build their companies. Similarly, access to startup investment opportunities is notoriously gated for the ultra-wealthy or select funds. As a result, investors have sought alternatives to expand this pool of opportunities.  Recently, blockchain has enabled startups to bootstrap their projects by issuing tokens. The digital asset ecosystem democratizes startup investing by granting everyday investors wider access to potentially outsized returns of liquid venture markets, often allowing traders to buy and sell assets without restrictive holding periods.  However, traditionally a startup has the benefit of time to experiment and grow without public scrutiny or worries over token price movement. But once a company offers a publicly tradable asset into the market, it is subject to increased regulatory review.  Digital asset projects feel many of the growing pains of traditional startups – immature organizational processes, hiring and fundraising responsibilities, product rollouts and technology bugs – but they are experienced much more publicly. When a team faces obstacles or struggles to find product market fit, every misstep or dip in growth is magnified by the team’s public persona and the price action of its token.  See also: Why Crypto Trading is Essential for the Cryptocurrency Industry | Opinion  Many teams are unprepared for the added stress and complexities that come with public oversight and pressure. As a trader in this space, the long-term play is less relevant when your investment is continually marked to market.  The nature of trading liquid venture can be complex and volatile because of the myriad factors that can affect token price. For this reason, trading liquid venture tends to be best suited to traders who are able to actively monitor the idiosyncrasies of the ecosystem with the support of analysts and other traders around them.  Some factors to consider include:  Nascence: Venture projects and their tokens are often powered by small, young teams with limited resources. Inexperience, poor communication, misaligned priorities and infighting can cause projects to implode at any time.Successful teams show patience and diligence and delay the short-term gratification of a high token price to prioritize the business’ and customers’ best interests. These teams understand that focusing on their company’s long-term success will be advantageous for future sustained price growth.  Resilience: Traders must be quick with decisions, flexible with investment theses and knowledgeable about factors that drive token prices. Agility and resilience to move on from a bad trade while maintaining the ability to evaluate the next trade properly are paramount. And balance is key: A bad trade should neither make one fearful of greater losses nor overly aggressive to recompense. A good trade shouldn’t garner overconfidence, which could lead to overlooking red flags.  Information: On-chain metrics like revenue, volume, users or active addresses and total value locked (TVL) can provide a real-time picture of a token or a company's health. Additionally, startups must provide public information through transparency reports.  Regulation: Inconsistent and often sudden decisions adversely affect token prices because regulators can unexpectedly subpoena a token project for exploratory inquiries or violating outdated regulations. Digital assets and startups need clear, relevant and fluid regulation that will allow those in the space to experiment and evolve. Otherwise, maintaining legacy frameworks for novel technology will create noncompliant companies, push teams to build in other countries and prevent the U.S. from being the dominant venue for digital asset industry growth.  Investors with venture experience know the peaks and valleys of investing can be exhilarating and unpredictable. But for liquid venture, these swings occur publicly with an asset that immediately reacts to news.  See also: A Day in the Life of a Crypto Trader  Sometimes there is neither room for error nor recovery – the market is an immediate indicator of an issue or of success.

42394138,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXt9p,1666875712,4 Questions That Will Determine the Future of Retail Trading,"As someone who worked in fintech before crypto I’ve always found the differences in nomenclature between these two related sectors to be intriguing. In fintech we talked about consumers and users. In crypto it’s far more common to refer to retail participants as traders, investors or owners.  Matthew Homer, a CoinDesk columnist, is a VC investor and advisor to founders in the crypto space. He previously served as executive deputy superintendent at New York State Department of Financial Services.  I suspect this is due to several factors, but the one I’d like to focus on here is that crypto blurs boundaries. Because it can be seen as both infrastructure as well a representation of value crypto is different from what we’ve seen before.  Is the retail individual who occasionally buys and sells crypto a trader? Or is that person an investor? Or something else entirely? Noelle Acheson (the former CoinDesk head of research) does a good job breaking down what it means to be a trader in her recent “Trading Week” piece, so I’ll avoid offering any definitions.  My point is broader, crypto is definition resistant. It’s hard to pin it down as any one thing in particular. Just take the range of exchangeable assets themselves. Depending on what you're looking at, crypto has elements of commodities (like oil and gold) and securities (like stocks and bonds) as well as cash itself.  But will this polymorphic state persist or will the space eventually conform to a set of neatly defined terms, whether existing or new? I don’t know. But however we might define crypto trading (especially by the average person), there are four big questions that will shape how people are able to interact with these “assets” in the coming decades.  Who can trade?  The first question is, who will be allowed to buy or sell? There’s a lot to unpack with this question, including how the asset is regulated, where the purchase or sale takes place, etc. The question really is whether any additional rules or regulations will be put in place beyond what exists today to restrict/favor some individuals over others from buying or selling these new types of assets.  See also: How Crypto Traders Are Weathering the Bear Market  In a space that continues to evolve and calls for increasing consumer protection, principles like suitability (similar to rules defining who is a “qualified investor” in traditional investing) could apply. One effort to watch is that of Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero, who has signaled she’s interested in changing the definition of what it means to be a retail investor.  Where is crypto traded?  The second question is where is buying or selling allowed to occur? One of the most significant developments of the most recent bull market was the adoption of crypto by noncrypto-native companies. Five years ago, if you wanted to buy crypto you’d need to set up an account with a crypto-specific institution.  Today it’s possible to buy and sell crypto within many traditional fintech apps. This is significant for the crypto-curious, enabling anyone with an app like PayPal, Venmo or Square (which is a lot of people) to buy and sell on a platform they already know and trust. While the trend is toward embedding crypto into more and more non-crypto platforms, will regulators allow that to persist?  Commodities or securities?  The third question is the one that gets the most attention and therefore the one I’ll focus on the least here. That’s the question of what can be traded. Is the asset a security (like stocks and bonds), a commodity (like gold or natural gas), something in between or something entirely different? As we all know this is a matter of serious debate and, of course, it will depend on the specific asset in question.  Diminishing trading fees  The final question is how could the competitive landscape shift with greater fee competition and reduced trading volumes? Binance created a stir this summer when it announced it was eliminating trading fees on BTC. Then, a few weeks later, Coinbase responded saying it has no plans to follow suit.  In one of its recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings Coinbase reported that “trading volume decreased 53% and 34% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively,” which is significant for a firm that derives so much of its revenue from fees.  See also: Why Trading is Essential for Crypto | Opinion  Lowered trading volume combined with downward pressure on fees will push trading platforms to find new sources of profit, but what will those look like? The answer to this question likely depends on how long trading volume is depressed and whether exchanges feel the need to lower fees in order to attract new users or more volume. There are several possible business model outcomes in response to these dual pressures.  New business models  While people have been speculating about the impact of fee compression for a while, it’s possible business models would change very little if fees went to zero but similar profit was built into the spread on each trade. This might not be so different from what we’ve seen in the traditional brokerage space.  Read more: Technical Analysis Is Dead, Long Live Transaction Analysis | Opinion  We could also see exchanges add on ancillary products or services. Just as brokerages have added their own branded products like exchange-traded funds (ETF), crypto exchanges seem interested in their own branded stablecoins. A natural evolution from there is the full suite of financial services and products, ranging from credit and debit cards to transaction accounts.  Further afield, but certainly within the realm of possibility, are products and services more commercial in nature but adjacent to financial services. Imagine StubHub for non-fungible token (NFT) tickets or loyalty rewards programs for Web3 merchants.  Companies will undoubtedly pursue different strategies and, in that the boundaries will continue to blur. And as exchanges and platforms diversify their offerings, what constitutes “trading” may become even less clear than it is today.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Matthew Homer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/27/4-questions-that-will-determine-the-future-of-retail-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bf52dae8ac9da11e11118a9773d2b31da352684-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415164,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXmM7,1666875600,Crowdfunding Platform StartEngine to Acquire Rival SeedInvest From Circle,"Crowdfunding platform StartEngine said it is acquiring rival platform SeedInvest from Circle, best known for the USDC stablecoin, pending approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  “SeedInvest was acquired by Circle a few years ago, and it's one of the largest players in equity crowdfunding. We are one of the top firms in the field. By acquiring SeedInvest, it puts us in a leadership position in the marketplace by having more investors than anyone and a lot more customers, companies that need to raise capital,” StartEngine CEO Howard Marks told CoinDesk.  “Since we've had this financial crisis in the last few months, a lot of venture capitalists have stopped investing in companies that ordinarily they were already supporting,” Marks told CoinDesk, explaining the rationale of the deal. “What they're doing is helping those in their portfolio they believe are more promising and others they're not going to provide capital for, which is understandable.”  Marks believes this opens up an opportunity to raise capital for those who have a promising future but not enough support from venture capitalists. “With the acquisition of SeedInvest, we're going to almost double the number of users we have on our platform,” he said.  The price of the SeedInvest acquisition was not disclosed and Circle was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CoinDesk. Howard Marks is being advised on the deal by Kevin O’Leary, who continues to be an active investor and stakeholder in the digital assets space.  In March 2020, Circle said it was looking to sell SeedInvest, roughly a year after finalizing the buy, as it no longer fit into the company’s core stablecoin business.  ""In June this year, Circle announced to employees the plan to divest itself of SeedInvest later this year as we pivoted to focus on our core business and drive USDC adoption. As a result, Circle has decided to sell SeedInvest’s customer base to StartEngine,"" the firm said.  The SeedInvest acquisition is the second major M&A deal in the equity crowdfunding sector to occur in the last year. Last December, Republic, another equity crowdfunding platform announced that it was acquiring U.K.-based crowdfunding platform Seedrs in a deal worth $100 million (the deal was completed in September 2022). Initially, Seedrs tried to merge with another rival in the U.K called Crowdcube but that deal was blocked by the country's Competition and Markets Authority.  Trading tokenized securities in startups  During SeedInvest’s tenure with Circle, the company had announced plans to offer tokenized shares of firms listed on its platform by acquiring an alternative trading system (ATS) license. However, it’s unclear whether the plan progressed as SeedInvest still does not offer tokenized stocks in its listed companies.  Generally, the market for tokenized securities, or security token offerings (STO), is considered to be soft. In Asia, where multiple jurisdictions have approved STO frameworks, the interest hasn't materialized. In the U.S., investors have not been given them the same consideration as other digital assets, as CoinDesk has previously reported, because there's not the same efficiencies found in other crypto platforms.  StartEngine’s Marks says that the tokenized securities are in the works, post-acquisition, but it will look different than what the firm had initially proposed. Part of the reason why is that StartEngine also has an approved ATS platform, and is considered a broker-dealer, so there’s no need to duplicate efforts.  ""We have put together a plan to do what we call security tokens. SeedInvest had plans that are similar. What we're acquiring are the assets of SeedInvest – SeedInvest the name, everything. But the idea of the tokenization, that stays with Circle,"" he said.  Crowdfunding in startups  SeedInvest said that in its 10 years of operation, it has supported over 300 startups helping them raise more than $470 million from 700,000 users.  SeedInvest, Start Engine and other equity crowdfunding platforms use a framework from the Securities and Exchange Commission called RegCF that allows firms to raise up to $1 million per campaign, and $5 million annually, by selling equity to the public via SEC-registered intermediaries. Normally, companies are not allowed to solicit the sale of equity to retail investors publicly but RegCF provides an exemption.  While executives in the equity crowdfunding sector promoting it as a more ""democratic"" way to raise funds, giving retail investors a chance for exposure to high-growth tech startups that would otherwise raise behind the closed doors of traditional venture capital, data shows that the investment vehicle remains incredibly risky for retail. A case study conducted by AltFi data shows that of the first 367 companies that used the U.K.'s crowdfunding framework only 16% went on to raise additional capital at higher valuations, while only one conducted an exit – and provided a 2.5x return to investors.  Data from U.K-based Crowdcube shows that 6% of crowdfunded companies have completed a successful exit since 2011, while data from 2018 from U.S.-based crowdfunding sites show an exit rate that varies between 10%-16%. Equity crowdfunding evangelists point to high-profile exits, such as self-driving startup Cruise by General Motors (GM), or digital bank Revolut by venture capital firm DST Global as proof the fundraising category has merit.

42415169,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXmme,1666875600,"Most Crypto Scams on BNB Chain, Solidus Labs Says","Nearly 12% of all BEP-20 tokens, the standard token on BNB chain, are tied to scams, according to recently released research from crypto risk monitoring firm Solidus Labs.  “While some of the big rug pulls and scams make the news, like the famous Squid Games Token that’s estimated to have cost users around $3 million in lost funds, the full picture stemming from our data shows the vast majority of these scams go unnoticed,” Solidus Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Kathy Kraninger said in a statement. Before joining Solidus, Kraninger ran the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The research firm said it detects 15 deployed scams every hour. In the past two weeks, it has found more than 188,525 smart contracts scams across twelve major blockchains.  Aside from rug pulls, which are fairly well known in decentralized finance (DeFi), Solidus says it is seeing an increase in token impersonation scams, where a fraudulent token contract is deployed that copies a well-known token symbol to trick victims into investing.  Data released in December from Chainalysis, another crypto analytics firm, says that investors lost $2.8 billion to rug pulls during 2021.  In its release, Solidus Labs did not elaborate as to why BNB Chain has a higher percentage of contract scams than Ethereum. Its research shows that 8% of all ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum exhibit fraudulent characteristics.  In early October, BNB Chain was hit with a $100 million exploit. As Binance has close relationships with most of the chain's validators, it was able to freeze some of the stolen funds by pushing out a software update. In 2021, a company rep said that Binance is not responsible for ""rug pulls"" or fraud that occurs on-chain.  “BSC is a public permissionless infrastructure so anybody can deploy projects there,” Samy Karim, a coordinator of business and ecosystem development at Binance, said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2021. “You have malicious actors there and hacks, and exploits in DeFi are not new and definitely not unique to BSC.”  According to DeFi Llama, BNB Chain makes up 10% of all value locked in DeFi, at $5.6 billion. Ethereum, meanwhile, has 58% of the total value locked at $32 billion.

42394170,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXttz,1666874700,Bitcoin Is the Song That Does Not End,"Never mind what the naysayers are claiming about bitcoin in the midst of this down crypto market. The case for sustained bitcoin interest and continually improving fundamentals remains as sound as ever.  Recently a prominent personal finance guru, Ramit Sethi, posted the following comment on Twitter:  While I agree with his comment on passive income real estate, I feel the potshot at bitcoin is based on opinion and not steeped in the truth.  Let me provide some context and explain why I believe bitcoin interest is as strong as ever.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Three proofs of bitcoin interest  As for context, what most people need to recognize is that the monetization of bitcoin takes decades, not months.  In regards to strength in bitcoin interest, here are a few pieces of evidence:  First, I've noticed no reduction in interest in bitcoin, despite the recent price decline. Conversations are only just picking up steam as people are starting to probe into unanswered questions – questions about what money is and where the funding is for all the government spending. This became obvious to me after I was recently asked to be in a bitcoin book club with financial advisors looking to learn more about bitcoin.  Bitcoin is the song that does not end.  Second, fewer people are selling bitcoin than you may realize. Stanley Druckenmiller mentioned that when he was first interested in bitcoin, a conversation with Paul Tutor Jones helped spur his enthusiasm. A stat Paul Tutor Jones shared stuck with Druckenmiller: “Do you know that when bitcoin went from $17,000 to $3,000 that 86% of the people that owned it at $17,000 never sold it?” The comments on the acclaimed financial guru's post were also littered with comments like “I’m still here” and “Nothing has changed.”  But we have facts to back up these claims that bitcoin holding has remained steady. According to Glassnode, 78% of bitcoin’s supply hasn’t moved in six months.  Bitcoin is the song that does not end.  Third, if the “bitcoin promoters” were all gone, the hashrate would be dropping. Hashrate refers to the level of computing power given to the network through mining. Yet despite the price, the bitcoin hashrate has been making all-time highs.  There is a saying in bitcoin that miners are the most bullish bitcoiners of all. That’s because of the risks and capital outlays as well as the time it takes to plan, execute and sustain as a miner. If bitcoin was on its deathbed, the hashrate wouldn’t be climbing the way it is.  We can revisit this post 12 months from now, and the odds are that bitcoin will still be creating blocks every 10 minutes, that the hashrate will be higher, that there will still be a 21 million supply cap and that the adoption of the network will be increasing.  Bitcoin is the song that does not end.  Developer activity continues  Not only is investor interest in bitcoin still high, developer interest in crypto continues to evolve.  The builders in the crypto industry are rolling out products and services to make storing, spending and running a business on bitcoin easier. The building has been nonstop.  Read more: Bitcoin and Stocks Took a Gut Punch; the Builders Hardly Noticed  One of the most exciting things I've seen is the interest in small business owners in looking at how to accept bitcoin payments. This has always been challenging for merchants, given the challenges of confirmations and block times on the Bitcoin mainchain being approximately 10 minutes.  Here are a few projects that are working to provide solutions:  IBEX has a superb offering on Bitcoin's second layer called the Lightening Network. It allows for a plug-and-play solution enabling merchants to accept Lightening Network payments and adding margin by cutting their processing fees by 80%. By comparison, IBEX Lighting charges 0.50% and Stripe charges 2.9%, or 30 cents per swipe.  Oshi, another unique project, is helping small businesses with bitcoin rewards. It allows those businesses an easy way to start earning bitcoin and offering bitcoin rewards to customers and clients. Whether your local plumber, brewery owner, coffee shop or veterinarian, owners want new business, and Oshi's bet is that new customers desire bitcoin rewards.  Fedimint was recently released to help bridge the gap between secure but complex self-custody and simple but regulated third-party custody. The third option that this project proposes could help decentralize custody for the masses.  Bitcoin is the song that does not end.  The takeaway  The financial media and legacy gurus miss that bitcoin’s price is one thing and that the adoption story and technology around the ecosystem is another.  What they fail to recognize is that the bitcoin train has left the station – and over the long term there’s no slowing it down.  Bitcoin is the song that does not end. The promoters haven't tucked tail, but instead are holding and building for the millions to come next.

Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around $20,500 on Thursday, down slightly, while popular meme token dogecoin (DOGE) took the center stage as billionaire and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter (TWTR) approached the finish line.  Dogecoin was up 12% over the past 24 hours. Musk has been a major supporter of dogecoin, although he is being sued by a dogecoin investor for allegedly running a pyramid scheme with the coin.  Dogecoin’s move up follows bitcoin’s rally on Wednesday when it briefly touched the $21,000 mark, reaching its highest point in over a month. Ether (ETH) also reached monthly highs.  Altcoins appeared to be outperforming bitcoin on Thursday with Cosmos' ATOM up 5% and Uniswap’s UNI and Huobi’s token each up by 3%.

The nation’s gross domestic product, or GDP, rose 2.6% in the July-September period, according to a fresh report by the Commerce Department. Such growth follows a 1.6% contractions in the first quarter and 0.6% shrinkage in the second, which had prompted speculation that the economy might have entered a recession.  Analysts surveyed by FactSet had predicted a third-quarter expansion of 2%, though some closely followed economists had predicted much faster growth. Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at the forecasting firm Pantheon, had projected a rate of 3.1%.  Bitcoin was steady in the moments after the report was released, around $20,700.  Good news is bad news  While the positive number is a good sign, suggesting that activity is expanding even as costs as wages rise, it also might show that the economy can withstand further interest rate increases by the Fed.  And for most of this year, the U.S. central bank's aggressive campaign to tamp down inflation – close to a four-decade high – has weighed on valuations for risky assets, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  After several months of raising interest rates aggressively, central bankers have recently hinted at slowing down the pace of hikes after its next November meeting for fears of overtightening.  U.S. Treasury bond yields have climbed as a result of the Fed’s changes to monetary policy, which is hurting other financial markets, including crypto assets, down significantly year to date.  Over the past week, however, bitcoin (BTC) was up 5% as traders showed some relief over the prospects of slower interest rate hikes or even a potential Fed pivot. A recent move by the Bank of Canada to raise rates less robustly than expected also gave traders hope that the U.S. central bank will follow suit on Nov. 2-3.  Pantheon's Shepherdson wrote Thursday in a report that the ""all the growth"" in GDP was due to a ""huge swing in net foreign trade,"" boosted by an ""unsustainable"" 14% jump in exports and a 6.9% drop in imports.  ""The strong dollar and weak global growth will constrain future exports,"" according to Shepherdson.

42388779,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRSwJV,1666872475,UK Stablecoin Rules Approved by Lawmaker Committee,"U.K. lawmakers agreed on new rules for stablecoins on Thursday – as the government promised to consult on further crypto regulations and a digital pound in the coming weeks.  In April, Rishi Sunak – at the time finance minister, but since promoted to prime minister – said he wanted to make the U.K. a hub for crypto.  Lawmakers are now poring over government proposals to regulate stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies that seek to maintain their value against the pound or the U.S. dollar, and which can be used as a means of payment.  “Certain crypto assets and distributed ledger technology could drive transformational changes in financial markets,” recently appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith told the committee probing the Financial Services and Markets Bill, adding that there are also “risks to consumers and financial stability.”  “We wish to tentatively seize those opportunities … not fall behind other markets, but also proceeded in a cautious way,” Griffith added, referring to progress in regulating crypto in rival jurisdictions such as the U.S. and European Union.  “The government's position is to start with those most stable, least volatile coins likely to be used by intermediaries as a settlement currency and then we will go forward and consult from there,” Griffith said.  The bill also gives the U.K. Treasury powers to extend the regulatory net beyond stablecoins, if Parliament consents. Griffith said the consultation on how to do that will come out before Parliament is suspended for Christmas.  Read more: UK Lawmakers Vote to Recognize Crypto as Regulated Financial Instruments  Griffith also expressed optimism about issuing a digital pound, on which the Treasury and Bank of England are also due to consult in the coming weeks.  “It's not a trivial exercise, creating a new central bank digital currency,” Griffith said. “My own hope is that it is a ‘when,’ not an ‘if’.”  Committee lawmakers voted unanimously in favor of the new crypto measures on Thursday, but comments made by the left-wing Labour Party give a flavor of the opposition lawmakers’ approach.  Distributed ledger technology could “create high skilled, high productivity jobs across the U.K.,” said the Labour spokesperson on Treasury matters, Tulip Siddiq. She then cited recent crypto market turbulence to add that stablecoins' “instability can pose a significant risk to the public.”  “On this side of the House [of Commons], we are yet to be convinced that ministers have acknowledged the scale of the threat that the assets can pose to consumers and our constituents,” Siddiq said.  A delay to crypto laws “risks leaving our country behind in the fintech and blockchain race,” Siddiq said. “In the absence of a comprehensive regulatory regime, the U.K. risks becoming a center for illicit finance and crypto activity.”  While Griffith’s governing Conservative Party has a substantial majority of lawmakers in the House of Commons, some recent polling suggests the Labour Party could take over if a general election was called.  The bill must also be approved by the House of Lords, which is the upper house of the parliament, before it is passed into law.

NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items and can be sold or traded.  “Facebook, Instagram and Twitter all have NFT integrations, but those initiatives focus on ‘showing off’ NFTs purchased from marketplaces and adding your favorite as a profile picture,” however, Reddit’s NFT marketplace makes it a direct participant, the report said.  Read more: Reddit Users Open 2.5 Million Crypto Wallets After Launch of NFT Marketplace  Reddit’s strategy also focuses more on its community as it gives extra features to NFT owners and supports creators, the note said. It is airdropping – or giving away – NFTs to the more active users on the platform.  The role of the Polygon blockchain is also key, Coinbase said. As a layer 2 blockchain, it is compatible with Ethereum, while allowing users to transact more quickly and for lower network fees, thereby “addressing two major barriers to crypto adoption.”  Even as NFT sales volumes have plummeted this year, dropping 97% from the January peak, Reddit’s success shows the potential for these tokens, the note said. The company is likely to capitalize during the current slowdown, and has already started teasing its Halloween avatar collection, the note added.

However, this sentiment was quickly erased as the crypto market had taken a positive turn on Tuesday. By the close of the trading day on Wednesday, BTC&apos;s price had surpassed $20,000. But what does the rejection at $21,000 say? Bitcoin Fails To Beat $21,000 Even with the momentum of the past two days, bitcoin had met a harsh rejection at the $21,000 level. Bears had quickly mounted resistance at this point and the shorts in the market in anticipation of a downward correction had helped to fuel this resistance. So now, even if the outlook for bitcoin remains very bullish, $21,000 is currently the point to beat, which would be easy pickings in a bull given the recent rally. However, the crypto market has stunted the growth of digital assets, and investors remain very wary despite the market gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin&apos;s Break Above $20,000 Sees Market Liquidations Cross $1 Billion The next step would be for bulls to strengthen support at $20,500 in anticipation of the next retest. Because if bitcoin faces such a strong rejection at $21,000 once more, bears will likely try to pull the price back down to $20,000.

The firm’s Fidelity Digital Assets division will open up ether (ETH) trading for institutional clients on Oct 28. In late September Fidelity launched a new Ethereum Index Fund for accredited investors that raised nearly $5 million in less than two weeks.  The firm continues to combine its institutional investor and crypto interests with the new fourth annual Fidelity Digital Assets Institutional Investor Digital Assets Study. More than half of those surveyed (58%) had invested in digital assets during the first half of 2022 and 74% planned to invest in the future, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk.  The survey was conducted between Jan. 2 and June 24 this year, covering the shift from the bull to bear market, and included 1,052 institutional investors spread across the U.S., Europe and Asia. The respondents included family offices, digital and traditional hedge funds, pension, financial advisers, endowments and foundations, and high net worth individuals.  “The increased adoption reflected in the data speaks to a strong first half of the year for the digital assets industry,” said Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets. ”While the markets have faced headwinds in recent months, we believe that digital assets fundamentals remain strong and that the institutionalization of the market over the past several years has positioned it to weather recent events,”  The groups with the highest rate of digital asset investments at 87% were crypto hedge funds and venture capital funds who would naturally have a bullish stance on the market. The next highest crypto investor groups were high net worth individuals and financial advisers.  Digital assets ownership was highest among respondents in Asia at 69% followed by Eruope (67%) and the U.S. (42%) with the latter two regions seeing an 11-point and 9-point increase, respectively, compared to the 2021 survey.  The overwhelming majority (88%) of the investors found digital assets appealing due to factors such as the high potential upside, the technology innovation and decentralization. Those refraining from crypto investments cited price volatility and security concerns among the reasons.

42388789,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRSx4H,1666866844,"As Bitcoin Teases 100-Day Average, Prominent Traders Say Latest Crypto Bounce Looks More Constructive Than August","Risk assets seem to be breaking out bullishly, with bitcoin challenging its 100-day simple moving average (SMA) that aborted the August rally.  The resistance at $20,882 could be convincingly toppled this time, as prominent traders think the latest market bounce is more long-lasting than the one seen two months ago.  ""It's a bit more constructive than August, as we're more removed from the Three Arrows Capital and Celsius [Network] and Terra events, and many more bitcoin miners have liquidated their position,"" Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime, said.  ""So supply overhang in BTC should be less, and firms a bit more comfortable redeploying capital now that the dust has settled, and the [Federal Reserve] has gotten a few [interest rate] raises out of the way since,"" Tang added.  The chart from Arcane Research and Luxor shows public miners have slowed their coin sales since June when they ran down their bitcoin inventory by liquidating 350% of the mined coins.  Last month, miners liquidated only 68% of the coins produced, weakening the sell-side pressure in the market.  The market no longer seems hungover from the collapse of Terra's, Three Arrows Capital, and crypto lender Celsius as it was three months ago and grown resilient to negative headlines. Bitcoin remained flat early this month despite reports that U.S. federal agencies are probing Three Arrows for various possible legal violations.  Liquid staking protocol Lido's staked ether (stETH) token has recently caught up with ether's spot price, erasing the discount in another sign that gloomy summer days are behind us.  Besides, the latest crypto market bounce comes on the back of material evidence that the Federal Reserve may be close to slowing the pace of liquidity tightening as opposed to early August when equity and crypto markets ran ahead of themselves in pricing the so-called Fed pivot.  Last week, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the central bank should avoid pushing the economy into an ""unforced downturn by raising rates too sharply. Daly added that it's time to start discussing slowing the pace of tightening. Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Timiraos published an article last Friday hinting the Fed could slow the pace of rate hikes to 50 basis points in December.  The bond market seems to be in agreement with the crypto market. The U.S. Treasury yields, which remained elevated in August, contradicting the Fed pivot hopes in crypto and equity markets, have dropped sharply this week, confirming the bounce in risk assets. The 10-year yield has declined by 30 basis points to 4% since Friday and the two-year yield, which is more sensitive to rate hike expectations, has dropped by 20 basis points to 4.43%.  ""Markets have leaned optimistic for most of the year, only to be served a reality check by monthly economic data prints fueling continued Fed hawkishness. However, tides are potentially slowly starting to turn, with the Fed hinting at a potential slowing of rate hikes, not an outright pivot,"" Josh Olszweicz, head of research at digital asset fund manager Valkyrie Investments told CoinDesk, noting the weakness in yields and the dollar index.  Wes Hansen, director of trading and operations at crypto fund Arca, said, ""The news out Friday that the Fed was likely to begin easing up on the rate hikes, along with the growing chorus of investors, politicians and international agencies to do this, has led to a changing macro picture for the markets.""  ""I would find it hard to justify that this is the end to the bear market, but there were some real market changes that led to this rally,"" Hansen noted, adding that the scenario where inflation cools, allowing the Fed to pivot could be near.  Data from Pantheon Macroeconomics and macro trader Geo Chen's substack post shows that shelter inflation, the largest component of the U.S. consumer price index, could soon turn from a headwind to a drag on headline inflation.  ""A dramatically declining CPI will provide evidence for a less hawkish Fed going forward. Any signs of slowing the pace of hikes will likely be seen as incredibly bullish by risk-on market participants,"" Valkyrie's Olszewicz said.  The Fed is widely expected to deliver its fourth consecutive 75 basis point interest rate hike on Nov. 2, lifting the benchmark interest rate to the 3.75%-4% range.  The U.S. third quarter GDP, due later Thursday, the core personal consumption expenditure scheduled for release on Friday, and the Nov. 10 CPI reading could influence Fed expectations and bring volatility to asset markets.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/27/as-bitcoin-probes-100-day-average-prominent-traders-say-latest-crypto-bounce-looks-more-constructive-than-august,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1631c117b9e51d550fbf979d4cb5cea42becb769-3028x1516.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The warning sent its shares down 77% to as low as 23 U.S. cents.  The miner said it anticipates existing cash resources will be depleted by the end of the year, possibly sooner.  ""Substantial doubt exists about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time,"" it said in a filing Thursday.  The miner is exploring a number of strategic alternatives for raising additional capital. It has hire engaged Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP as legal advisers and PJT Partners LP as financial advisers.  Should the capital raise alternatives fail, the firm may have to file for bankruptcy protection, Core Scientific said.  The Austin, Texas-based company will not make payments due in late October and early November 2022 with respect to several of its equipment and other financings, it said in the filing. Creditors may decide to sue the company for non-payment or take action with respect to collateral, it said.  ""With the substantial decline in mining rig prices in 2022, we believe there's a significant chance the creditors holding this debt decide to restructure instead of taking possession of the collateral,"" Compass Point said in a note. ""Still, without knowing how discussions are going with CORZ's creditors, we think a scenario where CORZ has to file for Chapter 11 protection has to be taken seriously, especially if BTC prices decline further from current levels.""  BTIG cut the stock to neutral from buy: ""We expect this liquidity overhang to prevent CORZ from expanding its hash capacity and delay the company's ability to secure new hosting customers, which clouds the company's near-term growth prospects,"" the investment bank said.  Core Scientific's woes reflect the depressed state of the bitcoin mining industry, with firms squeezed between high electricity costs and a muted bitcoin price. One of Core Scientific's peers, Compute North, filed for bankruptcy in September owing as much as $500 million to at least 200 creditors.  Bitcoin touched an all-time high of almost $70,000 in November last year. Since then the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value has slumped, dropping to below $20,000 in June. Since then, it has stubbornly hung around the $20,000 level, meaning miners have struggled to break even.

Bankman-Fried said in the interview ""it is very likely"" FTX will create a stablecoin, a crypto token whose value is tied to that of another asset. The exchange knows how to create one and is thinking about the best partner to work with, he said. He also hinted that an announcement will come soon.  However, in a follow-up tweet on Friday, Bankman-Fried noted that FTX is still determining a potential pathway.  ""Eh to clarify: we are figuring out what we're doing on stablecoins; it could be anything or nothing, and could *or could not* involve partnerships, issuance, hula hoops, etc. (One of those is less likely than the others.),"" he tweeted.  FTX currently offers margin trading that allows customers to use a basket of U.S. dollar stablecoins as collateral. The basket includes trueUSD (TUSD), USD coin (USDC), Pax dollar (USDP), HUSD and Binance USD (BUSD). Rival exchange Binance started issuing Binance USD in 2019.  The rise of tether (USDT), which is the largest stablecoin and has a market cap of $68 billion, also provides a use-case of how stablecoins can thrive even under regulatory scrutiny. Tether is owned by iFinex, a Hong Kong holding company that also owns crypto exchange Bitfinex.  FTX has been spending during the current bear market, making several large acquisitions including a deal to buy crypto lending business BlockFi for up to $240 million. While Bankman-Fried bought a 7.6% stake in retail trading app Robinhood (HOOD) in May, FTX is not interested in acquiring the entire company, he said in the interview.  FTX did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  UPDATE (Oct. 27, 11:38 UTC): Adds interview detail in second paragraph.

As NewsBTC reported, the price rally started shortly after the Dollar Index (DXY) showed weakness and suffered a sharp setback. For much of 2022, Bitcoin and the dollar index were inversely correlated. While the DXY was rising relentlessly and all fiat currencies around the world were depreciating, the USD was gaining massive strength. However, this trend was also extremely negative for the Bitcoin price, as a strong USD meant a weak Bitcoin. The inverse correlation was seen again on Tuesday. A prolonged period of weakness for the DXY could thus mean further momentum for the bitcoin market, which has a short-term bullish bias. In this respect, today (Thursday) is an important day for the Bitcoin market, as both the European Central Bank (ECB) will report on its future policies and the American GDP figures will be released.

42388781,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRSwOB,1666858973,Crypto Predictions Site Polymarket Foresees Republicans Winning Both Senate and House,"Cryptocurrency predictions site Polymarket has started its 2022 Midterms Live Forecast and is predicting Republicans will comfortably control both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.  The site is giving an overall 64% chance of Republicans taking control of Congress, and 87% chance of them winning the House, indicating Democrats could be in for a rude shock. According to the site, the tightest Senate races will be in the states of Arizona (Democrats having a 51% chance of winning), Georgia (Republicans having a 52% chance of winning), and Pennsylvania (Republicans edging out with a 63% chance of winning).  Polymarket lets people trade on the likelihood of future events in real-time as a tamper-proof smart contract on an Ethereum layer 2 platform.  So far midterms-related trading has resulted in a volume of $2 million and liquidity of $500,000. The 2022 U.S. midterm elections will be held on Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2022, in which all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 35 of the 100 Senate seats will be contested.  ""Time and time again, prediction markets prove more accurate than traditional polls and pundits,"" tweeted Shayne Coplan, CEO of Polymarket HQ. ""Yet the true value comes from generating unbiased forecasts as a public good,"" he added.  In January, Polymarket was fined $1.4 million and ordered to cease its offering by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The predictions site then gave access to only non-U.S. users.  The site has also accepted bets on “Will Russia use a nuclear weapon before 2023?” following increased calls by Russian authorities to utilize such weapons. The odds offered then was 17 to 1, meaning you'd win $17 for every $1 you bet. On the other hand, betting correctly on ""No"" would win you $1.06 for every $1 you bet. This translates to a 6% probability of Russia using a nuke this year.  The site is also taking bets on the question of ""who will win the U.S. 2024 Republican presidential nomination?"", with Donald Trump leading the pack.

Over the last 24 hours, BTC gained more than 7% on its chart. In the last week, the crypto&apos;s gain has been more than 8%. This has put Bitcoin in a bullish position as it has managed to cross the $20,000 price mark. The buyers are back on the one-day chart as the demand for the coin noted a considerable increase. The bulls might be eyeing the next major resistance mark of $22,000, but there are two other important price levels that the coin has to zoom past. If the buyers once again exit the market, a price pullback is on the chart. This change in the bullish momentum of Bitcoin has also fueled massive rallies for major altcoins in the market. The next immediate trading sessions will prove to be vital for the coin as they could decide the further strength of the bulls. A fall from the current price mark will bring BTC back to the $19,000 price zone. Bitcoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart BTC was trading at $20,800 at the time of writing.
