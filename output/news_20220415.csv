54613,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=231584,1650064518,What Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Means for Tether,"For those unfamiliar, Tether (USDT) is a U.S. Dollar stablecoin. It exists outside the current financial system and is transferred over cryptocurrency networks. Tether is centralized because a firm that maintains a reserve of USD and other assets (including bitcoin) manages it. They back each Tether 1:1 with a USD counterpart. For years, the U.S. government has been after Tether. This is because they have successfully run outside of the regular system while supplying people worldwide. All of this is to imply that people would only hold Tether if it were necessary to conduct a transaction. Having said that, there is little question that Tether is in high demand throughout the world. More so, as people try to avoid the short-term bitcoin&apos;s price volatility. Many users in developing countries don&apos;t have the luxury of sitting back and stomaching bitcoin&apos;s rollercoaster price changes. So, they store some of their holdings in stablecoins. By doing this, they do not have to worry about not being able to purchase what they want when they want to spend. Leveraging on the Omni Layer Protocol What&apos;s remarkable about Synonym&apos;s Tether implementation on Lightning Network is that it uses the Omni Layer protocol. Tether&apos;s first introduction was to this protocol. As on-chain fees rose in the subsequent years, there was a shift from Tether usage to other chains. The reason for this was to take advantage of their lower fees. Since then, it&apos;s bee...",NEUTRAL,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/what-bitcoins-lightning-network-means-for-tether/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-bitcoins-lightning-network-means-for-tether,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

54625,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=231768,1650059116,Ziliqa Price Prediction in 2022,"It&apos;s no secret that cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. But what does the future hold for Ziliqa? Will the price go up or down? In this article, we&apos;ll take a look at some of the factors that could influence zilliqa price in the future and predict the price in 2022. One of the most important factors that will affect Ziliqa&apos;s price is its adoption rate. The more people use and accept Ziliqa, the higher its price will go. We can see this with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Another factor that could affect Ziliqa&apos;s price is the development of its technology. If Ziliqa&apos;s still continues to improve the platform and make it more user-friendly, this will also boost its price. Finally, geopolitical factors could also have an impact on Ziliqa&apos;s price. For example, if there is more uncertainty in the world (such as a trade war or a financial crisis), people may turn to cryptocurrencies as a safe haven asset. This could drive up the price of Ziliqa. Taking all of these factors into account, our prediction for Ziliqa&apos;s price in 2022 is $5.00. However, it&apos;s important to remember that cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile and can move up or down very quickly. So, this is just a prediction and not investment advice. What is Ziliqa?

Nobody can dispute that Shiba Inu has made significant strides in the past year. Since late 2020, the cryptocurrency has undergone a staggering gain of more than 41,000,000% in value as a result of its ability to capture the attention of investors. This cryptocurrency, also known as the Dogecoin killer, was created in August 2020 by a founder who goes by Ryoshi with the aim of overtaking Dogecoin as the most popular meme coin, and it has definitely proven to be much more than your conventional meme coin. Since it is built as an ERC-20 on top of Ethereum&apos;s blockchain, unlike Dogecoin, which can only be used as a digital currency due to having a code that is similar to Bitcoin, Shiba Inu can be used to create much more advanced applications, such as decentralized exchanges and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The SHIB meme coin surpassed Dogecoin as the most valued meme currency in November 2021 and it had a price of $0.00008845 when it hit its all-time high. Is the Hype Cooling Off?

42423524,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aWXh,1650054480,"Market Wrap: Cryptos Mixed Amid NFT Slowdown, Meme Coins Surge","The Market Wrap team is out of the office on Friday because it's a CoinDesk company holiday, with most traditional markets closed in the U.S.  For the latest cryptocurrency prices, please go here, and for the latest news headlines, please go here.  Even so, we worked in advance to put together some reading for the long weekend, including:  Technical insight on bitcoin (BTC) based on a one-week timeline for a longer-term view of how the charts are looking.  An exploration by CoinDesk's Angelique Chen of a new claim against OpenSea, amid uncertainty over the non-fungible token trading platform's reimbursement policy.  In the meantime, please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Technical insight  Bitcoin Neutral, Support at $37K and Resistance at $46K  Bitcoin (BTC) wavered this week, showing uncertainty among market participants.  Most technical indicators are neutral, although short-term buyers could remain active between the $35,000-$37,000 support zone, similar to what occurred earlier this year.  Momentum signals, according to the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicator, are positive on the weekly chart and negative on the monthly chart. That suggests a period of range-bound price action could persist, albeit with an average price swing of 20%.  On the weekly chart, the 100-week moving average, now at $35,388, is an important gauge of trend support. Buyers will need to keep BTC above that level in order to sustain a recovery.  Still, there is strong resistance at the 40-week moving average of $46,800.  An upside target of $50,966 was within close distance on March 28, but the price pulled back, like it did last September.  For now, bullish countertrend signals will need to be confirmed with weekly price closes above $40,000.  NFT slowdown emanating from hacks  OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, has faced several lawsuits following hacks on its platform. Jimmy McKimmy, an NFT owner from Texas, sued OpenSea for the recovery of more than a $1 million loss of his stolen NFT, Bored Ape #3475.  Hacks have led to more uncertainty in the NFT community, which could be the source of slowing demand in recent months.  McKimmy is not alone with his hefty loss. OpenSea recently issued around $1.8 million in refunds to users whose NFTs were stolen. Still, OpenSea's policy on such reimbursements is unclear at the moment. The platform requires users to connect their accounts to a wallet, which means others can see unlisted NFTs and make potential offers for those assets. In McKimmy's case, the hacker made an offer, hacked the code, accepted the offer for McKimmy and then resold the NFT.  Earlier this month, OpenSea's Discord account was hacked and posted a phishing link disguised as a ""stealth NFT mint"" and was used to steal the NFT Mutant Ape Yacht Club #8662 from a user. Similar incidents kindled comments on Twitter and caused a slowdown of NFT trades overall.  Altcoin roundup  This week's winners (through Thursday)  SHIB and DOGE: Popular dog-themed meme coins SHIB and DOGE rallied by as much as 20% over the past 30 days. The rise in prices mostly followed the broader crypto recovery that was led by alternative cryptos, indicating a greater appetite for risk among traders. Also, earlier this month, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said he is not selling his crypto holdings, which included DOGE.  This week's losers (through Thursday)  WAVES and LUNA: 20% price drops in WAVES and LUNA detracted from broader crypto market gains over the past week.

And Terra's LUNA token declined, even though the Luna Foundation Guard has been busy accumulating BTC for its reserves.  News Insight  Bitcoin's mining pool concentration  A handful of mining pools control too much hashrate (computational power used to mine and process transactions on a blockchain), which could pose a threat to bitcoin's decentralization, according to CoinDesk's Aoyon Ashraf.  ""Mining pools are, by definition, a centralizing force in the bitcoin mining ecosystem,"" Jurica Bulovic, head of mining pool Foundry, said. ""They provide a service of aggregating hashrate from individual miners in order to minimize the inherent revenue volatility, and provide stable payouts."" Foundry is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk's parent company.  Read more: What are Bitcoin Mining Pools?  Foundry USA is the largest bitcoin pool in the world, with almost 20% of the total network's hashrate, according to BTC.com data as of March 25.  That concentration may seem like another threat to the decentralization thesis. Mining pools, however, don't control the network and don't have a lot of clout, because any miner can quickly change pools if there is any hint of foul play, such as censoring bitcoin transactions, Bulovic said.

42423520,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aWRh,1650052549,Sanctioned Crypto Wallet Linked to North Korean Hackers Keeps Laundering,"An alleged North Korean Ethereum wallet tied to March’s $600 million crypto hack continues to launder its stolen ether (ETH) Friday in defiance of U.S. sanctions.  The blacklisted address that U.S. authorities say is controlled by North Korea’s elite “Lazarus” hacker group sent 2,915 ETH (around $8.8 million) to the cleaners this morning New York time, a day after federal officials listed it on its sanctions database.  Making a brief pit stop at a fresh, unsanctioned wallet, its crypto quickly flew through the popular coin mixer Tornado Cash, where the trail went cold.  It was a continuation of what one tracing expert told CoinDesk is a brute-force laundering strategy tailored for speed – even at the expense of some of the treasure. One month after draining the Ronin Bridge of over $600 million in crypto, the hackers are pushing their trove through Tornado Cash, about $10 million at a time.  Tracing company Elliptic on Thursday estimated the Ronin hackers have laundered $80 million through Tornado Cash. Friday morning’s transactions likely add at least another $8 million to this sum. It’s unclear how much Lazarus can successfully launder for its own purposes.  Open book  Ethereum’s transparent transaction ledger reveals the gambit.  For the last 10 days, the “Ronin Bridge Exploit” address has sent multimillion-dollar batches of ETH to intermediary wallets for processing through Tornado Cash. It moves fast, depositing 100 ETH tranches into Tornado Cash in a matter of hours and abandoning the relatively small sums that remain.  Read more: Tornado Cash Adds Chainalysis Tool for Blocking OFAC-Sanctioned Wallets From Dapp  Shortly after Friday morning’s mix, Tornado Cash tweeted it uses a data feed from Chainalysis to “block [Office of Foreign Assets Control] sanctioned addresses from accessing the dapp.”  CoinDesk has not been able to confirm when the oracle integration went live. Either way, it only affects Tornado Cash’s front end, meaning savvy users can still interact with the smart contracts powering the decentralized service. The primary wallet hasn’t attempted to move funds through Tornado Cash since that tweet, but the operators of the sanctioned wallet only seem to send funds once a day.  Neither fact would make much of a difference for Lazarus’ laundering. Chainalysis added one wallet – the sanctioned “Ronin Bridge Exploit” address – to its free-to-use oracle service yesterday, and not the intermediary addresses the hackers are using.  A representative for Chainalysis said the company provides more comprehensive compliance tools with its paid products. Sources familiar with Tornado Cash did not respond. A Tornado Cash founder said on Twitter Friday that Chainalysis didn’t get back to him about the paid offering.  The U.S. Treasury Department said the wallet was linked to Lazarus Group on Thursday, but the FBI did not confirm until later in the day that federal officials believed the North Korean hacking group was directly responsible for compromising the Axie Infinity-linked Ronin bridge.  “Through our investigation we were able to confirm Lazarus Group and APT38, cyber actors associated with the DPRK, are responsible for the theft of $620 million in Ethereum reported on March 29,” the FBI said in a statement.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ASIA | AXS | ETH | REGULATION | WALLET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/15/sanctioned-crypto-wallet-linked-to-north-korean-hackers-keeps-on-laundering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20e52cd17c5b4d89e00d363a6e576a9ea678e207-4961x3507.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading | Price Analysis: Where&apos;s XRP Headed After Ripple&apos;s Big Win Initially, the battle was expected to be an easy win for the regulators. This had a negative impact on the price of XRP, the cryptocurrency that powers the XRP Ledger, and some of the products from the payment company. However, Ripple has been using its resources and appears to be turning the table in its favor. In court, the payment solution company has presented evidence that claims the SEC was made aware of XRP, and Ripple&apos;s business model with the cryptocurrency using a product called Ripple Network. The evidence goes as back as 2013 and includes documents that suggest the SEC failed to provide clarity over the digital asset&apos;s classification as a security. According to legal experts, the evidence could demonstrate to the court that Ripple was actively seeking to remain compliant with U.S. securities law. In that sense, Garlinghouse told CNBC the following on his perception of the status of the case: The lawsuit has gone exceedingly well, and much better than I could have hoped when it began about 15 months ago.

One of the sharpest supporters of Musk buying Twitter and turning it decentralized came from the Elrond CEO Beniamin Mincu, Will Twitter Have a Decentralized Future? In a newly added speculation and conversations surrounding Elon Musk&apos;s hostile takeover to buy Twitter, Elrond CEO Mincu too added his own views on what he thought of the initiative by Musk to buy Twitter. Mincu started off his tweet saying that the social network platform is the &apos;Defacto Town Square for the world&apos;. Traditionally, Town Square is described as an open public space where people gather to discuss, meet and gather and be entertained. That essentially means that in the current times, Twitter is the town square of the world. Mincu then explicitly called out the SpaceX and Tesla CEO to buy the company in order to make it open-source and decentralized. Twitter has effectively become the defacto Town Square for the world. It is important for humanity that free speech be preserved, and twitter&apos;s potential be unlocked.

Our main scenario, which we published in the previous article, is working out perfectly and step by step. The first target is a test of $0.08 was implemented by buyers. During the 2 trading weeks, buyers were able to raise the VET price by almost 100%. For a while, the VET price rose above $0.08. However, buyers failed to close the 28 March trading week with confidence. As a result, the expected local price rebound began. https://www.tradingview.com/x/PgCFzhdU/ The main target of buyers to complete the formation of the reversal pattern in the VET market is to keep the range of $0.055. By implementing this plan on a weekly timeframe, market participants will receive a concrete signal of the weakness of sellers and the readiness of the price for a rapid growth wave. The first global target of such a growth wave is $0.124. This mark will show how buyers are ready to break the global downward trend from April 2021. While this mark is under the control of sellers, it is too early to talk about updating the historical high and a new raid of buyers. However, the price growth from $0.055 to $0.124 is a pretty good medium-term trade in the current realities of the cryptocurrency market.

A close below this week&apos;s lows may see the coin drop towards Q1 2022 lows of $18—and worse if bears add to their shorts. Past Performance of NEO NEO is flat-lining at spot rates, down six percent in the past trading week versus the USDT. The candlestick formation in the daily chart shows that the coin has posted higher highs versus the lower BB. However, prices are still within the April 11 bear engulfing bar. Therefore, while buyers are upbeat, the setup points to sellers in the immediate term. NEO Technical Analysis From an effort versus results perspective, sellers have the upper hand provided prices are within the April 11 bear bar. The immediate resistance level is $21, flashing with the April 11 highs. A close above this mark with rising volumes may be the base for a leg up towards $26. As per the formation in the daily chart, aggressive sellers can unload on pullbacks with targets at $19—April 11 lows—and later $18—March 2022 lows. What to Expect from NEO? Technically, NEO is bearish. Still, the higher highs from April 13 and the failure of bears to confirm sharp losses of early this week may be interpreted as positive.

As long as prices are below $0.21, sellers are in the driving seat. A close above March lows may see the coin rally to $0.28. Past Performance GALA is still within a bear breakout formation following losses of late last week. Overall, the path of least resistance is down. The token is down nine percent in the previous week of trading. Sellers have the upper hand as long as prices are below March 2022 lows of around $0.21. GALA Technical Analysis The coin is within a bear breakout formation. Notably, the April 11 bear candlestick defines the short and medium-term formation. With clear resistance at $0.21—coinciding with the April 11 high—and bulls unable to unwind losses, risk-off traders can unload on every attempt to retest $0.21. Eventual losses below $0.19 and April 11 lows may see a sell-off, forcing the coin towards $0.16—Q1 2022 lows. Conversely, a high volume spike above $0.21 may signal the end of the bear run, paving the way back to March 2022 highs of around $0.28. What to Expect from GALA?

Looking at the ICP market situation, the word success is clearly too early to use. The global downward trend, in which the ICP price has been moving since September 2021, has been maintained by sellers. For three weeks, buyers have been trying to reverse this trend. However, during the trading week on 28 March, sellers clearly showed their dominance. With the help of limit orders, sellers extinguished all the passion of buyers at local highs. https://www.tradingview.com/x/aFW2PTLm/ Thus, a small weekly candle was formed with the highest trading volumes in 3 weeks. The local culmination of purchases showed the unwillingness of ICP buyers to start a new growth wave. During the week of 4 April, sellers leveled almost all the success of buyers in three weeks. This fact shows the inability to keep the price and redeem the offer of sellers. At the time of writing, sellers are testing a $15.7 critical mark. Buyers managed to repel the first attack, but there is no confidence and desire to seize the initiative. If the weekly candle of 11 April closes below the $15.7 mark, we will expect the ICP price to continue falling with a maximum target of $10. To realize such a negative scenario, the Bitcoin market must fall below $38,000.

Even with new highs, the rally is largely viewed as a failure without a dramatic cycle conclusion. But what if that rally was part of a bear phase, that only now is about to end? In a new direct comparison between bear phases in Bitcoin since 2018, it could indicate that it is almost time for another bull season any day now.

42423515,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aWHh,1650034631,Biden Nominates Former Ripple Adviser Barr as Top US Fed Regulator,"U.S. President Joe Biden named former crypto industry adviser Michael Barr as his latest pick for a Federal Reserve post that's arguably the most powerful financial regulatory job in the U.S.  Michael Barr, who is now the public policy school dean at the University of Michigan Law School, was a senior official in former President Barack Obama's Treasury Department and occupied a key role in the government's rescue of the financial system from the ruins of the 2008 financial crisis. But the most important aspect of his background for the digital-assets industry could potentially be his tenure on the board of advisers at Ripple, giving him an insider's knowledge of crypto.  The White House announced Barr's selection as the next nominee for the Fed's vice chairman for supervision on Friday, praising him as a person who ""spent his career protecting consumers."" But he'll face a Senate confirmation minefield that already eliminated Biden's previous choice, Sarah Bloom Raskin.  The official announcement didn't mention Barr's background with the financial industry, which also included a stint at financial-technology platform Lending Club. Barr was hired in 2015 on the board of Ripple Labs, when he said that he thought ""innovation in payments can help make the financial system safer, reduce cost, and improve access and efficiency for consumers and businesses alike.”  It was that industry experience that previously soured progressive groups on Barr, who had been an early Biden administration favorite to run the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. That candidacy was derailed by opposition from the left, and the post remains vacant after some senators vehemently opposed another candidate.  In the evenly divided Senate, Republicans have campaigned vigorously against some of Biden's regulatory nominations, leaving Barr's eventual confirmation in some question. Though he's previously won bipartisan support in that chamber, he could be on a more difficult road this time.  If he's confirmed, he'll occupy a leadership role in the multi-agency efforts already underway to regulate stablecoins and to consider further guardrails for the rest of the crypto industry.  Barr is generally considered a consumer-friendly advocate for aggressive financial oversight, with deep experience in financial-inclusion efforts. He co-authored the book ""Insufficient Funds,"" about the finances of poor families in Detroit, and wrote ""No Slack: The Financial Lives of Low-Income Americans."" The Treasury veteran also helped craft the same Dodd-Frank Act that established the vice chairman role that Barr is seeking.  In a statement, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said, ""I will support this key nominee, and I strongly urge my Republican colleagues to abandon their old playbook of personal attacks and demagoguery and put Americans and their pocketbooks first.""

42423514,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aWJh,1650031437,Tornado Cash Adds Chainalysis Tool for Blocking OFAC-Sanctioned Wallets From Dapp,"In a move that raised the eyebrows of crypto privacy wonks, coin mixer Tornado Cash said Friday it is using a tool developed by compliance firm Chainalysis to block crypto wallets sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  However, the blockade only applies to the user-facing decentralized application (dapp), not the underlying smart contract, one of the protocol's founders later tweeted.  The coin mixer, which claims to defend people's financial privacy, has often been used to obfuscate the trail of crypto obtained through hacks.  The protocol's founder has previously said it is ""technically impossible"" to enforce sanctions on decentralized protocols like Tornado Cash. ""There's not much we can do,"" he said in a March interview.  Read more: Tornado Cash Co-Founder Says the Mixer Protocol Is Unstoppable  The half-measure of restricting front-end access is not new, however.  A former U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency agent told CoinDesk in January that Tornado Cash complies with OFAC's list of sanctioned crypto wallets. The announcement Friday follows Thursday's news that North Korean hackers were alleged by U.S. authorities to be behind the $625 million exploit of Axie Infinity's Ronin blockchain.  The Ronin hackers ""have so far sent $80.3 million worth of ETH through Tornado Cash,"" tracing firm Elliptic wrote Thursday.  ""The fact that Tornado Cash doesn't allow access to its app to comply with regulations doesn't necessarily mean that the protocol and smart contracts are not available to the sanctioned entities,"" Tal Be'ery, the chief technology officer of crypto wallet ZenGo, told CoinDesk in a direct message.  OFAC is a U.S. government body responsible for enforcing economic sanctions to support national security and foreign policy. It maintains a list of crypto wallets tied to sanctioned individuals and entities.  The Chainalysis oracle for sanctions compliance is a free smart contract that scans for crypto wallets that are sanctioned by various governments. The sanctions-screening tool was launched in March against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

42394231,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaTZ1,1650030384,The US and Europe Can't Regulate Crypto Alone,"Crypto is keeping lawmakers busy on both sides of the Atlantic.  They really should be working together – and, for that matter, with other legislators around the world. When you’re dealing with a technology that pays scant regard for borders, a more borderless approach is needed.  In the past month, U.S. senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) announced their co-sponsorship of comprehensive crypto legislation, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) filed a detailed proposal for regulating stablecoins, and five Democratic congressmen introduced the Electronic Currency and Secure Hardware (ECASH) Act. to develop a cash-like digital dollar.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Meanwhile, in Brussels, the European Union’s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislative framework has moved to “trilogue” discussions among the European Parliament, Council and Commission, with the goal being a single model for licensing providers of crypto asset services that “passportable” across all 27 EU member states. After a knife-edge vote last month, the bill was stripped of draconian provisions that would have prohibited proof-of-work mining on environmental grounds and is now heavily focused on stablecoins.  From the crypto community’s perspective, there are pros and cons in these different U.S. and European approaches. But it all could be a moot point. Developments outside of the big Western economies are a reminder that crypto is global by nature and will grow wherever it faces the least resistance. That raises huge implications for whatever decisions to control or manage the industry are taken in Europe and the U.S.  Global adoption  In Africa, for example, a partnership between mega crypto exchange FTX and Nairobi-based AZA Finance is poised to open a network of on- and off-ramps for Africans using a variety of national currencies to engage with Web 3 commerce and systems.  This comes as crypto activity in Africa is booming. According to Chainalysis’s 2021 global crypto adoption index, Kenya and Nigeria – with a combined population of around 260 million people – were ranked fifth and sixth in the world, respectively. As of June last year, Nigeria was the biggest market for Paxful, a leader in peer-to-peer crypto payments, accounting for 1.5 million users. And as we learned in an episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcast last year, crypto innovation hubs are thriving in Lagos, Kenya, Johannesburg and Cape Town, with decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects taking off everywhere.  Meanwhile, the biggest exchanges are rushing to set up shop in the Middle East. Binance recently obtained relatively liberal licenses to operate in Bahrain and Dubai and has received an approval in principle to operate as a broker-dealer in Abu Dhabi, with new accommodative laws being established in the United Arab Emirates. Around the same time, FTX got a Dubai license.  And let's not forget what’s happening in Ukraine. Even before the Russian invasion, which prompted an unprecedented inflow of crypto funds into Ukraine to support both the war effort and humanitarian causes, Ukraine was a world leader in adoption. Now, with President Zelenskyy hurrying through a new law legalizing cryptocurrencies, it is now perhaps the world leader in crypto usage.  Crypto is a slippery target for regulators  If you’re a crypto developer, these places are where the action is right now. Not only are they friendlier regimes, but the rapid pace of adoption there is creating a virtuous circle of growth that’s encouraging developers to offer profitable crypto services.  And because digitally nomadic developer teams don’t even need to physically move to such places to take advantage of these opportunities, the speed with which they are seized upon is very fast indeed.  What this means is that, independently of efforts by the U.S. and EU to contain and manage the development of cryptocurrency services, the wider ecosystem around crypto will continue to develop and grow.  Whether it does so in a way that is beneficial to the U.S. or EU is by no means assured, however.  Indeed, the argument that killed the attempt to impose an EU ban on proof-of-work mining was that it would create opportunities for greenhouse gas-producing energy providers to woo bitcoin miners to their locations – Kazakhstan’s coal-based mining boom being a case in point. If the goal of regulation is to achieve some benefit for the world at large – which is the case for any climate-related rules – then its designers have to be wary of such perverse outcomes.  International approach  Regulating bankers is comparatively easy. By definition they need a license, their very existence defined by their relationship to the central bank’s monetary provisions. Take the license away and the entity is literally no longer a bank.  It’s much harder to regulate open-source developers, especially if they aren’t paid by a centralized company per se but instead are remunerated by the open network they serve with tokens generated and issued by a protocol. While there are concerted efforts by policy designers in the U.S. and Europe to impose licensing constraints on DeFi coders – we addressed one example last week – it’s very difficult to force people who can be anywhere and who are answerable only to themselves not to write open-source code.  I’m not arguing that crypto projects should not be regulated, by the way. There’s a real societal interest in trying to steer such projects toward the protection of a public good. It’s just that regulating crypto needs a more nuanced, accommodative and, most importantly, internationally coordinated approach if it is to be effective.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Michael J.

Among the few barriers to entry that linger in the crypto space for newbies, price fluctuation (volatility) is a key hurdle to overcome. To put this in perspective, cryptocurrencies can fluctuate in price by upwards of 16% in a single day! What if there was a form of money that was as stable as regular fiat currency but can still be used as a cryptocurrency? This would solve several challenges like not having to liquidate all holdings to your bank account and possibly being liable to pay a higher short-term gain tax. For those reasons, and more, &apos;stablecoins&apos; came into existence. What Are Stablecoins? Stablecoin is very much like a regular cryptocurrency but with a stable value. That means while a stablecoin lives on a blockchain, can be decentralized, and functions in a peer-to-peer ecosystem, its price is theoretically resistant to the crypto market volatility.

The total capitalization of the crypto market, according to CoinMarketCap, decreased by 2.8%, to $1.87 trillion. Bitcoin's (BTC) dominance ratio – its share of the overall crypto market capitalization – slipped by 0.3 percentage point to 40.7%.  XRP’s rise came amid positive sentiment for the payments tokens as Ripple founder Brad Garlinghouse said Thursday its ongoing defense against a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was going “much better than expected.”  Ripple, which uses XRP in its payments protocol, disputes the SEC's contention that the XRP token was issued and sold as an unregistered security to U.S. investors.  XRP broke over resistance at $0.75 to as much as $0.80 in Asian hours on Friday before slightly retreating. If the current buying power continues, the tokens could regain the $0.82 and above levels.  Positive proceedings have historically caused a surge in XRP prices as investors see the ending of a legal case as an overall bullish sign. In February, for instance, XRP climbed 22% as important documents related to the case were ruled to be unsealed.  Meanwhile, DOGE’s rise came as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk offered to take over the entirety of the popular social media platform Twitter (TWTR). Musk holds a 9.2% stake and has offered to take Twitter private at a valuation of $54.20 per share.  DOGE rose to resistance of 15 cents on Friday morning from Thursday’s $0.13 levels, price charts show. Current price action could see DOGE continue a broader uptrend since March, when prices rose from the $0.11 mark.  Musk’s potential involvement in Twitter isn’t directly related to dogecoin. But some analysts speculate that Musk, who has publicly backed dogecoin's growth and development, could integrate the token in some capacity on Twitter.  “The speculation is that advertisers could be able to pay DOGE for ads and for other uses on Twitter,” explained Kryptomon Chief Marketing Officer Tomer Nuni in a note to CoinDesk last week. “We have seen the same happening when Tesla revealed the ability to pay for its goods with DOGE. So the speculation could be around Musk’s businesses and stakeholdings starting to accept crypto, as Tesla does.”  The speculations aren’t all hot air either: Musk teased DOGE payments on in a tweet earlier this week when asked about lowering the cost for Twitter’s premium subscriptions.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | XRP,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/15/xrp-dogecoin-outperform-as-crypto-markets-continue-slide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a436d25f0b3cdc9a38ba147cb68c8b87fd67ad57-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423522,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aWTh,1650024197,Bitcoin Regains $40K as Sentiment Turns to 'Extreme Fear',"Crypto markets continued a second day of slide on Friday as bitcoin hovered above pivotal support at $40,000 in European hours, data shows.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, bounced to $40,100 early Friday, after losing 2.9% Thursday.  Bitcoin is trading near the $40,000 support level, which runs through the lows of the first three months of the year. Current price action is, however, a sign of alarm among some traders.  “A formal signal to break the support will be considered a failure under the previous lows in the $38,000 area,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “The ability to develop a reversal to the offensive from these levels, on the contrary, will reinforce the importance of this moderate uptrend line.”  The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a popular sentiment indicator that's hosted on the website Alternative.me, suggested “extreme fear” among crypto investors on Friday, with a reading at 22. That's down from last week’s “fear” reading of 37.  The index generates a single number, between 1 and 100, with 1 indicating that the crypto market is in a state of extreme fear (meaning people are selling,) while on the other end of the spectrum, 100 indicates that the market is undergoing an extreme level of greed (meaning people are buying).  Analysts said bitcoin could see more choppy price action in the coming months.  ""Bitcoin sold off hard during Q4, but then during the first frame of 2022 it underwent a period of relatively directionless trading,” explained Paul Robinson, strategist at DailyFX, told CoinDesk in an email.  “Contracting price action over the last three months could continue to make things even choppier in the near term, but given the nature of volatility (expanding/contracting) and the fact that this is bitcoin, volatility is likely to ramp up again as we head towards the middle of the year,” Robinson added.  Those predictions are despite April being a historically bullish month for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/15/bitcoin-regains-40k-as-sentiment-turns-to-extreme-fear,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d1a6061c2656056ece0557c345b8c908ca75ff9-1500x1094.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The software code that bitcoin uses, called &apos;proof of work&apos;, performs complex mathematical calculations to confirm a transaction on the network is the reason why it takes up so much energy. Data shows that Bitcoin mining burns up 91 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, which is more energy than a small country like Finland uses in an entire year. This is about the annual domestic electricity consumption of the entire nation of Sweden. According to Digiconomist, a single bitcoin transaction uses the same amount of power that the average American household consumes in a month, and is responsible for roughly a million times more carbon emissions than a single Visa transaction.

Musk already purchased a majority 9.2 percent stake in the company earlier this month and was set to become a member of its board, before he reversed the decision. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO believes that the social media firm has potential but it needs to go private for it to thrive. In a letter addressed to Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor, Musk wrote, &apos;I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.&apos; Michael Saylor Has An Advice For Musk Regarding Twitter Commenting on Musk&apos;s move, Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, advised Musk to buy a fraction of BTC in case his offer to buy all of Twitter is rejected by the company&apos;s board.

Court Made Its Decision on Hinman&apos;s Crypto Speech On April 11, Judge Sarah Netburn denied SEC&apos;s request to reconsider its order compelling the agency to produce documents and communications related to a speech by previous SEC director William Hinman. Previously, the SEC argued that Hinman&apos;s speech was his own personal views on crypto rather than the agency&apos;s policy. Then, in an attempt to protect SEC notes from reaching the courtroom, the regulatory agency argued that the speech was actually reflective of the agency&apos;s policy, and, therefore, any emails or communications related to it could be protected under the deliberative process privilege (DPP). In the U.S., the DPP allows certain areas of the government to claim immunity to discovery or disclosure if the communications are about internal processes. With such contradicting views, Judge Netburn argued that the agency cannot have it &apos;both ways&apos; in an attempt to overthrow Ripple. &apos;First, the Court disagrees with the SEC that the text of the Speech shows Hinman&apos;s intent to provide a &apos;framewo...",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/hinmans-speech-not-reflective-of-sec-court-declares-on-sec-vs-ripple-case/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hinmans-speech-not-reflective-of-sec-court-declares-on-sec-vs-ripple-case,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

The price action was, however, dampened too soon as the coin after registering a hike of 7%, dipped by 4% at the time of writing. The 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin also took a hit at the time of writing. Bitcoin&apos;s fear index read 28 which corresponds with the fear sentiment, this reflected fear surrounding another crash for the king coin. It turns out that there hasn&apos;t been much impact on the prices even after the LFG Bitcoin purchase. LFG at the beginning of this week had added 2508 BTC which is worth over $100 Million to its UST reserve. This has taken the BTC count to $42,406.92. Additionally, the U.S inflation rate spiked by 8.5%, a rate that hasn&apos;t been recorded in over 4 decades.

42394228,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaTe9,1649981930,"Yes, Crypto Is Cool. But How About Starting With More User-Friendly Tools?","Many people believe that crypto will increase access to financial services for underbanked communities.  These crypto proponents say that the abundance of mobile devices will allow people to skip banks altogether and to use crypto instead. More than five billion people in the world – nearly 70% – currently own a cell phone, according to the international mobile technology trade organization GSMA, and a large portion come from underserved areas with little if any access to banking services.  The crypto believers say that crypto, particularly some of the latest Web 3 innovations, offers hope for the underbanked, and that serving the underbanked is where crypto can be most useful. They add that traditional financial institutions’ slothlike service can’t compete with cryptocurrency technology.  But new crypto technologies are far from helping underserved communities escape their financial isolation. The companies behind crypto, including but not limited to decentralized finance (DeFi), have failed to provide user friendly apps, educational resources and other tools.  The tools themselves are often hard to use. As a result, bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptos have yet to make substantial inroads as usable currencies. Bitcoin’s volatility is also discouraging. How can people put faith in an asset whose price seems to rise and fall with the winds?  Indeed, even as public awareness about crypto mushrooms, and some of the world’s largest institutional investors launch their first projects to address demand for the asset, crypto has yet to approach parity with traditional currencies. Even in the United States, with its massive wealth and hubs of innovation, people rarely use crypto to pay rent, taxes or other common expenses. Relatively few retailers accept it.  What can crypto provide if the controls are hard to use and those who might use it don’t have enough willing partners to make the system work? They might as well be given fighter jets to fly.  To be sure, I remain a believer in crypto’s potential. I see bitcoin, and perhaps several altcoins one day becoming common forms of exchange. I view blockchain technology as a way to improve entrenched, centralized systems in financial services and perhaps every other industry. I believe that crypto can change lives because it serves the individual consumer’s needs.  Read More:A Digital Dollar May Help the Poor, but It’s Far From a Done Deal  But I would like to suggest an alternative approach to crypto, an intermediary step while we wait for the right conditions for widespread adoption to occur that makes more sense than trying to convert people unready for conversion.  Financial services organizations and policy makers would do better focusing on widening access to the services that the underbanked need to conduct transactions, even if those are not related to crypto. Underserved communities need help now, and whether this assistance is rooted in fiat currency and central banking systems should not hamstring the process.  A volatile asset  Crypto is more of an investment class than a payment method or new banking system. And while its trajectory has risen markedly in its short history, even with some massive dips, such as the current six-month decline from a high of nearly $70,000 in the fall of 2021, there is no guarantee of it holding its value from one day to the next. Such changeability is frightening for people dealing with survival issues, and perhaps accustomed to their own native currencies losing value quickly.  Such fear is particularly relevant now. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inflation was soaring. Think the U.S.’s 8.5% inflation is high, look at other countries.  Brazil, which was once a model of economic improvement, now struggles with over 10% inflation. Nigeria, a business hub for sub-Saharan Africa, has been fighting nearly 16% levels, which represents an improvement from much of 2021 (see below). And a number of developing countries are higher, still.  Stablecoins?  Some crypto observers believe that stablecoins may offer a better alternative to bitcoin because they are less volatile and seem more familiar by virtue of their ties to the U.S. dollar. The crypto startup Reserve is even trying to get people in South Africa and in other countries to use its stablecoin.  Read More:Can Bitcoin Deliver on its Promise to the World's Unbanked?  But stablecoins suffer from many of the same problems as BTC and other cryptos. They are difficult to fathom and to use. Not many people accept them.  The next time you visit a coffee shop, ask the barista if they accept USDC or terra. They’ll think you’re from outer space and point to their Square console.  The need for a better on-ramp  I don’t mean to sound discouraging. Crypto will one day be an option widely available for daily transactions. Its logic and efficiency are too compelling to ignore. But we have not yet arrived at that point. We are at a transitional stage in the global economy with communities that once seemed like unpromising bystanders starting to participate. But they need help now.  Instead of focusing on blockchain technologies that remain outside their grasp, albeit tantalizingly, they would be better served by on-ramps to centralized financial networks, particularly the U.S. monetary system that, at least for now, plays the pivotal role in financial markets. This is not to excuse these systems’ flaws.  We would not have blockchain technology and bitcoin if they were perfect. The Canadian trucker protests underscored centralized systems’ vulnerability to state oversight.  Inspired by the protests, David Heinemeier Hansson, the founder of programming language Ruby on Rails and a hardcore technologist, recently wrote that he could see a future for cryptocurrencies in countries during periods of unrest. He noted that crypto could help individuals circumvent state surveillance that has risen over the past two years amid the global COVID-19 pandemic and other chaotic events globally.  And we have seen crypto’s power in the ability of Ukraine supporters raising $100 million to fight off Russia’s unprovoked invasion. No traditional monetary system could have raised such an amount with the speed and efficiency of blockchain.  But people for now want a way to conduct their business. Even in underbanked areas, the most reasonable options still require a traditional financial services provider.  That will one day change as crypto continues to embed itself more firmly in our daily lives. But simpler technological innovations offer greater, immediate help for underserved populations.  Access to simple things like a bank account via a phone would be a more impactful first step than skipping over the basics and going right into crypto. That doesn’t sound like much, but for now it will have to suffice. Crypto’s time will come soon enough.
