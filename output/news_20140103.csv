42376778,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRH9,1388774679,Statistics Chief at China's Central Bank Bearish on Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, like other virtual currencies, is fundamentally not a currency, the head of the Chinese central bank's financial survey and statistics department, Sheng Song Cheng, wrote in an opinion piece published online on 2nd January.  Sheng's piece added that it would be difficult to see how bitcoin could ever be considered a currency in the future.  Although Sheng's view underlines the central bank's official position laid out last month, which states that bitcoin is not a currency ""with real meaning"", the statistics head took the additional step of labelling the cryptocurrency a ""utopia"" for those with beliefs in technology and liberalism verging on the extreme.  The English-language edition of the Global Times, a newspaper published by the conservative People's Daily, reported Sheng's phrasing in a news piece as:  ""Bitcoin is merely a utopia for technology supremacists and absolute liberalists.""  Sheng's department is responsible for developing the statistics system for China's financial sector and designing the accounting system related to monetary statistics, among other duties.  Commenters appeared to disagree with Sheng's views. The top comment on Sheng's piece, which was published in the opinion pages of leading news portal Sina, sarcastically asked:  ""States can wither away too, my friend. Can you please show more vision?""  China's central bank banned financial institutions from dealing in bitcoin after declaring on 5th December that the digital currency didn't have the legal status of a ""currency with real meaning"". However, individuals remain free to deal in bitcoin.  The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has been closely watched for signals of its attitude towards regulating bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The PBOC's statement in December sent bitcoin's price into a nosedive, shedding $300 in a single morning on Mt. Gox. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index lost $555 over two days.  On 16th December, news leaked that the PBOC had taken the additional step of barring third-party payment companies from working with bitcoin exchanges. Bitcoin's value fell by 22% at its lowest point within 24 hours of the announcement, according to the BPI.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/03/statistics-chief-at-chinas-central-bank-bearish-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3642eee2e49facf118c1adc6718bd3294064a7fa-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376799,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRdn,1388770618,London Clinic Performs Hair Transplants For Bitcoin,"A London clinic has completed a hair transplant paid for in bitcoin. Vinci Hair Clinic, located in London's medical treatments hub Harley Street, said it completed the hair transplant on 18th Dec for the price of 11.538461 BTC.  The clinic said its hair transplant patient was a 32-year-old man from the Middle East who wanted to remain anonymous. The patient paid the clinic in bitcoin, which was worth $6,000 at the time, which the clinic immediately converted to GBP.  ""We started to take bitcoin seriously in November when we got inundated with requests to pay in bitcoins,"" said Vinci managing director Salvar Bjornsson in a press release.  International payment problems  Vinci's customers were clamouring to pay in bitcoin in November, when the price of the digital currency spiked relative to fiat currencies. But customer demand wasn't the only reason for the hair clinic to adopt the digital currency. According to Ken Fryer, a spokesman for the clinic, accepting bitcoin payments from customers solved some major headaches surrounding international transactions:  ""We have had customers who faced problems with fund transfers due to currency and banking restrictions. We have had to cancel surgeries because clients were not able to transfer funds to the UK in time.""  Vinci operates clinics in London, Spain, Dubai and Brazil. About a third of customers at its London clinic travel for treatment from outside the UK. In Spain and Dubai, the figure is larger, with about half the customers at those clinics travelling across borders for procedures. All Vinci clinics now accept bitcoin as a form of payment.  ""We are hoping that bitcoin can help us solve this problem at our clinics worldwide,"" Fryer said.  The hair restoration business  Vinci is part of a global industry for hair restoration procedures worth $1.9bn last year, according to Fryer. The clinic's most popular procedure is the hair transplant, where hair is surgically moved from the back of a patient's head, where it's abundant, to the front, where it's thinning. The procedure costs anything from £4,000 to £12,000, depending on the size of the area that's being transplanted.  According to Fryer, the trickiest part of getting a hair transplant right isn't the surgery itself. Instead, it's making sure patients have a clear idea of the procedure's outcome:  ""Getting the patient to have a realistic expectation of the whole procedure is equally important.""  A less costly procedure that's growing in popularity is scalp pigmentation, Fryer said. The goal of scalp pigmentation is to help a patient achieve the look of an extremely closely shaved hairstyle. Vinci uses technicians, who are supervised by doctors, to tattoo the patient's scalp to create the effect of closely cropped hair. Scalp pigmentation costs £2,500 on average at Vinci.  Vinci was established in 2006 with clinics in London and Malaga in Spain. The privately held firm currently employs eight doctors and 120 people in total, according to Fryer.  However, a cursory Google search by CoinDesk revealed several negative reviews for Vinci's treatments on hair loss forums. When asked about the reviews, Bjornsson claimed they were written by ""one person"" and said the clinic is taking legal action to have the reviews removed. Bjornsson wrote in an email, referring to the reviews:  ""Anyone with half a brain will se (sic) through this.""  Medical tourism  Customers jetting around the world for medical procedures – cosmetic or otherwise – drive the global medical tourism industry. In the UK, medical tourism has been estimated to be worth £42m to hospitals in 2010 and £219m to the wider economy, including hotels, restaurants, shopping and transport, according to a study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and York University.  Clinics focused on medical tourism are keen to adopt bitcoin because it is easily transferred. For example, CoinDesk reported on Nordorthopaedics, a Lithuanian clinic focused on international patients, that started accepting bitcoin payments in December because funds could be transferred quickly and with minimal fees.  For clinics with significant amounts of international customers, like Vinci and Nordorthopaedics, bitcoin payments make sense. As Vinci's Bjornsson noted:  ""We currently receive payments in over 10 different currencies so adding another [one] is no problem.""

42376786,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eROh,1388766018,Robocoin Bitcoin ATMs Head to Taiwan and Hong Kong,"The first batch of Robocoin ATMs destined for the Far East is expected to land in Taiwan and Hong Kong later this month.  The company is planning to expand its presence in Europe and North America, but for now, eight new units are receiving final touches and they should ship to Asia sometime in January. The company noted that it is heading to “bitcoin-hungry” markets in Asia, namely Taiwan and Hong Kong. It is not clear whether mainland China will get any bitcoin ATMs soon, given its clampdown on bitcoin operators last month.  “Bitcoin demand in Asia is amazing,” said Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley. “We have many Asian countries seeking to enhance consumer capability to buy and sell bitcoin securely and safely.”  The ATMs destined for the Asian market will feature a new user interface in simplified and traditional Chinese, but other than that they appear to be standard Robocoin units.  Kelley also highlighted Robocoin’s commitment to complying with local regulation and delivering consumer protection software. The ATMs combine biometric authentication, government issued ID scanning as well as verified facial matching, which makes them somewhat more secure than traditional ATMs we use every day.  Robocoin says it has sold dozens of units so far and global distribution is slated for January. Things should pick up in March, when the company plans to ship 39 units worldwide. Other international locations include Europe, Canada, the US and other Asian countries, although the company has not disclosed the exact locations. However, in a recent interview with Tech Crunch, Robocoin’s Sam Glaser hinted at Manhattan as one of the next locations.  Of course, Robocoin is not the only company vying for the lead in the bitcoin ATM market. Last week Lamassu announced the sale of its 100th bitcoin ATM and it claims to have received more than 120 orders since it started accepting pre-orders in August. More than a dozen Lamassu ATMs have been delivered so far.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/03/robocoin-bitcoin-atms-head-to-taiwan-and-hong-kong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89b35f352b06d5f9c5e4ebe891f2d11314a32699-1024x703.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376790,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRTj,1388757066,Indian Tax Authorities Seek Clarification on Bitcoin,"Just a few days after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a digital currency warning, Indian authorities started cracking down on local bitcoin exchanges.  Within two days the first raids were carried out, although the owners of the platforms were not arrested and, at present, it does not appear that they have been charged with any crime.  The raids were carried out by India’s Enforcement Directorate, but now it seems that their colleagues at the Income Tax Department are just as keen to flex their muscle on digital currency outfits.  The Hindu reports  that taxmen paid a visit to Tumkur-based Coin Monk Ventures, a bitcoin mining startup aiming to bring bitcoin awareness to the public. Coin Monk founder Satvik V said:  “They took interviews of my employees and were happy that Coin Monk was a properly registered company. Much of the discussion that took place was over how bitcoin actually works and how income tax can be levied on miners and exchanges.”  Good morning sir, we would like a free bitcoin lecture  Oddly enough, Satvik’s description of the visit leads us to conclude that it was a courtesy call. He said the taxmen were interested in how bitcoin works and they were wondering whether it would be possible to create a database of digital currency users in India.  It did not end there. Satvik was summoned to meet Income Tax Department officials in Bangalore:  “They have asked me to submit a technical paper on how bitcoin works, and, more importantly, what role a government-authorized exchange could play.”  It is not every day that the executive branch asks people that it is supposed to be regulating to explain what they are supposed to be regulating in the first place, or for that matter to submit their own suggestions.  What government-authorized exchange?  The whole affair may have gone under the radar had it not been for the last part of Satvik’s statement. The RBI has made it clear that it does not wish to deal with digital currencies and that it does not know what to do about it.  Indian exchanges cannot get regulatory approval and the RBI is apparently happy to keep it that way, effectively rendering bitcoin exchanges illegal in the world’s second most populous country.  However, if the Income Tax Department is going around and asking bitcoiners to come up with their ideas and talking about government authorized exchanges, it might not be as bad as it seems.  While it is easy to view all branches of government and central banks as a monolithic structure, their goals do not always match or overlap.  Central bankers don’t want bitcoin around for a number of reasons, while taxmen take a more pragmatic approach. When they see something that can be taxed, they tend to do what they do best - tax it. However, to do that they need a legal framework.

42376798,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRcX,1388752202,Alpha Technology Takes Pre-Orders for Litecoin ASIC Miners,"Alpha Technology, the British company who announced in November it would be one of the first to bring ASIC mining devices for litecoin and similar cryptocurrencies to market in 2014, this week announced it would begin taking pre-orders for 30% deposits.  Customers may now register their interest on the website. There will be two devices available, both employing stacked Viper Boards: one 5MH/s device for £1,350 (about $2,225) and a 25MH/s device for £5,450 (about $8,980), plus VAT for UK customers.  Alpha Technology  said both the hashing rates and delivery times quoted were deliberately conservative estimates, and actual shipping should be well underway by Q2-Q3 of 2014. The prices quoted on the product page are the deposit amounts.  The machines are standalone, with no need for a host PC. They feature a LCD panel on the enclosure and can be configured with WebGUI via a desktop or mobile device, bringing access to alt-coin mining to less experienced users.  Different needs  While all serious bitcoin mining these days is performed with specially-designed ASIC and FPGA-based chipsets, such technology has eluded other currencies using the scrypt algorithm so far.  This is mainly due to the choice of scrypt to deliberately resist these chips due to its intensive use of more expensive memory, keeping mining in the hands of enthusiasts with consumer grade GPU mining hardware for longer.  If Alpha Technology and others can deliver their new designs, that could be about to change, though the hashing power required to mine litecoin remains substantially lower than bitcoin.  Its devices could also be used to mine any other cryptocurrencies using the same scrypt algorithm that were gaining popularity, such as Novacoin, Feathercoin, and even Dogecoin.  To produce the devices the company has partnered with Indian engineering firm Dexcel Designs, who have been involved with large scale embedded product engineering for 13 years and worked with international companies like Intel, Texas Instruments, Altera, Xilinx, and Analog Devices.  Dexcel Designs were handling all development and quality assurance, while Alpha Technology supplied its expertise in cryptocurrencies and mining specific issues.  Trusting hardware companies  Alpha Technology's CEO Mohammed Akram said reputation was important, and has stressed a need for transparency and reliability throughout the development process.  Some companies in the bitcoin mining realm struggled with credibility issues in 2013 bringing cutting-edge equipment to market on time and on price.  This is the reason Alpha Technology will be accepting only 30% deposits on orders, with the remaining 70% required two months before shipping. Akram said deposits are refundable (with penalties and conditions depending on timing) if orders are canceled.  Akram explained:  ""The 30% deposit is something no ASIC company has done before. This is due to the confidence we have in our development and planning ahead, engineering work from Dexcel Designs has been great and we will be working with Global Foundries for our chip fabrication.""  It would supply ""Kickstarter style"" regular updates with videos of its progress as a way of keeping in close contact with those who ordered.  Akram continued:  ""The live updates we are proposing should give in depths into what we are doing on a daily basis with videos, images and specifications. Customers are paying and while they wait they deserve to know what is going on, we will be giving as much transparency as possible.""  On its website, the company called the listed hashing estimates of 5MH/s and 25 MH/s a ""worst-case scenario"" with the final shipping devices expected to beat those estimates.  Akram said the majority of the litecoin network's hashing power would remain GPU-based for much of 2014, and would not see any significant rises during that time.  After that, ASICs would offer advantages not only in hashing power but would be more energy (and thus cost) efficient than GPU rigs.  Though still worth substantially less, litecoin is the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency and its price has shadowed that of bitcoin as it rose, fell, and rose over the past couple of months.  After hitting a lowly 0.0075 BTC as recently as 18th November, it rocketed up to 0.051 BTC within 10 days.  1 LTC is currently trading for 0.0309 BTC on the BTC-e exchange, or $25. Its current total market cap is just over $600m.

42376796,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRYl,1388749775,Leading Adult Site Porn.com Now Accepts Bitcoin,"Leading adult site Porn.com has started accepting bitcoin payments.  The site is one of the biggest adult entertainment operations on the Internet, if you don’t count illegal torrent sites. Porn.com currently accepts traditional credit card payments, PayPal and online cheques, along with bitcoin of course.  Bitcoin payments on adult sites are nothing uncommon, but Porn.com is by far the biggest service to embrace bitcoin. Most adult sites that accept bitcoin are tiny and easily dwarfed by Porn.com, as it is effectively an umbrella for heaps of smaller porn sites. The advantages of using bitcoin to pay for adult content are more or less obvious. People are not too keen to share their credit card data with small adult websites and they have perfectly good reasons aside from anonymity.  Although the word 'reputable' does not really apply to most adult sites, it is worth note that adult content is huge on the Internet. According to recent studies, adult content accounts for as much as 30% of total internet bandwidth. Adult websites attract more than 450 million unique visitors each month. Unsurprisingly men lead the way, but an estimated 30% of women also enjoy Internet porn.  Porn.com tapped BitPay to process bitcoin payments, which is not surprising given BitPay’s recent streak of successes. However, BitPay’s terms of service were a problem, as they specifically excluded certain businesses involved in the adult entertainment industry.  Tech veterans also like to point out that adult content has a weird way of affecting industry trends. They often cite video format wars as a prime example. BetaMax and HD-DVD were doomed after the adult industry chose to focus on VHS and Blu-Ray instead.  We are bound to hear similar arguments with respect to bitcoin, although they do not apply to the payments industry for a number of reasons. Still, when it comes to the adult industry it is hard to ignore some basic advantages offered by digital currencies compared to traditional payment methods, namely anonymity.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/03/leading-adult-site-porncom-now-accepts-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c357b14da8ba95657deee77a2c0efd84907a228-1051x777.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As if Dogecoin was not enough, the flamboyant artist is about to get a digital currency named after him. Coinye West is the name of the new coin and it should go live in eight days.  Though we can't fault the design and Coinye is certainly getting plenty of coverage, we are not sure Kanye or his lawyers will be flattered (if South Park is to be believed Kanye hasn't always taken jokes well). Especially as it doesn't appear that the Coinye West team got permission to use his image. (In an interview with Noisey, the developers said they ""want to stay sorta anonymous in case kanye gets pissed off."")  The Coinye West team reached out to Kanye on Twitter, but so far they have not received a reply.    @kanyewest Kanye, have you ever invested in bitcoin or litecoin?

The developers are still working on mining software dubbed ‘CoinyeMiner’, although we would have gone with ‘Gold Digger’. The currency is Scrypt-based and the developers say their goal is to make mining a one-click proposition, allowing every user to mine their coins.  The developers told Noisey they could imagine a future ""where Coinye is used to buy concert tickets"" and said they'd give Kanye West 100,000 Coinye at the launch if he got in touch with them. They have also reportedly said that some online merchants have been in touch to find out how they can accept Coinye payments.
