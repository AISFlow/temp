42397433,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PPt,1395786768,Decentralized Applications to Offer More Than Just Bitcoin Transactions,"The future of digital currencies and the question of whether that future involves decentralized applications took centre stage at CoinSummit San Francisco on 25th March in a talk that included Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin; Mastercoin Foundation's David Johnston; and NXT's Brian Snyder.  The panel was moderated by Adam Levine of popular online podcast Let’s talk Bitcoin.    ________________________________________________________________    The purpose of distributed applications is to better economize digital resources.  The concept of bitcoin was the impetus for this, but Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum, David Johnson of Mastercoin and Brian Snyder of NXT believe that there are many use cases for cryptographic systems outside of just money systems, the use case that bitcoin has popularized.  Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin told the CoinSummit crowd that cloud storage is one example of decentralization disrupting software:  ""Dropbox has a markup of 100x. But, what if you could reduce that to 10x? What if you could sell space on your hard drive?""  Such forward-thinking ideas were on full display in a talk that discussed how bitcoin could have ramifications beyond the world of finance, and how today's entrepreneurs are working toward this goal.  Next-generation projects  The panelists talked at great length about distributed uses beyond bitcoin, and how soon these ideas will come to life.  Mastercoin's David Johnston, whose organisation provides a protocol that uses bitcoin to enable embeddable records such as smart contracts, said:  ""In 5-6 years I think you'll see a billion people using bitcoin, but they won't even see that they are using.""  The proof-of-stake cyrptocurrency NXT is focused on fraud prevention via the use of tokens, Brian Snyder told the audience. The idea is to build something distributed but also provable and secure.  ""I've seen credit cards get hacked, I've seen IDs hacked,"" Snyder said.  Ethereum is building distributed autonomous corporations, or DACs, to offer more complex functions to enforce the advanced functions of money.  Said Buterin, the core developer of Ethereum:  ""We want to reinvent the wheel. And make it better.""  He said that Ethereum is focused on building a more scalable bitcoin that can do much more than just spend.  Added Buterin: ""I think the reason to do this independently [of bitcoin] is all about scalability.""  Distributed software interest  The panelists agreed that Bitcoin's rising price and hashing power are major problems, ones that they say squeezs out the mainstream's interest in building out its infrastructure.  Said Buterin:  ""Bitcoin itself isn't really all that egalitarian.""  Alternatives such as NXT, Mastercoin and Ethereum are next-generation software concepts that can inject new ideas into the cryptocurrency community. Mining is important for today's cryptocurrencies, but new ways to offer incentives to the community are going to be important.  Said David Johnston:  ""If you're not doing something that requires hashing power, you need to find ways to incentivize other groups.""  The talk concluded with what David Johnston called 'Johnston's Law':  ""Everything that can be decentralized, will be decentralized,"" he said.

42397445,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9Pai,1395786527,Denmark Declares Bitcoin Trades are Tax-Free,"It seems like the United States is not the only country making important decisions about bitcoin in the middle of its tax season.  Shortly after the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) declared that it would treat digital currencies as property for tax purposes, the Tax Board in Denmark has ruled that gains and losses from casual bitcoin trading are not subject to taxation.  Politiken  reports that Denmark's top tax authority met today to discuss digital currencies and how to approach their taxation, and the Tax Board concluded that any gains made from bitcoin trading are exempt from being taxed by the Danish government, and similarly any losses from trading are not deductible.  A long-awaited decision  The Danish government has been under pressure to decide the fate of digital currency taxation for months, according to Michael Popp-Madsen, a member of Denmark's bitcoin community.  The increasing popularity of bitcoin and other digital currencies combined with uncertainty about their tax status in Denmark has brought a lot of attention on the Tax Board to decide one way or another whether bitcoin will be taxed.  Said Popp-Madsen:  ""They have postponed this decision since December and were originally supposed to come to a conclusion in January. Today is the first time they have made a decision, and I think that's a sign that the Tax Board was unsure how to approach bitcoin.""  Popp-Madsen says that he ultimately thinks the Tax Board made the best decision, and that it may have had a hard time trying to tax digital currencies anyway, given their cryptographic nature.  Bitcoin transactions considered ""purely private""  Part of the reasoning behind the Tax Board's decision to keep bitcoin gains and losses exempt from taxation is that since digital currencies don't exist in a physical form, they can't be considered ""real"" money to be taxed by the government.  Hanne Søgaard Hansen, the chairman of the Tax Board, explained the organisation's decision:  ""We see the outcome of bitcoin transactions as a result of something purely private. Therefore, any gains on bitcoin are tax-exempt, and losses are not deductible.""  The exception to this new ruling is for businesses whose primary focus is in digital currencies. Businesses who directly trade with bitcoin as their primary function must declare their winnings and losses to the government.  Community reaction  Denmark's decision to make bitcoin winnings tax exempt (and losses non-deductible) strikes a contrast against the US's decision to classify bitcoin as property for tax purposes.  Members of the bitcoin community quickly voiced their opinions on reddit, comparing the decisions made today by the US and Danish governments:  As more countries around the world start to take notice of digital currencies, different regulatory approaches are being seen.  While governments may disagree about how much regulation is necessary, one government official in Japan recently called for an international effort in approaching bitcoin regulation.

42397442,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9Pbh,1395782618,CoinSummit Venture Capitalists Seek 'Killer' Bitcoin App,"Some of Silicon Valley's most innovative investors gathered at CoinSummit San Francisco to discuss where the smart money will go next in the digital currency space, including Meyer “Micky” Malka, founder of Ribbit Capital; Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners; Hemant Taneja, a partner at General Catalyst Partners; and Jean-Francois ""Jeff"" Clavier, founder and managing partner of SoftTech VC.  The venture capitalists assembled for CoinSummit's Tuesday, 25th March, panel on investment opportunities in the bitcoin space are ready to invest more money in bitcoin ventures. The catch is, they're looking for ""killer apps"" that solve real problems.  This sentiment was best laid forth by Ribbit Capital's Micky Malka, who said:  ""We're looking for people who are building useful cases around the [Bitcoin] protocol. There are good companies out there trying to get people into bitcoin, but there aren't useful cases. We haven't seen the killer useful app come out.""  There are plenty of financial pain points in the world just waiting for bitcoin startups to solve them, the panelists said.  Overseas opportunities  Malka, who was born in Venezuela, noted that currency exchange in his home country is difficult because there are about five different exchange rates, running from the black-market bargain basement to the official rate.  In China, Lightspeed Venture Partner's Jeremy Liew said 65% of e-commerce transactions are paid for in cash.  Said Liew:  ""A guy puts your package on a bicycle, he rides to your house and delivers your package, and then you decide whether or not you're going to pay him. The return rates and logistics costs for that are much higher in that sort of environment.""  Access to a low-cost, bitcoin-enabled digital payment method could change all that and lower costs for e-commerce businesses in China and other developing countries substantially, he said.  It's no coincidence that both examples highlight overseas opportunities. Americans enjoy reasonably affordable and easy to access banking services, and most Americans have adequate faith in the value of the US dollar, Liew said.  Added Liew:  ""When you leave the shores of the United States, you don't have to go very far to find places where neither of those things are true. Just in the same way the developing world has leapfrogged to wireless, I think there's an opportunity for the developing world to leap over credit cards and go directly to digital currency.""  Emphasis on infrastructure  Echoing Marc Andreessen's statements in one of the day's earlier sessions, Taneja, of General Catalyst Partners, said he wants to invest in infrastructure companies that will make some of these consumer applications practical.  Like Andreessen, Taneja would like to see a bitcoin equivalent to Red Hat. Also on the investor's wish list is a Verisign-like company that would handle verification. Said Taneja:  ""These kinds of fundamental infrastructure components need to exist before some of these apps can truly thrive.""  Taneja acknowledged that this kind of infrastructure build-out does not happen overnight.  ""We have a long view on this,"" he said, explaining that he is looking for return on investment in the 10-year range.  Part of laying the groundwork is bringing the establishment on board, Malka said.  ""We need more banks participating in this. We need regulators. I'm part of the Bitcoin Foundation – we are out there trying to educate regulators.""  Getting regulators on board will help get the banks to come along, Liew predicted.  ""If the regulators explicitly set forth rules that say, 'Bright line, do this, you will find a bank that is willing to take on bitcoin customers,'"" Liew said.

42397437,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PTp,1395780836,Bitcoin Exchange Kraken Raises $5 Million in Latest Funding Round,"Payward, Inc., the owner of US-based digital currency exchange Kraken, announced on 25th March that it has raised $5m in new capital as part of a Series A fundraising round.  Kraken  , first launched in September 2013, allows users to buy and sell bitcoin, namecoin, dogecoin and Ripple, among other digital currencies.  The round was led by Hummingbird Ventures, an early-phase venture capital firm that has invested in digital properties like Dubai-based price comparison platform Souqalmal.com and object-based software defined storage service provider Amplidata in recent months.  The funding will be used by Payward to strengthen Kraken's position in the global digital currency market.  Conservative approach  Jesse Powell, CEO at Kraken, told CoinDesk that the company plans to deploy its new funding to meet key development and regulatory needs.  ""We're taking a very conservative approach to [regulation and compliance], and this funding allows us to continue to be conservative and to be compliant to the law, and we think this is just the best approach in the long term.""  The news comes as the US government issued new guidance on digital currencies. The Internal Revenue Service announced on 25th March that it would treat them like property, making them subject to capital gains tax treatment.  Given the increased burden of compliance requirements, Kraken is taking its approach to these matters seriously.  ""We're really excited, we've been putting the round together for a long time, the funding is going to go to development, regulatory stuff, getting all the licenses in the United States and around the world. A lot of it is going to go into legal.""  Pressure on exchanges  Earlier this week, Kraken announced that it had passed a verifiable proof of reserves audit. The test was carried out in order to bolster confidence in the exchange's ability to meet customer balance demands.  During the interview, Powell went on to speculate that some exchanges may face greater scrutiny in the months ahead.  ""This has been more of an issue lately with exchanges like Gox going down. We may see an increasingly greater heat on these unlicensed money transmitters and these exchanges that are a little more shady.""  In the wake of the collapse of Mt. Gox, exchanges have faced financial difficulties.

42377045,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPxf,1395778866,Andreessen at CoinSummit: Bitcoin Today is the Internet in 1994,"Marc Andreessen helped start the Internet revolution when he co-wrote early web browser Mosaic and co-founded Netscape. Now he views bitcoin as the next technological revolution on the scale of the Internet. Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm Andreessen runs with longtime collaborator Ben Horowitz, has invested about $50m in Coinbase and other bitcoin companies, and Andreessen recently vowed to invest hundreds of millions more in the space.  Balaji S. Srinivasan is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and is a vocal bitcoin proponent. Srinivasan co-founded Counsyl, a genetic screening company.  Andreessen and Srinivasan kicked off CoinSummit San Francisco with a 'fireside chat', moderated by Forbes reporter Kashmir Hill.  Like the Internet in 1994, bitcoin today is seen by the mainstream as ""weird and scary,"" Marc Andreessen said in the opening session of CoinSummit San Francisco on Tuesday 25th March.  Like bitcoin, he said, the Internet ""arrived as a fringe technology. It arrived with fringe politics and it arrived with fringe characters. [...] I don't know how you get fringe technology without fringe characters and fringe politics.""  But, just as he saw it happen with the Internet, Andreessen now sees a crop of high-quality entrepreneurs stepping forward to prove bitcoin's usefulness to the mainstream. Somewhere along that journey, he predicts, these ""fringe characters"" will feel alienated and move on.  Investment plans  With that comparison in mind, Andreessen Horowitz is looking to invest in a whole ecosystem of digital currency technology.  Said Andreessen:  ""In 1994, as a venture capital firm, it would have been a good idea to take the Internet seriously and it would have been a good idea to invest in a cross section of [Internet] companies [...] the venture firms that did do that did extremely well.""  Andreessen Horowitz is looking to fund two specific kinds of companies, Srinivasan said.  One is a company that would do for the Bitcoin protocol what Red Hat did for Linux, he said, professionalizing work on the open-source code. The other is a sort of Underwriters Laboratories for bitcoin, to verify the security and quality of bitcoin implementations.  Once these infrastructure companies are established, the opportunities for bitcoin to enable technological applications is almost limitless, Andreessen said.  He offered an example of an app that would allow drivers in San Francisco to find available garage spots and buy them from their mobile devices, maybe even through a real-time auction. Another idea would be to stop spam by imposing tiny fees on each email address selected by the sender, an application of bitcoin's usefulness in micropayments.  Explained Andreessen:  ""Twenty years ago, we were talking about this idea, and we just had no way to work out the payments.""  Emerging from the shadows  After four years of obscurity and perceived ignobility, bitcoin is finally emerging as the game-changing technology it was all along, the pair said.  The technology community needed ""four years of bashing on it in different ways"" to prove that the code is reliable, in part because of the protocol's possibly pseudonymous origin, Srinivasan said.  Bitcoin has finally moved beyond its association with the Silk Road drug marketplace, an association that was ""overblown"" to begin with, Andreessen said.  ""The exact same thing happened in the early '90s with the Internet. It was just this horror show, for God's sake, you would not want your teenager to go on this crazy Internet thing. By '95, '96, everybody went, 'Oh, this is actually pretty cool'.""  Hill wrapped up the session by asking Andreessen and Srinivasan for a response to Berkshire-Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett's now famous dismissal of bitcoin as a ""mirage"".  ""The historical track record of old white men who don't understand technology crapping on new technology is 100%,"" Andreessen quipped.  He received an appreciative chuckle from the bitcoin-friendly crowd.  Replied Srinivasan:  ""Bitcoin has outperformed Berkshire-Hathaway by a lot in the last year.""

42377030,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPdX,1395772321,"IRS to Tax Digital Currencies as Property, Not Currency","The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a new notice meant to clarify the tax treatment of digital currencies on Tuesday, 25th March.  Most notably, the US tax body, which has long been silent on the issue, indicated that it plans to treat digital currencies as property, not currency.  According to the IRS, the classification means that:  Digital currency payments made to independent contractors and service providers must be reported via Form 1099.  Profits and losses from the sale of digital currencies are subject to capital gains when being used as capital assets.  Wages paid to employees in digital currencies are taxable and must be reported.  The guidance comes ahead of the looming 15th April deadline for individual tax filings for fiscal year 2013.  In total, the IRS released answers to 16 frequently asked questions, including how the fair market value of digital currency assets will be evaluated, whether miners are subject to business or self-employment taxes, and whether penalties would be imposed on taxpayers who did not abide by these rules prior to the release.  Said the IRS:    ""In some environments, virtual currency operates like 'real' currency – i.e., the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance – but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.      The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes. General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.""    For more information, read the release in full below.  _____  IRS Virtual Currency Guidance: Virtual Currency Is Treated as Property for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes; General Rules for Property Transactions Apply    IR-2014-36, March. 25, 2014    WASHINGTON – The Internal Revenue Service today issued a notice providing answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) on virtual currency, such as Bitcoin. These FAQs provide basic information on the U.S. federal tax implications of transactions in, or transactions that use, virtual currency.  In some environments, virtual currency operates like “real” currency -- i.e., the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance -- but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.  The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes. General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.  Among other things, this means that:  Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.  Payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply. Normally, payers must issue Form 1099.  The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.  And here is a full Q&A:  SECTION 4. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  Q-1: How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes?  A-1: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.  Q-2: Is virtual currency treated as currency for purposes of determining whether a transaction results in foreign currency gain or loss under U.S. federal tax laws?  A-2: No. Under currently applicable law, virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss for U.S. federal tax purposes.  Q-3: Must a taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services include in computing gross income the fair market value of the virtual currency?  A-3: Yes. A taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services must, in computing gross income, include the fair market value of the virtual currency, measured in U.S. dollars, as of the date that the virtual currency was received. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on miscellaneous income from exchanges involving property or services.  Q-4: What is the basis of virtual currency received as payment for goods or services in Q&A-3?  A-4: The basis of virtual currency that a taxpayer receives as payment for goods or servicesin Q&A-3 is the fair market value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date of receipt. See Publication 551, Basis of Assets, for more information on the computation of basis when property is received for goods or services.  Q-5: How is the fair market value of virtual currency determined?  A-5: For U.S. tax purposes, transactions using virtual currency must be reported in U.S. dollars. Therefore, taxpayers will be required to determine the fair market value of virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date of payment or receipt.  If a virtual currency is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, the fair market value of the virtual currency is determined by converting the virtual currency into U.S. dollars (or into another real currency which in turn can be converted into U.S. dollars) at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.  Q-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for other property?  A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable gain.  The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency. See Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, for information about the tax treatment of sales and exchanges, such as whether a loss is deductible.  Q-7: What type of gain or loss does a taxpayer realize on the sale or exchange of virtual currency?  A-7: The character of the gain or loss generally depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. A taxpayer generally realizes capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. For example, stocks, bonds, and other investment property are generally capital assets.  A taxpayer generally realizes ordinary gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is not a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. Inventory and other property held mainly for sale to customers in a trade or business are examples of property that is not a capital asset. See Publication 544 for more information about capital assets and the character of gain or loss.  Q-8: Does a taxpayer who “mines” virtual currency (for example, uses computer resources to validate Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin transaction ledger) realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency resulting from those activities?  A-8: Yes, when a taxpayer successfully “mines” virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on taxable income.  Q-9: Is an individual who “mines” virtual currency as a trade or business subject to self-employment tax on the income derived from those activities?  A-9: If a taxpayer’s “mining” of virtual currency constitutes a trade or business, and the “mining” activity is not undertaken by the taxpayer as an employee, the net earnings from self-employment (generally, gross income derived from carrying on a trade or business less allowable deductions) resulting from those activities constitute self-employment income and are subject to the self-employment tax. See Chapter 10 of Publication 334, Tax Guide for Small Business, for more information on self-employment tax and Publication 535, Business Expenses, for more information on determining whether expenses are from a business activity carried on to make a profit.  Q-10: Does virtual currency received by an independent contractor for performing services constitute self‑employment income?  A-10: Yes. Generally, self‑employment income includes all gross income derived by an individual from any trade or business carried on by the individual as other than an employee. Consequently, the fair market value of virtual currency received for services performed as an independent contractor, measured in U.S. dollars as of the date of receipt, constitutes self‑employment income and is subject to the self-employment tax. See FS-2007-18, April 2007, Business or Hobby? Answer Has Implications for Deductions, for information on determining whether an activity is a business or a hobby.  Q-11: Does virtual currency paid by an employer as remuneration for services constitute wages for employment tax purposes?  A-11: Yes. Generally, the medium in which remuneration for services is paid is immaterial to the determination of whether the remuneration constitutes wages for employment tax purposes. Consequently, the fair market value of virtual currency paid as wages is subject to federal income tax withholding, Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax, and Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) tax and must be reported on Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. See Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer’s Tax Guide, for information on the withholding, depositing, reporting, and paying of employment taxes.  Q-12: Is a payment made using virtual currency subject to information reporting?  A-12: A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.  For example, a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment of fixed and determinable income using virtual currency with a value of $600 or more to a U.S. non-exempt recipient in a taxable year is required to report the payment to the IRS and to the payee. Examples of payments of fixed and determinable income include rent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, and compensation.  Q-13: Is a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment using virtual currency worth $600 or more to an independent contractor for performing services required to file an information return with the IRS?  A-13: Generally, a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment of $600 or more in a taxable year to an independent contractor for the performance of services is required to report that payment to the IRS and to the payee on Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income. Payments of virtual currency required to be reported on Form 1099-MISC should be reported using the fair market value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date of payment.  The payment recipient may have income even if the recipient does not receive a Form 1099-MISC. See the Instructions to Form 1099-MISC and the General Instructions for Certain Information Returns for more information. For payments to non-U.S. persons, see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities.  Q-14: Are payments made using virtual currency subject to backup withholding?  A-14: Payments made using virtual currency are subject to backup withholding to the same extent as other payments made in property. Therefore, payors making reportable payments using virtual currency must solicit a taxpayer identification number (TIN) from the payee.  The payor must backup withhold from the payment if a TIN is not obtained prior to payment or if the payor receives notification from the IRS that backup withholding is required. See Publication 1281, Backup Withholding for Missing and Incorrect Name/TINs, for more information.  Q-15: Are there IRS information reporting requirements for a person who settles payments made in virtual currency on behalf of merchants that accept virtual currency from their customers?  A-15: Yes, if certain requirements are met. In general, a third party that contracts with a substantial number of unrelated merchants to settle payments between the merchants and their customers is a third party settlement organization (TPSO).  A TPSO is required to report payments made to a merchant on a Form 1099-K, Payment Card and Third Party Network Transactions, if, for the calendar year, both (1) the number of transactions settled for the merchant exceeds 200, and (2) the gross amount of payments made to the merchant exceeds $20,000.  When completing Boxes 1, 3, and 5a-1 on the Form 1099-K, transactions where the TPSO settles payments made with virtual currency are aggregated with transactions where the TPSO settles payments made with real currency to determine the total amounts to be reported in those boxes. When determining whether the transactions are reportable, the value of the virtual currency is the fair market value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars on the date of payment.  See The Third Party Information Reporting Center, http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Third-Party-Reporting-Information-Center, for more information on reporting transactions on Form 1099-K.  Q-16: Will taxpayers be subject to penalties for having treated a virtual currency transaction in a manner that is inconsistent with this notice prior to March 25, 2014?  A-16: Taxpayers may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with tax laws. For example, underpayments attributable to virtual currency transactions may be subject to penalties, such as accuracy-related penalties under section 6662.

42377048,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPwP,1395769597,Moolah Founder Accidentally Donates 20 Million Dogecoin to Sponsor NASCAR Driver,"The founder of Moolah, a cryptographic payment platform, yesterday donated too much moolah (sorry) to a dogecoin fundraising campaign.  Alex Green had intended to give 2 million dogecoin to support the reddit community’s effort to put a dogecoin car in NASCAR. By chance he typed an extra zero, raising the amount to 20 million dogecoin – or $15,000.  However, Green is standing by his generous donation and took to reddit to raise the stakes even higher:  Was meant to be 2M…. silly keyboard. I will stand by my mistake however! Anybody care to match me? The first person to match at least 10% will receive a hot pass to Talladega.  Team Spirit  Josh Wise is the driver being sponsored by the campaign, he drives the No. 98 Chevrolet SS in the Sprint Cup Series. Until the dogecoin community stepped in, he didn’t have a sponsor.  It takes $55,000 to sponsor a car. If the Doge4Nascar campaign is able to raise the 67,500,000 dogecoin needed (which the donation page suggests it has) then they will wrap his car in doge design. There is also a paintjob contest being conducted on reddit to pick the best design.  The Doge4Nascar campaign made the disclaimer that if they couldn't raise the money needed for NASCAR, then the donations would go to another charity.  However, that won't be necessary; after Green's donation the fundraising effort reached 82% of its goal. The current total now stands at 100.47%.  It looks like Wise is going to be racing a Doge car and he seems to be quite keen about the prospect, too.  This isn’t the first time the dogecoin community has showed their support and generosity for a sporting team. In January, they raised $25,000 to help the Jamaican bobsleigh team attend the Winter Olypics in Sochi. The Jamaican team had qualified for the first time since 2002, but they did not have the funds to support themselves. Team pilot Winston Watt set up a PayPal account and sought crowdfunding. It was soon filled with 26 million dogecoin.  Costly Mistakes  Green’s one-time donation for Wise is just 6 million dogecoin short of the entire Jamaican Olympics campaign.  While Green is standing by his error, he isn’t the first to accidentally enter one too many zeros while making a cryptocurrency transaction.  “The dumbest mistake you’ve made with bitcoin” thread on reddit is full of stories of folks who copy-pasted the wrong address or added one too many zeros at the end of their intended amount.  Even PayPal has been affected – accidentally adding $92 quadrillion to a man’s account last year (that’s more than the world’s annual GDP).

42377037,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPmL,1395765687,Tera Group Hopes to Offer First Bitcoin Swap,"The world's first bitcoin swap could be just days away, provided Tera Group Inc has its way.  The startup derivatives exchange claims to have created the first bitcoin swap and hopes the new derivative will allow financial institutions to hedge the volatility of bitcoin.  Tera says it has already constructed the terms for a multi-million dollar swap between two US institutions which would hedge the value of bitcoin against the US dollar.  In layman's terms, if betting on derivatives does not get your adrenaline pumping, betting on bitcoin volatility probably should.  Standard swap framework with bitcoin on top  Tera says the legal framework behind its bitcoin swap is more or less standard. Institutions can make transactions at a specified bitcoin exchange rate against any currency and hedge the exchange rate for a specified period of time. The initial transaction agreement is a 25-day affair.  However, it also points out that this type of transaction is not regulated, hence its availability will be privately arranged and over the counter. Tera is seeking permission from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to offer a similar swap instrument on a regulated marketplace.  Said Tera President and co-founder Leonard T. Nuara:  ""The infrastructure and regulatory protocols already exist in the conventional OTC swaps markets to support these hedging instruments. [...] Regulatory approval is crucial to the long-term growth of the market utilizing bitcoin.""  If Tera gets the green light, it plans to offer bitcoin swaps on TeraExchange, which is a CFTC regulated swap execution facility.  More questions than answers  The problem with Tera's plans is that regulatory approval might not be forthcoming. For the time being, it is not clear whether the CFTC even has authority over digital currencies and fancy financial products built on top of them.  Tera says it has provided the CFTC with information about its swap framework and that it is actively seeking approval, but won't make much of a difference if the CFTC concludes it has nothing to do with digital currencies. If, on the other hand, it decides to treat bitcoin and other digital currencies like commodities, Tera might get regulatory approval after all.  Tera CEO and co-founder Christian Martin argues bitcoin swaps could be an ""inflection point"" in the evolution of cryptocurrencies.  ""There is incredible momentum and support behind this alternative global currency. But even with all this excitement it is critical that the market participants have tools at their disposal to hedge their price risk.""  In theory, a bitcoin swap would make a lot of sense, as it would allow reluctant investors to employ an effective hedge when dealing with bitcoin.  For example, merchants could protect their interests against a sudden drop in bitcoin value, allowing them to accept bitcoin payments and hold bitcoins without many of the risks associated with volatility.  A swap would allow them to take volatility out of the equation, while speculators could effectively buy the risk and reap the potential windfall, or take a hit of the price goes down.

42377047,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPyv,1395763383,Poll: Vast Majority in US Would Rather Invest in Gold than Bitcoin,"Although almost half of US citizens know what bitcoin is, only 13% would choose it over gold as an investment vehicle, suggests a new survey.  The poll – which received responses from 2,039 adults aged 18 and over – was conducted by Harris Interactive, in partnership with a financial management company Yodlee back in December 2013.  Although more people in the Western states knew what bitcoin was, that knowledge didn't necessarily translate into a desire for adoption. For example, a leading 55% of people in the West were familiar with bitcoin, however only 7% of them would invest in BTC over gold.  Gold vs bitcoin  Gold was used as the comparative investment vehicle over bitcoin in the survey, and the results showed that the average person would prefer to invest in gold over bitcoin by a large margin.  Furthermore, of those who did have a knowledge of bitcoin, most still didn't want to invest in the digital currency, with only 13% saying that they would invest in the digital currency over gold.  In terms of gender, 14% of men compared with 10% of women would choose bitcoin as an investment over gold.  The survey's summary report suggests that Americans, as a result of this particular poll, have a low level of trust in bitcoin. However, it may simply be that many do not have enough information to make an informed investment decision.  In a statement, Yodlee's Senior VP of Operations and Information Security Tim O'Brien said:  ""Bitcoin will be hard for consumers to understand and trust on a large scale until secure, user-friendly tools and services emerge to make it as convenient and safe as possible to use.”  Reluctant on regulation  When asked if bitcoin regulation by governments was a good idea, the vast proportion of people who knew what bitcoin was disagreed, or were not sure.  Geography plays some role in attitudes towards regulation, it seems. The survey found that people in the Northeast (28%), or in the West (30%), were much more inclined to believe that bitcoin should be regulated than in the Midwest (only 16%).  Looking at respondents' ages revealed that 39% of adults aged 18-34, and 42% of men aged 18-34, would not advocate the government regulation of bitcoin. These figures drop with age, the poll discovered, with 28% of those aged 45-54, and 24% aged 55 and over, saying that they did not want to see bitcoin regulated.  Yet, as a whole, the fact that less than a quarter of survey respondents said that bitcoin should be regulated could be seen as a good sign. It may indicate that, despite the number of negative stories about bitcoin in the media, Americans are still largely keeping an open mind.  Other findings  When it looked at the backgrounds of the respondents, that survey found that the more money a person made, the more familiar they were with bitcoin. Sixty-one per cent of those with a household income of over $100,000 per year had heard of bitcoin – higher than the figures for the average person (48%).  Furthermore, people living in the Northeastern states of the US were more knowledgeable about bitcoin, according to the survey. This is perhaps because of the concentration of financial professionals in that particular area, especially in New York City.  Despite some positive findings, however, investment interest in bitcoin seems to be very low. The percentages (by age bracket) of people who would invest in bitcoin over gold were:  18-34: 20%  35-44: 12%  45-54: 13%  55-64: 7%  65+: 8%  Other surveys that have polled people about bitcoin have been generally more positive than this one conducted by Harris Interactive and Yodlee.  One survey that found 57% of UK citizens know about bitcoin, another that 51% of 'techies' are happy being paid in bitcoin, and a third that 57% of young Americans believe that bitcoin boosts the global economy.

Running from 2nd-6th November, Money2020, which this year features the (Bit)coinWorld track, will provide the digital currency community with a platform to raise awareness about distributed payment protocols, showcase the ecosystem's newest innovators and hold networking events.  Last year's event featured more than 440 speakers from across the financial industry, including such notable names from the digital currency community as Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase; angel investor Roger Ver; Ripple CEO Chris Larsen; BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi; and Tradehill CEO Jered Kenna.  Money2020 indicated that the Winklevoss brothers were selected for the speaking slot due to their demonstrated commitment to the future of distributed payment technologies and industry involvement.    Said Simran Rekhi Aggarwal, co-founder and president of Money2020:      ""Cameron and Tyler are high-profile industry executives who have been thorough and thoughtful in their involvement with bitcoin. As stakeholders and visionaries in this space, we feel they offer a unique perspective to engage and inspire our large, diverse and senior audience.""            Sponsors for this year's event include American Express, PayPal, BitPay and Google Wallet, among others.  Money2020 bolsters digital currency coverage  Aggarwal told CoinDesk that Money2020 will be expanding its coverage this year to focus more broadly on distributed payment protocols and digital currencies, not simply bitcoin.  Said Aggarwal:  ""We believe they’re important new technologies that hold the potential for disruptive innovation in payments and financial services.""  The event exec went on to say that Money2020 would serve to ""cross-pollinate"" innovators in the digital currency space with like-minded individuals taking similar approaches to the mainstream evolution of money.  Added Aggarwal: ""That’s one of the key benefits of being at Money2020, and something we feel the entire ecosystem of innovators in money need to do more.""  Winklevoss brothers take the stage  Given that the Winklevoss brothers are the largest single investors in bitcoin, they have become a staple presence at bitcoin events, taking prominent roles at Bitcoin 2013 and at this January's New York bitcoin hearings  In addition to their industry expertise, Money2020 noted that the Winklevosses' recent high-profile endeavors such as their bitcoin pricing index Winklevoss Index or Winkdex, and the yet-to-be-approved exchange-traded fund, Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, bolstered their qualifications for the headlining position.  About Money2020  One of the largest financial conferences on the annual calendar, Money2020 expects to draw more than 6,000 attendees from 50 countries, including more than 500 industry-leading CEOs in 2014.

He is expected to speak about his vision for the future of bitcoin; its potential for global financial inclusion; non-currency uses like proving ownership of stocks and bonds; and the network's relation to society as a whole.  Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, said:  ""We are delighted to have one of bitcoin’s most prominent and prescient champions at our conference. Patrick’s decision to accept bitcoin has introduced it to mainstream society and increased understanding among consumers.""  He added: ""It’s going to be a great event; this conference is where visionary technology and mainstream commerce intersects.""  Welcome advocate  Byrne has become a poster boy for bitcoin since announcing that Overstock.com would start accepting bitcoins in an offhand interview remark last December. Feeling pressure to deliver, he did exactly that with some intensive help by payment processing partner Coinbase, six months ahead of schedule.  Since then, the self-confessed libertarian and Austrian Economist has become one of bitcoin's biggest advocates. The first major online retailer to accept bitcoin, Overstock.com made more than $124,000 in bitcoin sales in its first day of accepting the currency, and by March had topped $1m in purchases.  The company has revised its bitcoin revenue projection for 2014 from an initial $3-5m to a jaw-dropping $20m.  ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency inventions reduce costs for businesses – small or large – and thus enables firms to pass savings onto consumers,"" said Byrne earlier in the year.  ""In addition, bitcoin shares the key virtue of gold: it is a form of money that cannot be easily manipulated or debased by central planners.""

42377044,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPq7,1395749799,European Central Bank: Bitcoin Shouldn't be Ignored or Dismissed,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has reiterated its position on digital currencies.  In a speech delivered at the at the ECB/Banca d’Italia Workshop on Interchange Fees, Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, said digital currencies are still too small to have an impact on retail payments and central banks.  Mersch reiterated what the ECB said two years ago in its Virtual Currency Schemes report, published in October 2012.  In the meantime digital currencies have gained quite a following, although they are still not even close to what could be described as 'mainstream'. In any case they are gaining popularity and as a result regulators around the world are starting to take notice.  Last December the European Banking Authority (EBA) issued a warning on potential risks related to virtual currencies, focusing on fraud and theft.  For its part, the ECB has remained silent on the matter since its 2012 report.  Phenomenon that shouldn't be ignored  However, this time around Mersch stressed that digital currencies should not be ignored despite their relatively small impact on the economy. Keep in mind that Mersch was talking about retail payments and interchange fees, hence the limited focus on other cryptocurrency-related issues.  ""Many media commentators have been wondering what impact these currencies will have on retail payments and even on central banks. I agree that virtual currency schemes are an interesting phenomenon and should not be ignored or dismissed,"" he said.  ""The ECB was one of the first public authorities to see their potential and their risks and published a detailed analysis in 2012. Despite the overall rise in the value of bitcoin since the publication of the report and the media attention it is getting, our conclusions still seem to be valid, namely, that such currencies are not (at least yet) economically important.""  He went on to conclude that cryptocurrencies do not pose a serious risk to price stability or financial stability in Europe, but they do pose a risk for users, which is what European central banks and the EBA have been saying for months.  Interestingly, Mersch made a clear distinction between speculative investments in bitcoin and the use of bitcoin for payments.  ""However, this user risk is more related to speculative investments and consumer protection, and not necessarily to payments. Nevertheless, we are closely following developments and keeping in touch with other authorities,"" he said.  A risk for retail?  Mersch said novel and unconventional challenges are facing regulators, but he did not offer any thoughts on digital currency regulation. The fact that he clearly singled out payments as a safer niche for bitcoin is encouraging, especially given the tone of his address and the focus on retail.  Consumer protection remains an issue in many situations, but in theory it could be addressed by bitcoin payment processors and merchants to some extent, although many argue that nothing short of real regulation will solve the problem.  Protection offers and buyer recourse are important for merchants and consumers alike. Merchants aren't exposed to financial risk if there is no protection in place, but they do stand to lose credibility or risk their reputation if something goes wrong.  At the same time, consumers cannot be expected to pay for big-ticket items using a payment method that effectively strips them of consumer protection. Both parties stand to gain from lower transaction fees: merchants can increase margins, while at the same time passing part of the savings down to consumers.  Sadly though, regulatory ambiguity and uncertainty are two sizeable hurdles that won't be overcome anytime soon.

Last week, there was speculation on social media that 400 ATMs had arrived in Dubai. In response to an earlier BitAccess announcement, Sergey Yusupov tweeted a photo of the machines and noted that they would be activated in two weeks.    @BitAccess welcome to #Dubai but 400 #BitcoinATM are already here and will be activated in 2 weeks! pic.twitter.com/0i1duhCCXq      — Sergey Yusupov (@uniqbiun) March 18, 2014    However, the UAE Department of Economic Development (DED) told Emirates 24|7 that Dubai had not given bitcoin ATMs the green light just yet.  ""DED has not issued any license relating to bitcoin so far,"" said Ahmed Ibrahim, Director of Business Registration at the DED.  The Dubai bitcoin community is active and growing, but there aren't many places in Dubai where to use the digital currency. In fact, The Pizza Guys is the only merchant accepting bitcoin in the city at the moment. They are also hosting the next meet up on March 31st.  Same same but different  Emirates 24|7 also reported that these kiosks, which were poised to be bitcoin ATMs, were in fact ManGo kiosks, a system to pay bills for local and international services. The touch-screen interface of these machines lets the user pay their bills in just a few touches.  The ManGo design and size is similar to BitAccess ATMs, thus explaining why Yusupov may have confused them for bitcoin ATMs.  But, this doesn’t mean that BitAccess ATMs aren’t coming to Dubai at all. The Ottawa-based company tweeted that they will be putting out news on ATMs in the UAE soon:    @Parag1301 we will be putting out a news soon as soon as details are finalized. #bitcoinAtm #dubai #btm #bitcoin #uae - join the launch      — Bit Access (@BitAccess) March 23, 2014    However, they are unlikely to send anything close to 400 machines.

ZipZap CEO Alan Safahi told CoinDesk the company had not ended its relationship with PayPoint, adding that it was still working with them for non-digital currency clients, and to add more payment locations. He said such issues were a fact of life for bitcoin businesses who needed to operate within the traditional fiat world. He added:  ""They only halted digital currency processing until they have better legal clarification from government which we hope to have within weeks. Meanwhile, we are pursuing other options as well.""  Cash for bitcoins  ZipZap had allowed customers to buy bitcoins with cash by first registering at its site and verifying ID, printing out a barcode on a payment slip and then taking it to a cashier at a physical location to hand over the money.  The service operated in five countries and customers could also login via existing accounts with Bittylicious, BuyBitcoin.sg and BIPS Market, using exchanges ANXBTC and ANXPRO. ZipZap had plans to also include Kraken, CoinMKT and BTCX.se.  There were 28,000 physical stores for customers to pay – all of them PayPoint clients.  Processor stopped deposits  PayPoint had reportedly halted deposits to ZipZap until the UK government and the financial conduct authority provide legal clarity on digital currencies.  Though the process of printing slips and visiting a store might seem a cumbersome way to acquire such currency, it remained simpler and much less risky then dealing with online bitcoin exchanges.  Identity and address verification requirements for exchanges have increased markedly in the past year and even seasoned bitcoin users have become reluctant to trust them with large amounts of money or customers' personal banking details.  ZipZap allowed customers to transact within their own country, as long as it was one of the five, and with registered businesses.  Banks OK, others still wary  The company had apparently had no problems with its partners in the traditional banking world, but payment processors like PayPoint and PayPal have been treading far more cautiously with digital currency related activities.  If a solution cannot be found with PayPoint, there may still be other payment processing options for ZipZap in the UK. There hasn't been any overt pressure from the UK's authorities for either financial institutions or the public to avoid bitcoin transactions.  Despite hints about eliminating sales tax, there is also no legislation related to bitcoin in the UK as yet, which appears to leave businesses free to try new models but which can actually stifle innovation, as entrepreneurs and investors become reluctant to enter the unknown territory.  ZipZap, still a relatively new business, has been trying to grow across the UK and other European markets. However, it may now focus on other overseas markets (like the US) after finding Europe's environment too challenging.  The company's site lists its headquarters in San Francisco, and it also has operations in India and Argentina.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/25/uk-cash-for-bitcoin-service-zipzap-suspends-btc-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8b5db9283990789763991d2a484c452bb7d42d3-1011x652.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377042,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6wPv9,1395734715,Developers Battle Over Bitcoin Block Chain,"It's surprising what worm-filled cans a new version of the bitcoin protocol will open. The core developers released a much-anticipated update to the core software - version 0.9.0 - last week. Now, a third-party developer group is already lobbying for change.  Counterparty  , a financial trading platform built on the bitcoin block chain, issued an open letter to the Bitcoin protocol's core developers last week, urging them to reconsider a key component of the protocol's latest release. That component is called OP_RETURN, and it is a new feature designed to allow people to store extra data in the block chain.  OP_RETURN was originally meant to store 80 bytes of extra data in a bitcoin transaction, but the core developers slashed it to 40 bytes. This upset Counterparty, because as a financial trading platform that allows people to create new asset classes and financial derivatives to be traded on the bitcoin block chain, it says that it needed those 80 bytes to store its data.  ""A 40 byte limit (in place of the 80 bytes originally planned) makes OP_RETURN unusable for Counterparty’s purposes,"" said the letter.  The other option is to use another feature of the Bitcoin protocol, called multi-signature outputs. These involve more than one signature for a particular bitcoin transaction, and are designed for features such as escrow payments. But that second signature can be used to store data instead.  ""If the data cap is left at 40 bytes, we will be forced to use such awkward constructions to accomplish our goals,"" the Counterparty letter said. Instead, the organization wants the core devs to play ball, and restore the original 80-byte cap.  In a discussion on the Bitcoin Talk forum, core developer Jeff Garzik makes an argument for why they shouldn't. He warns that when a transaction is processed on the bitcoin network, everyone processes it, which means that the data you're storing has to be stored by everyone.  ""It is called a free ride. Given that the overwhelming majority -- >90% -- application for the bitcoin blockchain is currency use, using full nodes as dumb data storage terminals is simply abusing an all-volunteer network resource,"" he argues.  He accuses Counterparty and Mastercoin - another service that also uses the block chain for its own purposes - of having ""simply flipped an 'on' switch and started using bitcoin P2P nodes as unwanted data stores."" And they didn't engage the community before doing it either, he complains.  Get off of my block  Is it really the core developers' job to make it possible for others to build extra services on top of the block chain? It had better, if it wants to stay relevant, says 'PhantomPhreak', a core developer for Counterparty.  PhantomPhreak argues that both parties get something from this kind of relationship. By piggybacking on the bitcoin block chain, Counterparty and other new services get pre-baked services including trusted timestamping, proof of publication, peer discovery and anti-DOS measures.  Bitcoin, in turn, gets to stay relevant, (s)he argues: ""Bitcoin can be very conservative with the kinds of functionality that it directly supports, while still rapidly acquiring the new features that it needs to stay relevant and useful.""  So now, Counterparty (which hasn't contributed to the bitcoin core's open source effort), and the bitcoin core (which has stated that it needs people using the protocol to pitch in) are stuck with each other, and neither is happy. Phantomphreak says that ""a few of the Bitcoin developers are trying to prevent us from using the protocol as it stands, with all of the flexibility that it naturally provides.""  Core developer Mike Hearn has an idea to cut through the whole tangled mess. In fact, he had it in 2012, before Counterparty or Mastercoin even existed. Instead of trying to store lots of data in a special field in the block chain, why not simply store a pointer to a third party, P2P data storage pool, he asks? This could be achieved using something called a distributed hash table (DHT).  ""That way it doesn't matter how much data you want to store, the impact to the block chain is always the same,"" Hearn says. ""Nobody is against that - it's why OP_RETURN is sized to allow for hashes. DHTs come in conveniently reusable libraries so it's hardly a big engineering challenge. Instead they turned it into some kind of stupid political fight.""  Talking of fights, more tensions emerged among the core devs last week, and they're indirectly related to this question of who gets to use the block chain for what, and why.  0.9.0 reduced the transaction fees - the money paid to get a message processed by the network - tenfold. This is a good way to encourage microtransactions on the network by keeping the costs of a single transaction low, so that you could, say, pay pennies for downloading a single story.  Peter Todd, a contributor to the bitcoin code, told CoinDesk that he was worried that this would open the network up to spam and denial of service attacks, because people could use the cheap transaction fees to flood the network.  [post-quote]  Gavin Andresen, the Bitcoin Foundation's chief scientist and lead developer of Bitcoin Core, says that there are plenty of ways to slow down bitcoin transactions with DoS attacks - but he argues that they generally don't happen, primarily because the attackers would have little to gain. ""I have never said that bitcoin is directly suitable for transactions less than a dollar; I think the jury is still out on how low we can go,"" he says.  Vitalik Buterin, developer of the soon-to-be-launched Ethereum project, argues that the concepts of transaction fees and storing messages on the block chain are connected. Transactions are badly thought out in the bitcoin protocol, he says. Some core developers have admitted this to CoinDesk, which is why they're working to change it using 'smart' fees.  If transactions were better managed, then people could just pay for what they wanted to store, Buterin says. Then, there would be no 'free rides'.  ""It's the protocol's fault the OPRETURN battle is such an issue. In an ideal world, the concept of 'abuse' would not even exist; fees would be mandatory, and carefully structured to closely match the actual cost that a given transaction imposes on the network,"" he says. ""If you can pay the fees for what you're doing then you should be able to do it, no questions asked.""  It doesn't seem as though the core developers are about to change the OP_RETURN parameters to allow more data to be stored in the network. If they don't, then Counterparty has some options.  It can hack together an inelegant use of the multi-signature protocol to store its data. It can explore Hearn's idea of using pointers and distributed hash tables. Or it can simply jump ship and either build its own block chain, or use someone else's service. Perhaps Ethereum's for example.  But, PhantomPhreak isn't ready for that. ""Ethereum is not really an alternative to Bitcoin for our purposes,"" PhantomPhreak told CoinDesk. It isn't tried and tested yet, the anonymous developer contends.  For now then, at least, some forward-thinking initaitives that want to expand beyond bitcoin's core services still feel as though they need the bitcoin protocol to do it. And it looks as though that's going to generate tensions, workarounds and in-fighting for some time to come.
