42433316,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4Qfh,1607031741,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Lingers Around $19.4K While ETH/BTC Pairing Hits Bull Mode,"The price of bitcoin is trending up in a low-volume environment. Meanwhile, some rebalancing from bitcoin into ether has been occurring on exchanges since late November.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $19,363 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $18,809-$19,607  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The bitcoin market is back to trending towards bullish territory after a flat Wednesday made it clear traders were taking a bit of a breather. The price was able to go as high as $19,607 but lost steam at $19,363, as of press time.      Thursday’s even tighter range than the previous 24 hours is a symptom of lower-than-average volume. According to exchange data from the CoinDesk 20, daily volume was at $990 million as of press time, lower than Wednesday’s $1.3 billion daily volume and the past month’s $1.5 billion average.      Optimism abounds that more fundamentally positive news combined with market dynamics will lead the world’s oldest cryptocurrency higher.      “I was explaining to my non-crypto colleagues today that the supply and demand imbalance is just incredible,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “We’re seeing some institutional buyers pick up large amounts fairly frequently, so the others will also be seeing that [and asking] where are they getting the coins from?”      The dry powder is out there in the form of miner wallets. Their balances have increased over the course of 2020, with Lubian.com, F2Pool, BinancePool and Poolin collectively holding over 33,000 BTC, according to data aggregator Glassnode.      “Miners need to cover their operating costs,” Thomas added. “So for me, it’s clear we’re going to continue going higher in a fairly convincing way for quite some time yet.”      “I am totally convinced we are a couple of weeks into a bull market surge of as big proportions as the last one,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a crypto over-the-counter trader. “Bitcoin will fly past the all-time high very soon and I would be surprised if we don’t see a $30,000 bitcoin before summer.”      That’s a hyperbullish statement from a hardcore bitcoiner, but Kugelberg also cautioned that wild gyrations are likely in the days ahead for the crypto market. “It will be a very bumpy ride with drops of 20% to 30% every now and then,” Kugelberg added. “It’s bitcoin and the [amplifier volume] knob goes to 11. If I had time I’d try to surf the waves as a day trader, but I leave that to others.”      Bitcoin’s overall volatility has been creeping upward since October and traders will continue to keep an eye on that metric in this overall bull market.      While attention seems to be on bitcoin in this market atmosphere, it’s not the only story in the crypto markets, noted Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto brokerage BeQuant.      Read More: Ether Eyed as Value Play With Bitcoin Pressing $20K      ""The focus may be on bitcoin and its seemingly inevitable run up to $20,000, but ETH looks to be well-positioned for further upside,” Vinokourov told CoinDesk.    ETH/BTC goes bullish    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $611 and climbing 2.3% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Why Ethereum and Bitcoin Are Very Different Investments      The ETH/BTC pair, which is offered on most major cryptocurrency exchanges, has been trending bullish on the daily charts by technical analysis standards. Since late November its price has been above major moving averages. This suggests investors are willing to spend some bitcoin to scoop up ether.      Michael Rabkin, head of institutional sales for crypto trading firm DV Chain, says bitcoin is and will remain the crypto bellwether no matter what happens to ether and that this pattern likely reflects bitcoiners will continue to offload profits into ETH during this bull run.      “With regards to ETH and BTC, we strongly believe that BTC is the overall market driver,” Rabkin told CoinDesk. “You will have outlier days for sure where BTC is down and ETH is up but mostly BTC drives the price of the overall crypto market, ether included.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Thursday, mostly green. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    ethereum classic (ETC) + 4%  cardano (ADA) + 3.3%  orchid (OXT) + 2.2%    Notable losers:    omg network (OMG) - 3%  chainlink (LINK) - 1.2%  kyber network (KNC) - 1%    Read More: Ripple CEO Walks Back Threat to Leave US      Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 closed flat, in the green 0.03% as investors participated in some profit taking amid gains in the real estate, consumer and industrial sectors.

His remarks were reported by Reuters.      Jessop added that while bitcoin’s volatility prevents it from acting as a reliable way to store value, “aspirationally” it could be one, and “that’s one of the reasons why so many investors are now thinking about this space constructively.”      Currently, low trading volumes seem to have kept bitcoin hovering around $19,000 after touching its all-time high of $19,850 last week.      While sharp price movements in a market can often scare investors because volatility gets conflated with risk, what’s unique about bitcoin’s volatility is that unlike the volatility index (VIX) for the S&P 500, bitcoin’s VIX tends to be positively correlated with the asset’s price.

Data from analytics service CryptoQuant shows that the amount of tetherheld in OKEx wallets has dropped to 6.69 million from 275.0 million between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, down 97.6% in less than a week. Malta-based exchange OKEx has a large user base in China and tether, the world's largest dollar-backed token, with total assets of $19.35 billion, is one of the most popular stablecoins used by Chinese traders.      At the same time, total daily trading volume on OKEx has declined significantly during the same time period – down approximately 67.7% from Nov. 25, according to data compiled by CoinDesk. The volume of tether traded on OKEx plunged 70%.      Traders often use stablecoins as an intermediary step in order to buy riskier crypto assets. After individuals purchase stablecoins with U.S. dollars or other government-issued currencies, exchanges are usually the platform where the stablecoins go to be traded for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether or others.      The Chinese government prohibited local crypto exchanges from allowing trades between crypto assets and the Chinese yuan in 2017, but people can still trade renminbi into stablecoins through over-the-counter (OTC) desks.    Steep drops    The collapse of trading volume does not appear to be a mere lull in interest, especially considering bitcoin is near its all-time highs and other cryptocurrencies have been rallying.      The sudden and significant decline in tether in reserves on OKEx could indicate that users are transferring their stablecoins elsewhere – possibly to a different exchange or to their private cold wallets, according to analysts and traders who spoke with CoinDesk.      “[It’s] just folks withdrawing, I think,” Darius Sit from Singapore-based QCP Capital told CoinDesk. “They don’t want to keep assets in OKEx.”      Chinese users’ alternatives to OKEx have also had similar problems amid a recent government crackdown on exchanges.      However, during the same time period, the tether reserve on Huobi logged a small increase, according to data from CryptoQuant, although the same metric dropped slightly on Binance. While legally based in Seychelles, Huobi also focuses on China-based customers, as does Binance, which isn't clear on its location.      A spokesperson for OKEx said CryptoQuant's data did not match the firm's internal records, but OKEx has yet to provide their own figures.      Nonetheless, data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode also shows that a substantial amount of tether and other stablecoins have left the exchange in the past week.      OKEx currently supports seven stablecoins on its platform: USDT, USDC, dai, Paxos standard (PAX), TUSD, USDK and GUSD.      According to Glassnode data, balances of USDC and PAX on OKEx have also dropped sharply in the past week.      In a recent ask-me-anything (AMA) session, OKEx CEO Jay Hao said the freezing of OKEx’s crypto withdrawals was harmful for his company and that as a result trading volumes have dropped.      “We have seen an understandable decrease in trading activity on the exchange,” Hao said.      Hao did not explain why the backups of the crypto private keys could not be used during the freeze. According to OKEx, the suspension of all cryptocurrency withdrawals was due to one of its keyholders being “out of touch” with the exchange after it was “cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations.”",NEGATIVE,USDT,EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | USDT | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/03/okexs-trading-volumes-and-tether-reserve-plunge-on-possible-user-exodus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68ec92bd18332949ff7cca3ba4e04b356c20feb8-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433313,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4QXh,1607025659,Wrapped Bitcoin ‘Burns’ Increase as Traders Rotate Capital Out of Cooling DeFi,"Wrapped bitcoin, the bitcoin-backed token on Ethereum now worth over $2 billion, has seen an increase in burns (or “unwrappings”) by some of its largest users as the Ethereum-based decentralized finance sector continues to cool.      BitGo clients including Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research are exchanging an increasing amount of their tokenized bitcoins minted earlier this year for real bitcoins as the bullish cryptocurrency market continues to center on bitcoin and Ethereum’s decentralized finance takes a back seat for now.      “In general, the yield has dipped in DeFi and the increased trading on centralized exchanges directed our needs to do so,” said Lan Gu, quantitative trader at Alameda Research, in a direct message with CoinDesk.      In the months following DeFi’s red-hot summer when bitcoins were wrapped faster than they were mined, the sector has cooled significantly and yields across various Ethereum-based protocols have subsequently dropped.      Alameda’s WBTC burns are also partially the result of shifts in their OTC order flow and internal capital base readjustment as the price of bitcoin continues to climb, the firm told CoinDesk.      Another catalyst for the increase in burns could be the sunsetting of liquidity rewards program for leading decentralized exchange Uniswap on Nov. 17, giving users less of an incentive to keep funds on the platform, according to Kiarash Mosayeri, wrapped bitcoin product manager at BitGo. Talking to CoinDesk, Mosayeri said the recent WBTC burns “were expected.”      To date, nearly 120,000 WBTC are still in circulation with over 8,000 WBTC minted in November. A record 4,300 WBTC were burned over the same period, however. Nearly 2,000 more were also burned in the first few days of December with no new minting.      Three Arrows Capital, another prominent wrapped bitcoin merchant that burned over 4,000 WBTC in the past two weeks, declined to comment on why they “unwrapped” these coins. The Singapore-based trading firm has not minted new WBTC since mid-October, per BitGo’s wrapped bitcoin order book.      The market capitalization of wrapped bitcoin is above $2.3 billion at last check.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/03/wrapped-bitcoin-burns-increase-as-traders-rotate-capital-out-of-cooling-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/116eed40c0ea3a906f8fb5614bf91f8552b825c9-854x579.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433311,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4QRh,1607022022,Terra Brings 24-Hour Trading to Synthetic Versions of Stocks Like TSLA and AAPL,"The creators of stablecoin platform Terra announced the launch of the Mirror Protocol Thursday, a way to mint crypto assets that mimic the value of shares in publicly traded companies like Apple or Tesla.      ""We were motivated to create a way for retail investors around the globe to more easily participate in the U.S. equities market,"" Do Kwon, CEO of Terraform Labs, the company behind Terra, said in a press release.      The new protocol will also bring a new liquidity mining opportunity to Terra's Tendermint-based blockchain. Terra previously announced a savings account with a yield farming spin.      Known as mAssets, these tokens will track the price of U.S.-based equities in the real stock market, using an oracle system that's able to check prices every six seconds. Much like MakerDAO, if a stock price were to go up against its underlying collateral, that could trigger a slashing event for a given crypto asset (unless the collateral depositor increases their stake). But U.S. equities also don't tend to move as quickly as crypto.      Arrington XRP Capital has invested in Terra and all its related projects. The firm shared an advance draft of a report on the opportunity Terra has entered with Mirror called ""The Standard For Synthetic Assets: Mirror, DeFi's 1-To-N Opportunity.""      The report notes that in uncertain times there's global demand for dollar-denominated assets like those created by Mirror.      ""It represents a unique alternative to centralized exchanges and e-brokerage platforms, with 24/7, on-chain, capital-efficient minting, settlement and trading of U.S. equities,"" the report contends.    Hungry for imitations    The synthetic exchange Synthetix pioneered synthetic asset creation in crypto. To mint a synthetic on Synthetix however requires a 750% collateralization ratio in SNX tokens, due to the fact that its token is prone to the same volatility as most cryptocurrencies.      Minting a synthetic equity on Mirror, however, only requires users staking 150% of its value in one of Terra's various stablecoins, thanks to the low-volatility of these assets. (These assets can also be minted using other mAssets as a stake, but they then require a 200% stake.)      Those lower collateralization rates make Mirror more capital-efficient, though of course if a creator expects an equity's value to rise they will want to over-collateralize.      Better capital efficiency goes hand-in-hand with another advantage Mirror creates: decentralized options against U.S. equities. A permissionless platform for options against U.S. equities should be attractive for crypto's growing retail market.      ""The retail investor is at the center of this growing demand for U.S. equities and global equity derivatives. The stock market is no longer the exclusive purview of Wall Street's suits, whether in New York, London or Tokyo,"" Arrington XRP argues in its report.      While there's no direct benefit to the Terra team from this new protocol, its design should drive additional demand for its stablecoins.    Growth token    To govern the Mirror Protocol, Terra has also announced a fair launch of a governance token called MIR.      MIR will be distributed at a constant rate over a four-year period to users who contribute liquidity to automated market makers (AMMs) trading mAssets or trading MIR itself on Terra's Terraswap or on Ethereum's Uniswap. Mirror has specific interfaces for providing liquidity to pools either on Ethereum or Terra's own chain. Only pools that pair the assets with TerraUSD will be eligible for MIR.      MIR will have a fixed supply of 360 million.      Of that 9.15 million will be distributed to UNI holders in an initial airdrop, with the same amount to LUNA holders (the token that enables Terra stablecoins to maintain their peg). There will also be an ongoing staking reward to LUNA holders, as well as a set aside for a development fund for MIR governance to spend as it sees fit.      Over the next four years, interested users can farm MIR by contributing to liquidity pools for MIR and mAssets on Uniswap and Terraswap.      Since Mirror runs on Terra's blockchain, users will need to bridge with Ethereum to earn rewards there. ""Initially we are using a centralized bridge of our creation to bridge (called Shuttle) but we should be migrating to a more decentralized bridge called Wormhole early next year,"" Kwon told CoinDesk in an email.      MIR holders will earn a fee when users retire mAssets to reclaim underlying collateral; 1% of the collateral will be redistributed to MIR.      Holders of tokens with airdrop rights will need to visit the Mirror site to claim rewards. Institutional investors that want to farm MIR can do so through FalconX.

The move also prepares for the addition of a new distributed job marketplace on Intel’s open-source Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) for data labeling that better serves machine learning.      hCaptcha currently operates on 15% of the internet whereas Google’s reCAPTCHA dominates the majority.      “With reCAPTCHA, all that data, all that labeling and work flows within the company versus being an open ecosystem,” Human Protocol Head of Operations Lonnie Kurlander told CoinDesk in an interview.      “Look at Cloudflare to see why some customers chose to transition to hCaptcha,” she said, referring to the web-security company’s decision to leave Google’s system earlier this year for better privacy. Cloudflare also cited high costs on Google as a major reason for the move.      Human Protocol is currently live and active on a private Ethereum network, which Kurlander tells CoinDesk interacts with hundreds of millions of people. Each time anyone solves a hCaptcha on their computer, they are unknowingly interacting with the blockchain. A recent Outlier Ventures podcast dubbed it the most used dapp on the planet.      “The [Ethereum] mainnet simply could not support our customer requirements and the volume of transactions that already take place daily,” Kurlander said.      Coming to Polkadot allows the protocol to break jobs up into smaller tasks and decentralize the labor markets to anyone around the globe, Kurlander said. Moonbeam then becomes a key bridge between two layer 1 blockchains.      “Every base layer in crypto was going after this team,” a source familiar with the deal told CoinDesk.    Human CVAT    The initial infrastructure for the CVAT-based decentralized job marketplace will launch on Moonbase Alpha, the public testnet on Moonbeam, until the Polkadot parachain officially launches on mainnet in early 2021.      Similar to how freelance platform Upwork operates by posting jobs for freelancers anywhere to apply for, Human Protocol’s job interface is the platform and data-labelers are the freelancers with their own rates.      An example of a task would be to identify and label the bikes in an image, for hCaptcha or a similar application to later recognize that as an accurate image during its anti-bot process.      “It allows you to post a job spec, post the required accuracy and as long as someone qualifies they can scan the blockchain and complete the job to get paid,” Kurlander said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | MARKET,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/03/protocol-hosting-google-recaptcha-competitor-expands-to-polkadot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5499b7f6fb2a11d6c946a9b362e452e18d89d88-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433314,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4QZh,1607015100,Blockchain Bites: Bitcoin's Edge as a Hedge and Crypto's Reaction to the STABLE Act,"At stake    Destabilizing Act? Crypto Twitter, like the U.S. Congress, is largely divided between warring factions and in-groups. But for once it looks unified. All it took was a proposed bill to further regulate stablecoin issuers, the so-called STABLE Act.      The Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement (STABLE) Act would require stablecoin issuers – like Tether, Centre or Diem (formerly Libra) – to apply for federal banking charters, hold minimum Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reserves and register with the Federal Reserve. They would also be required to undergo ongoing analysis of any systemic risk.      In essence, the bill is applying a key component of banking regulation to the emergent stablecoin industry. Dollar-backed stablecoins are a small fraction of global financial activity, though it is a rapidly growing sector. As of October, there were some $20 billion in various programmable dollar analogues floating around the cryptoverse.      A number of high-profile crypto commenters immediately issued public comments lambasting the proposal, introduced by Rep. Rashida Tlaib and co-sponsored by Reps. Jesús “Chuy” García and Stephen Lynch.      Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the bill “would represent a huge step backwards” by limiting industry innovation.      “An enormous amount of the innovation brought to the underbanked and small businesses has been driven by non-bank fintech companies, and forcing crypto, fintech and blockchain companies into the enormous regulatory burdens of Federal Reserve and FDIC regulation and supervision is inconsistent with the goals of supporting innovation in the fair and inclusive delivery of payments that comes from stablecoins,” he said in a statement emailed to CoinDesk.      For their part, Tlaib, García and Lynch see the rules as leveling the playing field and could be a key part of creating an inclusive financial ecosystem. The idea is to prevent novel financial instruments from falling into the same exclusionary traps of the banking industry.      Tlaib explained the mission statement in a tweet: “Preventing cryptocurrency providers from repeating the crimes against low- and moderate-income residents of color traditional big banks have is critically important.”      Many in crypto think the proposed law would do just the opposite: By introducing burdensome compliance costs and reifying the power of traditional banks.      The bill overlooks “two core promises of decentralized networks: the chance to put more power in the hands of individual consumers and to catalyze innovation across payments and other financial services,” Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith said in a statement.      ""Cryptocurrencies LOWER the cost of servicing populations that have historically been excluded from the banking sector,"" Meltem Demirors, CoinShares' chief strategy officer, tweeted. ""Raising costs and compliance obligations forces companies to cut access for unprofitable clientele.""      Despite the pushback, it might be worth wrestling with some of the ideas in the document. The STABLE Act raises questions around what exactly a deposit is, what sorts of obligations issuers have towards their users and the novel regulatory challenges around an industry just getting started. That’s to say nothing of liquidity and credit risks.      “Any entity that wants to issue something that walks and talks like money or like a deposit should be regulated like a depository institution,” Rohan Grey, an assistant professor at the Willamette University College of Law (and an adviser for the bill), told CoinDesk.      To be sure, not all stablecoin issuers are the same – and many make promises about maintaining full, or partial reserves that are difficult to scrutinize.      “What is not clear, however, is whether the word “tethering” in the legislation’s name is a pun on the largest stablecoin, tether – or USDT – which is not otherwise mentioned in the congressmembers’ press release,” Modern Consensus Editor in Chief Leo Jakobson wrote.

The U.S. 10-year breakeven inflation rate, which represents how the market foresees long-term inflation, rose to its highest levels since May 2019 on Wednesday, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole reports. Growing fears of inflation typically drive both institutions and retail investors into store-of-value assets. Traditionally this has been gold, but this year, people are making their hedges with bitcoin. Bitcoin’s price has nearly doubled in the past eight weeks, and this may continue, as hedging demand for the cryptocurrency may now be set to rise further.    Top shelf    Dow's data S&P Dow Jones Indices will launch a customizable cryptocurrency indexing service in partnership with crypto tax service Lukka in 2021. In a press release announcing the product on Wednesday, Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, noted surging institutional interest for decent crypto pricing data. “With digital assets such as cryptocurrencies becoming a rapidly emerging asset class, the time is right for independent, reliable and user-friendly benchmarks,” he said.      Fee-less ETF Switzerland-based Valour has launched what it claims is the first bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) without management fees. Listed on the Stockholm-based Nordic Growth Market, the Bitcoin Zero ETP brings investors exposure to bitcoin in a similar way to exchange-traded funds and shares. The ETP structure is a type of security with a value derived from other investment vehicles – such as currencies, commodities or, in this case, bitcoin – to which it is benchmarked.      Staying or going? Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse appears to have walked back comments made about relocating his San Francisco-based payments firm. Six weeks ago, Garlinghouse floated the move, citing a lack of clarity about XRP’s legal status, the cryptocurrency at the heart of its payments operation, and a number of private investor lawsuits claiming said crypto is an unregistered security. Other countries, he said, had more favorable regulatory environments. Now he’s waiting to see what impact an in-coming Biden administration would mean for the startup. Ripple is reportedly eyeing an initial public offering.      Decentralized streaming Theta Labs is moving forward with its vision of democratizing content delivery with the beta release of its decentralized video streaming platform. Announced Thursday, the Theta Edgecast platform aims to reward its users while lowering cost of video content delivery by using a distributed network.

According to the announcement, the network currently consists of over 2,690 nodes worldwide.      Open development Kraken will fund open-source Ethereum development through Gitcoin.

42433304,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4QDh,1607014871,Valuing Open Source: Principles for Acquiring DeFi Projects,"As decentralized finance sees its first mergers and acquisitions, we’re left with a big question: How do you value an open-source project in a very new field like DeFi?      The whole thing is fascinating, almost a contradiction! An analysis of the issues can help us sharpen a toolkit for understanding value creation and power in a world of open source, programmable blockchains and their assets. It can help us understand why things like ""number of blockchain patents"" are nonsense, and therefore suggest to financial incumbents a better way to be.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is global fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    The last time we had a corporate development discussion about tokens was in 2018. Messari CEO Ryan Selkis noted that a number of low quality projects sold their ICO tokens and received ether. So let's say you sold 10 million of X, and got $10 million of USD equivalent denominated in ETH. As the market realized your project was worthless, let's say X falls 90% in value. But the treasury still holds $10 million denominated in ETH. So the vulture fund strategy, copying a page from the book of 1980s traders and leveraged buy-out professionals, would be to buy up all the worthless X and somehow get control of the treasury. You pay $1 million USD equivalent for $10 million in treasury assets and profit.      This didn't work for a few reasons. First, initial coin offering tokens did not have meaningful governance rights, or any enforcement mechanisms. If you buy them all, the only thing you hold is a bunch of digital pets. Yes, you could argue ""reliance"" to a court and extract damages or file injunctions. But it is highly unlikely that you would find suitable jurisdiction, and by the time you get it done, the house will have burned down. And second, ETH fell from over $1,000 to nearly $100. So the value of the honeypots became irrelevant.      Today, we no longer have ICOs, but we do have decentralized finance. And in the last six months, governance tokens over decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) have become the standard playbook.      Let's unpack that. If you buy a container that gives you economic rewards based on the efforts of others, you are very likely buying a security. If that security is sold to you in a way that is not pursuant to securities laws of your resident jurisdiction, there's a large liability on the issuer.      There have been some signs from regulators, however, that a token changes nature over the course of its lifecycle. It may add securities-like features, while starting out as an empty container. It may be at first motivated by usage (i.e., like a reward) and then become a participant in cash flow. The biggest lifeline came in 2018, when the Securities and Exchange Commission’s William Hinman introduced a concept of ""sufficient decentralization,"" per below. While far from gospel, many crypto entrepreneurs now believe that turning a protocol/project into a DAO gets the project over the safe line from securities registration. Time will tell whether relying on an SEC speech is valid defense.      It also helps that issuing governance tokens for a DAO creates market capitalizations and enterprise value for token holders. The main DeFi players of 2020 each have $100+ million or more in the market cap of their instantiated tokens. This has accrued from various distribution mechanisms that embedded financial assets as rewards for financial use. As an example, if you deposit your tokens for others to borrow in one venue you get rewards at some interest rate from the borrower.      See also: Lex Sokolin - The Smart Money Economy      According to Messari data, Uniswap and Aave are at $900 million, Yearn at $800 million, Maker at $560 million, Synthetix at $530 million, Compound at $470 million, Balancer at $100 million and Curve at $95 million. These numbers may change or go to zero. But currently, there is about $3.5 billion of enterprise value associated with the governance tokens of decentralized finance projects. Certainly there are many other projects, like Chainlink or Hegic or Ren, that are key to this space. But the above are the main DeFi machines in operation.      Now, $4.5 billion is a chunk of change. Envestnet is trading at $4 billion, Jack Henry at $12 billion, Temenos at $8 billion, Broadridge at $12 billion. These are your fintech industry comparisons.      When a large corporate tech player decides to buy up a competitor, the process is clear and well established. Generally, shareholders elect the board of directors, which governs the company and appoints executive management. Shareholders also vote for large, existential transactions that impact their stock holdings. The board applies business judgment to the corporate development path of the company, from issuing debt to buying back shares to investing in acquisitions. Within the company, executives focused on corporate development will hunt down targets and propose various transactions. Everyone knows what it means to maximize shareholder value, which largely boils down to maximizing EBITDA at some multiple in the market, without creating onerous debt.      But what about open-source financial protocols?    Decentralized M&A    Yearn is likely the most sophisticated financial DAO in existence. Whereas Compound and Aave match margin lend/borrow demand at particular interest rates, and Uniswap, Balancer and Curve create automated market making for on-chain trading, Yearn is a blockchain-native, fixed-income, active asset manager. For 2020 at least, Yearn is the Bill Gross of crypto, playing across trading fees, interest maximization, dividend farming, governance rewards and various other technological innovations that lead to capital appreciation.      The ""funds"" are called ""vaults"" or ""pools"" or ""jars"" and so on. They are just the equivalent of SMAs or fund interests, synthetically structured through code. The interesting thing is that the whole thing is open source, so in principle somebody could just copy the code base. And somebody did! The fork is called Pickle Finance and has between $100 and $400 million in assets. During DeFi’s summer run-up, forks generated trading returns by simply existing. However, over the long term, it is much more difficult to retain a community and assets. It is hard to maintain a thing that works in the highly adversarial DeFi environment, where protocols are under constant attack. A recent $20 million exploit left Pickle ... in a pickle.      The recent news is that Pickle is going to be merging with Yearn. Given that the technical architecture is quite similar, and the experience of the developers is comparable, the core part of the merger is onboarding Pickle developers to work on Yearn. This implies the Pickle protocol converges its path and community back to Yearn, and that Pickle-specific features will be an addition to, rather than a differentiator against, Yearn. Deeper DAO-related features will also be implemented based on a design from the Curve DAO. Holders can tweak the tokenomics of the machine in real time to create incentives in different dimensions (e.g., more issuance of rewards here, less here).    In a world where financial instruments are manufactured by machines on open-source rails, it is not the rails that are valuable.    This merger is not about the technology. It's about the people writing code to create the technology, and who pays them what. If the incentives from Yearn cash flows are much higher than the incentives from Pickle cash flows, a lagging protocol can't last long in an adversarial environment. Attackers prefer to go after those who have the least defense, not those who are most capitalized.      There is a fixed cost to defense, which creates competitive barriers and winner-take-all outcomes. And in a world where capital can move without friction between investment venues, a merger will also pull that community to follow you to the new protocol.      Notably, the governance tokens for Yearn had limited input on this ""transaction"" – in part because governance is not clearly, legally articulated, and in part because the transaction did not involve the sale and purchase of assets. The assets are open sourced, and people have the freedom and ability to switch what they decide to work on. Not only is capital movement much less restricted, but so is the stickiness of ""employees.""      Another announcement quickly followed. Yearn is merging with Cream, a fork of Compound and Balancer, making it a combination of lending markets and an automated market maker. In this case, however, it seems that Yearn is delegating to Cream several strategic product developments, like leverage and a pool-agnostic (i.e., collateral agnostic) stablecoin. In traditional finance, we would call this a cash sweep account. The developer teams, again, are merging together. We assume the benefit to Cream is in part driven the lower the costs of potential errors, in addition to higher cash flow.      And another: Yearn and Akropolis. The latter had a $2 million hack earlier in the month, and going forward will play the role of institutional distributor of Yearn products as well as be part of investment strategy formulation. The same compensatory mechanism of issuing tokens to Pickle holders (i.e., a piece of something that looks like debt) will be applied to Akropolis holders.

Yearn is extending not just its technology but its economics and reputation to ""bail out"" multiple projects that have great teams but have all suffered in the recent past.    Takeaways    In a world where financial instruments are manufactured by machines on open-source rails, it is not the rails that are valuable. Yes, over time the rails become more sophisticated and are stress-tested by capital and hacking. But what actually holds ""value"" are (1) the communities that commit assets to protocols, and choose to align economic activity with some particular brand and (2) the entrepreneurs that have the very rare skill-set of building and securing such protocols.      See also: Lex Sokolin - The Revolution You’ve Been Awaiting: Fintech + DeFi      The community is the business asset. It generates cash flow. It improves governance. It fixes hacks. Notably, communities align to brand narratives and the celebrities and influencers that spearhead the narrative. Andre Cronje will represent Yearn, despite decentralizing maximally his project, and is the face of the fund. Popular confidence in his goodwill and judgment is the measure of the project. Similarly, confidence in Vitalik Buterin is correlated with confidence in Ethereum. There is something deeply conservative in the realization that these futuristic finance networks rely on philosopher kings and have increasing returns to scale.      But this was always the case. Humans need torchbearers: Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and the rest. In the case of DeFi, the torch itself is of a different kind.

42433308,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4QPh,1607014509,"Swiss Wholesale CBDC Trial Shows 'Feasibility' for Central Bank Money on Distributed Ledger, BIS Says","An under-the-wraps Swiss trial testing how central bank money can be linked to financial markets built on distributed ledger technology (DLT) yielded positive results, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) announced Thursday.      Launched by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) in collaboration with BIS' Innovation Hub and Swiss stock exchange operator SIX, the project looked into the feasibility of using a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) to settle digital assets as well as link DLT platforms to existing payment systems.      According to the BIS report, the project has demonstrated feasibility for both approaches. Titled ""Project Helvetia,"" BIS said when using a CBDC limited to banks and financial institutions, a wholesale CBDC has potential advantages although it also raises some policy and governance challenges.      Read more: Bilateral Saudi, UAE Digital Currency Experiment Shows Benefits of Distributed Ledgers, Central Banks Say      On the flip side, while linking existing payment systems such as the SNB’s inter-bank payment network to digital asset platforms could avoid the hurdles raised by a CBDC, the findings noted it could also scale back the potential benefits of fully integrating distributed ledgers.      “Overall, having tokenized cash and assets on a single DLT platform simplifies the settlement of transactions and supports a broad variety of use cases. However, issuing a w-CBDC is likely to require significant changes to the processes and operations of a central bank,” according to the BIS report.      The report added that while integrating DLT into existing payment systems would be a relatively simple approach and would resemble the current system, it would also cut back on efficiencies raised by integrated tokenized central bank money and securities because it would function more like a link than a common base.      Noting that the experiment is no indication of the SNB’s intentions to issue a wholesale CBDC on SIX Digital Exchange’s (SDX) platform, the announcement said that different design choices to trade off some risks and benefits in issuing a CBDC would also need to be explored.      SDX had said in a March report it plans to launch its blockchain-based stock exchange at the end of this year. Project Helvetia, said the report, was the first wholesale CBDC experiment by the Swiss central bank and complements the planned launch of of the blockchain-based SDX.      “If DLT can deliver significant improvements in securities trading and settlement, then the SNB will be prepared,” Andréa M Maechler, member of the SNB’s governing board, said in the announcement.      Read more: Trump’s Security Hawks Call Distributed Ledgers ‘Critical’ in US-China Tech Arms Race      Because the wholesale CBDC model used for this test functions more like swapping cash for tokenized money, it would likely have limited monetary policy implications. But the report also noted this model could potentially “lead to some segmentation of the money market, which could negatively affect [its] efficiency and liquidity.”      The report said the next step would be to better understand the policy and fiscal implications of integrating wholesale CBDCs into core banking systems and explore their functionality across borders.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | WALLET,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/03/swiss-wholesale-cbdc-trial-shows-feasibility-for-central-bank-money-on-distributed-ledger-bis-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71783d390b1789d68a3e39a1b1e6da33b61fffc0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on all shipping-centric industries, drug sellers included. Criminologist Andréanne Bergeron estimates that only 21% of darknet market transactions resulted in on-time deliveries during the height of pandemic lockdowns in the spring.      But the virus only accounts for part of their pain. According to crypto tracing firm Chainalysis, darknet marketplaces are suffering their largest consolidation in at least five years.      Only 38 marketplaces for drugs and other illegal goods and services were operational in October 2020, Chainalysis found in a Thursday report. That’s a 37% decline from the industry’s February peak.      Between exit scams, denial-of-service attacks, falling order numbers and “temporary” storefront closures, there are now fewer online places to buy drugs with bitcoin than at any point since November 2017.      Chainalysis cautioned that surviving marketplaces are still making massive profits. With over $1.5 billion in revenue generated so far, darknet markets have already recorded a record-setting 2020.      Some darknet vendors tried to capitalize on this year’s uncertainty. In April, Elliptic, another blockchain intelligence firm, reported that “hundreds of listings” for discount N95 masks were popping up on darknet marketplaces.      Other vendors also veered more overtly nefarious. Elliptic spotted a handful of listings for controversial COVID-19 treatment chloroquine and other purported virus “cures.”      Virtually no one bought hand sanitizer, PPE or COVID-19 cures from these anonymous drug marketplaces, however. CipherTrace followed such postings for a month and found no notable sales.      Read more: US Government Darknet Drug Raids Seize $6.5M in Cash and Crypto      But the pandemic may well have boosted marketplace revenue by prompting customers to buy their stash bulk. Chainalysis said “uncertainty” could have led to casual buyers to “stock up.”      Chainalysis said the marketplaces’ biggest problem going forward maybe an apparently stagnating customer base.

42433305,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4QHh,1607007553,Aave Launches V2 in Bid to Make Borrowing Against Volatile Assets Less Risky,"For those still traumatized by March's Black Thursday crash, Aave is about to make long collateral positions a lot less risky.      The decentralized money market has rolled out its second version, with several features that should make it more flexible and more capital efficient. The most innovative feature, though, is its new collateral swap functionality, powered by a new and improved flash-loan system.      Users who use Aave to borrow against their crypto assets are effectively taking a long position. Decentralized finance (DeFi) got its start here. People who believed in ether but wanted to play in other markets could use MakerDAO to borrow DAI and use it to do whatever they wanted without selling their ETH. This was nice, but it kind of locked a user into that ETH position.      This new version of Aave lets a borrower change their underlying collateral in a very user-friendly, gas-efficient way without ever leaving Aave.      ""You could swap your collateral from LINK to AAVE, from ETH to YFI,"" Aave CEO Stani Kulechov explained over Zoom.      This is especially good if a long bet turned out to be a bad one.      ""Collateral swapping can be a useful tool to avoid liquidations,"" the company notes in a draft blog post about the updates. ""If the price of your collateral starts to fall, for example, you can simply trade it for a stablecoin so you don't have to worry about price fluctuations and potential liquidation.""      Read more: Aave Becomes Second DeFi Project to Overtake MakerDAO for Most Crypto Deposited      Of course, a user can swap collateral now but with some downsides: it would likely take several blocks that can lead to slippage, require using a couple applications and probably cost more gas. Aave's new collateral swaps take shortcuts, powered by flash loans, the Ethereum innovation in which a borrower opens and closes a loan within one Ethereum block.      That way, collateral is now liquid. ""You could practically trade it on a weekly basis or even a daily basis,"" Kulechov said.      Aave will also introduce additional nuance into its governance system and flash loans generally, while optimizing gas costs across the board.      ""Every time Tesla launches a new car, the batteries are better. Every time we launch a new protocol, it's more efficient,"" Kulechov said.    New lenders    Aave has other major updates in this new version but they will take a little more time to prove their worth, as they need other developers to build atop them.      Credit delegation is now native to Aave in version 2, but it will need other developers to come in and build new solutions to make it a real product (or many real products).      Read more: No Collateral Required: How Aave Brought Unsecured Borrowing to DeFi      When credit delegation was first rolled out, it was done in a high-touch, more centralized fashion, managed in-house by the Aave team. With this update, Aave's well-resourced users can now post collateral and distribute their borrowing power to others in the form of tokens.      A debt token makes it possible for one wallet to borrow against another wallet's collateral.      A collateral owner would be ill-advised to turn those tokens over to anyone else without some kind of assurance that the debt will be repaid, however. That's why other developers need to build systems that will provide that assurance and entice lenders to turn over their debt tokens.      ""It's basically a call to action for developers,"" Kulechov said. ""I think over the period of maybe 12 months this is going to create a lot of new products in DeFi.""    New money markets    Aave will also encourage other DeFi applications to copy it.      ""For us, the big picture is that it's scalable,"" Kulechov said. The more activity that happens over Aave, the better able the protocol is to pay for itself to adapt and grow with the times.      Aave proved that it's possible to create a public market for familiar crypto tokens to be deposited and borrowed against. Now it's going to enable other protocols to do the same with more unique tokens. For example, Uniswap and Balancer can create markets where liquidity provider (LP) tokens can be deposited in order to borrow other assets, such as stablecoins.

This year, it migrated its LEND tokens to the AAVE governance token. The governance token controls updates to the protocol and it also controls the Aave reserve, a fund built from a small portion of interest depositors earn on the money market.      With more money markets, Aave will drive more resources into its reserve, so the protocol can keep going over time.      ""Private markets are the most interesting,"" Jordan Gustave, Aave's COO, told CoinDesk. These would be permissioned markets that enabled loans against tokenized assets representing real-world, regulated assets, such as equities, cash flows or real estate.      ""With Aave v2 it will be much easier for anyone to create markets,"" he said.

42433312,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4QVh,1607006024,S&P Dow Jones Indices to Launch Crypto Indexes in 2021,"S&P Dow Jones Indices, a major financial data firm, said Thursday it will launch a customizable cryptocurrency indexing service in partnership with crypto data provider Lukka in 2021.      The coming product is poised to become a hub for cryptocurrency pricing data at a time when more Wall Street investors than ever are searching. This year's bull run is said to be driven by institutions angling for exposure to bitcoin.      ""We've been watching [the digital asset space] and we feel it's at a point of institutional interest in maturity, where companies such as ours wants to get in and contribute to the transparency of the marketplace,"" said Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices.      Surging investor interest ""reinforced the need for reliable pricing data,"" S&P DJI said in a press release.      Wall Street already had its share of crypto indices to choose from. Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index has provided quotes on highly liquid cryptos since 2018. Nasdaq, the tech-heavy exchange, has listed multiple crypto indices in the past few years.      Roffman declined to specify how the S&P/Lukka crypto indices would stack up against its competitors. But he said the partners' ""institutional quality"" will combine for a ""market leading offering.""      ""It's going to really employ best practices, both in terms of pricing the coins, selecting the coins, weighting them, you know, and all of the concomitant transparency that we bring to the marketplace,"" he said.      Lukka CEO Robert Materazzi said his company's ""Lukka Prime"" pricing methodology ""is part of our relationship with S&P.""      Reuters first reported the coming indices Thursday.      Although the product represents S&P's entrance into crypto indexing, a number of factors indicate the ratings conglomerate is positioning to capitalize on yet more of the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Parent company S&P Global has been hiring blockchain engineers for the past several months.      Also of note is S&P's planned acquisition of competitor IHS Markit for $44 billion. If the deal gets past anti-trust regulators, it would turn S&P into Wall Street's unquestioned data juggernaut.      It would also plug S&P into Lukka's tie-up with IHS Markit. In mid-November, Lukka agreed to offer crypto data to the Street via IHS. Executives from both firms were hesitant to outline the full scope of that offering at the time.      Raymond McConville, a spokesperson for S&P DJI, declined to comment on S&P Global’s announced merger with IHS Markit.

""So far, prices remain constrained, either with sellers unwilling to part with their coins at any lower price or buyers unwilling to take further bets on a rally,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the cryptocurrency-focused financial firm Diginex, wrote Thursday.      In traditional markets, European shares slid and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open after coronavirus-related fatalities in the country surged Wednesday to at least 2,760, the deadliest day since the pandemic began. Gold strengthened 0.4% to $1,838 an ounce.    Market moves    Those new to crypto, such as the institutional investors recently buying into bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative, might now be looking around for the next big thing.      With the long-anticipated arrival of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade on Dec. 1, that could be the network’s native token, ether. But analysts say ether should be judged on its own merits and not as a bitcoin replacement.      “I’ve always thought this digital asset space is huge – and it’s not just bitcoin – because there are going to be different applications for different things,” Raoul Pal, CEO and co-founder of financial media group Real Vision, said in Real Vision’s documentary “Ethereum – An Investigation,” which was released on Nov. 30. “I think of the two [bitcoin and ether] as having a very nice combined asset allocation.”      For Pal, an early bitcoin investor, the rationale seems even more plausible these days: As bitcoin’s price hits a new all-time high, the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now more expensive and thus potentially a riskier bet for new investors.      It can be expected investors are looking for a new opportunity in crypto at affordable prices. Given that ether is trading roughly 59% below its all-time high of $1,432.88, it is tempting to believe there’s a bargain to be had. What’s more, the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade to increase the network’s scalability, security and energy efficiency has generated a lot of hype.      However, at least for now, analysts and traders who spoke with CoinDesk don’t think ether will replace the FOMO over bitcoin.      “For institutional investors, they are buying BTC for the digital gold narrative,” Ryan Watkins, senior research analyst at Messari told CoinDesk. “ETH just isn’t in that conversation yet.”      - Muyao Shen      Read More: Why Ethereum and Bitcoin Are Very Different Investments    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin is locked in the range of $18,000 to $20,000 since Tuesday, having nearly doubled to a record price of $19,920 in the past eight weeks.      ""Large sell orders near $20,000 and consistent dip demand have led to price consolidation,"" according to Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG. “If either side breaks I believe we would see fireworks, especially to the upside.""      Macro factors point to a continued bull run. The U.S. 10-year breakeven inflation rate, which represents how the market foresees long-term inflation, rose to 1.85% on Wednesday. That’s the highest level since May 2019. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is seen near 91.00 at press time, a level last seen in April 2018, according to TradingView.      The USD drop and rising inflation expectations typically force both institutions and retail investors to buy traditional store-of-value assets such as gold. This year, institutions have increasingly poured money into bitcoin, reinforcing its use as an inflation hedge. The trend may well continue, with Morgan Stanley predicting another 10% decline in the dollar over the next 12 months.      A breakout, if confirmed, would shift the focus to $20,300, where sizable open interest appears to be building in the options market. Alternatively, acceptance under $18,000 would expose the Nov. 27 low of $16,218.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Worsening U.S. Dollar, Inflation Metrics Bode Well for Bitcoin's Continued Rally    Token watch    USD Coin (USDC): Visa may support a USDC credit card after adding Circle to ""fast track"" program.

42433286,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4M3h,1607000212,Bitcoin’s Price Is a Poor Proxy for Its Utility,"I have looked on with interest over the past two months as bitcoin has climbed to approach its previous all-time high. That old high-water mark occurred in the midst of hysteria. The price action of the time, three years ago, can only be described as mania. It was, to use the Gartner Hype Cycle language, the “Peak of Inflated Expectations.” In financial terms, it was a bubble.      This rally is different. This time has not been marked by a wild influx of speculative investors. We have not seen the long-tail of tokens pump to dizzying and inexplicable heights. Google Trends show searches for ""bitcoin"" have been hovering below 20% of the peak popularity the search achieved three years ago. This rally has been quiet, focused and therefore particularly striking in its magnitude. Have we reached the “Slope of Enlightenment” part of the cycle? Or perhaps the “Plateau of Productivity?”    Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.    There is a tendency among those of us who work in cryptocurrency to associate the Hype Cycle chart with bitcoin’s price graph. Gartner’s Hype Cycle, however, is not about price. It is about maturity and adoption of new products: whether and how emerging technologies are solving real problems. Just because the price is appreciating does not mean crypto is providing utility to people. And just because, this time, the price appreciation is not accompanied by hype does not mean it is founded on real substance.      With bitcoin’s silent, steady advancement towards $20,000, it is tempting to believe we have made it, that crypto is now the foregone conclusion that so many of us have expected it to be for years. It feels like, after years of seemingly Sisyphean toil, the industry is bringing its purpose to bear. But if we are to say that we have “made it,” we must first answer the question: where are we going? What is the goal?      “We are going to the moon!” echoes the refrain of bitcoiners. It is telling that the closest thing we can get to naming a common goal has only to do with price. Price, though, is not an end unto itself and speculation is not a use case.    Blind men    Beyond price appreciation the industry agrees on very little. Crypto has always reminded me of the parable of the blind men and the elephant. Several blind men come upon an elephant and as each touches a different part of the animal – the trunk, the legs, the tail, the side – he believes it to be something different – a hose, a tree, a rope, a wall. So it is with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.      These products promise something different to everyone who encounters them. To some, crypto is about scarcity: a form of digital gold. To others, crypto is about openness: the ability for anyone to build on and contribute to and use these products without permission. For others still, it’s censorship resistance. Privacy. Micropayments. Global, cross-border assets. All of us blind men are holding onto a separate feature of the technology and insisting it represents something different.    Crypto prices may be a little ahead of real use and adoption right now, but the industry is working towards rapidly catching up.    Until we have more agreement on what it is we have in front of us, it will be very difficult for the industry to have a common goal besides the moon. Will we agree that we have made it when bitcoin eclipses gold? Or when it becomes perfectly correlated with gold? When every remittance corridor runs on crypto rails? When every web app we use runs on decentralized infrastructure? Will we have made it when fiat money is eradicated? Or when central bank digital currencies have taken over? When the institutions come into bitcoin? Or when the institutions are defunct? With questions like these outstanding, it is little wonder that the only goal we can all agree on is that the price go higher.      While the price is appreciating right now, I do not believe we can credibly say that we have found our way up Gartner’s “Slope of Enlightenment.” Price is often a poor proxy for utility. Real use of cryptocurrency products and applications remains limited. Decentralized finance products have seen under 1 million unique users. Web3 technology remains in its infancy. Only about 2,500 merchants accept bitcoin in the United States. Adoption is trending the right direction, but it is still early.    Optimism    This may sound pessimistic, but I actually believe this is all cause for confidence. First, if we are all blind men clutching at an elephant, that is a strength of the space. It means that experimentation continues across a multitude of use cases. I believe the diverse nature of the work happening across the industry means we are more likely to get it right and discover the technology’s killer applications. And if what you are worried about is price, then I think you should also take heart here. If bitcoin can sustain these prices now, even in its state of relative immaturity, then consider the heights it may achieve when crypto actually finds full product-market fit.      See also: What Goldman Gets Wrong About Bitcoin (From Someone Who Used to Work There)      I am also optimistic about many of the products emerging that are focused on onboarding new users and driving actual participation and use as opposed to pure speculation. Companies like Fold and Lolli are doing this by using bitcoin as a reward for users. Products like Linen are pulling in mainstream users by offering them real utility in the form of high-interest dollar savings. Projects like RabbitHole are explicitly focused on teaching and incentivizing new users of protocols. Crypto prices may be a little ahead of real use and adoption right now, but the industry is working towards rapidly catching up.      Finally, there is one exception in all this. There is one area in which crypto adoption seems to have reached a reasonable level of maturity. I maintain that speculation is not a real use case. Holding, however, can offer utility. Bitcoin offers a hedge against inflation and uncertainty. This use case demands only a secure custody solution (and a viable regulatory and compliance framework). It is no wonder that this would become the first use of cryptocurrency to reach maturity. And it seems that this is happening. Corporates like Square and MicroStrategy buying up bitcoin are examples of this. Financiers like Paul Tudor Jones and long-time bull Abby Johnson are further proof points.      Bitcoin, as digital gold, leads the charge for crypto into widespread adoption. The other promises of cryptocurrency, meanwhile, have yet to mature and make their way into the mainstream. Prices will never be the best proxy, but they will remain in the spotlight.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/03/bitcoins-price-is-a-poor-proxy-for-its-utility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d459a6ae38ed4870c30b44c8ffdb39833f5ae07-1355x897.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hedging demand for the cryptocurrency may now be set to rise further, with expectations for long-term inflation reaching 19-month highs.      The U.S. 10-year breakeven inflation rate, which represents how the market foresees long-term inflation, rose to 1.85% on Wednesday. That's the highest level since May 2019. The metric bottomed out at 0.5% in March, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.      The money supply-boosting policies adopted by the Federal Reserve to counter the coronavirus-induced slowdown have done much to fuel the rise in inflation expectations, as well as the devaluation, or debasement, of the dollar.      The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, is seen near 91.00 at press time, a level last seen in April 2018, according to TradingView. The dollar peaked near 103.00 in March.      Such factors typically force both institutions and retail investors to buy traditional store-of-value assets such as gold. This year, institutions have increasingly poured money into bitcoin, strengthening its appeal as an inflation hedge.      ""What we're trying to do is preserve our treasury. The purchasing power of cash is debasing rapidly,"" Nasdaq-listed MicroStrategy's chief executive, Michael Saylor, told CoinDesk last month while explaining the rationale behind the company's decision to buy bitcoin. According to Saylor, bitcoin is a better store of value asset than gold.      Also read: Coinbase Brokered MicroStrategy’s $425M Bitcoin Purchase, Exchange Says      Several other firms have turned to bitcoin over the past few months.

Bitcoin's meteoric rally from the March low of $3,867 to Monday's record price of $19,920 has taken place alongside a steady downtrend in the U.S. dollar (above left).      The cryptocurrency has established a trading range of $18,000 to $20,000 in the past two days.

Listed on the Stockholm-based Nordic Growth Market, the Bitcoin Zero ETP brings investors exposure to bitcoin in a similar way to exchange-traded funds and shares, Valour said in an announcement.  While trading and owning the investment product will not incur management fees, the firm said it will incur ""investors' usual brokerage fees.""  The ETP structure is a type of security with a value derived from other investment vehicles – such as currencies, commodities or, in this case, bitcoin – to which it is benchmarked.  ""The launch of the Bitcoin Zero ETP ... marks a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of digital assets, enabling investors to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to bitcoin, whose value has almost tripled this year,"" said Johan Wattenström, Valour's founder and director.  Europe has seen a number of crypto ETP listings.

ClimateTrade's chief marketing officer, Ana Karen, told CoinDesk via email that Cabify selected her firm's platform as a way to compensate for the ride-sharing giant's carbon footprint.

The marketplace acts as an intermediary between those seeking to offset emissions and those wishing to invest in sustainability, according to ClimateTrade's website.      Users can directly offset their carbon footprint by selecting the most suitable credits from the projects offered and obtain the records of all their transactions in a private account.

42433287,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4Lzh,1606954279,Ripple CEO Walks Back Threat to Leave US,"The Takeaway    Ripple used to position itself as the regulator-friendly crypto firm.  Now the company is threatening to leave the U.S. over regulatory uncertainty.  Lack of clarity from the SEC about XRP’s legal status looks to be the sticking point.  The company is fighting several private investor lawsuits over the securities question and reportedly eyeing an initial public offering.    Ripple might not move out after all.      Six weeks after announcing he’s looking at potentially relocating Ripple’s headquarters because of the lack of regulatory clarity around the XRP cryptocurrency in the U.S., CEO Brad Garlinghouse is now taking a wait-and-see approach following the election of Joe Biden as U.S. president. Speaking to CNN's Julia Chatterley on Wednesday, he said the payments firm hadn't made any decision on the matter.      ""We haven't put a strict timeline on when we'll make a decision"" on relocating, he said. ""I think I am waiting to see what dynamics change, associated with the Biden administration beginning their term in office, and I am optimistic that will actually improve where things sit for the XRP community broadly.""      Garlinghouse donated to the Biden for President campaign earlier this year, according to Federal Election Commission records. Last year, he donated to the Kamala Harris for the People campaign when she was a presidential candidate. Harris later dropped out of that race but is now the vice president-elect and will take office with Biden.      Garlinghouse’s remarks diverge from previous comments, when he indicated the prolonged but fruitless efforts to get federal regulators on the firm’s side seem to have exhausted the patience of Ripple’s executives as the company eyes a potential initial public offering (IPO) and fights a lawsuit.    Change of tone  For years, the payments startup, closely associated with the XRP cryptocurrency, held itself up as an example of good behavior. In 2016, for example, Ripple was the second company in the blockchain industry to obtain the infamously stringent BitLicense from New York State (and later added the architect of that regime to its boardhttps://ripple.com/insights/ripple-welcomes-new-board-member-benjamin-lawsky/).    The firm’s CEO in those days, Chris Larsen, eschewed the then-fashionable term “disruptor” and stressed that unlike Bitcoin’s early adopters, Ripple aimed to assist, not usurp, regulated institutions. To do so it invested in multiple lobbying efforts in Washington.      Lately, the San Francisco-based company’s leaders have been notably less diplomatic. Current CEO Garlinghouse and Larsen, now executive chairman, have publicly threatened to move Ripple’s headquarters out of the U.S., citing the lack of regulatory clarity, particularly from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company recently announced it opened a regional office in Dubai.      Ripple is still a far cry from, say, Binance, the global cryptocurrency exchange that has hopped from one jurisdiction to another and has refused to even say where exactly it is headquartered. But the Silicon Valley unicorn’s open discussion of a possible relocation marks a strategic shift, underscoring how the sector’s compliance challenges have grown more complex over the last half-decade.      “Ripple wants to embrace regulation. And when regulation is clear and consistently applied it does result in a predictable outcome,” the company’s general counsel, Stu Alderoty, told CoinDesk in a recent phone interview.      This, however, hasn’t been the case in the U.S., he said.      “Other jurisdictions made pretty significant advances,” Alderoty said, denying that a relocation would be regulatory arbitrage, the corporate practice of taking advantage of differing regimes. In other jurisdictions, “there is a high degree of comfort that the regulator won’t say [XRP] is a security one day,” he explained.      The company’s reasons to consider moving out are “general frustration, and the maturity of other jurisdictions parading that regulation clarity,” he said, adding that for Ripple, “it would be irresponsible not to explore those opportunities.”      To be clear, Ripple hasn’t committed to moving out of the U.S. definitively. Its leadership may just be saber-rattling in hopes of motivating regulatory agencies like the SEC to take action. It’s not out of the realm of possibility that Ripple will stay headquartered in the U.S. even if the SEC continues its business as usual.      Alderoty indicated Ripple would remain compliant with U.S. regulations and likely continue doing business in the country. The specific benefits Ripple would gain by moving out remain unclear, as is why Ripple would move out of the U.S. now.      The SEC’s future focus is itself unclear. Current Chairman Jay Clayton intends to step down before President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January. Biden will get to nominate a new chair, shaping the agency’s course for the next several years.    Early years    Compared to the rebellious figures of the early Bitcoin community, Ripple, founded in 2012, looked like your straight-laced aunt.      “For Bitcoin, the goal was to create a decentralized currency and ledger, independent from any government or central operator. For Ripple, the goal was to create a decentralized ledger that could work with and improve the foundation of today’s payment systems,” Larsen said in a 2015 interview with fintech maven Chris Skinner.      During that era, the main category of regulation that preoccupied digital currency businesses was the kind designed to prevent money laundering, sanctions violations and terrorism financing.      As early as 2014, Ripple introduced a feature that allows financial institutions to stop certain transactions on its network (which is now known as the XRP Ledger).      XRP, the network’s native currency, could not be frozen, but dollars or euros issued by a bank on the ledger could, allowing Ripple’s corporate users (then referred to as “gateways”) to cooperate with law enforcement requests.      “The individual freeze is intended primarily for complying with regulatory requirements,” the company said in a notice at the time. “It also allows gateways to freeze individual account issuances in order to investigate suspicious activity. These features allow gateways to better operate in compliance of laws and regulations.”      Nevertheless, the following year Ripple was hit was one by of the industry’s first high-profile enforcement actions.      The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) fined the company $700,000 for failing in its early days to register as a money services business (MSB) and to implement an anti-money laundering program.      The company cooperated with FinCEN and agreed to make “certain enhancements” to the Ripple Protocol “to appropriately monitor all future transactions” and regular compliance audits.    Regulatory concerns    More recently, following the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017, an additional type of regulation has come into play for the crypto markets: securities laws. And this area has proven trickier to navigate for Ripple.      In 2018, a group of investors sued Ripple, alleging the company’s periodic sales of XRP were unregistered issuances of securities. The case is now in the U.S. District Court of Southern California. In October, Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton dismissed most of the plaintiffs’ claims but left three, on which the hearings will now proceed.      “The lawsuit is a symptom of the absence of [regulatory] clarity in the U.S.” Alderoty said.      In the meantime, the SEC was becoming more aggressive in pursuing companies that sold tokens through ICOs. The agency effectively won its lawsuits against Telegram and Kik; while both suits resulted in settlements, the terms were generally favorable toward the SEC, making both companies pay fines for unregistered securities sales and, in the case of Telegram, putting an end to the project.      To be clear, Ripple did not conduct an ICO, but founders David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britto “gifted” 80 billion XRP to the company, which then sold it to users. However, the climate for token-funded projects in general has been getting more and more threatening over the past two years in the U.S.      While Ripple has long insisted it did not create XRP, it is the largest holder of the cryptocurrency and has relied heavily on selling the asset. The company “would not be profitable or cash flow positive [without selling XRP],” Garlinghouse told the Financial Times in February. Ripple is also active on the buy side: the company is regularly purchasing XRP “to support healthy markets.”      ""Ripple generates revenue from multiple sources, but as a private company we don’t break out the details,” a Ripple spokesperson wrote to CoinDesk. “That said, Ripple does software enterprise sales – no different than Oracle or Salesforce. Ripple also has not sold XRP programmatically for over a year which is outlined in our quarterly markets reports.""      In previous years, Ripple sold XRP in two parallel ways: programmatically and over the counter (OTC). While the programmatic sales were paused in 2019, the OTC sales went on. According to the XRP Markets Reports published quarterly by Ripple, during 2020, the company has sold a little more than $70 million worth of XRP.      Hence, resolving XRP’s legal status is crucial for the company.      “Ripple put a lot of money in their regulatory work,” a source familiar with Ripple’s business told CoinDesk. “At the very minimum, they tried every means to push the SEC to issue the statement that XRP should not be regarded as a security.”      However, that did not happen, and seeing the SEC crack down on other token projects “it would be hard for Ripple not to worry about that,” the source said.      With XRP occupying an important place on Ripple’s balance sheet, if the SEC or a prolonged legal action ultimately deems the token a security, it might shake up the company’s entire business model.      Moving out of the U.S. won’t get Ripple out of the U.S. jurisdiction, Alderoty said, and the lawsuit would still proceed.      But relocation might spare Ripple some future struggles.    IPO hopes    The situation might get especially tricky as Ripple is reportedly mulling an initial public offering, said Gabriel Shapiro, partner at the law firm of Belcher, Smolen & Van Loo.      “They probably debated and/or probed the likelihood of getting a registration statement approved by the SEC,” Shapiro said. “But if it seemed like the SEC would leverage the registration process to give them a hard time about XRP or other aspects of their business, then they might have decided to try accessing the public capital markets abroad instead.”      According to Alderoty, there are no legal obstacles for Ripple to move its headquarters out of the U.S. while the investor case is ongoing.      “Moving out is not an effort to avoid the jurisdiction of the U.S. We are a global company, but we will always have jurisdiction of the U.S.,” Alderoty said.      He declined to say if Ripple has considered launching an IPO overseas.      Asked if Ripple has been talking to regulators in other countries to make sure they won’t give the company a hard time, Alderoty said that in places like the U.K., reading public guidance can be enough to understand the rules.      However, “not necessarily in connection to our decision to move our headquarters, we have always engaged with regulators all around the world,” he added.      Prior to Wednesday’s CNN interview, a Ripple spokesperson would not say why its executives were suddenly saying they'd pack up and leave.      ""Crypto regulation here in the U.S. is a guessing game – in part as evidenced by the recent [Department of Justice] report which cites eight different groups with regulatory oversight in the U.S. Some view crypto as a currency, some view crypto as a commodity, some view crypto as property and some view crypto as a security. We are not looking to avoid the rules. We just want to operate in a jurisdiction where the rules are clear,"" the spokesperson said.      The spokesperson declined to clarify what exactly the benefit of moving might be if Ripple were still subject to U.S. regulations, as Alderoty said it would be.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/03/ripple-ceo-walks-back-threat-to-leave-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26379ef17385f38ff89254ed8f012e8f571dc961-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
