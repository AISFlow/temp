42399050,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8SY,1464303426,Lawyers Be DAMNed: Andreas Antonopoulos Takes Aim at Arbitration With DAO Proposal,"Currently under review at The DAO, the distributed autonomous organization that has raised over $150m worth of the cryptocurrency ether to date, is a proposal for comment by one of the most recognizable people in bitcoin that would fund a project aimed at encoding a decades-old international legal structure into smart contracts.  Submitted by ""Mastering Bitcoin"" author Andreas Antonopoulos on 23rd May, the proposal entails a decentralized arbitration and mediation network, or DAMN, that would be built on top of the New York Convention legal structure.  Passed by the UN in 1958, the New York Convention is an agreement between more than 65 countries establishing that any decision made by a recognized arbitrator will not only be recognized by the courts of those nations, but enforced by them.  The resulting legal structure lets businesses and individuals alike resolve their problems in a legally enforceable way that, instead of being recognized in just one jurisdiction, is enforced across borders in some of the largest countries in the world, including the US.  If successful, DAMN would give its users access to a new form of dispute resolution that is not only more affordable, but almost borderless, according to Antonopoulos.  Antonopoulos told CoinDesk:  ""We’re going to create software that anyone can use and build on. We’re not going to be running DAMN. There’s not going to be one system than runs this. The important thing is the 'D', decentralized.""  According to the proposal submitted to The DAO for funding, DAMN will be a sort of ""opt-in justice system for commercial transactions"".  Through a network of smart contracts built on the public Ethereum blockchain, the benefits offered by the New York Convention and other alternative dispute resolution services will be made available more widely.  Still in its development phase, Antonopoulos and his co-creator, Pamela Morgan, CEO of Third Key Solutions, intend for the DAMN to provide users with layers of choices regarding whether a dispute will be resolved by a person, an algorithm, pools of random jurors, pools of experts, through collaboration of the parties involved or even another DAO specially set up for mediation.  Those who opt into the system will also be given a choice if the decision will be made public or not.  Cutting costs  Because the legal infrastructure set in place by the New York Convention is enforceable across borders in nations that also include China, the UK, Russia, Iran and Israel, the idea is that smart contracts that are compliant might also be enforceable.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Morgan, an attorney with a background in commercial arbitration, explained what she viewed as the true power behind the encoding of alternative dispute resolution services into the Ethereum blockchain.  Morgan said:  ""While this idea is relatively new to our community, these practices are well established in commercial transactions. This is not new. All we’re doing is bringing something that until now has been reserved for the elite, the well-connected, the wealthy, and we’re bringing it to every day people by way of smart contracts.""  According to the non-profit democracy research organization Public Citizen, the cost of initiating arbitration is ""almost always higher"" than the cost of a dispute resolution within a court controlled lawsuit.  In two examples provided on its website, the fee for a $60,000 claim was $221 compared to an arbitration fee of $10,925, an increase of 4,943%. Further, an $80,000 claim would cost $221, compared to $11,625 at an arbitrator, or a 5,260% difference.  In a statement published to The DAO Hub forum, Morgan writes that the proposal does not promise any return on investment to the DAO itself for the work. Instead, revenue will be generated through charging fees that undercut the traditional fee schedule published by the American Arbitration Association, which range from $750 for a filling fee and up to $65,000 for a claim fee of $10m or more.  Building with The DAO  Antonopoulos and Morgan break up the early phases of their work into two milestones, the first of which is a research report conducted over a three-month period during which they have applied to The DAO for a $30,000 investment, including fees for legal expert consulting, technical consulting and training expenses.  If they are successful, the second milestone will be the implementation of an actual dispute resolution contract, the details of which will be determined through the research period.  The Third Key team envisions its work as a series of rolling milestones that, once achieved, will be left online for others to build on.  The idea, according to Antonopoulos, is that every step they take will be incrementally deliverable to the open-source community, so that anyone can build other smart contracts that tap into alternative forms of dispute resolution.  Antonopoulos said:  ""There will not be one DAMN and we will not be running it. We’re building software, the software can be run to have hundreds and hundreds of dispute resolution systems of different levels of complexity catering to different needs run by anyone who wants to run them.""

42399034,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Bp,1464301454,CFTC Grants Full Registration to Bitcoin Swaps Trading Platform,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has granted formal registration to a trading platform that was an early entrant in the market for bitcoin financial derivatives.  TeraExchange, a swaps execution facility based in New Jersey, had been previously operating under a temporary registration order, and today's announcement formally recognizes this designation. The CFTC said it would regulate bitcoin as a commodity in September of last year.  The approval, one of three granted today according to a release from the agency, comes months after the CFTC simultaneously charged and settled with TeraExchange over alleged violations of the Commodity Exchange Act in 2014.  At the time, the agency said that a trade that took place in October of that year, and that was overseen by TeraExchange, constituted wash trading and pre-arranged trading. The firm settled without paying any financial penalties.  In addition to its bitcoin forwards contract – a type of derivative wherein one party agrees to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price from another party at a certain date – TeraExchange also runs a bitcoin price index.  TeraExchange’s approval comes shortly after another firm looking to offer derivatives trading in bitcoin, LedgerX, received temporary approval from the CFTC to operate last September.

42399039,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Gk,1464286717,Nasdaq Opens Blockchain Services to Global Exchange Partners,"Nasdaq has opened up its blockchain services to more than 100 of its market operator clients around the world as part of its newly unveiled Nasdaq Financial Framework.  Announced today, the framework is designed to provide end-to-end solutions to Nasdaq's financial infrastructure clients around the world including traditional exchanges.  The new financial infrastructure hub could pave the way for those exchanges and others to start using blockchain technology in a wide range of unnamed services.  Nasdaq’s executive vice president and head of market technology, Lars Ottersgård, said in a statement:  ""We have closely collaborated with our clients – including Nasdaq’s technology leaders who oversee our markets – to understand and anticipate what the future will require of market operators and how they can address both business challenges and opportunities ahead.""  The framework provides financial tools across three different areas, or ""core components"" as the statement describes the divisions, each designed so exchanges; inter-broker dealers; clearing houses; and central securities depositories can work with Nasdaq’s business applications in a single place.  The blockchain services are part of what Nasdaq calls its ""Core Services"" component, which also includes more traditional tools for operations and messaging. Nasdaq Core is ""the heart"" of the framework, serving as a hub, and Nasdaq Business Applications is a portfolio of business tools to support the full life-cycle of a trade, according to a statement.  Early-mover status  Going back to early 2015, Nasdaq has been one of the earliest Wall Street firms to publicly explore blockchain. In May of that year, the New York City-based exchange announced it was building Linq, a blockchain-based service to issue pre-IPO shares of companies.  By that December, Nasdaq issued its first investor shares on the platform, and this year, it made the announcement that it was developing voting technology for the Estonian stock market.  Since Nasdaq announced its plans, exchanges around the world have followed suit. Last month, CoinDesk published a report on 10 stock exchanges around the world now building with blockchain tech, including the Australian Securities Exchange, CME Group and Deutsche Börse.  Though Nasdaq's framework announced today leverage's the exchange's history, the program is a wholly new operation developed by its market technology’s division.  The suite of tools is available ""immediately"", according to the statement.

42399047,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Oc,1464283856,Santander UK to Launch Ripple-Powered Payments App in 2016,"The UK arm of Spanish banking group Santander has developed a new payments app in partnership with distributed ledger startup Ripple.  The app, announced today, is currently available to Santander UK staff, but the bank has plans to roll it out before the end of 2016, a move that would make it the first major bank in the country to offer payment services via blockchain to its clients.  The project is a product of the continued relationship between the bank and Ripple, an association that began in earnest when Santander InnoVentures, its venture capital arm, invested $4m as part of Ripple’s $32m Series A funding round last year.  Santander head of customer and innovation Sigga Sigurdardottir, positioned the app within the context of providing more digital services to its customers base.  Sigurdardottir said in a statement:  “The need for finance has evolved from providing a physical pound in your pocket or card in your purse, where you pay at a till, to being seamlessly integrated into a new, always on, connected lifestyle.”  Cross-border transfers  Users can send between £10 and £10,000 (roughly $15 to $15,000), enabling transfers into euros and dollars. The app makes use of the Apple Pay mobile payments app as an interface, leverages Ripple’s distributed ledger as the payment rail and settles those funds in accounts the following day.  The app currently allows transfers between Santander locations in 21 European countries as well as the US.  When a user sends a transaction through the app, it is broadcast across the Ripple distributed ledger. Funds paid out from one Santander account, after going through the one-day settlement phase, are then credited to another once settlement takes place.  In interview, Ripple global head of strategic accounts Marcus Treacher suggested that the app could be the first of several similar products developed in partnership with banks, and that in the long term, such a system could evolve into a direct, peer-to-peer payment app.  “In time, we want to be put in a position with our partner banks for end-to-end, person-to-person. There’s more to come,” he said.  2016 launch  Though the bank didn't give a firm launch date between now and the end of the year, representatives from Santander indicated that the launch could happen sometime in the fall or winter.  According to Santander UK spokesperson Andy Smith, the bank is aiming to release the app before the end of this year.  “We think it’s most likely this year, it’s not a 2017 thing,” he told CoinDesk.

42399046,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Nd,1464280096,"Blockchain Entrepreneurs, Musicians Test Ideas at Berlin Music Festival","A group of musicians, entrepreneurs and blockchain advocates is set to gather at a festival in Germany later this week with the aim of testing how the technology can change the music industry.  The Music Tech Fest Berlin is set to be held from 27th to 30th May. During this time, the MTFLabs: Blockchain initiative will bring together participants including Grammy Award winner Imogen Heap, who has been advocating for blockchain applications in the music industry since last year.  Also participating in the event are Vinay Gupta of Ethereum, music production platform PledgeMusic founder Benji Rogers and blockchain startups Ujo and Ascribe. About 25 participants total are set to take part.  Notably, attendees intend to write a policy report based on the event's findings and submit it to members of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.  In interview, organizer and moderator Peter Harris, who founded music streaming platform Resonate.is, said that participants are hoping the policy and strategy discussions set to take place at the event will form a springboard for meaningful applications of the technology.  Harris told CoinDesk:  ""While we do have a number of developers here, this isn't about writing code. It’s pointless to write a software app unless you’ve really done a thorough analysis of how it’s going to be used and who it’s going to impact.""  Focus on strategy  Specific areas of focus will include metadata storage, identity verification and establishing formal ownership of music for use by third parties.  “If you’re a film producer and you want to use a song, that process can be exhausting,” said Harris.  While Harris noted that there will be developers in attendance, the focus of the event is on how legacy members of the music industry, including music labels, collection agencies and publishers leverage tight control over information to increase their profits.  “I don’t think there is intentional evil being conducted in those organizations – there may be, but I don’t think so,” said Harris. “But the biggest issue is that there are silos of data.”  More work to follow  After the festival ends, multiple plans are in place to ensure the work continues.  In collaboration with Amsterdam-based Hack in the Box, the participants will collectively produce a whitepaper set to publish on 28th May.  The white paper will in turn lay the foundation for a report the event's director, Andrew Dubber, plans to submit to members of the European Commission.  ""We're going to tailor the white paper as a piece of policy and industry advice,"" Dubber told CoinDesk.  Then, on Monday, event participants including representatives of music streaming platform Soundcloud, the Berklee Institute of Creative Entrepreneurship (BerkleeICE) and others are invited to discuss the results with the European Alliance of Internet of Things Innovation (AIOTI), hosted by the conference and design firm, Funkhaus.  The event is intended to bring together the European policymakers and industry industry leaders including Samsung, Siemens, Bosch, Philips and Intel.  Harris concluded:  ""There’s a lot of interest here by the parties to keep this moving forward. We’re going to start with a white paper but there’s some concrete ideas too.""

42399052,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8TX,1464278107,21 Unveils Vision for Bitcoin-Powered Weather Data Market,"Bitcoin’s best-funded startup, 21 Inc, has unveiled a new proof-of-concept aimed at providing an illustration of how its bitcoin hardware and software can create new ways for data to be collected and monetized.  Called Sensor21, the prototype outlines specifically how a precision altimeter can work with a 21 Bitcoin Computer to create a miniaturized weather tracker capable of monitoring data points such as air pressure, altitude and temperature.  Using such a network, 21 contends that these devices can be made to query other cities to determine their data. Further, by gathering data from more than one location, users could collectively build a comprehensive weather map for a particular region.  The company explained:  ""With this short set of commands, you were able to turn a small sensor into a passive income stream. The value from the sensor comes from the fact that it is not locked up in a datacenter like a cloud computer, but out in the real world and part of a compute grid.""  The goal that 21 is moving toward is one whereby individuals are ultimately incentivized to share all sorts of data, whether it is the weather or radiation levels collected with a Geiger counter.  ""At the end of the day, a Geiger counter is just an electrical sensor. So capturing the data, managing it with a local database and setting it up for sale will be very similar for other sensors,"" 21 engineer Tyler Pate told CoinDesk.  The example comes in the midst of a more active period of announcements from 21 aimed at showcasing the work ongoing internally and its vision for bitcoin in the Internet of Things, or the goal of connecting all manner of non-computing devices to the Internet.  In March, 21 introduced a similar proof-of-concept called Ping21, which found the startup proposing how a grid computing network with micropayments incentives could help webmasters better monitor the status of global websites.  Further, at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2016 conference, 21 made its software package available for free, a development that means all computer users can now run software that was previously only available to users of the 21 Bitcoin Computer.  Expanded use cases  Still, 21 envisions how such a network could come to carry out beneficial societal functions, including helping rescue workers better respond during emergencies.  In the event of a meltdown at a nuclear power plant, such as what occurred at the Fukushima facility in Japan in 2011, a grid network would be able to efficiently collect information on levels of radiation, giving response workers up-to-date information about potential dangers.  This kind of tool could also be used to prevent future disasters as well.  Pate explained that one of the potential uses could have been in Flint, Michigan, and that such a network could have gathered water samples to determine quantities of lead. If there were multiple people collecting data on the water, these individuals could have sold it automatically, alerting groups and agencies that there was something wrong.  ""Watchdogs or other groups could query these sensors in a fast and efficient way,"" Pate said.  Jacob Donnelly contributed reporting.

42399035,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Co,1464273429,EU Parliament Approves Proposal for Digital Currency Task Force,"The European Parliament, the legislative branch of the European Union, has approved a proposal for a task force dedicated to digital currencies and blockchain technology.  A report drafted by European Parliament member (MEP) Jakob von Weizsäcker first began circulating in late February.  It called for measured exploration of the technology by the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, but stopped short of recommending more than closer monitoring. The report also urged EU leaders to address any risks related to money laundering and terrorism financing.  In the months since, the EU Parliament has held a number of events focused on bitcoin and blockchain. Versions of the report moved through the legislature in April, setting the stage for today’s vote.  The EU Parliament voted 542-51 to pass the proposal, with 11 MEPs abstaining.  After the vote, von Weizsäcker said that the primary function of the task force should be to “monitor” technology developments ahead of any concrete regulatory proposals.  Von Weizsäcker said in a statement:  ""To avoid stifling innovation, we favour precautionary monitoring rather than pre-emptive regulation. But IT innovations can spread very rapidly and become systemic. That's why we call on the Commission to establish a taskforce to actively monitor how the technology evolves and to make timely proposals for specific regulation if, and when, the need arises.”  From here, the report will be sent to the Commission for consideration, and presumably the formation of the task force will follow in the months ahead. In addition to its research mandate, the task force will likely propose a legislative for digital currencies and blockchain tech.  Given recent indications that the European Commission wants to expand oversight of bitcoin exchanges in the EU, it’s possible that task force proposals could mirror this policy direction.
