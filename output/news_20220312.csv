If bulls fail to flow back, prices could retrace from the $105 resistance level. Past Performance LUNA prices are pulling back from near all-time highs posted on March 11 when the coin rallied to retest $105. Terra is under pressure at spot rates, dropping roughly three percent on the last trading day. Technically, there is also a double tops pattern in relation to peaks posted in late December 2021. Based on the LUNAUSDT candlestick arrangement, there could be hints of weakness if bulls fail to reclaim $105. LUNA Technical Analysis Terra prices appear to be cooling off after a 140% expansion from early February 2022. The bear engulfing pattern of March 11 is from the $105 reaction level, signaling possible short-term contraction from the double tops. From this suggestion, risk-off LUNA sellers may dump on pullbacks towards $105, targeting this week&apos;s lows of around $77. Deeper retracements below the 20-day moving average could see Terra prices drop to December 2021 lows of $55. What to Expect of Terra?

Related Reading | Mars Protocol To Launch On Terra, But Why MARS Has Seen A Massive Dump At the time of writing, LUNA trades at $89.35 with a 4.8% loss in the last 24 hours. Despite recent losses, the cryptocurrency is quickly moving up the top 10 cryptos by market. Currently, it sits at the 7th position after pushing down Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polkadot (DOT). A report from economist Murray Rudd attempts to demonstrate a potential decoupling between Bitcoin (BTC) and Terra (LUNA). The number one cryptocurrency has a strong dominance over the entire market. Therefore, it is common for altcoins to trend lower of higher, to move in tandem, with BTC&apos;s price action. Recently, LUNA&apos;s price has possible start to breakaway from this pattern, it sometimes tends to move on its own direction regardless of Bitcoin. In order to support this thesis, Rudd examined the LUNA/BTC performance on different timeframes, and with different metrics. The economist represented this trading pair&apos;s performance with different correlation zones. As seen below, the green area represents a high correlation, while the red to white area represent periods when LUNA is uncorrelated (red) or shows a low correlation (white) with BTC.

42395807,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzTse,1647102907,Limiting Proof-of-Work Crypto Back on the Table as EU Parliament Prepares Virtual Currencies Vote,"The latest draft of the European Union's (EU) proposed legislative framework for governing virtual currencies, Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), still contains a provision that could limit the use of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.  Proof-of-work is the energy-intensive consensus mechanism that underlies popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). The computing process has come under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers in the EU over energy concerns.  A previous draft of the MiCA framework contained a strongly worded provision that proposed a prohibition of crypto services that rely on environmentally unsustainable consensus mechanisms starting in January 2025. But the provision was later scrapped following industry backlash.  The EU parliamentarian in charge of the MiCA legislative framework, Stefan Berger, said at the time that the paragraph in question had been removed, but that a final decision had not yet been made.  One version of the new draft, reviewed by CoinDesk, has a similar provision though significantly toned down from the original. It says that crypto assets ""shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union.""  If a proof-of-work consensus mechanism is operating on a small scale, it is exempt from having to meet sustainability standards, according to the provision. What qualifies as a small-scale operation has yet to be determined.  Read more: Crypto Advocates Push Back on Sweden’s Call for EU Mining Ban  It also says that energy-intensive crypto assets that are already in use in the EU before the legislation comes into effect, will have to ""set up and maintain a phased rollout plan to ensure compliance with such requirements"" as specified in another part of the framework.  Another version of the measure, also seen by CoinDesk, would soften the language even further. However, it's believed the stronger version has a lot of support among parliamentarians.  Although there are plans to move Ethereum from proof-of-work to a less energy-consuming consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake, it is unclear how bitcoin, the largest global cryptocurrency by volume traded, could transition from proof-of-work. So while there's been a huge push as of late to use renewable energy in bitcoin mining, the industry is still very much dependent on traditional energy sources, thus making the cryptocurrency potentially vulnerable under the stronger proposal.  The crypto community has been swift to react, with some calling on citizens in the EU to contact their parliamentarians to oppose the measure.  Ledger, a crypto hardware wallet provider, issued a statement saying:  Individuals and organizations should be free to choose the technology most appropriate to their needs. Policymakers should neither impose nor discriminate in favor of a particular technology. This is deeply concerning and would have serious consequences for Europe.  Pierre Person, a legislator in Paris and member of the Law Commission, condemned the newly added language in an extensive Twitter thread. In it, he addressed the impact that such regulation would have on European competitiveness in the growing crypto ecosystem.  The EU parliament is set to vote on the latest MiCA draft on March 14.

The trading volumes during this consolidation are low. https://www.tradingview.com/x/0TgpiPxX/ In addition, we should not forget that this consolidation is within the fall channel from November 2021. If buyers are not able to take control of at least $33 by the end of March - it is likely that the downward trend will continue with the final target of $17. The ideal scenario for buyers to start a new growth wave is to continue the current consolidation until May 2022.

In our previous analysis a month ago, we expected a gradual HBAR price fall to $0.2. For 4 weeks, sellers confidently implemented this scenario. During the trading week of 21 February, we see relatively increased trading volumes and a weekly candle with a small body. This fact indicates a struggle that sellers have largely lost. Please note that using higher trading volumes than during the weekly candle of 24 January, sellers were unable to update the local low. After the weekly closing of candles on 21 February, the initiative of sellers disappeared. https://www.tradingview.com/x/pGLZBd0X/ The $0.2 test without increasing trading volumes and volatility increases the chances of our main scenario - the formation of a new growth wave. The first growth target is $0.33, the final one is $0.45. To begin implementing this scenario, the HBAR price must first go beyond the wedge in which it will be traded from November 2021. If buyers can break through and keep the local mark of $0.2365, this will signal the beginning of a new growth wave in the HBAR market. An alternative cryptocurrency scenario for HBAR will take effect if buyers do not keep the $0.18 mark and are unable to keep above $0.2 when attempting a counterattack.

Shorting essentially means that you believe an NFT&apos;s value will drop, so you sell it to someone else before the value drops and then purchase it back after the value has dropped, at which point you hope to profit from the difference between what you sold it for and what you bought it back for. For example, if you borrow 1 NFT from your friend at $1 and then sell it to someone else for $2, you make a $1 profit no matter what happens to the value of NFT in the future. Unfortunately, most people don&apos;t think that the NFT market can be shorted because short sellers have no loans. But it turns out that this is not necessarily true… but does it even matter? Yes, You Can Short NFTs Shorting (Selling First, Buying Back Later) is a common trading strategy employed in traditional and non-traditional markets. By shorting a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), you could, in theory, speculate on undervalued tokens and receive double your returns if you&apos;re right. However, there are significant risks involved with shorting: For one, many NFT tokens are illiquid; it&apos;s hard to find buyers who want to buy out your position quickly and cheaply. Furthermore, if any individual or group of individuals owned enough volume of an illiquid token to manipulate its price against you, they could easily take more than 100% of your money...",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/is-shorting-the-nft-market-possible/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42411495,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSFj,1647046280,The First Crypto War May Lead to Lasting Peace,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine is the first crypto war. The digital asset front follows only the actual fighting in importance.  Crypto has been a major focus throughout events, including the Ukraine government’s requests for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the Ukraine DAO, both sides’ use of stablecoins as financial refuge, and European and U.S. bureaucrats’ angst over the use of cryptocurrency to bypass sanctions.  Paul H. Jossey is an adjunct fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and founder of the crowdfundinglawyers.com.  However the conflict ends, crypto will play a central role in world affairs. Moreover, the individual autonomy it brings could mean a more peaceful world, provided governments and global standard-setting bodies don’t kill this promise through overreaching regulation or forced public alternatives.  Crypto could give citizens of aggressor countries an informal “citizens veto” on war. If people flock to stablecoins amid host-country aggression or international sanctions, their actions could crush a nation’s ability to wage war. This veto is now happening as Russians ditch the ruble for stablecoins, and it may thwart Russia’s ability to finance hostile operations.  Preempting conflicts  The Russia invasion could augur a return to the more limited conflicts of the pre-World War I (WWI), gold standard era. As Columbia Professor Saifedean Ammous explains in The Bitcoin Standard, before WWI (also known as the Great War), gold standard countries were limited by popular sentiment (and their own treasuries) to wage war.  Read More: Ukraine Has Received Close to $100M in Crypto Donations  Once national reserves sunk, governments had to raise taxes or sell bonds to continue fighting. But in WWI, as the initially localized conflict spread, fiscal discipline failed. As Ammous explains, within the first month “all major belligerents had suspended gold convertibility, effectively going off the gold standard and putting their population on a fiat standard.”  By leaving the gold standard, countries printed money until, through inflation, the whole population’s wealth was squandered before winning or capitulating. This had devastating results. A “citizen’s veto” via people ditching a nation’s fiat currency would lessen or preempt conflicts altogether.  But governments could thwart this more peaceful future in two ways. The first option is forcing all crypto into a global Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. The second even worse option is to require everyone to use multi-jurisdictional central bank digital currencies (m-CBDC) with alternatives banned.  That AML/CFT is the primary concern of global and national financial regulators is no understatement. The United Nations estimates criminals and terrorists launder up to $2 trillion each year.  As CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter writes, stablecoins operate at least partially outside AML/CFT confines: “Stablecoin issuers treat the IOUs as bearer instruments, and generally do not seek to police user behavior when a transaction does not involve the issuer. ... By granting a measure of transactional privacy and not embedding political conditions into transactions, stablecoins are the closest thing to digital cash we have today.”  Some might say this may appeal to criminals, and perhaps initially it would. But it would be strange to think ne’er-do-wells would rely on traceable, public ledgers common to most cryptocurrencies as transaction facilitators.  The risks of permanent and public recordation far outweigh the benefit of removing cash’s physical limitations. Some have discovered as much the hard way, like the New York City couple allegedly sitting on billions but unable to spend them. Even the famous 2016 DAO hacker who almost brought down Ethereum and forced a hard fork has allegedly been unmasked.  The trade-off for privacy  Of course, criminals will create new ways to shield transactions that may temporarily succeed. But the public, through democratic means – not unelected central bankers and global financial bureaucrats – should decide how much of this monitoring they will tolerate in return for their privacy.  Further, as the Canadian Freedom Trucker Convey showed, those whom governments label terrorists expand with political expediency. (The Canadian government now admits the protests were not rife with money launderers and terrorists). Regardless, these actions should be unacceptable in a Western democracy.  Read More: Russians Looking to the UAE to Unload Billions in Crypto Assets: Report  An m-CBDC would be even worse. For example, the coming Chinese model forces every citizen to use the digital yuan, and every transaction is monitored, recorded and factored into people’s social-credit score. Western governments more sensitive to public relations would likely filter such scores through the softer veneer of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) metrics.  They could then deny transactions with companies deemed insufficient environment stewards or with inadequate corporate-board diversity etc. If this scenario sounds outlandish, terrorist designations for blue-collar protestors would have had a similar ring 12 months ago.  Neither of these models – granular AML/CFT or m-CBDC – allow for citizen vetoes in times of peace or war. As commentator Vivek Ramaswamy suggests, we may already be fighting a different war – the battle between the Great Reset imposed top down and the Great Uprising from the bottom up.  If so, crypto, with its promise of individual autonomy, control over one’s data and financial transactions, and potential to bypass entrenched institutions will be the main battlefield. If the latter wins, the first crypto war may bring a more peaceful world.
