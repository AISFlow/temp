A noteworthy premium has emerged in South Korea since last week after BTC has become approximately one thousand dollars ($1,000) expensive than any other place. There is about ten percent (10%) premium for ETH, swapping at around three hundred and twenty-five dollars ($325) in South Korea as compared to three hundred dollars ($300) internationally. This is even higher than Bitcoin, which is being offered at almost six and a half percent (6.4%) premium.

42382240,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r0wF,1561761007,Craig Wright Spars With Kleiman Lawyers in Combative Courtroom Appearance,"Craig Wright appeared in Federal court today to show cause why he had not certified facts pertaining to the list of bitcoin holdings he acquired prior to December 31, 2013.  The plaintiff, Ira Kleiman is suing on behalf of his late brother – David Kleiman's – estate. From 2009 to 2011, David Kleiman and Wright allegedly mined 1.1 million bitcoin together, which Wright entrusted to the Tulip Trust.  Ira is suing for half of the collective stockpile which Wright has alleged is inaccessible due to a complicated encryption scheme.  It should be noted the self-proclaimed bitcoin creator has already been found in violation of the court's order, according to the plaintiff’s representation on June 21. Today’s case was to determine the level of sanction due. It is still unknown whether Wright will be penalized at all.  Wright’s morning deposition was closed to the public, but the court was opened for the evidentiary hearing this afternoon. Reports of the trial have been coming through Twitter.  On the stand Wright again said Satoshi Nakamoto was a “character” he played when authoring and disseminating the Bitcoin Whitepaper, published over an email thread for cryptographic hobbyists in 2009.  Wright continued to say he is unfamiliar with what bitcoin has developed into and refused to recognize the concept of a “public address.”  “That idea is taken from Bitgold and Egold. Bitcoin is the opposite. Keys should not be reused for security,” he said, reported PJM on Twitter, refering to bitcoin predecessors.  The timetable for his involvement in bitcoin can be traced to his mining activity, which Wright asserted was suspended in August 2010 when his vision of a currency untainted by criminal enterprise was subverted.  “I created Bitcoin to be the FIRST digital cash system NOT connected to crime. The Silk Road was made for the sale of heroin, MDMA, Fentanyl, weapons then a reputation system was developed for assassination markets and for terrorism,” Wright said according to PJM.  Wright reportedly began to cry during this section of the hearing. He also “crawled into his lawyer’s arms after the testimony and bawled,” said thatcryptoguyyy, while discussing the case over twitter during a recess before Wright’s cross examination.  Wright’s emotional state allegedly carried into the cross-examination – lead by attorney Velvel Freedman of Boies Schiller Flexner – when he threw a print out of an email that Kleiman alleges Wright had forged to steal from the estate. Wright also accused the plaintiff’s counsel of misleading the court, though the exhibit was allegedly provided by Wright’s lawyers.  This is a pattern Wright is reported to have repeated throughout the hearing. When asked about the evidence pertaining to the Tulip Trust submitted to the court, Wright allegedly replied: “You have put forth documents I don’t recognize,” according to Carolina Bolado.  Freedman again responded that these were documents Wright’s counsel put forward in discovery, who also raised the question, ""A company you didn't buy until 2014 is listed as a beneficiary of a trust you claim to have created in 2012?""  He was referring to one of the companies Wright disclosed as a trustee in May.  As the cross examination continued, Wright also said he was unable to recall the key holders necessary to gain access to the Tulip Trust. ""I haven't looked at the file. No one asked me to look at the file,"" he said.  Freedman asserted that the court had ordered he produce the public addresses.  Earlier, Wright testified that he gave Dave Kleiman physical control of the keys that were doubly encrypted. He also arranged two separate chains – a spending and a holding chain – to follow all transactions involving the mined bitcoins.  Wright then said he instructed his business partner to hand over his keys to bonded couriers, who would not be able to deliver the keys until 2020.  ""So since 2016 you have known that you didn't have access to these files and wouldn't have access until 2020? And you knew this in February 2019, and March 2019?” Judge Bruce Reinhart asked.  On Wednesday, Wright filed an intention to call three witnesses to testify on his behalf, as well as to personally take the stand as a factual witness. It is unconfirmed whether these men – Kevin Madure, Brett Roberson, and Steve Shadders – have appeared in court.

42382239,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r11H,1561750805,Iranian Authorities Shut Down Two Crypto Mining Farms Amid Power Spike,"Authorities in Iran have seized roughly 1,000 bitcoin mining machines from two abandoned factories, according to RadioFreeEurope.  Following the June 27 action, a spokesman for the Energy Ministry said cryptocurrency mining operations were destabilizing the power grid and affecting electrical access for households and businesses. He warned that the government will continue to pursue mining operations, which have proliferated in recent years.  Electrical consumption in the country has spiked 7 percent, according to the minister, who also said the power used for mining one coin equaled the energy used by 24 residential units for an entire year.  Electricity is heavily subsidized in Iran, so the costs of running a crypto mining farm are cheap – as low as $0.006 per kilowatt-hour. Tehran-based crypto startup Areatak was previously reported to be hunting for foreign capital to establish crypto mining sites across Iran, though the practice is illegal.  Chinese firms, too, have set up facilities in Iran, bucking their home country's image as a crypto mining hub.  The Iranian government is considering setting a special price for the power used by crypto miners, proposed by the Energy Ministry. Though in his speech yesterday, the spokesman suggested that some crypto miners may be locating their power-hungry rigs in schools and mosques to avoid paying utility bills.  Safe haven?  A shrinking economy and the devaluation of the Iranian real have reportedly spurred citizens to seek sanctuary in cryptocurrencies.  ""Mining these currencies inside Iran will not only prevent money from leaving the country, it will also create currency under the difficult conditions of sanctions,"" Mohammad Shargi, head of Iran's Bitcoin Society, was quoted as saying by IRNA earlier this month.  He also suggested some Iranians could use cryptos as a means to bypass and subvert the strict sanctions imposed by the U.S., following its withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal last May.

42430684,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwrzh,1561737644,Golem Execs Depart to Pursue 'Riskier' Research With New Non-Profit,"Executives from multimillion-dollar startup Golem Factory are launching a new non-profit initiative called the Golem Foundation to pursue more ambitious research and development opportunities.  As stated in a June 28 blog post by Julian Zawistowski, CEO of the Golem Factory, the aim of the Foundation is to “strive for new – perhaps innovative and experimental, and at the same time riskier – approaches to the value proposition for Golem and for the Golem Network Token (GNT).”  Both Zawistowski and his counterpart Andrzej Regulski, who was COO of the company, will be resigning from their positions and handing over the reins to company CTO Piotr Janiuk and lead software engineer Aleksandra Skrzypczak.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Skrzypczak explained:  “After several years working together, we came to the realization that in order to keep the research and development of the Golem Network stable and focused, while not relegating the thirst that any technologist has for constant innovation, spinning off a new entity within Golem’s ecosystem is the best way to boost the efforts.""  All four of these individuals were early founders of the Golem Factory, which was established in 2016. At the time, the startup raised 820,000 ETH – around $240 million, according to current metrics – to build a distributed computation network atop the ethereum blockchain.  Often described as “Airbnb for computers,” the Golem project is essentially an alternative to current cloud computing networks where any user can buy or rent out unused computational resources.  Golem went live on ethereum mainnet early last year with a product beta release dubbed Brass Golem. Now the team at Golem Factory is looking ahead to the next beta release, Clay Golem, in the fall. Additionally, developers are also building ""Golem Unlimited"" which will support the creation of subnetworks on Golem run by data-center-like setups in order to expand network reach.  As the team at Golem Factory continues to pursue this technical roadmap for the Golem project, the Golem Foundation, headed by Zawistowski and Regulski, is expected to operate independently and pursue different team objectives.  “In the beginning, we want to start with thorough research of alternative approaches that contribute to the long-term vision behind Golem and create novel and out-of-the-box solutions useful for Golem and GNT,"" Zawistowski told CoinDesk. ""Exploring these options requires a limited period of time working in a semi-stealth mode.""  Pending announcements  For now, there are no firm details about the areas of focus for research and development from the Golem Foundation team.  However, Skrzypczak did affirm that ""privacy-related tools are an important part of Foundation plans,"" which will be shared with the broader community in due time.  Additionally, it remains to be seen what other individuals either from the Golem Factory or outside of the company will join Zawistowski and Regulski in pursuing more ambitious research and development strategies at the Foundation.  ""The new structure of the Golem Factory will be announced shortly – we are taking our time on this, because our core focus now is delivering our next [Golem] version with two new use-cases ... in the upcoming weeks,"" said Golem Factory's head of communications, María Paula Fernandez, in a message to CoinDesk.  However, in terms of funding for the Foundation, Zawistowski makes clear in his blog post that “the Foundation has been endowed with a portion of the original capital raised in Golem’s crowdfunding.”  To this, over $40 million in ETH and GNT were transferred Friday from the multi-signature account of the Golem Factory to the Foundation.  “From now on, our liabilities towards the community will be fulfilled in parallel by Golem Factory and Golem Foundation,” noted Zawistowski.

We’re going to have competitors.”  “I tell our people, don’t guess, you know they’re there, you know they’re coming, you know they want to eat our lunch. Assume it.”  Whether it’s a bank or a crypto service startup, Dimon said there are serious issues regarding the future of money. He believes some of these are caused by the government, specifically in determining whether they will be subject to banking regulations, KYC, the bank secrecy act, or anti-money laundering rules.  Sympathetic to the crypto industry’s desire to serve their clients, Dimon also said he’d “want to be able to serve their clients.”  “I always look at these [blockchain] systems like we’d like to do some of it too, ourselves.”  Jamie Dimon photo courtesy of flickr/Stefen Chow",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/28/jpmorgan-ceo-dimon-says-crypto-companies-want-to-eat-our-lunch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bb081716d96359c2bd5c34917bc368efc369a31-1500x942.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430685,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMws1h,1561726840,Blockchain Association Takes Over Kik's 'Defend Crypto' Crowdfunding Effort,"Canada-based social media company Kik is relinquishing control of its legal defense crowdfunding campaign to the Blockchain Association in an effort to broaden the initiative's reach.  Kik  and the Blockchain Association announced Friday that the D.C.-based lobbyist group would be taking over ""Defend Crypto,"" the crowdfunding initiative that Kik previously launched to raise funds for its ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  While Kik will retain the $5 million it initially contributed to the fund, all of the other donations – some $1.9 million – will be set aside for other crypto projects facing similar lawsuits. What's more, the company intends to donate $500,000 in kin tokens to help support the fund.  The move represents a significant departure from the effort's initial goal. According to the campaign's website, all donations were supposed to solely support Kik's legal efforts.  ""Once the case against Kik is resolved, all remaining funds, including any portion of the initial $5 [million] contribution by Kik, will be allocated to a nonprofit organization to be used for other initiatives that help with innovation in our industry,"" the website read as of June 24.  However, in its announcement on Friday, Kik wrote ""if we are going to Defend Crypto, we need to do it as a collective.""  The Blockchain Association was chosen to helm the initiative due to its advocacy work for the crypto industry, Kik spokesperson Tanner Philp told CoinDesk.  ""[The Blockchain Association] will be in the best position to objectively allocate the resources to the highest impact initiatives,"" he wrote in an email.  Kristin Smith, who currently heads the association, said in a statement that the initiative would continue to focus on legal battles for crypto startups, saying:  ""As stewards of the Defend Crypto fund, we will establish a structure to participate in legal proceedings that will have an outsize, positive impact on the entire crypto ecosystem.""  Smith added that ""regulatory clarity is sorely needed for companies and consumers in the crypto economy,"" possibly referencing Kik's argument that the SEC's complaint against the startup will add regulatory clarity for crypto projects.  ""We think we'll be able to leverage this fund to constructively engage with the courts,"" she said.  SEC vs Kik  Kik's legal battle with the SEC began last year, when the U.S. securities regulator told the company that it may have violated federal law when it conducted a token sale in 2017.  Kik disagreed with that assessment, and later took the unprecedented step of making both the initial Wells Notice – the SEC's argument on how Kik violated federal law – and its own response public.  Ted Livingston, the CEO of the company, told CoinDesk last month that it had already spent some $5 million going back and forth with the SEC since its initial Wells Response, but the regulator ultimately went forward with the lawsuit, filing a complaint against Kik earlier this month.  According to the complaint, Kik saw an initial coin offering as a last-minute effort to generate revenue, and promotional statements by Livingston during the sale supported the argument that the kin token is a security.  Attorneys told CoinDesk that the SEC case appears strong, though several warned that initial complaints are supposed to, and do not necessarily indicate the outcome of a case.  Kik has yet to formally respond to the complaint, though general counsel Eileen Lyon argued in a statement that the SEC's case is based on ""flawed legal theory,"" and Livingston's statements indicating that kin's price would rise was not a promise of profit.  Broader reach  The shift for Defend Crypto stems from the number of other projects that are facing their own legal cases, as per Friday's announcement.  Kik's crowdfunding push began a conversation about the SEC's efforts to police the ICO space, it said.  ""The SEC has been very effective in keeping everyone in different corners of the room, making it feel like their challenges with the SEC are unique to them, like they are going it alone,"" the announcement reads. ""We know how this feels – which is why we decided to make our Wells Notice and Wells Response public in January – we knew we couldn’t be the only ones. What we didn’t anticipate was just how many have been affected by the cloud of uncertainty.""  Philp told CoinDesk that a number of individual projects reached out to Kik privately, describing their own ""challenges with the SEC.""  Several of these projects may also need financial or legal support, he said, declining to name any examples.  ""They have asked to remain confidential for now, which is part of the overarching challenge,"" he said, adding:  ""Everyone is scared to come out publicly for fear of what that might mean for their project going forward, but the only way we can make progress is if we work together. Our hope is that this fund will give projects the resources and confidence to be part of the discussion.""  For now, Smith said, the immediate goal for the initiative is to ""establish a structure and governance policies.""  Kik's announcement anticipates that there are ""many more"" cases to come, though not every project will be well-funded. Companies that do not have the resources to fight the SEC in court ""have no choice but to fold,"" which would be ""setting a dangerous precedent for the industry and killing innovation.""  Supporting the initiative are Messari, Arrington Capital and ShapeShift. These companies ""have taken an active role"" in helping guide the fund, and were part of the shift in Defend Crypto's mission, according to the announcement.

42430701,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwsFh,1561719600,Bitcoin Heading for Fifth Month of Gains Despite Price Correction,"View  Bitcoin is still on track to close with gains for the fifth straight month, despite having witnessed a double-digit technical correction in the last 36 hours.  The hourly chart shows the pullback has ended and prices could revisit recent highs over the weekend.  With a reward halving due in May 2020 and increased institutional participation, prices could rise further in the second half of this year.  A break below the May 30 high of $9,097 would invalidate the bullish outlook as per the daily chart.      While bitcoin’s price has witnessed a double-digit correction in the last 36 hours, the cryptocurrency is still on track to end in the green for the fifth consecutive month.  The price of a single bitcoin fell to $10,300 on Bitstamp yesterday, retracing 55 percent of the rally from the June 4 low of $7,432 to the June 26 high of $13,880.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,800, down 15 percent from recent highs. However, despite the correction, the top cryptocurrency is still up 38 percent from its June 1 opening price of $8,546.  With the monthly close just two days away and technical studies reporting bullish conditions, BTC is likely to end June on a positive note.  The resulting five-month winning run will be the longest since August 2017, as seen in the chart below.  Monthly chart  The stellar run could be extended in the second half of this year, as the cryptocurrency is set to undergo a mining reward halving sometime in May 2020.  Further, some observers including Anthony Popliano, co-founder and partner of Morgan Creek Digital, believe the rally seen in the first half was backed by institutional money and the inflows may rise further in the future, thus keeping BTC better bid.  Meanwhile, Marc Bhargava of tagomi.com, the first electronic prime brokerage in cryptocurrency markets, believes this year's rally is the product of both retail and institutional money.  While talking to CoinDeskLIVE, Bhargava said the 2017 rally was almost entirely driven by retail money, while the one seen this year has been more balanced, with an approximately 80:20 ratio of retail to institutional money.  Bhargava, however, cited low trading volumes as a cause for concern and stressed the need for increased adoption by large asset managers for further price gains.  That said, there seems to be a consensus in the market that Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency will end up boosting bitcoin’s appeal as an anti-establishment asset and thus its adoption rate.  All-in-all, the macros seem aligned in favor of the continuation of the price rise in the second half of this year. The long-term technical charts are also flashing bullish signals.  Meanwhile, the intraday charts indicate the pullback has ended and recent highs could come into play over the weekend.  Hourly and daily charts  The hourly chart (above left) shows that the relative strength index (RSI) has breached the descending trendline, invalidating the bearish divergence (lower-highs pattern) established earlier this week.  Further, the chart is reporting a bearish channel breakout. As a result, BTC could rise back to levels above $13,000 over the weekend.  Supporting the bullish case is that the cryptocurrency repeatedly bounced from the bullish (ascending) 10-day moving average on the daily chart (above right).  The outlook on that time frame will remain bullish as long as the price is held above the May 30 high of $9,097.  Weekly and monthly charts  Prices may come under pressure next month as the weekly RSI (above left) is reporting extreme overbought conditions, with the highest reading since January 2018.  Any price dip, however, will likely be short-lived, as a channel breakout and a bullish crossover of the 5- and 10-month MAs on the monthly chart (above right) may to have opened the doors for a rally to record highs above $20,000.

Finance Magnates says it spoke to Binance at the FinTech Junction event in Israel on Thursday, with the exchange's CSO, Gin Chao, saying that early discussions have taken place with Facebook over a possible future listing of the libra token.  Chao said that as libra will be on a private blockchain initially, it won't need external liquidity. However, Facebook may ultimately desire a secondary market, he said, adding:  ""Currencies benefit from a secondary market, so it would be in their best interest to want to be listed.”  In another report from industry blog CryptoPotato, which also spoke to Chao at the Tel Aviv event, he further suggested that Binance may support the Libra blockchain by acting as a permissioned node that validates transactions.  Facebook has said that it will eventually have 100 nodes and has already named firms like Visa, Uber, eBay and Lyft as having already committed to the role (at the princely sum of roughly $10 million apiece).  Chao said that Binance is ""definitely considering"" the option, although a final decision is yet to be made.  Speaking generally about the Libra project, which was unveiled in mid-June, he said:  “It’s a good thing, for sure. Any time a company with the weight, size, resources, and impact of Facebook gets involved, it validates both blockchain and [cryptocurrencies].

Forbes said Thursday that the Bitsane exchange, which offers spot trading of cryptos and gained popularity as an early provider of XRP trading, has gone offline and has deleted its social media accounts. Emails sent by Forbes bounced back, it said.  Customers of the exchange are saying that they have possibly lost amounts ranging from $5,000 to $150,000 in crypto holdings.  On crypto data website CoinMarketCap, Bitsane's trading information has not been updated for over 10 days.  A user that claimed to have lost $150,000 and requested to remain anonymous told Forbes:  “I was trying to transfer XRP out to bitcoin or cash or anything, and it kept saying ‘temporarily disabled.’ I knew right away there was some kind of problem. I went back in to try to look at those tickets to see if they were still pending, and you could no longer access Bitsane.”  Launched in 2016, Bitsane was registered in Ireland as Bitsane LP, with Aidas Rupsys listed as CEO and Dmitry Prudnikov as CTO. Forbes says Prudnikov’s LinkedIn account has now also been deleted, and that both could not be reached for comment.  Some users apparently suspect that another firm, Bitsane Limited, which was founded by Maksim Zmitrovich, may be connected to the possible exit scam.

TaTaTu’s initial coin offering (ICO)  was among the biggest of 2018, with film producer Andrea Iervolino raising money from royals like Lady Monika Bacardi, of the famous liquor family. Before this raise, Iervolino was best known for films such as “Bernie The Dolphin” and “Finding Steve McQueen.”  As some token sales start to slowly yield results, TaTaTu offers a prime example of a platform that used ""blockchain"" as a fundraising technique and then largely moved on.  The TaTaTu project, originally meant to offer a publicly traded cryptocurrency associated with a media streaming platform similar to Netflix, once attracted investment from Ari Paul’s BlockTower Capital (which declined to comment for this article) and movie stars like Johnny Depp (whose representatives did not respond to requests for comment).  Despite being entirely run by a band of remote freelancers hired by tech-newcomer Iervolino, the project was one of the top-five largest token sales of 2018, behind EOS ($4 billion) and Telegram ($1.7 billion).  But now Iervolino says crypto was never really the point.  When asked if TaTaTu is a blockchain business, he was clear:  “Not at all. We have one blockchain component in our system.”  However, that hasn’t stopped users from trying to trade the company’s ethereum-based TTU token on public platforms like YoBit.Net. Plus, one former employee, who goes by the online alias Legendster, told CoinDesk his task was “generating buzz” by creating announcements, airdrop threads, and bounty campaigns where “basically anyone and everyone is welcome.”  Regardless of whether the sale directly involved retail users or only accredited investors, an analysis conducted with Alethio's reporting tool on CoinDesk’s behalf showed TTU token activity has remained low since August 2018, with 70 percent of all transactions occurring on July 31 and August 1, 2018, just a few weeks after the sale’s completion in June.  Iervolino told CoinDesk this is because, despite what the TaTaTu white paper originally listed, this token sale was mostly done through private investments. He declined to name any individual participants, adding the company has since transferred that value to a platform-based points system without a public blockchain like ethereum. (This is why Alethio’s analysis was unable to detect significant activity since last year.)  “It's a young project in the startup phase. A lot of projections and idealistic things were mentioned in the white paper but have not been delivered,” one anonymous former employee told CoinDesk. “It's hard to predict the future regarding what [Iervolino’s] plans are.”  Indeed, a common sentiment among former employees referred to Iervolino as the sole driver and overseer of this operation. More recently, the pivot away from ethereum inspired early contributors to distance themselves from the project.  Another former TaTaTu cofounder, who asked to stay anonymous to protect his professional relationships, told CoinDesk:  “Whoever invested in TaTaTu in the beginning did it thinking that they would be buying a token that can work on a decentralized platform and could be traded. … I think that [Iervolino] is not behaving fairly to the people that invested in TaTaTu.”  Career boost  Around the same time as the sale, Iervolino, a relatively unknown producer, was seen yachting with Selena Gomez. Months later he reportedly inked a deal to produce a film for the TaTaTu platform – a Lamborghini biopic starring Antonio Banderas and Alec Baldwin.  “We finished the shooting of the first section of the [Lamborghini] movie,” Iervolino said. (IMDB currently lists the film in post-production.)  One anonymous source with knowledge of the company’s operations told CoinDesk that reserves are spent in “bizarre” ways, including potential token deals with Hollywood A-listers. Iervolino confirmed Banderas received tokens as part of the “Lamborghini” production deal.  Although TaTaTu critics now describe the token sale as merely opportunistic, Iervolino prefers to see the startup as creating a “circular economy” that rewards users with tokens for watching films, plus fashion shows and sporting events. These tokens can also be used toward coupons, he said, with various e-commerce and retail partners such as the Italian luggage manufacturer Carpisa.  Plus, he added, Italian users can now access an e-commerce site where “some test products” are available for purchase with TTU.  Almost a year later, Iervolino declined to say how many users the live platform has attracted so far. The site offers films like 2006’s “Snakes on a Train” and 2012’s “Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies.”  Meanwhile, Iervolino is also a contributing producer on what is arguably his most mainstream film to date, “Waiting for the Barbarians” starring Johnny Depp, which is currently in post-production. Regardless of TaTaTu’s traction, it’s clear the token sale elevated Iervolino’s status in Hollywood.  Describing his future plans for the media startup, which has dramatically diverged from the original white paper in the past 12 months, he added:  “It’s a streaming platform, mixed with social media, that shares the value with the users.”  Spotlight image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/28/a-wannabe-netflix-raised-575-million-on-ethereum-then-ditched-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9f523f704120a4346d285da6032ee11ee4a6a83-2486x1466.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430691,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwsDh,1561685442,Down $1.7K: Bitcoin's Price Dives Amid Crypto Market Boost,"Bitcoin is down more than $1,700 since yesterday after a violent sell-off that rocked the markets and caught even seasoned traders off-guard.  At 16:00 UTC on June 27, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bitcoin (BTC), suffered a steep correction in its price, dropping to a low of $10,300 after eight straight days in the green.  Prices attempted a rally above $11,300 with 30 minutes out from the daily close, which would have provided greater confidence in price consolidation for the bulls. Yet, instead, BTC closed on a down note below former resistance at $11,086.  BTC is currently changing hands at $11,067 and is down 14 percent over a 24-hour period.  As can be viewed above, BTC suffered a massive correction to the parabolic uptrend that had been ongoing for over two weeks. The move down was accompanied by a large surge in trading volume, with June 27’s daily total matching, if not, besting June 26’s postings across most exchanges.  For example, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, Binance, recorded $2.1 billion in total volume alone, while Huobi Global and OKEx recorded $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion over a 24-hour period, respectively.  Further, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined suffered a $46.1 billion loss over the last 24-hours, marking the biggest single day loss in market value since May 17, 2019.  The total market cap is down from $372.4 billion to stand at $324.5 billion at press time while the total amount for BTC’s loss in value by trades end amounted to just over $33 billion.  Altcoins on the rise  Perhaps the greater story, howecer, is the altcoin market’s rise against BTC pairings, which has driven up their value while BTC continued to decline in price.  All but two out of the top 20 are in the green today, up between 1.3 and 15.72 percent and are demonstrating a small bounce across the lower timeframes.  The idea that traders have switched from BTC to altcoins in the short-term is supported by a change in the BTC dominance rate, down 1.41 percent over 24-hours, from 63.37 percent to 61.96 percent. This suggests traders are currently moving to tether (USDT) or major altcoins to conserve some profit from BTC’s violent drop.  The short-term remains highly volatile, so BTC could experience a brief bounce on today’s price action, but that will need to be accompanied by similar levels in volume in order to end the recent sell-off.
