42378847,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mF19,1475427693,Bitcoin Provisions in the North Carolina Money Transmitter Act,"Todd Bryant is the president and founder of Bryant Surety Bonds. He is a surety bonds expert with years of experience in helping business owners get bonded and start their business.  Here, Bryant provides an overview of new cryptocurrency provisions recently added to the Money Transmitter Act in North Carolina, and spells out what they will mean for bitcoin businesses operating in the state.  The North Carolina Money Transmitter Act was recently extended to cover bitcoin traders with House Bill 289, signed in July 2016 by State Governor Pat McCrory. Deemed as the ‘virtual currency law’ in the state, the bill introduces a legal framework for regulating bitcoin and blockchain technology.  While the legislation had to go through an elaborate and long discussion period, including the feedback of various stakeholders, the bill is seen today as business-friendly by many. It brings legal clarity in the field of virtual currencies in North Carolina, but does not open venues for over-regulation.  The Chamber of Digital Commerce and other involved parties contributed to the formulation of this addition to the act. They have also expressed satisfaction with the outcome.  Bitcoin regulations  The now extended Money Transmitter Act includes a definition of virtual currency, which reads:  “A digital representation of value that can be digitally traded and functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value but only to the extent defined as stored value under G.S. 53-208.42(19), but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the United States Government.”  Naturally, this definition has been the first step towards regulating the virtual currency field in North Carolina.  According to the act, bitcoin traders will fall in the category of money transmitters and as such, they will have to obtain a license. There are a number of exempt options such as being the agent of a payee, but they need to be duly demonstrated.  A license will not be needed from virtual currency miners, as well as blockchain software companies for a number of services such as smart contract platforms, smart property, multi-signature software and non-custodial and non-hosted wallets.  As commented by bitcoin advocates, the legislation is seen as matching the needs of the newly emerging industry. It distinguishes between businesses using virtual currency versus those using distributed ledgers. Additionally, the law clarifies which types of activities trigger the licensing requirement for blockchain technology companies.  The licensing process  The licensing application process is also defined in the act. Money transmitters will have to follow the procedure set via the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and will be licensed by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks.  The most important documents that need to be presented during the licensing include business entity paperwork, active money business services registration with the United States Department of Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, business plan, anti-money laundering program documents, and audited financial statements, among others.  The minimum net worth for licensing is set at $250,000 and it should be kept at all times. The application fee is $1,500. There is also an annual assessment fee of $5,000 for transmission volumes below $1 million. Above that amount, the assessment fee is calculated as a percentage of the transferred volume on top of the basic annual assessment fee of $5,000.  Bond requirements  One of the new elements introduced with this addition to the act is the money transmitter bond licensing requirement for bitcoin traders. This special type of surety bond is needed in order to bring up the level of security in the business. The function of the bond is to guarantee that bitcoin traders will handle their clients’ virtual currency assets according to the applicable laws.  The bond amount that traders need to post depends on the volume of money transmissions per year. The standard bond requirement is $150,000 for money transmission volumes below $1,000,000. For volumes between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000, the bonding requirement is set at $175,000.  The next level is set at $200,000 for traders with an yearly volume between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 per year. For volumes between $10,000,000 and $50,000,000, the bond needs to be $225,000. Finally, if the transmission volume is above $50,000,000, the bond requirement is $250,000.  In order to get bonded, virtual currency traders will have to apply for a money transmitter bond with a surety provider. After examination of their financial profile, the surety sets a bond premium, which is a percentage of the required bonding amount. Stronger finances and solid business stats are key to lower bond costs for money transmitters.  Accepted rather positively by both businesses and legislators, the bitcoin addition to the Money Transmitter Act is bound to bring the necessary level of regulation to virtual currencies and blockchain technology in North Carolina.

42378853,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mF7R,1475421498,Could Rising Interest Rates Threaten Bitcoin Prices?,"It could be said that bitcoin was born in an era of low interest rates.  The world's first decentralized digital currency was first mined and traded in 2009, at a time when central banks were using unprecedented stimulus in an effort to keep borrowing costs minimal. Following the financial crisis, these institutions cut their benchmark rates close to zero and engaged in asset-purchase programs in an effort to meet this objective.  Interest rates dropped sharply because of these efforts, and as a response, investors began reassessing available opportunities considering the low-yield environment.  What did this mean for bitcoin? For one, investors found the digital currency more compelling since the opportunity cost of foregoing interest-rate payments was lower.  In this low-rate environment, one could argue that investors saw bitcoin as having similar incentives to other safe haven assets, for example bonds. As long as the interest payments provided by these safe assets were modest, investors had little reason to seek them out over bitcoin.  However, should borrowing costs push higher, the digital currency could lose some of its luster. If interest rates start rising, it could draw many investors away from bitcoin and into interest-bearing assets like bonds.  While the global economy has enjoyed a drawn-out period of low interest rates, this situation might change soon, several experts told CoinDesk.  Since bitcoin doesn't provide investors with interest payments, rising interest rates could make the digital currency less appealing to market participants. Bitcoin's supply changes only very gradually, and therefore any reduction in demand could prove bearish for prices.  Rising rates a surprise  Any such change in the interest-rate environment would come as a surprise to many, said Robert Johnson, president and CEO of The American College of Financial Services.  Borrowing costs have fallen to record lows after enjoying a steady, downward trend since the early 1980s, stated Johnson.  Interest rates hit all-time highs in the early 1980s, a consequence of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's efforts to bring down the high inflation that began during the previous decade. During the 1970s, the price of a barrel of oil surged in value, which resulted in the US economy suffering both high inflation and stagnant economic growth.  Fed policymakers realized that the central bank would not be able to fight both inflation and economic weakness at the same time, and opted to reign in inflation. They did so by hiking the Fed's benchmark mark rate up to unprecedented levels.  Amid these efforts, the yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasuries both hit all-time highs in September 1981, reaching 15.84% and 15.20%, respectively.  Since hitting this peak, interest rates have been following a downward trend.  Monetary policy  The current environment of low interest rates could experience significant shifts if monetary policy becomes less liberal.  If the Fed hikes the benchmark federal funds rate at its December meeting, this move would place upward pressure on broader borrowing costs.  Such a rate hike is something Johnson believes is in the cards.  ""I believe that the Fed will begin raising the benchmark federal funds interest rate following the US presidential election in November,"" he told CoinDesk. ""This will initiate a series of rate hikes that will lead to higher rates throughout the economy.""  Scott Tucker, a Chicago-based fiduciary investment adviser, also pointed to the key role played by the election, stating that by waiting until after this event to hike rates, the Fed could avoid appearing politically motivated.  The central bank is eager to increase benchmark rates after keeping them low for so long, he said.  Low inflation  However, there are certainly factors that could hold back such a rate increase, noted Tucker.  Any such developments could prove bullish for bitcoin, or at least help stem downward pressure on the digital currency's price.  For starters, inflationary pressures have been modest. During the 12 months through August 2016, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers rose 1.1%, well below the Fed’s target rate of 2%.  In addition to lackluster inflation, concerns about European economies, as well as those of Japan and China, could hinder any Fed desires to hike benchmark rates, Tucker argued. While there are concerns about economic strength abroad, many are also worried about US economy's tepid recovery.  ""The Fed has limited scope to raise interest rates while US economic growth remains moderate and other major economies show anemic growth,"" Brett Whysel, a financial expert who teaches Public Economics and Decision Making at City College of New York, told CoinDesk.  Whysel emphasized that raising US interest rates could prove counterproductive by boosting the dollar, which would in turn reduce exports and hinder the broader economy.  Any potential impact on the greenback could be amplified by the fact that both the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and other central banks in that particular region have been harnessing negative interest rate policies.  This approach helps devalue their currencies, which makes their exports less expensive relative to those of other nations such as the US.  In spite of all these reasons the Fed might have for keeping rates unchanged at its December meeting, Whysel gave a 50-50 chance the central bank would hike its benchmark rates at the event.  Gradual rate hikes  Even if Fed policymakers opt to hike the benchmark rate at the December policy meeting, the central bank's officials have repeatedly assured market participants that any upward climb in rates will be gradual to avoid jolting the economy.  In addition, central banks that are using ultra-low interest rate policies and negative interest rate policies may be a long ways off from entertaining rate hikes. Once they do begin the process of raising rates, it may take several increases before market participants feel motivated to purchase fixed-income securities.  Should bitcoin price in steady rate increases, the digital currency may do so rather gradually, giving traders time to respond to any such development.  But, there are many other factors that could affect bitcoin prices aside from central bank policy and its impact on broader interest rates.  While low inflation could make the Fed reluctant to raise rates and therefore reduce the odds of bitcoin prices encountering a potential headwind, high inflation could easily prompt market participants to flock to the digital currency as a safe haven.  Bitcoin could enjoy continued draw as a safe haven should economies like Europe and Japan continue to suffer economic weakness.  However, if these regions enjoy notable improvements in their business conditions and their central banks decide upon rate hikes, these two could provide bitcoin prices with combined headwinds.  But, thus far, bitcoin has had more than seven years to gain adoption, overcome its challenges and rise in price.  Though certain concerns remain unresolved (for example, the question of how to address the digital currency's block capacity dilemma), its chances of surviving any threats associated with rising interest rates are likely high as the currency has had close to a decade to establish itself.
