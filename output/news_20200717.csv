Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $9,174 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.64% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,054-9,184  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving average, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Read More: Exchanges See Drop in Volumes as Bitcoin Volatility Approaches 2020 Low      Traders are optimistic that bitcoin’s weak market, with low volumes and low volatility, can quickly change. Price movement outside of the low $9,000s territory is key, said Rupert Douglas, head of business development and institutional sales at London brokerage Koine. “This tussle between bulls and bears from $9,000 to $9,500 is a slow grind at the moment. A close outside these boundaries will likely see a sharp move either way.”      It will take more exciting news than a Twitter hack attempting to scam social media users out of bitcoin to bring the world’s oldest cryptocurrency out of stagnation, said Jean-Baptiste Pavageau, a partner at Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha.      Read More: Why Bitcoin Traders Couldn’t Give a Sat About the Twitter Hack      “The fact that bitcoin didn’t move because of the Twitter scam shows the importance of $9,100-$9,200 range to either consolidate the trend and move higher or invalidate the level and fall toward $8,200,” said Pavageau.      In a sleepy bitcoin sector, several analysts pointed to the crypto derivatives market as a sign the industry is still growing. “In general, the markets have come a long way and I am particularly excited about some of the new derivatives platforms that have emerged.” Mick Sherman, founder of New York-based Trading Firm Altcoin Advisors.      In particular, CME, Binance and ByBit have seen growth in open interest.      In addition, U.S. dollar-denominated open interest on Seychelles-based derivatives exchange BitMEX is around $700 million, a high not seen since the excitement surrounding May 12’s bitcoin halving, a scheduled reduction in the cryptocurrency’s new supply output that happens roughly every four years.      Read More: Bitcoin Halving 2020 Explained      “We still see a lot of interest and building momentum for derivatives and expect this to continue for some time, particularly as traditional managers seem less interested in holding the underlying but still want exposure to price movement,” said Douglas Bilyk, business development director at crypto brokerage Copper.      Derivatives might be a factor, but cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin could weigh on the market as well, Bilyk added. “We're expecting a large bitcoin move but direction is unclear. One ‘canary in the coal mine’ might be the bullish moves in some of the blockchain development tokens these past few weeks.”    Ethereum transactions highest since 2018    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Friday, trading around $233 and climbing 0.33% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).

On Monday, total transactions reached 1,151,834, the first time it has been that high since Jan. 18, 2018, according to data from aggregator Etherscan.      With decentralized exchanges now around $60 million in volume per day, tokens on the Ethereum network, often referred to as altcoins, are giving traders new ideas to profit within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. “I don’t see bitcoin as a clear trading opportunity right now, however there are some opportunities with altcoins that have performed really well lately.” said Alessandro Andreotti, an Italy-based bitcoin over-the-counter trader.

First place will net a $10,000 payout.  Developers will get a goal (build a chance-based game), a deadline (nine days), a suggestion (make it decentralized web-friendly) and not much else, said John Paller, who runs ETHDenver. “We've intentionally not put huge rails on this,” he said. “We didn't want to stifle creativity.”  Paller said that premiering winners’ games on decentralized infrastructure (an Ethereum-based game, say) is “on the table.” But he cautioned that “full Web 3.0 would be a Phase 2 thing” that depends on winners’ tech specs and ongoing discussions with the state.  Colorado is betting this jam will yield novel lottery products with broad gamer appeal, said Meghan Dougherty, communications director for the Colorado Lottery. “The lottery is really looking to grow into a billion-dollar organization by 2023, so we’re really trying to reimagine our game offerings,” she told CoinDesk.  More lottery revenue equals more funding for state parks and schools - $13.7 million went to Colorado Parks and Wildlife last fiscal year.

42404864,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlEvt,1595008910,"Twitter Hacker Is Mixing Bitcoin Loot Using a Wasabi Wallet, Elliptic Says","Funds collected by the scam that breached Twitter this week appear to be on the move, cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic said.      According to transaction data associated with crypto wallets used in the security breach, a total of about $123,000 was collected by the attackers. Of that about 22%, 2.89 BTC, was transferred late last night to an address Elliptic said it “strongly believe[s]” is a Wasabi wallet.    Wasabi wallets allow users to circumvent the transparency guaranteed by bitcoin’s public blockchain by mixing up the transaction trail, thus making it harder for law enforcement to follow the money.  According to Elliptic, the firm is able to identify Wasabi wallets based on distinctive transaction patterns. While exchanges can usually identify their clients using KYC checks, which makes it possible to flag fraudsters for law enforcement, the use of a Wasabi wallet makes it harder to pin down where a client’s money came from.  In a recent statement, Twitter said Wednesday’s security breach had targeted over 130 users, allowing attackers to gain control of user accounts and post identical messages demanding bitcoin. The firm also said it was investigating whether the attackers had accessed any non-public data on the platform.  Responding to claims about the hacker’s use of a Wasabi wallet to mix the loot, zkSNACKs, the firm that makes the wallet said in an emailed statement, “Although it is sad that there are dishonest people using our product, the truth is that for every 1 person utilizing our CoinJoin service for malevolent purposes, there's another 100 people utilizing it for the right reasons.”    UPDATE (July 20, 17:24 UTC): This article has been updated to include comment from the developers of Wasabi wallet.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/17/twitter-hacker-is-mixing-bitcoin-loot-using-a-wasabi-wallet-elliptic-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b35c4bfe0dab84c80cb0a385b798948536563361-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404869,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlF0o,1595007060,Money Reimagined: This Isn't Good for Bitcoin,"No, blockchain does not fix this.      By “this” I don’t mean centrally controlled databases that are vulnerable to attack, the problem highlighted by this week’s massive Twitter hack.      I mean the meta problem of yet more bad publicity, with the word “bitcoin” again associated with fraud and unsavory behavior, a picture that cryptocurrency advocates will again struggle to avoid. That problem will indirectly but greatly contribute to ongoing public pressure for regulatory constraint on the cryptocurrency industry, which will impede innovation in the sector and its prospects to bring positive change to a broken financial system.      A related problem is that Crypto Twitter is an echo chamber. It is too smart for its own good. Within that nerdy hive mind, form doesn’t matter. It’s all about substance.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      “Bitcoin isn’t a crime, it’s just code.”      “The hack will open eyes to the failings of a centralized system.”      “Decentralization is now inevitable.”      Oh, how I wish those sentiments, expressed repeatedly over Twitter this week, were absorbed by “normies.” Sadly, it won’t be the case.      In two consecutive tweets, Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali laid out the challenge between what should be and what, sadly, will be.      Might the spectacular breach of Twitter’s defenses eventually convince people to abandon the centralized internet platforms that control their data? Maybe. But many in the mainstream will share the views of New York Magazine’s Josh Barro, who argued, poorly, that the hack wouldn’t have happened if we banned cryptocurrencies.      Barro is a smart, influential columnist, respected on both sides of the political divide. It’s counterproductive to call him a would-be Communist “moron,” as this Crypto Twitter member did, alongside many others’ derogatory comments. It signals more about the critic than the criticism, helping perpetuate negative stereotypes of the crypto community.      A far better response came from Ideo CoLab’s Ian Lee, who highlighted Barro’s error in conflating technology with a crime.      But in the age of social media, constructive nuance like that gets lost in the noise of ad hominem attacks and invective.      That’s a problem because Twitter is a powerful factor in public debate. The performance of the conversation – the form, as much as the substance – matters for how public opinion develops.      And that matters because public opinion feeds into regulation, which in turn can impede innovation.    DeFi in the crosshairs?    This comes amid signs U.S. regulators are focusing on some of the more innovative crypto financial engineering projects.      On Monday, news broke that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission had forced two separate settlements, worth $150,000 each, out of Abra Global, the crypto-based provider of synthetic digital asset products.      Abra, which counts American Express and Indian billionaire Ratan Tata among its investors, has long been seen as one of the most innovative companies in the crypto industry. It launched in 2014 with what was then a radical idea for a crypto-collateralized synthetic stablecoin enabling peer-to-peer remittances from the U.S. to the Philippines. (Abra wasn’t providing an actual token to users, but a contract giving them rights to a fixed-dollar value worth of underlying bitcoin, a deal it achieved via some sophisticated hedging techniques and by using the intermediary-free Bitcoin blockchain as the settlement layer.)      More recently, Abra took the same synthetic assets model to offer non-custodial derivative-like investment exposure to a range of assets, including both crypto tokens and traditional financial instruments. In effect, it allowed anyone in the world to place bets of any size on the direction of U.S. stocks and bonds.      That’s what got Abra into trouble. The SEC determined it was offering “security-based swaps,” which precluded it from selling to U.S. customers not classified as accredited investors. Although Abra took steps to geofence the American market from its product, the regulators found it hadn’t done enough.      The fines won’t derail Abra, which has a growing global base of customers. But the action underscores the challenges for crypto companies doing innovative things in the U.S. against what continues to be a somewhat hostile posture from the SEC. (The CFTC has generally taken a more accommodating stance toward cryptocurrency innovation. Its former chairman, Christopher Giancarlo, is now driving the charge for the U.S. government to embrace a tokenized version of a digital dollar.)      In particular, there are risks for the Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, movement. Abra is not formally a DeFi provider, but its model – using underlying cryptocurrencies as collateral to assure stability and blockchains for an intermediary-free, low-friction settlement rail – shares similarities with this burgeoning industry.      There’s no reason to suggest DeFi leaders like MakerDAO and Compound are in breach of securities, derivatives or money transmission laws. But you can bet that Washington regulators now have their eyes on an industry that’s bringing services such as collateralized lending and interest rate benchmarking – traditionally the domain of highly regulated financial institutions – into a decentralized setting.      The DeFi industry was perhaps too small to matter to regulators before this. But, although the $2.6 billion in value now locked in DeFi contracts is still just a fraction of the trillions in traditional lending markets, it’s now big enough to get on regulators’ radars.    'Collateral' damage    This is why the Twitter fallout matters. If “cryptocurrency” continues to be a dirty word in Washington, political pressure will come to bear on the agencies seeking to regulate the industry.      DeFi is not immune from all that.      To be sure, the industry could benefit from more smart regulation. Legal clarity and reliable protection from scammers could help expand DeFi adoption and drive progress from a speculative ecosystem to one that generates valuable credit products and risk management tools.      But if the regulatory backlash is too blunt, it could do great harm to innovation. DeFi development can and will continue offshore. But as Abra’s experience shows, the global digital economy’s borderless nature makes it hard for companies to comply with regulations everywhere even when they want to. So the regulatory risk will continue to dangle over the heads of innovators.      That’s a pity, because while participants face real risks in the freewheeling, unregulated world of DeFi, the ideas generated there offer an exciting reimagining of the financial system. Whether it ends up looking anything like the current Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem or something else, the prospect of reducing gatekeeper friction in finance is appealing in a world where exclusion from credit often defines the difference between rich and poor.      DeFi leaders have lawyered up in a bid to stay compliant. Some of the issues they face were discussed in a DeFi regulation workshop CoinDesk hosted during our virtual Consensus: Distributed event in May. There, Ropes & Grey attorney Marta Belcher eloquently argued that regulators may even be in breach of developers’ First Amendment constitutional rights if they constrain efforts to writing open-source code for decentralized communities.      But do not underestimate the power of Washington or the extent to which social media-infused hysteria can energize those who wield that power.      This is why the messaging around events like this Twitter attack matters. At times like this, crypto thought leaders should all try to take the high road.

A history lesson    A common theme here at Money Reimagined is the current financial system tends to serve those with access to financial assets while creating barriers for those on the lower rungs of society. This is a particularly important issue for assessing the impact of the Federal Reserve’s massive quantitative easing program in response to the COVID-19 crisis. I continue to believe the real risks from that program, at least for now, lie far more with asset price inflation, and its accompanying impact on income inequality, than with inflation. Global demand for dollars is just too big and the economic fallout from the pandemic too great for any monetary oversupply to unleash an accelerated increase in consumer prices.      So, it was quite impactful for me this week to discover the annotated historical charts on equality presented in a colorfully named site I’d never encountered before: WTFHappenedin1971. The reference to 1971 is, of course, the so-called “Nixon Shock,” the moment when the U.S. took the dollar off its peg to gold, abandoning the core anchor of the Bretton Woods global financial system established in 1944. It was also when the world’s central banks suddenly gained fiat monetary powers, an unimpeded capacity to create money, the very powers the Fed is now drawing on to fight the COVID-19 recession.      The classic hard money, anti-1971 argument is that central banks degrade people’s wealth by inflating the monetary base, though strong arguments are made on the other side that fiat monetary creation power enables them to better manage economic cycles, and that a contained amount of inflation is necessary to achieve that. That debate hasn’t been resolved for centuries and may never be. Perhaps it’s less controversial to talk about the unequal distribution of that monetary policy’s impact. This chart from WTFHappenedin1971 shows the effect on income equality since those monetary powers were given to central banks half a century ago.      Notably, the chart is from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank typically described as “progressive” and that earns a “Left” rating on the spectrum provided by AllSides.com. It’s not the only one from a left-leaning organization that’s included in The WTFHappenedin1971 site. Another from the Economic Policy Institute shows a striking divergence between productivity expansion and the relative stagnation of real wages since 1971.      In other words, a site that’s implicitly making the typically conservative argument for a return to the gold standard or to bitcoin-like hard money principles is cleverly drawing on the observations of the left to make its point. The American left typically favors government activism via money and fiscal policy to attack poverty, not strict constraints on monetary issuance.      Libertarians argue, with some validity, the left simply doesn’t see how fiat money inflation hurts the poor by eating into their buying power. But the left says that’s offset by the benefits of higher income from jobs created via monetary stimulus and easier credit.      Where might these positions align around this clear inequality divide? Around something that I see as a bigger reason to embrace decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies than the strict scarcity function of bitcoin’s monetary policy: the excessive power of financial intermediaries. Inequality has gone hand in hand with the financialization of the American economy, where finance and financial groups have held increasing sway over the economy. That trend accelerated dramatically in the post-1971 era because of the political and economic clout that Wall Street earned for itself as the de facto agents of monetary and financial regulatory policy. Disintermediating that is where the real opportunities lie for crypto.    Global town hall    CHIMERICA. Before there were reserve-backed stablecoins like tether and USDC, there were currency boards. Under that rigid currency peg model, a country’s monetary authority commits to hold in reserve the full value of its currency in some other country’s currency and promises holders of the local currency to honor any redemption requests at a fixed exchange rate. Some currency boards have failed spectacularly – Argentina’s is the case par excellence – but some have been a force for stability and growth. Hong Kong’s “Linked Exchange Rate System,” which has pegged the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar since 1983, is mostly an example of success. That’s probably because, unlike Argentina’s agricultural export-driven economy, Hong Kong’s revolves around finance, which thrives on stability. Ending the peg would be extremely harmful to that economy, which is why hawks within the Trump Administration were reportedly keen to undermine it in retaliation for China’s increasing control over HK’s citizens. This week less trigger-happy souls apparently won the day as Trump ruled out taking such action.      Presumably, someone demonstrated to Trump the enormous harm such actions would have on American financial interests. The peg creates strong synchronicity between U.S. banks and the many foreign-owned banks (including U.S. subsidiaries) based in Hong Kong. Hurting them would diminish the United States’ global financial clout. It might also incentivize China to retaliate by dumping its giant holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds to accelerate the end of the dollar’s reserve currency status. However, as with U.S. interests in the Hong Kong peg, such actions by Beijing would be counter to China’s interests in financial stability. Whether they like it or not, both countries are joined at the hip by intertwined policy structures, forming what the financial historian Niall Ferguson and the economist Moritz Schularick described as “Chimerica.”      HOME SWEET BANK. If there’s a number from this past week that matters for the prospects of U.S. economic recovery, it’s 2.98 percent. That’s the record-low level to which U.S. mortgage rates dropped as the continued economic crisis and the Fed’s relentless monetary expansion efforts pushed benchmark bond yields ever lower. This powerful market shift has the potential to work as a countervailing force for economic recovery. Some 65 percent American households own their home, and there’s now an incentive for them to refinance their mortgages or take out a home equity loan, creating financial liquidity that’s much needed in these difficult times. Americans might not have direct access to the Fed stimulus dollars slushing around financial markets, but in this way they can turn the equity in their home into something of a bank.      MODELING VALUE. Valuing crypto assets has been a challenge for some time. How does one put a value on a token without an explicit return built into it, such as a promise of interest payments or dividends, or a real-world utility function such as oil or some other commodity? Well, analysts are still trying to figure that out, with multiple methodologies being applied. In this report, the first of two on crypto valuation by Coin Metrics, partners in our new Research Hub, Kevin Lu and other members of the team lay out a series of quite different approaches. All have some merit. But of course the lack of consistency makes it hard to settle on a commonly held market view. Should we be worried about that? How can something be considered valuable if there’s no consensus on how to measure that value? Never fear, says Coin Metrics, this is a process that takes time. And to back that up, they conclude with this statement: “The Dutch East India Company, founded in 1602, was the first corporate entity to issue bonds and shares to the public, and in doing so became the world’s first formally listed public company. It then took a period of over 300 years for the necessary foundational concepts to be developed until the formal discipline of equity valuation was established in the 1930s.”    Relevant reads    Everything We Know About the Bitcoin Scam Rocking Twitter’s Most Prominent Accounts. Among Crypto Twitter dwellers, for whom the meme flow of the cryptocurrency community is like a lifeblood, Wednesday’s massive hack against the social media platform felt profoundly disorientating. CoinDesk reporter Danny Nelson’s tick-tock breakdown makes for compelling reading on how the crisis rapidly mushroomed.      Hong Kong Citizens Turn to Stablecoins to Resist National Security Law. Hong Kongers may not yet need to fear the end of their currency’s dollar peg, but many are now fearing surveillance of their HK dollar transactions after the introduction of a new security law that aims to quell opposition to the Chinese Communist Party. Our reporter David Pan discovered that a number of them appear to have found a payment solution to avoid Beijing’s prying eyes: stablecoins.      Bank of England Considering a Central Bank Digital Currency, Governor Says. The Bank of England was one of the first major central banks to explore the prospect of a digital currency after bitcoin’s invention sparked interest in such ideas. The project then went into a kind of hiatus while former Governor Mark Carney started floating even bigger ideas with his proposal for a new digital international hegemonic currency to replace the dollar’s reserve role. Now, under new Governor Andrew Bailey, a British CBDC is back on the table, as CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports.      Five Years On, Ethereum Really Is the ‘Minecraft of Crypto-Finance’. In the 2010s, the online world-building game Minecraft enjoyed surging popularity among pre-teens and teenagers – a generation that included a young Russian-Canadian called Vitalik Buterin. This opinion piece from Camila Russo, author of the new book “The Infinite Machine,” offers a reminder of just how young Buterin was (19 years old) when he invented Ethereum.

The Malaysian Securities Commission (SC) added exchanges Binance and eToro, which offer a series of crypto-based products, to a list of companies not permitted to operate in the country.  The regulator blacklists companies that offer financial services without its approval or authorization.  It’s not clear when the SC added Binance and eToro to its non grata list. An official told CoinDesk that this information was not readily available.  Binance tested its newly launched debit card in Malaysia. The country’s currency, the ringgit, has been supported in Binance’s peer-to-peer platform since March.  In May, the SC told local media that eToro was not authorized to operate in the country and was liable for a $2.4 million fine.  Being blacklisted by the SC, however, is unlikely to disrupt either Binance’s or eToro’s local operations.  The SC does not have the authority to block websites – that rests with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), which so far has said nothing on the matter.  An eToro spokesperson told CoinDesk the company’s Asian operations are all regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission; Malaysian clients are effectively onboarded on an entity that falls out of the SC’s jurisdiction.  Binance has resisted calls to publicly divulge where it's headquartered.  Bobby Ong, COO of price aggregator CoinGecko, which is based in Malaysia, said the SC may have fired a warning shot as Binance did not get the proper licenses before it started offering a ringgit gateway for its peer-to-peer marketplace.

You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Mining Consolidation Binance is looking to consolidate more bitcoin mining hashrate to its pool in Russia and the Central Asia region. The world’s largest crypto exchange is deploying a physical server node for its pool at BitRiver, the largest bitcoin mining hosting provider in Bratsk, Russia. The move would give miner owners at BitRiver who choose to switch to Binance a better connection and direct route to its mining pool, the two firms said in an announcement Friday. In return, Binance would gain exposure and access to customers who run their machines at BitRiver, which currently operates mining facilities at a capacity of 70 megawatt (MW) out of potential capacity of 100 MW.      ConsenSys Accused In a new lawsuit, Ethereum incubator ConsenSys is accused of abusing its position of trust as an investor to access trade secrets and create a rival offering. BlockCrushr, a payments app, said it received a $100,000 investment from ConsenSys and had 20 in-depth discussions with the incubator. Now, the startup says its intellectual property was misappropriated to build ConsenSys’s own payments system Daisy Payments, since rebranded to CodeFi. Plaintiffs filed two counts of misappropriating trade secrets and one count of a breach of contract, and are suing for damages.      CBDC in Action A senior figure at the Bank of Thailand has confirmed it is already using a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for transactions with some businesses. Vachira Arromdee, the central bank's assistant governor, told reporters Wednesday the bank plans to expand the use of the digital currency among large businesses, The Nation reported. It's unclear what businesses are already using the digital currency; transactions with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will be conducted with the CBDC from September, Arromdee confirmed.      Blockchain Blueprint Beijing released a blueprint for its plans to become a blockchain hub by 2022.

Quick bites  BlockFi hires former Deutsche Bank and Barclays alum as general counsel  Crypto wallet provider Sylo targets growing India market through exchange partnership  Binance is not authorized to operate in Malaysia, says the country's financial regulator (The Block)  It's Twitter, not Bitcoin    n the aftermath of the Twitter hack, lawmakers are blaming lax cybersecurity, not Bitcoin. Following the hack, which Twitter says affected 130 accounts, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), vocal critic of tech platforms, fired off an open letter to CEO Jack Dorsey.      The event, Hawley said, “may represent not merely a coordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself.”      Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) also took aim at Twitter’s architecture. In a statement, he sounded off on the fact that users’ direct messages (DMs) lack end-to-end encryption.      “This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms. If hackers gained access to users’ DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact for years to come,” Wyden said. Wyden revealed he had met with Dorsey privately in 2018 and discussed implementing this privacy feature.      While the hack only made off with approximately $120,000, it will persist as a lasting blight on centralized internet platforms for years.      In view of Twitter’s unofficial role within politics and media as the broadcaster of all broadcasts, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) said the hack could have had “major consequences” on elections. It’s a view shared by others.      “With more than 300 million users, Twitter is a primary source of news for many, making it a target for bad actors. This type of hack by con artists for financial gain can also be a tool of foreign actors and others to spread disinformation and – as we’ve witnessed – disrupt our elections,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.      With a federal investigation underway, “the hack is likely to continue to ratchet up pressure on social media companies, which are already facing scrutiny over content moderation, disinformation and foreign interference,” CoinDesk reports.      But that doesn’t mean we’re any closer to a decentralized alternative. As Start9 Lab’s Matt Hill put it, the hack “is yet another wake-up call. And like most wakeup calls, it will be greeted with a snooze button and a growing sense of anxiety.    Market intel    First Mover The notoriously volatile bitcoin slid just 0.8% to about $9,100 on Thursday, following the largest social media hack in recent memory, which involved an amateurish crypto scam. That’s in a market where it’s not uncommon for prices to swing 8% in a day. “It’s a non-event for price,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency firm Diginex, told First Mover in an email. The reasons for the non-event revolve around the contradictory and mostly-psychological readings of the event. Little in bitcoin was stolen, all publicity is good publicity and the hack shows how easy it is to track stolen crypto. Maybe most salient: Bitcoin is worth stealing.    Opinion    Your Prime Membership Should Be Tokenized Jeff Dorman, a CoinDesk columnist and chief investment officer at Arca, thinks Amazon Prime membership should be tokenized. Tokenization offers the clearest path to show digital ownership and maintain property rights, he said, but it also offers incentives for token owners to maintain, develop and propagate their platforms. In a sense, it’s the easiest way to link shareholders and users of a platform together. “This is the only path where capitalism and socialism can converge, and we’re seeing it happen in real time. Debt, equity and tokenized digital assets will all have a place in an investor’s portfolio and, more importantly, in customers’ portfolios. The lines are likely to blur as investors become active participants in the bootstrapped growth of the companies they love,” he writes.

(Except, I am not married and have no children; it is possible that this state of affairs relates to the inordinate amount of time I spend on Twitter.) If it is related, it was worth it. But apart from that, there are normally few if any downsides.      Few, that is, until the Great Blue Checkmark Blackout the other day. For those of you living under a rock, Twitter – or, more probably, an employee of Twitter – had his or her employee login hacked (or deliberately sold) the other day. Following this, a number of well-followed accounts – Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, to name a few – posted a promise that if Twitter users would send bitcoin to a particular address, the users would get double that amount sent back to them in return.      Twitter immediately locked down all of the blue check marks while it responded to the incident. There was much rejoicing.      Usually, this scam is carried out by seizing control of the account of a lesser blue check who uses SMS two-factor authentication that points to an actual phone (rather than Google Voice). The lesser blue check gets SIM swapped, following which the attacker changes the user's profile and display name to that of a famous person (e.g. Elon Musk) and then posts the ""send me Bitcoin!"" tweet. The famous person's stans, seeing the “verified” badge and the display name (but not the lesser blue check’s less prominent user handle), promptly comply.      See also: Nic Carter – After the Twitter Hack, We Need a User-Owned Internet More Than Ever      In this instance, the fact that (a) these verified accounts had millions of followers and (b) the attack appears to have pulled back the curtain on a ""God Mode"" moderation tool makes this a story. For those of us who have been around for awhile, there’s nothing new about this scam. What makes it notable is who got hacked, not what the hackers sought to achieve.      Twitter responded by prohibiting the posting of cryptocurrency addresses.      This is most certainly not “good for Bitcoin.” Twitter is (quite properly) responding to unlawful use of its platform by preventing bad actors from exploiting the platform. But at the same time it is also preventing good actors like Balaji Srinivasan from soliciting bitcoin bounties on the platform.      Some responses from the Bitcoin community such as this from Nic Carter, called for a “user-owned internet” and decried the ""sheer centralization"" on display in this breach. Others, such as Muneeb Ali, said the breach ""accelerated us towards a decentralized web by 5 years.""      We should be careful not to overplay our hand. To start, the decentralized-ish protocols available for social media today are either clunky (ActivityPub) or un-scalable (in the case of the chains). Also, although centralization was an issue here, it does not follow that decentralization of the platform itself is the solution, as many blockchain promoters past and present claim. (See, for example, Vitalik Buterin pitching Ethereum as an identity solution to Elon Musk; the grownups in the room will be aware that Ethereum, all-singing and all-dancing in its marketing material, doesn't do everything its stans say it does.)      Decentralized solutions don’t operate as a PKI directory, like Keybase, and don’t have the ability to process meatspace ID, e.g., for driver licenses. Smart contracts can't tell us much other than that someone, somewhere, was granted permission to write to that script.    The smart move here by the crypto community is not to overreach and declare the end of the centralized web.    Furthermore, there appears to be a much simpler fix. All Twitter, or indeed any social media company needs to do, is design client-side software that authenticates (a) that a user (b) who was verified by the service and (c) was logged into the service and (d) sent a message on the service (e) signed with a key or a device that the user presented to the service when first obtaining their verification.      Such functionality would immediately alert a reader to a possible problem with the authenticity of the message. There might be a ""green check mark"" for messages that are validly signed, and a “red X” for messages that are unsigned. And the appearance of any message should be placed beyond the ability of any employee or moderator to falsify.      Even this wouldn’t prevent an attacker who gained control of the device, or knowledge of the keys, from carrying out the “send Bitcoin!” scam. But it would make it considerably harder to pull off than with weak two-factor auth and apparently unlimited moderator power.      See also: The Decentralized Web Has Plans, if Not Solutions, for the Misinformation Nightmare      Apps like Keybase and Signal have shown that strong cryptography is increasingly accessible to ordinary internet users. Long gone are the days of PGP which, per Mike Hearn, “was so bad terrorists would rather die than use it.”      The smart move here by the crypto community is not to overreach and declare the end of the centralized web. It’s to communicate to platforms that we expect client-side digital signatures and encryption in their offerings, so we can safely use online publishing platforms to send the financial communications of the future in a secure way. The alternative is that platforms will ban cryptocurrency addresses. I know which option I prefer.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Preston J.

At press time, LEND was up over 1,600% since Jan. 1, with the major part of the rally occurring over the past seven weeks.  The rapid gains look to have been driven by short-term traders and the rally may be over-extended, according to analysts at IntoTheBlock, a blockchain intelligence company.  However the token's value is also reflecting impressive growth in actual users of the lending protocol and optimism surrounding its recently launched Credit Delegation product.  Price rallies driven by fundamentals usually attract stronger buying pressure from investors.  Interestingly, the number of long-term LEND holders, as represented by addresses with coins static for more than a year, has declined 4% on a year-to-date basis to 151,730, also according to IntoTheBlock.  That may indicate early users leaving the platform, but could also further indicate activity on Aave, with holders lending out their tokens.  Meanwhile, new users, or the number of addresses holding LEND for less than a month, has grown by almost 50% in just the last 30 days.  At press time, there are 4,630 LEND addresses compared to 1,100 addresses at the end of May.  Some argue that speculative frenzy is driving prices higher, drawing in traders, and the token looks vulnerable to a sudden bout of profit-taking.  “The current rally may be overextended as retail users enter the frenzy and large players appear to be selling,” analysts at IntoTheBlock told The Defiant.  The cryptocurrency was last seen trading at $0.287, representing a 14.7% gain on a 24-hour basis, according to data source Messari.

42404902,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlF1n,1594988661,First Mover: Why Bitcoin Traders Couldn't Give a Sat About the Twitter Hack,"Cryptocurrency traders yawned at one of the year's biggest news stories for bitcoin, with prices barely budging as the digital-asset industry became a primary victim of this week's massive hack on Twitter accounts.      The notoriously volatile bitcoin slid just 0.8% to about $9,100 on Thursday after slipping a meager 0.7% on Wednesday as the news hit. That's in a market where it's not uncommon, at least until recently, for prices to swing 8% in a day.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      ""It's a non-event for price,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency firm Diginex, told First Mover in an email.      Scamming people out of their bitcoin was, at least on the surface, the goal of what the social-media platform called a ""coordinated social engineering attack."" The hackers took over the Twitter accounts of the cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, Coinbase and Gemini, as well as those of celebrities including former Vice President Joe Biden and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. CoinDesk got hit, too.      As clues on the attack continue to trickle out, cryptocurrency analysts have begun to unpack the market implications for bitcoin – some positive and some negative – and why it all washes out.      ""I think you did not see much market reaction because it was unclear what narrative would develop following the breach, and so traders were frozen,"" John Todaro, of the cryptocurrency research firm TradeBlock, wrote in an email.      1) The scale of the bitcoin obtained was relatively small. PRICE IMPACT: NEUTRAL.      The bitcoin obtained through the hack amounted to roughly $120,000, a tiny fraction of the cryptocurrency's $168 billion market capitalization. Less than one 10-millionth, in fact. That's not too far off from the scale of the satoshi, or ""sat,"" which is the smallest unit of bitcoin, at one 100-millionth. Last year alone, there were at least seven major cryptocurrency exchange hacks, including $40 million from Binance and $49 million from South Korea's Upbit.      ""The one thing that could have made it a bigger deal is if the hackers got more than $100K,"" Martin Garcia, managing director at the cryptocurrency trading firm Genesis, wrote in an email. ""If they had raised like $100 million, then I guarantee BTC would have sold off, as the market would have expected the hackers to sell to fiat somewhere, crushing the price. But given the amount, no big deal.""      (Genesis is owned by the investment firm Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)      2) No publicity is bad publicity. PRICE IMPACT: POSITIVE.      The episode could aid bitcoin's name recognition, which theoretically could accelerate consumer adoption, at least on the margin. News articles about the hack appeared in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and many other mainstream U.S. publications. The story was widely discussed on Twitter. Interest in the keyword ""bitcoin"" briefly surged on Google.      ""While I don't condone the incident in any way, I must admit I'm pleased to see the rapid surge in popularity of bitcoin it has caused,"" Jay Hao, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. ""The hack itself is unfortunate, of course, but thanks to Twitter, bitcoin is grabbing the headlines again, and that can only be a good thing in the push to wider adoption.""      3) The episode could invite further regulatory and law-enforcement scrutiny of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. PRICE IMPACT: NEGATIVE.      The FBI said Thursday it's investigating the event. U.S. Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, called on Twitter to cooperate. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo directed the state to conduct a full investigation.      ""Yesterday's attack targeted the Twitter accounts of virtual currency companies,"" Linda Lacewell, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, said in a statement. ""The department will leverage its deep expertise to bring the facts to light.""      4) The attack highlights the benefits of bitcoin's decentralized network. PRICE IMPACT: POSITIVE.      The fact Twitter's systems appear to have been hacked could redirect attention to the fact that the Bitcoin blockchain is a distributed network of computers, reducing central points of failure or weakness.      ""It showcases weaknesses in centralized systems and a need for more decentralized applications,"" Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, told First Mover in a WhatsApp message.      5) Early efforts to track down the perpetrator and scammed bitcoin highlight the transparency of the blockchain network. PRICE IMPACT: POSITIVE.      Private cryptocurrency-forensic firms including Chainalysis, CipherTrace and Elliptic have already started to probe the event, using publicly available data from the Bitcoin blockchain. As reported by CoinDesk's Will Foxley, it appears the hacker was a trader on the crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, and it's pretty straightforward to document the inflows of bitcoin into the hacker's listed account address as the scam unfolded.      ""You can track the crypto coming into the hacker crypto addresses,"" the Binance-owned data website CoinMarketCap wrote Thursday in a blog post.      6) Bitcoin is worth stealing. PRICE IMPACT: POSITIVE.      The billionaire investor Warren Buffett has said that bitcoin has ""no value."" If that was the case, why steal it?      ""If anything, it just proves that bitcoin is a form of a valuable money that a hacker might want,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the cryptocurrency investment manager Arca, told First Mover in an email.      7) Cryptocurrency is so frequently used in scams that the latest episode isn't really all that surprising. PRICE IMPACT: NEUTRAL.      ""To say that everybody now knows that hackers prefer bitcoin has no effect, because everybody knows that already,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, said in a phone interview.      8) The event could raise awareness of the imperative for security precautions among new cryptocurrency investors. It also might scare some would-be investors away. PRICE IMPACT: NEUTRAL.      CoinDesk's Leigh Cuen reported Thursday that many authentic Twitter users were no longer able to tweet bitcoin addresses.      ""That has a huge silver lining, because it's not good practice to publish your public key,"" Greenspan said. ""That'll probably save a couple noobs from making noob mistakes.""    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,115 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,157 | 24-Hr Low: $9,066      Trend: Bitcoin continues to stubbornly trade within a tight range above $9,000. The leading cryptocurrency hasn't had a 5% daily move for 24 straight days, the longest stretch of such low daily volatility since the end of March 2019.      Prolonged periods of price consolidation tend to end with a sudden violent move on either side. So far, however, the cryptocurrency has refused to wake from its multi-month slumber.      Technical studies indicate scope for a price drop in the short-term. For instance, the four-hour chart shows a failed breakout, a bearish sign. Meanwhile, the daily chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend strength and trend changes, has crossed below zero in favor of the bears.      In addition, put options (or bearish bets) expiring in one- and three-months are drawing higher prices (or stronger demand) than call options (or bullish bets). As such, it seems traders are anticipating a sell-off.      Immediate support is located at $9,000, which if breached, would shift the focus to $8,630 – the support of the higher low created on May 27. Meanwhile, resistance is seen at $9,480 (July 8 high). A move above that level is needed to invalidate a bearish lower-highs setup on the 4-hour chart and open the doors for $9,800-$10,000.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/17/first-mover-why-bitcoin-traders-couldnt-give-a-sat-about-the-twitter-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc606568ea1582e496e755f8aafff3ba24a3f32d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It's unclear what businesses are already using the digital currency; transactions with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will be conducted with the CBDC from September, Arromdee confirmed.  Thailand's CBDC is backed by the central bank's currency reserves; BOT data shows its foreign currency reserves have grown by more than $25 billion over the past 12 months.  Access to the general public, complete with a state-backed wallet provider, is currently under consideration.

Ever since India’s Supreme Court overturned central bank restrictions for crypto exchanges back in March, interest from traders and investors around digital assets in India has soared.  Now, Sylo and Bitbns want to capitalize on the growing demand by easing the process of buying and storing crypto assets for India's residents through the Sylo Smart Wallet.  According to New Zealand-based Sylo, sign-ups to the wallet app from India saw a 500% increase in the second quarter of this year, with local users making up 30% of the wallet's 250,000 users.  In the face of recent restrictions placed on social media platforms including WeChat and TikTok, Bitbns CEO Gaurav Dahake says India has been presented an opportunity to offer a ""WeChat of sorts"" platform, without compromising on privacy.  Sylo's wallet app (available on iOS and Android) is able to store, send and spend cryptocurrencies via a decentralized browser based on Ethereum.  It also allows messaging and video and audio calls.  The partners add the app can offer a solution for India's unbanked, only needing a phone number or email address needed to sign up.  Sylo's app is a key part of a project enabling users to buy Coke with bitcoin at 2,000 vending machines in Australia and New Zealand.  Bitbns is based in Banglore, Karnataka.

6861,http://blokt.com/?p=51558,1594979747,Namecheap VPN Review – Does It Live Up To The Hype?,"Namecheap is best known as an American domain name registrar and web hosting provider, who have been operating for 20 years since the early days of the internet. With over 11 million users and a highly trusted reputation, Namecheap has grown into one of the largest registrars in the world. Namecheap has long been an advocate of private and free internet access, campaigning for net neutrality and open communications for all. They’ve proven their commitment to this cause through various fundraising efforts and shows of support for internet freedom causes – which should come as a great accolade for those users concerned with their privacy online. Namecheap VPN Review – Does It Live Up To The Hype? More recently, Namecheap has begun offering other services, one of which is their VPN solution. Although Namecheap’s VPN started life as a relatively simple service, it’s been built upon and seriously upgraded over the last few years. It can now hold its own against other leading VPN services. As a result, we don’t think that current reviews do Namecheap’s new-and-improved VPN justice. So, we’re going to explore what makes Namecheap’s VPN an excellent choice for 2020 and examine some of the leading features this VPN service has to offer. Namecheap VPN Special Features Namecheap is loaded with great features at an affordable price. Namecheap’s VPN does all the things you would expect of a regular VPN service. Still, there are a few extra features that Namecheap offers, which make it stand out from the competition and rub shoulders with the most popular VPN providers like NordVPN , ExpressVPN , etc. These include: Over 1,000 servers – Unlike some smaller VPN operators, Namecheap uses over 1,000 server locations so its users can always enjoy uninterrupted access to VPN connections all over the world. This includes popular locations in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia. DNS leak protection – Domain name systems, or ‘DNS’ is described as the ‘phonebook’ of the internet, and it can reveal specific information about you when you connect to websites. Namecheap’s VPN service prevents this information from being leaked when you surf the web. Strong data encryption – Namecheap uses leading VPN protocols to ensure that user data is encrypted. These include OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols, which provide military-grade traffic encryption. Unlimited device support – One of the best features of Namecheap’s VPN service is its unlimited amount of connected devices. This means customers can connect any device, regardless of the operating system, in their home, or even share their connection with friends and family. ISP throttling avoidance – Some ISPs use ‘packet sniffing’ to examine your data and restrict browsing while you’re using a VPN. With Namecheap, ISPs are prevented from restricting your internet access using these methods. Random IP addresses – Some VPN providers will simply use the IP address of the data center or server you connect to, which makes it obvious you’re connecting via a VPN. However, Namecheap assigns each user a random IP address while keeping your true IP and location hidden. Useful Extra Features In addition to its core features, Namecheap’s VPN service has a range of other features which make it even better value for money, including: Strict no-logs policy – Namecheap promises that it never keeps logs on its customers’ browsing history, nor does it track or store data from your VPN sessions. Round the clock live support – There’s 24/7 live support available from Namecheap, so if you’re having any problems with installation or connecting to your VPN, you can chat with a representative. Kill switch – If your VPN connection suddenly drops out for any reason, Namecheap will block all incoming and outgoing traffic to ensure none of your data leaves your device unencrypted. How Fast Is Namecheap’s VPN? If you’re a power user, or you regularly use VPNs to stream content, you’ll want to know how fast Namecheap performs – and you’ll be pleasantly surprised! As Namecheap owns the servers they run their VPNs on, they can guarantee better speeds than some other leading providers, which is great for those who want uninterrupted connections when streaming video content or gaming. There’s also unlimited bandwidth available through Namecheap’s VPN, which means that you’ll never have your streaming restricted to save on data. As we’ll look at below, Namecheap also displays the ping of each server next to it within their desktop apps, which is great for seeing at a glance what the fastest server for your location is. Which Operating Systems Does Namecheap’s VPN Work With? All major operating systems can use Namecheap’s VPN service, with full clients for Windows , iOS , macOS , Android , Linux, and most brands of router . These clients are easy to download – once you’ve started your membership, either with a paid plan or free trial, Namecheap will prompt you to download the client that’s right for you or show you how to manually set-up their VPN on your device or router. Namecheap has a full client for every major operating system. Namecheap’s VPN was quick and easy to install on Windows, as you can see in the screenshot above. Their user interface is very simple to navigate, offering a huge range of server locations to choose from at the click of a button. Beside each server location is a live and updated ‘ping time’ – the time it takes to communicate with each server. This is great for power users who want to connect to the fastest possible VPN server, and it’s a feature we haven’t seen elsewhere. Clicking on the drop-down menu at the side of each server location will reveal additional options for selecting a specific city location within that country – for example, within the US, users can select multiple cities such as Boston, Las Vegas, Seattle, and more. Alternatively, you can simply click ‘connect VPN,’ and Namecheap will connect users to the fastest server available. On all clients and devices, Namecheap’s VPN opens at startup, and there’s a handy option to auto-connect as soon as the app is launched – which means you’ll always be protected when you browse. You can also use the client to change which VPN protocol you connect to, such as IKEv2 or OpenVPN. How Much Does Namecheap’s VPN Service Cost? Namecheap is one of the most affordable VPN services in the world, and it’s also one of the few that offers a completely free trial for a month to new users. A one-year subscription costs just $1 per month for the first 12 months, billed at $12.00 for the first year and then $34.56 for each year after that. Personally, we recommend taking advantage of Namecheap’s 3-year plan. At just $1.88 per month, users can save 68% on the normal monthly subscription price, billed in a single lump sum of $67.68. Whichever plan you choose, Namecheap’s VPN works out as one of the most cost-effective VPN services on the market, rivaled only by the likes of SurfShark , which is very affordable too. If you choose to start a free trial, you will need some payment information, but you won’t be billed until your first month is up. Most other VPN providers offer a couple of days free protection or restrict usage by data – but Namecheap’s free trial offers all of the features you’d get in the full version. There’s also a 30-day money-back guarantee, which means even if you change your mind about Namecheap’s service, you won’t be out of pocket. Subscription Length Cost Per Month Monthly Free month, then $5.88/Month Yearly $1/month for the first year, then $2.88/month 3 Years $1.88 Namecheap VPN – Our Verdict Overall, Namecheap’s VPN offers amazing value for money and a very comprehensive VPN service, which is both easy to use and provides plenty of protection for any level of user. One of our favorite features has to be Namecheap’s huge range of servers – over 1,000 in total based in over 75 locations – which not only contributes to a stable and secure VPN connection, but they also offer a good level of location variety for users. Likewise, we think that Namecheap’s unlimited device support offers great value for money as it can essentially be used to cover a whole household of devices using just one subscription, or shared among friends. Unlimited devices and a huge range of servers are also available from other providers, but only really the top few. As a result, Namecheap’s VPN service is above average. When comparing other budget VPN options, it’s incredibly difficult to find a provider that offers the same amount of servers as Namecheap does for the same price. Although we only reviewed their Windows client, it was easy to use and incredibly fast to install. The user interface was easy to navigate even for beginners, while also providing plenty of advanced options for users who demand more from their VPN. We expect this is similar across all operating systems and clients. Namecheap’s 24/7 live chat support, where you can speak to a real representative, is also a great feature that many other VPN providers at this price point don’t currently offer. Most current reviews on Namecheap’s VPN service were written before many of these new features were added, and we really think that Namecheap deserves more attention – as it provides all-round performance for any level of user, and brings Namecheap’s long experience and trustworthiness to a VPN service.

42404863,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlEuu,1594951500,Binance Pool Poised to Grab More Bitcoin Hashrate in Russia and Central Asia,"Binance is looking to consolidate more bitcoin mining hashrate to its pool in Russia and the Central Asia region.      The world's largest crypto exchange is deploying a physical server node for its pool at BitRiver, the largest bitcoin mining hosting provider in Bratsk, Russia. The move would give miner owners at BitRiver who choose to switch to Binance a better connection and direct route to its mining pool, the two firms said in an announcement Friday.      In return, Binance would gain exposure and access to customers who run their machines at BitRiver, which currently operates mining facilities at a capacity of 70 megawatt (MW) out of a full capacity of 100 MW.      According to the Bitcoin mining map compiled by the Center for Alternative Finance, affiliated with the University of Cambridge, the current monthly average hashrate from miners in Russia is at 6.08% of the network's total, with a slight growth from 5.93% that was reported in September 2019.      See also: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sets New Record High 2 Months After Halving      Similarly, miners in Kazakhstan are estimated to contribute to 3.14% of Bitcoin's total hashrate, which has grown from 1.42% that was recorded in Q3 last year. Meanwhile, the map shows China's average Bitcoin hashrate dominance has dropped slightly from 75% recorded in Q3 2019 to now 71%.      Currently, nine out the 10 biggest bitcoin mining pools by hash rate are either home-grown companies in China or owned by crypto exchanges with strong roots in the Chinese market.      If assuming on average customers at BitRiver are using relatively more state-of-the-art bitcoin mining machines, like Bitmain's AntMiner S17s or equivalent models with an efficiency level of about 50 watt per terahash second (W/T), BitRiver's bitcoin mining farms could boast a total hashrate of over 1,000 petahash per second (PH/s).      While that level of hashrate may only account for about 1% of the total computing power on Bitcoin, the deal underscores Binance's strategy of absorbing bitcoin miners in different regions – with somewhat aggressive pricing plans since its launch – into its exchange functions, including spots, futures and margin trading.      “Binance Pool offers a highly competitive fee structure to institutional-scale miners, who are the customers of our data center,"" Igor Runets, CEO at BitRiver said in the announcement.      He estimates that up to 50% of the farms' hashrate from its customers may switch to Binance Pool, following the deal. These clients will mostly switch from the Bitmain controlled BTC.com pool, Runets added.      The two parties did not disclose whether or how Binance is offering discounted fees to attract customers at BitRiver. But lower-than-market rate is one of the key measures that Binance has taken to stir up the Bitcoin mining pool competition even though the revenue made from such business is negligible compared to its trading side. Binance is also reaching out to the miners in Kazakhstan, two of them told CoinDesk.      See also: Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Drops 3 Directors in Possible Boardroom Coup      The exchange rolled out its bitcoin mining service in late April, has amassed around 7,000 PH/s of bitcoin hashrate and is currently the eighth-biggest bitcoin mining pool, following its competitors Huobi and OKEx.      It adopted the so called Fully-Pay-Per-Share (FPPS) model and initially offered zero fees and right now charges less than 2.5%. But in some cases, the fee offered to large-scale miner operators can be below 1%. Meanwhile, other major bitcoin mining pools like F2Pool and PoolIn have reduced their fees from previously 4% to 2.5%, although larger customers also do have the flexibility of a further discount.      The FPPS model means a pool only charges an agreed fee for the block subsidy in every block it mined and then distribute the block subsidies as well as transaction fees to miners proportionally based on their contribution.      Based on a Binance Pool business proposal deck CoinDesk obtained, the exchange categorizes its miner customers into nine levels. Those with over 500 PH/s are labeled as VIP9, the highest ranking, which would equal to a VIP9 in its trading business, who are offered an exchange trading fee of as low as 0.015%.      Bitcoin blockchain data shows Binance Pool has mined 485 blocks as of writing since it went live with total block subsidies of over 3,000 bitcoin. Even at a 2.5% fee, the fees generated would be around half a million dollars.
