Copyright infringement can occur when an NFT is created from a creative work without permission from the creators and owners. There have been several legal disputes in the U.K. and U.S.  “Artists are at risk of seeing the fruits of their hard work pinched and promoted without permission while fraudulent and misleading adverts add an extra layer of jeopardy for investors involved in what is already an inherently risky business,” Dame Caroline Dinenage MP, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said in an accompanying press release.  The group started an inquiry into NFTs in November.  Some U.K. football clubs have been releasing tokens that give members access to membership perks like voting on club decisions, merchandise and unique experiences.  “We are also concerned that clubs may present fan tokens as an appropriate form of fan engagement in the future, despite their price volatility and reservations among fan groups,” the report said.  Football fans speculating on sports-based crypto assets could cause financial harm to fans as well as hurt the reputation of football clubs, the committee said.  “In the world of sport, clubs are promoting volatile crypto asset schemes to extract additional money from loyal supporters, often with promises of privileges and perks that fail to materialize,” Dinenage said in the press release.  The committee also asked those who promote NFTs to take responsibility to protect consumers.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/10/uk-group-calls-for-nft-copyright-infringement-safeguards-and-code-of-conduct,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af7338c6f8be122aa08c373d7f4daf7be15e0a9b-1536x864.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392341,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5Uen,1696978860,"Tokenized RWA Platform Untangled Goes Live, Gets $13.5M Funding to Bring Private Credit On-Chain","Tokenized real-world asset (RWA) marketplace Untangled Finance went live Wednesday on the Celo network after securing a $13.5 million venture capital boost to bring tokenized private credit to the blockchain, the company told CoinDesk.  The lead investor was London-based asset management firm Fasanara Capital, which has also opened two credit pools on the platform, handling off-chain operations and underwriting loans.  Untangled also announced plans to expand to Ethereum [ETH] and layer 2 network Polygon [MATIC] via Chainlink’s [LINK] Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol, making the platform a multichain and interoperable RWA credit protocol.  The development comes as asset tokenization emerged as one of the key growth opportunities in the digital asset industry, still reeling from a grueling bear market and last year’s high-profile implosions. Tokenization refers to placing traditional financial assets such as credit, real estate or bonds – so-called real-world assets – on a blockchain.  The market of tokenized assets could mushroom to $5 trillion in the next five years, bringing operational efficiencies and improving liquidity and accessibility for investors and asset managers, Bernstein said in a report earlier this year.  Read more: The Trillion Dollar Crypto Opportunity: Real World Asset Tokenization  Tokenization of private credit markets  Untangled aims to bring the traditional private credit market – currently more than $1 trillion in size – to blockchains via tokenization. The current size of private credit on decentralized finance (DeFi) rails only totals $550 million of assets, according to rwa.xyz data.  Manrui Tang and Quan Le, co-founders of Untangled, said in an interview with CoinDesk that the platform focuses on fintech lending – for example invoice financing and consumer loans based on salary advances – and so-called “green assets,” such as working capital or development loans for green infrastructure projects like battery swapping stations,  Untangled provides infrastructure to host blockchain-based credit pools, where investors – in this case, certified investors, firms, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – deposit funds to lend and earn a yield. Depositors receive an ERC-20 token that represents their positions.  The platform brings a few novelties among RWA lending protocols, the co-founders explained. It has a built-in liquidation engine that may auction off certain collateral assets to improve the pool’s overall health if it falls below a certain threshold. The company has crafted a forward-looking credit assessment model that monitors the borrower’s future default risks. The protocol also offers an auction-based withdrawal mechanism for investors who want to exit the pools early.  “We see an upcoming merging of worlds,” Francesco Filia, CEO and CIO of Fasanara Capital, said in a statement. “On one side, fintech lending which fills the gap in underserved SME and consumer markets and, on the other, the way values are being transferred within the new world of digital assets.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/10/tokenized-rwa-platform-untangled-goes-live-gets-135m-funding-to-bring-private-credit-on-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d63cb76ad70913dbca6f1cbb73ddbfb0bf3454c-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
18620853,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554868,1696978833,Trademark Tussle: Trader Joe’s Grocery Slaps Lawsuit On DEX Trading Platform,"Trader Joe’s, a well-known supermarket chain in the United States, has taken legal action against a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform named Trader Joe, alleging that it has violated federal trademark laws. The DEX platform, which operates under the domain name traderjoexyz.com, not only shares the same name as the supermarket but, according to recent reports, also appears to be trying to leverage the supermarket’s established brand and reputation. US Supermarket Giant Locks Horns With Trader Joe DEX Trader Joe’s has gained popularity in the digital realm by initially launching on the Avalanche (AVAX) network and later expanding its presence to BNB Chain, Arbitrum (ARB), and Ethereum (ETH). It currently holds over $77 million worth of tokens across various chains and has processed trades amounting to $25 million in September alone. However, its success has been overshadowed by a heated dispute regarding the origin of its brand and allegations of fraudulent attempts to misrepresent its origins. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Fell Toward $1,500 Trader Joe’s supermarket chain has grown increasingly frustrated by the lack of response to its requests to cease the misuse of its trademark. As a result, the matter has escalated internationally, and a complaint was filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in May 2022 to force the crypto entity to relinquish its domain name. Furthermore, recently filed court documents in the US District Court for the Central District of California shed light on the proceedings at WIPO. According to these documents, the defendants presented a false narrative that distorted the true origins of “Trader Joe’s.” They claimed that the platform was named after the co-founder’s brother, a claim that Trader Joe’s supermarket chain has vehemently denied. JOE Token Plummets In Value Amidst Legal Battle Trader Joe DEX has recently seen notable variations in several critical metrics, with shifts in trading volume, market capitalization, revenue, and total value locked. Over the past 24 hours, Trader Joe’s experienced a decline of 1.68% in its performance. This short-term dip in value has been reflected in the platform’s seven-day performance, with a 3.85% decrease. However, despite these recent setbacks, the DEX has managed to maintain relative stability over 30 days, with a modest decline of 1.04%. According to Token Terminal data, one of the most striking figures is the platform’s 180-day performance, which shows a significant drop of 60.82%. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Struggles To Stay Above $0.26: What This Means For Traders Nevertheless, when considering market capitalization, Trader Joe’s DEX boasts a circulating market cap of $90.84 million, indicating its prominence within the DEX ecosystem. Moreover, the platform has shown a positive trend, with a recent increase of 2.26%. Total value locked (TVL) is another crucial metric used to assess the health and popularity of a DEX platform. Despite the recent market fluctuations, Trader Joe DEX continues demonstrating a TVL of $78.66 million. However, it experienced a decline of 4.54%, suggesting a potential shift in user participation and liquidity within the platform. Finally, trading volume, an essential measure of a platform’s activity, has witnessed a significant annualized decrease of 18.45%, amounting to $7.61 billion. This decline in trading volume raises concerns about engagement and participation on the Trader Joe DEX platform.

Related Reading: Binance Faces Scrutiny Over Alleged ICO Missteps And Token Distribution Discrepancies Binance And Israel Work Together To Freeze Crypto A local news media Calculist report confirmed an operation led by the Israeli Police Department and the National Counterterrorism Headquarters, part of the Ministry of Defense. The operation was supported by the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance. During the operation, the law enforcement agencies discovered funds raised by the terrorist group via crypto donations. The investigation led the cyber unit from the Israeli Police to the crypto trading venue. The terrorist group launched the campaign in the past few days. The law enforcement agencies claimed that Hamas used the attention from Sunday’s attack to raise money from radicals and supporters worldwide. The terrorist group, the report claims, turned to social media platforms to launch the campaign. A spokesperson for the law enforcement agencies told Calculist the following regarding the events: As the war broke out, Hamas launched a fundraising campaign on social networks, asking the public to deposit crypto into its account. The cyber unit and the NSC have been working immediately to locate and freeze the accounts, assisted by the Crypto Exchange (Binance), to freeze the funds (…). The report claims that Binance has been aware of Hamas’s operation on its platform. In a separate report from CoinDesk, some data suggests previous cooperation between Binance and Israeli law enforcement. The company helped Israel to freeze almost 200 accounts connected to Hamas and other terrorist groups. A spokesperson for the crypto exchange told CoinDesk: Over the past few days, our team has been working in real-time, around the clock to support ongoing efforts to combat terror financing. We are committed to ensuring the safety and security not just of the blockchain ecosystem, but also the global community, through our proactive work. Following the events of the past Sunday, the conflict between Israel and Hamas escalated. The nation-state declared war on the terrorist organization and appeared to be preparing to increase its offensive on the Gaza Strip in response to the terrorist group.

18616252,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554842,1696971639,Crypto Analyst Identifies 6 Overlooked Altcoins That Could Be Due For A Price Surge,"With tens of thousands of altcoins circulating the market, crypto investors can easily miss out on the next 100x coin due to it not being on their radar. This is often not the fault of the investor as it can be hard to keep track of so many coins. As a result of this, a Santiment analyst has presented a total of 6 overlooked altcoins that could be primed for a rally. Crypto Analyst Presents Altcoins Using Network Activity As pointed out by the crypto analyst in the Santiment post, the altcoins outlined were picked due to an uptick in their network activity. These tokens have been able to stay under the radar but their activities spread across transaction volumes, network growth, and large transaction numbers, among others, have caught attention. Related Reading: Why Does Ripple Return Unlocked Tokens To Escrow? Pro-XRP Lawyer Provides Answers “The extra juicy opportunities lie with projects that maybe haven’t seen any special price decouplings recently, yet have a surge in network growth, or whale transactions and accumulation.” He further added that these projects are “at minimum, likely to have some increased volatility due to extra activity that hasn’t existed on their respective networks in quite some time.” 1 – Bancor (BNT) Emerges Top Of Altcoins List As outlined in the post, the Bancor Network, a permissionless protocol that caters to open-source DeFi protocols, has seen a notable rise in its network metrics. This spans across high transaction volumes, active addresses, network growth, whale transactions, exchange inflows, and age destroyed (Consumed). This could be a predecessor to a rise in the BNT price. Source: Santiment 2 – Cartesi (CTSI) The application-specific rollups Cartesi network which features a Linux runtime has also seen a rise in metrics similar to Bancor that could signal a rise in its native CTSI token. This also spans “High Transaction Volume, Active Addresses, Whale Transactions, Age Destroyed (Consumed)” as pointed out in the post. Source: Santiment 3 – Holo (HOT) Holo (HOT) on the Holochain allows for Peer-To-Peer (P2P) applications and has made it to this list mainly due to its whale transactions. The Santiment post shows a rise in whale accumulation among addresses holding between $100,000 and $1 million, as well as high whale transactions, exchange inflows, and age destroyed (Consumed). Source: Santiment 4 – Powerpool (CVP) The Powerpool (CVP) protocol is a governance-facing protocol that has seen similar trends to Holo (HOT) above. Just like Holo, there has been accumulation among whales holding $100,000 to $1 million. “High Active Addresses, Network Growth, $100K-$1M Whale Accumulation, Age Destroyed (Consumed),” the analyst writes. Source: Santiment 5 – Storj (STORJ) The Storj (STORJ) project is one that aims to provide cleaner storage services, allowing organizations to cut down their carbon footprint as well as reduce their cloud storage costs. But this under-the-radar altcoin has made it into the list. The analyst points to “High Transaction Volume, Active Addresses, Network Growth, Whale Accumulation, Age Destroyed (Consumed)” as shown in the chart. Source: Santiment 6 – UniLend (UFT) Unilend (UFT), a protocol that brings all decentralized finance (DeFi) trading to offer in one place, making them accessible through smart contracts, has seen a rise in activity as well. Coming up as the 6th altcoin on the list, Unilend’s growth spans “High Transaction Volume, Active Addresses, Network Growth, Whale Transactions, $100K-$1M Whale Accumulation, Exchange Inflow.” Source: Santiment Altcoins: Exercise Caution With These Cryptos Although these assets have seen a lot of increase in their network activities, the crypto analyst warns that “It appears that 4 out of these 6 highlighted projects are likely getting hot network activity BECAUSE of the price pump. For the other 2, there are no guarantees that a pump is around the corner.” Related Reading: These Bullish Factors Prove XRP Price Rally Is Not Over Yet However, as always, crypto investors are urged to “make your own assessments, research these and the many other projects that show similar hot network activity on this model in weeks to come.” Total market cap sitting at $1.045 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Featured image from Busha, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-analyst-overlooked-altcoins/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The crypto was down 0.73% over the past 24 hours and was changing hands at $27,395 towards the close of business U.S. East Coast time. Ether [ETH] was down 0.96% and trading at $1,546. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was lower by 0.9%. CoinDesk Indicies’ Bitcoin Trend Indicator shows a significant uptrend predicted for bitcoin’s price while the ether trend indicator is forecasting a significant downtrend.  In equities markets, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose a bit more than 0.5%, ignoring for a second day the possible negative effects from the Israel-Hamas conflict.  Speaking with CNBC on Tuesday, Mark Newton of Fundstrat anticipates a buying opportunity, saying there’s a “good likelihood” the bottom is in for stocks. Newton expects a short-lived market decline due to geopolitical events to be followed by a rebound.  Big Week for Unlocks  Aptos [APT], and Ape Coin [APE] are all scheduled to undergo large token unlocks in the next week.  Token unlocks can temporarily depress crypto prices, but when liquidity freed represents over 100% of daily volume, prices rebound briefly before falling further within two weeks, according to research by The Tie previously reported by CoinDesk.  Aptos is scheduled to unlock 4.54 million [APT] on Wednesday, worth around $22.2 million based on current market prices. APT is down 2.2% on day and 9% on week.  Meanwhile, Ape Coin is going to unlock 15.6 million [APE] $15.88 million later this week, and its token is down 1% on-day and 11.3% on-week.  Rising BTC dominance  Meanwhile, bitcoin’s grip on the overall cryptocurrency market has been rising relentlessly. The [BTC] market cap dominance metric rose above 51%, its highest reading since July, according to TradingView data.  “Despite the recent global turmoil, bitcoin has demonstrated exceptional strength, securing its position as the top-performing asset over the past 30 days relative to the US Dollar,” Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, noted in an email. He attributed BTC’s rising dominance to the second-largest crypto asset [ETH’s] stronger correlation with risk sentiment and its increasing token supply after reverting to being inflationary, making bitcoin more attractive for investors.  [ETH] this week has dropped to a fresh 15-month low relative to BTC amid slumping blockchain activity on Ethereum and dismal investor interest for newly listed futures-based ETFs in the U.S.  K33 Research noted in a Wednesday market report that traders on the derivatives market anticipate that ETH will keep underperforming.  “The explanation can simply be that BTC as digital gold in a risk-off environment, sprinkled with the potential of spot bitcoin ETFs soon, is more enticing than the DeFi and NFT-associated ETH,” K33 analysts wrote. “Sticking to BTC until there is clear proof of a spark in ETH is likely the safest exposure for the time being.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | APT | APE,BTC | ETH | MARKET | APT | APE,"Sam Reynolds, Krisztian Sandor",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/10/bitcoin-hovers-above-27000-as-us-stocks-advance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72a5e6b7481d1eb878469363efd2bafce0901ebe-2233x1256.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This plunge, in turn, triggered a series of liquidation events that have seen ETH traders suffer massive losses in the last day. Ethereum Liquidation Volumes Cross $30 Million. By Tuesday, October 10, the Ethereum liquidation numbers triggered by the price crash ramped up quickly to cross the $32 million market. As expected, long traders suffered the majority of the losses with Coinglass data pointing to 87.61% of all ETH liquidation volumes coming from long traders. Related Reading: Top 5 Altcoins For October 2023 That Could 20X Your Crypto Portfolio This meant that of the over $32 million in liquidation volumes recorded for the asset in the past day, $29.56 million were from long positions. This meant that only $2.91 million in short positions were liquidated. ETH liquidations cross $30 million | Source: CoinGlass Ethereum also snagged the crown for the largest single liquidation event for the 24-hour period. The trade was placed on the Binance crypto exchange across the ETHBUSD pair with a total value of $4.53 million by the time the liquidation occurred. Ethereum’s volumes also put it ahead of Bitcoin for the same time period when Bitcoin usually tends to lead liquidation volumes. In the 24-hour timeframe, Bitcoin liquidation volumes came out to $19.28 million compared to $32.48 million for Ethereum. But just like ETH, the vast majority of the liquidation volumes for BTC were from long traders. ETH price struggles below $1,600 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Over 20,500 Crypto Traders Suffer Losses The liquidation volumes over the last day have been nowhere near the highest for the year but that does not make it any less significant. CoinGlass’s data shows that as of the time of writing, 20,525 crypto traders have been liquidated for a total of $56.42 million. Of this figure, long traders have accounted for $44.9 million in losses, and short traders for $11.48 million. Besides Bitcoin and Ethereum, the other assets that saw notable volumes were Bitcoin Cash (BCH) with $3.59 million, XRP with $2.77 million, and Solana (SOL) with $2.75 million. Related Reading: Crypto Investor Buying Power Just Reached A 6-Month High, What This Means The Binance exchange accounted for the largest volumes at $24.86 million, followed by the OKX exchange with $17.16 million. Next on the list is ByBit with $6.90 million, Huobi with $5.8 million, and the CoinEx exchange which rounded off the top 5 with $1.05 million. If there continues to be any large swing in prices like what was witnessed on Monday, then the liquidation volumes are expected to continue. The only way these volumes will remain low is if assets in the market continue to trade in a tight range.

42392338,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5UUX,1696966634,Defending the Indefensible? Sam Bankman-Fried’s Lawyers Deserve Better,"Don’t count your chickens before they hatch. Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial is well underway, and many are acting like the fight to convict the millennial Charles Ponzi is already won. It is true that the evidence presented so far appears damning, and that the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in conviction. And there’s much to say about SBF’s attorney’s wet fart of a legal strategy, so far. But the old boy hasn’t yet been found guilty by a jury of his peers, and that matters.  So, I say, for the sake of humility and tact — let’s curb the bloodlust.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Last week, during the first days of a trial that could extend six weeks, there was much rejoicing over the fact that SBF’s high-paid lawyers made an embarrassing initial showing. According to some estimates, District Judge Lewis Kaplan, a former prosecutor who is overseeing SBF’s case, rebutted 60% of attorney Christian Everdell’s questions during a cross-examination. At one point, former FTX dev (and longtime friend of SBF), Adam Yedidia, came right out and said he was ride or die for his former boss up until it became obvious SBF had “defrauded” his customers, a point that was stricken from the record but is impossible to forget.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried, Other FTX Execs Committed Fraud: Gary Wang  But, again, the show is not over. What happens in the courtroom matters for this trial, and also the legal harranging that will almost certainly follow. If it’s true that trials are a type of theater (afterall, both lawyers and actors are paid liars), then special attention should be given to the performance of everyone in the courtroom. The actions and motions and statements offered today as well as the trial’s overall direction will become the “facts and circumstances” considered in an appeal.  While many onlookers in the crowded overflow rooms at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse in New York are likely thankful for Judge Kaplan’s ability to move the case forward (to say nothing of the schadenfreude many might feel seeing team SBF squirm), there’s a case to be made Kaplan should be a little more sporting, a little more judicial.  Afterall, a 31-year-old man could be locked away in a federal penitentiary for over 100 years.  This is a point attorney Sam Enzer, a partner with law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel, brought up in a recent episode of “Unchained.” Although it’s not known if SBF’s lawyers are angling for a mistrial or to appeal a possible conviction, Enzer said that there may be grounds for that if not given a fair shake.  At one point last week, Judge Kaplan reprimanded defense attorney Everdell for asking questions about already established facts. “I just want to express my growing concern about the extent of the entirely unnecessary repetition, and I’ve given you a lot of latitude,” Judge Kaplan said on Thursday. “You’re wearing out the welcome on the repetition.”  These comments were made, seemingly, when the jury was out of earshot. However, there’s an argument to make that every objection Kaplan sustains against SBF’s lawyers hurts the accused far more than it satisfies the court. What exactly is lost by allowing an attorney the ability to ask a few questions? A few minutes?  These things cannot exactly be quantified, but conceivably, what’s lost is the defense’s momentum, self-confidence and the goodwill they can build up with a jury. Picture yourself doing your civic duty as a juror: are you going to trust a person who is routinely chastised for seemingly breaking the rules? What’s done for the sake of efficiency (or to stave off boredom) could have unintended consequences.  The U.S. Department of Justice is starting on the high ground, to some extent, in that prosecutors have been interviewing and coaching their witnesses for months — a level of privilege and access the defense is rarely afforded. Although pre-trial court procedure is meant to level the playing field by having both sides present their arguments and evidence upfront, Enzer noted in many instances the first time a defense attorney speaks to a witness is when they are on the stand.  See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto? | Opinion  Speaking hypothetically, Enzer also mentioned an appeals court could count the number of times the defense was thrown off its line of questioning to determine whether to reverse a decision or call for a retrial. This is in a case, mind you, where the judge has already barred the defense from making a number of planned arguments and where the defendant was essentially told he didn’t necessarily have a right to review every single piece of evidence.  None of this is said to gin up sympathy for Sam Bankman-Fried, who in many respects deserves all that he gets (and then some) and can only blame himself for losing the “court of public opinion.” It’s not his lawyers’ fault SBF decided to go on an ill-advised “apology tour” in a fruitless attempt to regain public sympathy after FTX collapsed. And, hopefully, it wasn’t his lawyers’ fault that SBF was remanded into jail — after leaking a witness’ diary to the press — which has made strategizing and consulting with the defendant that much harder.  SBF is facing an uphill battle because of the magnitude of his alleged crimes and the evidence presented so far. His attorneys have a weak defense because there’s no defensible argument for which SBF was charged. For many, based on what’s already publicly known, there is no reasonable doubt that SBF stole from customers and defrauded investors. And so, because the case is a knockout, it’s hard to take joy in Judge Kaplan making it harder for the defense.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/10/defending-the-indefensible-sam-bankman-frieds-lawyers-deserve-better,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6a2741138911a274c69886a74773c7caed9df5b-874x492.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital’s (3AC) attempt to pursue a $284 million claim against crypto lender BlockFi was put into mediation by the U.S. bankruptcy judge overseeing BlockFi’s case.  Chief Judge Michael Kaplan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of New Jersey set up a mediation window for the two companies’ lawyers to work out a settlement in January, mostly over 3AC’s “preferential payments” to BlockFi.  If the sides can’t work out how much of the amount should be returned to the defunct hedge fund’s own liquidation, Kaplan scheduled a two-day hearing starting on Feb. 5 to allow for arguments over how much money should change hands.  “At issue here are large sums, by all means,” Kaplan said at a hearing Tuesday. “We’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars.”  He expressed concern that the dispute is already pushing the calendar out further than he’d like for desperate creditors and that he is committed to getting it done quickly.  “This is the best I can do,” Kaplan said, saying 3AC’s motion to lift the stay will be postponed until the February hearing.  Preferential payments in a bankruptcy are transactions made just before the bankruptcy filing that potentially gave the recipient a better payout as a creditor than they may have received in court. In this case, 3AC lawyers said Tuesday that the company made as much as $270 million in such payments to BlockFi – more than was previously disclosed.  The dispute over the money is expected to turn upon an answer to a key legal question: When was 3AC actually insolvent, and how does that date relate to when the hedge fund’s payments were made?  Tensions were apparent between the sides in court, as a lawyer for BlockFi said 3AC has a “runaway” legal counsel who is dragging things out and piling up more than $16 million in legal bills. A lawyer for the hedge fund, Adam Goldberg from the firm Latham & Watkins, said those comments were “completely inappropriate and reckless.” He reminded the court that at 3AC “the founders fled and completely ignored any attempt to engage with them,” and those taking down the firm had to rebuild its records, find its assets and secure them for creditors.

18611805,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554772,1696964428,Tether Continues To Flow Into Exchanges: Why This Is Bullish For Bitcoin,"Tether (USDT) has continued to move into exchanges recently. Here’s why this can be a positive development for Bitcoin. Tether Supply On Exchanges Is Now Highest In 7 Months According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, $9.99 billion worth of USDT is now on exchanges. The indicator of relevance here is the “supply on exchanges,” which keeps track of the total amount of a cryptocurrency being stored in all centralized exchanges’ wallets. The interpretation of this metric can differ depending on the type of asset that’s being discussed. In the case of Bitcoin, for example, the exchange reserve may be considered a measure of the potential selling pressure, as one of the reasons investors may deposit the coin is for selling-related purposes. Related Reading: $29,700 Could Be The Next Big Level To Claim For Bitcoin, Here’s Why Thus, the cryptocurrency’s supply on exchanges going up could be a sign that selling is increasing in the sector, and hence, the asset’s price may be heading towards a bearish outcome. In the context of the current discussion, BTC’s supply on exchanges isn’t the one of interest, but rather the metric for Tether is. USDT is a popular stablecoin (the largest one based on market cap) that always has its value pegged to the US Dollar. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the supply of exchanges for Tether over the past few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been going up in recent days | Source: Santiment on X Usually, an investor may want to hold their capital as a stablecoin like USDT to keep it away from the volatility associated with other assets in the cryptocurrency sector. However, many such stablecoin holders use these assets as a temporary safe haven, as they eventually wish to return to the volatile market. When these investors finally find the time to jump back into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, they swap their USDT for them. These traders may use exchanges to make this shift, so a rise in the supply on exchanges of the stablecoin can be a sign that investors are looking to swap into volatile coins. Such buying using Tether can naturally cause a bullish effect on the prices of BTC and others. So, in this way, the exchange supply of the stablecoin can be considered the opposite of the metric for BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes Another Attempt At $28,000, Can Break Happen? The above graph shows that the indicator’s value has increased in the last few weeks. “The $9.99B worth of Tether sitting on exchanges is the highest level of buying power for crypto’s top stablecoin in approximately seven months,” notes Santiment. It should be kept in mind that the rise in the Tether supply on exchanges only implies an increase in the available dry powder. Whether Bitcoin would benefit from a boost depends on whether this dry powder is used to buy the asset or not. BTC Price Bitcoin has declined in the past couple of days as the asset now trades around the $27,600 level.

The company had a strong Q2 2023 performance, generating $81.8 million in revenue while reducing long-term debt by 56% in September 2023. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs could cause a spike in Bitcoin's price and have a major short-term impact on MARA shares. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is back on my radar after a rollercoaster year due to Bitcoin's incredible volatility. MARA shares are currently up 136% YTD and have outperformed the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 by a wide margin. Data by YCharts MARA stock short-squeezed and soared to almost $20 as Bitcoin spiked over $30,000 on hype of several Bitcoin spot ETF applications. However, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has delayed all the current applications, which caused the hype to calm down. I took some profits on MARA around $16 and now believe MARA shares are becoming attractive again under the $10 range. There's a lot going on with Marathon Digital Holdings so let's do a deep dive into the company as we prepare for two major catalysts: the chance for Bitcoin spot ETF approvals and the April 2024 Bitcoin halving. Marathon's Q2 2023 Performance and Elimination of Long-Term Debt Q2 2023 was a decent quarter for Marathon Digital despite lagging Bitcoin prices. The company generated $81.8 million in revenue (Up 314% YoY) and gained $23.4 million from selling Bitcoin to fund operations. Marathon Digital sold 67% of its mined Bitcoin in Q2 2023 while holding the remaining 33% to add to its Bitcoin stack. Marathon Digital Q2 2023 Production (mara.com) Net losses were $21.3 million (-$0.13 per share) compared to $212.6 million (-$1.94 per share) in Q2 2022. It's safe to say that Bitcoin is on a bullish trajectory, as the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event is only 6 months away. The good thing about Bitcoin mining companies is that they provide monthly mining updates to give shareholders and investors deep insight into the company every 30 days. In September 2023 , Marathon Digital earned a record 4.3% share of all Bitcoin rewards. The company produced 1,242 BTC (8,610 BTC produced YTD) and holds 13,726 BTC on its balance sheet. Out of all publicly traded Bitcoin mining stocks, Marathon Digital leads in both monthly BTC production and total BTC holdings on its balance sheet. Publicly Traded Miners with Largest BTC Holdings Company (Ticker) BTC Holdings (As of 10/30/2023) Marathon Digital 13,726 Hut8 (HUT) 9,255 Riot Blockchain (RIOT) 7,327 CleanSpark (CLSK) 2,240 (Source: InvestorTrip.com) The company made another important step in the right direction by eliminating 56% of its debt by converting $417 million worth of 1% 2026 senior convertible notes at a 21% discount into 31 million newly created MARA shares. Marathon now has $471 million in cash on hand (Bitcoin + unrestricted cash) with only $331 million in long-term debt. This is a major milestone for MARA stock, since the company was known for its massive long-term debt and potential bankruptcy risk. MARA shareholders have been diluted by 17% since the newly created shares will increase the total share outstanding to 205 million. However, there is little risk of bankruptcy as the April 2024 Bitcoin halving event approaches soon. The Impact of Bitcoin Spot ETFs Now, let's discuss the biggest short-term impact on MARA shares, as several major institutional investors want to offer Bitcoin to their clients via exchange-traded funds (ETFs). There are currently 11 active Bitcoin spot ETF applications waiting for approval: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Vanguard Bitcoin ETF Trust Ark/21 Shares Bitcoin Trust Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Trust VanEck Bitcoin Trust WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust Franklin Templeton Bitcoin ETF Trust In total, these managers have over $25 trillion in Assets Under Management ((AUM)) which could cause a massive spike in Bitcoin's price if approved. The problem is nobody knows if SEC Chair Gary Gensler will approve these Bitcoin spot ETFs. According to Bitcoin.com , these Bitcoin spot ETFs could get approved in 3 to 6 months. Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval Prediction (bitcoin.com) That means MARA shares could spike heavily in early January if these applications get approved. A spike in Bitcoin's price is extremely bullish for MARA stock since the company mines 41 BTC on average every day plus holds 13,726 BTC on its balance sheet. Short sellers will get crushed after the news because MARA stock has a 25% short interest with over 52 million shares being sold short. Short sellers will be forced to buy back MARA stock to cover their losses, and we could see the beginning of another profitable MARA bull run. Risk Factors Further Share Dilution : Management has increased the total shares outstanding to pay down debt but also wants shareholders to approve a LTIP (Long Term Incentive Plan) to offer more compensation to management. MARA shareholders will vote on November 10th, 2023 to decide whether management may increase the total shares outstanding to reward management for positive stock performance. If approved, I expect MARA shares to fall after November 10th once the news is digested by the market. Bitcoin Spot ETF Rejections : If SEC Chair Gary Gensler fails to approve the Bitcoin spot ETFs, then millions of investors won't be able to purchase Bitcoin safely through a trusted 3rd party before the April 2024 Bitcoin halving. This negative outcome will keep Bitcoin mining stocks from soaring on the positive news. Bitcoin Pre-Halving Dip : Bitcoin usually performs a pre-halving dip in price around 4 months leading up to the Bitcoin halving and could drop in price if history repeats itself. Bitcoin Mining Downtime : Marathon has experienced some downtime due to natural disasters in the past, and something like a hurricane or tornado could disrupt BTC mining production in the short run. My Gameplan for MARA Stock After selling MARA stock for around $16, I was shocked to see MARA shares trading at 50% in just 4 months' time. I've been buying up MARA shares aggressively in anticipation of both the potential for several Bitcoin spot ETF approvals and the April 2024 Bitcoin halving. Options traders may consider opening call options expiring on January 19th (Potential Bitcoin Spot ETF approval play) and April 19th 2024 (Bitcoin Halving play) to profit from the 2 major upcoming events. Be prepared for the pre-halving dip that could send MARA stock falling to around $5 support levels. I'm completely happy holding MARA shares since the company has the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining stash and paid off a large portion of its long-term debt. I plan to vote ""NO"" for the LITP because it dilutes shareholders and doesn't guarantee that management will work any harder for MARA shareholders. Here's a breakdown of the payout structure based on MARA stock performance in comparison to its peers: Marathon Digital LITP (sec.gov) MARA shares have underperformed its 3 biggest competitors over the last 52 weeks. Data by YCharts Despite its underperformance, I'm thrilled to see Marathon Digital's debt shrink and am more bullish than ever on the company's long-term prospects.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4640006-marathon-digital-buy-before-bitcoin-spot-etfs-potential-approval?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18608705.jpeg

Historically, November has always been significant for the cryptocurrency market, as BTC usually gains value, affecting other coins. According to crypto analyst Miles Deutscher, November promises to be a pivotal month for Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors. Related Reading: What’s Behind XRP Price Retreat? Assessing Some Eye-Opening Metrics Bitcoin’s Ongoing Sideways Trend Hints At Potential Bullish Shift In November Market experts suggest that Bitcoin’s stagnant price movement might transition to a bullish trend in November. According to them, this could occur if it behaves similarly to past cycles before a halving event. For instance, on October 10, cryptocurrency analyst Miles Deutscher referenced a chart from CryptoCon. In the X post, Miles highlighted the parallels between Bitcoin’s recent patterns and those observed in earlier cycles. #Bitcoin’s recent price action is still mirroring the last 2 cycles. This is typical sideways price action that occurs from Q2-Q4 in pre-halving years. November 21st has historically been the key pivot point for a bullish shift. Will be interesting to see how $BTC responds. pic.twitter.com/zP9vlG31Qc — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) October 10, 2023 He added that around November 21, the price of Bitcoin usually starts going up a lot, getting ready for the next halving event. This date holds significance as a turning point in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. For instance, in 2015, when Bitcoin’s price was ranging for about six months, it began to go up in November. Similarly, in 2019, the price of Bitcoin didn’t change much for most of the year, but then it started to increase towards the end of the year. Other Crypto Analyst Predicts Similar Price Projections Another prominent crypto trader and analyst, Mags, noticed something interesting in Bitcoin’s chart. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s price is about 60% lower than the highest price it ever reached. This happened around 200 days before its previous halving, just like in 2015 and 2019. The analyst wrote: In 2016, BTC was -65% below its ATH. In 2019, BTC was -60% below its ATH. In 2023, BTC is currently -60% below its ATH. So, even if it seems like Bitcoin’s price isn’t moving much, it’s following a similar pattern to previous cycles. Another crypto analyst, Galaxy Trading, posited a similar prediction for Bitcoin’s price move. The analyst drew attention to 2018-2019 when Bitcoin’s price hit a significant bottom. He noted that Bitcoin could dump or bottom around Nov 10-15 this year if we see a similar price move. Additionally, lead researcher at Matrixport, Markus Thielen, said that Bitcoin’s price might go up massively by the end of 2024. However, he thinks it will happen for different reasons than what we’re seeing now. He drew attention to some critical areas in August 2012, December 2015, May 2019, and August 2020. According to him, the bullish market commenced within 12 to 18 months in each case. However, the Bitcoin halving is around six months away and might occur in late April or May, depending on your countdown timer.

42392342,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5UuB,1696956643,"Israeli Crypto Firms Scramble to Deal With War, in Between the Sirens","Ben Samocha, the CEO of CryptoJungle, an Israeli crypto educational resource, was on his way Tuesday to the funeral of one of his students, who had been killed, among 260 other young folks, in an attack by Hamas terrorists at a music festival near the Gaza border on Saturday.  He was trying to squeeze in an interview with CoinDesk, but the plan kept getting interrupted by sirens of rocket warnings on the road.  Samocha is among Israeli crypto-industry workers who are suddenly scrambling to deal with a crisis of a magnitude they haven’t witnessed in recent memory. He’s helped to organize an aid campaign to raise crypto donations, while dealing with the repercussions of the Israel-Hamas war, and trying to stay optimistic.  “I'm sure that we as a country, we as a people and we as a company will be able to get back on our feet and get back to normal,” Samocha said. “Crypto is here to stay, blockchain is here to stay and we will need education, we will need content and we will be here to provide it.”  Several crypto executives and developers in the country told CoinDesk they weren’t experiencing severe business disruptions – many of them are working remotely. They were mainly dealing with the personal elements of the attack such as the stress and annoyances of bare supermarket shelves and responding to security scares.  “We're very aware that even in this unimaginable period, life needs to continue,” said Guy Itzhaki, CEO and co-founder of Fhenix, an upcoming blockchain that will bring homomorphic encryption to smart contracts.  Jolt to Security  On Saturday, Israelis woke up to a reality they thought they were familiar with: the sounds of alarms to take cover from rockets entering their skies. Quickly, social media showed that this round of fighting seemed different.  Shortly thereafter, Israel entered a war with Hamas, nearly 50 years to the day since the last time the country experienced a surprise attack at such a scale. Over 1,000 Israelis have died since Saturday, with 2,500 people injured, according to local media, and over 100 children, women and elderly Israelis have been kidnapped and taken to Gaza.  The war has not only deeply affected the collective psyche of the nation, but the day-to-day operations and the employees of Israeli crypto companies have also been stalled.  The country, known sometimes as the “Start-up Nation,” has an economy where tech jobs compromise about 14% of the workforce.  One of the largest projects so far to come out of the disaster is Crypto Aid Israel, a campaign led by many Israeli crypto firms which accepts crypto donations to help citizens who have been affected or displaced by the ongoing war.  Samocha helped to organize the campaign along with his chief operating officer Tal Mor, and the effort has raised roughly $85,000 in the 24 hours since its launch on Monday. Samocha said his employees at CryptoJungle are all taking part in the campaign.  The local media outlet Calcalist reported Tuesday that Israeli police have frozen cryptocurrency accounts linked to Hamas.  Donating blood  Many crypto firms are helping to organize volunteer activities, like preparing food or clothing for those who need it, so that companies can collect or go together as a team to support those most affected by the violence.  Asaf Nadler, co-founder of Addressable, which helps Web3 marketers engage with audiences despite anonymity, said that half of his employees are volunteering to help out, “either donating blood or helping get clothes or food, people are deeply involved in that as a company.”  Crypto firms remain mostly open, but have made plans to adjust to reshuffling of employees.  Several crypto executives told CoinDesk that employees had been called up to reserve duties in the army; others are allowing employees time to partake in volunteering, or to support relatives affected by the violence.  “No one is really expecting employees to really work right now, or to be like 100%,” Tal Shalom, a partner at Collider Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in Israeli Web3 companies, told CoinDesk.  “Companies focusing right now are preparing themselves for different scenarios, like working fully remote or operating from different sites in case they're not able to go into the office,” Shalom added.  'Glad to be working'  Other companies have also said that showing up for work may give some employees a welcome escape from the harsh reality of the news headlines.  Itzhaki of Fhenix told CoinDesk that his company wants to “give them this opportunity to actually work, because working for me is one of the things that you can do that would actually take your mind off everything that's happening.”  One crypto analyst based in the West Bank said he works from home and hasn't been too affected other than the distraction of their kids being around, since school has been suspended. The person, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said the neighborhood had a scare on Monday after a report that there might be a terrorist in the city; someone apparently breached the nearby security outpost and left some burning tires.  The analyst and family members locked themselves in rooms in their house for about two hours, until an all-clear signal was given. Supermarkets are mostly out of bread, eggs, milk and produce, apparently due to supply-chain disruptions as well as hoarding.  ""Honestly I'm glad to be working,"" the person said. ""It keeps my mind off things.""  Nadler of Addressable said he is supporting employees who lost relatives from the music festival.  “It's horrifying. It's really horrifying,” Nadler said. “So, in such cases, it's about asking them: Can I do anything for you? Can we be there by our side? It's the part in which you go from being a business to being a supportive family.”  Bradley Keoun contributed reporting to this story.

42392356,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5Vtj,1696956387,Star Witness Caroline Ellison Says Sam Bankman-Fried Directed Her to Commit Fraud,"NEW YORK – Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, testified that she committed fraud at the direction of her ex-boyfriend and former colleague, FTX exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried.  Ellison, 28, is the government’s highly anticipated star witness in the six-week trial of Bankman-Fried. She was the CEO of Alameda Research, the hedge fund prosecutors say stole billions of dollars from customers of its sister company, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. (Read the government’s indictment here.)  Prosecutors began their questioning of Ellison by asking her if she committed crimes and if so, who she committed them with.  Ellison, who pleaded guilty to fraudand conspiracy charges last year, said she had, and that she had committed them at the direction of Bankman-Fried.  “I sent balance sheets at the direction of Sam that made Alameda’s balances look less risky to investors,” she said, also testifying Alameda had taken funds from FTX to make its own investments.  Her proximity to Bankman-Fried’s business and personal lives is almost certain to give the jury its closest look yet at the decision-making that led to FTX’s epic collapse last November. She has been cooperating with the government since at least December, when she pleaded guilty to an array of financial crimes stemming from her time at Alameda.  Borrowing from FTX customers  Ellison also spoke about Alameda’s borrowing FTX customers’ funds.  Bankman-Fried “said to use [FTX funds] but to keep money on FTX” to meet customer withdrawal requests, she said.  A lot of this money went to loans made to members of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle, with funds going toward “investments and political donations,” Ellison said.  According to Ellison, Bankman-Fried thought the political donation strategy was “highly effective,” offering “very high returns in terms of [political] influence” at a modest cost.  But “I didn’t feel good about it,” she said of the loans made to insiders. “It might look like Alameda sort of … funneling money to FTX executives.”  As for her on-and-off romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried, Ellison said: “It created some awkward situations.”  SBF in charge  Ellison testified that she reported to Bankman-Fried even after being appointed CEO of Alameda Research, despite the appearance that Bankman-Fried was stepping back from the hedge fund he started to focus on running the FTX exchange.  “I would always ultimately defer to Sam,” she testified.  She said she had no equity in Alameda despite asking for it. Bankman-Fried decided it would be “too complicated and didn’t make sense” for her to get a stake in the hedge fund, though she did have a sliver of equity in FTX.  “He thought it was important to separate Alameda and FTX more optically,” Ellison said of Bankman-Fried.  Ellison also spoke about the “essentially unlimited” line of credit Alameda had at FTX. Bankman-Fried “was the one who set up these systems,” she said.  Borrowing from Genesis, pledging FTT  A big part of Ellison’s testimony focused on Bankman-Fried’s desire to secure loans for Alameda.  “Sam was directing us to borrow as much money as possible,” she said. “This is something he talked about a lot.”  Her testimony shed new light on why FTX’s exchange token, FTT, made up such a large portion of the Alameda balance sheet CoinDesk obtained last November, an award-winning scoop that set off the unraveling of Bankman-Fried’s empire.  “Sam had said that he wanted to buy more [FTT] ... because he didn’t want to put any of our loans in danger,” Ellison said Tuesday. “It was a little potentially misleading to put [the FTT tokens] on” the balance sheet.  One scenario management worried about was that lenders such as Genesis would cease to accept FTT as collateral, Ellison said.  “We were borrowing billions of dollars from Genesis using FTT as collateral on our loans,” she said. (Genesis, a trading business that has since ceased trading, was a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  Testing the judge’s patience, again  Like last week, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers appeared to wear on Judge Lewis Kaplan’s patience as they continued to raise objections throughout Ellison’s testimony.  “What is the objection?” Judge Kaplan asked the defense at one point.  “This is supposed to be [a] direct examination, your honor,” one of Bankman-Fried’s lawyers answered.  “Overruled,” the judge said.  On Wednesday, Bankman-Fried’s defense team will likely cross-examine Ellison with an eye toward discrediting her. In his opening argument last week, lead lawyer Mark Cohen said Ellison ignored instructions from Bankman-Fried to place hedges on Alameda’s trading that could have staunched some of its bleeding.  The excitement around Ellison’s testimony was palpable in the press corps. Reporters began arriving at the Daniel P. Moynihan federal courthouse well before sunrise for a chance to see Ellison in person.  Gary Wang, continued  Ellison took the stand Tuesday immediately following testimony from fellow insider Gary Wang, the quiet coder who last week told the court he wrote much of the programming that enabled FTX’s fraud.  Defense attorney Christian Everdell opened Tuesday’s proceedings by continuing his cross-examination of Wang, asking a number of questions about what happened in November 2022, the month FTX collapsed, and his subsequent conversations with prosecutors.  Everdell also hinted at a potential defense strategy, asking about Ellison’s decision not to hedge Alameda’s positions.  “It was [Ellison’s] decision not to hedge, right?” he asked.  “[Ellison] was the CEO,” Wang said. “I don’t know who made the decision.”  One area of interest was Wang saying he signed a number of promissory notes for loans worth tens of millions of dollars from Alameda.  Judge Lewis Kaplan asked what the $35 million in one loan was for. Wang said it was for a company Bankman-Fried wanted to invest in.  The judge followed up, asking if there were occasions where Bankman-Fried wanted to invest in companies but had someone else do it.  “Sam said something about not wanting this to come directly,” Wang said, before cutting himself off briefly.

The cryptocurrency’s price has retraced below this critical level, raising concerns of accelerated selling momentum that could potentially drive ADA toward the multi-month support level at $0.2. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, the current ADA price stands at $0.249, reflecting a 2.1% decline over the past 24 hours and a 3.5% dip in the last seven days. According to a price analysis report, ADA could experience a further 5.5% loss before finding support at the next significant level of $0.24. This downturn follows a noteworthy upturn observed toward the end of September when ADA surged by 12% from its base at $0.24. However, the recent geopolitical tensions stemming from the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Middle East have draped an ominous cloud over the world of finance. Like an unexpected thunderstorm on a sunny day, these tensions have caught investors off guard, leading to a profound dip in both stock and cryptocurrency markets.

The unexpected decrease has left the crypto community anxious about the stability of the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency and the long-term effects of the decline. Ethereum Price Drops After Large-Scale Ether Swap On Monday, October 9, the price of Ethereum declined following an extensive Ether swap by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit community-run organization dedicated to enabling better human coordination. Related Reading: These Bullish Factors Prove XRP Price Rally Is Not Over Yet The Ether transaction which took place on Uniswap, a decentralized crypto exchange platform, saw the ETH price drop 5% from its daily high of $1,635 to a local low of $1,553 before recovering once more. According to Arkham data, the Ethereum Foundation swapped approximately 1,700 ETH worth $2.7 million to a single wallet address which contained almost $400,000 worth of cryptocurrencies and was titled ‘Grant Provider’ by Etherscan. The specific intentions behind the large-scale swap have not been disclosed by the Ethereum Foundation. However, the Ethereum Foundation, an organization that holds a considerable influential position, regularly swaps large amounts of tokens to fund its operations. Presently, Ethereum is trading at a price value of 1589.36 after recovering from the initial decline. The steep decline has left the crypto community worried about the health of the cryptocurrency and whether the price of Ethereum would recover. ETH price recovers after 5% decline | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com ETH Whales Dump $8.5 Billion The Ethereum Foundation has not been the only large wallet to sell in recent times as other ETH whales have taken advantage of the altcoin’s price. According to crypto analyst Ali Charts on X, ETH whales dumped a whopping $8.5 billion worth of tokens. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Presents Data To Prove That XRP Is Deflationary This large selling started in February this year and has continued into October. As a result, the whale selling has seen over 5 million ETH sold and redistributed over this 8-month period. The analyst also points out that “this selling trend continues with no current indication of a shift towards #ETH accumulation yet.” ETH whales dump 5 million tokens | Source: X Compared to its all-time high of $4891.70 in 2021, the price of ETH has dropped by more than half and has been struggling to reclaim the $2,000 mark. However, this could present a unique buying opportunity for investors who could see the price decline as ETH being on discount. Nevertheless, Ethereum continues to hold its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market with a market cap of $191.5 billion at the time of writing. Over the last day, the altcoin has also seen some recovery, rising to $1,593 as bulls gear up to retest the $1,600 resistance.

The regime requires crypto firms to be registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to be able to approve their own promos and ads – but allows crypto firms that are not registered to have their ads approved by authorized firms.  Binance, which is not registered with the FCA, said it was complying with the new regime by partnering with Rebuildingsociety.com to have it approve communications for the crypto firm.  But on Tuesday, the FCA posted an alert saying Rebuildingsociety.com cannot approve crypto ads for firms and should ""withdraw any existing approvals for crypto promotions."" The firm has till Friday to tell the FCA that it has completed the necessary steps in writing.  ""The FCA can impose requirements on a firm in circumstances where it concludes that it is necessary to do so to advance one or more of the FCA's operational objectives, which includes securing an appropriate degree of consumer protection,"" it said in a post.  While Binance declined to comment on the restrictions placed on its U.K. partner, a spokesperson for the exchange told CoinDesk that it had shared its partnership agreement with the FCA on Oct. 2, ""almost a full week before the requirements of the updated Financial Promotions Regime came into effect.""  While the FCA declined to comment further on the matter, it said in a late Tuesday post that if ""unregistered crypto asset firms’ promotions"" are no longer approved by an authorized firm, ""they must cease promoting crypto assets to U.K. consumers until such time as they can find an authorized firm to approve their financial promotions.""

18601121,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554785,1696946411,Shiba Inu Price Dips Below Key Support: Time To Enter Or Exit SHIB?,"The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price currently treads on crucial technical terrains. As highlighted in previous comprehensive analysis, the potential impacts of two distinct chart patterns were observed on the 1-week timeframe for SHIB, both leading to vastly different price trajectories. The 1-week chart reveals a compelling quadruple bottom formation for SHIB. If this pattern materializes, it could suggest a bullish surge of up to 250% from its breakout point, as delineated in prior assessments. Conversely, a starkly contrasting pattern emerges in the form of a descending triangle, which has taken shape over a span of 60 weeks. A conclusive break below its defining neckline could induce substantial declines in SHIB’s valuation. Shiba Inu Price: Currently, the bearish sentiment around Shiba Inu seems to be intensifying in the wake of the crypto market downturn. With SHIB recording a price of $0.00000695 at the press time and briefly touching a low of $0.00000674 yesterday, it has breached the descending triangle’s neckline pegged at $0.00000715. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Stagnation: What’s Causing Meme Coin’s Recent Sluggishness? Should SHIB close this week below this key support level, it might portend strong bearish implications, possibly steering the price toward its annual low of $0.000006. Yet, a closure below $0.00000715, while foreboding, is not conclusively bearish. An analogous dip occurred in June, which was swiftly followed by a robust rally. Over an 8-week period, SHIB ascended by 59%, only to face resistance at the 50-day EMA of $0.00001140, leading to a renewed breach under the descending triangle’s trend line on the weekly chart. At this juncture, if SHIB can secure a weekly close above the $0.00000715 mark either this week or the next, it might bolster the case for the bullish quadruple bottom setup. So SHIB could see a similar rally to June this year. From a technical viewpoint, the cryptocurrency will then confront key resistance barriers: the 20-day EMA at $0.00000806, the descending triangle’s trendline approximately at $0.000009, and the 50-day EMA at $0.00001019. Subsequently, a monumental target, pinpointed at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.00002545, representing a rally in excess of 250%, could be attainable. Related Reading: Shiba Inu-Based BONE Gearing Up For Massive Rally, Here’s Why When interpreting these patterns, investors must decide whether the quadruple bottom or the descending triangle holds more weight for them, making it a buy or sell position. Community Insights In a recent post on X (previously known as Twitter), prominent SHIB influencer, Lucie, urged the Shiba Inu community to persevere: “In these turbulent times, it’s imperative for us to remain resilient. The crypto landscape is indeed tumultuous, inundated with unsettling global updates. However, as the formidable ShibArmy, our collective endeavours will undoubtedly yield dividends. Let’s remain united, weathering challenges and championing our shared vision.” Investors and traders are encouraged to exercise caution and conduct due diligence, keeping a close watch on the unfolding SHIB price narrative.

42392353,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5VjT,1696944600,Key Points From the Sam Bankman-Fried Trial's First Week,"Every morning last week, I’ve gotten up at an uncomfortable hour, trekked over to the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan and watched the U.S. Department of Justice’s case against Sam Bankman-Fried begin. Here’s what’s happened so far.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  ‘Did you commit crimes?’  The narrative  It’s been less than a week since the federal government’s trial against FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried began, but we’ve already heard from an FTX co-founder, a former developer, a customer and an investor.  Why it matters  The trial continues!  Breaking it down  Over the first three days of the actual trial (day one was just dedicated to jury selection) we’ve heard opening arguments and testimony from four people: FTX customer Marc-Antoine Julliard, former FTX developer Adam Yedidia, Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang and FTX co-founder Gary Wang.  Each of these witnesses brought their own unique story of how they were harmed by FTX (and by proxy, Bankman-Fried, per the DOJ) and the exchange’s collapse. Here’s a list of key revelations we’ve heard.  Gary Wang – who’s previously pleaded guilty to similar charges to what Bankman-Fried faces – testified that Bankman-Fried directed him to write code allowing Alameda Research to have a negative balance on FTX as far back as July 2019.  Ultimately Alameda took and spent at least $8 billion of FTX customers’ money, Wang said.  Wang opened by saying he committed crimes, did so with Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison and Nishad Singh and that he was hoping for no jail time as a result of his cooperation.  FTX had an insurance fund with an amount listed on its website, but this amount was essentially a randomly generated figure, Wang said.  For a while, FTX executives didn’t actually know how much Alameda owed its customers because of a software bug, Adam Yedidia said. The bug overstated the amount owed by $8 billion (essentially twice the real amount).  Alameda used FTX customer deposits to pay back its lenders, Yedidia said. Wang later confirmed that Alameda had returned lenders’ funds and that these funds “came from FTX customers.”  FTX presented itself as a safe custodian to investors like Paradigm, Matt Huang said.  Similarly, Bankman-Fried told Paradigm that Alameda had no preferential treatment, Huang said. Wang later said Alameda did receive special treatment (see point 1).  At no point did Bankman-Fried or anyone at FTX tell Paradigm that Alameda was exempt from its auto-liquidation feature, Huang said.  Paradigm has marked its $278 million investment in FTX to zero, Huang said.  Reminder: You can read all of our ongoing coverage at CoinDesk, and get daily updates on the trial through our SBF Trial newsletter.  Stories you may have missed  Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison to Testify Tuesday in Sam Bankman-Fried Trial: Here’s the latest from the courthouse.  Crypto Needs Congress, But U.S. Lawmakers Have Opted for Pandemonium: Like a month ago there was hope for progress on crypto regulation issues in the House of Representatives. But last week, now-former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) lost a motion to vacate. House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) is the speaker pro tempore and a vote for a new speaker is (as of the time of writing this) set for Wednesday.  SEC’s Motion to Appeal Loss in Ripple Case Is Denied: As sometimes happens with headlines, this one is a bit more nuanced than at first blush: The SEC can’t file an interlocutory appeal, meaning it can’t appeal a judge’s decision amid its ongoing case against Ripple or halt the proceedings in the meantime, but we may still see an appeal later on.  Why Some Crypto Firms Are Suspending Services in the U.K.: The U.K.’s crypto promotions rule is now in effect – and it is certainly having an effect.  This week  Tuesday  13:30 UTC (9:30 a.m. EDT) Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial resumes.  15:00 UTC (11:00 a.m. EDT) There will be a hearing in BlockFi’s ongoing bankruptcy case.  Elsewhere:  (Wired) Wired’s Andy Greenberg dug into last year’s FTX hack, which remains one of the still-to-be-explained events from the FTX collapse.  (Bloomberg) Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky’s criminal trial is scheduled for Sept. 17, 2024. He’s charged with securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to manipulate the CEL token’s price, scheming to manipulate CEL’s price, market manipulation (for CEL) and wire fraud tied to CEL price manipulation. Part of the defensive strategy seems to be to argue over whether CEL really was a security or not.

This period of consolidation has been marked by daily charts adorned with short-bodied candlesticks, a visual testament to the lack of enthusiasm from both buyers and sellers. It’s a curious phase in the world of DOGE, where the price appears to be biding its time, awaiting a catalyst to break free from this stasis. However, recent market fluctuations have cast a shadow over this tranquility, pushing DOGE closer to a foundational support level, possibly signaling an impending bullish resurgence. Related Reading: What’s Behind XRP Price Retreat? Assessing Some Eye-Opening Metrics Dogecoin Price Analysis Suggests Sideways Movement Recent price analysis indicates that DOGE’s sideways trend may continue, with the coin hovering near the $0.055 support level within a downsloping trendline. This level, coinciding with a long-standing support trendline, forms a significant accumulation zone. While DOGE’s price currently stands at approximately $0.059099 according to CoinGecko, it has experienced a 2.6% decline over the past 24 hours and a 4.9% dip over the last seven days. Should the resistance trendline maintain its influence, DOGE holders may anticipate a potential 7% drop, which could lead to a retest of the year-long support trendline located around the $0.055 region. DOGE market cap reaching the $8.3 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com Influential Figures Debate Crypto’s Inherent Value Meanwhile, on the social media platform X, a lively debate unfolded as two influential figures shared their perspectives on a contentious topic. The discussion was ignited by a statement from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the Coinbase case, where they asserted that “crypto has ‘no innate or inherent value.'” This assertion did not go unnoticed by Dogecoin’s co-founder, Billy Markus, who responded with a pointed critique, emphasizing the taxes he had paid on his cryptocurrency earnings. then return all the taxes y’all made me pay for receiving it you horrific evil hypocrites pic.twitter.com/rwisnADwLe — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) October 9, 2023 Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, renowned for his influential stance on cryptocurrencies, also entered the conversation, offering support to Markus’s perspective. Musk challenged the regulatory body by posing a rhetorical question: “It’s real if you have to pay taxes, but otherwise not real?” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Stagnation: What’s Causing Meme Coin’s Recent Sluggishness?

42392355,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5Vob,1696941313,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Dominance Continues to Climb,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The Bitcoin market dominance rate, which tracks the largest cryptocurrency's share of the total digital asset market, rose to 51.2% on Tuesday, near a 26-month high of 52% reached at the end of June. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has gained 66% year to date, compared with the second largest cryptocurrency by market value, ether, which has gained 32%. According to LMAX Digital, ether’s underperformance against bitcoin is due to ether’s recent “healthy increase” in ether supply over the past month. LMAX also notes that “decreased transaction activity on Ethereum means less ether being burned, which has translated to an increase in the overall supply,” as a contributing factor to ether’s underperformance.  Bitstamp, the longest-running cryptocurrency exchange, says it’s in talks to help three large European banks begin offering crypto services around the first quarter of next year. The news, revealed by a senior executive during an interview with CoinDesk, suggests the European Union’s major crypto regulatory effort, called Markets in Crypto Assets, or MiCA, is easing the way for conventional financial firms to get into digital assets. That’s a stark contrast with the U.S., where regulators are cracking down, thus keeping old-school firms hesitant and forcing crypto companies to consider moving elsewhere.  Lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried want to quiz FTX co-founder Gary Wang about his reliance on legal advice when agreeing to a series of loans from linked hedge fund Alameda Research, according to a legal filing made late Monday night. The letter, sent as Bankman-Fried’s trial enters its second week, seeks carve-outs from a judge who’s previously proved reluctant to let the crypto tycoon blame the alleged fraud on his lawyers. Prosecutors have already probed Wang about the $200 million- $300 million loan he received from Alameda, which he used to make venture investments and buy himself a house in the Bahamas.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows market-implied probabilities for the Fed funds rate over different time frames.  The market is currently assigning just 10% probability of the Fed raising rates by 25 basis points to the 5.5%-5.75% range.  On Monday, top Fed officials said that rising yields on longer duration government bonds could keep the central bank from raising rates.

18596453,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554796,1696938314,Why Does Ripple Return Unlocked Tokens To Escrow? Pro-XRP Lawyer Provides Answers,"Ripple usually returns a substantial part of its unlocked XRP tokens following every monthly release of 1 billion tokens from its escrow system. Justifying this move, pro-XRP legal expert Bill Morgan explained why Ripple does this rather than leaving these tokens in circulation. Why Ripple Returns Some XRP Tokens To Escrow In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Morgan suggested that Ripple’s decision not to sell most of the XRP released each month is one of the steps the firm takes to “support XRP’s price.” Morgan is likely referring to the fact Ripple selling all the 1 billion tokens could significantly affect (in a negative manner) the token’s price. Related Reading: These Bullish Factors Prove XRP Price Rally Is Not Over Yet Morgan’s tweet came in response to another X user (Alter Diego), who suggested that Ripple wasn’t relocking those tokens of its own volition but because there was no demand for them. He mentioned that the crypto company’s inability to sell “even half of its monthly XRP escrow release” despite gaining clarity says a lot about the coin. The fact that Ripple doesn’t manage to sell even half of its monthly $XRP escrow release even after “having gained clarity” should tell you everything you need to know about this coin. — Alter Diego (@elalterdiego) October 9, 2023 Another member of the XRP community noted that Ripple could sell all the tokens from its monthly release, and if they did, people like Diego would still complain that “they were dumping.” Meanwhile, he stated that most XRP sales from Ripple were made to “support the rails for new ODL networks which have to be primed.” Diego’s claims that there is little or no demand for XRP seem unfounded, as XRP sales have jumped this year. Meanwhile, institutional investors seem to be taking a greater interest in the token as institutional inflows into the the token continue to spike. Token price falls to $0.49 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Ripple Has Lost Most Of Its Gains From ‘Second Victory’ In a prior tweet to the one where he explained why Ripple relocks its escrowed XRP tokens, Morgan noted that the token had lost most of its gains from Judge Analisa Torres’ denial of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) motion for an interlocutory appeal. Related Reading: 39-Month Cycle Says XRP Price Is Poised For Breakout To $1,000, Here’s When XRP had climbed as high as $0.6 following Judge Torres’ order. However, the token has dropped by over 2% since then to $0.49. However, despite the decline, many in the community are choosing to remain positive. One particular X user (who happens to be a software developer) noted that XRP’s price wasn’t solely dependent on the court’s decision as its price “will go where the market takes it.” Irrespective, the user believes that the token’s value is growing as the network’s developers continue to build “incredible things daily.” Featured image from American Banker, chart from Tradingview.com",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | ICO | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-return-xrp-tokens-escrow/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/18596453.jpeg

42392349,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5VJp,1696938143,Bitcoin Could Fall as Market Braces for Spread of Israeli-Hamas War,"The effects of the war in the Middle East could spill over to the crypto markets and cause a short-term decline in riskier assets such as bitcoin (BTC), several traders who spoke to CoinDesk opined.  The conflict extended to its fourth day on Tuesday following Hamas' surprise weekend attack into southern Israeli towns. The war's death toll has neared 1,600 on both sides, according to the Associated Press.  “The global market worries that the conflict will spread to nearby oil-producing countries so investors are still relatively sensitive,” said Greta Yuan, head of research at digital assets platform VDX, in an email to CoinDesk. “As the geopolitics of the Middle East worsened over the weekend and market risk-averse sentiment increased, as a result, spot gold rose by nearly 1%.”  Crypto markets had earlier slumped 2% on Monday as traders priced in rising oil prices and a drop in traditional equities as the turmoil could impact international trade.  Futures traders betting on higher prices saw over $100 million in liquidations over a 24-hour period from Monday, as alternative currencies saw a sell-off. However, crypto markets are showing signs of early resilience that may instill confidence among bulls.  “Currently, we've observed a temporary dip in Bitcoin's price following the shocking news of the conflict, but the price has already stabilized,” noted Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of crypto exchange BTSE. “Crypto assets have shown resilience in the face of rising geopolitical turmoil in the past.”  “For instance, when the U.S. imposed sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we saw a sharp rebound in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market - that was in March last year,” Mei added.  In early 2022, military tensions between Russia and Ukraine saw bitcoin shed as much as 7% in a single day, displaying the significance and impact of geopolitical struggles on the niche asset class. At such times, typically, investors tend to flee to gold, while assets deemed riskier tend to see declines.  Meanwhile, some traders say investors should keep an eye out for oil and energy market changes for now to gain a sense of where bitcoin may be headed.  “Regarding macroeconomic implications, should the risks of expansion and conflict escalation materialize, we must keep an eye on energy prices again,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a message to CoinDesk. “Rising oil prices are triggering a wave of sell-off in equities, fuelling expectations of tighter monetary policy. And that's the most considerable risk to assets like Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole.”  “However, if we see a quick return to some form of normalcy, that would be a positive for cryptocurrencies. But for now, that looks like a less likely scenario,” Kuptsikevich said, adding that, for now, the chances of appetite for equities and cryptocurrencies to shrink was higher compared to the past weeks.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/10/bitcoin-could-fall-due-to-israel-hamas-tensions-traders-worry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e0c0e104e0e136b4ea10fd7b0d067ecca5c087f-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18593852,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554755,1696933835,Bitcoin And Crypto Poised To Skyrocket As Endgame Of US Policy Nears: Analyst,"The intricacies of US monetary policy have been placed under the microscope by Jordi Alexander, CIO of Selini Capital, who today offered an incisive analysis of the potential ripple effects these policies may have on the Bitcoin and crypto market. Drawing correlations between traditional financial mechanisms and the nascent digital asset landscape, his commentary elucidates a series of complex market dynamics that every investor should be aware of. At the crux of Alexander’s argument is his observation that the Federal Reserve’s approach to handling current economic conditions might be nearing an inflection point. As reported by NewsBTC, there are growing concerns in the bond market. Bonds with maturities exceeding 10 years have seen a decline of 46% from their highest value in March 2020. Moreover, the 30-year bonds have fared even more poorly, with a drop of 53%. Alexander remarked, “Haven’t expressed macro views in a while – but as things are about to really start moving – its time. I spent months analyzing the endgame of US policy. The outcome I saw is now coming into view. Gradually at first.. then all at once, the Fed will poo-poo in their pampers. ” Why QE Might Be Back Sooner Than Later The analyst perceives the recent shifts in the bond market, especially concerning long-term bonds, as a precursor to potential policy changes. To back this up, Alexander is referencing Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal who recently highlighted a specific sentiment from the Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan that is indicative of this shift. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trader Shares The “Only Chart” You Need To Profit From BTC In 2024 Logan has begun to express reservations about the earlier hawkish stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), largely due to the recent surges in Treasury yields and term premiums. Her concerns emphasize the tug-of-war between the need for restrictive financial conditions to bring inflation down and the current strength of the labor market and overall economic output. Remarkably, Logan believes that the reasons for the tightening of financial conditions, especially those connected with the recent surges in Treasury yields and term premiums, might reduce the necessity to raise the fed funds rate. Commenting on this U-turn by the Fed’s Logan, Alexander argues, “This is the Bat-Signal I have been waiting for. What does it mean? Why is the Dallas Fed president in the top tweet doing a big baby U-turn? Because they are starting to realize they are losing control of the bond market!” Expanding on the nuances of the bond market, Alexander emphasized the distinction between the front and back ends of the curve. He stated, “The front of the curve, such as T-bills & 2-year bonds, are generally very responsive to rate guidance by the Fed… But the Fed never has as good control over the back end- especially 30-year bonds.” Alexander’s analysis points towards a decelerating demand for these long-term bonds, suggesting a potential loss of market control by the Federal Reserve. This evolving bond market scenario places the Federal Reserve in a precarious situation. Alexander, elaborating on this potential dilemma, posits, “What if they agree to stop raising rates or even initiate cuts, but bond buyers still don’t show up?” He further speculated on a possible shift – the endgame – in the Federal Reserve’s approach: “Placed between a rock and a hard place, the Fed might be pushed towards Yield Curve Control,” hinting at a reversion to Quantitative Easing (QE) policies. Related Reading: Binance CEO Foresees Monumental Bitcoin Price Shift Following Halving Drawing a parallel to the Japanese financial scenario, Alexander prophesied, “The USD could very well be the casualty of this policy direction, much like the Yen’s predicament in Japan.” He then connected these macroeconomic shifts to the digital asset space, forecasting, “Goodbye Quantitative Tightening, hello my old friend Mr. QE. The timeline is uncertain, but it is time to start paying attention to term premium, like the Dallas Fed!” Bitcoin And Crypto Could Profit Massively Ultimately, QE is something that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have benefited tremendously from in the last bull market. Alexander therefore also predicts “yes your internet coins [aka Bitcoin and crypto] could then benefit”. Remarkably, this view is shared by several analysts. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes recently expressed a similar view, according to which the Fed will sooner than later find itself in a bind to reintroduce QE. Hayes predicts a Bitcoin price of $750,000 in 2026. But this perspective isn’t universally accepted. Yuga.eth from Coinbase drew on Austan Goolsbee’s confidence in the FOMC’s commitment to tackling inflation. To this, Alexander sharply responded, “Nothing about increasing the debt is helping the inflation anyway. As I wrote at the very beginning, the only way to do it properly would be to increase taxes, especially corporate.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $26,677.

42392351,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5VU5,1696933766,Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Drops to 15-Month Low as ETFs Fail to Uplift Sentiment,"Investors continue to prefer ether over bitcoin in a high interest rate environment.  Top two ether futures ETFs listed last week register dismal volumes, per Kaiko.  The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio continues to lose ground amid the lack of meaningful demand for the recently launched futures-based ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  ETH/BTC fell to 0.05675 late Monday, reaching the lowest since July 2022, according to charting platform TradingView. The ratio has declined by nearly 30% since Ethereum implemented Merge in mid-September last year.  As many as six ether futures ETFs went live in the U.S. last week, opening doors for traders looking to take exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency without owning it.  The early response has been tepid, with the big two - VanECK's EFUT and ProShares EETH - registering an average daily trading volume of $5 million in the first week, according to Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko.  That's a far cry from ProShares Bitcoin Strategy's (BITO) first-day trading volume of $1 billion. ProShares bitcoin futures ETF debuted at the height of the crypto bull run in October 2021. Since then, the crypto market has taken a beating, with higher interest rates worldwide taking the wind out of the unprecedented risk-taking seen after the coronavirus-induced crash of 2020.  Per Kaiko, the bear market could be responsible for ether's underperformance relative to bitcoin.  ""ETH’s underperformance is likely due to the ongoing impact of the bear market, which historically has seen traders turn to BTC, the oldest and largest crypto asset. ETH spot trade volume has also stayed mostly flat over the past two months, only spiking above $2bn a handful of times,"" Kaiko's research team said in a weekly note to subscribers on Monday.  The increased haven demand for bitcoin is also evident from its dominance rate or the share in the total crypto market, which has increased from 41% to 51% this year.  Per Amberdata's Greg Magadini, ether is at a disadvantage in the higher interest rate environment compared to bitcoin.  ""If ETH is the crypto tech stock and BTC is crypto gold, the higher rate environment we currently see in the macro landscape will have an outsized impact on the 'long duration' tech stock. Digital gold also is hurt by higher rates, but a bid is found in response to global fiat uncertainty and geopolitical risk,"" Magadini said in an email, noting the potential for continued ether underperformance ahead.  Last month, the Federal Reserve signaled that it intends to keep the benchmark borrowing cost above 5% next year, having lifted the same by 525 basis points since March 2022 to control inflation.  Bitcoin is widely seen as a digital gold in the crypto market, thanks to an inbuilt code on its blockchain that reduces the pace of its supply expansion by 50% every four years. The fourth so-called halving is due next year.  Magadini said the regulatory outlook also favors bitcoin.  ""BTC enjoys the 'commodity' asset category while ETH remains unclear. This crypto sector regulatory issue has a much higher impact on ETH,"" Magadini noted.  ""Even if ETH is deemed a “commodity” the DeFi projects built on TOP of ETH are subject to regulatory scrutiny. If DeFi usage drops in response to regulation, then the EIP-1559 Ultrasound money narrative suffers due to lower usage. The terminal value of ETH is greatly affected by the future of its issuance rate flipping from net burn to net issuance,"" Magadini added.

A multi-pronged attack on Israel by Hamas over the weekend has broken into all-out war, with the former’s defense minister ordering a complete siege of the Palestinian enclave Gaza.  The cyber arm of Israel Police's Lahav 433 unit worked with the country’s defense ministry, intelligence agencies and crypto exchange Binance to target the accounts in question, according to the report. It added that any funds seized are destined for the Israeli national treasury.

6872,http://blokt.com/?p=51476,1696932032,Tails OS – An Actionable Guide for Regular Folks,"Internet privacy is something a lot of people are concerned about. Despite this, not a lot of people know the best ways to go about it. This article will give you some information you need to make sure you can keep yourself protected from any When whistleblower Edward Snowden was communicating with Glenn Greenwald back in 2013 about the goings-on at the NSA, one of the tools he used to protect himself was Tails. But that was a long time ago. So does Snowden still like Tails? Here’s what he had to say on the subject in this December 13, 2017 tweet: TAILS ( @Tails_live , https://t.co/Re3LzE4WdO ) is the most accessible for normal folks looking to ""torify"" non-browser traffic, and a gentle introduction to Linux (which is still gonna be a learning experience). You can boot it from a USB stick without overwriting your everyday OS. https://t.co/eHqYarXFjZ — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 13, 2017 Even if you don’t understand exactly what he’s talking about (yet), this Tails thing is important. So please keep reading to learn what it is and why it has become so popular. What is Tails, and why do privacy fans love it? Tails is a unique computer operating system. It is designed to help you use the Internet anonymously and get around censorship. Tails is a live system (live operating system) that runs from a USB stick or DVD. It lets you connect to the Internet using virtually any computer while leaving no trace of your activities after you have finished. Even better, Tails is free software that anyone can install and use whenever and wherever privacy and anonymity are essential. What makes Tails safer than other operating systems? Because Tails was designed from the beginning to provide privacy and anonymity, it differs from other operating systems in several areas: Tails forces all Internet connections to go through the Tor network. Tor is a worldwide distributed network that prevents people from watching your network connection from knowing what websites you visit while keeping those websites from learning your physical location. For more details on how this works, visit the official About Tor page . Tails connects to the hardware of a computer but doesn’t use the operating system or disk drives. That means there is no permanent record of your activities on that computer. Once you remove the Tails USB Stick or DVD and restart the computer, there will be no way to tell Tails was used there. Tails comes with state-of-the-art encryption technology. From PGP and OTR support for secure communications to the automatic use of HTTPS when visiting websites to the ability to encrypt the files on your USB stick or DVD, Tails has you covered. With all these privacy and anonymity features together in a package that you can literally carry in your pocket, it is easy to see why privacy fans love Tails. This all sounds great, but you may still be wondering, “Is Tails safe to use?” Tails is far safer than the typical operating system, but it is not foolproof. There are various ways bad guys can get around the protections built into Tails. Here is a detailed explanation of Tails’ security limitations . Watch the following video for a more detailed introduction to Tails: One of the great things about Tails is that you can create your own Tails USB Stick or DVD and try it yourself. And since it is free software, all it will cost you is the USB Stick or DVD you install it on. In the following few sections, we’ll talk about the process of creating and configuring a Tails System using a USB Stick. We won’t walk you through the process step by step, as the details depend on the type of computer you install from and the media you will install to. We encourage you to create your own Tails System by following the instructions on the Download and Install Tails page that applies to your situation. Once we’re done, you’ll be able to see for yourself how Tails and its included software work. We’re going to: Download and verify Tails Install Tails on a USB Stick Configure Tails & Tor Tails 5.0 On the 3rd May 2022, Tails announced the launch of Tails 5.0. This is the first version of Tails to be based on Debian 11 includes lots of new versions of software and tools. Some features to note are: The addition of Kleopatra, a popular certificate manager, to replace the OpenPGP Applet and other utilities. The Additional Software feature is enabled by default to make it quicker to configure additional software packages. The activities overview can now be used to access windows and applications. Downloading and Verifying Tails We used a computer running Linux to create our Tails System. Clicking through the options on the Download and Install Tails page led us here: Tails Install Once we were ready, we clicked the big green “Let’s Go” button, which led us to the detailed instructions. From here on out, it was just a process of following the detailed instructions provided by the Tails team. We downloaded the Tails USB image then verified it using the Tails Verification browser extension. Verifying your download is vitally important. This will tell you if your download is somehow corrupted. Downloads are sometimes incomplete, or part of the download might not be 100% identical to the original. And sometimes, hackers break through the security on a website and replace the original with a hacked version. Verifying your download will spot any of these problems for you. Once we had a verified version of the Tails USB image on our computer, we followed the instructions for installing it on the USB stick. Installing and Running Tails on a USB Stick Installing Tails might be overstating things a bit here. All that we need to do is copy the verified Tails USB image onto your USB Stick. The instructions will tell you exactly how to do this for the computer you are using to install Tails. Running Tails for the first time may be more challenging than downloading and installing it. That’s because most computers are not configured to run from a USB Stick. We had this problem and had to spend some time figuring out how to get our computer set up correctly. The Tails does not start at all troubleshooting guide helped us deal with this. Configuring Tails There isn’t a lot of configuring to do with Tails initially. When you start Tails, you see a screen that looks like this one: Configuring Tails After you press Enter (or several seconds with no input), the Tails Greeter screen appears: Welcome to Tails Here you tell Tails the Language you want to use, the Keyboard Layout , and the Formats for things like the date and time. In addition, you can activate a full range of Accessibility options from the Universal Access menu: Tails Accessibility NOTE: The Tails team configured Tails to be as safe as possible by default. If you need to deviate from the defaults, the Additional Settings section of the Greeter is where you make those changes. We recommend you avoid making any changes here, if at all possible. Once you are done setting things up in Greeter, click the Start Tails button. A Quick Intro to the Tails Desktop Tails uses the GNOME graphical user interface . GNOME is used in several versions of Linux and is one of the more popular user interfaces. In Tails, the GNOME desktop looks like this: Tails Desktop The Top Navigation Bar contains the two main Tails menus, along with a group of icons with various functions. Here is a quick summary of what you’ll find in this navigation bar, from left to right: The Applications menu gives you shortcuts to the pre-installed software on Tails, along with some utilities for configuring the desktop. You’ll find all the basic applications you need to get things done here, along with some specialized stuff related to the privacy and anonymity features of Tails. The Places menu has shortcuts to folders on the system, as well as any storage media like disk drives that might be connected. The Calendar and Notifications appear together in the top center of the window. The OpenPGP Applet comes next. You’ll use this to encrypt and decrypt text for greater privacy. The Tor Status icon looks like an Onion, and you can click it to see the Open Onion Circuits Tails knows about. We talked about the Universal Access icon and menu back in the Configuring Tails section. The System menu contains information on your network connection, the status of the computer’s battery, and other settings. Connecting Tails to Your Network and the Internet Tails is of little use unless it is connected to the Internet. But before it can connect to the Internet, Tails needs to connect to your network. You can see the status of your connection to the local network in the System menu: Tails Desktop We had no problem connecting Tails to our local network. Once we did, it automatically connected itself to the Tor network and through that to the Internet. You can quickly see if you are connected to the Tor network by looking at the Tor Status icon in the top Navigation Bar. If Tails is connected to the Tor network, the Tor Status icon looks like this: If Tails is not connected to the Tor network, the Tor Status icon looks like this: While we had no problems, connecting Tails to the Internet doesn’t always go so smoothly. If you have problems, the Tails documentation has detailed instructions on how to connect to the Internet anonymously . The Tor Browser The Tor Browser is based on the popular Firefox browser. But it has been heavily modified, with your privacy and anonymity in mind. The developers stripped out services like JavaScript and cookies that can be used to defeat the anonymity provided by the Tor network. This makes the Tor Browser safer for you to use, but you may find that some websites don’t work right without these services. You can learn more about the differences at the Tor Browser page. Tails Tools for Privacy The Tor network and browser provide you with anonymity when using the Internet. But anonymity doesn’t guarantee privacy. Let’s take a quick look at a few of the most useful encryption tools that Tails gives you to boost your privacy. Why You Need Encryption Too This can be confusing, so let’s look at an example. Let’s say I want to send a message to my wife, Ruth. I don’t use an encrypted application to create it, so the message starts out in plain text. Before the message leaves my computer, Tor wraps it up in three layers of encryption. That’s an essential part of how Tor works . As my message passes through the network, Tor strips off layers of encryption. When my message leaves the Tor exit mode and goes to its destination, all the layers of encryption that Tor added are gone. What Tor has done is make it impossible to trace my message back to the computer it came from. This provides anonymity. But what about the contents of my message? The contents are now in the same state that it went into the Tor network. Since I sent a plain text message into the network, a plain text message comes out of the network. This might be fine, but it might be disastrous. When in doubt, it is best to be safe and use the encryption tools provided by Tails. That way, your messages, and data can only be read by the people who are supposed to read them. Even if they were somehow able to intercept your messages en route, all any snoop would see would be incomprehensible gibberish. Keeping Your Communications Secure Tails gives you several ways to keep your communications secure from prying eyes. Encrypting, Decrypting, and Verifying Messages with the OpenPGP Applet If you want maximum privacy, you should use the OpenPGP applet. Encrypting and decrypting messages is riskier if you do it in the web browser. To use the applet, you can compose your message in a text editor, then use the applet to encrypt it. Likewise, you can receive an encrypted message and import it into the applet before decrypting it. Using OpenPGP can be labor-intensive. If you are sending lots of encrypted messages by email, Thunderbird, an email program that comes pre-installed on Tails, might be a better option than OpenPGP. If you want to go this route, you can find more information at the Thunderbird Help page. Chatting Securely with the Pidgin Instant Messenger and OTR Encryption Pidgin Instant Messenger is a chat application that can connect to several different chat systems simultaneously. When combined with OTR (Off-the-Record) messaging, you get encryption and more. If you want to be able to chat securely while using Tails, get all the details at the Chatting with Pidgin page. Keeping Your Data Secure Normally Tails only stores data until you shut down. But if you are running Tails on a USB Stick with additional space available, you can create a Persistent Storage area on the USB Stick to retain data long term. There are pros and cons to creating a Persistent Storage area, and the Tails team advises against doing so in most cases. Still, if you need to store data securely, or add additional applications beyond those that come pre-installed, this is your best option. The Pros and Cons of Using Persistent Storage with Tails Pros Cons Allows you to store encrypted data on the Tails USB Stick The Persistent Volume is visible to anyone who has access to the USB Stick. You can install additional applications Installing non-default applications can break Tails security You can change the configuration of applications Changing configurations of default applications can weaken anonymity You can open the Persistent Storage from other operating systems Accessing Persistent Storage from other operating systems can compromise security To further minimize the risks of using Persistent Storage, you get to specify exactly which types of files Tails can store there. Tails Persistent Volume If you still want to go ahead after looking at the pros and cons, you’ll want to head to the Encrypted Persistence page for detailed instructions. Managing Passwords One of the best uses for Persistent Storage is to keep track of all your passwords. Using a different, strong password for each website and application that needs one is a must, but keeping track of them all without computerized help is almost impossible. To address this problem, Tails comes with KeePassX , an open quality password manager. You can use it to keep track of all your passwords while only needing to remember the single password that unlocks this application. Tails and Cryptocurrencies Make a Great Team If you are interested in cryptocurrencies and are familiar with crypto exchanges , you definitely want to check out Tails. Its privacy and anonymity make it a safer place to keep your cryptocurrency wallets than a standard computer. Tails includes a Bitcoin wallet in its pre-installed software. Built-in Bitcoin Support with the Electrum Wallet The Electrum Bitcoin Wallet comes standard with Tails. With only a little work, you can transfer your Bitcoin keys into Electrum. Once you do, your keys will be safer, and your Bitcoin transactions will gain the anonymity of the Tor network. To learn more about the Electrum Bitcoin Wallet, visit the Electrum Home Page . What about using Monero with Tails? Monero is a secure, private, and untraceable cryptocurrency. That makes Tails a natural place to store your Monero. If you want to keep your Monero on Tails, you’ll need to set up Persistent Storage on your Tails USB Stick. That’s because Tails does not have a pre-installed wallet for Monero as it does for Bitcoin. Here are the instructions for setting up Persistent Storage . Once you have that setup, here are the instructions for installing the Monero wallet on Tails . If you want the ultimate in security for your Monero, you’ll store it in a cold wallet. Tails is an ideal tool for creating such a wallet. Tails leaves nothing behind on a computer that could help a bad guy get access to your cold wallet or even know it exists. And by using Tails, you’ll be creating your cold wallet on a safer system. Check out this link if you are interested in creating a Monero cold wallet using Tails . Is Tails always the best solution for privacy and anonymity? While Tails is a great privacy operating system, it isn’t the only one available, or even the best for every situation. In particular, people interested in online privacy and anonymity often use Whonix or Qubes . So which is the best? As usual, the answer is, “it depends.” Let’s see how each one stacks up against Tails. Is Whonix better than Tails? Whonix typically runs as two VirtualBox virtual machines. You do your work in one virtual machine(the Workstation). The other (the Gateway) handles all connections between the Workstation and the Internet by passing them through the Tor network. This design means that any computer that can run VirtualBox should be able to run Whonix. This makes it easy to install Whonix, but there are some big security implications to this design. When you run Tails from a USB stick or DVD, it is the only operating system running on the computer. To run Whonix, you need to have the host operating system running too. You can easily jump back and forth between the private and anonymous Whonix workstation and the host computer. While this is convenient, it makes it all too easy to do something in the host when you should be doing it in Whonix and vice versa. Even worse, Whonix can’t force communications between the host and the Internet to go through Tor. If you do slip up and do something in the host that you shouldn’t, you’ve lost your anonymity. While Whonix has some advantages, we think Tails is a better privacy solution than Whonix. Is Qubes better than Tails? In some ways, Qubes is more like Tails than Whonix is. That’s because when you run Qubes, it is the only operating system running on the computer. This is inherently more secure than the Whonix approach since there is no way to accidentally get “outside” the secure Qubes environment. Qubes contains its own virtual machines with differing levels of trust for running applications. The virtual machines are completely isolated from each other by Qubes. This limits the damage that a bad app (like spyware or a virus) can do by confining that damage to one virtual machine. Qubes itself doesn’t provide any real anonymity. To address this, people sometimes run Whonix inside of Qubes . One big drawback of Qubes (with or without Whonix) is that there isn’t a Live USB version of it. This means that when you use Qubes, there will likely be traces of it leftover on the host computer once you end your session. As with Whonix, while Qubes has some benefits, we think Tails is a better solution overall. Is Tails right for you? Whether Tails is the “right” operating system for you depends on what you plan to do with it. You probably don’t want to use it as your main operating system. The features that make it such a good privacy tool can make it clumsy for full-time use. Installing your favorite software can be a hassle and may break the privacy protection that Tails provides. Making all your connections to the Internet go through the Tor network will slow down your browsing. But there are many situations where Tails is extremely useful for anyone concerned with online privacy and anonymity: Does it bother you that ISPs and websites watch what you do online and sell that information to marketers or hand it over to spy agencies? If so, using Tails can keep them from finding out anything useful about you. Have you ever had your personal data stolen from some poorly protected websites by hackers? Using Tails can minimize the amount of data sites have about you. They can’t lose what they don’t have. Do you need to visit sensitive websites that your government doesn’t want you to see? With Tails, you can anonymously get around the blocks they put up to stop you. Does your government have a system like China, where everything you do online is monitored and used to decide whether you are a good citizen or not? You can use Tails to anonymously do the things the government doesn’t like. Do you want to keep your cryptocurrencies safe? Keeping your cryptocurrency wallets on a Tails USB Stick adds layers of protection to your cryptos. In short, virtually anyone reading this can think of situations where they could use the privacy and anonymity that Tails can give you. We think it is a great tool, as long as you remember that nothing is 100% safe and secure. Check out the Tails warnings page to be sure you understand the limitations, then give Tails a try. And in case you were wondering why they call this thing “Tails,” the name is an acronym. It stands for “The Amnesic Incognito Live System.” Now you know.

42392358,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5nGp,1696932000,"Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison: Looking at Day 5 of Sam Bankman-Fried's Trial","FTX co-founder and former Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang began testifying in earnest last Friday in Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Wang revealed:  FTX’s insurance fund was calculated by taking the total volume of trades over the past 24 hours, multiplying that by “a random number that’s around 7,500” and dividing that figure by 1 billion (the prosecutor asked if the “number ha[d] anything to do with the actual number in the insurance fund?” to which the answer, obviously, was “no”).  FTX customer balances were “approximately equal” to what was in the company’s hot wallets – except there was an Alameda subaccount with a balance around minus $8 billion that was excluded from the list of customer balances.  In hindsight, we knew this, but FTX and Bankman-Fried were tweeting that FTX was fully liquid and funded after CoinDesk reported on the balance sheet even while FTX ran out of funds to honor withdrawal requests. (“FTX was not fine and assets were not fine because FTX did not have enough assets for customer withdrawals,” Wang said).  The defense began cross examining Wang on Friday, but Judge Lewis Kaplan cut attorney Christian Everdell off a few minutes prior to the scheduled end time after yet again warning the lawyer about repeating questions that have already been answered. Tuesday should see Everdell and his team complete the cross-examination.  Defense attorneys may try to poke holes in Wang’s assertions that Bankman-Fried directed or controlled a lot of what happened with Alameda’s use of FTX customer funds.  Later on Tuesday, Caroline Ellison is expected to take the stand. The defense is similarly likely to try and discredit her as a witness, whether by saying she did not heed Bankman-Fried’s warnings to hedge Alameda’s positions or by arguing her recollections or actions may have been impaired.  For their part, prosecutors say she can share information about the crimes she committed with Bankman-Fried. As a reminder, Ellison, like Wang, pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges last year, shortly after Bankman-Fried was arrested.  Sam Kessler has more here on how her testimony may shake out.  What we're expecting  As mentioned above, Caroline Ellison is expected to begin testifying in a few short hours, after the defense concludes its cross-examination of Gary Wang.  The DOJ also named BlockFi’s Zac Prince and Pinecone’s Elan Dekel as possible witnesses. While there does not seem to be a strict timeline for when they'll testify, they may follow Ellison.  That being said, given that Wang, one of the FTX inner circle, has already spent over a day testifying, my guess is we won’t hear from anyone but Ellison until later in the week at the earliest.",NEUTRAL,없음,TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/10/gary-wang-caroline-ellison-looking-at-day-5-of-sam-bankman-frieds-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He's asked Judge Lewis Kaplan for permission to quiz FTX co-founder Gary Wang about the issue.  Lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried want to quiz FTX co-founder Gary Wang about his reliance on legal advice when agreeing to a series of loans from linked hedge fund Alameda Research, according to a legal filing made late Monday night.  The letter, sent as Bankman-Fried’s trial enters its second week, seeks carve-outs from a judge who’s previously proved reluctant to let the crypto tycoon blame the alleged fraud on his lawyers.  Prosecutors have already probed Wang about around $200 million- $300 million of loans he received from Alameda, which he used to make venture investments and buy himself a house in the Bahamas.  Wang’s “understanding that these were actual loans – structured by lawyers and memorialized in formal promissory notes that imposed real interest payment obligations – is relevant to rebut the inference that these were simply sham loans directed by Mr. Bankman-Fried to conceal the source of the funds,” the filing said.  Wang has previously said he “didn't think the lawyers would tell him to sign something that was illegal,” the filing said.  The relationship between FTX and its hedge fund arm has proved crucial to the criminal case that followed the collapse of the crypto exchange in November 2022, as the prosecution has argued Bankman-Fried used funds illegitimately transferred to Alameda as his “personal piggy bank.”  Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges, and his lawyers say the involvement of company counsel in loan arrangements suggests that he didn't realize it was improper. Judge Lewis Kaplan has previously ruled that arguments over the advice received from counsel could confuse or prejudice the jury, and can’t be made in the defense’s opening statement.  Wang is expected to finish his testimony later Tuesday, to be followed by Caroline Ellison, the former head of Alameda Research who is also Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend. Both Wang and Ellison have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with investigators.

A bias for selling options indicates expectations for continued volatility lull.  Crypto traders seem unperturbed by the escalating tensions in the Middle East, which threaten to add risks to the already murky global economic outlook.  That's the message from the order flow in the bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) options market, which shows a bias for selling options, a strategy aimed at profiting from low volatility or price turbulence.  ""On an aggregate basis, it becomes evident that Deribit option order books exhibit a bias towards selling volatility. This is indicated by the bid/ask ratio consistently leaning below one, where a ratio less than one suggests a preference for selling. In contrast, a ratio greater than one indicates a preference for buying,"" crypto quant researcher Samneet Chepal told CoinDesk.  Options are derivative contracts that offer the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A call provides the right to buy and a put offers the right to sell. Ask price is the price at which the seller is ready to sell and bid is the value at which the buyer is ready to purchase.  Deribit is the world's largest crypto options exchange by open interest and trading volumes, controlling over 85% of the global activity in bitcoin and ether options.  Geopolitical events like the latest Israel-Palestine conflict, central bank actions and economic data announcements typically have traders buying options. The strategy is preferred on the premise that these events could trigger substantial market fluctuations.  The tensions in the Middle East couldn't have come at a worse time. Several nations are already staring at stagflation, the worst possible outcome for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Still, bitcoin and ether continue to trade largely steady. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has been locked in a narrow range of $27,000- $28,500 this month. Ether, meanwhile, remains stuck in the two-month range of $1,550- $1,750.  The chart shows the bid-ask order book depth ratio in bitcoin and ether options traded on Deribit as of early Asian hours. The below-1 ratio shows the order book quotes leaned more toward the asks, a bias for sell trades.  The data is consistent with the implied volatility (IV) meltdown in bitcoin and ether since the beginning of the year.

Executives scrambled to move over $1 billion worth of various assets to different storage devices as the exchange was getting drained of funds, ultimately managing to save the majority of the money. This means a majority of the exchange’s entire balance was at risk of getting stolen, as per the report.  Accounts tied to FTX and FTX.US were drained on Nov. 11, 2022, mere hours after the company filed for bankruptcy and founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned from the crypto empire he ran.  John J. Ray III, the CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of the FTX Debtors, which handles the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, later said that $323 million in various tokens were hacked from its international exchange and $90 million from its U.S. platform.  As per an April filing, most funds held on FTX were held on hot wallets - or crypto storage that’s directly connected to public computers that access the internet, creating an attack vector.  The attackers, whose identity remains unknown, were likely able to gain access to the private keys – or a password that gives their holders access to that wallet – of FTX’s wallets and started to drain the funds.  But, after the bankruptcy, few in the team knew the exact number of wallets owned by FTX or where their private keys were located, per Wired.  The team watched accounts getting drained in real-time before Gary Wang, an FTX co-founder who is currently facing allegations of fraud alongside Bankman-Fried, was able to access some wallets and started to transfer funds out.  Wang managed to send Kumanan Ramanathan, an adviser to FTX from legal consultancy Alvarez & Marsall, some $500 million to a wallet on Ramanathan’s Ledger Nano, a hardware wallet. The draining of FTX funds stopped after this transfer.  The next day, Wang and Bankman-Friend transferred another tranche of $500 million to wallets supplied by crypto custodian BitGo. These steps ultimately helped the firm save over $1 billion that could have otherwise been lost.  Meanwhile, the entirety of stolen funds have been on the move in the past week, deepening one of the ongoing mysteries around the exchange's collapse last year.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | WALLET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/10/ftx-could-have-lost-over-1b-due-to-lax-security-practices-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15b707d34c74e847a4b1592bd08a1095ccfcefb1-2048x1535.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Notably, during this turbulent period, XRP slipped below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, signaling a bearish sentiment in the market. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, XRP’s price stands at $0.497, reflecting a 3.9% decline in the last 24 hours and a 3.1% dip over the past week. Crypto expert Benjamin Cowen weighed in on the situation, characterizing the recent drop in altcoin prices as a typical phase in the market cycle. “Namely, where BTC drops, but BTC dominance goes up because altcoins are dropping more. It is always the most brutal part of the market cycle,” Cowen noted. This perspective underscores the interconnectedness of the cryptocurrency market and the complex dynamics that influence price movements. XRP market cap halfway to the $27 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com Technical Indicators, Potential Scenarios For XRP’s Future Furthermore, technical indicators are hinting at the possibility of a bearish momentum building up for XRP. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped below the neutral line at 50.0, indicating weakening buying pressure. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which measures momentum changes, is inching closer to a potential bearish divergence. If the MACD line crosses below the signal line, XRP may face further declines. In this scenario, there’s a real possibility that XRP’s price could drop to the September low of $0.47. Falling below this crucial level could result in the altcoin reaching a three-month low. However, if the broader sentiment in the market turns positive, XRP might manage to hold the $0.505 support level. As XRP navigates these turbulent waters, investors and enthusiasts will be closely watching for any signs of a reversal in its fortunes and hoping for a brighter future ahead.

It could accelerate lower and revisit the $0.45 support. Ripple’s token price is declining from the 0.550 resistance against the US dollar. The price is now trading above $0.500 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.5065 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it breaks the $0.488 support zone. XRP Price Takes Hit Recently, XRP made another attempt to clear the $0.550 resistance. However, the bulls failed to clear the $0.550 barrier. The price traded as high as $0.5510 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a steady decline below the $0.532 and $0.525 levels. The price even declined below the $0.50 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Finally, it retested the $0.488 support zone.

Initial support on the downside is near the $0.488 zone. The next major support is at $0.450. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.450 level, XRP price might turn red.

18577557,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554704,1696899646,XRP Is A Better Buy Now Than H1 2023: What’s Keeping Prices Low?,"Edward Farina, the founder and CEO of various crypto-focused initiatives, is confident that XRP is a better “investment” in early October than it was before July when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claimed that the coin was an unregistered security. In a post on October 9, Farina asserted that the coin was declared not a “security,” but was bothered by the fact that prices are at “the same level” as before the July 13 ruling. XRP Bears Reversed July 2023 Gains XRP, the native coin of the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain that recently supported smart contracts, remains one of the most liquid crypto assets. Looking at price data from CoinMarketCap (CMC), the coin is lodged at fifth in the market cap leaderboard, trailing Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), BNB, and USDT–the stablecoin. Related Reading: TWT Token Registers 20% Gains As Crypto Market Slumps, What’s Next? At this level, the coin is one of the most liquid and has managed to shake off bear pressure since the SEC lodged a lawsuit against some of Ripple’s top brass, including Brad Garlinghouse. In the lawsuit filed in late 2020, the agency said Ripple conducted an illegal crowdfund, raising over $1 billion by selling unregistered securities. With the allegations, XRP prices fell by 78%, crashing from around $0.77 to $0.17 in days. XRP found reprieve in 2021 when it shook off losses, rallying to as high as $1.95 despite the ongoing lawsuit where Ripple lawyers defended the company against claims put forward by the regulator. Prices fell in 2022, reversing gains before stabilizing in the better half 2023. In July, XRP prices rose sharply, briefly reaching $0.92 before cooling off, peeling back all gains in mid-August. Prices have stabilized, but bears wiped gains from the rally induced on July 13 when a United States court ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to the general public on an exchange. Still, it is when sold to institutional investors. In early October 2023, Judge Analisa Torres barred the SEC from appealing the decision made in July, stating that there was no “substantial ground for difference of opinion.” The trial is not set for April 2024. Prices Make Zero Sense? Following the Judge’s decision barring the agency from appealing, XRP prices have been relatively firm but at pre-July 2023 levels. Farina believes that XRP ought to be higher at spot rates, a reason why the market “makes absolute zero sense and price manipulation is real.” Related Reading: $29,700 Could Be The Next Big Level To Claim For Bitcoin, Here’s Why Whether XRP prices are manipulated or not is not clear at spot rates.

18575794,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554686,1696896008,Solana Outshines Bitcoin? A Dive Into Last Week’s Crypto Asset Inflows,"Last week marked a noteworthy surge for Solana in inflows, leading the pack in altcoin investment interests and outshining Bitcoin. Solana’s recent performance particularly placed it in the spotlight as it amassed roughly $24 million, the altcoin registered its largest inflow since March 2022, according to a recent report from Coinshares. A Closer Look: Dissecting The Solana Inflow Surge Diving into the numbers, the broader digital-asset investment domain observed net inflows for the second consecutive week, accumulating a significant $78 million, showcasing a bullish sentiment reminiscent of July’s performance. Related Reading: Will October Be Bitcoin’s Golden Month Again? A Dive Into A Decade Of Bullish Trends While Bitcoin, the quintessential crypto giant, continued to dominate, Solana grabbed headlines. As highlighted by James Butterfill, Head of Research, Solana’s re-emergence as a sought-after altcoin signifies its growing appeal among digital investors, especially in light of recent Ethereum futures ETF product launches. According to the report, with a noteworthy track record for 2023, Solana funds reported inflows for 28 weeks, with a mere four weeks registering outflows. Always a major player, Bitcoin recorded inflows of $43 million. The report disclosed that a certain subset of investors, potentially riding on Bitcoin’s recent price momentum, initiated positions in short-bitcoin products, leading to an inflow of $1.2 million within the week. Diverging Investment Patterns: Europe Leads While ETH ETFs Underwhelm Geographically, Europe continued its digital asset supremacy, accounting for 90% of the total inflows. On the contrary, the combined inflows from the US and Canada totaled a mere $9 million. According to Butterfill, this noticeable regional disparity in investment sentiments underscores evolving market dynamics and investor preferences. Adding to the digital fervor, trading volumes for exchange-traded products surged by 37%, settling at $1.13 billion for the week. Trusted exchanges dealing with Bitcoin also witnessed a 16% jump in trading volume. However, it wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. The recent US launch of six Ethereum futures ETFs raked below $10 million. While seemingly substantial, Butterfill termed the response as showcasing a “tepid appetite,” particularly when juxtaposed against the $1 billion amassed by Bitcoin futures ETFs in their inaugural week back in 2021. However, Butterfill attributed this difference more to the contrasting market environments and the “poor investor appetite” for digital assets rather than a direct reflection of the asset’s potential. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Face Lackluster Debut From Small Investors: Is The Hype Fizzling Out? Furthermore, regardless of the recorded positive inflows from Solana last week, the altcoin is currently facing a bloodbath along with Bitcoin. Notably, Solana has declined by nearly 10% in the past week and 4.5% in the past 24 hours, with a market price of $22.30 at the time of writing. In contrast, Bitcoin has also shed its portion of losses, down by 2.9% in the past 7 days and 1.4% in the past day, with a trading price currently at $27,518.
