Instead of putting all your money in a single cryptocurrency, you should invest in multiple cryptocurrencies at different price ranges. This way, you can lessen the risks associated with investment and maximize profits due to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices. What is a long-term cryptocurrency investment? Long-term cryptocurrency investment is investing in cryptocurrency for an extended period. This type of investment is not one you make to make huge profits, though it can be successful. This type of investment aims to capitalize on the long-term future potential in cryptocurrency prices. Unlike short-term investments, long-term investments are usually made based on saving or saving for the future. When you invest in cryptocurrencies for long periods, you need to wait for them to reach their maximum potential before selling your holdings at a profit. It&apos;s important to understand that cryptocurrencies typically have steadier growth patterns that do not fluctuate too much, unlike stocks with erratic growth and volatility.

However, there is a new term in town and it is called ICO or Initial Coin Offering. Sounds confusing right? Well, worry not, because we&apos;re here to tell you all about this term which almost seems like a cousin of IPO. What is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)? Initial Coin Offering is very similar to Initial Public Offering, wherein the public invests their capital in exchange for equity shares. Except, unlike in an IPO where investors exchange capital for stocks of the company, the investors receive cryptocurrency tokens for their investments. Like in an IPO, the main purpose here is to raise capital to launch a new app, coin, or service. What are the Types of Initial Coin Offerings? Typically, Initial Coin Offerings are of three types - Static Supply and Static Price - A specific funding goal is set by the Company and a fixed number of tokens are offered at a fixed price. Static Supply and Dynamic Price - The Company offers a fixed number of tokens but at a dynamic price. So, the demand of the tokens decides its price per token.

42407277,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVUN6p,1648312682,Is Miner Concentration Once Again Jeopardizing Bitcoin? Not Exactly,"One of the main pillars of bitcoin’s (BTC) value proposition is decentralization. Why then does the computer processing power behind the largest cryptocurrency seem to be concentrating again in one place, this time North America? The answer is multifaceted but some of the main reasons come down to where it's the safest in this geopolitical environment and most profitable for the miners to operate.  This article is part of Bitcoin’s Mining Week series.  Following China’s sweeping crackdown on the country’s crypto industry last year, miners packed up their businesses and fled to other parts of the world, where the geopolitical situation is more stable and cheap power is plentiful. They moved largely to North America, particularly to the U.S.  According to a report released by Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (CCAF) in October, the U.S. accounted for 35.4% of bitcoin’s global computing power, or hashrate, at the end of August, more than doubling the 16.8% share at the end of April. Kazakhstan and Russia followed the U.S. with hashrate shares of 18.1% and 11%, respectively, at that time. Meanwhile, mining operations in mainland China had effectively dropped to zero, down from a high of 75.53% in September 2019.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  Most recently, the digital-asset investment firm CoinShares said in a research report that the largest global mining country is the U.S., with an estimated 49% of total global hashrate located in the region as of Dec. 31, 2021.  This concentration counters bitcoin’s promise of a decentralized network, where in an ideal world hashrate would be evenly distributed globally. But the reality is far from ideal and given geopolitical instability in some key regions, the trend of miners moving to the U.S. is likely to continue.  “Ideally, miners would distribute bitcoin's hashrate across the globe and multiple jurisdictions, but they will migrate to the most favorable business, energy, and political climates they can find – that's why they are coming to the United States,” said Colin Harper, head of content and research at crypto software and services company Luxor Technology.  It's not hard to see why a miner would rather be in North America than anywhere else as lawmakers worldwide are starting to clamp down on crypto miners. Kazakhstan, which was a popular destination for miners leaving China, called for higher taxes, cut off power and cracked down on illegal mining operations. In February, Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency miner BIT Mining (BTCM) halted its near-$10 million mining data center construction project in Kazakhstan, citing unstable local power supply.

Russia has its own geopolitical problems at the moment.  Rule of Law and cheap power  Having the assurance that a whole industry will not be just uprooted or disrupted overnight by the government is one of the main considerations for anyone planning to start any business, particularly in such a young sector as crypto mining.  This arguably makes the U.S., with its constitutional protections and federal system, the safest place for miners to set up. “The United States is one of the better countries to experience hashrate concentration because the United States' federal structure ensures strong rule of law and robust states’ rights,'' Luxor's Harper said.  Particularly after miners got burned by China’s ban, a repeat of such total disruption to business would be costly, especially given the sector has become brutally competitive, while margins sunk from their peak of 90% to between 60% and 70%.

Simple: Fat Profits  “If it had to be that a single country hosts a large percentage of the network hashrate, then I am glad that this is in the United States, given its federated system in which individual states have large autonomy over lawmaking within their borders,” said Jurica Bulovic, head of mining at Foundry (a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk).  “That diminishes the risk of an abrupt, country-wide ban on bitcoin mining, like we have seen in China,” Bulovic said.  Or, as Bryan Bullett, CEO of mining firm Bit Digital put it in October: “nobody wants to operate in a region where they face existential risks.”  Dave Perrill, CEO of data centers operator Compute North, said the U.S. also has better access to infrastructure and a lower cost of power.  However, such a large concentration of miners relocating in the U.S. has started to draw the ire of lawmakers and regulators alike, given these firms’ massive demand for energy.  In March, the Environmental Conservation Committee of the New York State Assembly voted to move along a proposed law that would ban proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency mining for two years. Meanwhile, some federal lawmakers led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have scrutinized crypto mining companies on their climate impact.  Most recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed a new regulation that would require publicly traded companies to report information on greenhouse-gas emissions and risks related to climate change, which would affect miners due to their energy consumption. However, the mining community, for the most part, welcomed this proposed rule.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining and ESG: A Match Made in Heaven  However, it's doubtful the U.S. government will try to ban digital asset mining altogether as many states have already embraced the industry.  “It's unlikely that the federal government would move to ban or disrupt mining, and if they did, the decision would have to go through federal courts, not to mention the fact that states would fight tooth-and-nail against a PoW prohibition,” Harper said.  To complicate matters for policymakers, the mining industry has already turned into a multibillion-dollar industry. In Feb. 28 research note, Wall Street bank B. Riley’s analyst Lucas Pipes wrote that the industry has already grown to almost $100 billion in gross value of bitcoin to be mined..  “Most simply, to derive total industry value, we multiply coins to be mined times current BTC price plus transaction fees. Today, this value is approximately $92 [billion],” he said, using a bitcoin price of $38,000. As of this writing, the price of bitcoin was back up to $44,000.  Such a large industry will likely be hard to strike down completely in a short period of time.  Read more: Crypto Mining, the Energy Crisis and the End of ESG  Bitcoin mining pool concentration  Another threat to bitcoin’s decentralization is a handful of mining pools controlling too much hashrate.  “Mining pools are, by definition, a centralizing force in the bitcoin mining ecosystem,” Foundry’s Bulovic said. “They provide a service of aggregating hashrate from individual miners in order to minimize the inherent revenue volatility, and provide stable payouts.”  Read more: What are Bitcoin Mining Pools?  Foundry USA is the largest bitcoin pool in the world, with almost 20% of the total network’s hashrate, according to BTC.com data as of March 25.  This concentration may seem like another threat to the decentralization thesis. However, mining pools don’t control the network and don’t have a lot of clout, because any miner can quickly change pools if there is any hint of foul play, such as censoring bitcoin transactions, Bulovic said.  “Furthermore, there are developments such as Stratum [version]2 that would, among other things, empower individual miners to construct block templates, taking that power away from mining pools,” he added. Stratum V2 is a new bitcoin mining protocol that is being developed, improving on many aspects of the previous version, Stratum V1, which miners use to communicate with the mining pools. The improvements include more efficient data transfer and protections against network centralization.  “The full feature set of Stratum V2, offers the miner the choice to select their own transaction set and construct their own block templates [that determines which transactions go inside them], allowing miners to easily revolt against pools that misbehave on censorship to the detriment of the broader Bitcoin network,” according to a recent research report by Rachel Rybarczyk, a vice president at Galaxy Digital Mining. “Even if miners don’t utilize this power, the mere threat that they could, will deter pools from misbehaving.”  Self-interest and bitcoin mining  The numbers showing regional concentration and the mining pools’ outsized market share of the total hashrate look like a threat to decentralization. However, as long as their motivation is profit, it would be counterproductive for the miners to attack the network by banding together.  “To hit on the point about a threat to decentralization, miners ultimately act in their own interests,” Harper said, noting that they compete against each other, and wouldn't stand to benefit by cooperating to attack the network that generates their income. And a purely malicious actor with no profit motive (say, a hostile state) would find an attack difficult and expensive to carry out, given the heft of the competition to mine blocks.  However, such concentration does increase regulatory scrutiny for the miners from the country they are setting up their business in, Harper said.  Luckily, “I think the United States' federal structure provides unique insulation against a state-sponsored attack [against the miners],” he said.

42421185,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIUH,1648310400,Why Did John McAfee Stop Paying Taxes? ‘I’d Just Had Enough’,"John McAfee, who died in a Spanish prison last year while awaiting extradition to the U.S. on fraud charges, lived a wild life on every conceivable level, which culminated in a high-profile escape from Belize in 2012 after being accused of murdering his neighbor.  When Scottish writer Mark Eglinton interviewed him in a series of conversations in 2019 and 2020, the cybersecurity pioneer turned crypto promoter was in hiding, having fled the U.S on a yacht following the convening of a Grand Jury in Tennessee. McAfee fled to the Bahamas, then Cuba and then finally the Dominican Republic, from where he was extradited to the U.K, the country of his birth. After arriving in London, McAfee went dark. As it turned out later, he had gone into hiding in what has become known as The Bitcoin Hotel in the Barcelona area of Spain, the country where he was eventually arrested while trying to board a flight to Istanbul..  The interviews were originally intended to be for McAfee’s autobiography. When the commissioning publisher refused to pay in crypto, McAfee granted Eglinton permission to publish a book based on their many hours of conversations.  Read more: McAfee's Wild Ride From Infosec Exec to Crypto Bad Boy (2021)  “No Domain: The John McAfee Tapes,” is now set to be adapted into a film. True to the spirit of his subject, Eglinton is selling a special edition of his book, including a non-fungible token (NFT), on the Bitcoin SV blockchain (a fork, or splinter network, from Bitcoin Cash, itself a fork of the main Bitcoin chain) through the Canonic platform. (It's also available in regular form on Amazon.)  Here's an excerpt.  Mark Eglinton: Why was the Grand Jury convened in the first place?  John McAfee: At the end of 2018 I heard about the convening from two separate sources, two weeks in advance of when it was meant to happen. On behalf of the [U.S. Internal Revenue Service,] myself, [my wife] Janice and four of our compatriots were being charged with unspecified tax fraud charges. Grand juries are only convened for felonies. Felonies mean serious jail time. However, I knew this was coming. I had not paid tax for 10 years.  Why not?  I’d just had enough. I’d paid $50 million in income tax over the years. I thought that was plenty. I hadn’t paid tax since I went to Belize, but technically, as an American citizen, even if you’re not living in the country, using the services and driving on the roads, you still have to file and pay 30% of your income to the United States. The only two countries in the world that enforce that rule are the United States and Eritrea! How [frigging] bizarre is that? Anyway, I just said, “I’m sorry. This is insane. I’m not doing this anymore.” For a while nothing happened.  What changed?  In 2017, after my [U.S.] presidential run, I started going onto the international stage to talk about cryptocurrency. I was in Stockholm, London, Barcelona; I showed up wherever anyone would have me and I said the same thing: “Cryptocurrency can free us from the imprisonment that existing currency has put us in.” “What business is it of our governments to know what we earn?’ I also said many times.  I then explained how the [U.S.] dollar and [U.K.] pound, etc. are controlled; The supply can be influenced, which in turn can devalue people’s hard-earned money and how everything is monitored through the central banks. I then explained how, in America, income tax is in fact unconstitutional anyway. It was only ever created to fund the war effort in 1913, but that edict, like many others, was never extinguished after the need for it ceased to exist.  You were basically encouraging people not to pay tax.  I was telling people that I thought taxes were illegal, and if they also felt that they were illegal and/or unjust they should just stop paying, too. Not just that, I was showing them how to do it without getting caught.  Now that hit a nerve, as I knew it would. Here’s the thing: I’m not here just to mouth off. No, I am here to goad and to prod my enemy. I like doing that, just like the Apache Indians had something called “Counting coup” where they knew they could kill their enemy, but preferred to poke them repeatedly and run away. Basically I was annoying the [crap] out of my enemy. But all of this goading finally tipped the balance.  Read more: John McAfee Won't Promote ICOs Anymore Because of 'SEC Threats' (2018)  So did you get any warning that they were looking at you?  I got fair warning because the IRS and [Securities and Exchange Commission] started subpoenaing records from companies that I worked for in the states. That was a sign that they were watching me. Most men in my situation would have simply shut the [hell] up. Instead, I started talking louder.  Grand Juries are intentionally top secret so that people can’t run. But I’m John McAfee. You can’t keep a secret from me, especially if you’re my government. I don’t just listen to one source and take it as gospel, though. I got the information verified by another source, and based on that information we knew we had until a certain date to flee the country.  If you hadn’t fled, would someone have literally turned up at your door?  Absolutely, they would have swooped in and collected me in my home at 6 a.m. – with particular emphasis on “swoop” – and I’d have probably been thrown in jail for the rest of my life. I wouldn’t be able to talk to you. I wouldn’t be able to talk to the press. I might be in hiding now, but I get more exposure than ever. Plus I am still prodding that hornets nest as often as possible.  Since I’ve been on the run I have posted publicly on Twitter things like: “The SEC is a festering pustule on the face of America.” I don’t know how you goad them any more blatantly than that. It’s my job to do it because, more than anything, I want the government to show its true face. We can all put on a face, including our governments. But only when it’s poked hard enough and it responds hard enough does it show the world what it really is. And that’s what I’m trying to do with the U.S government. I want the world to see that what’s happening to me could also be happening to them. And in 20 years’ time could be happening to everybody if I don’t at least continue my fight.

42407275,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVUNGk,1648309861,Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?,"Around 15,000 cryptocurrency mining rigs are humming away at HIVE Blockchain’s (HIVE) 30 megawatt (MW) data center in Boden, Sweden. But not all the time. Sometimes, the facility powers down to help the local grid.  The data center, drawing cheap energy from local hydropower producers, acts as one of the largest, if not the largest, active energy reserves the Swedish grid can call upon whenever there are major disturbances to the local power supply. The facility can shut down its machines almost instantaneously so that energy can quickly be diverted to public use.  “In five seconds, we have to power down half of what we have allowed into the system,” said Johanna Thornblad, HIVE Blockchain’s Sweden country president. “And within 30 seconds, the entire power supply that is being requested has to be participating in the FCR-D system” – the Frequency Containment Reserve for Disturbances that keeps the lights on in the region.  When managed like that, the energy demand of HIVE’s mine is an asset to the local electricity grid; the miners are a stable source of cash flow when public energy consumption is low, but can power off during peak hours.  The mutually beneficial relationship between the HIVE facility and the local grid shows another side to the well-worn story of crypto mining’s environmental consequences.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Mining Week series.  A popular narrative among politicians, media and the industry’s most vocal critics is that mining is cooking the Earth. Miners have indeed been known to bring fossil fuel plants back from the twilight zone – thanks to their insatiable and indiscriminate thirst for cheap power. Bitcoin (BTC) is therefore said to be gobbling up the world’s precious energy and consequently responsible for a large amount of carbon emissions.  “You cannot waste energy sustainably,” Pete Howson, a senior lecturer in the geography and environmental sciences department at the U.K.’s Northumbria University, told CoinDesk, aptly summarizing the critics’ view.  Globally, bitcoin mining alone consumes 136 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year, estimates the Cambridge University Center for Alternative Finance. That’s about the same amount of electricity as Argentina, the United Arab Emirates or Sweden. But that’s only about half of what data centers run for other purposes consume, which the International Energy Agency (IEA) puts at 200-250 TWh.  U.S. and European lawmakers have been making arguments such as the ones mentioned above when scrutinizing the environmental impact of bitcoin mining. Last week, proof-of-work mining, used by the Bitcoin network, narrowly escaped its demise in the European Union: Lawmakers voted down a proposal that would have banned proof-of-work mining but made allowances for protocols such as Ethereum that were transitioning to other verification methods that consume less electricity, like proof-of-stake.  Read more: What Is Proof-of-Work?  Concurrently with these criticisms, the bitcoin mining industry has shifted dramatically toward renewables.  Estimates of how much bitcoin mining is powered by renewables range from 40% to 75%, The New York Times reported in September 2021. A report by crypto asset management firm CoinShares found that as of December 2021, renewables contributed under 30% of the total energy consumed by the bitcoin network, with nuclear power responsible for 11% of the total and natural gas contributing another 24%.  Although carbon emissions from mining have been growing overall along with the industry, they have decreased relative to megawatt hours of electricity used and terahashes of computing power produced, CoinShares found.  More than cleaning up its own act in the process of decarbonization, the crypto industry might help energy producers build more renewable energy that the rest of society can use.  Read more: After Short-Lived Ban, City in Upstate NY Is Still Reckoning With Crypto Miners  The benefits of renewables for crypto miners  For many miners, using renewable sourced electricity makes a lot of economic sense. Overall, renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels, so it can preserve miners’ profit margins.  “Generally speaking, electricity from renewables is as competitive if not cheaper than fossil fuel-based electricity,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web, a U.S. company that is helping a consortium of miners build transparency around their energy sources, known as the Crypto Climate Accord.  Not only are fossil fuels more expensive, but they are vulnerable to external price shocks such as the war in Ukraine.  An interesting dynamic emerging from the conflict is that, with fossil fuel prices through the roof, renewable energy is even more attractive, said Mellerud. “We will likely see more miners moving towards renewables due to this shock.”  Howson, who studies the social and environmental impact of bitcoin mining, is skeptical of such arguments. The fact that renewable energy is not produced 24/7, 365 days a year, makes it less attractive to miners, he said. “Every minute the sun’s not shining or wind’s not blowing, or it’s dry season so no hydro, they’re losing money,” he told CoinDesk.  Miners have another incentive to move toward cleaner energy sources: They can “lower their cost of capital since they have a better chance of attracting institutional investors that operate under ESG-mandates,” said Jaran Mellerud, researcher at Oslo-based Arcane Research. “Environmental, social and governance” is a set of criteria for making investments that looks at social goals in addition to financial returns.  Companies, especially those traded on public markets, are under pressure to decarbonize, said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. As miners went public, their energy consumption became public information, and “and as you might imagine, no company, especially in the public markets, is immune to ESG pressures. We're all in the role at this point in the back of a Tesla moving in the right direction,” Belizaire said.  “Still, some miners will resort to buying carbon offsets as an easy solution, as some of them already do today,” Mellerud said. These are transferable credits for reducing emissions, which companies can sell on the market.  If a miner intending to be green joins the industry, fossil fuel-powered miners, such as players using coal in Kazakhstan, or gas-powered ones in Texas, are incentivized to increase their energy consumption to keep up, Howson said.  A growing way of using renewable energy to power mining is through what can be called behind-the-meter solutions. That’s when an electricity producer connects a couple, or a couple thousand, mining rigs close to the energy asset, so the power goes directly to the miners, instead of going through the grid (and its meters).  No man’s energy  A fair amount of the world’s renewable energy is stranded or curtailed, meaning it is located far from demand and there is no good way to transmit it to regions with high usage. As a result, producers might turn off or limit their energy production. California clocked 1.5 TWh of curtailed energy from wind and solar in 2021, according to the state’s grid operator.  Read more: Crypto Mining, the Energy Crisis and the End of ESG  In addition, a lot of energy dissipates when it is transmitted over long distances, so it makes economic sense to consume it where it is produced, said PoW Energy co-founder Alejandro de la Torre, whose company crypto builds mines around Europe.  For example, in northern Norway, electricity priceshttps://www.nordpoolgroup.com/Market-data1/Regulating-Power1/Regulating-Power--Area1/NO21/Norway1/ are about 10 times less than the southern part of the country because there is abundant hydroelectric power but barely any industry or population to consume it.  “The energy production [in the north] and the potential for more production is so much higher than the local demand for that energy and the capacity to export it to other areas,” Kjetil Pettersen, CEO of Oslo-based miner Kryptovault, told CoinDesk.  However, countries around the world are working to develop better transmission lines such that energy can be consumed or exported. Germany will spend $55 billion on such projects by the end of 2030, estimates the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action.  Thanks to the abundant hydroelectric energy, northern Norway, which is not directly connected to the rest of Europe, has been impervious to a sharp uptick in energy prices in the south of the country, and doesn’t expect any increases soon, said Oleg Blinkov, head of data center development and operations at Bitfury, one of Europe’s e largest miners.  Kryptovault is considering establishing facilities there to soak up the excess energy. The same is true for northern Sweden, where cheap, abundant energy has attracted everything from Facebook data centers to crypto mining operations to the region.  Bitcoin mining can act as a demand-side response to the problem of curtailed or stranded energy. “The grid is having a real challenge integrating large amounts of power,” Belizaire said. Three things are needed to fix this problem; transmission capacity, flexible loads, and energy storage, he said.  The IEA estimates that another 500 gigawatts (GW) of demand responses need to be brought online by 2030 to achieve net zero carbon emissions globally by 2050. That’s a tenfold increase compared to the capacity of demand-side responses brought online in 2020. Demand responses try to balance the grid by increasing or reducing energy consumption to match the supply.  Read more: Don’t Call It a Comeback: The Unlikely Rise of Home Bitcoin Mining  The next decade will be messy, Morris said. Power grids will become increasingly complicated as they integrate a growing array of energy sources. “It's gonna get worse before it gets better,” he said, adding that crypto mining should be a necessary part of the solutions available to energy suppliers.  Howson countered that, overall, mining is encouraging fossil fuel energy production more than it is promoting renewable energy. “For every farmer plugging a few ASICs into their biodigester, there’s an entire fossil fuel power plant reopening to satisfy bitcoin’s energy demands,” he said.  Trade groups who tout the former type of miner are simply engaging in ”a massive greenwashing drive,” he said.  Ultimately, the industry “is delaying grid transitions to renewables,” by making oil and gas industries more profitable, Howson said.  Increasing the proportion of wind and solar energy in the grid will increase the need for energy reserves that can be tapped on demand, like HIVE’s Boden mine that can power on and off, Mellerud said.  “These energy sources are variable and not controllable, as they only generate power when the weather allows it,” he said. In other words, the supply of energy becomes less flexible the more wind and solar is integrated in the grid, such that the demand side has to make up for the difference.  Another interesting model is that manufacturing facilities, such as clothing factories, can use any excess energy that they didn’t spend during the manufacturing process to power in-house bitcoin mines, de la Torre said. This is happening, for example, in Spain, he said.  The energy flexibility of crypto miners  For Eric Thedéen, the Swedish financial regulator who called for a ban on proof-of-work mining in the European Union, miners are using electricity that would otherwise be available for other industries.  “This energy is urgently required for the development of fossil-free steel, large-scale battery manufacturing and the electrification of our transport sector,” he wrote in November.  Indra Overland, head of the energy program at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, agrees with Thedéen’s standpoint, adding that even if miners used energy in places where there is an abundance of it, they would still be competing against other industries also looking to take advantage of cheap renewables.  “The energy transition requires a reorganization of many sectors,” Overland said in an email to CoinDesk in February. This process is already ongoing and will accelerate in the coming years. Many energy-intensive industries will move to locations where there is abundant clean energy. Clogging up those locations with cryptocurrency mining will slow down this process.”  The “unique nature of the miners’ energy consumption profile” is so good for soaking up curtailed energy, that it is hard for other industries to compete, said SAI Tech CEO Arthur Lee, whose firm develops technology to make mines more efficient and green. “Clean energy stations are mostly built in remote places, which attract energy consumers who have mobility and huge power demand – miners fit into this profile perfectly.”  These unique characteristics are advantages for energy producers looking to balance their grid loads, said Andrew Webber, founder and CEO of Digital Power Optimization, which helps energy producers balance their loads and maximize profits using a host of solutions.  It doesn’t require high latency internet connections, which might not be available at remote edges of the world where renewable power plants are, and also doesn’t need to be running at all times, unlike other types of consumer data centers, he said.  “If Amazon or Google plop down and build a data center, and buy power from a power producer, first of all, they want that power 24/7,” he said. “They never want to shut off because Instagram photos, web applications, and the CIA's data is there on their servers, and they need that data to be up 24/7. They can't have glitches; they can't have downtime.”  Automating the process through which mines turn on and off is key to balancing the grid because it allows adjustments without delays caused by human error, maximizing the benefit to consumers, said Gregg Dixon, CEO of Voltus, a firm that digitally aggregates power suppliers and consumers into one virtual system to more efficiently balance loads.  According to Henrik Juhlin, head of power management at Vattenfall, one of Sweden’s largest state-owned power companies and a major energy supplier to the HIVE facility in Boden, flexible electricity use is an effective way to support stable frequency in the power grid. Juhlin added that HIVE’s Bikupa data center is one of Sweden’s largest contributors to FCR.  The Swedish national grid operator can call on the HIVE data center in Boden to power down a portion of its mining operations at least once a month to balance the local grid. In the facility, energy use is divided into thousands of small units or machines that can be powered off one by one, or all at once, according to Marin Baksa, site manager at the HIVE Blockchain data center in Boden.

Striking Photos From Siberia to Spain  By comparison, a steel factory, which has to maintain certain temperatures and an assembly line, might have a harder time powering off quickly, Baksa added. Quick responses, like the ones automated crypto mines can bring, are valued higher than slower ones, Dixon said.  Bitcoin miners are willing to curtail their activity for about 100 hours/year, which is when the value of curtailing exceeds the value of mining, i.e., when it’s more profitable to give power to the grid than use it for mining, Dixon said. These can be days when there is really high demand; for example, due to a heatwave.  The miners “can use excess renewable energy locally, to speed up the rate of return on investment, and attract more (clean power) investors,” Lee wrote in an email.  The problem with batteries  Storing electricity instead of using it for mining comes with several caveats, not least of which is that battery technology has been infamously static for the past few years.  In south Spain, energy producers are “not getting very much out of selling electricity to the grid,” said Vincent Burke, CEO of Solar in Spain, which develops small-scale photovoltaic installations.  Burke said that for every three units of electricity he sends the grid, he receives one credit. “So the value of that kilowatt becomes a third of what it is if you use it,” he said, adding that storing extra electricity in a battery is usually expensive because lithium, which is a key material in batteries, is pricey.  “If you don't use the energy that is produced, then you need to store it somewhere,” HIVE’s Baksa told CoinDesk. But “when you create batteries, after the period of expiration of the battery you create a lot of waste. So, not sure that anyone is going in that direction,” Baksa said.  The pros and cons for crypto mining and batteries are different, Webber said.  For energy producers, batteries capture the difference in value between the low and high price. “You charge them up when the price of power is low, and then you discharge your batteries when the price of power is high, so what you capture is the spread between those two prices,” he explained.  By contrast, with crypto mining, “what you want is more or less consistent low power. Ideally, you have really low power all day long and all night long,” Webber said. So where someone places a battery might be the same place for a crypto mine, but maybe not, he said.  Belizaire said mines are, in a sense, better than batteries because they add load instantaneously that can be directly converted into a different asset. “A battery absorbs the electrons and then has to re-output the electrons to the same point where it's connected. It can only do that during certain periods, and sometimes those periods for its business model don't conflict with what the grid needs,” he said.  Howson scoffs at such comparisons. The idea that bitcoin will function like a battery in that miners can act as a buyer of last resort, converting and storing the electricity as “financial energy” is “absolute bollocks,” he said.  The great crypto mining merger  The incentives between energy producers and miners are so aligned that soon it might be difficult to draw a line between the two.  More energy firms are entering mining, while miners are accumulating their own energy supply. Voltus has created models to determine exactly how much flexibility is worth to crypto miners: in Texas, $37.53 per megawatt hour, whereas in New England, it’s $6.69. per MWh.  Read more: ExxonMobil Running Pilot Project to Supply Flared Gas for Bitcoin Mining: Report  Energy companies that stay out of bitcoin mining will leave money on the table, “because mining most of the time is much more profitable than selling the energy to the grid,” Mellerud said.  Based on his research, during mining’s super-profitable 2021, energy producers could have earned more than 10 times the cash flow by mining bitcoin than selling their energy to the grid, he said.  Daro Ruiz, who installs photovoltaics with Solar in Spain, said that although energy prices have increased to $0.14 per kWh for consumers due to the conflict in Ukraine, producers are still paying around $0.05-$0.06 per kWh.  DPO’s Webber said that in five to 10 years, all big crypto miners will have to generate their own power generation capacity to maintain cost competitive operations. “If they don't, the people that own the power gen can do this,” he said.  Belizaire agreed broadly, but stopped short of saying that miners that don’t supply their own power would eventually be priced out. “As the industry scales, and this approach and model starts to take off, it's likely that vertical integration of renewables and this industry will be an important strategic advantage,” Belizaire said.  Working on it  The materials used to build mines are also contributing to the industry’s carbon footprint.  Several miners, which are auditing their carbon footprint, are looking comprehensively at their operations, even as they focus on energy consumption, Morris said. And some are finding ways to save energy in their data center designs, software systems and contracting and financial structuring.  Morris added that most of the criticism of bitcoin’s carbon footprint is a veiled way of saying, “I don't believe in bitcoin.” Decarbonizing the network might not actually satisfy these critics, he said.  Asked whether a fully renewable energy-powered bitcoin mining network would be acceptable in terms of its carbon footprint, Northumbria University’s Howson, a critic of the industry, said that “proof-of-work is proof of waste,” and that “if all the world’s Bitcoiners got together and agreed to cooperate to make bitcoin ‘green,’ it would negate the point of proof-of-work.”  Sweden’s Theéden started his letter calling for a ban on proof-of-work mining saying; “The social benefit of crypto assets is questionable.” For the regulator, the energy going to mining could be better used elsewhere.  Theéden cited research by Digiconomist, a project by Dutch researcher Alex de Vries, who has been a strong advocate against bitcoin mining.  Among other topics, de Vries has quantified the carbon footprint of bitcoin transactions by comparing the energy intensity and carbon emissions of a bitcoin and a Visa transaction. He found that bitcoin’s carbon footprint per transaction is equivalent to 2,700,562 Visa transactions.  The bitcoin community has objected to the comparison and questioned de Vries’s background. Researchers at Cambridge University’s Center for Alternative Finance say that the energy cost per transaction metric is “a purely theoretical measure that has little practical relevance without additional context.” Critics also point out that the researcher works for the Netherlands central bank, which they consider a conflict of interest.  Bitcoin supporters like many of the miners quoted in this article disagree. Mellerud thinks that the debate overall focuses too much on the costs of bitcoin, and that the network has other benefits.  “Yes, bitcoin consumes a lot of energy,” but “this is the price we pay for having a global, permissionless, and censorship-resistant monetary system,” he said.

Crypto companies have traditionally had difficulty accessing banking services. Kraken, should it be granted this access, would be well positioned to serve this market by effectively being treated as a traditional bank.  The American Bankers Association (ABA) recently granted Kraken a routing number, bringing it one step closer to receiving one of the highly coveted Federal Reserve master accounts, which would allow it to deposit funds with the Fed and access the global payments system. Custodia Bank (formerly Avanti) was given a routing number last month.  Kraken, as well as Custodia, is a special purpose depository institution (SPDI), a Wyoming-specific regulatory designation allowing these firms to support digital asset banking activities.  University of Alabama School of Law professor Julie Hill first noted Kraken's routing number on Twitter. She told CoinDesk the ABA had to have issued the number within the last two weeks.  While routing numbers are a critical first step for banks seeking master Fed accounts, the ABA assigning a routing number does not necessarily indicate that a bank will actually receive a master account.  Spokespeople for Kraken did not immediately return a request for comment.  Read more: Caitlin Long's Wyoming Crypto Bank Takes a Step Toward Fed Membership  Last year, the Fed published a request for public comment on a proposal to ""evaluate requests for accounts and payment services"" at Fed banks.  At the time, Kraken Bank CEO David Kinitsky said the Fed's approach was welcome.  According to a notice published last month, the Fed received 46 comment letters and another 281 form letters in response.  The comment letters came from financial institutions (including banks and credit unions) that appeared to oppose expanding Fed master account access, as well as cryptocurrency custody banks and related trade associations that supported the expansion.  In last month's notice, Fed staffers sought to publish a new request for comment that supplemented last year's proposal.  ""The supplemental notice includes a new section of the proposed Account Access Guidelines that would establish a tiered-review framework to provide additional clarity on the level of due diligence and scrutiny that Reserve Banks would apply to different types of access requests,"" the document said.  Federally insured eligible institutions would ""be subject to a less intensive"" review and placed in the first tier.

Of course, it is unknown how much more the price will consolidate. However, the range of prices in the consolidation reaches 500%.
