The growing NFT market could spur an entry by Meta or a competitor. According to Deloitte, the sales of sports NFT will be worth $2 billion in 2022. OpenSea sales can reach more than $24.9 billion. Moreover, its market share of 97% has led to questions about the size of the NFT market. The CEO of OpenSea frequently avoids the spotlight by deflecting questions about the platform&apos;s success. He even demurred when asked about the company&apos;s vision. Alternatively, Zuckerberg is pathologically humble. But despite his humility, the CEO is a proven winner. He has a laser-sharp focus on the company&apos;s priorities and isn&apos;t distracted by the turbulence in the crypto market. The NFT market is highly fragmented, so a leader can easily compete against an alternate destination. Alternate destinations can grow and accumulate sufficient supply in specific categories or specialty features with enough growth. The success of OpenSea will drive capital into the NFT market and create more competition. Meanwhile, new buyers will flood into the ecosystem, driving up the price of the NFTs. By 2023, Instagram could have 2.2 billion monthly active users. And it is estimated that 2% of its users will adopt digital assets. That would be 44 million people, considerably larger than OpenSea&apos;s 1.4 million user base.

This technology generally refers to the use of blocks of data that are generated using cryptography. The data is permanent and normally comprises more information related to the particular transaction or item in question. While normally associated with cryptocurrencies and financial systems, blockchain technology shows promise for its application in many different areas. The legal sector is one of the most unique areas where blockchain technology shows great promise. The use of this technology in the legal system is an application that may not be apparent to many people. However, the use of blockchain technology to store evidence has some practical benefits that may revolutionize the legal system. The use of this system will result in increases in efficiency and transparency. These positive changes result in the general overhaul of the legal system, something that is already in motion in several states around the world such as China, Dubai, and Taiwan.

42374914,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw42m9,1649531561,Former Citi Digital Asset Execs Launch Crypto-Focused Fund,"A trio of former Citi (C) executives formed a crypto-focused investment firm to help clients bet on digital assets.  Motus Capital Management is led by Alex Kriete, Greg Girasole and Frank Cavallo. Kriete and Girasole were previously co-heads of Citi’s digital assets group, while Cavallo was a director and investment counselor overseeing about $8 billion in assets for the bank.  “In order to merge our goal of building the solutions our clients were asking for with our expertise in the crypto space, we left traditional finance to create Motus,” the firm told CoinDesk.  Motus sees an opportunity in the growth segment of the market, where larger investment funds aren’t able to purchase smaller market cap tokens for liquidity purposes, while sub-$100 million funds may “lack the guardrails we want, and economically their main incentive is gathering assets,” Cavallo said.  “We’ve decided not to make trade-offs and instead align interests by putting enough skin in the game ourselves to incentivize both proper fiduciary controls and rightsizing the fund.” For Motus’ growth fund, Cavallo told CoinDesk he’d like it to be around $100 million in size, based on the current opportunity set identified.  Read more: Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Investing in Crypto Fund: Sources  For an income-focused strategy, Motus sees a “mismatch” between funding digital assets versus traditional finance. “Global banks have so much cash they pay zero or less for deposits. Meanwhile, the stablecoin market cap has quintupled since 2021, and investors still command high-single to double-digit returns for dollars or dollar-pegged assets.” Thus, an opportunity presents itself, Cavallo saodd.

The Senate passed its fiscal year 2023 budget early Saturday, which included a provision tasking NYDFS with developing a new “assessment” or charge for the cryptocurrency companies it oversees, to bring its oversight mandate in virtual currencies in line with how the regulator oversees more traditional banks and financial services firms.  The assessments are meant to “defray operating expenses,” according to the text of the budget reviewed by CoinDesk, and are only meant to cover expenses tied directly to the oversight of crypto companies.  “The expenses of every examination of the affairs of any person regulated pursuant to this chapter that engages in virtual currency business activity shall be borne and paid by the regulated person so examined, but the superintendent, with the approval of the comptroller, may in the superintendent's discretion for good cause shown remit such charges,” the text of the budget said.  NYDFS oversees the U.S.’s most developed cryptocurrency regulation through its virtual currency licensing regime, commonly known as the BitLicense. Companies hoping to offer New York residents access to cryptocurrency trading or wallet services must secure a BitLicense before they can set up shop.  In a statement, NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris said the budget would “revitalize our state’s economy and create a stronger New York.”  “The budget includes a new authority to collect supervisory costs from licensed virtual currency businesses, like the Department already does for banking and insurance companies. New York was the first to start licensing and supervising virtual currency companies, and we continue to attract more licensees and the most crypto startup funding of any state in the nation. This new authority will empower the Department to build staff with the capacity and expertise to best regulate and support this rapidly growing industry,” she said.

A striking example of this was the new local fall wave during the trading week on 4 April. In a week, sellers with low volumes were able to absorb the results of buyers for the previous two weeks. The lack of decent resistance and interest from buyers threatens to continue to fall the AVAX price to $70. The test of this mark will determine the further medium-term AVAX price movement. https://www.tradingview.com/x/bj9vCziC/ The fact is that this mark shows the trend line of buyers, which they have been keeping since September 2021. The main task of this trend line is not to allow sellers to organize a deep correction in the AVAX market. From September 2021, we see that buyers are fulfilling this task, but it becomes difficult for them to conquer new local highs. Therefore, the manifestation of the weakness of buyers near the mark of $70 will mean a high probability of continuing to fall to $55. The final target of such a fall wave is $37. At the moment, this is an alternative scenario, as the critical points are now under the power of buyers. However, given the behavior of Bitcoin, such a scenario should be kept in mind.

Compared to other cryptocurrencies, KCS has withstood the blow of correction with dignity and has not allowed sowing panic among investors. However, the KCS price is stuck in consolidation, which can not be chosen. The consolidation range is constantly narrowing and is now $17-$21. In the previous article, we expressed our expectations for buyers to test the upper limit of this consolidation. Buyers were able to implement this scenario and the KCS price stopped at $21. In this range, sellers stop the KCS price for the third time and easily turn it down. https://www.tradingview.com/x/eAfywrKu/ Analyzing the weekly timeframe, we see that the current candle almost overlapped the previous one.

Meet the New ERC-4626 Token Standard ERC-4626 is a newly proposed Ethereum token standard that&apos;s designed to resolve the varying types for tokens in decentralized finance. By adopting the ERC-4626 standard, yield-bearing tokens, for instance, can easily integrate into other DeFi platforms in a more secure way. ERC-4626 provides a standard so that all of these different tokens across multiple blockchains can talk to each other. Ultimately, ERC-4626 can revolutionize the way users and platforms stake their tokens and collect their yields. This will expand the possibilities of the cryptosphere and will become an incentive for financial innovation. According to a Twitter thread posted by Yearn Finance this week, several protocols, including Alchemix, Balancer, Rari Capital, Fei Protocol, and OpenZeppelin, are already planning to implement the finalized ERC-4626 standard. 6/ In a word, ERC-4626 will be the gold standard for any sort of interest-bearing token… from Yearn Vaults to AAVE deposits and Balancer linear pools — yearn.finance (@iearnfinance) April 5, 2022 Yearn Finance Aims to Promote the New Standard Yearn Finance is a popular yield aggregator in the DeFi space which maximizes profits for yield farmers by pla...",POSITIVE,없음,BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ICO | YFI,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/defi-protocol-yearn-finance-adopts-erc-4626-token-standard/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=defi-protocol-yearn-finance-adopts-erc-4626-token-standard,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
