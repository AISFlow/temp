42427709,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL399h,1503349193,$10.4 Million: In-Game Item Exchange DMarket Raises New Funds in ICO,"A blockchain project aiming to create a marketplace for virtual gaming items has raised more than $10 million in an initial coin offering (ICO).  The ICO for DMarket, which began last week, collected 26,935 ETH – an amount worth roughly $8.9 million at current prices – as well as 365 BTC, valued at approximately $1.5 million. And though DMarket's website doesn't list the number of contributors, it states that the sale drew 4,827 transactions over the several-day period.  DMarket is trying to bridge the worlds of blockchain and in-game items – specifically, the secondary market for digital assets in which gamers swap loot for money. That billion-dollar market has been targeted by more than a few entrepreneurs, who see the market for in-game items (as well as any other digital “things” that can be passed from one owner to the next) as an area of big growth looking ahead.  Social media posts suggest that DMarket's sale progressed largely without incident. However, a series of tweets indicates that members of the project's Slack channel were targeted by phishing attacks.  Security threats have honed in on other blockchain projects – particularly those that have conducted an ICO or preparing for one. Earlier today, members of the Slack channel for the Enigma project were tricked into contributing funds to a false ""pre-sale,"" resulting in more than $500,000 in losses.  DMarket is planning to conduct a second token sale, which is set to take place in November. According to data from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker, the successful raise brings the total amount of funds collected through the ICO model – in which cryptographic tokens are sold to users as a way to bootstrap a network – one step closer to the $2 billion mark.

42427730,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL39hh,1503339305,Bitcoin Cash Wins Mining Power as Price Falls Back Below $600,"Bitcoin may be winning the battle for investment dollars, but when it comes to attracting mining power, competition is heating up.  After the bitcoin cash blockchain experienced a major adjustment this weekend, the less than one-month-old cryptocurrency has seen a dramatic reduction in mining difficulty, and perhaps more crucially, an increase in its profitability for those providing computing power as a means to secure its ledger.  At press time, bitcoin cash has now attracted nearly 30% of the mining power of the bitcoin network, a figure that is up from just 5% two days earlier.  As profiled by CoinDesk last week, the move sets the stage for a high-profile, real-time test of how two large blockchain markets might compete at scale. As both bitcoin cash (BCC or BCH) and bitcoin (BTC) use proof-of-work to secure their transaction histories, both networks are now effectively competing for hash power.  So, while bitcoin cash may have struggled to produce blocks after the split (miners initially earned less money), that has now changed.  As of last Friday, bitcoin miners are now earning more through the creation of new bitcoin cash, as developers and miners have worked to lower the bitcoin cash difficulty rating that regulates its rewards.  What happens from here is less clear given that there are few comparative events from which to draw historical information.  The most similar event, last summer's ethereum hard fork, had several notable differences in that both networks very much wanted to continue building in separate directions. Bitcoin's split, by contrast, has been more competitive.  Already, there is suggestion that there might be a larger fight over the bitcoin branding should one blockchain prove more popular. And it remains to be seen how exchanges would respond to such an event in their listings.  Further, the two markets appear to be divorcing from ideological motivations, with many bitcoin and bitcoin cash users and traders showing a propensity for taking profit wherever it's being made available.  At press time, bitcoin cash is trading at just under $600, though its price had been as high as $1,000 this weekend, largely on anticipation of scheduled mining changes.  The result is a sign that bitcoin cash may be responsive to developments in hash power changes, or at least, the expectation of those changes. By contrast, bitcoin has seen more stability to these fluctuations, largely trading in the $4,000 to $4,500 range over the last several days.  Miners for hire  But while price action has been subdued, the event still might mark a turning point in the relationship between the two competing cryptocurrency networks, which emerged following a years-long disagreement on how best to upgrade bitcoin's technology.  Bitcoin cash, created in August, boasts 8 MB transaction blocks, while bitcoin is soon set to activate Segregated Witness, a code optimization that will increase capacity as well as redefine how capacity is counted by the distributed network.  Still, miners so far appear to be setting up to profit from the competition between the two networks in their quest to appeal to users.  In recent days, BTC.Top, the fifth-largest mining pool, and AntPool, the network's largest mining pool, have both given the independent miners that use their software the option to dedicating their computing power to both networks.  Some are now going a step further, with ViaBTC and AntPool indicating they are or will soon begin working on technology that will enable miners to direct their computing power to whichever chain is offering the most profits.  For now, markets will likely be watching to see whether other miners follow suit.

42400281,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJDib,1503336881,Take Two: Bitcoin Miner BTCS Announces New Merger Deal,"The publicly traded bitcoin miner BTCS is moving toward a new merger, public records reveal.  New filings  with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show that BTCS has signed a non-binding letter of intent with Blockchain Global Limited. Blockchain Global, according to the filings, operates a bitcoin mine out of China and also runs an Australian bitcoin exchange called AXC.io.  The firm also invests in other companies in the bitcoin and blockchain space, perhaps most notably the publicly-traded DigitalX. Earlier this year, Blockchain Global notably invested in DigitalX through a convertible loan denominated in bitcoin.  The merger effort is the second for BTCS, which moved to merge with bitcoin miner Spondoolies-Tech back in 2015. Yet despite being cleared by a key regulator in Israel, where Spondoolies was based, the deal ultimately fell apart after an Israeli court dissolved the firm amid financial problems.  It also comes as BTCS looks to shore up its financial position, having raised $1 million earlier this year in a bid to stem the tide of losses. Issues aside, representatives for both BTCS and Blockchain Global struck positive notes in statements announcing the deal.  ""The blockchain space continues to suffer from a talent void. Together with BCG, and their track record of success, we’re positioning ourselves to fill this talent void, ultimately capitalizing on the immense opportunity in blockchain technologies and leveraging our early-mover advantage,"" Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, said of the planned merger.

42400285,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJDgd,1503330012,ICO Scammers Steal $500k in Phony Enigma Project Pre-Sale Launch,"As much as $500,000 in ether has been stolen from supporters of the Enigma blockchain project following a security compromise.  According to a statement from the Enigma team, those involved in the thefts were able to take control of the project’s website domain, one of the administrator accounts on its Slack channel and its mailing lists. Once in control, according to reports on social media, those involved began masquerading as the official team and distributing solicitations for an initial coin offering ""presale.""  The team said in a statement earlier this morning:  ""At this time, the Enigma team has retaken control of all compromised accounts, including the website. Some pages will remain deactivated for the time being while the team works. Please continue to be vigilant and check our communications across ALL channels. Do not send any money or personal information to anyone.""  The fake solicitations took place via Slack and email. According to a copy of the email obtained by CoinDesk, the scammers cited ""enormous support"" behind the launch of the ""presale"", and included a link to the then-compromised Enigma website.  TechCrunch reported that nearly 1,500 ETH (roughly $500,000 at press time) had been deposited in the fake Enigma address before the team was able to regain control over the affected domain. That address has since been all but emptied, network data shows.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Enigma aims to create a decentralized hub for information needed by fast-moving cryptocurrency hedge funds (though the plan is to create a broader market for data in the long-term). The team previously indicated that it would launch its initial coin offering (ICO) next month, though it’s unclear whether this security breaches will affect that timeline.  Other ICO supporters have been caught up in security problems in the past. In early July, as much as $7 million was diverted to a false address during the CoinDash ICO, prompting the team to shut down their website amidst the sale.

42400286,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJDlY,1503325825,Credit Suisse Eyes 2018 Launch for Blockchain Loans Platform,"A group of banks led by Credit Suisse is eyeing the launch of a commercial platform for blockchain-based syndicated loans, according to reports.  Speaking to finance magazine EuroMoney, Emmanuel Aidoo, who leads Credit Suisse's blockchain efforts, said that syndicated loan trial – which began last fall – is moving ahead.  Aidoo told the publication:  ""We are working to put a few dozen smaller loan transactions, where we or other participating banks are the agent, onto a distributed ledger platform using smart contracts in production next year.""  The group involved finished the second phase of their testing in March. Conceptually, the test envisions a syndicated loan market – in which multiple lenders pool their capital for individual borrowers – built on blockchain. The group hopes the technology can reduce barriers between counterparts, reducing both time and cost in making the necessary capital available.  Using smart contracts to reduce those turnaround times could increase the market's appeal to potential lenders and investors, according to Aidoo.  ""Many investors, including mutual funds and institutional asset managers, might be attracted to loans that are senior to bonds in the capital structure, but they are put off by how long loan trades take to settle,"" he said.

42400271,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJDbi,1503320408,A Bitcoin Law for Every State? Interest and Animosity Greet Model US Regulation,"A two-year effort to unify cryptocurrency business regulations across the U.S. has concluded – now, the technology's enthusiasts just have to convince legislators to enact it.  Established in 1892, the Uniform Law Commission ( ULChttp://www.uniformlaws.org/) is a non-profit association made up of 350 commissioners. All are lawyers by trade, and their goal is to draft legislation that brings clarity to areas where state law is creating instability.  Given the onerous regulatory regimes that have so far been enacted for cryptocurrencies, it may be no surprise that the ULC has taken an interest in the area. Since the group began its work in 2014, attempts by states to regulate the tech have attracted everything from public boycotts to criticism and petitions to ongoing lawsuits.  But with the ULC's work now concluded, some industry observers are optimistic this narrative could see a much-needed reversal.  Stephen Middlebrook, an attorney with Womble Carlyle who served as the American Bar Association advisor to the ULC during its drafting process, expects several states to introduce its Uniform Regulation of Virtual Currency Businesses Act in upcoming legislative sessions around the country.  Middlebrook told CoinDesk:  ""It's my understanding that legislators in several states who were interested in legislating in this area held off waiting for the Uniform Act. So, I think there's sort of a built up demand for it.""  Appeals for clarity  Others involved with the work agree.  Sarah Jane Hughes, who served as reporter for the ULC committee, said Texas and California – which were involved in the drafting process – would likely be early adopters.  ""We believe that there are a number of states that have been holding back their own regulatory and legislative approaches in order to wait for this,"" she said.  The Uniform Act seeks to spell out which virtual currency-related activities are – and are not – considered money transmission, and therefore require licensure. It further defines foundational concepts such as the ""custody"" of crypto assets.  One of the more innovative items the bill seeks to put into law is a three-tier licensing structure that offers full exemptions for individuals and small entities, creates a regulatory sandbox for startups and grants full licensure status for larger virtual currency businesses.  And legislators seem keen to continue engaging and working with the nascent industry.  Matt Dababneh, a member of the California state assembly who has introduced virtual currency legislation in the past, told CoinDesk he is considering the Uniform Act, explaining:  ""I have been monitoring the growth and progression of virtual currency and how it impacts our economy. I am still reviewing all of the recommendations put forth in the [Uniform] Act. I will continue to be engaged in this issue as virtual currency becomes a more prominent payment option for businesses throughout the state.""  Industry threat?  With all this optimism, though, there's still an uphill battle ahead.  According to Carol Van Cleef, a fintech attorney with BakerHostetler, getting the law passed in any single state, much less all 50, will be a challenge. And there's history to prove it.  About 17 years ago, a uniform money transmitter statute was circulated, with the idea that money transmitters would only need to receive a license from one state, which could then be used as a passport to operate in other states, said Van Cleef.  ""As of today, I think approximately 10 states have adopted that. So, we're not going to see this as a real panacea, or think that we’re resolving the state money transmitter issue,"" she said at a conference last month in Washington, D.C.  Complicating matters further, a segment of the virtual currency community remains stridently opposed to the Uniform Act on the grounds it too closely resembles New York’s ""BitLicense"" regulation, which they claim has chased fintech innovators out of the state.  The Bitcoin Foundation, a non-profit of waning influence in the industry, has urged the National Council of State Legislatures (NCLS), a group that represents state legislators and staff, to direct its members to reject the bill.  Writing to the NCLS, the foundation's executive director Llew Claasen warned:  ""Adopting a model act with the characteristics of the New York regulation is sure to threaten the existence of the fintech industry nationwide.""  Seeking balance  And there might be merit in these ideas.  Given the fast-moving nature of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, laws like the BitLicense have shown a propensity to quickly become dated.  Since the law was drawn up in 2014, two separate movements have sprung out of the tech: bank-focused private blockchains and initial coin offerings – both of which haven't been addressed on the state level.  Still, Middlebrook advocated for a balance here, as both regulators and innovators seek to find a middle ground that can perhaps only be found with time.  He concluded:  ""The choice really is whether it's going to be regulated using statutes and regulatory schemes that were designed for other things that don’t really mesh well with virtual currency, or whether a regulatory scheme is going to be something specifically designed for businesses operating in this area.""

42400279,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJDdg,1503316807,Swift's Cross-Border Blockchain Trial Is Moving Into Its Next Phase,"Swift is one step closer to adopting blockchain.  After months of work, a team of developers at the inter-bank payments platform have completed a proof-of-concept built with the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. Designed to test whether moving member bank accounts to a distributed ledger could help Swift reconcile in real time, the project is now ready for its next phase.  According to Damien Vanderveken, head of Swift's distributed ledger technology R&D effort, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, DBS Bank, RBC Royal Bank and Wells Fargo have now been given access to the platform for further testing.  If successful, Swift believes the tests could free up billions of dollars in dormant funds in banks' nostro accounts, which are set up all over the world to hold various currencies just in case they're needed for transactions. By moving the funds to a shared ledger, the test is seeking to confirm whether that practice can be eliminated, freeing up the capital to be invested in other ventures.  Going forward, the founding banks are expected to complete their work next month, at which time the results will be validated by an additional 22 banks, including ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered.  Skepticism remains  While a small update, news that the test is moving forward nonetheless has notable implications for both Swift and blockchain adoption in banking more broadly.  For one, even in spite of multiple blockchain efforts in various stages of development at Swift, the organization remains publicly skeptical of the technology.  This has been especially true as it relates to real-time payments, where Swift is expanding its services using traditional payment rails even while startup Ripple takes aim at financial incumbents with its distributed ledger model for instant payments.  Here, Vanderveken echoed Swift's customarily incredulous tone, concluding that such developments aren't necessarily prompting concern in the organization.  Vanderveken concluded:  ""Blockchain is very hyped, that is for sure, and whether blockchain drives innovation, I think it only drives innovation in payments. But does it drive it for instant payments? I wouldn’t say so.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

42400284,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJDkZ,1503302407,Hints and Rumors? How Ripple Might Really Enter China's Market,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and the author of CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to CoinDesk subscribers.  In this opinion piece, Acheson discusses one of the industry's best-funded startups, Ripple, and how it might seek to enter the Chinese market.      When word started circulating last week that Alibaba might be running a Ripple validator node, a key question emerged – could this be the blockchain company's road into China?  The answer, it seems, is both yes and no. While Ripple denied the rumors, it did confirm that it was looking to break into the Chinese market.  On the surface, neither statement is surprising. Of course, Ripple wants to break into China. Any fintech-related business would, given its massive size and high connectivity. And if Alibaba (or, more likely, a division) were running a node, it would make sense to keep quiet about it to avoid a speculative frenzy that would push up the price of the token, which could in turn affect the terms of any deal.  The thing is, just because Alibaba isn't running a node, doesn't mean that the companies aren't talking.  In fact, a partnership between Ripple and Alibaba makes a lot of sense – and not just for the two companies that would be involved.  How Ripple benefits  For Ripple, a San Francisco-based startup that has raised nearly $100 million to disrupt global messaging consortium Swift, the target is tempting.  As China's push into global trade intensifies, so do the pain points for cross-border payments, including capital controls, fast-changing regulation and relatively high costs. What's more, the strong growth of China's cross border e-commerce – now at almost 20% of total foreign trade – further fuels demand for cheap and fast currency flows.  Forging a relationship with any of China's large banks, however, will be tricky, given the heavy influence of the state and its reluctance to involve foreigners in its financial system. An affiliation with one of the internet giants, with their technology-first focus and their access to a sizeable user base, would be a much more efficient entry into the market.  Yet, while the large internet companies have their own financial arms (and could be considered banks), their businesses are largely consumer-facing, while Ripple’s operations revolve around bank-to-bank transfers.  However, CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently said that he expected Ripple to break into the consumer market within five years.  Where better than the largest consumer market in the world? A partnership to explore more efficient clearing in one division could be just the tip of the iceberg.  What Alibaba gains  Given Alibaba's sprawling structure and global ambition, blockchain technology has potential applications in many areas of its business, and in-depth work is already going on.  Of all the conglomerate's businesses, however, it is perhaps affiliate Ant Financial that offers the most obvious short-term opportunity for Ripple.  In a recent interview, its CEO confirmed that it is looking into blockchain technology to underpin Alipay, which dominates China's $5.5 trillion mobile payments sector.  Another potential focus of collaboration could be Alibaba’s electronic global trading platform, announced last year. Starting with Malaysia, the aim is to forge a network of bilateral links between China and sovereign trading partners, facilitating logistics, negotiating favorable tariffs and (take note) providing a platform for cross-currency electronic payments.  Where regulators might stand  But, other parties could also emerge as champions of such a deal. For example, moves by the Chinese regulators reveal an urgent need for transparency.  Last week  , the People's Bank of China mandated that all third-party mobile payments be cleared through a central platform by next June, to allow greater access to payment data and to keep an eye out for illicit movements.  This trend is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future – on the contrary. It does, however, add layers of cost that a blockchain platform could mitigate.  Ripple's solution could offer a means of settlement that bypassed central clearing, while still allowing the regulators to monitor flows.  Given the obvious strategic benefit, it is likely that the main parties involved are at least talking. Whether cultural, economic and technological barriers can be overcome, however, is another matter.  Should exploration go ahead, it would be a big step forward in blockchain development globally. It would also boost cross-border transactions… and relationships.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.
