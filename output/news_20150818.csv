42398610,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJ6p,1439925726,SEC Sues Brother of GAW Miners CEO Amid Investigation,"UPDATE (18th August 22:10 BST): This story has been updated with additional information.      The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed suit against a former employee of the now-defunct cryptocurrency mining company GAW Miners.  Carlos Garza, according to a 14th August filing, has allegedly refused to comply with a SEC subpoena in connection with its long-running investigation into GAW Miners and CEO Josh Garza. The law enforcement agency is investigating whether GAW violated securities law through the sales of its Hashlet mining products as well as the sales of the cryptocurrency paycoin.    The SEC is also investigating whether the company operated a Ponzi scheme.    According to the filing, Carlos Garza – the brother of GAW CEO Josh Garza who was primarily involved in the sales of mining products and paycoin to investors – appeared to give testimony on 12th August but refused to answer questions.  Investigators want to question him, the filing states, because of his knowledge of the company's inner workings and the process by which it sold Hashlets and paycoins. Garza was sent an initial query letter on 30th July.  The filing notes:  ""The Commission subpoenaed Garza to testify on Wednesday, August 12, 2015. Garza appeared for testimony but refused to answer any questions. Garza also failed to produce any documents requested in the subpoena, including a document he had earlier represented that he would produce.""    A court transcript shows that Garza told the SEC during testimony that he did not understand securities law and was afraid to respond to queries at the time without a lawyer present. Garza also refused to answer basic questions about himself, according to the text.    The SEC asked Judge Richard Stearns to require Garza to either show cause for why he can't comply with the subpoena, or provide the mandated testimony and provide ""all non-privileged documents in his possession, custody or control responsive to the Commission’s subpoena"" by 4th September.  The court granted the SEC its request on 17th August.  GAW CEO Josh Garza did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Details into investigation  The initial filing offers direct details of the agency's investigation into GAW Miners and its CEO Garza, which focuses on both issues related to Hashlets as well as paycoin. The company's mining service was scuttled earlier this year and at the time of press paycoin was trading at $0.025 cents.  GAW is also embroiled in several civil legal challenges, including a dispute with a Mississippi electric utility that ended last week with a default judgment after the company failed to appear in court.  Of note is the investigation's inquiry into whether GAW Miners' mining service was a Ponzi scheme, as investigators are looking into whether the company sold ""far more Hashlets worth of computing power than the company actually had in its computing centers"".  The filing states:  ""In particular, the Commission is investigating whether GAW Miners may have sold far more computing power than it owned and dedicated to virtual currency mining, and therefore, whether the company may have owed investors a return that was larger than any actual return it was making on its mining operations.""  ""If GAW Miners did not have actual mining operations, that allowed it to earn the daily mining payout that it owed to Hashlet investors, then the payouts that investors received could only have been a gradual repayment over time, as 'returns,' the money that they and others had invested,"" the filing continues. ""As a result, some investors’ funds may have been used to make payments to other investors.""  The SEC is understood to be one of several US agencies investigating GAW. According to sources with knowledge of these efforts, state-based regulators are also conducting investigations into the company.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story.

42398598,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcIxy,1439912728,Judge Approves Fraud Claims Against Bitcoin Mining Firm HashFast,"A US District Judge has approved claims against bankrupt bitcoin mining company HashFast and two of its officers.  Judge Edward Davila, responding to a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants, sided with plaintiff Pete Morici by approving the claim that HashFast violated the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) – which prohibits ""acts or practices which are unlawful, or unfair or fraudulent"" – and additional allegations of fraud.  Morici alleges that he purchased two Baby Jets – bitcoin mining hardware devices – worth $11,200 of bitcoin from HashFast but failed to receive his order as promised and was not offered a satisfactory refund.  The order signed by the judge read:  ""Based on the foregoing discussion, the court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently pled a UCL claim against Barber. The court also finds the fraud claim sufficient insofar as it is based on statements Barber made regarding the Baby Jet shipping date and the availability of refunds in bitcoin.""  However, Davila, dismissed claims against Barber for statements that described whether the Baby Jets were in stock.  Venkat Balasubramani, Morici's lawyer told CoinDesk the lawsuit would now proceed to complete the period of discovery and deposition, and if necessary, trial.  When reached, attorney Jeremy Gray of Zuber Law, which originally represented HashFast in the suit, said that it had not represented the bankrupt company ""for a long time"" and declined to comment further.  Long battle  The plaintiff filed suit against the HashFast Entities and its officers Simon Barber and Eduardo deCastro last year, submitting a complaint for breach of contract and fraud.  Speaking to CoinDesk at the time, deCastro said that HashFast's delays were due to a series of problems encountered in the ASIC production process. Contention at the time also revolved around the fact that the disgruntled bitcoin miners were requesting that their refunds be paid out in bitcoin.  HashFast was granted Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June last year. Prior to that, the company let go of many of its staff in a seeming attempt to remain solvent.

42398614,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJ9m,1439897446,Filament Nets $5 Million for Blockchain-Based Internet of Things Hardware,"Filament has raised $5m in Series A funding led by Bullpen Capital and including contributions from Verizon Ventures and Samsung Ventures.  The decision by Samsung Ventures, the capital arm of consumer electronics giant Samsung, marks its first public investment in a blockchain industry firm and notably follows its participation in IBM's blockchain proof of concept ADEPT.  Announced in January, ADEPT used the bitcoin and Ethereum networks to enable devices to communicate as part of a wider transition toward connected consumer devices known as the Internet of Things (IoT).  Co-founder and CEO Eric Jennings framed Filament as a decentralized IoT software stack that uses the bitcoin blockchain to enable devices to hold unique identities on a public ledger. By creating a smart device directory, he said, Filament's IoT devices will be able to securely communicate, execute smart contracts and send microtransactions.  Given this vision, Jennings sees his project as similar in ethos to ADEPT, even though it will target the industrial market, enabling large firms in industries such as oil, gas, manufacturing and agriculture to unlock new efficiencies.  Jennings told CoinDesk:  ""Almost all these companies have the same concern – 'What is my IoT strategy?' Many of these companies are good at what they build but they don’t have a lot of expertise in mesh networking or blockchains, but they know they need to connect these networks to gain efficiencies or risk going out of business.""  Filament will seek to market two hardware units: the Filament Tap, a sensor device that allows devices to communicate with phones, tablets and computers at distances of 10 miles, and the Filament Patch which extends the capabilities of the technology to custom hardware projects.  By leveraging its blockchain-based technology stack, Filament said enterprise companies can better manage physical mining operations or water flows over agricultural fields without relying on centralized cloud alternatives or pen-and-paper methods that result in human inefficiencies.  Founded in 2012, Filament was originally conceived as Scout, a wireless home security system built on mesh networking, before rebranding as Pinocc.io. After being accepted into the Techstars incubator last October, the company reemerged as Filament with a new focus on industrial use cases for connected devices.  Crosslink Capital  , Digital Currency Group, Haystack, Working Lab Capital and Techstars were also part of the Series A fundraising. With the funds, Jennings said Filament aims to scale its team from 15 to 30 employees, as it moves toward rolling out its hardware devices in Q4 2015.  Open standard approach  Behind this technology, Filament boasts the inventor of the communications protocol Jabber/XMPP Jeremie Miller as its CTO. Launched in 1999, Jabber was an open standard alternative to chat applications such as AOL Instant Messenger.  Support for the protocol was eventually adopted to varying degrees by Facebook, Google and Microsoft, a success Filament aims to replicate with its platform.  ""The lesson is that decentralized systems are more valuable to the company and the people that use them,"" Jennings explained. ""That’s the ethos we’ve learned, that decentralized systems with more equal footing between the users tend to be more valuable.""  Filament's thesis is based on seeking to unlock how a similar platform can be used to enable decentralized communications between connected devices, a vision Jennings argues is based in business logic rather than any ideological support.  ""Decentralized isn't a tinfoil hat position,"" Jennings argued. ""Decentralized systems are more valuable to people that interact with them... It's a good reminder. 'Why it does it matter using the blockchain?' because it can make systems more powerful and more valuable.""  Filament's technology stack will use five layers – blockname, telehash, smart contracts, pennybank and BitTorrent. Filament's sensors rely on the first three in order to operate, while the final two protocols are optional for clients.    Hardware and technology stack  The Filament Tap is the smallest unit offered by the company, which it aims to sell in units of 10 to those interested in testing the product's capabilities.  Among the products benefits, according to Jennings is ease of use. ""Taps have sensors so they can be attached to devices in an office space and be up and running in 20 minutes. They can start monitoring infrastructure immediately,"" he said.  Each device will be equipped with the ability to handle communications on all five of the company's protocols. Using blockname, devices are able to create a unique identifiers which are stored in a part of the device's embedded chip and recorded on the blockchain. Telehash, in turn, provides end-to-end encrypted communications and BitTorrent enables file sharing.  ""In the blockchain, when the devices are manufactured, we store the unique hash of a network address. When we manufacture our devices, we create a unique global IP address and in blockname, we store where those hashes can be resolved,"" Jennings said. ""If device A wants to talk to device B, blockname will tell them how.""  Payment for the devices' use is handled by smart contracts, which allows the terms of payment and access to the device to be controlled programmatically.  Jennings sought to stress that Filament's products and technology are blockchain agnostic, but they currently use the bitcoin blockchain. Jennings said data for contracts is stored using the 40 bytes of extra data added to bitcoin transactions.  Jennings described Filament's PATCH product as the ""brain of the Tap"", which would be integrated into other hardware devices and stacks but use the company's technology.  Supporting microtransactions  Of the five planned parts of the company's stack, Jennings acknowledges that IoT micropayments, or the ability of devices to transact, remains in the earliest stages.  Filament will use a bitcoin-based protocol that it has developed called Pennybank for microtransactions on its platform, in part because of its unique needs. ""Our devices are not high power and they aren’t always online, so in order to allow these devices to transact, they can’t be a lightweight wallet,"" Jennings said.  Effectively, Jennings said Pennybank creates an escrow service between two devices, allowing them to settle transactions when they are connected online.  Jennings suggested early talks with clients lead him to believe enterprise firms want to pay on an ongoing, real-time basis. Here again, he suggested the only way to satisfy this market demand was by using blockchain technology.  The ability for Filament devices to transact, he said, is also crucial to ensuring the network remains viable even if the company closes. Further, he suggested it would open up new opportunities for clients, who could sell their device data to others in a similar way.  ""That’s the beauty of bitcoin and the blockchain in a lot of ways, you can’t go and change things, it’s established and locked in. If clients ask 'Are you going to be around in a year or two?', having the ability to answer that is a big sales benefit,"" he said.  Still, Jennings sees Filament's role in the IoT ecosystem as connecting devices and parties but owning the smart contracts by which they interact.  He concluded:  ""Our value is not the software stack. It would be like saying the value of the bitcoin codebase, the value is having the private keys to your coin, that’s what you want to keep secret. We get the code out there, we leverage it and add value to the contracts.""

42398608,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJ4r,1439894918,Destinia: Bitcoin-Paying Customers Spend More on Travel,"Bitcoin-paying customers spend €16 ($18) more on average per transaction than those paying with credit cards, according to Spanish online travel agency Destinia.  This year, customers paying with bitcoin have spent an average of €377 ($477), in comparison to an average of €361 ($400) being spent by credit card paying consumers, according to a spokesperson for the company.  Despite receiving bitcoin payments on an almost daily basis, the spokesperson said there had been a slight decline in the number of transactions since integration in early 2014.  The Destinia spokesperson said it was difficult to determine the reasons behind this decrease, but cited greater industry competition – Expedia began accepting bitcoin for hotel bookings last summer – and the digital currency's price decline as possible factors.  ""Despite all of this, we are delighted with the way in which this payment method [bitcoin] is performing and we foresee a lot of potential,"" the spokesperson said, adding:  ""Last year bitcoin was mostly used for paying for hotel reservations, this year we have noted a significant increase in bitcoin payments for flight bookings ... currently, sales for both are pretty levelled.""  Destinia's most active bitcoin customers, the spokesperson concluded, are in Spain, Germany, Argentina and Sweden.  Just yesterday, the online travel agency announced it now also accepts bitcoin for low-cost flights.

42398619,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJDi,1439887834,Why and How Banks Should Embrace Blockchain Tech,"William Mougayar is a Toronto-based angel investor and four-time entrepreneur who advises startups on strategy and marketing. In the first of this three-part series, he discussed how banks dealt with the emergence of the Internet and how blockchain technology is causing these institutions a whole new headache. Here, in part two, he looks at why and how banks should start embracing blockchain technology.    Build on-ramps, not barriers    Banks can’t really pick and choose a small subset of use cases and claim they are embracing the revolution. If you use “blockchains without bitcoin” just to avoid public blockchains, you will be subjected to a huge market blind spot because there are millions of users that want to trade with bitcoin, and you’ll be insulated from them.      Bitcoin’s adoption does not seek permission from any bank or government. The cat is already out of the bag, and a new parallel financial environment is forming around it and other cryptocurrency-related technologies, powered by networks of computers that secure it, validate it, enforce it and run it.      If financial services were to be re-invented today from scratch, we would be fine with virtual, online, Internet and blockchain-enabled services. There would be no traditional bricks and mortar branches.      Instead of visiting a branch, we would do a video call with a remote service representative who can verify our identity, and it goes from there. Technically speaking, bitcoin, blockchains and their related ecosystem can replicate a bank today without much difficulty, both for consumer retail banking and business-to-business services.      Truth is, there will be pressure from consumers who are already getting a taste of freedom from banks via alternative FinTech services. Blockchain-enabled solutions will take that freedom bar even higher via decentralization, peer-to-peer behaviors, and by putting more power at the edges of the network directly in the hands of users, or by granting more processing power at the nodes of the computing networks and software applications.      It’s very possible that startups in the blockchain space will also be chiseling at the banks’ business, just as dozens of successful FinTech startups have already dissected and unbundled many banking services.      Banks risk being on the outside looking in, if they don’t build on-ramps and exits to the new world of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, they risk becoming islands themselves.    No more warnings from bankers    We don’t need to hear warnings from banking executives about not using bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. In 1995, several banks and financial institutions issued warnings about Internet payments and online commerce as not being safe. Then, a few years later, they all adopted online services and allowed Internet payments. Today, Amazon is bigger than Walmart in market value.      We don’t need to hear that cryptocurrencies are high-risk, because of anonymity, or other factors, just because banking executives don’t fully understand them yet, or because the banks are not yet ready to adopt them.    Business drives technology    We need to remember that “business drives technology choices”, and not the other way around. Business people need to understand technology’s possibilities, and technologists need to better explain what the technology can do.      Only when the two come together with a harmonious understanding will we see real innovations come to life. The opportunities rest on what you make with all existing technologies, based on your willingness to make changes inside your business.      Blockchain Apps are being built to handle the next generation of services in trade settlements, digital ownerships, assets ownerships, assets transfers, origin verification, title transfers, and many other areas.      Here’s a proposed evolution of key application areas, depicting the various touch points and target segments. The broad categories of attention are in consumer services, B2B services, trading and capital markets, back-end processes, and inter-industry services.      There is a lot of work needed to bring this vision to reality. For example, inter-banking co-operation over new networks will not be easy, but it will be done. And reengineering efforts must be taken seriously.        Note that this segmentation is not splitting the market along permissioned (private) vs. permissionless blockchains (public), because that type of demarcation is a technical one.      In reality, there will be a continuum of blockchains, and they will interconnect or interrelate to each other, just as databases do today, in the background, without us knowing about their technical intricacies. So, this is not about blindly ruling out public blockchains in favor of private ones. Rather, you may need to think about using both scenarios, depending on what’s best for each use case.    Putting crypto-tech on the strategic agenda    Where do you start? There are various approaches to get there from an enterprise implementation point of view. Corporate teams need to work with external players and technologies, and many of them are new and in early developmental stages.      Most vendors and technologies have less than a dozen clients at the most, and some have less than a handful. So it is early days for sure, but there is no shortage of innovation. However, the banks must meet these startups half-way by dreaming-up how to apply their technology.

And there are new advances pertaining to making it easier to implement decentralization stacks without worrying about building or assembling all of the required pieces from scratch.  Some of the progress being made is equivalent to the evolution from building websites manually using HTML code in 1995 to automagically creating sites today using WordPress and via a few configuration steps.  For example, Ethereum takes care of the complexities of writing decentralization applications so that developers can focus on the desired functionality, and not the intricacies of networked and decentralized peer-to-peer technologies.  Look out for part three in this series, coming soon.  This article originally appeared on Startup Management, an edited version has been reposted here with permission.
