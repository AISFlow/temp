16126452,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547520,1692226832,"Can Ethereum Price Cross $2,000 Before The End Of August?","The Ethereum price has been on a rather disappointing run for investors over the last month and this decline has seen it fall to the low $1,800s. As the onslaught continues, the question now is will Ethereum be able to cross the $2,000 resistance before the month runs out? ETH Open Interest On The Rise One interesting factor about the current trend for the digital asset is the rate at which open interest is growing. Now, during times of falling prices where long traders are suffering the most in the market, open interest tends to decline as traders start to pull back from bullish positions. However, that has not been the case lately. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Similarly To 2019 And 2020? As data from Coinglass shows, the Ethereum open interest has been on the rise lately. This growth trend is evident across exchanges, a number of which saw a significant jump in their Ethereum open interest. For example, in the last day, the ETH open interest rose 16.77% on CoinEx, 14.48% on OKX, and 13.08% on Bitget. It doesn‚Äôt end there as the likes of Huobi and Binance also saw an 8.15% and 5.94% increase in their ETH open interest, respectively. ETH open interest on exchanges jumps 5.98% in 24 hours | Source: Coinglass As a result of this, the total exchange ETH futures open interest in USD moved from $6 billion last week to $6.54 billion on Wednesday. Given that the ETH futures open interest across exchanges was sitting at $6.4 billion on Tuesday, it translates to a 5.98% jump in total open interest in the last 24 hours alone. What Does This Mean For Ethereum Price? The steady rise in the Ethereum futures open interest on exchanges could point to a coming halt in the price decline. This is because, despite the falling prices, investors expect the price of the cryptocurrency to keep rising, which means bullish sentiment has not waned. What the current trend points to is likely a case of investors selling off holdings to secure some profit. But with so much open interest, it means there is not a lot of runway for the sellers. As a result, they will run out of steam soon and buyers will take over the market once more. Related Reading: Base TVL Surges 900% In 2 Weeks, What‚Äôs Driving The Growth? When this happens, it would not take long until the Ethereum price is back up once more. Pulling above $2,000 will be more of a hurdle though.

ETH bulls hold $1,800 support amid decline | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com However, with the expectations of an Ethereum ETF being approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), there could be more volume flowing into the asset soon.

Comparing HUT's mining efficiency and Bitcoin production with peers reveal room for optimization and growth. The upcoming halving (est. April 2024) could create the need for higher Bitcoin prices to sustain mining operations. Introduction I have previously written a recap on crypto mining stocks - Marathon Digital ( MARA ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) - this month, and both analyses show similar challenges crypto mining companies face, which include lack of profitability, the effects of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) price volatility, mining difficulty which abruptly affects the cost of revenue, and other operational expenses. Hut 8 Mining Corp. ( HUT ), a Canada-based crypto mining company that operates several digital asset mining facilities and High Performance Computing ((HPC)) data centers across Canada, just released its Q2 earnings . In this analysis, I'll delve into HUT's mid-year performance and the outlook for the coming months, explore the strategic moves Hut 8 is making to navigate the current challenges, and compare the stock to other crypto mining stocks to gauge its valuation. Q2 Recap Q2 proved to be a testing period for Hut 8. In May, the digital asset mining company faced electricity-related issues at one of its mining facilities in Alberta, Canada, leading to a drop of 75% in the installed hash rate at the facility; this, coupled with the increase in mining difficulty, caused the amount of Bitcoin mined to drop by 58% YoY. Hut 8 mined a total of 399 Bitcoin in Q2 this year compared to 946 Bitcoin mined in Q2 2022. Hut 8's Bitcoin-producing capacity was also impacted by suspended mining activities at one of its mining facilities. The low mining output had an impact on the company's finances. HUT reported total revenue of C$19.2 million, representing a decrease of C$24.6 million YoY. No EPS surprise for Q2; the reported EPS value of -$0.06 is in line with the consensus estimate. Unsurprisingly, HUT reported a net loss. The company lost C$16.7 million in Q2. This is however an improvement over the C$88.1 million lost in Q2 2022. Reporting a value of C$(2.7 million) for adjusted EBITDA is also an improvement over Q2 2022 adjusted EBITDA of C$(98.1) million. Strategic Moves Made in Q2 To smooth mining operations, HUT revealed that it implemented a new firmware across its miners. The firmware regulates the power output capacity and keeps the miners within safe power limits. Some other notable moves the company made in Q2 include: Securing a Credit Facility: Hut 8 secured a loan of up to $50 million with Coinbase Credit, a subsidiary of crypto exchange Coinbase ( COIN ). The loan will help HUT hold its Bitcoin stash until the next halving, giving the company interim financial flexibility. The company anticipates a crypto bull run following the next halving scheduled to occur around April 2024. ""It ensures that we can maintain our dynamic Bitcoin treasury management strategy going into the halving,"" HUT's CEO affirms. The strategy of holding a stash of digital assets (while sourcing funds from other sources) in anticipation of a future price increase is risky, in my view. An increase in the price of Bitcoin and other crypto assets, although likely, is not guaranteed, and is largely based on speculation. HUT is one of the top public companies with the most significant Bitcoin reserve. At the end of Q2 HUT had 9,136 Bitcoin held in reserve, of which 8,289 Bitcoin remain unencumbered. The company has only sold part of the BTC it mined in 2023, and continues to hold Bitcoins it mined before 2023. Gaining Clients for its HPC Business: Hut 8's strategic diversification is becoming evident as the company expands its scope beyond Bitcoin mining and takes its data center business seriously. In Q2, there was an agreement between HUT and Interior Health, a Canadian health authority, to provide high-performance computing services to the health authority. I think HUT stands to gain from this diversification. HUT could capitalize on the growing demand for data center solutions, especially in the fields of AI, data analytics, and rendering, as the popularity of artificial intelligence and rendering continues to rise. This expansion not only strengthens HUT's market presence but also highlights its adaptability and readiness to leverage emerging opportunities beyond the realm of crypto mining. Of the C$19.2 million revenue in Q2, C$4.2 million (~21%) came from its HPC business. Working Towards a Strategic Merger: Hut 8 is progressing toward a merger with US Bitcoin Corp. ((USBTC)), which holds the potential to reshape Hut 8's operations and capabilities. The merger involves expanding Hut 8's self-mining capacity, as indicated by the amended S-4 registration statement with the SEC. The combined company will become a U.S.-domiciled entity. Where Does HUT Stand Among Mining Peers? A Bitcoin mining company's financial growth and profitability are largely based on the number of blocks won in the competition for block rewards and the cost of producing a Bitcoin. Hence, mining companies constantly upgrade hardware (for improved hashrate) and explore efficient energy and cooling options. An important aspect of their financial reporting entails highlighting the progress made in hashrate scaling, savings on energy cost, number of Bitcoins mined, cost of mining a Bitcoin, and total Bitcoin held in reserve. These factors greatly influence their financial statements. Data as of Q2 2023 HUT MARA RIOT Hashrate (EH/s) 2.6 17.7 10.7 Number of Bitcoin Mined 399 2,926 1,775 Number of Bitcoin Held 9,136 12,964 7,275 Data culled from each Q2 report by Author Based on the data in the above table, I'd firstly like to gauge how efficient HUT's mining operation is, in comparison to its peers, in terms of hashrate and the amount of Bitcoin produced using this simple formula: Mining Efficiency = Bitcoins Mined / Hash Rate. Based on this formula HUT's mining efficiency is 399 Bitcoin / 2.6 Eh/s = 153.46 Bitcoin per exahash (EH/s). Marathon Digital scores 165.39 Bitcoin per exahash and Riot Platforms scores 165.42 Bitcoin per exahash. This gives a simple yet profound overview of HUT's resource optimization and operational strategy. Based on this calculation, both Marathon and Riot mine ~11.9 more Bitcoin per exahash in comparison to Hut 8. The number of Bitcoins mined per exahash reflects how efficiently a company utilizes its hashing power to generate Bitcoins. On the one hand, the above metric reveals HUT's lower operating efficiency when compared to MARA and RIOT. HUT has faced operational challenges, which have impacted its operating efficiency. On the other hand, the lower amount of Bitcoin produced per EH/s demonstrates that HUT could potentially optimize its operations to enhance its capacity. In simpler terms, there is significant room for growth. I am optimistic because of the ongoing merger of equals with USBTC and the prospects for HUT8 in this arrangement. USBTC is set to host 150,000 mining rigs for top US mining companies, including Marathon Digital. I believe that HUT would benefit from USBTC's extensive network of managed hosting facilities, as well as the options of utilizing green power in the US. As USBTC will be providing hosting services for MARA's rigs, HUT will have the advantage of adopting the same technology stack utilized by MARA. This alignment will ensure that HUT is on par with MARA in terms of technological capabilities, and probably in Bitcoin produced per exahash. Analysts expect better earnings for HUT, evident in its Forward P/E of 12.37x, which is considerably lower than the sector median of 26.13x. HUT's EPS estimate for FY2023 is $0.21, while RIOT's expected EPS FY2023 is -$0.99, and MARA's is -$0.35. Risk There are some risks to consider when holding a mining stock like HUT in your portfolio. Bitcoin Price Volatility When crypto prices rise, mining companies like HUT can generate higher revenues from the sale of mined coins. However, during periods of price decline, revenues can decrease, impacting the company's top line. Also, mining operations require significant upfront capital expenditures for hardware and infrastructure. Volatility can impact HUT's ability to plan and allocate resources effectively. This is why mining companies are seen raising cash from financing by borrowing or issuance of new shares, which leads to debt obligations and stock dilution. Upcoming Halving and Mining Difficulty The upcoming Bitcoin halving (estimated to occur around April next year) will reduce the block rewards in half. Bitcoin halving events are closely associated with changes in mining difficulty. By then, Bitcoin will need to trade at a much higher price for mining companies to stay afloat and not incur a loss on each mined Bitcoin. Conclusion Comparing Hut 8 to its mining peers reveals insights into its efficiency and growth potential. While Hut 8's operating efficiency might currently lag behind some peers, the lower amount of Bitcoin produced per exahash presents the company with room for optimization and expansion. The pending merger with USBTC would reshape Hut 8's capabilities, and I believe the company will leverage technological advancements that will align it with the industry leaders. The crypto mining sector remains tied to Bitcoin price volatility; it is crucial to monitor events and developments closely if you hold this stock in your portfolio.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4629068-hut-8-q2-performance-and-outlook?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/16124989.jpeg

42419745,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFi05,1692222000,Shiba Inu‚Äôs Ethereum Layer-2 Blockchain Shibarium Goes Live Amid Push for DeFi Growth,"Shibarium hopes to lure users to a low-fee ecosystem focused mainly on financial services and gaming.  The Ethereum layer-2 network will utilize BONE, TREAT, SHIB and LEASH tokens for applications built on the blockchain, which could lift the prices of these tokens as demand increases.  Shiba Inu developers on Wednesday were set to push live the much-awaited Shibarium blockchain, an Ethereum layer-2 network that uses SHIB tokens as fees, a representative told CoinDesk.  Layer 2s are networks built atop a layer 1 blockchain ‚Äì in this case Ethereum ‚Äì and designed to provide faster and cheaper transactions for users. Shibarium joins an increasingly crowded blockchain landscape; there are at least 50 other networks hoping to lure users with low fees to an ecosystem focused mainly on financial services and gaming.  Shibarium is part of a broader plan to position Shiba Inu as a serious blockchain project. Its popular SHIB tokens, themed after the Shiba Inu dog breed and inspired by Dogecoin, were issued in August 2020 and quickly became one of the largest meme coins by market capitalization.  But developers are now giving its tokens more utility by way of the Shibarium network, seeking to become a player in decentralized finance, or DeFi.  The network will utilize BONE, TREAT, SHIB and LEASH tokens for applications built on the blockchain, which could lift the prices of these tokens as demand increases.  Shibarium is said to have a focus on metaverse and gaming applications especially as the NFT sector is expected to heat up in the coming years, apart from the network‚Äôs use as a cheap settlement for DeFi applications built atop it.  A ‚ÄúDoggyDAO,‚Äù a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) run and governed by token holders, will be introduced at the time and used to fund projects building on Shibarium.  The popularity of SHIB tokens ‚Äì evidenced by some 21 million wallets created during a testing phase ‚Äì could mean Shibarium quickly sees brisk network activity after going live.  ‚ÄúMany in the tech world, inside and outside the blockchain ecosystem, are promising ‚Äòeverything apps‚Äô and full user interactivity in the world of ideas, goods, services and other opportunities,‚Äù said Shiba Inu lead developer ‚ÄúShytoshi Kusama‚Äù (a pseudonym), in a message to CoinDesk.  ‚ÄúHowever, any such promise absolutely must start at a place of both community and decentralization,‚Äù the developer added. ‚ÄúAs part of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the planet, Shibarium lives at the intersection of those two principles in a way that eludes most other technologies, even many other blockchains.‚Äù  Shibarium is a proof-of-stake blockchain, relying on validators and delegators. Validators run nodes, process transactions and create new blocks, ensuring the operation and overall security of the ecosystem.  Delegators, meanwhile, support validators by staking ecosystem tokens. Both validators and delegators are rewarded for their participation in this ecosystem with a governance token called BONE, which has a total supply of 250 million.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | SHIB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/16/shiba-inus-ethereum-layer-2-blockchain-shibarium-goes-live-amid-push-for-defi-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c2d96640d60016c120b51845b6a487f06cbe27c-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The former president and leading Republican candidate for next year‚Äôs election held $2.8 million in a cryptocurrency wallet as of early August, according to official documents governmental ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington received Monday.  He also earned $4.87 million in licensing fees from his non-fungible token collection, per the filing.  The new finding shows that Trump is even more invested in crypto than earlier filings showed. CoinDesk reported earlier this week that Trump disclosed up to $500,000 held in digital assets according to a government document dated April 14.  Trump, despite being a crypto skeptic when he was president, last year debuted a non-fungible token (NFT) project called Trump Digital Collectible Cards sporting images of himself. He released a second series of collectibles this April. Both collections sold out.  The news also comes at a time when cryptocurrencies are increasingly part of the political agenda in the U.S. as candidates are gearing up for the presidential election due in 2024. Democratic hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who confirmed owning bitcoin (BTC), said he would back the U.S. dollar with BTC and exempt the token from capital gains taxes if elected.

Lee expressed optimism that introducing a Bitcoin ETF could propel the digital asset to price levels of $150,000 or even $180,000, representing a significant surge from current levels. Optimistic View On BTC Lee‚Äôs bullish stance on the potential for a Bitcoin ETF to drive price appreciation reflects the growing anticipation within the cryptocurrency community, as an ETF would provide traditional investors with a regulated and easily accessible vehicle for gaining exposure to Bitcoin, potentially attracting substantial capital inflows into the market. According to Lee, if the SEC were to approve a Spot Bitcoin ETF, it could unlock a new wave of investor interest and significantly boost the price of Bitcoin. He estimated that this approval could drive the cryptocurrency to $150,000 or even $180,000, representing a substantial appreciation from its current levels. The endorsement of a regulated ETF would likely instill confidence among institutional investors who have hesitated to enter the cryptocurrency market due to concerns about custody and regulatory oversight. Related Reading: SEI Token Breaks Into Top 100 One Day Post-Debut On Major Exchanges However, Lee also acknowledged the influence of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event on the price trajectory. Bitcoin‚Äôs protocol is designed to undergo halvings approximately every four years, reducing the block reward miners receive by half. Considering the impact of the halving, Lee tempered expectations of Bitcoin reaching six-figure prices in the immediate aftermath. While he expressed confidence in the long-term potential of the digital asset, he suggested that the effects of the halving might delay the realization of such high valuations. Bitcoin Holds Critical Zone Amidst Intensifying Bull-Bear Battle While continuing to experience a consolidation phase and decide which side will crack first, Bitcoin has found itself in a critical zone, prompting both bullish and bearish sentiments among market participants. Keith Alan, co-founder of the analysis firm Material Indicators, has highlighted vital indicators and technical levels that are currently shaping the market‚Äôs direction. While the bears actively seek to test support and potentially trigger a macro bear market, the bulls have maintained the trading range thus far, keeping the macro bull market prospects alive. The significance of maintaining the range cannot be understated. According to Alan‚Äôs analysis, key Moving Averages and the green resistance/support (R/S) Flip Zone have demarcated critical levels that Bitcoin must hold. As BTC‚Äôs price approaches the lower end of the range, below $29,000, Alan closely observes the technical support at the 21-Week Moving Average, as a breach of this level could have far-reaching implications for the overall market sentiment. According to Keith, a break below the range and the subsequent formation of a Lower Low (LL) in price action would signal the onset of a macro bear market. This would imply a prolonged period of downward price pressure and a potential shift in the broader market trend. Related Reading: Is An XRP Spot ETF Coming To The US Soon? Bloomberg Analyst Answers Conversely, a successful defense of the range, coupled with a clearance of the 100-Week Moving Average and the formation of a Higher High (HH), would indicate the potential for a macro bull market characterized by sustained upward momentum. Despite the bearish signs of ‚Äúprice erosion‚Äù and diminishing liquidity, the bulls can still find solace in the fact that they are currently holding the range. This suggests that the market is yet to tip in favor of the bears decisively. However, the bears remain determined to test this support, making it a crucial juncture for determining the near to mid-term trend of Bitcoin.

42419746,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFhvx,1692214926,How PayPal Upended the Crypto Debate in Washington D.C.,"As the end of July arrived, House Financial Services Committee Republicans achieved its goal of passing a bipartisan stablecoins bill. Still, they left D.C. without the broad bipartisan vote Chair Pat McHenry had labored to achieve. The session ended with new recriminations over old disputes, namely the degree of federal vs. state regulation in a new regulatory framework, casting a dark cloud over the prospect of legislation that could garner support from McHenry, Ranking Member Maxine Waters, and the Biden White House.  John Rizzo is Senior Vice President for Public Affairs at Clyde Group. Rizzo most recently served as the Senior Spokesperson at the U.S. Department of the Treasury where he led public affairs strategy on digital assets, among other issues.  And then PayPal and Paxos entered the chat. The surprise unveiling of PYUSD may be the accelerant needed to forge compromise in D.C. and bring about the legal enshrinement of a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. It may also represent a new, more aggressive strategy for how American fintech companies deal with the federal government and D.C. regulators.  To understand why PYUSD‚Äôs launch is so monumental, one must recognize that it comes from one of the world‚Äôs largest digital payment companies, which boasts 430 million accounts. With the flip of a switch, hundreds of millions of users can access and transact in stablecoins through a service with which they are already familiar. It will speed up crypto adoption and make the ecosystem more challenging to bring to heel through Congressional action.  The prospect of a significant market participant exploring a stablecoin project is a dynamic I observed up close while serving as a senior spokesperson at the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2021 and 2022. Those years saw the federal government attempting to implement a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins in the backdrop of Diem, Meta‚Äôs stablecoin project‚Äôs failure during the summer of 2021 (when it was announced, the project was known as Libra and Meta was called Facebook).  Read more: David Z. Morris - PayPal‚Äôs Real Stablecoin Strategy: It Wants to Earn Interest on Your Deposits  Had it succeeded, Diem would have presented two challenges, which were discussed publicly at the time, for the federal government to wrestle with. Libra‚Äôs stablecoin would have launched when the U.S. lacked a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, meaning it would exist in a legal and regulatory gray space. And, while that reality would pose a challenge to the federal government, other stablecoin projects have and will exist in the same regulatory gray space. What was different about Diem was that its regulatory challenge would have been turbocharged by the fact that Facebook‚Äôs billions of users would have had access to this sort-of-regulated, sort-of-not-regulated crypto token overnight.  PayPal is not Meta/Facebook, but the prospect of hundreds of millions of users soon having easy access to a stablecoin on a platform they already use and are comfortable with creates a new urgency for lawmakers in D.C. to reach a compromise on a regulatory framework for stablecoins. That didn‚Äôt exist when just a handful of Democrats voted in favor of Chair McHenry‚Äôs stablecoins bill.  Before PYUSD‚Äôs unveiling, the stablecoin market was somewhat steady, consisting of the same players and similar levels of adoption. Hundreds of millions of PayPal users will soon have a crypto asset closer to their fingertips. Democratic policy makers in D.C. who resisted McHenry‚Äôs stablecoins bill in search of a better deal must account for the prospect that stablecoin adoption and usage could speed up rapidly soon, heightening some of the risks that D.C. policymakers identified when assessing stablecoin regulation.  The legislative calculation isn‚Äôt the only equation that has changed for Democratic policymakers after the unveiling of PYUSD. The regulatory calculation has also changed, potentially ushering in a new era of how American crypto market participants engage with D.C.  Read more: PayPal‚Äôs Regulated Stablecoin Is ‚ÄòWatershed Moment‚Äô in Crypto  According to reports, Libra‚Äôs stablecoins project backers extensively sought D.C. policymakers' approval before launching its token. On paper, it made sense. Unlike transportation policy, which Uber and Lyft showed can be changed by the force of will and mass adoption, financial services are highly regulated at the federal level. Forcing financial policy innovation without the pre-approval of regulators is daunting unless you operate in the one area of financial services primarily regulated by states.  That‚Äôs PayPal‚Äôs ace in the hole. It‚Äôs the reason it could partner with Paxos Trust and change the pool of potential stablecoin users overnight. Its core business, money transmission, is regulated through a state-by-state licensing regime, meaning the federal government‚Äôs ability to impose a cost on PYUSD‚Äôs backers for launching a stablecoin without seeking prior approval is limited.  The lobbying strategy for PYUSD may herald a somewhat new approach to D.C. by American crypto companies. Instead of asking permission, they‚Äôre demanding a seat at the table and bringing with them potentially hundreds of millions of users who will speed crypto adoption and make stablecoins a part of everyday economic life.  Achieving a result in D.C. is not always about winning the competition of ideas. Instead, influencing policy is about power and leverage  Having observed power up close during 14 years of federal service between Congress and a presidential administration, achieving a result in D.C. is not always about winning the competition of ideas. Instead, influencing policy is about power and leverage. More often than not, those who have it get their way in D.C., and those who don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt.  Supporters of stablecoins and market participants now have leverage over the federal government, including regulators and lawmakers, in a way that didn‚Äôt exist weeks ago. It could grease the wheels for a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins in Congress and begin an era in which American crypto companies force the federal government to deal with them on their terms.",POSITIVE,PYUSD,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | PYUSD,John Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/16/how-paypal-upended-the-crypto-debate-in-washington-dc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9175c2f08a33087f0fdf5835da08fde6e7955b3-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This Metric May Suggest So,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has spiked, a sign that the whales may be selling now. Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Has Gone Up In Recent Days An analyst in a CryptoQuant post explained that the whale inflows have been higher than usual recently. The ‚Äúexchange whale ratio‚Äù is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 inflows to exchanges and the total exchange inflows. Generally, the ten most significant transactions going to exchanges are coming from the whales, so this ratio‚Äôs value can provide hints about how the inflow activity of these humongous investors currently compares with the entire market. When the value of this metric is high, it means that this cohort is making up a significant part of the total market inflows. As one of the main reasons investors deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this trend can be a sign that the whales are currently applying a large amount of selling pressure. On the other hand, low values imply the whales are making up for a relatively healthy portion of the total inflows. Depending on other market factors, such a trend may be neutral or bullish for the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price. Related Reading: This Dreaded Candlestick Formation Just Printed: Bitcoin To $18k? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio over the last couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have hit a high peak in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant The above graph shows that the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has recently registered a spike. In this latest surge, the metric had neared the 0.70 mark, implying that almost 70% of the total exchange inflows had come from these humongous investors alone. If these whales have made these deposits to sell their coins, then BTC could naturally feel a bearish effect from this inflow activity. So far, however, the price hasn‚Äôt seen any significant decline, as it continues to be within the range it has been endlessly consolidating for the past few weeks. Related Reading: Renowned Finance Author Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $1 Million If This Happens In the chart, the quant has also highlighted the instances during the last couple of years where the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio spiked to similarly high values. It would appear that the BTC price declined shortly after most of these occurrences. In some instances, the bearish effect only occurred with a delay, meaning that even though the recent spike hasn‚Äôt led to a significant price drawdown, it could still do so soon. It remains to be seen how the Bitcoin market copes with this potential high selling pressure from the whales this time.

42419743,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFhz3,1692207496,"Sei, Blockchain Designed for Trading, Goes Live but 'Frustration' Mounts Over Airdrop","Sei, a new trading-focused blockchain backed by Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital, went live Tuesday, setting off a flurry of trading for the project‚Äôs just-launched SEI token and pushing its first-day market capitalization to more than $400 million.  Trading volume for SEI has topped $1.6 billion in the past 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap, with major crypto trading venues like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken all listing SEI in tandem with the network‚Äôs debut.  However, posters on X (formerly Twitter) lobbed complaints about apparent delays in the token‚Äôs hotly-anticipated airdrop ‚Äì a planned giveaway of tokens to early users and community members.  The team behind Sei initially said in a blog post that ""the airdrop will open for claiming at Public Mainnet launch."" When the network launched on Tuesday, however, users were unable to claim tokens ‚Äì fueling discontent and confusion among early Sei adopters eager to claim their share.  The status of the airdrop remained vague in the 24 hours following Sei's mainnet launch. In an X post on Wednesday ‚Äì a day after the network's launch ‚Äì Sei Labs clarified that ""airdrop rewards will be claimable following an initial warmup period,"" but it failed to provide a concrete timeline. It wasn't until later that day ‚Äì after the SEI airdrop had already been dubbed a ""fiasco"" by some observers ‚Äì that the airdrop claim process ultimately opened to users.  By then, the incident had already come to illustrate the messiness inherent to crypto airdrops: a popular, albeit problem-prone method for attracting network users.  Application-specific blockchain  Sei is a new network built using the Cosmos SDK ‚Äì a so-called software development kit that can be used to easily construct new blockchains that are interoperable with other networks in the Cosmos ecosystem.  In April, Sei Labs, the main contributor behind the Sei blockchain, raised $30 million of funding, for a valuation of $800 million.  The organizing principle behind Sei is that it‚Äôs an application-specific network; unlike general-purpose blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum that have evolved to support a range of use cases, Sei is designed with a special focus on speed, low fees, and other features specially tuned to support certain kinds of trading apps.  Sei co-founder Jeff Feng said in an interview that the focus will be on social platforms, gaming and carbon credits.  ‚ÄúEvery single successful application in crypto right now is either directly or indirectly a trading application,‚Äù another co-founder, Jay Jog, told CoinDesk TV on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWhat we observed is that trading applications built on-chain right now, they just cannot scale. And rather than keeping iterating on exchange-mechanism design, we think the solution is a fundamental rewrite of the underlying infrastructure.‚Äù  Sei airdrop  Sei‚Äôs mainnet deployment came alongside the official announcement for an ‚Äúairdrop‚Äù of the SEI token, the asset that will be used for network fees and proof-of-stake security. Airdrops are a popular method for blockchains to attract users and bootstrap liquidity ‚Äì rewarding some allotment of a network‚Äôs tokens to early adopters and network testers.  Although airdrops have become a mainstay of the blockchain-launch playbook, they're almost always marred by legal, operational, and technical snafus. The SEI airdrop was no exception.  The SEI airdrop, according to Sei Labs, was configured to allow users of popular blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain to claim an allotment of SEI tokens upon ‚Äúbridging‚Äù assets over to the new network ‚Äì an incentive scheme designed to lure over users from these incumbent platforms. Users of Sei's test network were also poised to receive a provision of SEI tokens.  After Sei Labs announced its official plans for a SEI airdrop ‚Äì some users found issues claiming their allotment of tokens and reported trouble understanding the exact eligibility criteria. Users have also had difficulty accessing Sei's official Discord server ‚Äì the messaging platform that community members use to interact and share updates. Sei's Discord appeared to go offline starting on Tuesday and CoinDesk was still unable to join it at press time.  Asked about airdrop delays on the CoinDesk TV interview, Jog said, ‚ÄúThat is not really something that I can comment on from my side.‚Äù  'Frustration'  On Wednesday, around five hours before the SEI airdrop ultimately opened to users, a Sei Foundation spokesperson wrote in an emailed response to questions from CoinDesk: ""The airdrop is not delayed. While many assumed the airdrop would occur on Mainnet launch, token dispersals are handled by the Sei Foundation, which has never specified the timing of the airdrop.""  The criteria for eligibility for the airdrop will be available when it happens, wrote the spokesperson.  ""While the Sei Foundation is aware the community's frustration due to the misunderstanding about the connection between the mainnet launch and the Atlantic rewards and airdrop, we encourage the community to remain patient as we wait for the final ecosystem partners and globally distributed validators complete their work to ensure their decentralized applications function smoothly for the Sei community on mainnet beta launch,"" the spokesperson said.  The spokesperson also addressed the Discord drama: ""The Sei Foundation decided to limit channels due to increased spam and fraudulent links in the official discord as a result of the excitement around mainnet beta launch.""  According to Sei Labs, 40% of the circulating supply for SEI has been set aside for its team and private investors. Some 48% of the supply of the token is set to go toward ecosystem reserves ‚Äì which includes initiatives like the airdrop and other incentive programs. The rest of the supply will go towards the SEI Foundation (9%), and Binance launchpool incentives (3%).  UPDATE (August 16, 23:01 UTC): An earlier version of this article was posted before the SEI airdrop went live.

The announcement comes as the bank remains deep in the throes of liquidation while battling multiple lawsuits linked to its demise. Top Executives Set to Step Down Silvergate Capital Corp announced on Tuesday, August 16, the departure of some of its primary employees working in executive leadership positions in its company. The executives leaving include Chief Financial Officer, Antonia Martino, Chief Legal Officer, John Bonino, and CEO, Alan Lane. Related Reading: Another Crypto Millionaire Has Been Found Dead Lane and the company‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer will be departing on Tuesday, August 16, and according to a financial filing delivered to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Silvergate‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer is set to step down on September 30. The executives‚Äô decision to depart from Silvergate follows the bank‚Äôs announcement in March to shut down operations and liquidate its assets. Lane has served as the CEO of Silver Capital Corp and Silvergate Bank since 2008 and played a pivotal role in Silvergate‚Äôs development and growth. In the absence of a CEO, Silvergate has replaced Lane with Silvergate‚Äôs Chief Transition Officer, Kathleen M. Fraher. It has also made Andrew Surry, Silvergate‚Äôs Accounting Officer, the principal financial offer in the absence of Martino. Silvergate stated in the filing to the SEC that it will provide each executive severance benefits previously offered to employees laid off through the bank‚Äôs liquidation process. Earlier this year in January, Silvergate laid off over 180 employees, cutting its workforce by 40%. Again, in May, the bank laid off over 250 workers, leaving a group of about 80 to oversee its liquidation and termination process. The San-Diego-based bank said in a report that it plans to significantly reduce the number of employees in its company and manage its operations using a skeleton crew. Stock price falls from $20 to $0.2 | Source: Silvergate Capital Corporation on Tradingview.com Silvergate Enveloped in Lawsuits and Liquidations In November 2022, Silvergate collapsed following the FTX failure and embroilment in fraud. Silvergate, which served as one of the two major banks for cryptocurrency companies in the industry, decided to officially shut down all operations and start a liquidation process. As a result, stocks plunged by 36% and the bank suffered massive customer withdrawals. Toward the end of Q3, Silvergate‚Äôs total deposits from crypto customers plummeted by 68%, declining to $3.8 billion from an astonishing $11.9 billion. Related Reading: US Prosecutors Accuse FTX‚Äôs Sam Bankman-Fried Of Using $100M To Curry Political Favors According to reports, FTX was one of Silvergate‚Äôs major customers and it was revealed that Silvergate held about $1 billion in deposits from FTX at the time of its failure. Silvergate‚Äôs affiliation with FTX has caused severe financial damage to the bank‚Äôs reputation and put it on the radar of the regulatory authorities in the United States. Silvergate was also mentioned in multiple lawsuits due to its association with the bankrupt FTX and allegations of participation in FTX‚Äôs fraudulent activities.

The company said customers who have previously purchased crypto assets through their PayPal account can keep them on the platform or sell them at any time. However, starting Oct. 1, the ability to make new purchases will be disabled.  ‚ÄúWe're taking this measure in response to new rules enacted by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that require crypto firms to implement additional steps before customers can purchase crypto,‚Äù PayPal said in a statement.  Britain‚Äôs financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is introducing stricter measures against money laundering through the use of crypto to align with the Financial Action Task Force's ""Travel Rule"" on Sept. 1.

42419738,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFhsr,1692202669,The End of the End of Crypto,"Trying to figure out whether crypto is here to stay isn‚Äôt as simple as tallying up the industry‚Äôs wins or losses. For a while there it genuinely seemed possible that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could wipe crypto off the map (maybe with the help of other government agencies).  Then again, there‚Äôs practically a cottage industry of people who‚Äôve made it their business to count all the times Bitcoin or crypto supposedly died. And, as sure as we are the sun will rise tomorrow, Bitcoin will likely keep adding blocks to the chain. That‚Äôs induction, baby!  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Without speaking out of step, it seems like the overall mood of the crypto scene has shifted. Last week the ‚ÄúGreed & Fear‚Äù index for measuring sentiment in bitcoin markets flipped bullish. Beginning with BlackRock‚Äôs surprising move into the realm of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and running through PayPal‚Äôs just-launched stablecoin, it seems like most of the major crypto news headlines are pointing a way forward.  Ripple Labs didn‚Äôt exactly win its long, long legal battle with the SEC, but the part it didn‚Äôt lose could be significant for token issuers going forward. Industry ‚Äúvillains‚Äù seem to be getting some comeuppance with Sam Bankman-Fried being thrown in the clink and the Three Arrows Capital jabronies getting sued.  So is the bottom in? That‚Äôs not really for me to say. But, now that the SEC has finally unloaded its worst against sector giants Binance and Coinbase, FedNow didn‚Äôt siphon off all interest in crypto and meaningful legislation has passed never-before-seen hurdles, it seems like the worst is over yet.  Sure, there are still many long term risks to crypto: proposed ‚Äúcustody rule‚Äù changes could put crypto into a hostage situation, CoinDesk‚Äôs semi-estranged parent Digital Currency Group‚Äôs bitcoin trust could unravel and quantum computers could one day break cryptography‚Äôs back. There‚Äôs likely plenty of tail risks and black swans and bitter ends ahead.  Just yesterday the New York Times published an article essentially calling the end of people who call the end of crypto. At this point, it seems clear enough now that Bitcoin is battle-tested, and, while governments may want to step up oversight of crypto, the real anarchic core to all of this is basically untouchable.

Here‚Äôs what this could mean. Investors Of Bitcoin & Other Top Coins Are Capitulating Currently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the current trader capitulation that the largest assets in the market are seeing may be a bottom signal. The indicator of interest here is the ‚Äúratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss,‚Äù which, as its name already implies, tells us how the profit-taking volume for any given coin compares with its loss-taking volume right now. When this metric has a positive value, it means that the profit-taking volume is higher than the loss-taking volume currently. Thus, such a trend implies that the market as a whole is harvesting profits at the moment. On the other hand, the indicator having negative values suggests loss taking is the dominant behavior among the traders of the cryptocurrency in question right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Prediction: Crypto Analyst Forecasts New ATH by 2024 ‚Äì Can It Happen? In the context of the current discussion, the assets of relevance are Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA). Here is a chart that shows the trend in the ratio of transaction volume in profit to loss for these assets over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been negative for all these assets in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the indicator‚Äôs value for all these top assets has dipped inside the negative territory recently. This high loss realization from the investors has come as the market as a whole has been unable to amass together any significant rally. From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that these assets have seen the investors capitulate at different points throughout the year, but the current capitulation event has an interesting feature that was missing from these previous instances: the loss-taking is currently happening for all these large cryptocurrencies. It would appear that traders as a whole have finally started to give up on the market after experiencing endless consolidation, as they are ready to take losses in order to make their exit. The scale of the loss-taking itself is also extraordinary, as the only other time this year that the loss volume overtook the profit volume to this degree was way back in March. Historically, capitulation from investors has made bottoms more probable to form. And from the above chart, it‚Äôs visible that the March capitulation also leads to Bitcoin hitting a bottom. Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin‚Äôs Market If Greenlit The likely reason behind this pattern is that the investors who exit in losses are generally the weak hands, who had a low conviction in the asset, to begin with. In capitulation events, the coins that they sell at losses are picked up by the more resolute investors, and hence, the market gains a stronger foundation for building up rallies. It‚Äôs possible that the high loss taking that Bitcoin and the others are experiencing currently may also lead to a bottom, if the historical precedence is anything to consider.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization sank to as low as $28,930, the weakest level since August 7 and down from $29,400 a day ago. The price had bounced modestly to just over $29,100 at press time.  ‚ÄúBitcoin still struggles to find any directional momentum as prices remain glued to $29K,‚Äù Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at digital asset firm K33 Research said in a report.  Ether (ETH) also slumped, changing hands at around $1,820 , losing 0.8% over the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is lower by 1.7%.  Alongside the bearish action Wednesday came a wildly bullish prediction from the oft-bullish Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors. Appearing on CNBC, he said approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could see the price jump more than five-fold from current levels.  ‚ÄúI think the demand will be greater than the daily supply of bitcoin, so the clearing price [...] is over $150,000, could even be $180,000,‚Äù Lee said.

It‚Äôs now lower by 4.7% over the past 24 hours and 19% over the past month.  ‚ÄúCurrent price action is marked by unusually low volatility, low levels of leverage and speculative activity,‚Äù Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at investment manager VanEck, said in an interview with CoinDesk TV. ‚ÄúFalling volatility has been a trend for much of the past year despite the extreme events which led to the bankruptcy of every major crypto lender.‚Äù  Interest rate worries persist  After being updated with the latest economic data, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is now forecasting 5.8% U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter.

Also Wednesday were the release of the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's July meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

42419757,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFiAP,1692200700,Why Crypto Investors Should Care About Tokenomics: Crypto Long & Short,"One important consideration for any digital asset investor allocating money to alternative coins is tokenomics. For the uninitiated, tokenomics refers to the economic and financial aspects of a cryptocurrency or project‚Äôs ecosystem. It encompasses the design, creation, distribution and management of the native tokens used within the project. Tokenomics plays a crucial role in shaping the economic value of tokens and the incentives of token holders within the protocol‚Äôs ecosystem. It involves careful considerations across various interdisciplinary fields, from economic principles, agency problems and game theory to oracle problems and blockchain architecture tradeoffs.  You‚Äôre reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  In short, tokenomics effectively defines the utility, monetary policy, distribution and incentives of the project‚Äôs token. Done well, tokenomics can be a supporting pillar in creating a thriving and valuable ecosystem. Done poorly, it can create a zero-sum money game or worse ‚Äì a system teetering on the brink of instability (see algorithmic stablecoins).  One aspect of tokenomics that is particularly important for investors who exit the heavily traveled digital asset highway of bitcoin and ethereum to take the scenic altcoin backroad is token issuance. Issuance is typically done to raise capital for various purposes, such as funding expansion, reducing debt or investing in new projects.  When a project issues new tokens, digital asset investors need to consider the following:  Dilution of Ownership: When new tokens are issued, existing owners get diluted, resulting in a decrease in the ownership percentage and control that existing token holders have in the project. To the extent that the initial distribution of tokens favored the initial project investors and founding team, this effective change in control can be minimal relative to community token holders. This dilution impacts the explicit or implicit value per token, as ownership of the future utility from the project is spread across more units. Whether or not the project‚Äôs total market value increases or decreases depends on the use of the capital proceeds raised.  Use of Proceeds: If the funds raised are used to finance growth and strategic initiatives for the protocol or ecosystem, this can enhance the token‚Äôs future value and utility. But suppose investors are more critical of the use of capital as there doesn‚Äôt appear to be an immediate need or plan for investment, or they view the issuance as a liquidity event and exit for protocol founders or early investors. In that case, this can be viewed as a negative event.  Related to the two factors above, we must also consider the asymmetric information and agency problems between protocol development teams and token holders. Like traditional corporate management teams, protocol teams have private information and a potentially more realistic outlook for their projects than later-stage token holders. As investors in the secondary market, we should assume protocols are subject to ‚Äúmanagerial market timing.‚Äù  Managerial market timing refers to project insiders, particularly founding team members, making token transactions based on their perception of the protocol‚Äôs token price movements. For instance, if insiders believe their protocol‚Äôs token is undervalued and set to rise, they might increase their holdings. On the other hand, if they anticipate a decline in the token‚Äôs price, they might decrease their holdings. As digital asset token markets continue to be shrouded in regulatory uncertainty, investors need to be aware of the actions of the protocol‚Äôs founding team, especially if it seems to be in conflict or misaligned with the project‚Äôs whitepaper or long-term road map.  To test how the digital market has historically viewed token issuance, I took the CoinDesk Market Index universe of tokens and calculated changes in 90-day token supply for the subset of the universe with reliable token supply data (some 135 tokens, see Figure 1 below). From the plot of issuance percentiles below, we can see that over the past four years, the majority of token issuance occurred during the crypto bull market of 2020 to 2021, with the height of average token issuance peaking in the first quarter of 2021 at about 67% annualized. Projects within the top 10% of net issuance distributed token supplies at a 200% annualized rate during the peak. Subsequent token issuance has reduced by over half during the 2022 to 2023 crypto bear market.  Figure 1: Net Token Issuance across CoinDesk Markets Index (CMI) Universe, Percentiles of Net Token Issuance; Date Range: January 2020 ‚Äì August 2023; Source: CDI Research  The overlapping nature of token issuance during the bull market suggests the token issuances were met with optimism by investors looking for growth opportunities within digital assets, and perhaps even a bit of market timing on the part of crypto protocol insiders and early investors.  Figure 2: Multivariate regression results of weekly token returns versus lagged percentage change in 90-day token supply, controlled for momentum and crypto market risk factor. T-stat is shown only for lagged token issuance independent variable. Dashed lines highlight 10% confidence interval bands. Date range: January 2020 to August 2023. Source: CDI Research  To test the market‚Äôs sentiment and reception for token issuance, I ran a regression of weekly crypto token returns against the previous week‚Äôs annualized token issuance from 2020 to August 2023 and controlled for the risk factor (beta of token to bitcoin) and token price momentum effects (see Figure 2 above). I also ran regressions within the crypto bull market (2020 and 2021) and the ensuing winter (2022 to August 2023) to test investor sentiment for token issuance and how it‚Äôs evolved over market cycles. The regression results above show that investors once considered token issuance a bullish event, particularly during the bull market. However, after the market peak, token issuance is now viewed as a neutral to negative event, as investors consider the token dilution effects to be greater than the growth prospects of the protocol‚Äôs road map.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here is some news worth reading:  THE SQUIRRELS: I‚Äôm pretty pleased with these two sentences I once wrote: ‚ÄúAsset classes [besides crypto] have also gotten ensnared in technology drama over the years. For instance, squirrels were a recurring nightmare for stocks, causing power outages that took down Nasdaq‚Äôs market in 1987 and then again in 1994.‚Äù Crypto has always had its version of those squirrels: infrastructure breakdowns and exploits/hacks have plagued the industry for years. While the latter continues, it feels like the former has gotten rarer. But we had a fun one this week. XRP was briefly worth trillions of dollars on Gemini due to a glitch, or maybe just a big order dumped into a low liquidity order book. Regardless, it was the sort of outlandish figure that designers of market structure love to avoid.  THE DOGS: It turns out those silly meme dogs are good for something, after all! Investors have poured money into shiba inu (SHIB) futures. This smart story, citing historical precedent, argues that this could spell bad news for the price of bitcoin (BTC).  THE GIANTS: Huge Wall Street players keep talking about how much they like bitcoin. BlackRock made waves with its bitcoin ETF application, of course. And now private-equity titan David Rubenstein of Carlyle Group just talked up why he thinks BTC is here to stay. ‚ÄúThe mighty BlackRock is willing to have an ETF in bitcoin, maybe bitcoin is going to be around for a while,‚Äù he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/16/why-crypto-investors-should-care-about-tokenomics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/210fb175c0bca4a7feb3aea6cdc1fcde1be1e499-5418x3612.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The development seems only to have increased divisive discussions on crypto-related financial instruments in the U.S.  But to have a more nuanced conversation on the implications of a spot bitcoin ETF for markets, you only need to look north to Canada, where these products have been approved and running successfully for the past two and a half years.  You‚Äôre reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  While the ‚Äúnot-your-keys, not-your-crypto‚Äù crowd will invariably point to the drawbacks of getting portfolio exposure to bitcoin through an ETF ‚Äì namely, the fact that investors don‚Äôt directly own the underlying asset ‚Äì it‚Äôs important to zoom out and understand that the ETF structure does offer benefits to a broader range of investors that goes beyond crypto natives.  Here are a few observations based on the Canadian experience.  Safety  Some crypto investors will always distrust not directly controlling their coins. But the reality is that in Canada, strict regulatory oversight has forced fund providers to operate transparently and adhere to an operational framework that makes the potential for asset commingling, hacks and fraud extremely difficult. To date, investors who have bought units of Canadian spot bitcoin ETFs have never had their assets hacked or had their funds lost through malpractice or poor balance sheet management, which cannot be said for the millions of investors who trusted their assets with the likes of FTX, Celsius Network and BlockFi.  Reliable analog to direct exposure  The SEC has continued to argue that a spot bitcoin ETF could be dangerous for investors while, at the same time, deciding to greenlight bitcoin futures ETFs and the direct buying and selling of digital assets on exchanges. But in Canada, it has been shown that spot ETFs have been very efficient at mimicking direct portfolio exposure to bitcoin without the added uncertainty and volatility of the futures markets and having to deal with the operational opacity of unregulated exchanges.  Accessibility  We can‚Äôt overstate the importance of accessibility when we talk about the potential for an asset to achieve mainstream acceptance. A 2021 study by the Bank of Canada stated that a rise in bitcoin investment in Canada seemed highly correlated with the advent of easy-to-use mobile exchanges. And based on the hundreds of millions of dollars that have flowed into the top three Canadian bitcoin ETFs, it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that the accessibility inherent in a bitcoin-backed financial asset fully integrated into the legacy financial system is appealing to investors.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Gorast Tasevski, Haan Palcu-Chang",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2023/08/16/in-canada-spot-bitcoin-etfs-have-been-working-for-years,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69f3103f0492dcd8b8294fcaffc241e265a21ee8-5477x3651.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16114569,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547521,1692198033,Is An XRP Spot ETF Coming To The US Soon? Bloomberg Analyst Answers,"Ripple has continued to revel in the glow of Judge Analisa Torres‚Äô ruling in favor of the crypto company, with many use cases being touted for its native token XRP. The most recent use case to surface is a Spot XRP ETF, and Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has quickly weighed in on the possibility of this happening. How Possible Is A Spot XRP ETF? Seyffart, during an appearance on Tony Edward‚Äôs Thinking Crypto Podcast, explained that XRP would need to be listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) before the SEC can approve a Spot XRP ETF. Related Reading: Institutional XRP Holdings Rise Rapidly Following Ripple‚Äôs Win Over SEC This argument stems from the SEC‚Äôs requirement for a regulated market of significant size in the underlying asset. Relatively, exchanges looking to list a Spot Bitcoin ETF are, in hopes of gaining approval, relying on the fact that the CME Bitcoin futures, which happen to be a regulated market, provide significant size to provide necessary data and insights for any spot market. So Seyffart also believes that any Spot XRP ETF application will also need to fulfill the requirement of the token having a significant market size that can be used to provide any data and insights needed to prevent fraud and market manipulation. To achieve this and easily get the SEC‚Äôs approval, listing XRP futures on a prominent derivative exchange like CME would be the way to go, in his opinion. Despite his remarks, Seyffart isn‚Äôt so optimistic about a Spot XRP ETF launching anytime as, according to him, this isn‚Äôt something he sees ‚Äúmaterializing in the foreseeable future.‚Äù Token price continues to fall as euphoria wanes | Source: XRPUSDT on Tradingview.com Little Or No Demand Is A Hindrance Another notable highlight from Seyffart‚Äôs remarks was when he suggested that there was little or no demand for an XRP ETF, something which he believes is integral if we are to see any ETF application. However, there is reason to believe this assumption may not be outrightly correct, as certain figures suggest an increasing demand for XRP, notably among institutional investors. Related Reading: Renowned Finance Author Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $1 Million If This Happens Last month, a report stated how XRP‚Äôs sales had jumped significantly this year, with over 2.22 billion XRP sold since the beginning of the year. Furthermore, according to a more recent report, the token recorded an institutional inflow of $0.5 million two weeks ago. Ripple‚Äôs XRP Ledger is also going head to head with the foremost Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, as it has recorded an increase in daily transactions since the beginning of August.

42419749,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFi29,1692197168,"The Machine Economy and the Convergence of Web3, AI and Fintech","Despite the billions of value and millions of users, many people are still looking for crypto‚Äôs ‚Äúkiller use case‚Äù and wondering if the one-true solution exists at all. What they fail to understand is that innovation is a process of novelty search and consequent discovery, not a multiple-choice exam with one right answer.  It is okay to not know where things lead, to be lost, frustrated or confused. At one time, it was similarly difficult to see that our mobile phones would control the global taxi network, or that we would swap the physical wallet and our credit cards for Apple Pay, or that traditional media would yield so fully to digital advertising and personalized social networks. Being in the weeds and looking for the way out is the whole point, and only through the practice of doing can we discover what comes next. It is a mistake to think you are not in the labyrinth, just because you cannot see it.  Lex Sokolin, the founder of Generative Ventures, is the fomer Global Fintech Co-Head at ConsenSys, a blockchain technology company.  So here is where we are with crypto.  Crypto assets give us digital scarcity and financial abstraction; just like the hyperlinks of Web2 pointed to information and tokens point us to value. Decentralized finance has built a banking industry for Web3, the global tribe of techno-utopians, hyper-capitalist arbitrageurs, and idealistic DAO artists. The digital property rights system works, and its financial infrastructure has been shown to perform better than the traditional, centralized counterpart. And yet, we are lost in hyper-financialization and self-referential ponzi games. I spent several years at Consensys focused on tokenomics and governance, with the conclusion that our industry still has a lot of work to do.  There can be no sustainable financial services without a real operating economy. GDP must be generated through productive work and plugged into commerce for utility-generating exchange. People make things and other people consume them. Traditional economies allocate about 10-20% of GDP to their financial sectors, and Web3 should be no different. Some of that productivity will come from digitizing and tokenizing products that address real world demand, integrating legacy economic activity. The rest will need to be built on the Ethereum ecosystem rails.  Read more: Allison Duettmann - How Crypto Can Help Secure AI  DAOs already function as the small business sector of the space, creating digital objects and organizing human activity for economic gain. Given the overwhelming macroeconomic pressure on consumer sentiment and discretionary spending, these goods have not yet found a meaningful market. But money cycles come and go, while technological progress marches ever forward, re-organizing society into a digital twin with social graphs of billions of avatars.  We are entering the age of a new machine economy. Humans, software machines, and our ever-evolving hybrids are connected through fintech financial networks and anchored to blockchains. Digital production, powered and accelerated by generative AI, will lead to the creation of countless digital objects ‚Äì from art and code to goods and services ‚Äì that form the backbone of economic supply and demand. Crypto has built the money, DeFi has built the market venues, and NFTs have built the commercial packaging for this machine economy to flourish.  The concept of the metaverse, and Facebook along with it, gets things wrong in the short term. It should not be about VR headsets or fashionable internet culture -- these things have been around and do not require blockchains. Rather, the most differentiated frontier is in the economic architecture and financial networks built through Web3.  Artificial intelligence now adds the capability for machine systems to generate valuable labor at machine scale, to be wielded by self-sovereign punks and their DAOs. Adoption of AI empowers people to build, just like Web3 empowers people to self-custody and maintain privacy and control. DAOs may yet become autonomous.  AI comes with massive risks that must be addressed. Unchecked, it will exacerbate the problems of Web2, leading to infinite addictive dopamine content delivered by advertising firms into our stressed-out brains. The stimulation will never end. Our data, privacy, and dignity will be owned by everyone other than us. Already, Apple scans our faces into deepfakes to be manipulated on video calls in its Vision Pro headset.  I am optimistic about the incredible open-source movement in AI, integrating and outpacing the model developments of Big Tech. But we must also use the powers of Web3 to make sure that our information, like the Apple deepfakes, is custodied in our wallets. Just as money has become non-custodial, so must our avatars, digital twins and personalized services.  Web3 wallets should store those highly-trained AI agents as NFTs, to be deployed only with our express permission. The NFT standard will move beyond pictures to software capsules, and eventually to semi-intelligent software robots doing work on our behalf. As they interact with the world as extensions of our mind, they will need the ability to make claims, perpetuate our interest, connect to money systems, and maximize utility. It is clear to me that such things should happen on decentralized, open-source rails with a resilient, digital, programmable commerce and finance capability. No government or corporation should have the power to turn off or censor our digital selves.  As our livelihoods shift further into this world, increasingly more parts of the machine economy will need to be built. Many investors have shifted towards AI for sheer novelty and attention momentum. My thesis is that fintech, Web3, and artificial intelligence are one economic whole, and that our ability to grow each relies on their deep synthesis.  This conviction has led me to launch a new venture fund focused on the theme called Generatives Ventures, with its strategy set on the novel digital growth we will see from the machine economy.

This insight comes from prominent analytics firm Glassnode in its ‚ÄúThe Week On-Chain‚Äù newsletter, which delves into the market‚Äôs dynamics and potential implications. Bitcoin Stagnation And Role Of Short-Term Holders The Bitcoin market has witnessed a prolonged period marked by relatively steady BTC price action. This phase has sown seeds of discontent among market participants, prompting speculation about potential downside risks. Related Reading: Bernstein Predicts Spot ETFs Could Claim 10% Of Bitcoin‚Äôs Market If Greenlit So far, the asset only hovers between $29,000 and $25,000 price points creating a tug-of-war between the bulls and bears in that price zones. A noteworthy shift in the Bitcoin market is the dwindling enthusiasm of its short-term traders, commonly referred to as speculators. This group, typically driven by the prospects of swift gains, seems to be re-evaluating its stance, perhaps deterred by the recent lack of significant price movement. Glassnode points out that the market share of these short-term holders has ebbed to a mere 2.56 million BTC. This stands in stark contrast to their presence in October 2021, right before Bitcoin soared to its record high. Yet, while these speculators recede, long-term holders, often viewed as the bedrock of the Bitcoin community, are seemingly undeterred. Their stronghold over the currency is tightening, with a current hold of 14.6M BTC, the highest ever recorded. The report noted: Overall, this suggests that conviction of Bitcoin investors does remain impressively high, and very few are willing to liquidate their holdings. A Market Teetering On Decisions The distinction in purchase prices between the two investor classes has been highlighted as a potential concern. According to the newsletter, Short-term speculators, having bought at a higher average price of $28,600, might be more susceptible to incurring losses with even a modest dip in Bitcoin‚Äôs price. On the other hand, long-term investors, with an aggregate purchase price substantially lower at around $20,300, seem more cushioned against market volatility. This variance in purchasing prices, combined with the contrasting reactions of the two investor groups, paints a picture of a market in flux, divided between those who believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value and those swayed by its immediate price trajectories. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Key Indicators Suggest A Strong Case For More Losses Glassnode believes that ‚ÄúThe separation between these two cost basis is an indicator that many recent buyers have a relatively elevated acquisition price.‚Äù Despite the current market uncertainty, an underlying sentiment that remains clear is the confidence of Bitcoin‚Äôs stalwarts. Their increasing hold suggests a steadfast belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs potential, even as speculators seem to waver amid its current price downturn.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) has won approval to list crypto futures in the U.S. nearly two years after first applying. The National Futures Association (NFA) granted permission for Coinbase to operate a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM), the exchange announced on Wednesday. The NFA is a self-regulatory organization with designation from federal derivatives regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The approval makes Coinbase the first crypto-focused platform in the U.S. to offer regulated and leveraged crypto futures alongside traditional spot trading, according to the announcement.  Perceived safe havens like bitcoin (BTC) and gold struggled to gather upside traction even as signs of cracks in the global market begin to appear in the form of volatility in the fiat currencies of distressed nations. On Monday, the Russian ruble (RUB) fell to 102 to U.S. dollar, bringing its year-to-date loss versus the greenback to 33% and reaching its weakest level since March 2022. The country's central bank hiked rates to 12% from 8.5% in an emergency move. Meanwhile, Argentina devalued its already-weak peso by 18%, sending it to 350 per dollar compared to 287 last Friday. The peso is now down 98% this year against the U.S. unit. So far, the supposed signs of cracks have brought little safe-haven demand for bitcoin, disappointing expectations.  Sei Labs, the company behind layer 1 blockchain Sei, has announced that its mainnet is now live after a successful testnet phase. The blockchain's native token SEI also went live today on exchanges such as Binance, Kraken and Huobi, among others. The focus for Sei is to create a chain that offers users the ability to exchange assets easily, said the Sei Labs team. Whether this means assets for social platforms, games or NFT‚Äôs, Sei is hoping to offer the smoothest experience. SEI was trading at around $0.27 at the time of writing, around the same price as when it launched on Tuesday. The token traded at a premium of $0.64 on Upbit.  Chart of the day  The chart by Fairlead Strategies shows the ratio of bitcoin to ether is hovering near a trendline resistance, characterizing the corrective phase since June.  ""A breakout above the trendline would suggest the long-term uptrend is resuming in favor of bitcoin. However, the 50-day MA has flattened, so we would not be surprised to see resistance stay intact for the time being,"" Fairlead said in a note to clients on Monday.

The firm - founded by a former Meta Novi (Meta‚Äôs digital wallet, which will terminate in September) engineer Mathieu Baudet - has now raised a total of $12 million in funding. Linera will be using the new funding for ‚Äúexpanding the team, launching a devnet and a testnet for the protocol and fostering a strategic presence in the APAC region while continuing to grow their developer academy,‚Äù the company said in a statement.  The layer-1 is pioneering the idea of ‚Äúmicrochains‚Äù within the blockchain, according to the press release. ‚ÄúThe competition for blockspace in traditional layer-1 blockchains, coupled with limited production rates and block sizes, creates a bottleneck during traffic peaks, leaving users outpriced or delayed, rendering the infrastructure effectively unavailable,‚Äù the press release said.  Linera is battling this issue by adding smaller chains into its network rather than increasing the size or production rate of the blocks. This model allows each user to have its lightweight chains, which integrate into browser extensions and mobile devices for Web3 app interactions within the users‚Äô wallets.  The project is looking to bring similar expansion capabilities of Web2 into Web3 apps by allowing an unlimited number of smaller user chains, said the release.  The investors in the new round include Laser Digital Ventures (Nomura), Flow Traders and Eterna Capital. A16z crypto led the company‚Äôs initial seed round last year alongside Tribe Capital.

The least amount of risk is when prices are low, which is NOW. Could they go lower? Yes. So what, they will likely be a LOT higher in 2 years or sooner, so what are you waiting for?‚Äù XRP Price Analysis A price analysis of the 1-day chart suggests that the XRP price is at a crucial point following the summary judgement in the Ripple vs. SEC case. Related Reading: SEC Asks Court To File Interlocutory Appeal Vs. Ripple, XRP Price Stable At press time, XRP was trading at $0.59, down more than 35% from its yearly high at $0.93 following the summary judgment in the Ripple against the US Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) case. Before the verdict was announced, XRP was trading at $0.47, meaning that the XRP price has already lost most of its gains following the euphoria over Ripple‚Äôs victory. A look at the 1-day chart shows that XRP found support at the 100-day EMA at $0.5782 yesterday. Subsequently, XRP bulls managed to stage a small recovery. However, XRP is not out of the woods yet as the correction could continue unless the price shows a signal of trend reversal on the shorter timeframes. A first step would be to break above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.6340. A strong confirmation would be a spike above $0.69 where the 50% Fibonacci retracement level is located. In a bearish scenario, XRP also loses the 100-day EMA and falls towards the 200-day EMA at $0.5256. The level can be interpreted as the most crucial support at the moment. If the ‚Äúbull line‚Äù fails to hold, the XRP price could face a crash to pre-Ripple ruling levels.

In a trend that has been unfolding over the last three days, Dogecoin‚Äôs price has experienced a steady descent, accompanied by a decrease in Open Interest.

Over the past week, the OBV steadily climbed, suggesting an increase in buying pressure. DOGE market cap at $9.8 billion today.

42392670,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgALCZ,1692183600,The FIT Act Is the Most Comprehensive Crypto Regulation Ever Voted on by Congress,"Last month‚Äôs votes by the House Financial Services Committee and House Committee on Agriculture on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT Act) was a milestone for the digital assets industry.  While not yet perfect, the FIT Act is the most comprehensive piece of legislation for the digital assets industry voted on by our elected officials, and marks the first time crypto-focused regulatory bills have been voted out of any committee in the House or Senate.  Kristin Smith is CEO of the Blockchain Association, the Washington D.C.-based trade association representing more than 100 of the industry's leading companies.     Even more encouraging, the FIT Act garnered vital bipartisan support, making it a symbol of cooperation and recognition that this sector is too important for the status quo regulatory regime to stand.  Last month‚Äôs message from policymakers was clear: Crypto is here for good and Congress, not regulators, will determine an appropriate regulatory framework for the industry. The cryptocurrency industry is too significant to be subjected to the whims of partisan politics, and last week‚Äôs vote signaled a shift by lawmakers to come together to develop smart regulations that promote innovation and ensure consumer protection.  These votes highlighted the need for ‚Äì and growing momentum driving ‚Äì bipartisan collaboration to address the complexities and potential of cryptocurrencies effectively. Over and over again, committee members rightly lamented the ineffectiveness of the current regulatory regime, and by association, the hyperactive enforcement campaign by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  We must keep this traction going as emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI continue to advance.  These important votes also come at an important moment for the crypto industry. From the collapse of Do Kwon's algorithmic stablecoin to Sam Bankman-Fried's spectacular fall from grace after the implosion of FTX, the crypto ecosystem has suffered in the eyes of the public, among investors and in Washington D.C. circles.  Collaboration between the industry and policymakers is crucial  However, as of late, the reaction from many in Congress has been one of increasing awareness and acknowledgment that the digital asset industry cannot simply be wished away. As cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology continue to gain traction and pose a practical and philosophical challenge to traditional financial systems, it becomes even more essential for regulators to craft intelligent, forward-thinking rules that foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability.  Maintaining and growing bipartisan support in Washington requires the industry to continue proving the world-changing use cases of the technology. Indeed, beyond the speculative aspects often associated with it, digital assets and crypto networks offer myriad societal benefits.  Just as the internet revolutionized information, cryptocurrency revolutionizes the concept of value. From instant money transfers around the world to artist and creator empowerment to serving the unbanked and underbanked, crypto networks are changing the world for the better.  The FIT Act represents a significant step forward in acknowledging the importance of the digital assets industry, yet there is still work to be done. The forthcoming congressional session after the August recess will prove critical both in terms of refining the bill and embarking on the next phase of policymaking for the industry.  Industry stakeholders, regulators and lawmakers must collaborate to address potential loopholes, uncertainties and regulatory gaps. The goal is to create a comprehensive framework that fosters innovation, maintains market integrity ‚Äî and most importantly ‚Äî protects consumers and investors.  As this process unfolds, organizations such as Blockchain Association remain ready to serve as valuable resources. Collaboration between the industry and policymakers is crucial to strike the right balance between innovation and regulation.

Coinbase Financial Markets secured approval from the National Futures Association (NFA) to operate a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM), according to an announcement on Wednesday. The role of FCMs is to buy or sell futures contracts, similar to that of a market maker.  The NFA is a self-regulatory organization with designation from federal derivatives regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Coinbase first applied to join the NFA in September 2021.  The approval makes Coinbase the first crypto-focussed platform in the U.S. to offer regulated and leveraged crypto futures alongside traditional spot trading, according to its announcement.  ""Offering US investors access to secure and regulated crypto futures is key to unlocking growth and enabling broader participation in the crypto economy,"" Andrew Sears, CEO, Coinbase Financial Markets, said.  The crypto unit of the Cboe Global Markets, Cboe Digital, received approval from the CFTC to offer margined bitcoin and ether futures contracts in June.  ‚ÄúI have been vocal about the benefits of bringing appropriate crypto activities into the regulated space in order to protect customers, but in a way that supports oversight, accountability, transparency, and risk management,‚Äù CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero said at the time.  COIN shares on the Nasdaq opened up over 4% at $82.49. At the time of writing, they were trading at around $81.60, up about 3%.

16107797,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547487,1692182440,Another Crypto Millionaire Has Been Found Dead,"Another shocking discovery has rattled the crypto sector as Christian Peev, a 41-year-old US cryptocurrency investor has been found dead. Christian Peev‚Äôs Alleged Murderer Was A Friend According to Peev‚Äôs cousin, the crypto investor disappeared in early August, and growing increasingly worried, Peev‚Äôs cousin reported him missing to authorities on August 10, which prompted an investigation. The dismembered body of the American-Bulgaria investor was found days later by plumbers called to fix a blocked drain in Sofia, Bulgaria, who eventually discovered that it was pieces of a human body that caused the blockage. Related Reading: Institutional XRP Holdings Rise Rapidly Following Ripple‚Äôs Win Over SEC The remains were later identified to be Peev‚Äôs body, although parts of the body, like the head and bones were missing. These were found to be buried as the murderer could not flush them down the toilet. Following the discovery of the remains, a bartender, Vesco Valchinov has been named as the prime suspect in connection to the murder of Peev. Christian Peev was known to be highly recognized in top events and parties, where he met the bartender. According to sources, Vesco Valchinov and Christian Peev met at a bar about 5-6 years ago, and Peev being a formidable and knowledgeable crypto enthusiast introduced Valchinov to the world of cryptocurrency. Valchinov became the prime suspect in Peev‚Äôs demise as surveillance footage showed that both Valchinov and Peev were seen entering Valchinov‚Äôs residence on August 8, but Valchinov was the only one seen leaving his residence the following day. Forensics show that Valchinov allegedly killed Peev with a dumbbell in his residence.¬†However, Valchinov was not the only one involved in the demise of Christian Peev. Total market cap sitting at $1.121 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Konstantin Subotinov who was believed to be an accomplice to Valchinov was also arrested by authorities and later confessed that he helped Valchinov in disposing of the remains of Peev‚Äôs body by driving some of the parts to Vitosha to bury them. Valchinov apparently knew the authorities were onto him and he tried to lose his tail by fleeing to a hotel in Vitosha. But unfortunately for him, authorities tracked his phone and he was apprehended the following day. Could The Murder Be Money Related? Although the authorities and investigators believe that the murder of Christian Peev is money related, as Peev had amassed a considerable fortune from his crypto investments, jealousy has also been seen as a potential motivation for the murder of Peev. Related Reading: Renowned Finance Author Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $1 Million If This Happens Investigators speculate that Valchinov might have been jealous of his friend Peev and the fortune he has built for himself. However, the investigation is still ongoing, and more details will be unveiled, as authorities tend to crack the case and figure out what led to this tragedy. Peev‚Äôs death marks the second crypto investor found murdered and dismembered in less than a month. In July, crypto influencer Fernando P√©rez Algaba was found dead in Buenos Aires, Argentina. According to authorities, Algaba‚Äôs remains were found in a suitcase and his death is believed to be connected to a significant debt he owed.

16105937,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547465,1692178213,Binance To Delist These Three Tokens In August Due to Non-Compliance,"The world‚Äôs largest exchange Binance announced on Tuesday, August 15, intentions to delist three tokens from its trading platform.¬†According to the exchange‚Äôs official statement, it regularly conducts a periodic review of all cryptocurrencies and trading products on its platform, ensuring they are of the highest standards in order to protect its customers‚Äô interests. This review is based on certain factors, including trading volume and liquidity, network stability, network security against attacks, and the project‚Äôs team commitment, among others. Based on the results of their latest reviews, Binance states the following tokens are lacking in compliance in relation to these factors: Sonm (SNM), Serum (SRM), and DFI.Money (YFII). Therefore, the exchange will be delisting all trading pairs related to these tokens at exactly 03:00 (UTC) on August 22, 2023. In addition, the order extends to other platforms affiliated with the exchange, including Binance Simple Earn, Binance Loans, Binance Gift Card, and Binance Pay. Albeit, the enforcement date varies for some of these platforms. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Similarly To 2019 And 2020? Binance Delisting Leads To Heavy Losses For Tokens Following Binance‚Äôs announcement, Sonm (SNM), Serum (SRM), and DFI.Money (YFII) have all seen their value plunged into double-digit losses. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the SNM token is the largest loser of the trio declining by 79.09% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, SRM and YFII are down by 29.19% and 19.55%, respectively, over the last day. These losses are quite unsurprising, as delisting by any exchange is commonly interpreted by investors as a disapproval of the token. Considering Binance‚Äôs status as a key player in the global crypto space boasting over 150 million users, the exchange delisting a token can be quite detrimental, as seen above. At the time of writing, SNM is trading at $0.05924, while SRM and YFII are exchanging hands at $0.5053 and $584.63, respectively.

42392669,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAL7R,1692178199,"Bitcoin Vapid, Gold Weakens as Russian Ruble and Argentinian Peso Crash","Latest slide in Russian ruble and Argentina's peso reveals cracks in the global market, according to one bank.  Still, perceived haven assets remain under pressure as Treasury yields and dollar index rise.  Perceived safe havens like bitcoin (BTC) and gold struggle to gather upside traction even as signs of cracks in the global market begin to appear in the form of volatility in the fiat currencies of distressed nations.  On Monday, the Russian ruble (RUB) depreciated to 102 for U.S. dollar, reaching the lowest since March 2022. The slide took the cumulative year-to-date loss to 33%, highlighting investors' growing angst about Kremlin's dwindling energy revenues and forcing the central bank to hike rates to 12% from 8.5%, an emergency move.  Meanwhile, Argentina devalued its already-weak peso (ARS) by 18%, sending it lower to 350 per dollar compared to 287 per dollar last Friday. The peso is down 98% this year.  The fresh slide in RUB and ARS represents early signs of stress in global financial markets, according to MUFG Bank. Since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in March last year, many have been biased toward perceived haven assets on fears that the so-called tightening cycle will break something in the global market.  ""It's not that either ARS or RUB depreciation will have direct reverberations for the broader markets, they won't but the developments do highlight the draw of the U.S. dollar as yields continue to move higher. Weak links are nearly always the first to reveal 'cracks' and certainly ARS and RUB are weak links,"" Derek Halpenny, head of research global markets EMEA and international securities, said in a note to clients on Tuesday.  So far, the supposed signs of cracks have brought little safe-haven demand for bitcoin, disappointing expectations.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value, widely considered digital gold due to its finite supply, remains listless above $29,000, extending its multi-week dull price action. Bitcoin was one of the preferred safe havens during Turkey's currency crisis of 2021. Gold, meanwhile, hit a seven-week low of $1,896 per ounce on Tuesday and traded around $1,905 at press time.  Perhaps the ongoing hardening of the nominal and inflation-adjusted U.S. government bond yields, one of the key factors responsible for the latest slide in RUB and ARS, and the uptick in the dollar index, is keeping bitcoin and gold from rallying.  The real or inflation-adjusted yield on the U.S. 10-year note has increased to 1.83%, the highest since 2009, denting the appeal of investing in zero-yielding assets like gold and bitcoin. The nominal 10-year yield has established a firm foothold above 4%.  Per Halpenny, further rise in yields could affect broader markets.  ""If U.S. yields continue to drift higher from here, we are likely to see further 'cracks' appear that could have greater implications for broader markets,"" Halpenny added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/16/bitcoin-vapid-gold-weakens-as-russian-ruble-and-argentinian-peso-crash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/faf646068a4560e5705d0bb95bafc74aec84562a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At that time, ProShares won the race for the first mover effect. And this has paid off. The total assets in Bitcoin futures ETFs accounts to $1.3 billion. Of that, nearly $1.1 billion is in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). The second largest ETF is the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF with $73 million. No other ETF has more than $50 million in assets under management.

In the run-up to the futures ETF launch, BTC put on a 60% rally from Oct. 1 to Oct. 19, rising 60% to $66,970. In the next seven subsequent days, BTC saw a correction of about 14% before Bitcoin continued its rally to the all-time high near $69,000. Whether the ETH price will experience a similar euphoria as Bitcoin in 2021 remains to be seen. At least the environment is different. While BTC was in a full blown bull market, the crypto market is currently in a phase of stagnation, possibly before the start of a new bull market. However, without a doubt, the first Ethereum Futures ETF has the potential to be a catalyst for the ETH price. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,826, just above the key support of the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level.

This selling binge over the past four days has amounted to an astonishing 1.4 trillion SHIB tokens, equivalent to approximately $14.4 million.

Notably, SHIB has demonstrated a commendable performance over the last seven days, exhibiting a robust 5.9% rally now trading at $0.00000998 via CoinGecko.¬†While the cryptocurrency faced a 2.4% slump in the past 24 hours, this transient dip may be attributed to broader market sentiments influenced by seemingly unrelated news. SHIB market cap currently at $5.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com News circulating about potential downgrades within the banking sector might have inadvertently contributed to the 24-hour slump witnessed by SHIB. It‚Äôs worth acknowledging that seemingly unrelated developments can trigger ripples of uncertainty across financial markets, ultimately impacting various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies like SHIB. Such negative sentiments, although momentary, have the potential to trigger short-term pullbacks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs.

As SHIB hovers around its current value of $0.00000998, investors and enthusiasts are cautiously optimistic about the prospects of a sustained price rally. Despite the recent slump, SHIB‚Äôs overall trajectory remains promising, supported by both its recent rally and the depletion of Voyager‚Äôs SHIB holdings.

On March 16, the protocol designed to offer scalable and low-cost smart contract capabilities will ""cliff unlock"" 1.11 billion ARB tokens worth $1.24 billion at the going market rate of $1.12. The amount to be released equates to 87% of the token's circulating supply of 1.275 billion. At press time, over 5 billion ARB tokens remain locked.  Unlocks are staggered releases of cryptocurrencies that had been frozen to prevent early investors or project team members from selling in large numbers. The Cliff unlock method allows for unfreezing a certain number of tokens immediately after a predetermined period, after which unfreezing happens in a linear schedule.  Following the March 16 release, Arbitrum will continue to unfreeze a certain amount of tokens every four weeks for four years, Token Unlocks noted in a tweet.  Unlocks free up liquidity and are considered bearish catalysts for the cryptocurrency's price. A study by analytics firm The Tie shows that unlocks representing more than 100% of the average daily trading volume tend to weigh over the token's price.

16090887,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=547410,1692144053,This Dreaded Candlestick Formation Just Printed: Bitcoin To $18k?,"Bitcoin, the most valuable crypto asset, is at a critical juncture at spot rates if candlestick formation in the weekly chart is anything to go by. One analyst on X, formerly Twitter and NewsBTC Editorial Director Tony Spilotro, is sounding the alarm¬†after picking out the bearish head-and-shoulder pattern in the weekly chart. Will Bitcoin Crack? Although the pattern is technically in the last phase of formation, if realized, it could have dire implications for Bitcoin bulls as it may push prices below a multi-month critical support line toward $18,000 or lower in the weeks ahead. Even so, the volatile nature of crypto and BTC prices means traders should adopt a wait-and-see approach until it prints out. Related Reading: The Subtle Signs A Bullish Bitcoin Trend Is Brewing As of August 15, Bitcoin is stable and within a broader uptrend from a top-down perspective. Notably, the coin is confined within the trading range established between June and July 2023, as visible in the daily chart. Despite the general optimism of a price recovery above July 2023 highs, BTC was moving sideways and held above the $28,000 support level but below the $31,800 printed in the last days of H1 2023. Any breakout above $32,000 with expanding volumes might induce demand, forming an anchor for price gains toward $35,000 or better. While the inability of sellers to drive prices lower is bullish, at least from where buyers sit, the potential formation of the head and shoulder pattern in the weekly chart casts a shadow of doubt over bullish prospects. Subsequently, traders remain cautiously optimistic since the candlestick arrangement, particularly in the weekly timeframe, suggests a vulnerability that could affect market sentiment and hopes for sustained growth. Rate Hikes And Halving: Which Will Be A Stronger Influence? Several fundamental factors further complicate the outlook for Bitcoin‚Äôs price in the coming days. Inflation is relatively high in the United States (versus the benchmark rate of 2%), which may prompt the Federal Reserve to resume interest rate hikes in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Despite relatively stable labor conditions and somewhat subdued inflation, the Fed‚Äôs¬†recent¬†rate hikes, now at the 5.25%-5.50% range, underscore the central bank‚Äôs commitment to curbing inflation and maintaining economic stability.

The potential impact of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs tightening policy on crypto is reminiscent of the events in 2022 when Bitcoin cracked, falling from 2021 peaks to below $16,000 in late 2022. While Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to serve as a store of value, akin to gold, during times of crisis can be a possibility in 2023 and the future, analysts still view it as a ‚Äúrisky‚Äù asset. From a bullish lens, Bitcoin will halve its miner rewards from 6.25 BTC in 2024. This reduction may cause a supply shock, making BTC scarcer, and may support prices in the second half of next year.
