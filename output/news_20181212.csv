42402314,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd40WF,1544655655,Report: Venezuela Is Forcibly Converting Pension Balances to the Petro,"Venezuela has reportedly begun converting pensioners' monthly payments into its controversial cryptocurrency, the petro.  According to the Caracas Chronicles, an English-language politics and economics blog based in the country, the government has recently been taking the bolivars (the country's current fiat currency) paid to its elderly residents and automatically swapping them for petros.  Normally, a pensioner would receive their monthly sum in bolivars, shift the funds to a bank account, and withdraw the fiat from a local branch, the blog explained. However, the government apparently converted residents' bolivars to petros after sending the funds.  Notably, this conversion happened after the government first sent the payments in fiat to residents' web wallets, meaning the Venezuelan government sent pensioners their funds, withdrew them and replaced with an equivalent value of petros.  How pensioners would be able to use their unrequested petros is unclear, as they are not generally accepted. However, it seems to be possible to convert them back to bolivars via a complex process, according to the post. To make matters worse, the value of the petro relative to the bolivar is unstable, rising from 9,000 to more than 15,000 over the course of a few weeks.  Venezuela's president, Nicolas Maduro, first announced that the petro would be used for the country's pension system in August during a televised event.  The token was first announced last year as part of an effort to ""advance monetary sovereignty,"" though the proposal was immediately opposed by the National Assembly (and later sanctioned by the U.S. government).  While the nation claims to have successfully raised hundreds of millions of dollars – potentially as much as $5 billion –selling the token, it is unclear who has invested in it or how much has actually been raised.  Residents are already required to purchase passports using the cryptocurrency, and the nation's salary systems are also expected to begin using the petro.  More recently, Maduro said Venezuela will sell its oil for the petro, rather than the U.S. dollar, to decrease the dollar's importance in the oil market.

Former AriseBank CEO Jared Rice Sr. and former COO Stanley Ford will pay a combined $2.7 million in disgorgement and penalties, as well as $187,767 each in penalties. While neither admitted or denied the charges, both have also agreed to lifetime bans from serving as officers or directors of public companies and from participating in digital securities offerings.  Specifically, the two will pay $2.26 million in disgorgement and $68,423 in prejudgement interest.  Moreover, both are permanently prohibited from violating antifraud and registration provisions of federal securities laws.  AriseBank's ICO was halted by the SEC in January of this year, which sued the company and the individuals behind it for allegedly committing fraud.  The Texas Department of Banking issued a separate cease-and-desist order against the company a day earlier, noting that the company was not authorized to provide banking services in the state, where it was based.  Rice was arrested late last month by the FBI after being indicted on separate criminal charges of securities and wire fraud. He allegedly lied to investors about AriseBank's authorizations, claiming the ""first decentralized banking platform"" could offer Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured bank accounts, credit and debit cards through Visa and other services.  However, the platform reportedly has no relationship with the FDIC or Visa.

The consortium's newest members also include Guangzhishu Technology, Guangzhou Technology Innovation Space Information Technology, KEB Hana Bank, HealthVerity, MediConCen, Techrock, Xooa and BlockDao, Hyperledger said.  With the latest additions, Hyperledger has grown to more than 260 members.  In a statement, Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf said the additions prove that interest in the blockchain space continues to grow, adding:  ""The growing Hyperledger community reflects the increasing importance of open source efforts to build enterprise blockchain technologies across industries and markets. The latest members showcase the widening interest in and impact of DLT and Hyperledger.""  John Calian, a senior vice president at Deutsche Telekom and head of its R&D unit T-Labs, said building a roaming application on Hyperledger's Fabric was ""a natural choice.""  He added that businesses in particular benefit from using an open source, permissioned platform such as one based on Fabric, as it provides a production-ready ecosystem ideal for groups with multiple stakeholders.  Hyperledger has been steadily adding new members in recent months, as well as publishing tools for developers to utilize its software.  Earlier this month, the consortium released a cryptographic library, called Ursa, to help blockchain developers more easily create implementations while cutting down on bugs.

Together with Parity, Geth is one of two softwares used by a majority of the participants in ethereum's network. As such, the move is the latest sign Constantinople is moving ahead on schedule.  The hard fork's activation block was proposed earlier this month during a developer call, setting the stage for the upcoming release. Should users adopt the new code – by design, such upgrades are subject to acceptance by the network's userbase – Constantinople could go live between January 14 and 18. Prior to that, Constantinople would activate on the Rinkeby testnet at block 3,660,663.  Developers had previously proposed to activate the Constantinople hard fork in November 2018, but issues identified during testing led developers to opt to delay that launch in an effort to squash the bugs.  Constantinople seeks to bring an array of design changes, with the broader goal of streamlining the platform's overall code. Notably, it would reduce the per-block mining reward from 3 ETH to 2 ETH, and also push ahead the so-called “difficulty bomb” – a code element designed to promote frequent upgrades – by another 18 months.  Once launched, Constantinople will mark the end of an upgrade process for ethereum formerly dubbed Metropolis. Looking ahead, developers are already working to build what could constitute the next phases of ethereum's development, dubbed ethereum 1x and ethereum 2.0.

In February, the firm also received funding of $1.55 million from ConsenSys Ventures, SoFi and Kenetic Capital, among others, for its stated aim of “bridging the gap” between traditional capital markets and the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

According to a report from Reuters on Tuesday, Utermann was speaking during a panel discussion in London alongside Andrew Bailey, chief executive of U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  He said, “You should outlaw [crypto assets],” because many have lost savings due to the significant slump in the crypto markets. “I am personally surprised that regulators haven’t stepped in harder.”  Bailey, who is also an executive director of the Bank of England, said that Utermann’s comments were “quite strong,” while adding that cryptocurrencies have “no intrinsic value.”  The central bank executive further said that regulators in the U.K. are “closely watching” developments in the crypto sector, including initial coin offerings or ICOs.  The crypto markets have seen a sharp decline in value since the start of this year. In December 2017, bitcoin peaked at nearly $20,000, but prices have since plummeted and the global average across exchanges was $3,387 at press time. The difference marks an over 80 percent decline in value over the period. Most other cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP, have also been hit hard by the bear mood pervading the market.  The FCA formed a task force early this year to ""develop thinking and policy” around cryptocurrencies and blockchain. The group is assessing the impact and the potential benefits of the technology and will determine if, and what, rules might be needed in response to its findings.  The watchdog said last month, however, that it was considering a ban on some cryptocurrency-based derivatives over concerns that retail investors are being sold “complex, volatile and often leveraged derivatives products” with “underlying market integrity issues.”  Allianz Global Investors image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/12/allianz-global-investors-chief-calls-for-cryptocurrency-ban,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/997cfa6f2108dae81d8260ab58be8181be5712dc-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402323,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd40e7,1544617805,Romper Room to White Linen: Saying Goodbye to Crypto's Infant Anarchy,"Sheila Bair is an advisor to Omniex, a technology company providing services to institutional investors, and a board member of the Paxos Trust, a regulated trust company developing blockchain technology.  She does not own crypto assets. The views expressed are her own. The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2018 Year in Review.  When our children were small, we would take them to a local Mexican restaurant that had an upstairs dining room specially reserved for families with young kids. Entering that dining room was entering a cacophony of crying babies and screaming toddlers, with 40-inch tall humans running amok, perilously circumventing waiters and hiding under tables to evade parental clutches.  Given that our own daughter liked to drink salsa right out of the dipping bowl, while our son typically landed more guacamole on the floor than in his mouth — we loved it. It was meant to be anarchy.  No one cared if our kids failed to follow proper dining etiquette. But as the kids matured and acquired proper table manners, we moved downstairs to the main dining room, where the grown-ups demanded a higher level of service, and behaved accordingly. The proprietors even dared to use white table cloths, which remarkably stayed salsa-stain free.  In their early years, the cryptocurrency trading markets were a bit like that upstairs dining room.  Dominated by adventurous, risk-seeking technology buffs (and some crooks), anarchy prevailed as there were no clear rules around trading, know-your-customer or security standards. Every trader looked out for him or herself.  But as these markets have matured, a few exchanges have now sought regulated status as trust companies, subject to annual examinations by bank regulators, capital requirements and the full panoply of anti-money laundering and cyber security rules.  The recent launch of bitcoin futures products on exchanges regulated by the CFTC have reinforced this trend, prompting the adoption of anti-manipulation policies, better market surveillance, and information-sharing agreements between the crypto spot markets and regulated futures exchanges.  As crypto trading has survived and matured, we now we see institutional investor interest picking up (bitcoin prices notwithstanding). Regardless of which cryptocurrencies ultimately succeed (I tend to think bitcoin will survive as a store of value), the smart money has come to accept crypto as a new, legitimate asset class and is seeking well-regulated venues to invest.  Even Boston Brahmin Fidelity is entering the space, recently announcing the launch of a separate company to handle custody and trade execution for institutional customers.  Hurdle ahead  Still, many institutional investors are reluctant to take the plunge.  It is a testament to the strength of the Security and Exchange Commission’s investor protections that they want a way to take a position in crypto through a product on a regulated securities exchange. Yet, recently the SEC disapproved nine applications it received to list a crypto exchange traded product (ETP).  Still pending is the CboeBZX Exchange’s application to list and trade SolidX Bitcoin Shares issued by the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust. Many viewed this application as having the best chance of getting a nod from the regulator.  However, in recent remarks before the Consensus Invest conference, SEC Chair Jay Clayton seemed to pour cold water on SEC approval of any ETP as he re-iterated SEC concerns about the strength of market surveillance in crypto spot markets as well as protections against “theft or disappearance” of crypto assets.  The SEC is right to focus on protecting investors against market manipulation and the security of their crypto assets. These are core to the SEC’s mission. However, there is not an asset class on the planet where absolute guarantees can be made against cyber-attacks or attempted manipulations. The real question is whether the proposed ETP offers protections that are as strong as those afforded investors for other types of exchanged-traded products that have been approved by the SEC.  With regard to protections against investor loss from criminal activity or operational error, the VanEck trust is providing significant protections. Unlike other ETP applications, when an investor buys the VanEck shares, the fund will buy an equivalent amount of real bitcoins. It will secure the bitcoin by using industry best practice: multi-signature cold storage wallets with backups in geographically diverse locations for disaster recovery purposes.  Adding a belt to these suspenders, it will maintain comprehensive insurance to protect investors against loss.  Striking a balance  However, the strength of market surveillance and anti-manipulation policies varies widely across the many crypto trading markets, and this is a cause for concern. On the plus side, the large number of venues in which bitcoin trades arguably makes it less susceptible to manipulation than spot markets for other assets where trading is more concentrated.  Active arbitrage between the OTC and spot exchanges should also reduce manipulation risk. In addition, there are no insiders or material non-public information on which to trade, and it would be difficult to disseminate false or misleading information about bitcoin because aggregate supply is determined by a public, straightforward algorithm.  But on the negative side, the bitcoin spot market's thin liquidity and domination by individual investors increases manipulation risk. The conundrum here is that increased institutional participation in these markets – which would be facilitated by the SEC’s approval of the ETP – is probably necessary to achieve greater liquidity.  More generally, the entry of more demanding institutional traders would have a disciplining effect on crypto exchanges to tighten surveillance. The fact that the initial per-share price of the ETP is 25 bitcoins means shares will be traded by institutional and other substantial investors who are better equipped than retail investors to drive greater transparency and anti-manipulation safeguards.  Yet, the SEC has a difficult task in ensuring appropriate investor protections without setting impossibly high standards. By accommodating greater institutional participation in crypto assets, the SEC could force improved standards in the spot markets where retail investors dominate – sometimes at their peril.  Testing an ETP with an institutional investor base could inform future work on a retail product giving individual investors venues to trade under the watchful eye of the SEC. Crypto assets are ready for the white linen treatment of a fully regulated securities exchange.  Let’s hope the SEC can find a careful path forward.

42402325,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd40h4,1544613307,Bitcoin Price Charts Indicate Glimmer of Hope for Corrective Rally,"Bitcoin's (BTC) struggle to build a notable bounce could end if prices beat key resistance above $3,600.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell to 15-month lows near $3,200 last week, pushing the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) below 30.00 for the first time since 2015.  So, with bitcoin so extremely oversold, a recovery rally cannot be ruled out – more so because there is evidence of bargain hunters challenging the bears’ resolve to push prices lower.  For instance, BTC posted a three-day candle on Dec. 8 that closed below support at $3,463 (low of multiple three-day candles in September 2017), bolstering the already bearish technical setup. Despite that, BTC not only avoided a drop to $3,000 in the last 72 hours but also hit a high of $3,633, if briefly.  Nevertheless, the fact that prices were able to defy the bearish setup indicates that the bulls are beginning to flex a little muscle.  Therefore, a stronger rally could unfold if prices manage to cross the newfound resistance of $3,633 in the next 48 hours or so.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,414 on Bitstamp, having clocked a low of $3,325 earlier today.  3-day chart  As seen above, bitcoin has charted an “inverted hammer” candle, which occurs when prices see a brief rally during a downtrend. It is widely considered a sign of potential trend reversal.  The bullish reversal, however, would be confirmed if the follow-through is positive, that is, the current 3-day candle needs to close above $3,633 on Friday.  That could see prices open up upside toward the psychological resistance of $4,000.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, the 14-day RSI has posted a higher low as opposed to the lower low on price, meaning the indicator is diverging in favor of the bulls.  However, again, a high-volume move above $3,633 is needed to confirm a short-term bullish reversal.  View  A convincing move above $3,633 would validate the inverted hammer candle seen in the 3-day chart and open the doors for a stronger corrective rally to $4,000.  A break above $3,633 would also confirm a bullish divergence of the 14-day RSI and open up upside on the daily chart toward $4,400 (Nov. 29 high).  A break below the recent low of $3,210 would reinforce the overall bearish view, although oversold conditions on the 14-week RSI could limit the downside around $3,000.

The firm's CEO, Jesse Powell, confirmed to CoinDesk that his company is looking to tap a small number of clients for a fundraising round valuing the firm at $4 billion.  ""There is presently a limited time opportunity available to a very small, select number of clients to purchase Kraken shares"" at a $4 billion valuation with a $100,000 minimum, he told CoinDesk via email.  The general public will not have access to these shares, and the exchange is not looking to make a public offering.  The company has not so far determined how much it will look to raise, and any final number will depend on the amount of interest, Powell said. He added that ""the amount of shares available is relatively limited,"" and the exchange will close its offer on Dec. 16.  An email sent to investors describes the move as ""presenting our most valued clients with the opportunity to become equity holders in the company,"" going on to say:  ""We're profitable and sitting on significant reserves so fundraising is not a necessity, however, further aligning interests with our top clients while building a war chest for acquisitions in the bear market presents a win-win opportunity.""  Asked what types of acquisitions Kraken might make, Powell pointed at the exchange's previous purchases of Coinsetter, CAVirtex, CleverCoin and Cryptowatch.  ""We'd be looking for more along those lines, anything that would have strong synergies with our existing product/service offerings, and with great teams,"" he explained.

42402315,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd40ZC,1544608851,Cheap Power Is Luring Battered Bitcoin Miners to Iran,"While some bitcoin miners are estimated to have shut down hundreds of thousands of machines – if not more – others are still out there looking for alternative ways to keep operating.  And it’s Iran, with its extremely low-cost electricity (that can go as low as $0.006 per kilowatt-hour) that’s luring overseas miners. But as attractive as it appears, the journey to setting up shop in Iran isn’t turning out to be a simple one.  Bitcoin mining is, in effect, a kind of energy arbitrage. Miners make their money when the cost of producing coins – currently 12.5 bitcoins per transaction block, plus any fees they’ve accrued – is lower than the operation of the mine itself, including electricity.  Nima Dehqan, a blockchain researcher at a Tehran-based crypto startup Areatak, told CoinDesk that the firm has been meeting with foreign investors that are looking to attempt just that by mining in Iran.  ""We have had investors visiting our farms from Spain, Ukraine, Armenia, France,"" he said.  Dehqan added that his firm has signed a deal with a Spanish investor to set up mining farms in Iran, a process that will consist of three phases.  ""First is sort of a just-to-make-sure testing phase, which is already in place. Second is building new infrastructures together, which somehow has already started, too. And the third will be gathering more investors from outside of Iran,"" he explained.  Dehqan said investors are attracted the cheap electricity, which, depending on the actual source of power, can usually go well below $0.01 per kilowatt-hour. And his firm can run facilities at different scales, from two-to-three-megawatts small farms, to higher amounts like 10 – 20 megawatts.  He said while the electricity cost in Iran has always been relatively low, the recent significant devaluation of the Iranian rial – partially due to the recent sanctions by the U.S. government – has made the opportunities even more appealing.  Secret shift  There's even evidence to suggest miners in countries commonly seen as bitcoin mining powerhouses – China in particular – are looking at Iran for potential opportunities.  Compared to the numbers cited by Dehqan, electricity provided by hydropower stations in China’s southwestern region usually costs around 0.15 yuan – or about $0.02 per kilowatt-hour – in the summer when water is abundant. When winter comes, the cost could go up to $0.04 per kilowatt-hour.  It appears that some Chinese miners have already made the move. A startup based in Chengdu, China, told CoinDesk under the condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisal that it has already deployed 2,000 miners in Iran.  ""Iran has vast natural gas resources and thus the electricity cost can be as low as 0.04 yuan [$0.006] per kilowatt-hour. But Iran doesn’t really have any firm making miners. Now that secondhand miners are being sold cheaply in China, it’s a rather reasonable business decision. With electricity that cheap, you can generate profits in one to two months,"" the company said in a statement.  Javad Sedighi, a self-employed cryptocurrency miner in Iran, echoed that point, telling CoinDesk that local miners largely rely on the import of machines to the country.  ""[That’s] because there are no companies, like Bitmain, [shipping equipment] to Iran. In the past few months, there have been intermediary companies [being] established in Iran that carry out the import of the machines,"" Sedighi said, adding:  ""I think this is done by people who have a lot of power and money. And it's done secretly.""  That kind of potential – particularly for very cheap power – has even caught the attention of notable Chinese bitcoin millionaires like Chandler Hongcai Guo. On Oct. 26, Guo posted a video on his Weibo account, telling a group of audience that there’s a huge opportunity in Iran where electricity cost can go well below $0.01 kilowatt-hour.  ""It’s suitable for hosting secondhand miners that are on the edge of shutting down in China and can make profits in one to two months,"" he was recorded as saying, and asked interested miners to visit Iran to do their own due diligence.  No simple paths to entry  But in conversation with CoinDesk, Dehqan sought to temper the idea that miners are rushing into Iran en-masse since the methods by which foreign investors can set up mining facilities are anything but simple.  The Chinese miner that has set up 2,000 machines said one major hurdle for outsiders is to get miners inside the country to begin with, let alone establishing partnerships with local farms.  The company explained that, currently, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – a branch of the country’s military – still has significant sway on the border. Simply put, they have the power to decide which shipments come in and which ones do not.  ""There’s the risk of miners being detained and confiscated at the border. While some logistic companies may have an insurance policy to cover the loss but you can only get compensated by fiat and miners will be gone,"" the firm said, adding:  ""It’s still very risky. Even though we also try to act as an agent to help other miners go overseas, many of them remain hesitant.""  Dehqan echoed that point and added it’s not so easy to import miners into Iran and some special shipping procedures are necessary.  Sanction complications  And it's not just internal pressures like border security that are proving to be barriers to would-be investors. Indeed, there’s one particular figure – U.S. President Donald Trump – who has thrown some wrenches into the proverbial gears.  As it stands, current U.S. sanctions have further deterred potential investors that have ties to the world’s largest economy. Guo, who owns a mansion in California, told CoinDesk via WeChat that while he agrees the opportunity is very attractive now that the bitcoin mining difficulty and the overall network hash rate have both dropped significantly, investors like him would not dare to become involved.  ""I didn’t go visit myself, considering that the U.S. has imposed the economic sanctions on Iran,"" he said, alluding to recent news that the chief financial officer of Huawei was arrested in Canada for alleged involvement in sanctions fraud.  ""Most of the mining giants in China, or miner makers, do not dare to host their machines in Iran. This is the general situation. As attractive as the electricity over there might be, only miners at an individual or much smaller scale are shifting to Iran. Most people are still hesitant."" Guo said.  On Aug. 6, the Trump administration announcedhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-reimposition-united-states-sanctions-respect-iran/ it would re-impose sanctions on Iran starting from Aug. 7 after withdrawing from a nuclear agreement the U.S. government first entered in 2015. However, the European Union, Russia and China have been reportedly seeking to uphold the agreement to allow businesses and financial transactions to continue with Iran.  According to Sedighi, cryptocurrency mining in Iran itself is still a legal grey area, which means that it’s neither entirely legal or illegal.  ""The rules of the mining industry in Iran have not been approved by Parliament. But it is in hand,"" he said. ""In Iran, like the rest of the industry, you do not have a license to operate. For example, you can not get a bank loan.""  To that effect, Sedighi said the local crypto community is working together to push Iranian lawmakers to pass a formal law that would protect the mining industry, thus enabling it to attract capital and grow.  ""We believe that political disagreements between governments should not harm the people,"" he said, concluding:  ""There have been very much talks about sanctions, as well as methods that should be used by the Iranian crypto society to avoid harming sanctions.""

Gox.  According to a report from The Mainichi on Wednesday, prosecutors claimed at the Tokyo District Court that Karpeles used customers’ funds for his own personal use.  He reportedly transferred 341 million yen (or $3 million) of customers' money kept in an Mt. Gox bank account to his personal account during September–December 2013, according to a court indictment. They cash, they said, was taken for uses such as ""investing in a software development business for personal interest.""  Karpeles is also accused of manipulating the data on Mt. Gox’s trading system to fabricate the balance and playing a great role in “totally destroying the confidence of bitcoin users.""  Back in 2017, Karpeles pleaded not guilty in the court to the charges of embezzlement and data manipulation, and he also denied such allegations at the time.  Later in April of this year, he apologized for the company’s bankruptcy, stating, “I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that’s taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.”  Mt. Gox officially filed for liquidation in April 2014 after claiming to have been hacked for 850,000 bitcoin, some of which was later found.  The case has been ongoing since then. In July 2018, creditors had a victory when the court issued an order approving a petition to begin civil rehabilitation.  Last month, the trustee of Mt. Gox, Nobuaki Kobayashi was seeking to extend the deadline for filing civil rehabilitation claims to December from the earlier deadline of October.

Users can now manage both bitcoin and euro deposits in one place with the ""safety and convenience"" of the German bank account, Bitwala said. Accounts and debit cards are free, though it charges a one-percent transaction fee for trading bitcoin.  Euro deposits of up to €100,000 (or $113,257) are protected by local laws like any other traditional bank accounts in Germany, the firm added.  Jan Goslicki, Bitwala’s chief compliance officer and co-founder, said:  ""We were able to bring cryptocurrencies into a fully compliant banking setup regulated in Germany. This shows that cryptocurrencies can fit into regulatory frameworks which protect consumers and ultimately inspire trust.""  The firm said it has started on-boarding 40,000 customers who pre-registered for the service and will be accepting new users with immediate effect.  Customers will also be able to use their Bitwala crypto accounts to receive salaries, pay rent and trade bitcoin, according to Bitwala's chief financial officer Christoph Iwaniez.  The crypto banking service was first scheduled to launch last month after Bitwala announced the SolarisBank partnership back in October. The startup said at the time that it hoped to launch its own bank one day and was planning to apply for a German banking license next year.

42402320,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd40c9,1544591712,The Future of ICOs: In the Hands of Regulators or Innovators?,"William Mougayar is the founder of Token Summit and author of ""The Business Blockchain.""  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2018 Year in Review.  What is the future of initial coin offerings (ICOs) as we look to a 12-month horizon?  As an early supporter of ICOs (properly run), I’d like to offer a broad perspective on where I think we are, and where we are going. Just as bitcoin and blockchain-based cryptocurrencies challenged our traditional views of money and its movements, ICOs should make us question three well-entrenched sectors: venture capital, public finance and entrepreneurship.  That’s a tall order for a concept that is barely two years old in actual practice.  The Regulatory Questions  For each of these three sectors, ICOs have encountered the headwinds of change, but the most critical friction comes from regulators. If regulators continue to perceive ICOs as nothing more than a securities offering, that stance poses a real threat to the emancipation of the ICO market. The emancipation that is needed is not so much of the quantitative kind (number of ICOs and amounts raised), but rather of the qualitative nature (i.e. reflecting innovative uses of tokens that empower companies to embed them into their business models).  A few months ago, via a speech by one of its commissioners, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) gave a sliver of hope to the viability of tokens. When the network on which the functioning token or coin is sufficiently decentralized, the SEC said the underlying token is not a security, because the existing U.S. Securities Act regime adds little value, due to the lack of central actors.  But there is no point rejoicing about that statement because the SEC offered no path to get to that stage, other than to start creating tokens as a security.  To date, the SEC has publicly recognized only two such tokens as not securities: bitcoin and ethereum. While this was a positive development, it leaves a huge cloud of doubt and uncertainty over the many other bonafide tokens that deserve a similar acknowledgement.  Realistically, decentralization alone is not a sufficient checkmark for a laissez-faire regulatory attitude. Heeding the SEC position, some token issuers have been going out of their way to lower their “central actor” role in order to remain in that classification box. The sad part of that direction is that prematurely decentralizing governance can actually hurt proper management of a given technology more than benefit it. Projects that are still in the development stages can become disjointed and lose progress efficiency when they are not centrally managed.  Actual token usage by real users is arguably more pertinent to labelling the role of a token as a non-security, whether the governance is central or not. It is the network’s decentralization aspect itself that is the primordial factor, so why cripple those who are attempting to implement decentralization too early?  Every token is inherently a currency of sorts, or a right to some action.  It can be earned via mining a network, validating a transaction, or doing some human work, or sharing data, and it can be spent accordingly in return for a variety of services, both of technical and non-technical natures. A token is therefore effectively a medium of exchange for services between consumers and developers alike.  The Promise of Innovation  What is at stake here? Nothing less than the role of the token as a key innovative model for the blockchain economy.  The token as a decentralized utility is essentially needed, but not all tokens can be born as a security. It would be disastrous to the blockchain industry if we labelled utility tokens as securities when the primary ownership intent is one of usage, not profits. Labeling a token as a security at birth or even during the development and product-to-market fit evolutions restricts their movements, especially the efforts of putting them in the hands of consumers and developers who want to use them.  That can kill innovation that is begging to experiment with token functionality.  Going the securities route to escape regulatory scrutiny is like hiding under a rock. Yes, you can be regulatory compliant but your token still needs to prove its utility, gain adoption and have a defensible business model. If you don’t, users who followed you can still lose a lot of money. So, complying is not a bullet-proof way to consumer protection.  There can be numerous approaches for consumer protection, only if there is a willingness to be open minded and patient enough to let the models bear their fruit. Innovation is restricted when it is boxed within the same set of regulatory confines that were devised many technology generations ago. Just as the Securities Act adapted to online trading, it must adapt and bend to accept the realities of the blockchain’s new paradigm.  An ICO is only the beginning of the journey, and not an exploit in of itself. Reaching the right token-to-market fit stage takes time, just as product-to-market fit iterations take time to perfect in tech startups.  Birthing an alternative funding system is complicated and takes some iterations including practice dances and mis-steps with regulators. Maybe the first generation of ICOs can be iterated upon, but ICOs 2.0 want a fair chance for success.  The elephant in the room are the regulators, and that room is full of china today. They could wreak havoc in it, or they can allow it to prosper by staying outside the room, monitoring results and inflows, while not getting involved in the sausage-making itself as long as what comes out is valuable, innovative, lawful, ethical and real.  If all tokens were labelled as securities, then consumers could not easily use them, and that would be a tragedy. This is an existential position for the future of the ICO and it is intricately tied to the classification of tokens as a new asset class due to its inherently new properties.  Granted, we don’t have so many examples of tokens being used as a widespread utility, but once we do, we will look back and be astonished that we were fighting the trend.  I am optimistic that the long-term prospects of cryptocurrency in the U.S. are good, but the short-to-medium term may not be. Let us not erect so many bumps along that road.  I predict that 2019 will be the year where, at least in the U.S., the SEC and the blockchain industry will come head to head. The industry will challenge the SEC’s ultra-conservative stance on the looseness of their interpretation of the Securities Act as far as applying them to good ICOs and token use cases.  The regulators could end-up governing the future of ICOs if they keep their old lenses, but we shouldn’t let them. Regulators are supposed to be reactive to innovation and not stifle it before it is born. They are supposed to follow the market, not preempt it with early shots.  Let us hope that entrepreneurs and the industry they represent are the ones leading by example, and showing the way to the future of ICOs and the innovative token models they engender.
