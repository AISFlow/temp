14934389,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542840,1689458441,Why Ripple’s Victory Against The SEC May Be Short-Lived: Legal Expert,"The news of Ripple’s recent partial victory against the SEC after a legal battle spanning almost three years sent a ripple of joy around the entire crypto industry. However, according to a legal expert on Twitter, Lawyer Bryan Jacoutot, the victory might be short-lived as SEC has enough grounds to appeal the decision and drag this thing out for a lot longer. The SEC’s Lawsuit Against Ripple Labs The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs in December 2020, alleging that Ripple had conducted an unregistered securities offering worth over $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP. According to the SEC, XRP is a security under federal securities laws. But the court determined on June 13 that the random “programmatic sale” of XRP to regular investors does not constitute the sale of an unregistered security under Howey. Related Reading: Large Exchanges Relist XRP Following Ripple Victory Over SEC However, sales to institutional investors fall under Howey, which is used in the United States to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract. In this case, the Court found that the buyers couldn’t know who was selling them the XRP, unlike the institutional investors who would expect Ripple Labs to use the capital for the betterment of the Ripple ecosystem. According to Jacoutot, the Court’s reasoning is weak and Howey was misapplied in the case. The Court reasoned that regular investors bought XRP fully knowing that it is subject to the general cryptocurrency market trends, especially secondary sales of XRP tokens. However, Jacoutot believes those buying XRP would have also expected to make a profit from the efforts of Ripple Labs. XRP price at $0.7254 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com The attorney also made a case of the Ethereum Foundation, as everyone who took part in the pre-sale of ETH knew they were buying from Ethereum Foundation. When looking at the XRP ruling in a similar manner, this would mean institutional investors of the ETH presale also bought unregistered securities. What Does The Ruling Mean? According to Jacoutot, the ruling opens up a few loopholes that can be exploited. In a tweet by attorney Joe Carlasare on Twitter, it explains that the logic of the ruling leaves an opening that can be used to lawfully launch a pyramid scheme. In this case, profits from the “programmatic sales” to retail investors can be distributed to institutional investors. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the ruling provided relief and that the company could now promote the various use cases for Ripple and its technology without worrying about legal repercussions. Related Reading: XRP Kicks Out BNB To Become 4th-Largest Crypto After 65% Rally This is definitely a win for Ripple, but an appeal by the SEC could drag out the legal battle for years and create another round of major uncertainty in the crypto market. The price of XRP skyrocketed after the ruling. It is now up by 50% this month and is currently trading at $0.7154.

Monochrome is working in partnership with Vasco Trustees on this endeavor. The proposed ETF, dubbed the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF, aims to provide Australian retail investors with direct exposure to Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), according to a company announcement on July 14. Monochrome's CEO, Jeff Yew explain the firm's intents, emphasizing that the need for Australian retail investors to be able to access Bitcoin within a regulated environment, promoting greater freedom to engage with the asset class within an established regulatory framework. Yew pointed out the security advantages of a regulated ETF over unregulated exchanges. With a regulated ETF, investor protection is assured, while unregulated exchanges may lack such safeguards. This added protection will likely inspire confidence and increase participation in the crypto market among retail investors. Impact and Future Expectations Partnering with Vasco, Monochrome is well-positioned to offer regulated exposure to cryptocurrencies for retail investors. Vasco, functioning as Monochrome's ""Responsible Entity Partner,"" holds the required authorization under an Australian Financial Services Licence to do so. Yew further noted that a Bitcoin ETF on the ASX could significantly change the perception of traditional investors, marking an end to the unregulated ""Wild West"" phase. The structured, familiar, and secure environment provided by an ETF could boost investor confidence in the crypto market. The proposal of a Bitcoin ETF on the ASX indicates significant progress towards mainstream adoption and regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Australia. This updated application aligns with the recent global trend of increasing interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, evidenced by filings from financial behemoths like Fidelity, Invesco, Wisdom Tree, Valkyrie, and BlackRock. The introduction of the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF would provide investors with ""direct exposure"" to Bitcoin, according to the company's official statement. This represents a notable milestone as the first filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF on the ASX under the country's new crypto regulations. As such, on the outset, forthcoming decisions regarding Monochrome's Bitcoin ETF application could set an important precedent for future crypto asset investment vehicles.

The United States-based crypto exchange is again in the news following the fierce back-and-forth between itself and the United States’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a blog post yesterday July 14, the exchange announced a temporary suspension of its staking operations in the four states following preliminary orders by local state regulators. These states have laws enabling these agencies to issue preliminary orders even before legal proceedings begin. Other Fronts In Legal Action For Coinbase Apart from the aforementioned states, the exchange is also facing legal action from regulators in Maryland, Vermont, Kentucky, Illinois, Alabama, and Washington. Unlike the previous four states however, Coinbase’s staking services are unaffected and customers “remain eligible to stake crypto just as they were before.” These string of events comes after the SEC finally filed a lawsuit against the exchange last June 6. In the lawsuit, the agency alleged that the exchange acted as an unregistered broker, which the exchange has vehemently denied. Almost immediately, the respective regulatory bodies of the above-mentioned states initiated their own legal proceedings against Coinbase. Taking a Stand Coinbase however, remains unfazed by the lawsuit and the subsequent legal actions by local state regulators. It has reiterated its position that staking services are not securities and calls on the SEC to enact reasonable crypto policies instead of its current path of regulation-by-enforcement. “It might be the easier path to simply cut off staking services in the ten states that have initiated proceedings against us, but we believe that would be wrong as a matter of law, wrong for our customers, and wrong for the future of the cryptoeconomy,” the exchange said. After these statements, the exchange reiterated its call for the crypto community to come together for pro-crypto policies and make the U.S. a hub for crypto.

The alleged hacker gave an interview from a French prison, where he is currently held for what he describes as a ""small money-laundering case."" The funds in question, totalling €200,000, reportedly comprise profits from an IT business he operates with his father and a portion of the cryptocurrency that Euler allegedly allowed him to keep post-exploit. Deconstructing the Heist Euler Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol developed by UK-based Euler Labs, suffered a significant loss on March 13. The alleged hacker, Jaime, reportedly exploited a vulnerability in the protocol's code, enabling him to redirect investor deposits into his personal wallets. Euler Labs has yet to comment on these recent developments. The company previously stated that the hacker had returned all the recoverable funds. Despite his open admission of involvement, Jaime's story is not without contradictions. He maintains that the €200,000 cash he was found with on his person was a combination of legitimate earnings and a portion of the cryptocurrency spoils from the hack that Euler permitted him to retain. According to Jaime, Euler deemed these assets tainted due to their passage through Tornado Cash, a coin mixer sanctioned by the U.S. government last year. Legal Fallout Although Jaime currently faces charges related to money laundering in France, his potential involvement in the $200 million exploit could lead to more serious allegations. Interestingly, Jaime is reportedly held in a minimum-security prison in Nanterre, a Parisian suburb. However, verifying this information is challenging due to France's lack of a public prisoner database. In a bid to clarify his actions and possibly salvage his image, Jaime has made his intentions to help Euler regain its previous Total Value Locked (TVL) known. As of now, Euler's TVL stands at around $76,000, a substantial drop from its pre-hack value of over $300 million. The protocol has disclosed plans for a newer version (dubbed Euler V2) as well as plans for constructing a decentralized exchange called EulerSwap. Regardless of his expressed remorse and willingness to help Euler recover, the ongoing legal proceedings and the severity of the accusations Jaime faces could significantly impact his future.

Despite the impressive price rally in May, recent trends suggest a decline in engagement and investor interest. As the crypto market continues to evolve, concerns are mounting about the broader implications of Dogecoin’s waning appeal. Dogecoin’s engagement metrics have faltered, leaving some experts wondering if the crypto’s allure is wearing off. Market indicators show a decline in trading volume, with fewer transactions taking place compared to previous months. Will this once-beloved digital currency be able to regain its momentum, or is its star beginning to fade? Dogecoin New Addresses Stagnant The growth of new addresses joining the Dogecoin community has hit a roadblock since May, according to a recent DOGE price report. However, on-chain data analysis reveals that this stagnation in new holders has not adversely affected the weighted sentiment associated with the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: BNB Chain Inks New Record With Soaring User Activity – A Boost For Price? Source: Santiment As of the latest update, DOGE’s weighted sentiment stands at -0.645. This metric provides insights into the average sentiment attached to a particular cryptocurrency, taking into account the unique social volume surrounding it. Interestingly, despite the somewhat negative value, the weighted sentiment has shown improvement from its low point of -1.99 on June 9. This shift suggests that the prevailing defeatist perception during that period has gradually shifted towards a more optimistic outlook. DOGE market cap slightly above the $10 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com Social Volume And Holder Count: A Diverging Trend However, while the weighted sentiment demonstrates a positive trajectory, the coin’s social volume tells a different story. Instead of aligning with the stagnant number of holders, the social volume of Dogecoin has remained remarkably low since June 9, as per Santiment’s data. Social volume measures the number of mentions and discussions specifically related to a cryptocurrency across various platforms. In the case of Dogecoin, this metric indicates a significant decrease in overall online activity and conversations surrounding the coin. Related Reading: Cardano Development Activity Dropping – What Does It Mean For ADA Price? As of now, there have been no significant changes in the aforementioned trends. This suggests that the hype surrounding DOGE has diminished considerably. From a market perspective, this could potentially indicate that the coin is undervalued and has yet to reach its peak valuation. The road ahead for Dogecoin appears challenging, as the cryptocurrency grapples with stagnant new addresses and a decline in social volume. However, it would be premature to discount the resilience of this meme-based digital asset. Source: Coingecko As of the latest data from Coingecko, the price of DOGE stands at $0.068, reflecting a decline of 4.7% over the past 24 hours. However, despite this recent dip, Dogecoin has experienced a seven-day rally of 4.6%, showing signs of resilience in the face of short-term fluctuations.

14918038,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542795,1689420862,Polygon (MATIC) Flexes Muscles In The Last Week With 27% Gain – Details,"Polygon (MATIC) has demonstrated a significant price surge in the past week, rising by 27.39%. This bullish momentum has been further reinforced by a 9.38% increase in the last 24 hours. However, in the most recent hour, the price experienced a slight decline of 1.04%. Currently trading at $0.84 per MATIC, the cryptocurrency remains 71.11% below its all-time high of $2.92. Reasons For The Price Movement Multiple factors have contributed to the recent price movement of the crypto. Firstly, a favorable court ruling for XRP ripple effect on market sentiment, potentially influencing the performance of other cryptocurrencies like MATIC. The court’s determination that XRP is not a security has provided investors reassurance and positively impacted the overall cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: PEPE Sees Sharp 17% Surge, But Will This Whale Spoil The Party? Furthermore, the increased activity of decentralized applications (Dapps) on the Polygon Network has significantly driven up demand for MATIC. The network’s reputation as a scalable and efficient solution for the Ethereum network has attracted numerous developers and users to build and interact with Dapps on the platform. This heightened interest in the Polygon Network has increased demand for MATIC tokens. Additionally, the highly anticipated launch of Polygon 2.0 has generated excitement within the community. This proposed upgrade aims to enhance the functionality and scalability of the Polygon Network, allowing for the support of multiple chains without compromising security. If successfully implemented, Polygon 2.0 could further solidify MATIC’s position as a leading blockchain solution, potentially attracting more investors and driving higher prices. Expectations For Polygon Looking ahead, Polygon holds promising prospects for further growth and development. With a total value locked (TVL) of $1 billion on the Polygon Network, the platform has established itself as a prominent second-layer scaling solution for Ethereum. The increasing TVL, which has grown from $878 million in the previous month, indicates a rising demand for Polygon’s processing capabilities and underscores its potential for further adoption and expansion. The impending launch of Polygon 2.0 adds a layer of anticipation. This upgrade will introduce new features and improvements, enhancing the network’s efficiency and functionality. If successfully implemented, Polygon 2.0 could attract even more users, developers, and investors, ultimately driving up the price of MATIC. However, it is essential to exercise caution and closely monitor the market. While the current price movement suggests positive momentum, competition from other scaling solutions, such as Arbirtrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP), should be considered. Additionally, developments in privacy implementations utilizing zero-knowledge proofs could introduce new dynamics to the market. Related Reading: XRP Explodes With 1,300% Surge In Trading Volume As crypto Exchanges Jump On Board Investors and traders should remain attentive to updates regarding the Polygon 2.0 upgrade, ongoing market trends, and any significant announcements within the cryptocurrency ecosystem that may impact the future performance of MATIC.

This surge in user engagement has coincided with a surge in the value of the BNB token, which has experienced a steady increase of over 5% within a single week. As BNB’s daily active users continue to soar, one can’t help but question the overall impact of this unprecedented growth. What lies behind BNB’s ability to outshine its rivals and attract a growing user base? Is there a hidden catalyst propelling its value upwards? Moreover, as these metrics diverge from the norm, skeptics begin to raise valid concerns about the sustainability and potential risks associated with BNB’s rise. BNB Chain Surpasses BTC, ETH In Daily Active Users In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, BNB Chain has recently achieved a significant milestone, surpassing renowned chains such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in terms of daily user activity. According to a BNB analysis, the chain secured the second position, solidifying its position as a formidable player in the crypto world. Related Reading: Cardano Development Activity Dropping – What Does It Mean For ADA Price? Token Terminal’s data also revealed that BNB Chain boasts an impressive count of over 1 million daily active users, a testament to the platform’s growing popularity and appeal. This notable achievement is even more remarkable considering the longstanding dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have traditionally held the top positions in the cryptocurrency market. Source: Token Terminal The BNB token has also made waves in the market. Currently priced at $248.78, it experienced a slight setback with a 3.5% slump in the past 24 hours. However, the token quickly bounced back with a decent 5.4% increase in the last week. Source: CoinMarketCap Mixed Signals While the BNB Chain has garnered widespread enthusiasm and positioned itself as a competitive player in the crypto market, recent data from Santiment reveals a nuanced picture. Despite the chain’s impressive user base, as measured by daily active addresses, the level of excitement appears to be relatively consistent without any notable spikes, according to Santiment’s analysis. Source: Santiment Related Reading: Optimism (OP) Rides The Wave Of Today’s Crypto Surge With 15% Rally When examining the Total Value Locked (TVL) metric, which indicates the amount of assets held within a blockchain protocol, BNB Chain falls behind Ethereum and Tron, occupying the third position. As of the latest data, the TVL for BNB Chain stands at approximately $3.4 billion, highlighting room for growth in this area. Total cryptocurrencies market cap at $1.18 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Similarly, the stablecoin market cap on the BNB Chain has exceeded $5 billion. However, Santiment’s charts indicate that both the TVL and market cap metrics have yet to exhibit a significant upward trend, despite the chain’s growing user base. This suggests that while BNB Chain boasts a higher number of active users, the overall TVL and market cap have not fully reflected this growth.

14912758,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/blockfi-ceo-disregarded-warnings-about-ftx-ignored-risk-team,1689407700,"BlockFi CEO Disregarded Warnings About FTX, Ignored Risk Team","Court documents have revealed that Zac Prince, CEO of bankrupt crypto lending firm BlockFi, ignored warnings from the company’s risk management team regarding exposure to FTX and Alameda Research. By the time it filed for bankruptcy, BlockFi had around $1.2 billion in assets tied to FTX and Alameda. Warnings Ignored The document revealing the details was filed on behalf of former customers of BlockFi. According to the document, Prince disregarded and blatantly ignored several warnings from the company’s risk management team over lending to FTX’s sister entity, Alameda Research. However, Price allegedly dismissed all concerns from the team, with BlockFi lending Alameda Research around $217 million by August 2021. The risk management team had also flagged several risks associated with the FTT token used to secure the loans if they required liquidation. However, these warnings were also ignored. The filing stated that the risk management team flagged concerns as early as 2021. “As early as August 2021, BlockFi’s risk management team was advised that Alameda’s balance sheet was largely comprised of ‘~7bb unlocked FTT and 11bb total including locked tokens based on unaudited financials. This set off alarms at BlockFi. Mr. Prince dismissed the concerns, urging the risk team to learn to ‘get comfortable [with Alameda] being a three arrows size borrower, just with FTT and other collateral types instead of GBTC shares.” In January 2022, the risk management team stopped issuing warnings to Prince about loaning to Alameda Research. Instead, discussions moved to Slack, where the CEO occasionally acknowledged BlockFi’s exposure to FTX and Alameda. BlockFi had around $1.2 billion in assets tied to Alameda and FTX when it filed for bankruptcy. Subsequently, BlockFi halted withdrawals on the 10th of November, 2022, citing the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research. Bad Business Practices When BlockFi filed for bankruptcy, it stated that it had significant exposure to FTX and its associated entities. Furthermore, FTX US received a $400 million credit line from BlockFi, further deepening their association. “BlockFi recalled its loans from Alameda [in June 2022], and Alameda repaid its outstanding balance to almost zero. BlockFi then could have walked away from the relationship. Instead, it re-lent Alameda nearly $900 million (between July and September 2022), almost exclusively collateralized by FTT.” The filing further stated that while the FTX collapse triggered BlockFi’s downfall, poor decision-making and bad business practices were the ultimate reason behind BlockFi’s bankruptcy. “It may be true that Alameda/FTX’s downfall triggered BlockFi’s downfall, but BlockFi’s demise was rooted in business practices and decisions well preceding Alameda/FTX’s bankruptcy filing.” The filing described BlockFi’s functioning as a “flawed business model” and that the company took an unnecessary and unreasonable risk, leading to cataclysmic losses. It also added that BlockFi was not a regulated lending institution and challenged claims that BlockFi debtors are in a better position compared to FTX debtors. BlockFi Disagrees A representative from BlockFi responded to the filing, stating the company disagrees with the report, adding that the report cherry-picked statements and does not deliver an objective analysis. BlockFi blamed direct exposure to FTX as the reason for its bankruptcy. “Ultimately, BlockFi failed because FTX and Alameda were and are fraudulent enterprises, and the Special Committee [of independent directors] has not uncovered any evidence that the Released Parties knew, should have known, or reasonably could have known, about FTX’s and Alameda’s true nature.” Meanwhile, FTX and other companies have opposed BlockFi’s bankruptcy plans in court filings, leading to delays in the execution of those plans. BlockFi currently owes between $1 billion to $10 billion to creditors. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

CZ Disputes Media Reports The layoffs at Binance come after a wave of regulatory scrutiny in the US caused doubt in the industry’s future. Binance and its rival Coinbase were sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly violating securities laws.

Currently facing strong resistance at the EMA50 daily level, AVAX is showing promising signs of potential bullish momentum. As buyers accumulate AVAX anticipating a breakout, optimism grows within the market. As of the latest data, Avalanche is trading at $15.45 per AVAX, showcasing impressive price growth within the past week. With a circulating supply of 345,845,505.008 AVAX, the token’s total market capitalization stands at $5,294,894,681.68. Furthermore, AVAX has experienced a substantial surge in trading volume, which has increased by $2,091,996,941.63 in the last 24 hours, marking a significant 381.96% rise. In the past day, approximately $547,703,576.77 worth of AVAX has been traded. AVAX: Strong Resistance And Accumulation The EMA50 daily level has emerged as a formidable resistance point for the coin, presenting a considerable challenge for buyers to overcome. However, buyers’ increasing accumulation of AVAX indicates a positive sentiment and a belief in the token’s potential to breach the resistance level. Traders have noticed similarities between AVAX and other successful cryptocurrencies, drawing comparisons that suggest a potentially significant price surge. Related Reading: XRP Explodes With 1,300% Surge In Trading Volume As crypto Exchanges Jump On Board Looking at the technical indicators, its relative strength index is at 65 in the neutral zone between the oversold region of 50 and the overbought region of 75.

In addition, the histogram bars are green and signal that a bullish trend is ahead and if the bulls persist, the crypto is likely to have a sustained uptrend in the coming days Growing Investor Interest And Bullish Sentiment The ongoing accumulation of AVAX demonstrates a growing interest and confidence among investors in the token’s underlying technology and future growth potential. As buyers strategically position themselves at key support regions, they aim to capitalize on the anticipated breakout and potential price appreciation. This accumulation activity is a positive indicator for AVAX and reinforces the belief that the token’s price could experience a notable upward movement. Market participants closely monitoring Avalanche have identified similarities between its current price pattern and other successful cryptocurrencies. In particular, the comparison with SOL, which experienced a significant surge after successfully breaking through a crucial resistance level, adds to the overall bullish sentiment surrounding AVAX. These comparisons contribute to the growing optimism within the market. Related Reading: PEPE Sees Sharp 17% Surge, But Will This Whale Spoil The Party? While the accumulation of AVAX and the anticipation of a breakout are encouraging signs, it is essential to acknowledge the highly volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and the potential influence of various market forces.
