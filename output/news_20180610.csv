42401615,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0Fmn,1528626631,Sex Workers Are Using Crypto to Save for Retirement,"MelissaSweet1, a camgirl in Arizona, started accepting cryptocurrency as payment for her erotic webcam performances three years ago. But usually, she would promptly convert it into fiat.  Until last year that is, when she started squirreling away the digital coins in a hardware wallet. Rather than simply an expedient way to get paid, crypto became a part of her retirement plan.  Like MelissaSweet1, several other sex workers recently interviewed by CoinDesk described similar shifts in their crypto usage. While others in the blockchain industry debate whether bitcoin is primarily a transactional currency or a global store of value, sex workers are already using the technology for both.  The trend speaks to both the surge in cryptocurrency prices, which has made it more rewarding to hold on to coins rather than cash out, and an intensification of the very problem that led the sex industry to turn to blockchain technology in the first place.  Namely, it's even harder than it was just six months ago for people in this line of work to get any kind of mainstream financial services in the U.S. – not just the payment processing that's long been elusive for them.  ""More banks are viewing any sex work as high risk, and an increasing number of banks are refusing to accept direct deposits from adult industry companies,"" said MelissaSweet1, who like other sex workers did not want to give her real name.  In such an environment, sex workers – a broad category that includes not only escorts but lawful workers such as erotic dancers, porn stars and even film production professionals – see saving money the old-fashioned way as increasingly risky because their accounts can be closed and funds frozen without warning. Some are afraid that centralized crypto services will start to do the same.  So, in addition to hodling the crypto they receive from clients, they're also moving their digital money offline from third-party services to cold storage methods under their control.  Adult performer and token enthusiast Brenna Sparks alluded to the new state of affairs in a tweet last month. Recounting a conversation with a makeup artist on set, Sparks wrote:  ""She happens to invest [in crypto] as well. 'I'm trying to retire.' I shook my head in agreement. 'Same.'""  Self-sovereign savings  But since retiring on crypto means securing it for years or even decades to come, these freelancers often evangelize in closed groups about the importance of cold storage. This is the practice of keeping the private key to a wallet – which is like a long, indecipherable and hard-to-remember password – offline, either on a piece of paper or a hardware device.  ""I've seen an increase,"" camgirl and adult film actress Ginger Banks, who has been in the industry for eight years, told CoinDesk about her peers discussing how to manage private keys. ""Just recently myself, people have been encouraging me to get my stuff off of Coinbase.""  As long as users control their private keys, their crypto cannot be confiscated, a risk that even legal sex workers face when they keep money in the bank.  ""The reason that security is taken so seriously by the adult industry is because they are so used having their accounts discontinued or frozen without warning by traditional centralized institutions,"" Nathan Smale, chief operating officer at the crypto startup Intimate, told CoinDesk.  ""You are dealing with women and men who have always had to take responsibility for their own safety and protection, rarely being able to rely on others to actually help them,"" Smale said. ""Is it any wonder that they would take control of their own funds and manage them?""  Even those who continue to use regulated, third-party services are hedging their bets. For instance, Leah, a 20-year-old sex worker who specializes in a form of BDSM, told CoinDesk she worries the government will create stricter regulations for cryptocurrency transactions, which would result in the kind of discrimination and account closures sex workers have long encountered from legacy financial providers.  So Leah uses a hardware wallet in addition to exchange accounts on sites like Coinbase. The flipside of cold storage, as seasoned crypto users know, is that key management can be stressful and involved. If lose your key, or forget the PIN or the recovery passphrase for a hardware wallet, you'll never be able to access your money.  ""Cryptocurrency is something still pretty new, it's decentralized so you have to hold yourself more responsible,"" MelissaSweet1 said.  More to come  Despite the headaches involved, the trend among sex workers of using crypto to save for retirement looks likely to grow, as an unintended consequence of recently enacted and pending legislation.  First, there was the SESTA/FOSTA legislation package that passed in the U.S. in March, which conflated consensual sex work with sex trafficking, and weakened legal protections for internet service providers (including online financial platforms) used by sex workers.  While traditional banks and payment networks like Visa have been inhospitable to sex workers for at least a decade, these new laws gave them one more reason to fear for their reputations if they come anywhere near the industry. Now there is another bill working its way through Congress, which could criminalize providing banking services for ""traffickers.""  ""These laws do pose a real threat to me,"" MelissaSweet1 said.  But that's not to say these crypto users want to break the law. Indeed, while naysayers may be quick to point out that saving for retirement without a licensed service provider could lend itself to tax evasion, blogs and social networks for sex workers are full of freelancers sharing tips on how to file taxes – including taxes on bitcoin payments.  ""There is a way to report income even when you're doing something that might be, in some states or locations, outside the law,"" Mike Stabile, communications director at the Free Speech Coalition, a nonprofit adult industry trade organization, told CoinDesk. ""Those people who are working in sex work do pay taxes. They do have deductions.""  To that point, MelissaSweet1 said she has been checking all her legal compliance boxes while working in the adult entertainment industry for the past five years and plans to continue doing so because she is proud of her work.  Besides, she said:  ""To my knowledge, there are no retirement services that specifically cater to sex workers.""  Looking ahead, some sex workers are thinking about other potential wealth-building applications for blockchain technology. For example, Ginger Banks said she hopes to someday establish her own studio using smart contracts to send royalties (which are rare in the adult entertainment industry) directly to individual cryptocurrency wallets for long-term income throughout retirement.  ""It feels like I am a part of history if I hold these coins for the future,"" Banks said.

42401623,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd0Fsh,1528623633,The Top 5 Ethereum Dapps By Daily Active Users,"From the mists of ideation, a first wave of ethereum dapps is starting to emerge.  Launched in 2015 with the promise that developers could use its technology as a ""secure backbone"" for a new kind of software application, ethereum has long held the promise of enabling such innovations, all ""without any possibility of downtime, censorship or third-party interference.""  So far, however, this vision has largely fueled an explosion of fundraising through initial coin offerings (ICOs), in which ethereum-based tokens were sold as the native currency for applications that were ostensibly being built, but in many cases have yet to see a real launch.  In other words, there is plenty of fodder for the narrative that while ICOs will welcome your money right now, real, working dapps are always a day away. And yet a few dapps are starting to attract active daily users in the hundreds and thousands.  These dapps have a few things in common. The top five – Idex, ForkDelta, Bancor, CryptoKitties and LocalEthereum – all facilitate trades of crypto assets in one way or another, though they have a range of business models, from exchange to game to market maker.  Successful projects also tend to have a relatively intuitive user experience, something dapps in general struggle with. Michael Foster, co-founder of LocalEthereum, said, ""We deliberately designed LocalEthereum to look and feel like an ordinary website.""  Bancor's director of communications Nate Hindman echoed that sentiment, saying the dapp was ""built with simplicity in mind."" And Bryce Bladon, a co-founder of CryptoKitties, attributed that dapp's success to the fact that it ""managed to introduce consumers to the blockchain in a way that was fun, interesting, and accessible."" (He mentioned cat puns as a specific example.)  Contributing to their ease of use, none of these dapps requires the use a native token. Bancor and Aurora Labs – Idex's parent company – have conducted ICOs, but owning these tokens isn't required.  For all these dapps' relative success, it must be said: daily userbases of a few hundred or a few thousand are laughably small compared to those of the biggest centralized apps – Facebook has well over a billion daily active users.  Asked to explain this disparity, Hindman remarked, ""Building apps that are not only decentralized but run like popular consumer web apps is no small feat and requires underlying infrastructure that is still in its infancy.""  Bladon said something similar: ""centralized solutions are difficult to outperform in terms of convenience. They're faster, familiar, and entrenched.""  He continued:  ""Compared to Amazon Web Services, processing on ethereum is 150 million times more expensive.""  Not that dapp-lovers should despair. That decentralized applications have even modest userbases, Bladon suggested, shows ""the incredible value people place on trustless computation.""  And dapps are still in their infancy, after all. ""The blockchain world is quickly catching up to its aspirations,"" said Hindman, at the same time as consumers are ""awakening to the power of decentralization.""  As data breaches and centralized parties' other lapses pile up, he predicted, users ""will flock to decentralized services in droves.""  Until then, below are the top five ethereum dapps by number of daily active users, with data sourced from DappRadar. (Editor's note: The ranking can be volatile, so this list is based on a snapshot taken Tuesday afternoon.)  1. Idex  Idex had 6,479 users in the 24 hours prior to our snapshot, making it the most-used ethereum dapp in that period.  Idex is a decentralized exchange offered by Aurora, a firm that has developed a series of financial services dapps. The exchange went live in October and experienced rapid growth in January, Aurora CEO Alex Wearn told Craig Cobb's Trader Cobb Crypto Podcast in May. It offers trades between ether and ERC-20 tokens.  Wearn explained on the podcast that ""you've got these digital assets that can move in a peer-to-peer fashion,"" but added that users of centralized exchanges such as Binance, GDAX and Kraken, have ""given control of the cryptocurrency over to the exchange operator."" The practical implications of that decision, he added, are ""the risk of hacking and theft.""  Idex, by contrast, uses a ""publicly verifiable"" ethereum smart contract, Wearn continued. In its current form, however, Idex is not entirely decentralized, as Aurora's white paper explains. Idex's centralized server is used at various steps of the process, such as queueing transactions in the order book. The white paper references a planned ""fully decentralized version"" of the platform.  2. ForkDelta  ForkDelta had 2,221 users in the 24 hours prior to our snapshot, making it the second most-used ethereum dapp in that period.  Similar to Idex, ForkDelta is a decentralized exchange offering trading in ether and ERC-20 tokens. Arseniy Ivanov started the project in January as a fork EtherDelta, another decentralized exchange. He cited the departure of EtherDelta founder Zack Coburn and ""the fact that EtherDelta has strayed from the original spirit of the project.""  As with Idex, ForkDelta's order book is centralized, although decentralizing that aspect of the exchange, as well as its hosting, is listed on the project's roadmaphttps://forkdelta.github.io/about/. ForkDelta continues to use EtherDelta's smart contract for now, meaning that fees on the ForkDelta platform still go to EtherDelta.  3. Bancor  Bancor had 560 users in the 24 hours prior to our snapshot, making it the third most-used ethereum dapp in that period.  Hindman disputed that number, however, telling CoinDesk that the daily active userbase is ""significantly larger"" than what DappRadar shows; he declined to reveal Bancor's estimate. (DappRadar founder Skirmantas Januskas said that he is in contact with Bancor and ""will see what we can do to make sure the data is 100 percent accurate."")  Bancor is a market maker that allows users to exchange ether and a growing number of ERC-20 tokens – 100 as of this week – but unlike a traditional exchange, it does not match buyers and sellers. Instead, Bancor's protocol aims to provide liquidity between different ethereum-based assets using ""smart tokens,"" which Bancor says create a ""built-in liquidity mechanism"" through smart contracts.  Bancor raised $150 million last year selling the first of these smart tokens, BNT, in an ICO.  4. CryptoKitties  CryptoKitties had 408 users in the 24 hours prior to our snapshot, making it the fourth most-used ethereum dapp in that period.  CryptoKitties, which spun out of Axiom Zen in March, has arguably attracted more attention than any other dapp: from players, media, investors, imitators, and non-users who felt the effects of CryptoKitties' popularity due to increased congestion on the ethereum network. According to estimates by Bloxy, CryptoKitties' daily userbase (measured by distinct senders) has fallen by around 97 percent since its peak in December.  The game allows users to collect, trade and breed unique, non-replicable cats. These are in fact ERC-721 tokens, ethereum-based assets that, according to CryptoKitties co-founder Arthur Camara, could eventually be used to tokenize real-world assets such as art and real estate.  Bladon told CoinDesk that CryptoKitties receives far more users on its site than directly through its smart contract, which is the only source DappRadar references. The fact that only a portion of CryptoKitties players interact with the game through the smart contract itself hints at something larger: CryptoKitties is not as decentralized as the ""dapp"" label suggests.  As CoinDesk reported in December, ""the game is run within a centralized database, and mostly operates from one internet portal – the CryptoKitties website itself.""  5. LocalEthereum  LocalEthereum had 236 users in the 24 hours prior to our snapshot, making it the fifth most-used ethereum dapp in that period.  LocalEthereum facilitates trades of ether between individuals, much as LocalBitcoins did for bitcoin. The similar name is not a coincidence: ""People have been asking, 'is there a LocalEthereum?' even before we announced ourselves last year,"" Foster told CoinDesk.  LocalEthereum functions via an escrow smart contract, which locks up the seller's ether until the seller certifies that they've received the money from the buyer – whether through an in-person cash handoff, a bank transfer, or another method.  In the event of a dispute, the smart contract specifies an arbitrator (for now, only LocalEthereum, but perhaps eventually other reputable parties). The arbitrator can award the ether to one of those two parties, but not to anyone else – for example, themselves.  5 image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,David Floyd,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/06/10/the-top-5-ethereum-dapps-by-daily-active-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d300c0d1a30db91097e7325dfce02c960081734-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
