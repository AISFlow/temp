42398942,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjL5,1458589369,Bitcoin Remains Most Popular Digital Currency on Dark Web,"Two professors at the Department of War Studies at King’s College London have published the results of their deep dive into The Onion Router, or Tor, network, which is designed to make it difficult to track the activity of online users.  The study found that websites offered illicit goods and services in 12 categories, including finance, and that bitcoin was still the digital currency of choice for conducting a wide range of other transactions.  “Bitcoin is the most common currency employed in all Tor hidden-services trade,” wrote Daniel Moore, a cyber-threat intelligence engineer in the Department of War Studies.  The report, ""Cryptopolitik and the Darknet,” which appeared in the February-March edition of Survival: Global Politics and Strategy, analyzed about 300,000 web addresses, identifying 5,205 live websites, out of which 2,723 were classified as illicit with a “high degree of confidence.”  Of those, each was placed in one of twelve categories, including drugs, arms, and finance. The drugs category was the most frequently identified, with 423 websites, followed by finance with 327 websites. 1,021 websites were categorized as “other” by the research team.  Among the financial websites identified as illicit, there were three categories: bitcoin-based methods for money-laundering, stolen credit card numbers and trade in counterfeit currency.  Since the closure of the Silk Road in October 2013, the anonymity of Tor has been widely questioned. In October 2014 academics at the University of Luxembourg found that even with a combination of bitcoin and Tor, a user’s anonymity could be revealed with an attack costing about $2,500. Recent reporting from Motherboard indicates that the US government has, with the aid of researchers, identified ways of reducing anonymity within the Tor network.  But according to the latest report, coin-mixing services such as CleanCoin, which has been around since the end of 2013, can offer a sense of security by providing users change for their bitcoin from a wide variety of sources “making it almost impossible,” according to the site, to track the point of origin.  The report’s authors, which also included King's College professor and technology author Thomas Rid, crawled addresses featuring .onion during a two-month period between January and March 2015, scanning a maximum of 100 pages per site to help prevent bias as a result of particularly large sites.

42398950,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjTw,1458584008,DTCC Open to Business Model Changes in Face of Blockchain Disruption,"The company that last year processed $1.6 quadrillion in securities has a lot to lose if it is cut out of the financial food chain.  As a result, the Depository Trade & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has been working diligently for the past several months to position itself at the center of a wide-range of experiments other companies are conducting with blockchain technology.  Instead of fighting against the distributed ledger technology popularized by bitcoin, the DTCC has embraced the new tool and is doing what it can to help define the future architecture of the industry, even if that means changing the company business model.  Robert Palatnick, chief technology architect at DTCC, told CoinDesk:  ""Part of our responsibility of helping the industry to innovate is [looking at] how to bring distributed ledgers into consideration for solving some industry problems. If it means we modify our business model to accommodate that, then that's the way the industry uses us.""  The DTCC charges account fees to its users in addition to recurring monthly fees and processing fees. With total securities processed in excess of $1qn per year, its fees that average in the fractions of a cent added up to $1.4bn in its most recent annual report.  But the blockchain’s ability — in theory — to let the corporation’s customers conduct post-trade solutions on their own could force a change.  Blockchain education  To educate itself on the potential disruption, the DTCC joined the non-profit Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project in December 2015, and its systems director Pardha Vishnumolakala is now on the project's technical steering committee.  Though still in early stages, the Hyperledger Project aims to offer open-source financial solutions using blockchain tech.  But that was just the beginning of the company's push, Palatnick said.  A month later, DTCC joined the largest investment to date in a non-bitcoin blockchain company and published a white paper in which it wrote that ""uncoordinated"" research into blockchain applications puts the industry ""at risk of repeating the past and creating countless new siloed solutions based on different standards.""  Palatnick sees the DTCC’s role as a coordinator of cooperation to help ensure those silos don't exist in what may be an entirely new financial paradigm. He says he takes a phone call at least every other day from different vendors conducting experiments using various blockchains building pilot tests of technology to streamline mortgage loans, syndicated loans and equity settlements, among others.  ""Some of the organizations are contacting us because they feel we can help them in a variety of different ways,"" Palatnick said, adding:  ""Whether that’s supporting their use-cases, or bringing the appropriate industry risk perspective of how do you lower the right level of risk to implement a particular use-case.""  The experiments  Palatnick wouldn’t mention the specific banks and other institutions with which DTCC is in communication, but he did say experiments are being conducted to integrate blockchain tech into big data infrastructures, an effort which could make identifying past transactions as easy as doing a search on Google.  Frequently the experiments are in what the DTCC calls ""white areas"" where settlement times average about three days but can take months to close. Last week, during a roundtable attended by 500 of DTCC's clients, the company discussed its goal to cut the settlement time to two days by 5th September, 2017.  According to Palatnick, the DTCC — a private company owned by some of the banks that use it — isn't pushing for a single blockchain which it can manage, but a ""fabric"" of different ledgers — each decentralized in its own way and plugged into his company's layer of post-trade services.  Indeed, the potentially disruptive impact of the blockchain on the global securities industry has led to some interesting, even surprising, collaborations.  Just three months ago New York City-based Digital Asset Holdings announced that DTCC and its British competitor, ICAP, had each participated in what was then a $50m Series A investment in the company that was later increased to $60m.  As part of that investment Michael Bodson, president and CEO of DTCC joined Digital Asset's board of directors.  Though the actual experiments with which DTCC is assisting remain a secret, we got hint about the kinds of work it might be conducting last week when fellow Digital Asset investor, ICAP, announced it had completed an internal blockchain test aimed at post-trade processes.  Resistance and survival  In spite of all the research into building blockchain tech into the old way of clearing and settling trades, one co-founder whose company’s business model is also impacted by decentralized ledgers thinks DTCC's effort might be for nothing.  ""They have to do something,"" said Jim Mullen, chief technology officer of Firm58, which manages exchange fees for the New York Stock Exchange and other US equities and options exchanges. ""They have to look at the tech. But in the back of their mind they need to remember the spirit of the blockchain is to make it so they’re not necessary.”  Mullen, whose company helps its customers stay compliant by curating and analyzing their data, says there may yet be a way for the DTCC to offer a blockchain but remain relevant.  He says the firm could implement a decentralized ledger that eliminates the need for broker-dealers, but still needs to be funded, hosted and maintained by a centralized, experienced authority. ""Maybe that’s their role,"" he added.  As it turns out, the DTCC has a history of surviving and thriving amidst technological disruption.  Founded with its current name in 1999, the company is the result of a merger between the Depository Trust Company (DTC) and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), both of which were founded after the 1968 Wall Street paperwork crisis.  At the time, accelerating exchange rates made the old way of trading physical documents untenable and the organizations built technology that helped digitize the process. Now in 139 countries, the DTCC processes more than 100 million digital transactions a day.  In spite of that experience, and the research his firm is helping conduct, Palatnick acknowledges that with every call he takes from a vendor conducting a blockchain experiment he learns more about how the technology might impact his own company’s bottom line.  Palatnick concluded:  ""I would love to be able to hit that fast forward button and see what things are going to look like in a year. So I’d be able to aim all our resources at it.""

42398938,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjH9,1458568968,Rootstock Raises $1 Million to Bring Smart Contracts to Bitcoin,"Blockchain startup RSK Labs has raised $1m in seed funding to support the development of Rootstock, a smart contracts platform that would be developed as a sidechain on the bitcoin blockchain.  Bitcoin mining company Bitmain Technology led the round, which also drew support from bitcoin and blockchain focused investment companies Coinsilium and Digital Currency Group (DCG).  In an interview, RSK Labs CEO Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar said that the goal of the project was to build a blockchain network that would attract support from both bitcoin miners as well as developers of smart contract applications attracted to platforms like Ethereum.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Our idea is to leverage everything that has been built by the community so far. Not only on the network effect of bitcoin, because the miners will have an additional revenue stream by merge-mining Rootstock, but by providing Ethereum developers a place to build their applications.""  While noting that Rootstock shares similarities with Ethereum, Zaldivar argued that as time goes on, the Rootstock network will diverge and grow based on what he described as a process of pursuing real use cases, particularly those related to financial services.  An alternative blockchain platform, Ethereum has gained momentum in recent weeks after completing its first production launch, an update that now enables new innovations for smart contracts.  By comparison, Rootstock is set to launch a private testnet by the end of April, followed by the release of a beta in September. The goal, according to Zaldivar, is to launch a production blockchain by the end of this year that would then leverage bitcoin's network effect.  The new funding will be used to support the completion of RSK Labs' technical plans.  Bitmain CEO Wu Jihan said in a press statement that he sees Rootstock as a driver of future growth in smart contract development.  ""Rootstock is the most exciting opportunity for me among the startups in the bitcoin ecosystem. The tidal wave of startups developing smart contract solutions based on RSK will bring countless miracles,"" he said.

42398935,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhjFB,1458530973,Australian Government Seeks End to Double Taxation of Bitcoin,"The Australian government has announced that it will back a legislative solution to tax concerns surrounding bitcoin as part of a broad policy statement on financial technology.  Under current tax guidance in the country, bitcoin is considered a form of barter rather than a form of money. Australian businesses must pay goods-and-services tax (GST) if they sell digital currencies, and can be liable for the tax should they receive them as payment.  This policy has sparked criticism from the startup community in Australia, who argue it creates an unfair tax environment. Last summer, the Australian Senate called for proposals to resolve the problem in a report on digital currencies.  The government said today that it will work with the digital currency industry in Australia to find a solution, stating:  “The Government recognises that that the current treatment of digital currency under GST law means that consumers are ‘double taxed’ when using digital currency to buy anything already subject to GST. The Government is committed to addressing the ‘double taxation’ of digital currencies and will work with the industry on legislative options to reform the law relating to GST as it is applied to digital currencies.”  Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said today that the government ""won't be taxing digital currencies"", according to the Australian Financial Review.  The statements came in a wide-ranging policy statement on FinTech released by the Australian government. The statement offered new details on how the government plans to regulate companies working on new financial technologies as well as digital currencies and blockchain applications in particular.  The government wants to ease rules for investors and startups in the FinTech space, the latter of whom would be afforded flexibility within a ""regulatory sandbox"" approach. An advisory group dedicated to FinTech issues has also been formed, chaired by Westpac Bank director Craig Dunn.  “Removing the ‘double taxation’ treatment for GST on digital currencies and applying adequate anti‑money laundering and counter‑terrorism financing rules may facilitate further developments or use in the future,” the government said.  Legislative plans for distributed ledgers  The country’s anti-money laundering regulator, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, voiced its support for blockchain technology in a statement included in the policy release, stating that it believes the tech could ""significantly reduce the costs of compliance and regulation imposed on reporting entities"".  Notably, the regulator said that it will seek new rules governing the use of distributed ledgers in financial services.  ""This new technology can ensure that sensitive financial data used for intelligence purposes remains secure, transparent and protected through the use and application of encryption,"" AUSTRAC said, going on to explain:  “For such a system to be resilient to systemic risk or criminal exploitation, two levels of complementary regulatory approaches will be required: a high-level guiding legislative framework; and a set of agreed rules that determine the operation of the algorithms encoded by the software.”  AUSTRAC did not indicate when it would develop these new regulations, saying that this process would involve the participation of “stakeholders”.  Government debating AML rules  Elsewhere in the policy release, the government indicated that it continues to weigh whether to apply financial surveillance rules to digital currency exchange services in the country.  The Australian Attorney-General’s Department, according to the release, is in the process of evaluating whether existing anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations should be amended to cover domestic exchanges. The move is framed as an application of those regulations to all FinTech startups in Australia.  “The current review of Australia’s anti‑money laundering and counter‑terrorism financing (AML/CTF) regime is considering a range of measures to support the development of the FinTech industry,” the government said. “The review is considering whether AML/CTF regulation should be extended to include convertible digital currency exchanges.”  The office said that it is “considering how to make the obligations under the AML/CTF regime technology neutral”, and plans to submit a report to Australian Department of Justice on possible approaches.  Blockchain support  The Australian government said that it is seeking to support businesses that develop and use FinTech, making particular note of the Australian business sector’s growing interest in blockchain technology.  It singled out the Australian Securities Exchange, which is looking into possible applications to its market structure and recently invested in blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings.  The government said:  “While it is in the early stages of development, the technology has the potential to radically simplify the way our market operates end‑to‑end, with significant benefits to investors, participants, regulators and government agencies.""

42426712,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9bh,1458524675,Elliptic Raises $5 Million to Expand Bitcoin Surveillance Tools,"Bitcoin surveillance startup Elliptic has raised $5m in Series A funding in a round that involved a private equity firm with strong US defense and intelligence connections.  Paladin Capital Group led the round, which also drew support from Santander InnoVentures, KRW Schindler, Digital Currency Group and Octopus Ventures, an existing investor in the firm.  Paladin counts former National Security Agency director and retired Lieutenant General Kenneth Minihan among its leadership. The firm, according to its website, invests primarily in companies focused on defense, cybersecurity and intelligence products and services.  Minihan indicated that Paladin would lobby for Elliptic’s blockchain intelligence tools to gain broader usage among US law enforcement agencies, remarking in a statement:  “We recognise that the firm’s monitoring capability will be an essential component of any blockchain in the future and we will help Elliptic to expand in the US, via our contacts and knowledge of US law enforcement and government agencies.”  UK-based Elliptic raised $2m in seed funding in 2014 after launching an insured bitcoin storage service in January of that year.  Elliptic co-founder and CEO Dr. James Smith said that the round will help support Elliptic's expansion plans.  “Our new investors bring deep expertise in law enforcement, international financial services, and blockchain technology and we are excited to work with them on our next phase of growth,” he said. “We have already been able to expand operations to the US and will continue to extend our portfolio of products.”  The funding comes as some global regulators, particularly in Europe, look to expand oversight of bitcoin transactions, particularly in connection with exchanges that trade digital currencies for government-issued currencies. In February, the European Commission said it wanted to undertake a process of ""ending the anonymity associated with such exchanges"".
