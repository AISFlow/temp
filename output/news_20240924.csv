However, while holders are barely up double digits over the past week, a meme coin trader on Solana is swimming in profits at spot rates. MooDeng Trader Turns $800 To $1.3 Million According to Arkham, a blockchain intelligence platform, the trader, who got in early, scooping $800 worth of MooDeng, a meme coin in Solana, has seen the investment swell to over $1.3 million roughly two weeks after buying. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Short Squeeze as Bitcoin Futures Market Heats Up The address, also the largest holder of the MoonDeng meme coin, had already seen the initial investment soar by over 500X by September 17, rising to nearly $400,000. However, a week later, that same investment is up, rising to $1.3 million on September 24. A glance at MooDeng’s price action shows that the token is inching higher. Notably, this superb performance coincides with a sharp change in fundamental factors following the interest cut by the United States Federal Reserve. Following the 50 basis point reduction, Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin have been firm, shaking off weakness. Specifically, the revival of Solana prices from September lows has been a reprieve for some of its ecosystem tokens, especially meme coins. Solana Meme Coin Ecosystem Recovering Over the last week, Solana has added nearly 11%, according to Coingecko data. The expansion has also seen the total market cap of Solana meme coins rise to $7.2 billion, adding 8% in the past 24 hours. Out of this, DogWifHat (WIF) is the largest meme coin on Solana, commanding a market cap of over $1.8 billion. However, the only other meme coin on this network with a market cap exceeding $1 billion is Bonk, at $1.2 billion.

Currently, looking at Coingecko, MooDeng is up 48% over the last day, attracting a 24-hour trading volume of over $29.4 million. Gecko Terminal data shows over 9,800 holders, and each token is changing hands at around $0.06, translating to over $63 million in market cap.

The development follows a lengthy discussion on the Sky discussion forum with Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo, which was the sole custodian of the bitcoin backing WBTC until August, when a deal was cut to transfer custody to a strategic partnership with Tron founder Justin Sun.  WBTC is a token that allows investors to use bitcoin (BTC) on other blockchains, such as Ethereum, and often is at the center of the DeFi lending space as collateral. WBTC currently has a $9.7 billion market capitalization.  The influential Sky adviser, BA Labs, had expressed concerns about Sun's involvement with the project – a crucial consideration given that some $200 million of loans on the platform were in some way linked to WBTC collateral. Last week, Sky community members overwhelmingly voted to proceed with the adviser's recommendation to offboard WBTC as collateral, in a five-step process starting in early October.  But discussions over the matter continued even after the vote, with Belshe posting extensively in the forum in recent days that the new custody arrangement was misunderstood, and that Sun would not have the ability to singlehandedly make changes to the structure.  ""They will not 'have the ability to direct changes to key management practices' at BitGo or BitGo Singapore,"" two of the entities overseeing the multi-signature keys controlling the new custodian, Belshe wrote on Sept. 20.  Then on Tuesday, BA Labs wrote that ""the additional details and clarity put us in a more comfortable position with the current state of WBTC operations and key management.""  The advisor noted that collateral exposure to WBTC had ""fallen somewhat to current levels around $170 million of total borrowing,"" reducing the risk to a ""more acceptable range.""  ""While we continue to have concerns about BitGlobal serving as a signer for WBTC, we find it is no longer at a level requiring immediate collateral offboarding,"" BA Labs wrote. ""Therefore, we recommend indefinitely pausing the collateral offboarding procedures.""  Wrapped bitcoin alternatives  Sun, in response to some of the concerns raised about his involvement with the project, had told CoinDesk that WBTC has a ""sterling track record that is unmatched by any competing offers recently floated by the skeptics.""  The drama around wrapped bitcoin has energized competitors offering alternative versions of the token, including dlcBTC, Threshold's tBTCand FBTC, which has the support of Mantle Network.

33947974,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644249,1727213458,"Shiba Inu Symmetrical Triangle Pattern Reappears, Why A 200% Rally Is Possible","Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be on its way to reclaim former price highs, as a crypto analyst identified as the ‘Charting Guy’ has confirmed the reappearance of a unique symmetrical triangle pattern on the SHIB price chart. A breakout from this symmetrical triangle could see Shiba Inu potentially rallying above 200% from its current price. Shiba Inu Triangle Pattern Points To Breakout On September 23, Charting Guy took to X (formerly Twitter) to unveil a new trend pattern in Shiba Inu’s price chart. The chart highlighted three wave patterns and several Fibonacci retracement levels which acted as resistance and support zones for Shiba Inu’s price. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 8,500% Rally For Cardano To Reach $31 As Indicators Turn Bullish In classic wave 1 and 2, Shiba Inu’s price movements exhibited a series of fluctuations, followed by a brief upward momentum before sliding downwards again. Now in wave 3 which the analyst has predicted would be an explosive one, Shiba Inu has formed a historical symmetrical triangle pattern which could trigger a potential surge to new highs at $0.0.0000493, representing a 244% rally. Currently, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.0000143, with its next key resistance at the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, near $0.0000164. If the meme coin fails to surpass this resistance, the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.000011 could provide strong support. In contrast, if Shiba Inu exceeds resistance levels at $0.0000164, the cryptocurrency could see its price breakout to $0.0000226. More resistance can also be seen at Fibonacci retracement levels around 0.618 and 0.702, representing the $0.0000312 and $0.0000392 price marks, respectively. If Shiba Inu can successfully break out of these key levels, the cryptocurrency would experience an explosive surge to $0.0000493, a price level well above its previous March high of around $0.000045. Interestingly, this price level is not the highest Shiba Inu can reach based on its symmetrical triangle pattern. According to the Charting Guy, if SHIB can break above the 0.888 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0000651, the meme coin could potentially skyrocket to new all-time highs at $0.0000884, corresponding to the 1 Fibonacci retracement level and marking a massive rally of approximately 518%. However, in the event that Shiba Inu fails to surpass this key level, it is likely to find support at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level of $0.00004936. Related Reading: Diamond Hand Ethereum Whale Moves 15,000 ETH, Here’s The Destination SHIB Price Analysis Supporting the optimism surrounding Shiba Inu’s future outlook, the cryptocurrency has been on a steady upward trajectory. In the past week, the price of Shiba Inu increased by an impressive 8.91%. However, it has recently retraced some of those gains, experiencing a 1.52% decline in the last 24 hours. Earlier in March, Shiba Inu witnessed a significant rally, positioning it as one of the top gainers. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has seen a staggering 95.65% price increase since the start of 2024.

Bitcoin took aim at rising past $65,000 for the first time since early August.  A breakout above the $65,000 level is likely necessary to confirm a bull move, said one analyst.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} took aim at more than a one-month high during U.S. afternoon trading hours on Tuesday as the tailwind of what's shaping up to be a near global monetary easing cycle continued to push crypto markets higher.  Bitcoin at press time was ahead nearly 2% over the past 24 hours at $64,300. The price hasn't been above $65,000 since the first week in August.  China overnight joined nearly all other major global economies in easing monetary policy to combat a slowdown in the economy. The news sent the Shanghai Composite higher by more than 4%, but provided only a small and brief bump in the price of bitcoin.  Prices actually dipped under $63,000 in the U.S. morning hours after the Conference Board reported a sharp decline in consumer confidence in September, its headline index tumbling to 98.7 from 105.6 – the steepest monthly fall since August 2021. ""Consumers’ assessments of current business conditions turned negative while views of the current labor market situation softened further,"" said the Conference Board's Dana Peterson. ""Consumers were also more pessimistic about future labor market conditions and less positive about future business conditions and future income.""  The news though, sent expectations of the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark interest rate by another 50 basis points at its November meeting to 61% from 50% a day earlier, according to CME FedWatch.  Shortly after, the latest figures showed a sizable jump in the U.S. M2 money supply in August. The combination of easier China and U.S. monetary policies and rising money supply appeared to be the catalyst for bitcoin's sustained rise throughout afternoon trading. Gold too, liked the news, jumping 1.4% to yet another record high of $2,690 per ounce.  With today's advance, bitcoin is now higher by more than 10% from week-ago levels, but it's hard to say there's been an upside breakout when the price remains below the level of just a few weeks ago.  ""Very psychologically difficult to flip from looking to trim on pops during chop to letting your winners ride,"" wrote well-followed analyst Will Clemente.

42417190,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTQaz7,1727208503,Ex-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison Sentenced to Two Years in Prison for Her Role in FTX Fraud,"NEW YORK — Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison was sentenced to 24 months – or two years – in prison by a federal judge on Tuesday.  The judge said Ellison, 29, who will also have to forfeit about $11 billion, could serve the sentence at a minimum-security facility near Boston, where her family lives. She will also spend three years on supervised release after she serves her term.  Despite the sentence, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan seemed sympathetic to Ellison, who was a key witness in the government’s trial against Sam Bankman-Fried – the founder and CEO of FTX and a former boyfriend of Ellison’s. ""You were vulnerable and you were exploited,"" he said minutes before announcing his sentence. ""You are genuinely remorseful.""  Kaplan noted Ellison’s cooperation, saying ""I’ve seen a lot of cooperators in 30 years here, I’ve never seen one quite like Miss Ellison.""  Read all of CoinDesk's coverage here.  Nevertheless, FTX was one of the greatest financial frauds ever perpetrated in this country, he noted, and cooperation wasn’t enough to spare Ellison a spot in prison. ""In a case this serious, to be literally a 'get out of jail free' card is not something I can see my way through to,"" Kaplan said, before asking Ellison to rise and receive her sentence of 24 months in prison. Because the crime is federal, Ellison will serve at least 75% of her sentence before being eligible for parole.  Ellison testified against Bankman-Fried during his criminal trial last year, alleging he tried to bribe foreign officials and deliberately shared misleading financial data with lenders.  Her testimony was a ""cornerstone"" in Bankman-Fried's conviction, prosecutors said in a sentencing memorandum ahead of Tuesday's hearing. Bankman-Fried was convicted on all seven counts of fraud and conspiracy he faced, and was sentenced to 25 years in prison earlier this year. He's now appealing the conviction. Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, one of the prosecutors who spearheaded Bankman-Fried's trial, echoed this memo during remarks on Tuesday before the judge.  Unlike Bankman-Fried, Ellison was proactively cooperative with the Department of Justice, she said. It was not the first time she – or other speakers Tuesday – contrasted the pair. Where Bankman-Fried did not demonstrate remorse, Ellison did, and while Bankman-Fried's sentence was intended to deter him and others from committing any further crimes, Ellison's sentence should reflect her cooperation, she said.  Ellison's own attorneys argued ahead of the hearing that she provided ""extraordinary cooperation"" and did not pose any recidivism risk. Both her attorneys and the probation department recommended that she be sentenced to time served, plus three years of probation.  Ellison’s lawyer, Wilmer Hale Managing Partner Anjan Sahni, told the court that his client had been led astray by Bankman-Fried, who she formerly had a romantic relationship with. In her desire to please Bankman-Fried, Ellison participated in the fraud scheme but after FTX’s collapse, her lawyer said, ""she has recovered her moral compass.""  Ellison, who spoke briefly before the sentence was read out, said she wanted to apologize to FTX and Alameda's former customers, her former colleagues, friends and family.  ""The human brain is bad at comprehending big numbers,"" she said, her voice wavering. ""I can't even begin to imagine the pain I've caused.""  Ellison has approximately 45 days before she is required to surrender herself voluntarily to the Bureau of Prisons to begin serving her sentence.  ""If you had told me back in 2018 that I would end up pleading guilty to fraud, I would have told you you were crazy,"" Ellison added. ""At each stage of the process it became harder and harder to extricate myself…I’m sorry I wasn’t brave.""

Many of these projects are proving the critics wrong, despite others doubting their “shelf life.” Related Reading: Bitcoin To Outshine Gold By 400% By 2025, Veteran Analyst Predicts In the wake of Bonk’s ascent and its intention to introduce a Bonk ETP, Popcat has gained attention due to its most recent performance. Notably, CoinCodex has taken notice and has predicted that POPCAT’s price would grow significantly as long as its trading volume keeps increasing. Trade Volume Record Popcat’s trade volume increased by more than 128% in the last day, propelling it to the top of the CoinGecko charts. Its price has increased by an amazing 35% in the past week, demonstrating the great level of interest and activity surrounding the coin. Given the level of competition in the digital currency market, it is by no means a small achievement to witness such an activity boom. Curious to see how far this meme coin might grow by 2024, investors are closely keepin an eye on it. Popcat is now closer to $1. From the time of writing, CoinMarketCap displays an 18% surge in value in the 24-hour timeframe. The coin’s value has incrementally been rising since its launch in March 2024. Positive Signs The level of open interest has just reached an all-time high, which is indicative of a rise in the number of traders that are engaging. The fact that funding rates are still high lends credence to the expectation that this cryptocurrency with a cat motif will continue to rise. How high can Popcat truly go now that all of these signs point to a continuing rising trajectory? Analyst optimism is on the cautious side. Forecasts indicate that POPCAT could reach $2 by the end of the year, giving early investors a gain of over 100% if market conditions remain positive. Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Explodes By 81% – Is $530 The Next Target? Navigating Market Vibes Even with all of Popcat’s hype, market sentiment right now is a mixture of caution and hope. By October 24, 2024, CoinCodex projects an astounding price increase of 228%, with a possible peak of $3.01. For the past month Popcat observed 50% of its trading days in the green and 17% price volatility. This statistics point to a relatively dynamic yet steady market environment. Popcat’s steady performance and the growing interest in Solana’s memecoins paint an encouraging picture. The combination of trading volume, positive market indicators, and bullish forecasts suggest that Popcat could be a worthwhile investment.

The related companies were also said to offer and sell securities tied to TUSD without registering with the SEC.  TrustToken and TrueCoin – now rebranded and under the umbrella of Archbock – settled accusations that they knowingly misrepresented the backing of the TrueUSD {{TUSD}} stablecoin and offered securities tied to it without properly registering, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a Tuesday statement.  The California-based firms, which didn't admit or deny wrongdoing in settling with the SEC, had claimed TUSD enjoyed one-to-one dollar reserves when the stablecoin's issuer was instead investing in ""a speculative and risky offshore commodity fund,"" the agency said.  The companies agreed to pay $163,766 each in fines, and TrueCoin will return nearly $400,000 in profits and interest, assuming a federal court approves the settlement. They've also agreed not to violate the relevant securities law, the SEC said.  TrueCoin was the original issuer of TUSD, which later ended up in the hands of offshore firm Techteryx and has a current market cap of nearly half a billion dollars. TrustToken operated a ""so-called lending protocol,"" TrueFi, the SEC said. The entities in Tuesday's settlement are accused of engaging in unregistered offers and sales of securities involving TUSD through TrueFi, and the agency said they remained closely tied to the asset after unloading the stablecoin to the other issuer.

Both companies were said to be aware of redemption problems in 2022 with the popular stablecoin, the SEC said. Archblock didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment.  “TrueCoin and TrustToken sought profits for themselves by exposing investors to substantial, undisclosed risks through misrepresentations about the safety of the investment,” said Jorge G. Tenreiro, acting chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets & Cyber Unit, in a statement. “This case is a prime example of why registration matters, as investors in these products continue to be deprived of the key information needed to make fully informed decisions.”  At one point, more than 13% of TUSD were tied to profit-seeking opportunities on the TrueFi platform, according to the complaint.

42417183,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTQart,1727203962,Leveraging Bitcoin’s Security for Trustless Asset Transfers,"Bridges have consistently posed serious security risks, especially in connecting Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest blockchains. These ecosystems remain largely isolated from each other, and cross-chain bridges have repeatedly been vulnerable to hacks, resulting in billions of dollars in losses. What’s needed is a new approach — one that leverages Bitcoin's robust security to create non-custodial asset transfers between chains.  Current bridges often rely on centralized components and cryptographic systems that introduce single points of failure. When these bridges are compromised, user funds are immediately at risk. Instead of addressing the root causes, the industry has focused on increasingly complex solutions that only add more attack vectors. This approach has not solved the fundamental security flaws.  Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus has a decade-long track record of reliability. Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, we should be looking to Bitcoin as the foundation for secure cross-chain infrastructure. While some argue that Ethereum’s programmability makes it better suited for cross-chain activity, its complexity has led to numerous vulnerabilities, particularly in Ethereum-based bridges and Layer 2 solutions.  That said, Ethereum's flexibility is valuable for innovation, and its role shouldn’t be diminished. But when securing billions in cross-chain assets, Bitcoin’s proven security model is essential. By anchoring cross-chain tunnels to Bitcoin's blockchain through mechanisms like Proof-of-Proof (PoP), we can create a system that inherits Bitcoin’s resistance to attacks without modifying its core protocol.  This approach could enable secure, trustless asset transfers by using Bitcoin scripts and covenants for locking and unlocking assets across chains. While Bitcoin’s scripting language may be limited, it has been rigorously tested and remains a reliable foundation. Innovations like BitVM further demonstrate how Bitcoin's security can be extended to support complex cross-chain interactions.  Some argue that Bitcoin is too slow or inflexible for cross-chain infrastructure. However, in blockchain systems, speed and complexity often come at the cost of security. Bitcoin’s simplicity is a feature, not a drawback, making it an ideal trust anchor for cross-chain tunnels.  By periodically publishing state roots to Bitcoin, other chains could inherit Bitcoin’s security robustness, creating a scalable and secure foundation for cross-chain interoperability. This would allow other networks to benefit from Bitcoin's security without requiring changes to Bitcoin itself.  Building secure cross-chain infrastructure will take collaboration between developers from different ecosystems, along with new standards and practices. But the reward — achieving secure, trustless interoperability between Bitcoin and Ethereum — makes the effort worthwhile.  It’s time to stop viewing Bitcoin and Ethereum as competitors and recognize them as complementary parts of a broader ecosystem. By combining Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s programmability, we can build a more secure and functional blockchain network, with cross-chain tunnels offering a better alternative to the fragile bridges of the past.

33943686,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644260,1727202649,SUI Price Sits 40% Below All-Time High As TVL Approaches $1 Billion,"SUI has recently emerged as one of the top-performing altcoins, posting an impressive 120% surge since early September. This rapid price increase has captured the attention of both investors and analysts, as data from DefiLlama reveals that SUI’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is approaching the $1 billion mark. The rising TVL has fueled speculation that SUI could be on the brink of reaching a new all-time high, with many pointing to its growing ecosystem and increasing adoption as key factors driving its momentum. Related Reading: XRP $0.60 Triangle Breakout Could Ignite Parabolic Rally – Key Levels To Watch Currently, SUI is testing a critical resistance level, which, if broken, could trigger a surge in price that may challenge its all-time high of $2.18. As market conditions continue to evolve and interest in decentralized finance grows, many are watching SUI closely for its potential to lead the next altcoin rally. Should the resistance hold, the price may consolidate before making a stronger push higher. However, if bulls breakthrough, it could set the stage for a significant upward movement, positioning SUI as a standout performer in the crypto space. SUI Rising TVL Suggests Growing Demand SUI has ignited a wave of optimism among investors and traders who view the Layer-1 blockchain as poised to become one of the biggest winners in the ongoing bull run. Key metrics and insights from analysts reveal a growing interest in SUI, driven not only by retail investors but also by institutions pushing its price higher. On August 5, during a broader market crash, SUI’s Total Value Locked (TVL) plummeted to $342 million. However, since then, the blockchain has staged an impressive recovery, with its TVL surging nearly threefold to $885 million, according to data from DeFiLlama. TVL is a critical metric that reflects the total dollar value of assets staked or locked within a protocol. A decrease in TVL indicates liquidity is being withdrawn, while an increase, such as SUI’s 40% rise over the past 30 days, signals growing trust in the project and a healthier ecosystem. This sharp increase in TVL is a positive sign, suggesting that SUI’s network is attracting more liquidity and usage. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Surge 1,000% Past ATH – Price Targets Revealed Currently, the price of SUI is just 40% below its all-time high, creating an ideal setup for bulls who believe this project is poised for explosive growth. Many anticipate that SUI could be one of the breakout stars of this cycle, as its ecosystem continues to expand and investor confidence strengthens. Technical Levels To Watch SUI is now trading at $1.55 after a massive 60% rally since last Tuesday, showing strong momentum in the market. The price has increased with increasing volume, consolidating just below a key supply level—a sign of strength and confirmation of a bullish trend. Bulls must keep SUI above $1.40 to sustain momentum. Once a supply zone, this level may now act as a new demand zone. Consolidating above $1.40 could drive the price to higher levels, specifically toward $1.71. Reclaiming $1.71, a crucial supply zone, would position SUI to challenge its all-time high. Breaking through this level would set the stage for further price appreciation and possibly a new ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Signals ‘Shift To Bullish Territory’ – Can BTC Break Past $65,000? A deeper correction is possible if SUI loses its current price levels. Lower demand zones around $1.25 or even $1.17 might provide support. This would slow the rally, but the overall bullish outlook remains intact if the price stays within these key levels.

42417193,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTQb2D,1727199000,What to Expect at Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison's Sentencing,"Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison will learn her fate in a few hours. She may spend the next several months or years behind bars, but her attorneys, the Department of Justice and the Probation Office all seem to think she should remain a free woman after the amount of cooperation she provided.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  To jail, or not to jail  The narrative  Attorneys for former FTX group executive Caroline Ellison argue she shouldn't spend any time in prison after cooperating with prosecutors, FTX's bankruptcy estate and FTX's creditors. Prosecutors did not provide a specific recommendation, but moved for a below-guidelines sentence.  Why it matters  Caroline Ellison was the CEO of Alameda Research who, in her own words, doctored balance sheets that the FTX group sent to companies that loaned FTX money as part of an effort to hide its actual financial status. On Tuesday, a federal judge will decide if she goes to prison and how much time she'll spend behind bars, if any.  Breaking it down  Caroline Ellison ran Alameda Research under Sam Bankman-Fried, who was also briefly her romantic partner. Alongside other FTX executives, she was arrested shortly after the company's collapse, and pled guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges in December 2022.  Bankman-Fried, who was convicted on identical charges late last year, was sentenced to 25 years in prison after the government's probation office recommended over 100 years based on sentencing guidelines. Ellison's pre-sentence investigation report recommended three years of probation and time served – meaning no prison time – her attorneys said earlier this month.  Ellison's attorneys also argued that she shouldn't spend any time in prison, citing her cooperation with the Department of Justice – including her testimony against Bankman-Fried – and her work to help creditors and FTX's bankruptcy estate recover funds. As part of their sentencing memorandum, Ellison's attorneys included letters from John J. Ray III, the current CEO of FTX and attorneys for FTX's creditors (alongside the usual selection of supportive notes from friends and family).  The DOJ did not provide a specific sentencing recommendation, unlike with Bankman-Fried (who prosecutors said should spend 40 or 50 years behind bars, below the probation office's 100-year recommendation). Instead, prosecutors said they would make a motion under Section 5K1.1 of the sentencing guidelines, which means they recommend a sentence below the guidelines calculation.  ""What is particularly unusual about the speed of Ellison’s cooperation is how many times she met with the Government in a short span of time, and how quickly she pleaded guilty to the full slate of misconduct related to her participation in a complex financial fraud,"" the DOJ filing said. ""That required numerous lengthy meetings with the Government in short succession, as well as a mindset that she was prepared to be fully candid with the Government from the outset of her cooperation, and accept complete responsibility for her crimes without minimization or evasion.""  The remaining wild card is Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw last year's trial and was a firsthand witness to Ellison's testimony.  Kaplan sentenced Ryan Salame, the former CEO of FTX Digital Markets, to more than seven years in prison earlier this year. Like Ellison, Salame pled guilty to criminal charges, but unlike her, he did not testify or provide the same cooperation. He also faced different charges, but his sentence suggests the extreme upper bound for Ellison, if she does go to prison, will be a few years.  Following Ellison, former FTX executives Nishad Singh and Gary Wang are the remaining two executives who will be sentenced. Ellison's sentence will likely be a strong signal for how much time they may actually face, given the similar circumstances for all three individuals.

U.S. Election Betting: CFTC, Kalshi Both Grilled by Judges in Appeals Court: Attorneys for both Kalshi and the CFTC argued in front of an appeals court, which frankly seemed unimpressed by either party.  Telegram to Provide More User Data to Governments After CEO’s Arrest: Telegram will now be more cooperative with law enforcement entities after CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France last month, Durov said in a post on the messaging platform.  Coinbase v. SEC  A few years ago, Coinbase filed a petition to try and force the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to engage in rulemaking around digital assets. The regulator pushed back, saying no bespoke rulemaking was necessary at the time.  On Monday, a federal appeals court heard arguments from both the SEC and Coinbase in this ongoing effort. Eugene Scalia, a partner with Gibson Dunn, argued that the appeals court should compel the SEC to explain how they define digital assets (or transactions with digital assets) as securities and explain how those rules might be workable.  ""The SEC, having made registration a priority itself, needs to address immediately the fact that registration is not possible,"" Scalia said.  Ezekiel Hill, an SEC attorney, pushed back, saying that Coinbase's filing before the court doesn't rise to the ""rare circumstances"" that would allow the court to force the regulatory agency to conduct a rulemaking process.  Hill argued that the SEC wasn't obligated to create a specific framework for cryptocurrencies, and there are already companies that comply with federal securities laws. For crypto, the SEC has looked to the Howey Test, he said.  ""The securities framework is not premised on compliance being possible,"" Hill said. ""It balances a number of interests, including investor protection, fair and efficient markets, capital formation, and not everybody who comes and wants to participate in a securities marketplace is able to do what they want to do. That's not a unique issue to digital asset securities.""  The judges grilled Hill more than Scalia over the course of the hearing, but it's unclear how they might rule.  One interesting note: Hill repeatedly referred to ""digital asset securities"" – a term the SEC told a D.C. judge it would stop using a few weeks ago – though he did say later in the hearing that ""the digital asset is not the security,"" but it ""can be the subject of an investment contract.""  This week  Monday  19:00 UTC (3:00 p.m. EDT) The Third Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from Coinbase and the U.S. SEC over Coinbase's petition to force rulemaking.  Tuesday  14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. EDT) The five SEC commissioners will testify before the House Financial Services Committee.  19:00 UTC (3:00 p.m. EDT) Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison will be sentenced.  Wednesday  14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. EDT) SEC Chair Gary Gensler was supposed to testify before the Senate Banking Committee, but this hearing was postponed early Tuesday.

33941734,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644206,1727197249,XRP Remains Bullish: Crypto Experts Unveil Predictions For The Price,"Crypto experts have unveiled their bullish XRP price predictions despite the crypto’s stagnant price action. One factor that could contribute to this projected rally is the SEC Ripple appeal deadline which is fast approaching. If there is no appeal, it will ultimately end the long-running lawsuit which has bordered on XRP. Crypto Experts Reveal Their Predictions For XRP Expert Crypto Bitlord mentioned in an X post that he believes XRP is ready and that he expects a “parabolic explosion” to the upside within 24 hours. He advised market participants not to sleep on XRP as millions can be made by timing this move. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) To Come back From The Dead As Ascending Triangle Appears Crypto analyst Jackis also provided a bullish prediction for XRP. He shared an inverted chart in an X post while stating that the breakdown will be violent, although alluding to an imminent breakout. The chart showed that XRP could finally reach $1 when this projected breakout occurs. Crypto analyst Dark Defender is also confident that XRP can reach $1 soon enough. He stated that XRP is ready to tear the last weekly Ichimoku Clouds which is at $0.6649. He predicts that the imminent move to the upside will also eliminate the January 2018 resistance which is above $1.03. Mikybull Crypto is another expert that is bullish on XRP. He recently noted that a similar move from 2017 might happen for the crypto in this cycle. He remarked that history doesn’t always repeat itself but often rhymes. 2017 was the year when XRP enjoyed its historic 61,000% price surge in 280 days. In another X post, Mikybull Crypto claimed that XRP has one of the most bullish macro charts out there. The accompanying chart he shared showed that the altcoin could, at some point, reach $45, although that looks unlikely to happen in this market cycle. However, crypto analysts like Egrag Crypto have predicted that XRP’s price can reach double digits in this bull run. Bullish Pennant On The Chart In an X post, crypto analyst Armando Pantoja highlighted a 7-year bullish pennant on XRP’s chart. He stated that he had never seen anything like this in all his years of trading. In line with this, he claimed that market participants are about to witness one of the “biggest breakouts” of the year. Related Reading: Fed Rate Cuts Spurs $1.6 Billion Bitcoin Buying Spree Among Whales, Can BTC Reach $70,000? He believes that the breakout should be parabolic considering that XRP’s price has consolidated for these seven years. He remarked that the charts rarely lie and that this setup is too perfect. His accompanying chart showed that the crypto can rise to $4 when this breakout finally happens. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.58, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42417184,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTQasv,1727193077,'We are Running Out of Time': U.S. House Democrat Urges Stablecoin Bill Compromise,"A key Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee used a hearing on Tuesday as a chance to push for an 11th-hour compromise on stablecoin legislation.  The hearing also saw Republican members hammering Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler on his crypto oversight record and the agency's reliance on enforcement actions to steer the industry.  U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the House Financial Services Committee's ranking Democrat, suggested in a Securities and Exchange Commission oversight hearing on Tuesday that she and the Republican chairman should finish a bill this year to regulate U.S. stablecoin issuers.  ""I want us to strike a grand bargain on stablecoins and other long overdue bills,"" Waters said to the committee's chairman, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.). ""I strongly believe we can reach a deal that prioritizes strong protections for our nation's consumers and strong federal oversight.""  McHenry, who is set to retire at the end of the year, responded that it's his hope ""that we can come to terms on stablecoin legislation this Congress,"" though he noted, ""the nature of how we do that is where things get a little tougher and the votes are a little tougher.""  ""We're running out of time to pass this,"" Waters said. She and McHenry had previously worked for months on a compromise bill on stablecoin regulation, but a bipartisan effort hasn't yet crossed the finish line. With the congressional session waning, the opportunity to shepherd legislation is dwindling.  The SEC hearing – unusual in its inclusion of all five commissioners testifying at once – quickly became a crypto debate as McHenry and others criticized the agency's ""reckless agenda"" regarding the industry. Republicans specifically targeted Chair Gary Gensler's track record.  ""Under Chair Gensler, the SEC has become a rogue agency,"" McHenry said. He lamented aggressive SEC crypto enforcement even as the House approved a widely bipartisan bill, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), that showed that most of Congress disagreed with the agency's approach to digital assets.  When questioned about the regulator using inconsistent phrases when addressing what makes a crypto security under SEC jurisdiction, Gensler responded that ""it's less about the terms; it's more about the economics.""  ""Words have meaning,"" McHenry responded, arguing the agency is causing ""a lack of clarity.""  Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce said that's been a deliberate choice, against her will.  ""We're trying to be ambiguous, because the legal precision carries with it real implications,"" she said, and the intentional murkiness has left uncertainty about how the agency is defining what qualifies a token transaction as a security. ""We've fallen down on our duty as a regulator.""  Earlier this week, Republican lawmakers also demanded in a letter that the agency throw out its crypto accounting policy approach, known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). The policy has left U.S. banks uncertain about taking custody of crypto assets because the policy suggests they'd need to maintain unusual levels of capital.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/24/we-are-running-out-of-time-us-house-democrat-urges-stablecoin-bill-compromise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0174258edd41b85b3a4ad4f1bdcd647241cf40ac-1659x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417194,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTQb4H,1727192246,MicroStrategy Outpaces BlackRock's IBIT by Over 3x Year-to-Date,"Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  As an ETF, BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust incurs an expense ratio of 0.25%, while MicroStrategy charges no such fee to shareholders.  MicroStrategy benefits from revenue generated by its analytics business, providing financial stability beyond its bitcoin holdings.  MSTR has the ability to raise capital via debt and equity offerings, while IBIT is reliant on direct investor inflows.  Disclosure: The writer owns shares in MicroStrategy.  The launch of U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds on Jan. 11, 2024, has become one of the year's most significant financial events. These ETFs, including the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), have collectively attracted $17.7 billion in net inflows since their debut, according to Farside data. IBIT, to some, has emerged as a competitor to MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company renowned for its substantial bitcoin holdings and dual business model. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy currently holds 252,220 bitcoins, valued at approximately $16 billion. Year-to-date, MicroStrategy's stock has risen 119% compared to IBIT's 35%, reflecting a more than threefold outperformance.  Profit-taking  From the opening of the ETFs until around Feb. 23, IBIT outperformed MicroStrategy as investors either shifted capital to the new funds or took profits on what had been a large run higher in MSTR's stock in the weeks prior to Jan. 11.  This trend of profit-taking spread to bitcoin as well, as long-term holders (those holding bitcoin for 155 days or more) sold approximately one million bitcoin from December 2023 through the first quarter of 2024, according to Glassnode data.  MSTR versus IBIT  There are several key reasons for MicroStrategy's impressive returns and its ability to outperform IBIT. One of the first factors is fees. ETFs come with an expense ratio—currently 0.25% for IBIT—which acts as a drag on returns. In contrast, MicroStrategy does not charge such a fee to shareholders, making it more attractive over time in terms of cost efficiency.  Furthermore, MicroStrategy operates as a business that generates revenue beyond its bitcoin thesis, primarily through its analytics operations. This diversification allows the company to produce free cash flow and could provide some cushioning during bitcoin's drawdowns even as the stock outperforms during the token's rallies. Since bitcoin's all-time high in March, bitcoin has decreased by 13% and IBIT is down 14%, while MicroStrategy has declined by 15%.  Additionally, MicroStrategy has the flexibility to increase its bitcoin per share through debt or equity offerings. For example, it recently upsized a convertible note offering from $700 million to $1.01 billion, using the proceeds to acquire more bitcoin—something IBIT cannot do directly, unless it sees more inflows from investors.  Mark Palmer, Senior Research Analyst at Benchmark, said MicroStrategy's recent financial strategies, such as issuing convertible bonds and retiring high-interest debt, have improved its financial flexibility and made the stock more efficient access to capital markets compared to other bitcoin-buying stocks.  ""A strong case could be made that MSTR following the convert issuance and senior notes retirement had more flexibility to access the capital markets than it had prior to it given its lighter interest burden and increased holdings of unencumbered bitcoins,"" said Palmer, who has a buy rating on the stock and price target of $215.  Marketing  In terms of marketing and visibility, MicroStrategy has also maintained a higher ranking in Google search trend than IBIT, signaling better recognition and interest. This gap has, however narrowed of late, as options trading on IBIT have now been approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC).

He claims the coin is “ripe” for a parabolic action that might make investors quite profitable. Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Explodes By 81% – Is $530 The Next Target? XRP might see a significant price ascent, even if it lags behind other leading cryptocurrencies in recent increases. With a bullish XRP price prediction of 113% increase over the next year, CoinCheckup further fuels the increasing optimism on the token. XRP rose just 3% last week; in comparison major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana jumped by more than 10%. XRP was down 1% in the last 24 hours, while its competitors showed 2% increase. Still, Bitlord thinks the altcoin is set to explode in the next 24 hours. His reasoning isn’t entirely clear, but his history of making accurate predictions is enough for many traders to watch the token closely. I think $XRP is ready -Expecting a parabolic explosion vertically within 24hrs. Don’t sleep, millions can be made timing this move 🚀 — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) September 22, 2024 Trading Momentum And Patterns Not only is Bitlord staring at XRP for a possible breakout. The Moon, another trader, has noted a symmetrical triangle pattern developing on the weekly chart of XRP. Often indicating a period of consolidation before a major change, this technical arrangement shows converging support and resistance lines. According to the trader’s study, XRP might explode by an amazing 221% should it break above the upper resistance line, hence perhaps guiding the price above $1.34. 💥#XRP may explode in this bull cycle! If it breaks out of this massive triangle, it could go parabolic! pic.twitter.com/wG2SeexCca — The Moon (@TheMoonCarl) September 21, 2024 Apart from these increases, XRP’s price movement over the past week shows encouraging signals. The coin showed a noteworthy peak for the month, touching $0.61 before declining to $0.5796. Given the traders’ ongoing interest in the asset, this surge might suggest more notable upward moves. XRP: Short-Term Gains Or Long-Term Play? Although some traders remain optimistic despite XRP’s slow performance in recent months casting questions on its capacity to maintain pace with rivals. Bitlord’s insistence on a parabolic action has some validity. Going from $0.43 to $0.6366, he counseled investors back in July to purchase XRP before it jumped by 48% within a week. Those who took his advice profited handsomely, and many are hoping for a repeat performance. Technical data from CoinCheckup only go to reinforce hope. Based on their prediction, XRP will surge 19% in the next month and 16% in the following three months. Their predicted growth of 138% in the next six months may indicate an excellent bull run.

BTC's technical indicators show potential bullish signs if it can maintain above the 20-week moving average. Capital flows into BTC are strong, making up 94% of total crypto capital flow in 2024, indicating market preference. Seasonality favors BTC in October, historically its best month, but caution is advised as past performance isn't indicative of future returns. Back in early-May, I initiated coverage of the ProShares Ultra Bitcoin ETF ( BITU ) with a ""sell"" rating. Like most other 2x ETFs that I've covered, my primary reason for calling BITU a sell was due to the long term decay of leveraged ETFs like BITU. In this update, we'll look at some of my takeaways from Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) chart, capital flow, and any signals we can pull from history to help form our view on BTC today. Risks Right Out of The Gate I won't rehash the entire risks section from my previous article. 2x ETFs are riskier than standard ETFs because they are rebalanced daily to meet their 2x goal. In theory, if Bitcoin's price improves by 2% in a single session, BITU should increase by 4%. The same is true when Bitcoin declines. However, chop will erode the fund overtime. Thus, BITU buyers will benefit more when BTC is in a sustained uptrend rather than enduring several months of sideways like we've experienced the last six months or so. Data by YCharts The chart above shows the performance of BITU against both BTC and the index since my first article covering the ETF. Not only are Bitcoin and BITU both well behind the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) over the last few months, but BITU is already behind Bitcoin even though it's designed to double daily BTC returns. I think this makes the point quite clearly that BITU is not recommended for long term holding. But that doesn't mean there isn't a time and a place for BITU positions if the right set up is present. Technical Picture In May, I highlighted how BTC likely had a date with key moving averages. Today, we find the coin in a far different situation than it was 4 1/2 months ago. BTC Daily Chart (TrendSpider) The first thing I want to point out is the coin did indeed test the 200 day moving average following my May article. The bad news for bulls is that line has since flipped from support to resistance. Additionally, the 50 and 100 day MAs both crossed below the 200 back in August the trend in those MAs is clearly down. The 200 MA trend has also been signaling a trend turn over the last week or so. But as I'm reading it, bulls are indeed trying to take control back: BTC Weekly Chart (TrendSpider) Two of the MAs I've been focused on with Bitcoin for some time are the 8 week and 20 week moving averages. BTC is currently ahead of the 20 week MA though it remains to be seen if it can hold more than one or two consecutive weekly closes above that line. We're on week 2 at the moment. We've seen a few attempts at regaining that MA fail in recent months. But in my view, if BTC can flip the 20 week to support rather than resistance, it'd be a very positive sign and a potential indication that BTC is ready for the next leg up. Capital Flow Story US ETF Supply (Author's Table, BitcoinTreasuries.net) As it is for all asset classes, capital flows have proven to be important for Bitcoin. Particularly since the approval of spot ETFs in the United States earlier this year. Those funds have seen about 255k BTC of positive net flow come into the traditional financial system via the ETF wrapper even adjusting for the Grayscale 'fee flight.' Crypto Flows By Asset (CoinShares) While the month to date flow story has been a bit back and forth in September, Bitcoin's YTD capital investment flow of $21 billion in 2024 is responsible for 94% of the total crypto capital flow this year. Furthermore, BTC makes up 82% of the total AUM in the crypto investment product industry. It seems clear the market likes BTC far more than anything else in the cryptocurrency industry. Seasonality & Additional Considerations I've pointed it out in a handful of other articles as well but it bears repeating here; seasonality for Bitcoin is positive as we head into October. Going back the last decade, October has the highest positive return rate of any month as the coin generates full month positive returns in 80% of the Octobers since 2014. BTC Seasonality (TrendSpider) But beyond that, the mean change in the month is 19.1%. This is the highest mean change of any month during the year for BTC. The point is, if history is any guide, October should be a good month for Bitcoin. Now, it's important to caveat this with the old adage: past performance is not indicative of future returns. Look no further than September 2024 for an instance of Bitcoin bucking it's historical trend. September is not historically one of Bitcoin's better months, its actually typically one of the con's worth months. And yet, BTC is currently up over 7% this month and 2024 is on pace to produce the second best September for BTC going back the last 10 years. Point is, history is a useful tool but it doesn't mean we have any degree of certainty as to what the coin will do. 30 Day Pearson (TheBlock) Finally, the chart above shows the 30 day correlation between BTC, the Nasdaq, the S&P 500, and Gold. Not only are we seeing a tightening of these correlations, but they're all headed higher - indicating a higher positive correlation between the assets. In light of the Federal Reserve recently cutting Fed Funds by 50 basis points, the market seems to be preparing for a return to easing and asset price inflation. Final Takeaways BTC vs Fear & Greed (TrendSpider) I'm upgrading BITU from 'sell' to 'hold' because I'm getting the feeling the market wants to go higher. Crypto fear and greed has been steadily rising for weeks, BTC's failed tests of 200 day MA aren't resulting in a rapid price decline as we saw in August. Rather, BTC seems to be knocking on the door. The weekly chart gives some reason for cautious optimism with a coin now ahead of the 20 week MA. Though choppy lately, capital flows have been positive all year, seasonality looks terrific, and all markets seem to be rising together in a long term bet against the dollar. Of course, if you like the setup in BTC, you can just buy BTC. Despite the upgrade, I still won't recommend holding BITU for longer than a few weeks, at most.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4722963-bitu-knocking-on-the-door?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33939751.jpeg

33937995,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644237,1727186409,"BNB Falters At $600, Paving The Way For A Deeper Pullback","BNB bullish rally has hit a wall as the $600 resistance level proves to be a formidable barrier. After an impressive upward run, momentum has stalled, and downside pressure is starting to build. While bulls are struggling to regain control, the bears are gaining confidence, signaling a potential shift in market direction. With the rally halted and key support levels under threat, BNB is now facing an increased risk of a pullback, leaving traders on edge as the price hovers at this crucial threshold. As BNB faces the formidable $600 resistance, the aim is to analyze the mounting pressure that has halted its recent rally. We will explore the technical indicators that signal a potential downturn, market sentiment, and potential price movements as the bulls fight to regain control. Risk Assessment: Evaluating The Downside Potential Despite BNB’s price trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, which typically signals a positive trend, the cryptocurrency has faced significant resistance at the $600 mark. This resistance has resulted in a noticeable pullback, indicating that upward momentum falters as sellers capitalize on the current price level. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a potential price drop as the RSI line is dropping from the overbought zone toward the 50% threshold, reflecting rising bearish pressure for the cryptocurrency that might push the price toward $537. Related Reading: BNB Price Surge Eyes $550 Breakout: Can It Push Higher? Also, on the daily chart, BNB is currently showing bearish momentum as it drops toward the $537 mark. Since breaking above the 100-day SMA, the price has experienced a consistent upward trend without any significant pullbacks, indicating that a huge correction may be on the horizon. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a comprehensive analysis of the RSI signal line reveals a recent decline to 68% after peaking at 72%. This movement suggests a shift in momentum, signaling that BNB is entering a consolidation phase or facing increased selling pressure, which could lead to additional price corrections. Future Outlook: What Lies Ahead for BNB? Although the cryptocurrency has demonstrated resilience by maintaining its position above key moving averages, the increasing bearish pressure and recent pullbacks indicate that BNB’s price could decline toward the $537 support level. If it reaches this point and manages to break below, this could trigger a further drop toward other support levels, heightening concerns among traders about the potential for extended downward momentum. Related Reading: BNB Weekly Active Addresses Surge Over 6% – Is A Rally On The Way? Alternatively, if the bulls can stage a recovery before BNB reaches the $537 support level, the price could begin to rise again toward the $600 resistance. A breakout above this key level may open the door for more gains, with BNB likely testing higher resistance points as bullish momentum builds.

Clementine harnesses BitVM, a computing paradigm designed to allow Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin and which could also pave the way for zero-knowledge computations.  Bitcoin zero-knowledge rollup Citrea has deployed its BitVM-based bridge Clementine to the Bitcoin testnet.  Citrea, which raised $2.7 million in seed funding led by Galaxy in February, aims to use Bitcoin as a settlement layer to make it ""the foundation for the world's finance,"" according to an emailed announcement on Tuesday.  In a blog post in March, the Citrea team described Clementine as a ""trust-minimized two-way peg program,"" essentially a way of locking up bitcoin on the main chain and then minting an equivalent bitcoin token for use on Citrea; to reverse the process, that token is burned and the bitcoin can then be withdrawn on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Clementine harnesses BitVM, a computing paradigm introduced last year by the Bitcoin developer Robin Linus, ultimately designed to allow Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin, and which could also pave the way for zero-knowledge computations.  Citrea is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the smart-contracts-executing software that powers the Ethereum protocol, similar to an operating system on a computer.  ""Citrea is an EVM-compatible layer, meaning all the applications on Ethereum can simply deploy on Citrea without having to change anything,"" Orkun Mahir Kılıç, CEO of Citrea builder Chainway Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview.  BitVM is a conduit that can connect rollups to the Bitcoin network, allowing transactions to be settled away from the main blockchain to mitigate congestion and fees. The basic setup of BitVM involves using cryptography to compress programs into sub-programs that can then be executed within Bitcoin transactions, according to a white paper published by Linus along with five co-authors.

42417185,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTQaw1,1727186400,DeFi Protocol Cega Debuts 'Vault Token Market' to Facilitate Seamless Investing,"Cega's vault token market (VTM) eliminates the protocol's 27-day lock-up period, allowing users to withdraw their vault token deposits when required.  The new feature is available to market makers and yield farmers.  On Tuesday, decentralized exotic-derivatives protocol Cega announced a new feature that gives users more flexibility in managing their investments and responding to changing market conditions.  The Vault Token Market (VTM) will boost liquidity, utility and flexibility of users' investments, Cega said in a press release shared with CoinDesk.  With a total value locked (TVL) of over $10 million, Cega is the world's third-largest decentralized exotic-derivatives protocol. It allows holders of dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC to earn yields while bypassing the need for active management of positions. Users deposit USDC or other assets like ether {{ETH}} and wstETH into the vaults, which then employ strategies centered around packaged exotic derivatives such as fixed-coupon notes and put spreads to generate attractive returns. Vault participants receive Cega vault tokens representing their financial position in the strategy.  Each vault runs the strategy for 27 days, beginning every Wednesday at 1:00 UTC, simplifying the investment process. For issuers, however, that means their USDC is locked into the vault for 27 days, keeping them from accessing their funds. The liquidity barrier limits users' ability to react to changing market conditions and meet financial needs.  The VTM addresses this issue, allowing users an early exit.  ""With the VTM, users can exit from their trading positions early, without waiting for 27 days. They can exit 100% of their position, or half, or any amount they choose, providing maximum flexibility,"" Cega's co-founder Winston Zhang said in an interview.  VTM is open to everyone, including market makers and yield farmers, allowing market participants to buy and sell the Cega vault tokens in the open market. VTM's benchmark price feature ensures fair value for vault tokens and the best execution when selling them or looking to snap up coins at discounted positions.  ""VTM opens the door to a wide range of strategic use cases, from liquid staking and restaking to collateralized lending/borrowing. Off-ramping is just the first step in creating robust ecosystem opportunities for Cega vault tokens,"" the press release said.  14:21 UTC: Updates third para to say users can deposits USDC and other assets like ETH and wstETH to vaults.",POSITIVE,ETH | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED | USDC,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/24/defi-protocol-cega-debuts-vault-token-market-to-facilitate-seamless-investing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc3ebbce3db318773174c965c65a6c725fd25871-3456x2304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417178,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTQaon,1727185937,How Democrats Have Shifted on Crypto,"There’s nothing quite like a political convention. The pageantry of patriotic songs and speeches. The cavalcade of speeches by party leaders. And, of course, the thousands of balloons dropping like snow on the newly nominated presidential candidate.  Yet, for crypto, August’s Democratic National Convention was an especially auspicious one. Despite the open hostility of parts of the Biden Administration, crypto was for the first time a welcomed participant. It makes sense: crypto owners now comprise about 20 percent of all registered Democratic voters, according to a Paradigm poll of Democratic voters a few days before the convention. There is severe electoral risk if some of these Democrats deflect to the Republican ticket in a race that could be won in the margins. Considering that the Republicans have openly and aggressively courted crypto, crypto’s coming out at the DNC signaled that the industry was, finally, beginning to have a truly bipartisan hue. Those on the ground in Chicago got to see this blossoming of Democratic interest first hand.  While most of the crypto-focused conversations were offstage, there was a hint of crypto’s growing importance in the main convention hall too. Young pro-crypto members of Congress and candidates for Congress like Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D.-TX) and congressional candidate Shomari Figures of Alabama both received significant speaking slots. Some crypto companies also hosted policymakers for discussions off the convention floor, as other companies and organizations have done for decades. Vice President Harris herself stressed the importance of building an “Opportunity Economy” in her keynote, with a special grace note praising the role of Founders in making America prosperous.  This was just the proverbial tip of the political iceberg, though. It’s easy to forget when you’re watching convention programming during primetime, but political conventions are much more than a few hours of short speeches and slick videos. Conventions are, at base, about letting members of a political party agglomerate in one physical space every few years, both for socialization and for strategizing.  As part of this communal process, the week was filled with panels, meetings, and even press interviews, all of which are designed to help the party build consensus on its policy views, goals, and even beliefs. These are the interstitial material that truly comprises our decentralized political parties. And it’s here that crypto really got to make its voice heard.  Over the week, there were panels on the basics of how crypto works and how Democrats can work to rectify the party’s strained relationship with crypto. There were discussions about the importance of maintaining the hegemony of the dollar and the role of stablecoins. And there were frequent coffee and water cooler discussions with dozens of policymakers about how they can appeal to crypto owners.  During chats that week with a host of different policymakers and opinion leaders, we were most struck not by the statements of crypto supportive policymakers, but the skeptics. Even some ardent crypto skeptics said the current enforcement-only approach at the SEC wasn’t working, and that there was a need for legislation. As two people who have been calling for reasonable legislation for years, this was music to our ears.  The other part that was especially notable was just how normal it was. Policymakers were curious about crypto, both how it worked and its involvement in this year’s elections. But this curiosity was not hedged with the upturned nose that accompanied some discussions about crypto in DC even last year. Instead, we were seen as just another young and novel industry, one that policymakers were trying to grok.  The Harris campaign underscored this banal normality when it made news of its “support” for crypto’s growth in a press interview with the campaign’s policy director, Brian Nelson. Despite some anxiety about Nelson’s view of crypto given his recent role as Undersecretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Nelson announced on the third day of the DNC that a Harris Administration would “support” the growth of crypto in America. The statement was remarkable given how much a political war has been waged on crypto, and unremarkable for how basic it was. Why wouldn’t an American president want an industry to stay headquartered in America?  The Harris campaign has since released its platform, which has emphasis on entrepreneurs, small businesses, and American innovators. While crypto and other technologies are not mentioned by name, the rhetoric and tone used in the platform differs significantly from that of the Biden administration. Since the DNC, both of us have continued to meet with policymakers and candidates from across the political spectrum, and what is remarkable is how similar most conversations are, whether with Democrats or Republicans down the ballot.  Policymakers are tired of (and in some cases, shocked by) the SEC’s approach under Chair Gensler. They want to preserve and promote American national security and economic interests. And, by and large, they are deeply concerned about inadvertently ceding technological advantages to other jurisdictions, as happened with semiconductors.  More than anything else, an overarching feeling of simple acceptance for crypto pervaded Chicago. There are still many miles to go for the Democrats to actually find workable solutions for how they want to regulate crypto, but the first step to building something is to commit to doing it. We were pleased to see Vice President Harris acknowledge recently that digital assets technologies need to be encouraged; while we may not have a schematic for how Democrats will execute a reset with crypto, both the DNC and recent Crypto4Harris event showed that Democrats across the ticket no longer question as a default whether crypto has a right to exist. That’s progress worth celebrating with a balloon drop.

There has been notable activity from Bitcoin wallets dating back to the Satoshi era in the past year, including a wallet that moved $16 million worth of BTC after 15 years of dormancy.  An early bitcoin {{BTC}} whale who mined the asset in its infancy in 2009 has transferred a portion of its holdings to crypto exchange Kraken after a decade of dormancy, data from on-chain tool Arkham shows.  The whale, a colloquial term for entities holding a large amount of bitcoin, holds bitcoin mined just one month after the network first went live. It sent 5 BTC to Kraken earlier Tuesday, worth just over $300,000 at current prices.  Arkham said the whale moved bitcoin several times from 2011 to 2014 to other wallets or exchanges, after which there was no activity on the wallet for nearly ten years. Its bitcoin holdings increased in value from $474,000 to over $80 million in that period.  The wallet first started moving bitcoin to Kraken three weeks ago and has moved 10 BTC so far in three separate transactions. Moving a high value of tokens to an exchange is typically seen as an indication of selling for cash, stablecoins or other tokens.  Late last week, another “Satoshi Era” bitcoin wallet showed activity for the first time in 15 years, sending $16 million worth of BTC to several different wallets.  Satoshi era refers commonly to the period when bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was active on online forums from late 2009 to 2011.  Several ""Satoshi era"" bitcoin have been active in the past few years. In July 2023, a wallet dormant for 11 years transferred $30 million worth of the asset to other wallets, while in August, another wallet transferred 1,005 BTC to a new address. Then, in December last year, over 1,000 BTC were sent to crypto exchanges - where they were likely sold off - marking one of the largest amounts from the Satoshi era moved to exchanges.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ARKM,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/24/bitcoin-miner-from-networks-earliest-months-is-sending-btc-to-kraken,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b5686ecbc02372f344a8692053ee3d3926c02fe-1420x799.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Not only does the analyst expect an eventual break above the coveted $1 level, they push further, expect Dogecon to put on a parabolic rally that could shock the crypto market. This could catapult the DOGE cryptocurrency forward, and put on a performance that could be reminiscent of its 2021 price surge. Dogecoin Completes Accumulation Phase In an analysis posted on the TradingView website, pseudonymous crypto analyst TradingShot has given a bullish forecast for the Dogecoin price. First, the analyst points back to a previous analysis first shared around a year ago. This analysis had predicted that the DOGE price would enter an accumulation phase before the surge. Related Reading: Diamond Hand Ethereum Whale Moves 15,000 ETH, Here’s The Destination Fast forward to the present, the crypto analyst explains that Dogecoin did, in fact, enter this accumulation phase and completed it as predicted. This brings the crypto analyst to the next phase of the forecast, which is the price surge from here. As TradingShot explains, this accumulation phase was present in previous bullish cycle, making it an important fixture here. Furthermore, a bullish cross at the 1-Week 50 and 00-Moving Averages, as well as the 1-Week 100-Moving Average holding steady after coming to a Channel Down/Bull Flag, leads it into its Parabolic Rally phase, which is where the fun begins. Price Targets For DOGE’s Parabolic Rally With the Dogecoin price now entering the parabolic rally phase of the forecast, the crypto analyst has presented the possible levels that the DOGE price could reach. For the most conservative lives, the crypto analyst predicts that a rise to $2 is possible. TradingShot refers to this 1,760% rally from the current level as the “proper target” for this cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 8,500% Rally For Cardano To Reach $31 As Indicators Turn Bullish However, just like with any parabolic rally, there is the possibility that the price will continue to rise even after reaching its realistic target. In what the analyst calls an “overextension case,” they explain that the price could rise 5,500% to reach as high as $6.

To comply with Nasdaq's $1 minimum listing requirement, BKKT executed a 1-for-25 reverse stock split in April. Dilution over the last 1 year at just under 70% and free cash burn of $66 million in the recent quarter highlight the liquidity headwind facing the company. Bakkt Holdings Overview Bakkt Holdings ( BKKT ) has dropped 83% year-to-date on the back of its net losses and cash burn. I flagged this conundrum when I last covered the crypto custody, trading, and rewards firm in 2022. BKKT's performance since would see the firm engineer a 1-for-25 reverse stock split in April to comply with the NYSE's $1 minimum listing requirement. The question now is whether BKKT forms a buy against a materially lower market cap than when it went public via a special purpose acquisition company at a $2.1 billion enterprise value. BKKT's market cap currently stands at $130 million. Data by YCharts The company recorded second-quarter total revenue of $509.9 million , up 46.7% over its year-ago comp, with full-year 2024 revenue expected to be between $2.57 billion to $2.83 billion. However, the bulk of this revenue is generated by BKKT's extremely low-margin crypto services segment, which deals with custody and trading. This segment also drove the year-over-year revenue growth as crypto emerged from its long winter and trading volume and volatility picked up materially. Bakkt Holdings Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Form 10-Q Subsequent crypto costs at $491.7 million during the second quarter place the operating gross profit of the segment at $18.2 million, a 3.56% gross margin. Hence, BKKT reports an adjusted revenue figure that's essentially net of this segment. This was $14.8 million during the second quarter, up roughly 9% year-over-year but down 13% from the first quarter. This raises the question of the utility of the custody and trading segment to shareholders from a value creation perspective. It's been nearly entirely discounted by the stock market, and the company uses the adjusted figures in its earnings call and presentation . Bakkt Holdings Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Presentation Losses, Negative Cash Flow, And Potential Sale BKKT's net loss during the second quarter at $35.5 million was an improvement from a loss of $50.5 million a year ago. However, the year-ago period had acquisition-related expenses of $17 million, albeit countered by a $15 million loss in the recent second quarter from a change in the fair value of warrant liability. The core headwind faced by BKKT stems from its negative free cash flow profile and dwindling liquidity base. However, bulls would flag that the company has no real debt on its balance sheet with most of its liabilities driven by its operations, with safeguarding obligations for crypto and customer funds payable as the main constituents. Data by YCharts Free cash flow during the second quarter was negative at $66.36 million, a material deterioration from BKKT's year-ago comp and from the first quarter, when the company generated a positive free cash flow of $36.6 million. The company ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $60.67 million. There is another $34 million available from restricted cash. BKKT's liquidity has been on a sustained dip since the firm raised $448 million in gross proceeds following its business combination. The company's zero debt balance could potentially open the space for taking on some debt to buffer its short-term liquidity. Data by YCharts BKKT completed an offering of 34,917,532 shares back in March pre-reverse stock split for roughly 87 cents each. The Form 8-K for the purchase agreement with unnamed third-party investors also highlighted that each offered share included a warrant with an exercise price of $1.02 per share. The dilution against a stock price that had already dipped substantially versus its near-term trading range highlights BKKT's difficult position. The firm needs to raise more funds, but a smaller market cap versus sustained negative free cash flow makes this undertaking materially more dilutive. Data by YCharts The company's average diluted common shares outstanding is up just under 70% over the last 1 year. BKKT also issued a going concern warning on an amended Form 10-Q filed for its fiscal 2023 third quarter published earlier this year. Hence, the company is now weighing a range of strategic options, including a sale of certain business units or a breakup of the company. The timeline for this has not been defined, but with the underlying business making substantial quarterly losses and burning cash, shareholders should temper their expectations of the possible value to be fetched from a sale. The crypto operations would be the most obvious candidate for a sale, but the poor margins make a value at sale beyond what's currently being priced by BKKT's current market cap unlikely. BKKT would face a limited number of quarters of cash runway if its cash burn reflects the second quarter. However, I don't think BKKT is a short candidate, with poor options volume and the specter of a sale hanging over the bears as Fed rate cuts restore animal spirits to drive higher crypto trading volume.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4722908-bakkt-holdings-high-cash-burn-ramps-with-sale-unlikely-to-be-positive?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33936002.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,014.90 +1% Bitcoin (BTC): $63,558.29 +0.07% Ether (ETH): $2,642.62 -0.1% S&P 500: 5,718.57 +0.28% Gold: $2,632.34 +0.23% Nikkei 225: 37,940.59 +0.57%  Top Stories  Bitcoin is little changed in the past 24 hours after recovering from a dip to $62,750 during the Asian morning to hold above $63,500. Ether was similarly unmoved at $2,645. Other leading altcoins showed a bit more life, with SOL and DOGE higher by 1.8% and 1.2%, respectively. The crypto market at large has risen by 0.9%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. Muted activity following a rally is quite common in the cryptocurrency market, as traders take profits and prices consolidate at new footholds.  The People's Bank of China took steps to stimulate the economy, including cutting the reserve requirement ratio for mainland banks by 50 basis points. The move drew little response from crypto prices. Asian stocks, on the other hand, rallied, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbing 3.2% and the Shanghai Composite index adding 2.3%. ""Bitcoin's lack of response to this news, juxtaposed against rallying Chinese indices, highlights that its current beta appears more tightly linked to Fed policy and U.S. markets, as evidenced by near two-year high correlations with US stocks, particularly following last week's FOMC meeting,"" Rick Maeda, a Singapore-based research analyst at Presto Research, wrote to CoinDesk in a note.  Ether ETFs recorded their highest outflows since July on Monday, with over $79 million exiting the funds. The figures are the highest since July 29, when ETH ETHs recorded a cumulative $98 million, and the fourth-highest since they first went live on July 23. The outflows were almost entirely concentrated in Grayscale's ETHE, which lost $80 million. Bitwise's ETHW recorded around $1.3 million in inflows while all the others showed no activity either way. This suggests a distinct lack of institutional demand for ETH, especially as the world's second-largest cryptocurrency has enjoyed a rally of over 10% in the last week.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the ratio of copper's per pound market price to the per ounce price of gold.  The ratio has jumped 2.3% today, offering positive cues to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, in the wake of China's large stimulus announcement.  The ratio dropped sharply in July, signaling an impending risk aversion, which materialized in early August.

Q2 earnings showed mixed results: net revenue down 13.1% QoQ but up 108% YoY; transaction revenue fell, while subscription/service revenue grew. Base blockchain metrics are promising, with surging daily active users and transactions, but Base sequencer fees have declined, impacting revenue. Despite favorable October seasonality, COIN's valuation remains high; I maintain a ""hold"" rating, with a preference for spot ETFs to play the BTC thesis. Since my last Coinbase ( COIN ) article on Seeking Alpha from mid-July, we've seen the company's stock pullback by over 30%. And this performance comes even as the broader market has moved slightly higher: Data by YCharts Coinbase: All About That Base Coinbase: Priced For Perfection This will be my 10th Coinbase article since originally calling the stock a ""buy"" at $33.53 in January 2023. In each article since that piece, I've rated the company's stock a ""hold."" Regardless of my concerns about Coinbase's long-term business model, one of my bigger immediate issues with longing COIN stock back in July was the company's valuation. In this article, we'll assess some takeaways from Q2 earnings, look at seasonality and correlations, and jump into the latest network metrics from the company's Base blockchain. Q2 Earnings For the quarter ended June, Coinbase reported over $1.4 billion in total revenue. Net revenue was down 13.1% quarter over quarter but did experience a 108% increase over the prior year. Breaking the revenue down by segment, subscription and service revenue generated quarter-over-quarter growth of 17.2% while transaction revenue fell by 27.5% from Q1. That said, transaction revenue was the larger driver of year over year revenue growth at 139% versus 78.6% for subscription and service revenue. Q2 Revenue (Coinbase) Subscription and service revenue accounted for 43.4% of net revenue, which makes Q2 the largest quarter of sub/service revenue percent since Q3-23. This was largely driven by blockchain rewards revenue, which grew 41% from Q1 and now makes up 13.4% of net revenue for the company. At $664.8 million in the quarter, consumer transaction revenue is still a very important part of the company's overall business and equates to just under half of Coinbase's Q2 net revenue. Compared to Q1, Coinbase was less reliant on consumer transaction revenue for net revenue, but we're still seeing consumer transaction share of net revenue grow from 43.6% to 48.2% year over year. COIN Monthly Transacting Users (TheBlock) For the quarter, Coinbase averaged 8 million monthly transacting users. This was notably higher than the 7 million from Q1, but well below the Q4-21 peak of 11.4 million monthly transacting users. There are two ways to potentially look at that; on one hand, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is within striking distance of a new all-time high, which many expect to be a matter of months away. Given that, the lack of meaningful user growth over the last three years could be concerning. On the other hand, it could also be indicative of a lack of FOMO in the market despite Bitcoin's price currently positioned well ahead of $60k per coin. Another possible explanation for the lack of user growth is the users may have just changed how they're engaging with the company. For instance, Coinbase has prioritized on-chain activity that could mitigate declines in centralized exchange usage over time. Base Usage Q2 is the second quarter that Coinbase has broken out ""other transaction revenue"" which includes revenue from Base sequencer fees. The other category was down QoQ from $56.1 million to $52.5 million as of quarter ended June. Coinbase specifically mentioned lower Base fees as the driver of this revenue decline. There is a strong likelihood that we'll see this revenue segment head even lower in Q3, given what we've seen on chain through this point in September. Base: Fees vs DAUs (Token Terminal) Consider the monthly sequencer fees for Base reported by Token Terminal going back to April. Between April and June, Token Terminal tracked Base fees totaling $26.8 million. There is admittedly still a week remaining in September, but as of article submission, Q3 Base fee revenue is less than $7 million for the full quarter . This speaks to the unpredictability of on-chain usage. The good thing for Base is DAUs have been surging month after month. As of 9/22/24, September is averaging 1.2 million daily actives - nearly double the figure from September 2023. ETH L2 Transactions (Artemis) Daily transactions have generally been trending higher each month across the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) L2 landscape. Yet, the strongest growth story is Base, which processed 120.8 million transactions in August. This was up nearly 8x the 15.9 million transactions Base processed in August 2023 and was more than transactions processed by Optimism ( OP-USD ) and Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ) combined. Chain Stablecoins (DefiLlama) Looking at the stablecoin footprint for Base, at $3.6 billion in stablecoin supply, Base is quickly approaching Solana for the number 5 spot on the total stable supply rankings. This is impressive given the fact that Base is an ETH L2 and yet, it can hold up against L1s not just for stable supply, but also active users. I see a real opportunity for Base to grow share over other chains given Coinbase is a major crypto on-ramp and also has a financial relationship with the second largest USD stablecoin issuer in Circle. However, that's very speculative and beyond the scope of this article. Seasonality, Correlations, & Valuation When I last covered COIN in July, I noted favorable seasonality in July but a more mixed return in August. September has once again proven to be a poor month for COIN returns, but October is now right around the corner: COIN Seasonality (TrendSpider.com) With a 15.3% mean return in October, we are now entering what is historically one of the best months of the year for COIN. Of course, this is a very small sample size, as COIN was only listed a few years ago. But Bitcoin itself has a longer history and the seasonality story for BTC in October is also a favorable one for bulls with a 19.1% mean return going back to the last decade. From a correlations standpoint, BITO is a slightly stronger driver of COIN returns than the Nasdaq: COIN BITO SPY QQQ Coinbase Global Inc 1 0.61 0.54 0.58 ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) 0.61 1 0.44 0.45 SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( SPY ) 0.54 0.44 1 0.95 Invesco QQQ Trust ( QQQ ) 0.58 0.45 0.95 1 Source: PortfolioVisualizer.com, asset correlations for time period 01/01/2022 - 08/31/2024 based on daily returns While the 60-day rolling correlation between COIN and BITO has been somewhat volatile, the correlation has not gone negative at any point since the beginning of 2022. COIN-BITO Correlation (PortfolioVisualizer.com) Thus, I'd say it's fair to assume Coinbase stock will do well if Bitcoin is rallying to new highs over the next 3-12 months. That said, valuation is still high from where I sit. Data by YCharts At 7.4x forward sales, COIN's price to sales ratio has pulled back from summer highs, but it is still well ahead of the financial sector median of 2.9. The same is true for the company's forward PE, which trades at about a 135% premium to the sector. Closing Takeaways While COIN's relationship with BTC if fairly self-evident, there is a far more interesting story for Coinbase longer term, in my opinion. The company has an opportunity to change how people pay each other utilizing USDC on the Base blockchain if it can get UE right. For me, it's worth keeping an eye on how that stablecoin supply story continues to play out for Base. Base users and transactions are growing nicely.

33933836,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644166,1727175606,Analyst Warns Of Short Squeeze as Bitcoin Futures Market Heats Up,"The Bitcoin futures market is seeing a rise in leverage, which may signal an impending short squeeze that could lead to a bullish rally, according to a recent report by a CryptoQuant analyst, known as Percival. Percival insights shared earlier today on the QuickTake platform detailed the current state of Bitcoin leverage and the potential impact it could have on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Surge: Binance Buyers Take Charge As Coinbase Premium Falls Bitcoin Open Interest And Leverage Surge Amid Volatility According to Percival, the futures market consists of two major groups: institutional traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and retail or native cryptocurrency traders. Institutional traders typically hedge their positions and are less prone to liquidations, while retail traders often face higher liquidation risks, particularly during periods of increased market volatility. These dynamics are particularly relevant now, as leverage in the futures market has surged over the past two weeks. Percival noted that open Interest in Bitcoin futures has now grown by $6 billion, reaching a total of $28.3 billion, just shy of the all-time high of $31 billion recorded in July. This increase in leverage is tied to recent market movements, especially around the volatility caused by the recent US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions. Despite this uptick, institutional traders are seen to hold onto their positions confidently, anticipating further volatility but are less exposed to liquidation risks than retail traders. In addition, funding rates for Bitcoin Future contracts indicate that investors holding long positions currently receive around $2 million daily. This suggests that demand for long positions remains strong, as investors are willing to pay to maintain these positions. However, Percival cautions that while this is not an “overly excessive amount”, sudden price corrections could quickly wipe out those over-leveraged traders attempting to capitalize on these market movements. Short Liquidations Hint At Possible Short Squeeze A notable observation in the report was the significant increase in short liquidations. Percival explained that short liquidations have risen by approximately $493 million, which could be a precursor to a “short squeeze.” A short squeeze occurs when short positions are forced to close due to rising prices, which can cause further upward pressure on the asset’s price—in this case, Bitcoin’s. Percival speculated that this surge in short liquidations could rapidly recover Bitcoin’s price following any “sharp corrections.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Approaches $65,000: Is Now The Perfect Time To Buy? The liquidation of short positions would give the market the momentum needed for Bitcoin to bounce back and potentially trigger a more significant rally. While volatility is expected in the short term, the overall outlook appears to lean towards a bullish trend if this short squeeze scenario continues.

42417191,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTQb1B,1727172919,Bitcoin's Trading Range Extends Beyond 125 Days as September Shows Resilience,"Bitcoin defies the odds with a 22% surge from the month's low, challenging September's bearish reputation.  All eyes are on the $65,200 mark as bitcoin approaches a pivotal point in its trading channel.  A 10% price increment analysis reveals bitcoin's potential for unexpected, significant moves.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has shown remarkable resilience this September, a typically bearish month, surging 22% from its monthly low of about $52,500. All eyes are now on the critical $65,200 mark, with market participants watching closely to see if it can break out of the current downtrend. Since climbing to a record high back in March, the largest cryptocurrency has been trading in a prolonged downward channel, creating a sense of ennui for many investors.  To gain insights into bitcoin’s trading behavior, consider an analysis using a 10% price increment system. This provides a fairer comparison than using fixed dollar amounts, which can distort analysis as the price increases. By focusing on percentage changes, it's possible to better understand how bitcoin moves relative to its own value, rather than being skewed by absolute price changes.  The analysis reveals that the longest trading range occurred between $8,865 and $9,752, lasting for 155 days. That's not surprising as it coincided with the 2018-2019 market cycle. During this time, bitcoin was consolidating after the post-2017 bull-market peak and before the recovery that started in mid-2019. Notably, this excludes the depths of the bear market from November 2018 to May 2019, when bitcoin was trading below $5,000.  More recently, bitcoin spent 111 days between $54,271 and $59,699. And it has so far spent 126 trading days in its current range of $59,700 to $65,670, a period that could extend if history repeats itself. These prolonged periods of consolidation aren't unprecedented, as seen during the $8,000 to $12,000 range, where bitcoin traded for hundreds of days.  This historical perspective suggests that bitcoin can continue to trade in its current range until the end of October without breaking out, based on past behavior. It’s a stark reminder that bitcoin often moves in extended cycles of consolidation, only to make significant moves when least expected.  As bitcoin approaches critical levels, it’s essential to remain patient and consider these long-term trends. The market’s cyclic nature implies that while this downtrend may seem never-ending, breakouts, when they do come, often bring significant opportunities. Whether or not bitcoin breaks through $65,200 soon, understanding these trading ranges provides invaluable insight into the potential future direction of the market.  Muted drawdowns in the current cycle  These periods of consolidation and reduced volatility can be seen in a positive light. In the current cycle, drawdowns are the most muted compared to previous cycles, with the largest decline being just under 30%. This stability is crucial for new institutional investors, who may be unable to handle extreme volatility swings.  Bitcoin is currently up by less than 1% in the third quarter, with only five trading days remaining. It's been a challenging period for bitcoin, with headwinds such as a sale by the German government and Mt. Gox redemptions. Moreover, the third quarter is typically the weakest for bitcoin, according to Coinglass.

Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) To Come back From The Dead As Ascending Triangle Appears Bitcoin Registers Sixth Green Daily Candle During the first week of the month, Bitcoin saw its price struggle to keep above the $55,000 mark, plummeting to the $52,000 support zone and raising investors’ alarms. The rest of the sector followed BTC’s lead, dropping 12% to a market capitalization of $1.81 trillion earlier this month. Since then, the market has seen a significant boost, mostly fueled by the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) rate cut. Following the Fed’s announcement, the sector recovered 5%, continuing its ascending trajectory throughout the weekend. Due to the positive market sentiment, crypto investment products ended the week with $321 million in inflows, the second weekly positive net flows in a row. The inflows were led by Bitcoin-based products, which registered $284 million last week, according to the CoinShares report. BTC, propelled also by Kamala Harris’ recent acknowledgment of the crypto industry, recovered 20% from the monthly lows of September 6. The rebound pushed the cryptocurrency’s price toward the $64,000 resistance level, which was last held a month ago. After failing to reclaim the key resistance level, Bitcoin’s price has been hovering between the $63,000-$63,900 range throughout Monday morning, registering six green daily candles since September 17. Will BTC See Four Green Months In A Row? BTC’s recent price action has translated into green numbers in the month-to-date (MTD) timeframe, making September a green month for the cryptocurrency. Coinglass data reveals that the flagship crypto displays a 7.94% return MTD. This performance was noted by some market watchers, who suggest that Bitcoin is on its way to registering its best September so far. In an X post, Crypto Jelle highlighted that BTC “is currently on track for the strongest September performance in its history” after its current MTD return surpassed that of September 2016. To the analyst, the flagship cryptocurrency is preparing for a “promising” performance next quarter. Jelle also pointed out that BTC has only closed September with green numbers three times. However, the times this has happened, the cryptocurrency’s monthly returns have closed in the green for four months straight. This suggests that Bitcoin may be on the verge of a massive bull run for Q4. Close this month in the green, and the odds are high October, November and December will close green as well. He pointed out that this week will be “decision time” for the flagship cryptocurrency, as a higher high is “within an arm’s reach.” A push above the $65,000 resistance level would “flip the narrative” and see BTC moving to levels not seen since early August. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Reach $108,000 To $155,000 By 2024 End, Analyst Reveals Why The cryptocurrency’s chart displays a “massive descending broadening wedge,” which has the potential to hit $90,000 after a breakout. Ultimately, the analyst considers that Bitcoin won’t trade within this pattern for much longer. As of this writing, the flagship trades at $63,700, a 1.7% and 10% surge in the daily and weekly timeframes.

The token, according to the latest market updates, registered an almost 36% surge in price, which follows the movement of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, pushing forward the overall sentiment on the token. Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Explodes By 81% – Is $530 The Next Target? Investors are currently interested in a series of statistics showing Aptos has grown significantly since the start of the year. If the trend continues, we might see APT pushing boundaries in the coming days or weeks. Growth And Developments Fuel Investor Confidence Recently, X user @apt_everstake released an article on X regarding the platform’s metrics last month which shows great promise in the long-term prospect of the protocol. According to the article, Aptos’s active users rose to 3 million monthly active users–the numbers had surged by 11% from July. The highest point reached an active user on the platform was 450k, while average daily accounts exceeded 190k, and that increased the figures by 12% as compared to last July. https://t.co/dqi277ncfo — Aptos Nerd | Everstake (@apt_everstake) September 21, 2024 Aptos also boasted a high throughput, with a peak of 360 million transactions in one day and a transaction-per-second of 12,000. On-chain activity with the likes of Aptos attracts partners and retail investors alike. These are clear signs that the platform has a somewhat clear trajectory in the future which makes it worth investing capital on. In a tri-partnership between Aptos, Ankaa Labs, and OKX Ventures, Ankaa announced their first cohort of projects that will receive support from the Ankaa Accelerator program. According to the blog post, five projects were chosen by the partnered organizations as they saw their “significant potential to contribute to the Web3 ecosystem.” The program will fund these using their accrued $10 million investment from Aptos and OKX. Momentum Peters Out At $8.24 Although the token has moved quickly following the flip in investor sentiment, APT’s attempt to break through the $8.24 resistance level has failed leading to the token attempting to stabilize above $7.76. The previous price movement of APT led to the exhaustion of the bulls, leading to quite a bearish undertone on the otherwise great gains made in the past couple of days. The relative strength index (RSI) hints at a possible reversal in the momentum of the token, leading to a return to the $7.27 in the short to medium term. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Outshine Gold By 400% By 2025, Veteran Analyst Predicts However, the token’s high correlation with Bitcoin and, by extension, the entire market will prove to be beneficial for the bulls in the coming days.

SOL price is rising and might aim for a fresh increase above the $152 resistance zone. SOL price started a fresh increase from the $142 zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading near $1465 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $148 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $152 resistance zone. Solana Price Eyes Fresh Surge Solana price extended its increase above the $142 resistance like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL even spiked above $150 before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $152 and the price started a downside correction. There was a move below the $148 and $145 levels. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $127 swing low to the $152 high. However, the bulls were active near the $142 support zone. The price is stable above the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $127 swing low to the $152 high. Solana is now trading near $146 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $148 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $148 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $152 level. A successful close above the $150 and $152 resistance levels could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $164. Any more gains might send the price toward the $172 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $148 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $144 level. The first major support is near the $142 level. A break below the $142 level might send the price toward the $134 zone. If there is a close below the $134 support, the price could decline toward the $128 support in the near term.

42407572,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQbnv,1727160363,Bitcoin Needs to Top $65.2K to Break Downtrend: Bitfinex,"A move above the August high of $65,200 will invalidate the bearish lower highs pattern, analyst at Bitfinex said.  Weakening spot market buying pressure points to short-term consolidation, analysts added.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has rallied 16% since testing lows under $54,000 early this month. A bullish revival, however, is not yet confirmed, according to analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.  In a note shared with CoinDesk Tuesday, analysts said the cryptocurrency needs to smash the August high of $65,200 to confirm the end of a prolonged downtrend, characterized by lower price highs since March.  ""BTC is now within touching distance of the Aug. 25 top of $65,200. The reason this level is important is because since the all-time high of $73,666 was reached on March 14th, BTC has still not managed to eclipse a single high before a local/new bottom was formed. This qualifies for the technical definition of a downtrend,"" analysts said, explaining why $65,200 is the level to beat for the bulls.  The record high of over $73,000 reached on March 14, followed by the March 20 high of $60,780 and the subsequent lower highs and lower lows are represented by the falling trendline on the chart above.  ""This implies that the August 25th local high at $65,200 before our September 6th local bottom holds a lot of significance from a higher time frame perspective,"" analysts at Bitfinex noted.  In other words, a convincing move above the August high would confirm the end of the interim downtrend and a resumption of the broader uptrend from the October 2023 lows under $30,000.  The recent Fed rate cut, large stimulus announcement by China and the return of risk appetite to broader financial markets favor a move above $65,200.  One reason to be cautious is the flattening of the cumulative volume delta indicator since prices rose past $63,500 over the weekend, per data tracked by Coinalyze. It's a sign of a slowdown in the spot market buying. The global cumulative volume delta indicator measures the difference between buying and selling volumes across centralized cryptocurrency exchanges over time.  ""It is now entirely possible that the price could form a new range near current prices and consolidate for a period, as we have seen following similar previous price rallies which have been initially prompted by spot buying, but then is followed by perpetual and futures markets activity. Another cause for caution is that spot market buying has slowed. This is evident in the Figure below where we can see the spot cumulative volume delta indicator flattening out once the price moved past $63,500,"" analysts told CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/24/bitcoin-needs-to-top-652k-to-break-downtrend-bitfinex,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b58119212e48cc7b8c7b75a3473affb4381d70ab-1280x845.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
33927809,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24196,1727160362,Bitcoin “Hóa thạch”: Tương lai nào phía trước?,"Bitcoin đang dần “hoá thạch” – tức là việc thay đổi nó ngày càng khó, thậm chí là không thể. Điều này đang gây ra cuộc tranh luận nảy lửa trong cộng đồng. Bên ủng hộ cho rằng đây là dấu hiệu tốt, Bitcoin đã trưởng thành và đủ mạnh để “bất biến”. Nó như một pháo đài vững chắc, bảo vệ mạng lưới khỏi những thay đổi bất ngờ và nguy hiểm. Phe còn lại lo ngại rằng sự “bất biến” này sẽ kìm hãm Bitcoin, khiến nó không thể cập nhật để cải thiện khả năng mở rộng, bảo mật hay thêm tính năng mới. Họ sợ Bitcoin sẽ “đóng băng” mãi mãi, không thể theo kịp công nghệ mới. Cuộc tranh luận này thực sự là một bài toán khó: Liệu Bitcoin đã đủ “chín”, hay vẫn cần sự linh hoạt để thích ứng với tương lai? Những tranh luận về thay đổi giao thức Bitcoin Phe ủng hộ: Một số người cho rằng sự “cứng nhắc” là dấu hiệu tích cực của tính phi tập trung. Nó đảm bảo không một cá nhân hay nhóm nào có thể ép buộc các thay đổi có thể gây hại cho các nguyên tắc cốt lõi của Bitcoin, như tính phi tập trung hoặc bảo mật. Phía phản đối: Những người khác cho rằng sự “cứng nhắc” có thể đến quá sớm, ngăn cản các cập nhật cần thiết để cải thiện khả năng mở rộng, bảo mật và chức năng của Bitcoin. Họ lo ngại rằng nếu Bitcoin trở nên quá cứng nhắc, nó có thể không thích ứng được với các tiến bộ công nghệ trong tương lai. Tại sao một số Bitcoiner phản đối? Nguy cơ kìm hãm sự đổi mới: Sự “cứng nhắc” có thể cản trở khả năng áp dụng các công nghệ và tính năng mới của Bitcoin, dẫn đến việc Bitcoin tụt hậu so với các đối thủ cạnh tranh. Khó khăn trong việc giải quyết các vấn đề: Các lỗ hổng bảo mật hoặc lỗi có thể cần cập nhật để ngăn chặn sự cố tiềm ẩn. Nếu Bitcoin quá cứng nhắc, nó có thể khó thực hiện các thay đổi cần thiết. Làm giảm sự quan tâm của nhà phát triển: Sự đổi mới chậm có thể khiến các nhà phát triển tài năng không muốn đóng góp. Phe ủng hộ thì nghĩ gì? Ổn định và tin cậy: Sự ổn định là rất quan trọng đối với thành công lâu dài của Bitcoin như một kho lưu trữ giá trị phi tập trung, an toàn và không thể thay đổi. Giảm thiểu rủi ro: Thay đổi giao thức có thể dẫn đến các lỗ hổng hoặc hậu quả không lường trước được. Giảm thiểu thay đổi giúp hệ thống mạnh mẽ và đáng tin cậy hơn. Bảo vệ tính phi tập trung: Giữ cho giao thức tối giản giúp Bitcoin duy trì tính phi tập trung, không có nhóm nào có quá nhiều ảnh hưởng. Đổi mới trên các lớp khác: Các giải pháp lớp hai và sidechain có thể cung cấp sự linh hoạt và khả năng mở rộng mà không ảnh hưởng đến bảo mật cốt lõi của Bitcoin. Tóm lại là: Cuộc tranh luận về sự “hoá thạch” của Bitcoin phản ánh sự cân bằng giữa bảo mật và đổi mới. Trong khi một số người tin rằng sự ổn định là chìa khóa, những người khác cho rằng sự linh hoạt là cần thiết để Bitcoin phát triển. Tìm kiếm sự cân bằng giữa hai yếu tố này sẽ là thách thức quan trọng đối với cộng đồng Bitcoin trong tương lai.

Move From Bitcoin To Memecoins In Upcoming Crypto Bull Run? Crypto analyst Ardizor has outlined five memecoins to watch, anticipating that these assets could yield substantial returns as what he describes as the “biggest bull run” in crypto is set to commence in October. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Outshine Gold By 400% By 2025, Veteran Analyst Predicts According to Ardizor, Bitcoin (BTC) cycles typically begin 170 days after its Halving event and reach their peak approximately 310 days later. He suggests that starting in October, these memecoins and the broader market are positioned for significant gains that could surpass previous record highs. Ardizor emphasizes that new bull runs often begin with liquidity flowing to established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) before shifting toward memecoins, setting the stage for a potential resurgence in the sector. Five Tokens Poised For Major Gains Among the memecoins Ardizor highlights are Sundog (SUNDOG), which has rapidly gained traction within the Tron network. He notes that Sundog is rooted in community engagement, aiming to unite enthusiasts and create “an inclusive ecosystem that offers various benefits for its holders.” Currently trading at $0.31, up nearly 6% in the 24-hour time frame, and with a market cap of approximately $287.7 million, Sundog stands out as one of the most promising new entries in the memecoin landscape, according to the analyst. Another notable mention is Simon’s Cat (CAT), which has emerged as the largest and most recognized meme coin on the Binance Smart Chain (BNB). Ardizor points to its consistent price increase, noting that Simon’s Cat is backed by the well-known Simon’s Cat brand, which has garnered over 1.6 billion views on its YouTube channel. The memecoin has a market cap of around $280.6 million and is trading at $0.000040, up a substantial 96% in the last month alone, proving the analyst’s theory of further price gains and investor interest in the token. The analyst also discusses Cate on ETH (CATE), a memecoin that originated from the Dogeverse and was inspired by a tweet from the Own the Doge social media account. With strong ties to Dogecoin (DOGE), Ardizor believes that CATE embodies a “spirit of adventure and innovation”, making it an attractive option for investors looking for the next big thing in memecoins. It currently has a market cap of around $16.2 million. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 8,500% Rally For Cardano To Reach $31 As Indicators Turn Bullish In addition, Neiro (NEIRO) is highlighted as a continuation of the Doge legacy. Associated with Kabosu, the dog behind the iconic Doge meme, Ardizor contended that Neiro captures the “true essence of memecoins and internet culture.” NEIRO currently has a market capitalization of $341 million, with a notable 52% increase in the last 24 hours, resulting in a trading price of $0.0012, and over 2,325% in the last thirty days alone, making it the best performing token on Ardizor’s list. Finally, Ardizor introduces the Turbo token (TURBO), a project that began as a bold experiment in cryptocurrency creation. Inspired by artificial intelligence (AI), Turbo was initiated with a simple challenge to create the next great memecoin starting with just $69. Today, the analyst notes that it thrives as a decentralized, community-led initiative, boasting a market cap of $387 million. Currently, TURBO trades at $0.0062, recording impressive gains of 8,980% year-to-date (YTD).

42407570,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQbkc,1727158293,Ethereum ETFs Record Biggest Outflows Since July in Sign of Low Institutional Appeal,"Ether ETFs experienced the largest outflows since July, with over $79 million exiting on Monday.  The outflows were predominantly from Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), while Bitwise's ETHW saw minor inflows, highlighting the strength of Grayscale's influence on market dynamics.  Despite an 11% rise in ether due to favorable macroeconomic conditions like Fed rate cuts, the ETF outflows indicate a disconnect between prices and investor sentiment toward ether's future.  Ether may not resonate with traditional finance investors as much as bitcoin's ""digital gold"" narrative, some observers say.  Ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their largest net outflows since July, with over $79 million exiting on Monday in a sign of waning institutional demand for the world’s second-largest token.  Those figures are the highest since July 29, when ETH ETHs recorded a cumulative $98 million, and the four-highest since they first went live on July 23, data from SoSoValue shows.  Nearly all of Monday’s outflows came from Grayscale’s ETHE product. Bitwise’s ETHW recorded just over $1.3 million in inflows. Other products showed no inflow or outflow activity.  The outflow came despite a broader crypto market rally fueled by last week's Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, which helped lift ether prices by 11% over the past week. The disconnect between ETH’s price momentum and ETF flows suggests that investors remain uncertain about the asset’s long-term growth prospects.  A closely watched ratio tracking the relative price strength of ether and bitcoin {{BTC}} has dropped to its lowest level since April 2021, as CoinDesk previously reported, a sign the broader market favors bitcoin's perceived stability over ether's riskier, high-yield potential.  According to Peter Chung, head of research at Presto Labs, the Ethereum blockchain’s “world computer” narrative does not resonate as easily with traditional finance (TradFi) investors as bitcoin’s “digital gold” meme.  “TradFi investors may not respond as enthusiastically to ETH’s investment thesis than to BTC’s. Gold’s investment thesis as an inflation hedge is well-known, and therefore, it is not a leap for TradFi investors to wrap their heads around the idea of ‘digital gold,” Chung said in a message to CoinDesk, referring to an August report by the firm on the topic. “On the other hand, ETH’s ‘world computer’ narrative is much more difficult for non-technicals to grasp.  “Even if they manage to come around, their conviction level would need to be high enough to justify adding a second digital asset exposure after a BTC ETF. This could be challenging because, for those who have already allocated to a BTC ETF in their portfolio, adding another digital asset exposure provides substantially less incremental diversification benefit than the first exposure,” he said.  Bitcoin set fresh lifetime highs in March in U.S. dollars (before tumbling 20%), while ether is yet to break its highs from 2021 and is still about only half that level. Year-to-date, bitcoin has returned over 50% , while ether has gained just under 15%.  Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA.org, noted that while ETH has gained on the back of the Fed’s dovish turn, the heavy ETF outflows indicate a fragile sentiment.  “Will a continued price rally rescue ETH ETF inflows from their current doldrums? The answer likely depends on whether we see another blow-off top in equity markets before November,” Fan said. “Ethereum has gained 11% over the past week on no new developments. However, the latest heavy outflow from Ether ETFs indicates uncertain sentiment among investors on its future growth momentum.”  Nick Ruck, an independent market analyst, pointed out that the recent outflows could be linked to broader pessimism about ether's growth narrative.  “The surge in ETH ETF outflows may stem from investors allocating capital elsewhere due to the ongoing pessimistic outlook for ETH, and the current increase in the price of ETH is a good opportunity to exit the market,” Ruck said in a Tuesday message to CoinDesk. “Ethereum has been criticized recently for failing to push any narratives that could help attract more inflows. However, the new Pectra upgrade set to launch in Feb 2025 aims to enable users to pay gas fees with altcoins, among other benefits.”  “Institutional investors may feel there are better opportunities elsewhere for the time being,” Ruck added.

33924432,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644159,1727154005,Bitcoin Set for Major Bull Run? These 3 On-Chain Metrics Signal A Turning Point,"Recent data from CryptoQuant has revealed that Bitcoin may be on the cusp of a significant recovery, supported by key on-chain metrics. Particularly, according to a CryptoQuant analyst under the pseudonym Darkfost, several indicators are reaching crucial support levels, signaling a “potential long-term bullish shift.” These metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s price could experience substantial growth as market sentiment turns more optimistic. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Heading For A Bear Market? Analysts Weigh In On The Price Struggles Key On-Chain Metrics Pointing To Recovery One of the primary indicators the analyst highlights is the 7-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the Fund Flow Ratio. Currently at 0.05, this metric has historically acted as a major support line. When it reaches this level, it often marks the end of a bear market or signals the beginning of a new bullish phase. The fact that the Fund Flow Ratio is now showing a slight rebound, according to data revealed by Darkfost suggests that investors are becoming more active on exchanges, a positive sign for Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. In addition to the Fund Flow Ratio, the 30-day SMA of the Estimated Leverage Ratio is another key metric showing signs of recovery. The leverage ratio, which has formed a support range between 0.15 and 0.175, is trending upwards. This indicator measures the use of leverage in Bitcoin trading, and a rise often indicates increased market confidence. Darkfost highlighted that the approval of futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and recent developments in Bitcoin options trading would contribute to the “growing influence” of this metric. Another critical metric Darkfost outlined is the 30-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD). This indicator tracks the movement of long-term Bitcoin holders, and when it rises sharply, it usually signals the “end of a bull market,” according to the CryptoQuant analyst. This metric fluctuates between 0.1 and 0.3, indicating that long-term holders are accumulating Bitcoin. Notably, this trend suggests that seasoned investors are positioning themselves for potential future gains, which could further boost Bitcoin’s price in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Outshine Gold By 400% By 2025, Veteran Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Positive Long-Term Outlook The analysis concludes with a focus on the long-term outlook for Bitcoin. The CryptoQuant analyst believes that the recent movements in on-chain metrics are a positive signal for Bitcoin’s long-term growth. His conclusion read: I prefer to observe on-chain data from a long-term perspective. These support levels and recent movements are very positive from a long-term standpoint. As revealed in the report, the support levels identified in the Fund Flow Ratio, Leverage Ratio, and Binary CDD all point towards the conclusion of the bear market, with increasing momentum building for a future bull run. However, the timing and magnitude of the potential price increases remain uncertain.

Local equities indices rose as investors moved into stocks as a result of the measures.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} started to pare weekly gains early Tuesday, falling to $62,700 after reaching a nearly one-month high of $64,500 at the start of the week as China unveiled fresh stimulus to revive a slowing economy.  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it was cutting the reserve requirement ratio for mainland banks by 50 basis points while also lowering the seven-day reverse repo rate – the interest rate at which a central bank borrows funds from commercial banks – by 20 basis points to 1.5%. In addition, the central bank cut the minimum down payment requirement for mortgages to 15%.  BTC fell 2.2% in the past 24 hours with other major tokens also showing losses. Ether {{ETH}}, BNB Chain’s {{BNB}}, XRP {{XRP}} and Solana’s sol {{SOL}} lost up to 1.8%. Such drops are common after a large rally and may not be necessarily tied to China's rate decision.  ""Bitcoin's lack of response to this news, juxtaposed against rallying Chinese indices, highlights that its current beta appears more tightly linked to Fed policy and U.S. markets, as evidenced by near two-year high correlations with US stocks, particularly following last week's FOMC meeting,"" Rick Maeda, a Singapore-based research analyst at Presto Research, wrote to CoinDesk in a note.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a liquid fund tracking prices of the largest tokens, dropped 1.8%.  Celestia's TIA tokens were among the few gainers, adding 17% following the announcement of a $100 million fundraise in a boost to its ecosystem.  Stocks move on China cuts  While digital assets didn't respond to the Chinese rate cuts and stimulus measures, stock indices around the region were deep in the green, suggesting that local traders were more fixated on equities rather than crypto.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed 3.2% on the news, while the Shanghai Composite index added 2.3%.  In a published note, Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, wrote that the policy package is expected to weaken the yuan slightly, with the USD-CNY exchange rate rising in response to the PBOC's easing measures. However, medium-term factors like interest-rate spreads suggest a gradual appreciation of the CNY.  Presto's Maeda says that with the PBOC hinting at further rate cuts and market support, ""this decisive action comes at a critical juncture, with the [Shanghai Stock Exchange] recently dipping below the 2700 key resistance"".  Harris win unlikely to be “bearish”  Elsewhere, traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Monday market broadcast that Democrat Kamala Harris becoming the next U.S. president may not be as bearish as the market assumes.  “A Harris win this election may not be as bearish as the market thinks. In another bid to win over the crypto vote, Kamala Harris vowed at a fundraiser over the weekend to help the crypto sector grow,” QCP said. “This is on top of Anthony Scaramucci and other crypto advocates working alongside her campaign's crypto policies.”  Harris said over the weekend that the party, if elected, will “encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors,” marking one of the few times the candidate has appeared warm toward the crypto sector.

Harris Promises Support For Crypto And AI Speaking to donors at a fundraiser in New York City on Sunday, Harris outlined her economic agenda, which aims to foster innovation in the artificial intelligence (AI) and digital asset sectors while ensuring consumer protection, according to Bloomberg. At the event held at Cipriani Wall Street, Harris stated: I will bring together labor, small business founders and innovators, and major companies. We will partner together to invest in America’s competitiveness and future. We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets, while protecting our consumers and investors. Interestingly, this is Harris’ first public comment on crypto as a Democratic presidential candidate, raising expectations among investors and enthusiasts about her stance on digital assets compared to President Joe Biden’s administration. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Outshine Gold By 400% By 2025, Veteran Analyst Predicts The cryptocurrency sector is becoming increasingly influential in the 2024 presidential election, especially as industry executives and investors express frustration over what they perceive as onerous regulations under Biden. Harris’s campaign has indicated a desire to support the growth of digital assets while also advocating for necessary safeguards, particularly in light of recent “high-profile failures” in the crypto market. In contrast, former President Donald Trump, Harris’s Republican opponent, has actively courted the crypto industry, promising to replace Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler and to create a stablecoin framework. Harris Outraises Trump In August Fundraising Push Per the report, Harris’s fundraiser was a significant event aimed at bolstering her “financial advantage” in the race against former president Trump. Tickets for the event ranged from $500 to nearly $1 million, allowing top-tier donors exclusive access to meet Harris and attend additional events. Harris’s campaign has reported impressive fundraising figures, raising $361 million in August alone, contributing to $404 million in campaign funds at the start of September. This financial backing surpasses the $130 million raised by Trump and the Republican National Committee during the same period, giving Harris and the Democrats a substantial $109 million cash advantage. KAMA Surges Amid Growing Optimism For Harris’s Presidential Bid Kamala Harris’s recent statements have boosted her fundraising figures and led to gains for the memecoin KAMA, which has seen its first increase in over a month. Currently trading at $0.0052, KAMA has recorded a gain of 7.2%, recovering from a dip to $0.0500 earlier this month amidst a broader market decline. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) To Come back From The Dead As Ascending Triangle Appears Despite this recent uptick, KAMA remains down nearly 87% from its all-time high of $0.039, reached on July 24, according to CoinGecko data.

Because the discussions about digital assets policy remain high-level and aren't likely to produce a detailed stance before voters decide who to elect, the person said, this likely leaves crypto as just one item among a range of economic innovations Harris will cite on the campaign trail.  Senior Harris campaign officials have kept a dialogue running with a narrow group of industry executives and insiders, including from Ripple Labs and Coinbase Inc., said multiple people familiar with the discussions. Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, is among those who've sat down for campaign meetings.  ""The progress is real,"" he said in a Monday interview with CoinDesk. He said it's remarkable to see how far the Democratic candidate – and also her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump – have come in just a matter of weeks.  ""All we want are sensible rules, and we'll follow them,"" said Grewal, who has helped lead the company's multi-front legal battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He said he's ""encouraged"" at the response from the Harris campaign.  ""Their understanding of what the industry and crypto investors alike need from a Harris administration, should one come to pass, is growing in sophistication and depth,"" Grewal said, though the actual policy choices may not be seen for a while. ""Sometimes things just take a little bit longer than any of us might like,"" he said.  Grewal suggested the crypto discussions with both the Harris and Trump campaigns are happening on a frequent basis. Ripple declined to comment on the talks, but others at the table cautioned realism from industry folks awaiting every utterance from the Harris campaign that only began two months ago – including from adviser Brian Nelson, who had been well-versed in crypto as the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.  ""It's not as if the campaigns have the luxury to develop fully thought-out, complete approaches to regulating crypto any more than they do any other industry,"" Grewal said. ""It's just not practical or realistic to expect that.""  Former Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, said at a recent event that he's among those working with the Harris campaign on its crypto policy stance.  The vice president's campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on its crypto-policy strategy.  Harris' supportive tone in her first mention of the technology echoes President Joe Biden's earlier position on crypto, when his famous executive order suggested the White House would support technological advances and U.S. competitiveness as long as crypto developments didn't harm consumers. That March 2022 order, though, was before the collapse of FTX and several other high-profile digital assets businesses, and U.S. financial regulators moved to partially wall off the banking system from crypto and pursue dozens of legal actions.  The vice president's campaign intended her weekend remark to show that crypto enthusiasts have been heard on their hopes for a U.S. reset, according to the person with knowledge of the campaign discussions. The political calculus may not allow for much more than a rhetorical wink, since Harris can't know yet who will be steering the chambers of Congress if she wins and may need room to strategize on legislation.  For his part, Trump's rhetoric is now all-in on crypto after years of skepticism, and one of his family's latest business pursuits is in decentralized finance (DeFi), though the early information on the Trumps' World Liberty Financial has drawn some critics among crypto advocates. He's lending his support to the crypto business from the campaign trail while also pushing for pro-digital assets policies in a potential second Trump administration, which he said would ensure that the U.S. become the ""world capital for crypto.""  Polling paid for by the industry has indicated that cryptocurrency considerations could figure into voting preferences for some.  ""I think the crypto voter is speaking loud and clear in this race, and so campaigns are naturally oriented to the voices they think are going to matter most and turn out in the largest numbers come November,"" Grewal said.

33919947,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643991,1727143220,Is Altcoin Season Coming? These Two Signals Could Suggest So,"An analyst has pointed out two patterns forming in altcoin and Bitcoin-related charts that could suggest an altseason may be coming soon. Signs May Finally Be Aligning For An Altcoin Season In two new posts on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed some signals that could foreshadow an altcoin season. The first chart shared by the analyst is for the combined altcoin market cap, which is simply the combined cryptocurrency market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum. The graph shows that the total altcoin market cap has been forming a pennant recently. The pennant is a pattern in technical analysis (TA) with two components: a pole made up of the prevailing trend and a triangle or “pennant” representing consolidation. In the case of the current pennant, the sharp uptrend that the altcoin market cap saw between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 makes up for the pole portion, while the downtrend since then corresponds to the pennant. This type of pennant is popularly called a bull pennant. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Reach $108,000 To $155,000 By 2024 End, Analyst Reveals Why As is apparent in the chart, the altcoin market cap has recently been making another retest of the upper channel of the pennant. It might see a significant rally if it manages to break the resistance this time. Pennant breakouts can be the same length as the pole, so Martinez notes that the altcoin market cap could end up crossing the $1 trillion mark. Naturally, this would only be if a break does happen. The analyst sounds optimistic, though, saying, “it is just a matter of time before #altcoinseason!” The second chart that could hint towards the oncoming of an altcoin season is the market cap dominance of Bitcoin. “Market cap dominance” here refers to the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap that BTC accounts for. Here is the graph for this metric shared by Martinez, which shows the pattern that has been forming in its value recently: The Bitcoin market cap dominance appears to have been moving in a rising wedge pattern recently. The rising wedge is another TA pattern, but unlike the bull pennant forming in the altcoin market cap, this formation is considered bearish. In a rising wedge, the asset’s price moves up between converging trendlines, with its movement getting narrower as it approaches the apex. As is visible in the chart, the Bitcoin market cap dominance is nearly at the end of the rising wedge, which suggests a break under the lower channel may happen soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hype Remains Low Even After $63,000 Surge: Green Sign For Rally? The metric has a value of 57%, but the analyst notes that this bearish formation could lead to a dip toward the 47% mark, which would set the stage for the altcoin season.

33917653,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644076,1727137830,"Bitcoin Jumps 22% Post-Fed Rate Cut, Yet Key Resistance Sparks Crash Fears – Bitfinex","Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has rallied over 22% in the past two weeks to trade at around $63,200, following a significant drop to $52,000 on September 6. This is the highest level BTC has reached in almost two months. Critical Resistance At $65,200 Looms According to a recent report from digital asset trading platform Bitfinex, this price increase was largely driven by the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to cut interest rates, which helped propel BTC to a new local high of $64,200 on September 20. However, despite this positive momentum, Bitcoin is still just below a critical resistance level of $65,200, established on 25 August. The report notes that a failure to breach this level could confirm a worrying trend that has characterized BTC’s price action since its all-time high of $73,666 in March. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) To Come back From The Dead As Ascending Triangle Appears Since that peak, Bitcoin has repeatedly struggled to break previous highs before forming new local lows, indicating a persistent downtrend. This pattern of lower and lower highs is evident on the daily Bitcoin chart, suggesting that the cryptocurrency has been on a downward trajectory since mid-March. As seen on the daily BTC/USDT chart above, this repeated price action has been characterized by a sustained and continuous downtrend since the March peak. Nonetheless, further volatility fueled by macroeconomic fears triggered another crash on August 5. BTC hit its lowest level in six months, down to the $49,000 level from the $70,000 level it had been trading at since late July. What Drove Bitcoin Recent Gains? One notable concern that Bitfinex finds is the discrepancy between BTC’s price gains and open interest in future markets. As BTC rose, open interest rose even faster, reaching $19.43 billion – up from $18.93 billion on August 25- while the Bitcoin price remained around $1,000 below its local high. This divergence suggests that much of the recent price movement may be driven by speculative trading in futures and perpetual contracts rather than strong demand in the spot market. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Potential Pullback As RSI Flashes Warning: $1.4 Retest In Sight Earlier this month, Bitfinex observed that Bitcoin’s rise to around $62,000 was largely fueled by robust spot market buying, in stark contrast to the current situation. While this trend in open interest might suggest increased speculative interest in Bitcoin, it does not directly imply bearishness. The report states that open interest is not a definitive measure of leverage in the market; it merely reflects the total value of outstanding contracts. Finally, the report suggests that this renewed speculative interest could be beneficial as traders return from their summer holidays and reassess their positions following the rate cut. However, Bitfinex does note that in the absence of clearer indicators of sustained bullish momentum, market participants should remain cautious.
