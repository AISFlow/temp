42397382,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4AV8,1393630296,Optimism Grows as Mt. Gox Chapter Ends and Bitcoin Turns the Page,"The death bells tolled loudly for Mt. Gox this week as the threads of its elaborate cloak of cover-ups, lies and poor business practices came undone, first with the release of documents the revealed a struggling company desperately seeking new capital, then ultimately with its formal bankruptcy filing on 28th February.  The news reverberated beyond the industry, with mainstream media plunging headlong into the sensational story that was likened to some of the more infamous debacles in the history of the traditional financial system, such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.  Still, increased pressure from the outside world galvanized an impressive display of support and resilience from the bitcoin community as it worked to set facts straight and fight against the most recent wave of negative PR.  Notably, major names in the industry like principal of Winklevoss Capital Management Tyler Winklevoss, noted VC investor Fred Wilson and early Internet entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, along with a host of others, went on the offensive for both bitcoin the technology and bitcoin the community.  The result was a growing sentiment that an integral chapter in the bitcoin story had been written, and that the coming year will still give way to the increased investment and higher levels of adoption that were expected at the end of 2013.  Tyler Winklevoss weighs in  Tyler Winklevoss spoke out about Mt. Gox via a blog post, noting that the bitcoin market wasn't exactly suprised by the news. For example, he indicated that he personally stopped using Mt. Gox last summer, when it ""started to look like a roach motel"".  But, Winklevoss didn't just talk about bitcoin as an investment. He also embraced the idea that the sudden end to Mt. Gox was necessary for the ecosystem, citing it as evidence of the need for the US to work quickly to ensure the creation of regulated exchanges.  Said Winklevoss:  ""The Mt. Gox 'crisis', as it’s been reported, has really been more of a speed bump on the road to mainstream maturity.""  Further, he revealed that he hasn't sold any bitcoin despite the panic, saying ""in fact, I have taken this as an opportunity to buy more"" in a statement that could do much to encourage investment.  Fred Wilson reflects  In contrast to his sometimes brash public demeanor, Fred Wilson struck a more somber and reflective note in a blog post on 25th February, choosing to emphasize the sadness he felt at the passing of the first bitcoin company he transacted with.  Wilson continued, noting that bitcoin's ability to withstand such a collapse was actually an advantage over the existing financial system.  Explained Wilson:  ""The wonderful thing about a globally distributed financial network is that if one of the nodes goes down, it doesn’t take the system down.""  He also noted the increasing investment and suggested that ""failures, crashes and other messes"" are just par for the course with any new disruptive ecosystem.  Andreessen on the offensive  Noted early Internet investor Marc Andreessen was one more the more vocal voices from the bitcoin community, as he took to major news networks to defend bitcoin and its underlying technology.  Andreessen, too, suggested that bitcoin would emerge from the latest setback stronger than ever, now famously stating that Mt. Gox ""had to die"" as part of this transition. He'll likely have more time to help move this narrative forward at coming major industry events.  For a full review of the Mt.

42397377,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Ab2,1393626397,"Alleged Mt. Gox Victim Files Class Action Lawsuit, Now His Lawyers Speak Out","The fallout from Mt. Gox’s 28th February bankruptcy filing is already in full swing, as one bitcoin investor has filed a class action lawsuit in Chicago on behalf of the alleged victims of the troubled Japan-based exchange and its CEO, Mark Karpeles.  Gregory Greene and his lawyer Steven Woodrow, a partner at the Edelson law firm in Denver, Colorado, filed a complaint against Mt. Gox and Karpeles in the U.S. District Court on Thursday, claiming the company was fraudulent and negligent in its failure to protect customers against theft.  Woodrow, who submitted the lawsuit to the Northern District of Illinois in the U.S. District Court, stated his position on the filing, saying:  ""This is a case of serial mismanagement, if not outright fraud, by Karpeles and Mt. Gox.""  Greene estimates that his stake of bitcoins tied up in Mt. Gox is around $25,000. Still, the reported shortage of 850,000 bitcoins at Mt. Gox puts the total estimated value of lost bitcoins at over $475m at today’s market price, meaning the lawsuit could be the first of many.  Edelson partner Chris Dore spoke to CoinDesk about the case, confirming that interest in joining the class action is already high.  Framing the case  Dore said that the Mt. Gox case is a natural extension for his law firm, which specializes in consumer tech cases relating to online privacy and data breaches. He noted that though this is the law firm's first bitcoin case, they've been interested in the space for some time and even ""started investigating"" the Mt. Gox incident before they were contacted by Greene.  As for whether they'll be able to try the case in the US in light of Mt. Gox's status as a Japan-based organization, Dore was unconcerned, saying:    ""We moved under US law. They have a US entity that is here and they do business in the US, so at the most basic level they've subjected themselves to the jurisdiction of the US.            So, we don't have to worry about Japanese laws and how they apply.""            Dore admitted there would likely be ""some issues"" given the company's location, but said he's ""confident that [his firm] can work through those"" on behalf of its clients.  Failure to provide security  Central to Greene's case it seems will be the assertion that Mt. Gox had the obligation to uphold appropriate security on behalf of customers, and that this failure amounted to negligence.  Argues Greene in a statement:  ""Mt. Gox intentionally and knowingly failed to provide its users with the level of security protection for which they paid.""  Dore echoed this concern, stating:    ""Part of the reason that you pay a company like this is to provide a security service. Part of that fee is the promise they're making to keep their money safe.""              The lawyer continued alleging that Mt. Gox effectively allowed a ""slow bleed hack"" to occur, one that its purportedly improper accounting practices were ill-equipped to detect.    Valuing the loss  Dore indicated that exactly how class members would be reimbursed, if needed, was still ""an open question,"" but that he already sees a number of ways any lost bitcoins can be properly valued.  In particular, Dore suggested that prices could be fixed at the time of Mt. Gox's decision to abruptly suspend service, or at any other similar point.  ""There is a sliding scale because it is a fluctuating currency, but you can look at it from a timing perspective.""  As to the issue of whether any bitcoins will prover recoverable, Dore, too, was optimistic. Said Dore:    ""Simply because you've declared bankruptcy doesn't mean that you have no money. We don't know, that's the bottom line. That's what the purpose of the lawsuit is, to uncover where the money went.""            First lawsuit of many  Greene’s lawsuit is seeking class action status for himself and other Mt. Gox users, who are asking for monetary damages and restitution. Unfortunately for many, Dore indicated that the class is limited to US citizens only. However, he did state that his firm may file a similar suit on behalf of clients in Canada and other jurisdictions.  Still, interest in the US is high, as Dore indicated, saying:  ""Since we've been sitting here on the phone, I've seen three emails come in.""  It’s not yet clear who will represent Mt. Gox in its defense, though Baker & Mackenzie, the law firm that represents Mt. Gox in Japan has been named as a possibility.  Baker & Mackenzie declined to comment on the article. For more on the case, view the full filing below.

42397371,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4AU9,1393619458,HighKart Launches as India’s First Bitcoin E-Tailer,"HighKart.com has become the first e-commerce site in India to exclusively accept bitcoin as a payment method.  Launched by Delhi-based entrepreneur Amit Kumar, the online store retails more than 150 products, ranging from digital currency mining equipment to fashion accessories.  Currently, there are more than 500 e-commerce startups in India – most having popped up within the last five years. Companies like Flipkart are dominating the local market, making it difficult for new players to enter.  HighKart  is taking an unusual, and brave, route into this mêlée by eliminating the large potential consumer base that uses fiat currencies and opting to accept only bitcoin.  However, HighKart’s model relies on rejecting fiat in order to turn over profits. Kumar explains that being an exclusively bitcoin retailer helps him offer competitive prices because he does not have to pay commission to payment processors. He added:  “I can also hold onto the bitcoin and wait for the valuation increase and still make money out of it, which is not possible with the fiat currency.”  Bank jitters  While HighKart is not the first Indian business to say ‘yes’ to bitcoin, other ventures are accepting it alongside fiat.  WeRwired  , a Bangalore-based geospatial, security and entertainment consulting company, is one of them. The owners started accepting bitcoin payments in order to give more choice to their customers, they say.  Castle Bloom  , a salon in Chandigarh, became the first physical outlet to start accepting the digital currency late last year. However, that honour was short-lived and they reversed their decision following the recent Reserve Bank of India raids on bitcoin exchanges. Castle Bloom refused to comment further.  Those raids, along with an RBI warning on virtual currencies, have raised alarm in the Indian bitcoin community, but Kumar is not worried about the warnings because he says that all of the products in his catalogue are legal in India.  He says that a big reason for starting this venture was to get people to start using their bitcoin, as opposed to simply holding them:    “In the Indian ecosystem, bitcoin is still just a holding asset – this is not going to help the Indian bitcoin community to grow.      If you want to make it a sustainable currency in the longer run, then there should be an intrinsic value to the currency. And that comes when you start using that currency.”    Kumar is so confident about his business model that he is planning to expand its operations in the American market as well.  Coins in the wrong basket  While HighKart is the first stab at a bitcoin-exclusive e-commerce venture in India, many other enterprises are already up and running. Currency exchanges are the most popular bitcoin-based business right now.  Venture capitalist Maninder Gulati says, however, that both e-commerce and exchanges are not useful for the Indian bitcoin ecosystem at the moment.  Gulati is the vice president at Lightspeed Ventures, a company that has invested in three bitcoin startups including BTC China.  “Most of the startups that have come about have taken a short-term view,” he explained. “Their view is ‘let me build an exchange’ rather than actually solving some of the core problems: liquidity, awareness, convenience, security.”  He is encouraging entrepreneurs to take a different approach:  “If I was an entrepreneur, I would look at things differently. I would say, what is really the India-specific case that solves a certain problem using bitcoin that cannot be solved otherwise. E-commerce is not that problem right now.”  Another concern with launching a bitcoin e-commerce site in India is the low popularity of digital currencies in the country. However, Kumar debunks that myth:  “There is a misconception about the bitcoin community in India being small. People have bitcoin; they are just afraid to use it. We are getting orders from very remote parts of India, which we never imagined.”  Man with card image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/02/28/highkart-launches-as-indias-first-bitcoin-e-tailer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63ee5a5019e33edc822385de25544a00bb4e2060-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397388,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Aks,1393615080,Why Citigroup’s ‘Three Risks Facing Bitcoin’ is Misguided,"In the wake of massive problems that brought down the Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, some seem to think that bitcoin is experiencing a crisis of sorts.  For those who have long known about the problems and possible hazards of Mt. Gox, however, this news doesn’t seem incredibly startling.  For the financial establishment, though, Mt. Gox’s ineptitude appears to be bitcoin’s fatal blow.  An example of this thinking comes from a report written by Citigroup currency strategist Steven Englander.  In his note to clients outlined in the Wall Street Journal and titled “Bitcoin Becomes Even More Speculative”, three risks are pointed out:        1) Bitcoin traders and potential investors lose confidence in the security and safety of bitcoin transactions and holdings.  2) Other digital currencies start eating into bitcoin’s market share, taking away some of the first-mover advantage.  3) “Competition emerges from conventional financial institutions using generic bitcoin technology, without the decentralization and within the conventional regulatory framework.”      Or, more concisely:    3 Risks for Bitcoin? 1. Joe Public Runs Off In Fear 2. New, Better Currencies 3. Big banks take the good, junk bad http://t.co/mUmHvjk45y      — Bitcoin (@Bitcoin) February 26, 2014    Let’s examine those possibilities.  1. Joe Public Runs Off  It doesn’t appear that bitcoin traders have been deterred from the wreckage of Mt. Gox. In fact, the price has rebounded somewhat. This would refute the claim made that bitcoin is becoming more speculative – people are buying in, and staying in.  The reality is that unlike the failure of Mt. Gox last April, there is better infrastructure around bitcoin than there was previously.  At that time, prices hit $259.34 on the Bitstamp exchange and then crashed down to a low of $45 when Mt. Gox went down. That constitutes an 83% price decrease in the value of bitcoin.  Fast-forward to this week and the big Mt. Gox shock, Bitstamp’s high was $646 and dropped to just $400, a 38% decrease. The numbers aren’t swinging nearly as wildly.  In fact, traders who got in around that $400 mark were in at a good position to take advantage the swing back up to almost $600 again, just a few days later.  Travis Skweres is the co-founder and CEO of US-based exchange CoinMKT. He sees the Mt. Gox issue as a mere blip:    “While it’s true that the recent events at Mt. Gox have been troubling, bitcoin itself as a currency and protocol are all still the same.      If anything, this paves the way for more legitimate companies to step in and build out the ecosystem.”    2. New, Better Currencies  Englander makes the assessment that bitcoin will only have a first-mover advantage in the short term. He thinks that other currencies will take away from its popularity.  The most popular alternative cryptocurrency right now is litecoin. The founder of litecoin, Charlie Lee, took the source code of bitcoin and tweaked it for his creation. Litecoin creates more coins over time and thus confirms transactions faster. It currently trades at around US$14.  Charlie Lee has publicly said that he believes that litecoin is the “silver to bitcoin’s gold”. He is a strong believer in the value of gold, and created litecoin as a viable alternative.  There's nothing wrong with altcoins, but the idea that litecoin or some other cryptocurrency is going to suddenly rise up and take over bitcoin doesn’t sound plausible.  As cryptocurrencies gain traction, there will be room for a few global ones and other smaller specific ones. This is similar to what we see in fiat currencies today.  Jeremy Liew is a venture capitalist with Lightspeed Venture Partners. He believes that the open ethos of bitcoin means that it will remain a bellwether within the decentralized currency space. He said:    “I think [bitcoin being usurped by another digital currency] is unlikely – there’s too much network effect around bitcoin already.      The beauty of the open source nature of bitcoin is that any ‘bugs’ get fixed if there is sufficient consensus to do so.”    3. Big Banks Take the Good, Junk Bad  It makes sense that banks would like to replicate the positive aspects of bitcoin. The problem is, they will not have a lot of tolerance for its decentralized nature.  The article ”Why Bitcoin Matters to Bankers” by American Banker newspaper's Marc Hochstein is a fascinating read. It takes a deep look at the financial industry’s mind-set toward the concept of transactions without a third party.  It’s not something that gels with the status quo, to say the least.  Dan Held, Product Manager at Blockchain.info, echoed that sentiment:  “Financial institutions could utilize generic bitcoin technology. However, people use bitcoin exactly because it is decentralized and can’t be controlled by any single entity.”  It is obvious, however, that decentralization is going to have to mean some sort of standardization. Regulation is coming, and it should lend legitimacy to cryptocurrencies, as well as help grow a new economy around their efficient financial technologies.  Or, as Liew the Lightspeed VC, puts it:  “The decentralized nature of bitcoin, or any virtual currency, is core to the value proposition. But the conventional regulatory framework part, I think is inevitable.”  And finally...  For a long time, Mt. Gox carried a price premium. It held the top end of bitcoin valuations across all USD/BTC exchanges. Some have speculated that that came from it having the highest exchange trading volume for US dollars.  Others believe that, because users could not easily obtain US dollar withdrawals, it created an incentive for leaving their bitcoin with Mt. Gox.  Whatever the reason, Held believes that Mt. Gox’s prices always reflected the risk that people were taking by doing business with the exchange, even at the end:  “The price of Mt. Gox bitcoin was $135 when [the exchange] ceased trading, whereas the price of bitcoin on Bitstamp was approximately $600. The price of Mt. Gox bitcoin was trading like a junk bond. [The company’s] insolvency was already priced into the market.""  Now, prices are back up and bitcoin business continues.  “I don’t think the market sentiment was shaken that much by Mt. Gox’s insolvency,” said Held.

42425529,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIHCxh,1393608433,"You Can't Beat the Numbers, Signs of the Times, and Full Marx for Bitcoin","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 28th February 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most thought-provoking and most controversial events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of scepticism and wonder.      Your host … John Law.    Unthinking the thinkable  As it was written, so it came to pass – Mt. Gox has finally imploded and the hunt is on for Mark Karpeles. What finance system can cope with the collapse of one of its major historical drivers and the loss of a substantial percentage of its worth?  Meanwhile, US Senator Joe Manchin has demanded that bitcoin be banned, because of terrorists and drug lords and most probably satanists drinking the blood of boll-weevils.  It’s worth wondering what would actually destroy bitcoin, and what a ban would actually look like. It turns out that both are remarkably hard.  A major flaw in the cryptographic structure of the Bitcoin protocol would do it, destroying the integrity of the block chain or creating billions of fake coins indistinguishable from those legitimately mined.  That’s roughly the same order of likelihood as the basic security crypto of the Internet being hosed – so worry about that instead of bitcoin, if you’re so minded.  Other than that – well, even if consumer confidence is utterly destroyed in bitcoin as an investment vehicle and the price collapses to five dollars or five cents, John Law will be first in the queue to buy a whole bunch.  Bitcoin is useful, and whether it costs a thousandth of a bitcoin or ten thousand to buy wine online cheaper than with a credit card, who cares? That intrinsic utility cannot be destroyed.  So what if it’s made illegal? Bitcoin is crypto, and crypto is maths, and maths is notoriously hard to ban.  In the 1990s, cryptographer Phil Zimmerman invented PGP, a crypto system so powerful the US government classified it as a munition and banned its unlicensed export – with maximum sanctions of a million dollars and ten years in jail for those who failed to comply.  Zimmerman had made it public and it took no time to make its way outside the US. For his pains, he was investigated for three years – but the absurdity of trying to control something that was simple enough to be printed on a T-shirt eventually got through, even to the government. PGP ideas are in bitcoin, by the way: it’s good to share.  The most a state can do is make it illegal to deal in bitcoin – but then you have to define ‘bitcoin’ in a way that doesn’t outlaw all encrypted token transfer systems, but does catch all cryptocurrencies. Good luck with that. (Of course, if you’re not too bothered with legal niceties such as defining what you’re banning, you can do what you like. But let’s pretend you’re in favour of the rule of law.)  John Law can’t help but imagine legislators arguing late into the night about how big the red flag should be that has to be walked in front of those new-fangled motor cars, while a thousand inventors are firing up the welding torches with evil grins on their faces.  And as for Mt. Gox – if the mainstream financial systems coped as well with massive fraud and illicit trading as bitcoin has with Karpeles’ billion-dollar misdemeanours, then a lot more people would still have jobs.  You can’t un-invent an idea, and that’s what it would take.  Scans, not scandals  Unwinding the mess left at the end of the Cold War is taking some time, and it’s not always pretty.  Far from being ‘the end of history’, as Francis Fukuyama unwisely suggested, it’s generating plenty of its own. This year’s flashpoint is the Ukraine, which is combining economic collapse with a spot of East v West shenanigans.  As usual, this is making life difficult for people who don’t have an enormous military to deploy but would nevertheless quite like to sort things out. Money is short and that makes everything hard – hey, bitcoin! As a result, some clever thinking has seen protesters holding up signs with QR-codes on for bitcoin wallets, soliciting international donations via social networks.  This is a neat idea; one kid with a smartphone can reach more people in an hour than Bono could in a month and at no cost – and the message contains the method of payment. It’s not as if it’s easy to do much with bitcoin out there, but there are options.  But be careful because it’s so easy to generate and propagate such pictures, it’s also easy to tamper with them. You don’t even need Photoshop – MS Paint is powerful enough for a miscreant to take one such picture and paste in their own QR-code.  Push that out through a fake Twitter account, and you have a clever but abhorrent equivalent of the fake Oxfam collectors that were going door-to-door “for the Somerset floods”, only far harder to catch.  There’s no evidence of this happening, but it will – it’s too easy and safe for the perpetrators. To guard against it, John Law suggests, spend some time tracking down the original of any picture soliciting donations you’re tempted to support.  Bonus points for pictures of known provenance – a newspaper or mainstream media website where the photo is credited to one of their own photographers, or one from a known agency. Extra bonus points if there’s video footage, or different shots from different sources.  Despite the potential for hijacks John Law would like to see more QR-codes on banners during protests. They don’t have to be for donations, they can go to web pages or videos or, well, anything digital.  Perhaps pictures of kittens. Because if it’s kittens versus balaclava’d thugs with machine guns, global support can go only one way.  Strike while the irony’s hot  John Law knows he bashes on about it, but we haven’t started to see what bitcoin technology can do over and above online shopping or haircuts for hipsters.  Take the sad story of Rhythm & Hues – a top-notch computer graphics company in California. It’s been around for twenty five years, and recently saw its work win an Oscar for Life of Pi.  Yet the Oscar came eleven days after the company had gone bankrupt. Life of Pi, which is around 70% computer generated, has made something like half a billion dollars.  Rhythm and Hues went down because just about all VFX (video effects, in industry parlance) companies go bankrupt. A combination of international tax subsidies, Hollywood accounting and fixed-price contracts with open-ended work requirements makes it almost inevitable, destroying lives in the process.  If you want to know the details and have half an hour to spare – and especially if you love film – then this sad but compelling documentary will repay your attention.  At heart, though, the problem is a massive imbalance of power between the money men and the creative workers, creating exploitation of the sort that unions evolved to remedy. But it’s next to impossible to unionise creative types, who love their work too much, and especially when the work can go elsewhere in a microsecond.  If Hollywood had to pay animators per hour, as almost everyone else gets paid in films, you can be sure the demands for extra work would end. VFX companies would prosper. Hollywood doesn’t want this – which, for an industry based on stories of redemption and the little guy winning against the odds, is ironic enough for any screenwriter.  So how can bitcoin help? Well, there’s one aspect of VFX that is constant across the industry and over which Hollywood has no control – the software tools that are used to make the images. Complex, expensive and pretty standard, you have to use them to be competitive. This software, like most software, isn’t sold – it’s licensed to companies, who have to obey the licensing conditions.  So what if one of those conditions was that its users had to belong to a workers’ collective and abide by its rules? In exchange, each user would get anonymous, non-transferable voting rights for that collective, so would get to set and agree those self-same rules.  All users could – in fact, would have to – use that power to agree what they want. It might look like the worst sort of coercion, a guild system with forced membership, but it also looks awfully like real democracy.  Bitcoin – or rather, the bitcoin technology for distributing and accounting for anonymous but unfakeable tokens – would create that voting system.  With the proof-of-work side of things too, it would automatically audit the amount of work done on projects: a very hard to corrupt system that would put a ton of power back in the hands of the workers. They wouldn’t have to down tools – the tools would go down in sympathy, by themselves.  There are plenty of problems with this. John Law can’t see the software makers being very comfortable with it – although a well-run industry with an equitable work-reward structure would be in their interests as much as it is everyone else’s.  But it is worth thinking such ideas. A very great deal of the advantages of technology are automatically co-opted by big business, to the detriment of individual workers. Be nice to redress the balance: digital Marxism without the dictators is quite the utopian fantasy.  They could even make a film about it.  John Law is an 18th Century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

42374536,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlH0N,1393605006,Bitcoin ‘Shopping List’ Aims to Raise High Street Awareness,"For many involved in the world of crytocurrencies, their use is as simple as handing over cash to pay for groceries in the supermarket. But do you ever wonder whether awareness of bitcoin is reaching the rest of the population?  The digital currency has featured heavily in the news over recent months, thanks largely to its astonishing price spikes and more recently with the news of Mt. Gox’s likely insolvency, so it would be fair to assume most people have heard of bitcoin and have some idea about how to use it, right?  It seems not. A new survey conducted in the UK by communications agency Clarity suggests that while just over half of people have heard of bitcoin, only 5% have used it, and 18% would consider using it. The rest disagreed (29%) or had no opinion (53%).  Reasons for this general reluctance were cited by Clarity as being down to “a level of indifference and a lack of understanding” concerning the young currency.  In turn, the survey revealed that 63% of the 2,065 online consumers polled admitted they did not know enough about bitcoin, while lack of experience and concerns about security were worries for just over half the people asked.  Concerns about the legality of bitcoin were an issue for 29% of respondents.  Niche currency  Clarity co-founder and bitcoin owner Jason Navon said the current awareness and usage of bitcoin are impressive, however:  “[Bitcoin] is still very much used by a niche audience.”  To address the issue “that British consumers lack understanding of digital currencies like bitcoin”, Clarity has come up with its own ‘bitcoin price index’ that lists a variety of items, divided into the categories: Daily Essentials, Out & About, Travel & Leisure and Bigger Ticket Items – each with their costs in bitcoin.  However, it should be noted that these price index conversions were carried out with 1 BTC being worth £420 ($703), so these prices may be a little higher in the current climate.  Bitcoin shopping list  So, if you have ever wondered how much of your stockpile of bitcoins you would burn up if you splashed out on a fancy London mews apartment, the answer is here: 16,547.619 BTC, based on a price of just below £7m ($11.7m).  Slightly more prosaically, some daily groceries were priced in bitcoin to give an idea of how much a trip to the corner store might set you back.  That loaf of bread we mentioned will cost 0.0024 BTC, 2.5 kilos of potatoes 0.0054 BTC and a whole chicken 0.0119 BTC.  Going upmarket  Luxury items like a romantic break in Paris will cost bitcoiners 1.6284 BTC, while a new VW Golf five-door automobile 47.9405 BTC and a flight into space with Virgin Galactic a mere 372.0238 BTC.  Getting the ball rolling  Clarity claims that people need to understand cryptocurrencies in the context of purchases, both big and small.  “Our bitcoin price index aims to start that process by showing people what things would cost in the digital currency.”  The full bitcoin ‘shopping list’ can be seen here.

42425521,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIHCfh,1393600280,"Vietnam Warns Against Bitcoin, Invokes the Ghost of Gox","Vietnam's State Bank has issued another statement warning against bitcoin, blocking credit institutions from offering any digital currency services.  Authorities had already issued a strong warning back on 14th February, stating that the government and State Bank did not recognize bitcoin as a legitimate method of payment.  It also contained all the usual admonitions about money laundering, tax evasion, illicit trade, and the risk of speculation. Consumers would have no protection in the event of investment loss, the statement says.  It stopped short of explicitly banning anyone other than banking-related businesses from using bitcoin, however.  Mt. Gox features  While the warning is similar to others we've seen before, there are a couple of notable differences this time around. An automated translation of the Vietnamese language statementhttp://vnbitcoin.com/2014/02/28/ngan-hang-nha-nuoc-canh-bao-ve-tien-ao-bitcoin/ shows that it mentions the recent collapse of Mt. Gox and brief pauses on other exchanges like Bitstamp due to hacking attempts as part of the threat.  Almost in the same breath, it claims US authorities have arrested four people suspected of using bitcoin for criminal transactions (how this is related to Bitstamp or Mt. Gox doesn't appear to be clarified).  This is new, and could be a sign authorities in other countries may start to haul out Mt. Gox as the new bitcoin bogeyman to frighten the public now that Silk Road is becoming a distant memory.  A global effort  The statement also refers to warnings issued by other countries: namely Thailand, Russia, France, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Norway as evidence the bitcoin menace is international.  It doesn't mention, however, that at least two of those countries (France, Malaysia and possibly Indonesia) have chosen to avoid any restrictions on bitcoin for now.  Norway  has said little about it at all, save for an interview with a tax official who said bitcoin ""doesn't fall under the usual definition of money"" and claimed it was an asset.  Vietnam and the internet  This recent thread on reddit detailed one local bitcoin enthusiast's struggles to bring bitcoin use to Vietnam. As well as the common global barrier of bitcoin ignorance, there was also some resistance from the country's state-run media.  While Vietnam has liberalized its economy and become more business-friendly over the past couple of decades, it remains a communist state with a government suspicious of what too much economic and personal freedom might bring.  A 2012 Reporters Without Borders report said the authorities kept a firm control over the official media with censorship and Internet filtering, and regularly arrested bloggers and other citizens for online behavior. It is the ""world’s second biggest prison for netizens after China,"" the report continued.

Back in December it was rumoured that Fortress had plans to launch a bitcoin investment fund. The news was first reported by CNN, but it could not be confirmed until now.  Fortress is said to be developing a new investment vehicle based on bitcoin which is expected to be an unlisted Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).  The move appears to have been connected to San Francisco-based Pantera Capital. Pantera then registered an investment advisor entity called Pantera Bitcoin Advisors LLC and it filed the necessary paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  $20m for bitcoins last year  According to the 10-K filed with the SEC by Fortress, the investment group set aside $20m for the purchase of bitcoins in 2013. The $20m represents a balance sheet investment by Fortress, and no Fortress-managed funds were used in conjunction with the purchase.  The filing was scrutinized by Gil Luria, who tweeted that Fortress may be the first publicly traded company to report substantial bitcoin holdings.    Looks like $FIG Fortress Investments first public company to own #bitcoin http://t.co/fc6K7jSJQB @inthepixels      — Gil Luria (@gilluria) February 28, 2014    As of 31st December, Fortress reported having $16,260,000 worth of bitcoins – listed as “other assets”. In addition, Fortress reported $3,702,000 of losses or unrealized gains on its bitcoin investments, but there is a bit of a caveat, as Fortress points out:    “Digital Currency (Bitcoin) - Represents Fortress's holdings of digital currency which is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. If fair value is below cost, Fortress records an unrealized loss measured as the excess of cost over fair value of the digital currency. Subsequently, to the extent that fair value increases, Fortress records an unrealized gain but shall not report digital currency above cost.      Fortress determines fair value based on estimated exit value using significant observable inputs as of the balance sheet date. Fortress recorded $3.7 million in unrealized losses on digital currency during 2013, which was included in gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.”    Still, with a balance sheet of $2.6bn, the move represents a relatively small investment for the company that may be immaterial given its holdings.  But, though the purchase may be exploratory, the price of bitcoin has dropped quite a bit since late 2013, so the $3.7m figure might be even lower now, provided Fortress is still holding on to the coins. It notably did not disclose the holdings in its third quarter filings.  What's the endgame?  There has been quite a bit of interest in digital currencies from institutional investors. Several interesting reports have been published over the last week, including bullish reports from Wedbush Securities and PriceWaterhouseCoopers.  The Winklevoss twins are also vying for a slice of the market through the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. The pair have recently filed a revised ETF with the SEC, but it is still unclear when the Winklevoss ETF will launch.  Many of these developments have been overshadowed by the highly publicised collapse of Mt. Gox, DDoS attacks on major exchanges and the arrest of Charlie Shrem. However, if major institutional investors are serious about investing in bitcoin, a deflated price could be just what they need.

42425516,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIHCZh,1393591217,BitTorrent Client Integrates Bitcoin Donations,"Popular BitTorrent client Frostwire has integrated an experimental mechanism that will allow users to donate bitcoins to torrent sharers. In addition to bitcoin, the same mechanism can be used for litecoin, dogecoin and even PayPal.  FrostWire believes the idea will allow small content creators to easily monetize their content simply by getting tips from those who download it using the P2P client. Needless to say, Big Content is probably not thrilled by the prospect of decentralised content markets, let alone the fact that the technology could even be used to monetize piracy.  However, that is not what FrostWire has in mind, not even close.  Fighting piracy through P2P?  In fact, Frostwire developers believe they are combating piracy by adding the tip mechanism. FrostWire’s Angel Leon told Torrentfreak:  “We believe piracy is best fought by giving consumers the options of getting legal content, and we want to build solutions that use this technology to empower content creators no matter how big or small they are. We want them to try BitTorrent as an alternative, an additional channel. We think it will be easier to convince more and more artists to join us with the new possibilities.”  “Putting it bluntly, Bitcoin and BitTorrent integration give us the tools to create the P2P equivalents of iTunes and Netflix, which are centralized venues which work great for big content but not so much for the little guys who have to jump through many hoops to get in.”  If piracy scares Big Content, then this idea could leave it shell-shocked. Depending on how it is implemented, it could allow just about anyone to monetize huge amounts of content with relatively little in the way of resources and infrastructure. The P2P network would provide both the hardware and bandwidth, as well as cash.  FrostWire sees endless possibilities  In addition to simply selling content via P2P networks, using P2P currencies, FrostWire believes the concept could be applied to other commercial and non-commercial ideas.  Leon believes it could result in a decentralised media store owned by nobody and available to all. The network would allow content creators to deal directly with customers, eliminating corporate interests in the process.  Cutting out the middleman tends to be good for business, so content prices could go down, while at the same time content creators could earn even more than they would if they used a traditional publisher or distributor.  It would also give content creators more freedom, as they would not have to water down their works to meet corporate standards. In other words, it may lead to even more explicit lyrics, mental bass lines and gratuitous nudity in videos.  Non-commercial efforts could help charities raise more money and more awareness, simply by tapping P2P networks with the help of a few popular artists. Artists could share content, while people who enjoy it could make bitcoin donations to their charity of choice.  It sounds like a very practical and useful concept, but at the end of the day it still relies on people – which might not be a bad thing.  From a moral perspective, it is one thing to rip off a huge corporation by illegally downloading its content – as many people simply don’t care.  However, they might think twice if their cash is going directly to the artist and if the price is much lower without corporate middlemen.

Gox is officially filing for bankruptcy protection with an outstanding debt of ¥6.5bn ($63.6m), finally admitting openly that 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins and 100,000 of the company's own have been lost.  The exchange's lawyer announced the news during a conference at the Tokyo District Court late on Friday afternoon, Japan time. CEO Mark Karpeles, wearing a suit and tie, bowed deeply in the tradition of disgraced Japanese business leaders fronting the media.  The 850,000 BTC loss figure is higher than the 744,400 figure mentioned in the so-called ""Crisis Strategy Draft"" document leaked and released by Ryan Galt, aka The Two-Bit Idiot, earlier in the week.  That same document also described fiat assets of $32.43m and liabilities of $55m. The assets include $5m ""held by CoinLab"" and another $5.5m “held by the DHS”. The Department of Homeland Security seized that amount from Mt. Gox's US accounts in mid 2013, claiming it had not registered properly as a money transmission business.  Nightmare week  It's been a nightmare week for Mt. Gox and its customers, with much of the situation's true nature still mired in online speculation, rumor and conspiracy theories. The exact fate of all Mt. Gox customers' bitcoins is still unclear: how such an amount came to be lost or stolen without anyone knowing or taking action, whether 'transaction malleability' was indeed behind it, or whether they were transferred to other addresses or lost to the bitcoin network altogether.  CEO Karpeles resigned his position on the Bitcoin Foundation Board just four days ago, beginning a chain of events that culminated in today's press event. Shortly after that, Mt. Gox's entire Twitter history disappeared, the 'crisis' documents were leaked, and then the website went completely offline, taking with it most customer hopes of ever seeing their money again.  The domain mtgox.com now features only a blank page with the Mt. Gox logo and two short statements, one of which reads ""In light of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox's operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.""  The most recent, from 26th February, reassures everyone that Karpeles is still in Japan and ""working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues.""  While no regulatory action is guaranteed in Japan, federal prosecutors in New York City have subpoenaed Mt. Gox and requested that it preserve documents that may be relevant.  Protest ends, customers lament  Kolin Burges, who triggered media interest around the world with his protest outside Mt.

The Texas-based mining outfit has announced the shipment of its 1,000th mining rig and it claims that CoinTerra hardware is now powering 6% of the Bitcoin network.  The company says that over the course of four weeks its miners accounted for 1.7 petahash of bitcoin mining performance, slightly more than 6% of the entire network.  New TerraMiner IV batches on schedule  CoinTerra says its second manufacturing facility is now operating at full capacity and that it is churning out the February batch of orders. Further batches of TerraMiner IV rigs are on track and they should be delivered on schedule. The first batch was shipped a month ago. Ravi Iyengar, CoinTerra's CEO, said:  “We handed over the very first TerraMiner to a customer at the end of January and now I am very pleased to say that we have shipped over 1,000 TerraMiners and are at full production volume.”  It should be pointed out that the CoinTerra IV launch did not go as smoothly as planned. A few weeks ago it emerged that production units were falling short of the promised 2TH/s mark. They were running at 1.63TH/s to 1.72TH/s and they consumed between 1900W and 2100W rather than 1650W as projected by the designers.  At the time, Iyengar admitted the rig was somewhat under spec. He added that the company is already working on improvements to address the performance issue and bring it up to spec.  It appears that performance was affected by power circuit inefficiencies on the boards, not the GoldStrike I ASIC used in the rigs.  Going local  CoinTerra likes to point out that its mining hardware is engineered in Austin and assembled in Central Texas, making it a proud member of Austin’s “Silicon Hills” tech community. The company also announced that it will be sponsoring the Texas Bitcoin Conference, which takes place on March 5th and 6th in the Circuit of the Americas. Paul Snow, President of the Texas Bitcoin Association, said:  “The world-wide Bitcoin community will be heading to Austin next week for the inaugural Texas Bitcoin Conference and we could not wish for a more appropriate headline sponsor than Austin’s very own CoinTerra.”  The company is currently taking orders for the latest latest batch of TerraMiner IV miners, as well as the and the recently announced GSX I water cooled PCIe card for PC miners.

42425522,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIHCjh,1393565022,Bitcoin Transaction Fees To Be Slashed Tenfold,"The bitcoin developers are about to reduce the transaction fees on the bitcoin network tenfold, thanks to the relatively high value of the digital currency.  Transaction fees are small amounts paid to send bitcoin transactions around the network (think of them like postage stamps) and to get miners to confirm them by including them in a mining block. They're paid in satoshis (tiny amounts of bitcoins), which means that as the price of bitcoin rises, the transaction fees get higher.  Recent fluctuations in the bitcoin world may have set the price yo-yoing, but that doesn't mean that it isn't doing relatively well. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index is still hovering in the $540 range at the time of writing, a little over six times the price last July, when the Index was first introduced.  Making it cheaper to send transactions  The core developers first started discussing the possibility of slashing transaction fees for the coin around three months ago, in this post on the mailing list. At the time, developer Mike Hearn mentioned that the last reduction in transaction fees were about six months earlier, from 50k satoshis to 10k satoshis, in the 0.8.2 release of the reference client (which was released in May 2013).  That held up for a while, but with the spike in pricing, it puts the average transaction fee at around 5 cents of the US dollar. This latest patch would reduce it to half a cent.  There are two thresholds to meet when creating a bitcoin transaction and deciding what fee to charge, explains core developer Jeff Garzik. The first enables the network to relay your transaction, while the second persuades bitcoin miners to include your transaction in a block that they are mining. The first must occur before the second, so that the transaction gets to the miners in the first place.  ""In order to avoid spam, there is a hardcoded minimum, to avoid relaying transactions across the payment network that will never confirm (due to low fees or other reasons),"" said Garzik. ""This anti-spam minimum had not been adjusted since before the large price increase. Now, it's been adjusted.""  The change is still working its way through the development process, though, said Hearn.  ""It's what's currently in git master, although of course that's open to be changed any time before the final release of 0.9,"" he said.  Git is the online version control system used by the core developers to manage the various submissions to the code, and 'master' is the 'official' version, although this doesn't mean that it has actually been released .  ""Actually 0.9 should have been out already,"" Hearn continued. ""We went to a [release candidate] 1, but the recent malleability stuff means that it got delayed a bit I think.""  The one worry with lowering these hard-coded relay transaction fees is that it could open the door to denial of service attacks, in which people take advantage of very low transaction fees to flood the system with useless transactions designed to clog up the network. Gavin Andresen, who heads up the open source development team behind bitcoin, has explained that the 'dust' rule, which defines a minimum amount that can be sent over the network, is set by the transaction relay fee.  ""I really don't want to start playing whack-a-mole with spamming DoS attacks,"" said Andresen. One proposal to try and limit spam involves restructuring the bitcoin memory pool (this is the collective memory around the network, that holds bitcoin transactions that have been received but not yet confirmed).  ""I'd much rather get to a floating fee system with NO hard-coded relay fee rule sooner,"" Andresen has said. What he means is that ultimately, transaction fees won't be hard coded at all.  Garzik calls hard coded fees a bug, and a dynamic system of 'floating' transaction fees is preferable. In this scenario, the free market would decide both the relay limits and the block inclusion thresholds.  This is what smart fees are about. This enhancement to the bitcoin client would see both relay and mining fees handled dynamically, said Garzik. Only transactions likely to be confirmed in the blockchain within 48 hours would be relayed.  Smart fees aren't yet complete, though, so for now, lowering the transaction fees is a way to make it cheaper to relay transactions. Let's just hope it doesn't create a deluge of crud along the way.
