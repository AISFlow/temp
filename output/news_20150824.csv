42426458,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJsx3h,1440445512,Alleged Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme Organizers Arrested in Taiwan,"Authorities in Taiwan have reportedly arrested two individuals in connection with MyCoin, an alleged Ponzi scheme targeting bitcoin users.  News service China Times reports that Taipei's Criminal Investigation Bureau announced on 20th August that Lu Kuan-wei and Chen Yun-fei were apprehended and charged with their involvement in the scam. Lu and Chen reportedly held a number of MyCoin-related events.  The scam  resulted in millions of dollars in losses in various Asian countries. Victims were duped into investing in the bitcoin investment platform, which promised outsized returns.  The China Times report noted:  ""Chen and Lu held several events for investors convincing each one to spend NT$1.62 million (US$49,600) for 90 BTC and an account with MyCoin's parent company, which would distribute 0.63 of a bitcoin every day for a total value of NT$11,000 (US$337). The investors were told that their investment would be returned to them after just four and a half months.""  Taiwanese authorities have been conducting a formal investigation into MyCoin since March, according to the report.  Five individuals were arrested in Hong Kong in March, and law enforcement agencies in other nations have since pursued investigations into the matter.

42426456,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJswxh,1440438357,Bitcoin Price Slumps Following Bitfinex Outage,"The price of bitcoin slumped again today after Bitfinex closed its order book, citing issues with its post-trade processing.  The Hong Kong-based exchange, which witnessed a 'flash crash' just last week, halted trading for a seven-hour period this morning. The Bitfinex price promptly fell a further 3.8% when it reopened at 12:31pm UTC.  In a statement on Reddit, Zane Tackett, Bitfinex's director of community and product development, said:  ""Earlier today, at 5:27 UTC, we encountered an issue with post-trade processing, upon which we decided to halt trading to ensure consistency in the order book.""  Users were given a 15-minute window to cancel their orders before trading restarted. Many expressed frustration with the beta service, which has been plagued by technical glitches that Bitfinex's Phil Potter attributed to its transition to AlphaPoint software.  According to Bitcoinity data, the exchange handled 22,400 trades today, down from 81,500 this time last week. Since the flash crash, it has been shunted to the fourth most popular exchange, succeeded by Huobi and BTC China.  Last week's flash crash at Bitfinex saw the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index fall 14% to a four-month low of $214.03. At press time, it remains $30 below pre-flash crash levels.  Besides Bitfinex, a bitcoin market maker told CoinDesk the slump could also be due to the uncertainty around Bitcoin XT – the contentious client aiming to 'fork' bitcoin. He said:  ""Brittle markets as evidenced by Bitfinex's downtime today, coupled with overhang from the block size debate, mean a lot of people don't want to be the last ones to be able to sell.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/08/24/bitcoin-price-slumps-following-bitfinex-outage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bb05c5d66646c1d55dd87c5ef698e06801b2635-1500x687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426459,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJsxDh,1440437192,BTCS Reports $4.5 Million Net Loss as Mining Revenue Grows,"Bitcoin mining and consumer services firm BTCS Inc (formerly Bitcoin Shop) lost more money than it made the first half of this year.  The Nevada company reported a net loss of $4.59m for the first half of 2015 in its 10-Q filing with the SEC. The loss represented an increase over the roughly $4m loss incurred over the same period in 2014.  The change seems to have been driven largely by rise in non-operational costs, which rose from $205,000 to $791,000. In interview, however, CEO Charles Allen suggested that he views the report as a validation of BTCS' recent market strategy shift.  Allen stated that he views BTCS' pivot from e-commerce to transaction processing services as a success that will continue to benefit investors, telling CoinDesk:  ""We had 2,000% revenue growth. We went from $45,000 in revenue to $145,000 in revenue [quarter over quarter]. We're seeing tremendous growth on the transaction verification services side.""  In particular, Allen cited the fact that BTCS is now spending $109 on average to mine 1 BTC, worth roughly $220 at press time. He indicated he expects this cost to lower as BTCS nears opening new North Carolina-based mining facilities.  Other numbers showed similar improvements as operational losses narrowed between the two periods. The company reported $3.8m in operational losses for the first half of 2015, compared to $4.2m the year prior.  BTCS further recorded a second quarter net loss of about $1.25m, a drop by half compared to the second quarter of 2014 when it posted a second quarter net loss of $2.59m. Second quarter expenditures for 2015 were $2.05m compared to $2.66m the year before.  In a note, however, BTCS indicated that it ""expects to incur losses into the foreseeable future"". As of 30th June, the company had roughly $300,000 in cash on the books, as well as $46,100 in digital currency.  At press time, BTCS stock was trading at $0.13 a share.  Additional reporting by Stan Higgins.

42426468,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJsxNh,1440431802,Bitcoin Payments Make Debut at Mexican University,"A coffee shop located on the campus of Mexico's Universidad de las Américas Puebla (UDLAP) is now accepting bitcoin for purchases.  With the announcement, the 8,000-student university becomes the latest to host opportunities for young people to use and learn about the emerging technology.  While the first in the Latin American region, UDLAP joins Canada's Simon Fraser University (SFU), Spain's Pompeu Fabra University and MIT in the US on the list of colleges that host bitcoin ATMs or accept bitcoin for payment in school stores.  The bitcoin processing integration was provided by Latin American-focused bitcoin exchange provider Bitso, which recently raised an undisclosed seed round led by Digital Currency Group and launched a payment processing service, BitsoPagos.  The company expressed its belief that by accepting bitcoin payments, the Café Punta del Cielo location will expose more students to the technology while potentially encouraging other local franchises to accept the payment option.  Jose Rodriguez, VP of payments of Bitso, said in a statement:  ""We expect this successful BitsoPagos integration to create the traction for more Punta del Cielo and many other merchants to adopt Bitcoin.”  Founded in 2004, Café Punta del Cielo specializes in the distribution and sale of coffee produced in Mexico. As of 2012, it operated more than 100 franchises in Mexico with additional locations in Hong Kong, Spain and the US.

LakeBTC  users can deposit GBP via a UK bank transfer, while JPY deposits can be made via a Japanese domestic bank transfer.

The college's new course, Crypto Currencies: Bitcoin and Friends, launches on 21st September. Besides Stanford students, it will be open to professionals completing their graduate certificate in cyber security.  Computer Science professor Dan Boneh, an expert in applied cryptography, will lead the course – which tackles security across the entire bitcoin ecosystem. In a release he said:  ""The technology behind bitcoin and other crypto currencies can be an indispensable tool for protecting information.""  While the introductory webinar is free, tuition for the remainder of the sessions clocks in at $3,960 (a $600 discount for attendees from one of Stanford's member organisations). To complete the certificate, which requires four modules in total, will cost between $13,440 and $18,480.  Founded in 1885, Stanford frequently ranks in the top five universities in the US, only 5.7% applicants who apply are accepted.

42426472,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJsxVh,1440408000,Top Mainstream Media Bitcoin Fails,"When it comes to bitcoin, it would be fair to say that the mainstream media does have a tendency to get things wrong.  Although coverage has improved since the early days, as some journalists are beginning to take the digital currency and its underlying technology more seriously, mistakes continue to crop up.  Ranging from hugely inaccurate to outrageously funny, here are some of the biggest mainstream media fails to date.  1. Hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto  The mainstream press has joined the pursuit to identify Satoshi Nakamoto, the person or group of people credited with creating bitcoin.  Back in 2014, Newsweek thought it had found the real Satoshi – Dorian Nakamoto, an unassuming and unemployed engineer with apparently no background in cryptography.  He denied he was the real creator of bitcoin soon after the story was published. Despite this, Newsweek and author Leah McGrath did not issue an apology, instead they re-emphasised their assumptions in a statement, which noted ""the facts as reported point toward Mr Nakamoto's role in the founding of Bitcoin"".  At the time, Nakamoto and his lawyer publicly said they would like to sue the publication but required more funds to do. In an attempt to raise money, the duo created website called 'Newsweek Lied', which featured a photo of Dorian Nakamoto holding a sign saying ""Newsweek's article hurt my family"".  Speaking to  Ars Technica, Nakamoto's lawyer Ethan Kirschner said:  ""Goodman showed up at his house, scared his elderly mother, obtained his e-mail address by deception, and misquoted or invented quotes from both him and his brothers. They published his health, financial, and employment history recklessly. They need to account for what they did.""  Doran is not the only person to have been named as bitcoin's mysterious creator (or creators) in the past.  At the end of 2013, blogger Skye Grey linked Nick Szabo to bitcoin's white paper using stylometric analysis – the study of linguistic style, usually used to attribute authorship to anonymous or disputed documents.  Hal Finney, a cryptography pioneer and the first person (aside from Satoshi) to use the bitcoin protocol has also been linked with Satoshi.  2. Bitcoin CEO  Following on from the general misunderstanding – or confusion – that bitcoin is a company and not a peer-to-peer decentralised network, last March saw the emergence of reports which ran a headline noting Bitcoin's CEO had tragically died in a suspected suicide. The victim, was in fact Autumn Radtke, the CEO of in-game currency trading platform First Metahttps://firstmetaexchange.com/currencyshop/index.  However, Radtke was not the first 'Bitcoin CEO' to be mentioned in the media. Steve Beauregard, CEO of bitcoin payment processor GoCoin was also mistakenly dubbed bitcoin CEO by a journalist from the Santa Monica Mirror.  More recently, Yahoo News referred to Mark Karpeles, the CEO of failed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, as ""Bitcoin CEO"".  3. Bitcoin bowl no more  ""The Bitcoin Bowl is no more"" began an article by CBS Sports earlier this year, before continuing to note that ""bitcoin was dropping out of its sponsorship deal with the bowl in St. Petersburg Florida after only one year"".  Bitcoin, however, cannot pull out from any kind of social engagement as it is not an entity, nor is it – as many would have you believe – a company.  The article was alluding to the fact that bitcoin payment processor BitPay had agreed to drop its sponsorship deal for the college football play-off.  4. Bitcoin is dead    If the headlines are to be believed, bitcoin has died a few times during its relatively short history.  Always a controversial topic, journalists have, rather prematurely, predicted the digital currency's death on various occasions – with some accounts reading like true bitcoin obituaries.  The cryptocurrency has undeniably had its ups and downs but the media has perhaps focused too heavily on its volatility.  Whether it's down to the media's misunderstanding or the speed at which news is relayed nowadays, it is fair to say that some mistakes have provided hours of entertainment among the crypto community, whilst others have angered bitcoin enthusiasts, who have always jumped to the digital currency's defence.
