However, the regulator is still analyzing how best to regulate ICOs which do not fall within that bucket.  He told the committee:  ""The subsequent question is what do we do with those ICOs that are outside the regulatory world. We will assess that as a board. We expect to report by the end of the year.""  The news comes less than a week after ESMA revealed it was budgeting more than €1 million to monitor cryptocurrencies and other fintech activities next year.  As previously reported, the agency's 2019 Annual Work Programme set aside €1.1 million for activities revolving around financial innovation, including crypto assets.  At the time, the document stated that ESMA's objective over the upcoming year was to ""achieve a coordinated approach to the regulation and supervisory treatment of new or innovative financial activities.""

The Regulators' Pioneer Fund announced on Friday that it would award nearly £700,000 (just under $915,000) to Ofcom, the national telecommunications regulatory authority, ""for a project that uses blockchain technology to improve U.K. telephone number management.""  Ofcom provided more details about the project Monday, saying in a press release that there are roughly 1 billion phone numbers available to U.K. residents, ""either already in use or reserved for allocation.""  ""We issue blocks of these numbers to telecoms operators, who manage the numbers and movement (porting) of them into and out of their control,"" it explained.  However, as the country moves from traditional analog phone lines to an internet-based infrastructure, current systems may face issues. As such, blockchain technology could be used to lower costs, make porting more efficient, streamline fraud or ""nuisance"" call management and provide customers with a better experience.  Ofcom chief technology officer Mansoor Hanif said in a statement that the regulator would work with industry members, explaining:  ""We will be working with industry to explore how blockchain could make it quicker and easier for landline customers to switch providers while keeping their number – as well as reducing nuisance calls. And we'll expand our research into other areas where innovative technologies such as blockchain could be applied to benefit consumers.""  The entity has been looking to develop a new database to create these improvements, but past attempts have failed, the release explained.  In particular, centralized databases are expensive and put up ""barriers to collaboration,"" but a blockchain platform ""offers an opportunity to build a cost-effective and future-proof solution.""

Announced Tuesday, the Oasis Startup Hub will focus on aiding firms building ""privacy-first computing on blockchain"" platforms, according to a press release. Accel, a16z crypto, Binance Labs, Pantera Capital and Polychain Capital will all provide support for the program.  As structured, the hub will offer developers access to technical support and early access to new technology, as well as assistance and feedback from investors.  Program members will further have the opportunity to work directly with investors and Oasis Labs engineers through working sessions, office hours and private events, the release indicates.  In a statement, CEO Dawn Song explained that, ""we've seen strong interest in our private testnet from companies and developers who want to build scalable applications that protect user data and put privacy first – and are constrained by existing platforms.""  As such, Song added:  ""We're encouraged by the diversity and volume of application developers who share our values and validate our approach. We designed the Oasis Startup Hub to bring experts together for invaluable interactions around how to design, build and deliver exciting new applications.""  Oasis Labs already has several launch clients for the hub, which, while it did not name them in the release, are already working on applications that ""require strong privacy protections.""  At present, these applications include areas like decentralized credit scoring and distributed data marketplaces for artificial intelligence, though other startups can still apply to join the hub.  Applications focusing on data protection will continue to gain importance, Accel partner Jake Flomenberg said in the release, noting the recent string of ""high-profile privacy failures.""  Similarly, Pantera Capital partner Paul Veradittakit commented that the hub ""offers a unique opportunity"" for funds ""to share expertise and relationships to solve key issues around blockchain scalability and privacy, and move toward widespread adoption.""

Intended for introduction in 2019, the new rules would allow firms to raise capital via crypto token sales as an alternative to traditional methods such as IPOs, according to a Reuters report published Monday.  The news was revealed by the head of the U.A.E.'s securities watchdog, Obaid Saif al-Zaabi, who said at a seminar today:  ""The board of the Emirates Securities & Commodities Authority has approved considering ICOs as securities. As per our plan we should have regulations on the ground in the first half of 2019.""  Draft rules covering ICOs are already being drawn up by the regulator in conjunction with advisers from outside of the country, Zaabi said, adding that it is also working with stock markets in Abu Dhabi and Dubai to prepare trading platforms for the new digital assets.  Reuters indicates that a double-whammy of low oil prices and lackluster equities markets in recent years have dampened IPO activity in the U.A.E. and across neighboring nations.  As well as providing a legal basis for ICOs, the country may also draw up a new law to boost the number of IPOs by allowing family owners sell up to 100 percent of firms under their control. The measure is currently awaiting approval from the prime minister's office, Zaabi indicated.  If and when the new ICO regulations come into law, the move would mark the U.A.E. as one of the countries in the world to have brought in a regulatory framework for the blockchain funding method.  Malta, for one, recently passed several bills to provide a legal basis for ICOs, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology earlier this year as part of its plan to become a ""Blockchain Island.""  The island nation's prime minister recently said in a U.N. speech that cryptocurrency is the ""inevitable future of money.""  Bermuda, too, is hoping to attract more businesses to the island by providing legislation that would allow initial coin offerings under certain conditions.

42429781,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1IJh,1539001858,Venezuelans Forced to Use Petro Cryptocurrency to Pay for Passports,"Venezuelans are now being forced to pay for passports with the country's controversial petro cryptocurrency, a report indicates.  According to Bloomberg, Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said in a press conference on Friday that a new passport will cost citizens two petros, an amount worth 7,200 bolivars.  With that amount being four times the minimum monthly wage, Venezuelans face an even harder task obtaining their travel documents as they seek to flee the country's economic and humanitarian crisis, the news source indicates.  With the nation having also just announced the establishment of a police force specifically to tackle migration, as Finance Magnates reports, the insistence on petro payments for passports and the increased price point seem aimed to stem the tide of people seeking to flee Venezuela.  Despite arriving in pre-sale in February, the oil and mineral-backed crypto token was formally launched by President Maduro last week.  In a tweet, he stated (via translation):  ""Welcome to Petro! It came to strengthen the economic recovery program and to revolutionize the global cryptoeconomy as a new form of commercial, financial and monetary exchange.""  Maduro has also pegged the revamped national currency, the sovereign bolivar, to the petro, as reported by CoinDesk.  However, with the token being openly used to flout U.S.-led sanctions against the country, President Trump moved to block its use in commerce with new restrictions in March.  Just last week, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators even pushed for tighter sanctions against the petro, calling for a ban on U.S. residents providing ""software"" to the Venezuelan government as part of its efforts to utilize the petro.  Seemingly placing all his hopes in the success of the token, Maduro has been making a major drive to force institutions to use the petro. In late August, he ordered banks to adopt the petro, having forced companies to do the same back in March. The nation must also peg pension and salary systems to the cryptocurrency, as was declared in August.

42429797,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Iph,1538998209,IBM's Food Blockchain Is Going Live With a Supermarket Giant on Board,"IBM is taking its food-tracking blockchain into production, making it one of the largest enterprise projects to achieve that milestone, and has signed European supermarket giant Carrefour to use it.  Announced Monday, the commercial launch of IBM Food Trust means that large players, as well as small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in the food industry supply chain, can now join the network for a subscription fee ranging from $100 to $10,000 a month.  And many SMEs may have a stronger incentive to participate now that Carrefour, which operates 12,000 stores in 33 countries, is on board. The retailer will track and trace its own branded products in France, Spain and Brazil, before expanding to other countries by 2022.  ""For us, it's a matter of sense for the consumer,"" Emmanuel Delerm, blockchain program director at Carrefour, told CoinDesk. ""It's really this that will push us to say to our producers or partners or suppliers, will they come on the platform? It's really consumer-orientated; it's really for them that we are doing this.""  Yet Carrefour is only the latest food company with supply chain clout to sign up for IBM Food Trust. Others include Nestle, Dole Food, Tyson Foods, Kroger, Unilever – and not least of all the U.S. big-box behemoth Walmart. Notably, Walmart has already flexed its muscle, telling leafy-greens suppliers last month that they must integrate with the network by September 2019 and citing an e.coli outbreak as an urgent reason to improve transparency.  Describing the fruits of more than a year's work, Ramesh Gopinath, IBM's vice president of blockchain solutions, told CoinDesk,  ""IBM Food Trust is the first production blockchain at real scale and we are super-excited to finally be making the product available broadly.""  Indeed, the one other enterprise blockchain of comparable heft to go live is we.trade, the trade finance consortium of 12 global banks, which entered production in late June.  The mainstay of the IBM Food Trust commercial offering, explained Gopinath, is the ability to trace items backward and forward through the supply chain. This means the apples in a brand of baby food, for example, can be pinpointed back to a particular batch and orchard; then, in the event of, say, contamination, the trace can go forward to recall the whole range of products that might be affected.  ""That obviously requires the growers, the suppliers, and the retailers all to be part of the solution, sending in information in a trusted and permissioned fashion and we link it all together,"" said Gopinath.  So far, 3 million transactions have been processed on the ledger during 18 months of testing, and now that it's gone live, Gopinath is confident that ""if anything it will be ten times faster.""  Top of the food chain?  IBM Food Trust is without doubt leading the track-and-trace food space. The network was built using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain protocol (which Big Blue contributed to the Hyperledger project). But there will likely be others in the race, including some which may also emerge from within the Hyperledger commmunity.  Also gathering momentum is Sawtooth, the codebase donated to Hyperledger by Intel. Indeed, if you take the time to inspect the Sawtooth Supply Chain GitHub repository, in July of this year there were 15 code commits from U.S. food giant Cargill, involving some kind of track and trace project; the word ""fish"" is mentioned. Asked if a proof of concept was forthcoming on Sawtooth, Cargill declined to comment.  But in any case, IBM's Gopinath was sanguine about other Fortune 100 companies working on possible solutions, adding that interoperability is an ultimate goal.  ""All of that, in my view, is good news,"" he said. ""It's affirmation that path we started on three plus years ago is the right one. And back when we started out, we have always had interoperability in mind.""  He also pointed to data sharing standards like GS1 which means the necessary work will be done up front. Gopinath added,  ""I'd love it if IBM Food Trust was the only platform out there for this, but we are not that naive. If there's another one that is as good and as mature as Food Trust out there then absolutely we will be happy to do the interop.""  Chicken and egg  Carrefour's Delerm said the supermarket chain worked on its own blockchain for more than a year, mainly using internal engineer teams, before switching to IBM's.  ""Being a retailer we knew that IBM was working with Walmart on IBM Food Trust in the U.S. primarily,"" he said.  As such, Carrefour saw scope to widen the range of products it was already working on, such as the way it currently verifies production of free-range chicken in the Auvergne region in central France.  ""As of today, we have three products in France that since the start of the year we have been delivering to consumers all the information: tomatoes, chicken and eggs, and we added recently the chicken also in Italy,"" said Delerm.  In addition to the existing Carrefour Quality Lines live on the blockchain, the plan is to use IBM Food Trust to include international brands, said Delerm, such as some of those already working with Food Trust like Nestle and Unilever, as well as exploring organic produce-tracking.  Growing adoption  Also joining Food Trust on Monday are the cooperative Topco Associates representing 15,000 stores; retailer-owned cooperative Wakefern, representing 50 member companies and 344 stores; as well as suppliers including Beefchain, Dennick Fruit Source and Smithfield.  Food Trust can also be accessed by way of a module that simply allows firms to upload data about goods to the system, done via the cloud or another app, and which is free of charge. A more advanced version of this involves certificates, organic or Fair Trade credentials and so on.  Stepping back, Food Trust is one of IBM's main blockchain buckets; another is shipping and global trade, and in this area, the flagship platform is IBM's collaboration with Maersk, dubbed TradeLens.  So far, TradeLens is yet to onboard any other carriers that are anything like the size of Maersk. So, could it be that the food industry is an easier ride in terms of adoption, or perhaps it's an area where the benefits are more immediately tangible?  Gopinath pointed that Food Trust has been some 18 months in the making, and that progress is being made on TradeLens to scale up to the same degree among parties that normally compete with each other.  He concluded:  ""IBM Food Trust is making this big announcement; similarly, TradeLens will also have a commercial availability announcement. And at that point, I can guarantee you it will be in the same shape we are in here.""

42429802,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Ith,1538997325,Bitcoin's Price Volatility Just Hit Another 15-Month Low,"Bitcoin price volatility continues to drop, with one measure having reached a 15-month low.  Weekly volatility, as calculated by the difference between the high and low, fell to $317 last week – the lowest reading since the first week of July 2017 – according to Bitfinex data.  More importantly, the leading cryptocurrency witnessed a trading range of $498 and $741 in the previous two weeks, respectively. The data indicate that BTC is being squeezed in an ever-narrowing price range and, as per technical rules, a decisive move is overdue.  Other measures of bitcoin price volatility are also echoing similar sentiments. For instance, Bollinger bandwidth reading fell to the lowest level since December 2016 last week.  The lifeless trading pattern suggests both bulls and the bears continue to remain on the sidelines, offering very little directional bias to the cryptocurrency.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,600 on Bitfinex, representing just 0.15 percent gain on a 24-hour basis and a 0.40 percent rise on a weekly basis.  Weekly chart  BTC defended $6,100 and created a bullish outside reversal in the third week of September, as seen in the weekly chart. However, the follow-through has been anything but encouraging.  Notably, the cryptocurrency created a doji candle last week, signaling indecision in the marketplace. The odds of a big bullish move would rise if BTC finds acceptance above the last week's high of $6,741. On the other hand, a move below the last week's low of $6,424 may embolden the bears.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, the lateral trading has brought BTC closer to falling trendline sloping downwards from July highs.  The bearish trendline would be breached if BTC continues to move sideways in the next 48 hours, however, the sideways breach of the falling trendline does not qualify as a breakout, as per technical analysis theory.  Only a convincing upside move above the trendline hurdle would confirm a bullish breakout.  The daily chart also shows that the choppiness index has dropped below the 61.8 percent level, indicating BTC could be in the early stages of a big bullish or bearish move.  View  The last week's high of $6,741 and low of $6,424 are key levels to watch out for this week.  BTC is closing on a long overdue range breakout, according to choppiness index.  A break below $6,424 could yield a quick-fire drop to the psychological support of $6,000.  A move above $6,741 would allow a sustained break above $7,000.

Called CertiK, the firm seeks to help secure smart contract and blockchain platforms through a formal verification process. The team has already begun working on ensuring existing blockchain platforms do not contain bugs that could lead to a loss of funds or other vulnerabilities, according to a press release.  The company was founded last year, in part by Yale professor Zhong Shao, who is known for developing a ""certified operating system"" called CertiKOS, and Columbia University assistant professor Ronghui Gu.  CertiK's team operates by applying mathematical proofs to networks to determine whether hackers can breach the systems.  The team's methods include ""a layer-based decomposition approach, pluggable proof engines, machine-checkable proof objects, certified [decentralized application] libraries and smart labeling,"" according to the release. By using these approaches, the researchers claim they can then confirm a blockchain platform's security in an objective manner.  While Binance Labs did not disclose the total amount of the investment, a spokesperson told CoinDesk that its stake accounted for ""multiple millions"" of dollars.  The incubator's CEO, Ella Zhang, said in the release that CertiK's platform addresses at least one outstanding need in the blockchain space, explaining:  ""CertiK mathematically validates the security of smart contracts, which is a critical pain point we are facing in the blockchain ecosystem, bypassing the limitations of manual detection.""  The investment ""signals the recognition of the importance of formal verification in the blockchain industry,"" the statement went on to say. CertiK in particular comes with a ""unique advantage"" in the field given its history and proven technology.  This technology includes CertiKOS, which has already been used in both enterprise and military programs, and is one of the tools used by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the release notes.

According to a company blog post published Monday, token projects seeking to be listed on the exchange will continue to be allowed to propose their own listing fees. The exchange will neither dictate such fees nor impose a minimum pricing level, the post indicates.  Notably, Binance said it will donate 100 percent of listing fees to its recently launched charity division, the Blockchain Charity Foundation.  In an email to CoinDesk, the exchange added that all the listing fees, that are now effectively donations, will be published on foundation's website, in a move to increase transparency in the listing process.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated in the post that the donation amount is down to the projects themselves and the size does not ""guarantee or in any way influence the outcome"" of the exchange's listing review process.    The exchange's charity arm was launched in July to put al least some of its billions of dollars in profits into charity initiatives. The foundation is chaired by Helen Hai, a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.    Today's policy shift also follows recent debate over the murky area of the fees charged by exchanges to list crypto tokens, which are generally not declared.

In August, a crypto project CEO claimed on Twitter that Binance had quoted 400 bitcoin in an email as a fee for listing the firm's asset in August. But Zhao later denied the claim, saying Binance never quoted fees via email.  He went on to state at the time: ""We don't list shitcoins even if they pay 400 or 4,000 BTC. ...

The Medium article also referred to a Bloomberg report last Tuesday as supporting evidence that the Puerto Rican Noble Bank is now mulling a sale and has stopped offering its banking services to both Bitfinex and Tether.  On that front, the exchange said information and accusations surrounding Noble Bank has ""no impact"" on its ""operations, survivability, or solvency.""  The news comes as the latest controversy surrounding Bitfinex as one of the longest-running crypto exchanges. In January, both Bitfinex and Tether were reportedly subpoenaed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Months later, amid complaints over lack of transparency, the company published a report – via a law firm, instead of an auditing firm – which claimed the company had $2.55 billion in U.S. dollar reserves to back $2.54 billion-worth of USDT that were circulating on June 1.  However, as CoinDesk pointed out after reviewing the document, it only covered one point in time and did not provide proof of its level of collateralization for other periods.

42429760,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1Dph,1538985605,Messaging Giant Kakao Launches Its Own Blockchain for Testing,"Ground X, the blockchain development arm of the South Korean messaging giant Kakao, has launched a test network (testnet) of its proprietary blockchain network dubbed Klaytn.  The firm said in a press release on Monday that the testnet is now made available to 10 invited partners on the network. It has also published a white paper offering details of the platform, which seeks to lay the technological foundation for decentralized applications or dapps.  According to the white paper, the Klaytn blockchain takes a hybrid approach that adopts the concepts of consensus nodes (CNs) and ranger nodes (RNs) to achieve both scalability and transparency.  CNs are invited partners on the network that together form a private blockchain to batch and confirm transactions by running a byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm, according to the white paper. Meanwhile, anyone from the public can connect to the network and participate as a RN, whose duty is to double check blocks that have been propagated by the CNs.  ""Ranger nodes (RNs) download newly created blocks from the CNs and periodically communicate ('gossip') among themselves while storing a local copy of the blockchain. They validate the new blocks chosen by the CNs and check that the CNs never equivocate on the content of a given block height. Anybody can join the network as an RN,"" Ground X wrote in the paper.  Via this hybrid approach, Ground X claims the block propagation interval in the testnet has been reduced to less than one per second and offers throughput of up to 1,500 transactions per second.  To incentivize participation, the network will proportionally distribute 10 billion ""KLAY "" tokens to both types of nodes based on their contribution, though an exact ratio has not been announced so far. The network is expected to issue additional tokens every year as block rewards.  Ground X added that it will publish the network's source code to the public at a later stage and the Klaytn full live network (or mainnet) will launch in the first quarter of 2019. At press time, the company had not responded to a CoinDesk enquiry on whether the KLAY token will be tradable on exchages when the network is official live.  The testnet launch comes roughly six months after Kakao revealed its plan to move into the blockchain space.  As CoinDesk previously reported, the firm confirmed the creation of Ground X in March and said at the time that the envisioned blockchain network will also be integrated with Kakao's existing internet offerings such as Kakao Talk messaging app.    Kakao Talk image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,KLAY,BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED | KLAY,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/10/08/messaging-giant-kakao-launches-its-own-blockchain-for-testing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/635bdb4fa6f710ffdaf57b20affbdded3f57e77d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a speech during his visit to Zurich, Park announced last week that his Blockchain Urban Plan for 2018–2022 will cover 14 public services in five areas, with a government budget totaling 123.3 billion Korean won (around $108 million), according to a CoinDesk Korea report on Thursday.  Park added that major public services that will adopt blockchain include labor welfare, vehicle history management, certification issuance, donation management and elections voting.  The mayor explained, for instance, the Seoul Metropolitan Government will use the technology to protect part-time workers who don't have labor contracts or are not covered by employment insurance.  These workers will be able to register via a blockchain application that will be developed as part of the plan. After that, labor welfare organizations and insurance companies, which participate as running nodes, could share workers' information over a distributed network and decide on insurance schemes, the report said.  Park also indicated his administration aims to spend another 60 billion won, or about $53 million, building two complexes by 2021 to house 200 blockchain startups by utilizing parts of the Gaepo Digital Innovation Park and Mapo Seoul Startup Hub.  The plan comes just months after Park won the re-election campaign as Seoul's mayor in June. As CoinDesk previously reported, Park pledged as part of his campaign at the time that he would increase support for blockchain development in Seoul by developing the city's Mapo district as a center for blockchain incubation.  Seoul's blockchain effort is also in line with the roadmap announced by South Korea's Ministry of ICT, which said in June it would invest $9 million in the coming years to lead blockchain adoption in six major public services.

42429770,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1E5h,1538967688,Good Money's Master Plan: A Stealth Bid to Get Celebrities Promoting Crypto,"UPDATE 8 October 20:22 UTC: After publication, this story was updated with additional comment from Good Money.  Can flat abs gurus and mommy bloggers sell the masses on crypto?  That seems to be the master plan behind a much-hyped stealth startup by Gunnar Lovelace, the former co-founder of Thrive Market, who plans to redeploy a network of ""mega-bloggers"" he built up promoting the health marketplace by turning its legion of fitness fans onto crypto.  But if Lovelace is open to touting a network of celebrities that includes movie stars, life coaches, cookbook authors and U2 frontman Bono in private, his company has been anything but public since its 2018 founding. Not only does its website contain virtually no information, but talk of the project has only so far seemed to circulate around secret parties strategically placed at major crypto events.  Yet, investor documents obtained by CoinDesk reveal what Good Money is really banking on, the idea millennials trust internet personalities more than media or financial institutions. Thus, the central idea is those personalities might be more than willing to monetize that trust.  A pitch deck for the company obtained by CoinDesk explains:  ""Good Money is a millennial mobile-first banking platform with a fiat-crypto interoperability that empowers global citizens to be part of a more equitable and transparent world.""  Rumored to be planning a major initial coin offering (ICO) since early 2018, Austin-based Good Money has raised $22 million on an offered $40 million in what appears to be a convertible note according to a September SEC filing.  As for the product, it's effectively a mobile crypto wallet that will double as bank, payment system and investment platform (among other things). It also promises to let users decide which socially good causes to devote company profits to.  Many of Good Money's promises will sound familiar to regular readers of initial coin offering (ICO) white papers – fast transactions! low fees! amazing user experience! – but one aspect of Good Money does stand out: its focus on marketing. In a document outlining Good Money's ""Token Ecosystem,"" it describes a fundraising plan that ultimately aims to raise $80 million selling GDMY security tokens, or ""Good Shares,"" tokenized equity in the company.  Lovelace, company's CEO, told CoinDesk it now says it does not have a stated goal for the fundraising.  The general public can look forward to a $15 million coin offering (though the token price is to be determined). The founders put in $10 million at a $40 million valuation, or $0.0024 per token. The next tranches were slightly higher, in investor documents, but the company now says all outside capital was raised at the founders' valuation.  That document breaks down a simple budget for the funds, and marketing is the largest clearly defined line item, with $15-30 million earmarked for marketing as opposed to $7-10 million for opening relationships with banks and $8-10 million devoted to technology.  But if talk of the company has largely circulated around parties, the documents suggest this isn't likely to stop. ""Good Money Festivals"" are one of the six legs of its larger marketing plan, and one of five co-founders is a long-time Burning Man staff member.  The key: influencers  Should Good Money continue to raise capital, it appears its plan is to rely heavily on an aggressive social media strategy.  The documents explain that influencers were key to Thrive Market's ability to attract millennial customers, arguing it was ""mega-bloggers"" who became investors in Thrive and promoted its products to their following.  Several internet personalities can be seen throughout Good Money's various investor documents: Zoe Saldana (Guardians of the Galaxy), Wellness Mama (blogger), Mike Geary (TruthAboutAbs.com), Nick Ortner (author) and Michelle Tam (paleo cookbook author).  None of the documents indicate that any of these influencers have committed to Good Money. (They are only listed as suggested supporters based on prior involvement with Lovelace in Thrive.)  A TechCrunch story on Thrive from 2016 lists several celebrity investors, including Saldana, Michaels, John Legend (musician), Jillian Michaels (The Biggest Loser), Deepak Chopra (author) and Tony Robbins (author).  Its funds for influencers and publishers won't stop with the money it raises in the token sale. Provided the GDMY token holds its value, one-third of the reserve released every year will be used to bring them on board and keep them. Thrive Market promised people and organizations with reach equity for each customer converted, and Good Money proposes to import that same model.  In a rare talk given at the World Blockchain Forum earlier this year, Lovelace explained:  ""We come into the crypto market with an army of influencers and publishers and celebrities that will bring more marketing firepower to the launch of good money and the scaling of our platform than any other cryptocurrency has to date.""  Two-token system  But if the marketing strategy is big on strategy and short on details, so, too, are the technical promises.  Good Money plans to offer two tokens, both of which will be held by its user custodial wallet, which Lovelace called a ""core beachhead"" for the company. Though it's not clear yet which blockchain they will run on, its ""litepaper"" says it will scale by ""either forking or running on top of platforms such as EOS, Hashgraph, NEO, Polkadot, etc.""  It continues: ""Good Money APIs will interact with an abstraction layer that allows us to toggle between the chosen underlying blockchain.""  ""We've done a lot of analysis. We see a lot of use cases for stablecoins,"" Lovelace told CoinDesk. ""We're really studying, and we're not committed in our day one rollout.""  Though an investor deck showed a projected release date of September 2019, for its stablecoin called GOODS. It said each GOODS token will be worth exactly $1, though various documents indicate there might be conflicting stablecoin strategies (one says it will be 100 percent collateralized and backed by US dollars, and another says it's weighing options for the optimal mixed collateralized and algorithmic approach).  A stablecoin is not ""fully confirmed,"" according to a spokesperson, who wrote, ""it will not be a utility or a consumer token.""  Ultimately, investor documents said that 100 billion GDMY security tokens will be minted, split equally in two pools, one for investors and the team behind Good Money. For the founders, team and advisors, 30.31 percent of this pool has been set aside. The rest is for investors.  Good Money now says this information is outdated, adding: ""All decisions regarding the number of authorized token, the number of issued token and the allocation among various constituents of the company will be determined by company leadership.""  The second pool will be released continuously over a 16-year period in order to cover the costs of incentives, marketing and operations. Provided the token holds its value, the documents suggest this will be how it can promise no fee banking to consumers, because costs will be covered by the release of these tokens.  Due to regulatory uncertainty, there's no current estimate when GDMY tokens will begin trading, according to Lovelace, though investor documents seen by CoinDesk had stated that GDMY should begin trading on January 1.  Consumers will also earn GDMY tokens for being good customers, which will give them votes over which causes profits will support and an ownership stake in their mobile bank. These will presumably be funded by annual reserve emissions.  Additionally, documents promised customers that use GOODS commercially will be rewarded with 4 to 8 percent cash back in GDMY. This is no longer part of the plan, according to Lovelace.  Critically, all profits made by Good Money (through merchant fees, exchange fees, future financial products and etc) will be split half and half. The first half will go to socially good causes voted on by the community.  The second half will go to increase the value of GDMY tokens over time through a buyback and burn program governed by a smart contract. These sorts of programs have become a familiar way for token projects to reassure investors of the potential for long term growth.  Good Money preserves decentralization, preventing itself or any third party from accessing users' keys. Instead, Good Money plans to allow users to recover lost passwords by authorizing multiple friends to attest to their identity to the blockchain in the event of a lost private key.  No surprise, the company views this strategy as a potential way to grow adoption.  Super Team  Elsewhere, Good Money could get support from an arguably experienced founding team.  Knowledgeable sources told CoinDesk that investors have been excited about the team behind Good Money because each member has a prior track record scaling businesses, either as founders or early employees.  One of the pitch decks obtained by CoinDesk lists several investors, including: BlockTower Capital, Multicoin Capital, Ken Howery (PayPal co-founder), Reeve Collins (Tether co-founder), Gil Penchina (Ridge Ventures) and Peter Diamandis (X Prize founder), among others.  Lovelace co-founded the aforementioned Thrive Markets, an e-commerce site for healthy foods and goods, and previously exited from Strategy Cognition and EGO-X Studios, according to AngelList.  Investor materials lists five other co-founders, including Nick Sullivan, whose bitcoin tipping company ChangeTip had its team acqui-hired by Airbnb in 2016. Sullivan was also employee number one at a company acquired by Salesforce for $840 million.  Andrew Masanto was an an early employee at Hedera Hashgraph, a distributed ledger technology company that announced a $100 million funding round in August. The Good Money team also includes Seth Taube, as an advisor, CEO of Medley Management, an alternative asset management firms that went public in 2014, currently with a $161 million market capitalization.  Lovelace said: ""One of my superpowers as a leader and entrepreneur is to identify great people."" Its a talent he thinks will be recognized by social influencers as well.  He continued:  ""Because I've made them so much money and have the credibility with them, they're coming into Good Money. They're excited. You know, it's literally like: where do I send a check? How do I get involved? When can I start promoting?""  Image of Gunnar Lovelace from YouTube  Correction 8 October 20:22 UTC: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified the company CEO.  UPDATE 8 October 15:30 UTC: After publication, Multicoin Capital told CoinDesk that it declined investing in Good Money, though it did ""seriously consider the deal,"" according to a spokesperson.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/10/08/good-moneys-master-plan-a-stealth-bid-to-get-celebrities-promoting-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7ecc3515fbca58fa8de5b9178fef346a729af82-2560x1649.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
