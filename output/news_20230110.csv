42413152,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7zs8,1673392958,Judge Allows Binance.US Bid to Buy Voyager Assets to Advance,"Bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital's proposed deal to sell some of its assets to Binance.US is a step closer to becoming reality.  U.S. District Judge Michael Wiles, of the bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York, during a hearing Tuesday afternoon approved disclosure statements explaining various aspects of the proposed plan to sell Voyager assets, but asked for attorneys working on the deal to revise the proposed order documents before he approves them. The deal, which will be the subject of another confirmation hearing in March, also needs approval from a majority of Voyager's creditors.  Voyager initially agreed to sell itself to FTX, but reopened the bidding process after Sam Bankman-Fried's exchange collapsed in November. Binance.US swooped in with the winning offer in December.  Joshua Sussborg, a Kirkland & Ellis attorney representing Voyager, said at the beginning of the hearing that moving forward with the deal with Binance.US would be in the best interests of Voyager's creditors.  ""We do not want to delay getting money, getting crypto back into our customers hands. Importantly ... we also took a very hard look at a standalone self-liquidation ... the self-liquidation auction is not an option that is going to put the most money in our customers pockets,"" Sussborg said.  The proposed deal is opposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), state regulators, the U.S. Trustee's office and private parties. The Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S. (CFIUS) also said it would review deals made by the lender, which filed for bankruptcy last year. The judge said the committee's issues are ""really non-issues for today,""  During the hearing, Kirkland & Ellis partner Christine Okike, also speaking on behalf of Voyager, said lawyers had ""resolved for the purposes of today"" objections made by the SEC and the state of New Jersey.  ""The debtors submit that we have performed due diligence on Binance.US, and Binance.US' financials show that it has ample cash on hand to pay the debtors up to $35 million in cash, the maximum amount that may be due,"" she said.

7371376,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515635,1673391637,Will Solana Price Continue To Surge After The Explosive Price Rally?,"The Solana price has secured 45% appreciation over the last week. The coin made this significant recovery after its yearly low of $8 in December. Over the last 24 hours, the coin fell by 1.6%, which depicted that SOL was consolidating after a period of an explosive rally. As Bitcoin continued to recover, major altcoins also noted northbound price action. The technical outlook for the coin has also pointed towards bullish strength mounting on the chart. Accumulation has been substantial, and demand for the coin has shot up over the last week. Related Reading: Despite A Relief Rally Polkadot Struggles Under $5, What’s Next? At the moment, the altcoin was inside the overbought zone, meaning buyers had taken over the market completely. After a rally, a coin usually faces a correction, and the Solana price might be heading in that direction. Continued consolidation for the coin will eventually cause Solana price to lose its immediate support line. The Solana price has to trade above the $17 price mark for the altcoin to continue its bullish trend over the long term. The market capitalization of Solana rose over the last 24 hours, which meant that bulls were in control as buyers outnumbered sellers at press time. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was exchanging hands at $16.45 at the time of writing. As the coin traveled above the $8 mark, it breached significant resistance levels. The $14 price level was the most significant of these resistance levels. Similarly, the $17 resistance mark is crucial for the Solana price to continue trading upwards. Since the coin bumped into double digits and consolidated underneath the $17 level, the bulls might soon lose vigor. If the price is corrected, the coin will fall to $15.60 and then to $14. Once the coin loses the $14 mark, the bears will be back in the market. The amount of SOL traded in the last session was green, indicating bullishness. Technical Analysis SOL had not touched this level on the Relative Strength Index for months. This marked a multi-month high on the Relative Strength Index. The indicator was above the 80 mark, indicating that buyers exceeded market sellers. Due to increased demand, Solana was above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which indicated that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Additionally, SOL was also above the 50-SMA line. This reflected the idea that SOL might soon be correcting itself over the next trading sessions. The altcoin sided with the other technical indicators, which indicated increased demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) portrays price momentum and reversals. MACD was green as it indicated buy signals in anticipation that the price might rise before it starts to retrace on the chart.

This comes at a time when the crypto market is seeing struggling prices marked with low momentum. Now, with these large investors picking up the pace with their investments, there could be more movement on the horizon for bitcoin. Bitcoin Whales Fill Up Their Bags Data from on-chain aggregator Santiment shows that large bitcoin whales holding between 1,000-10,000 BTC are accelerating their accumulation. Over the last five days, these large investors have added more than 20,000 BTC to their balances, making it a significant accumulation trend.

BTC whales accumulate over 20,000 coins | Source: Twitter The accumulation trend comes hot on the heels of low activity recorded by these large bitcoin whales. As Bitcoinist reported, large whale transactions fell to only 19% of total bitcoin transactions indicating fatigue on the part of these large wallets. However, the new accumulation of data points to a more long-term play on the parts of these whales. It also shows a willingness to buy at current levels which could mean that large BTC whales could believe that the price of the digital asset may have hit its bottom. Will BTC Continue Uptrend? Bitcoin is now trading comfortably above the $17,000 level after a late weekend rally pushed it above the important technical level. At current prices, the digital asset is tethering just around its 50-day moving average of $17,212, which puts it in a precarious position. Such levels mean that the price of the cryptocurrency could swing either way and what’s more, is that it wouldn’t take much to trigger a tilt. So while the accumulation of these large whales may have been part of the trigger for the uptrend, there needs to be more demand for BTC to continue upwards and break successfully above its 50-day moving average. BTC price trending above $17,300 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com If it were to fall below this level, then support for BTC is still sitting at $16,600 and this could mean a freewill to lose around $500 off bitcoin’s value. However, if momentum were to pick up, then BTC will test the $17,500 resistance before the end of the week.

The Shanghai upgrade will enable withdrawals of Ethereum that has been staked for rewards - an action that isn't currently possible. ETH withdrawal could conceivably lead to more ETH supply coming into the market and sell pressure on the coin price. I view this as unlikely as Ethereum's staking ratio is already low compared to other top PoS chains and Ethereum users have largely turned to liquid staking protocols already. It has been about four months since the successful transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain. The much anticipated catalyst turned out to be a ""sell the news"" event with ETH declining roughly 15% shortly following the completion of the merge. That decline was short-lived, however, as Ethereum rallied from $1,220 in late-September up to $1,680 in early-November. Then FTX (FTT-USD) collapsed and the rest is history; the broad crypto slide resumed and we're still learning of some of the contagion implications. Despite the apparent off-chain issues at centralized companies like Gemini and Digital Currency Group, the on-chain assets appear to be forming a short-term bottom with Ethereum having now rallied 25% from the post-FTX low of $1,080 in November. For Ethereum bulls and smart contract investors more broadly, the next big catalyst for the Ethereum blockchain may be the upcoming Shanghai upgrade. In this article, we'll get into what Shanghai enables, and assess what it could mean for both Ethereum and one of the more popular protocols that is built on Ethereum: Lido Finance ( LDO-USD ). What is Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade? The Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain is the next upgrade in the chain's technological development. According to the Ethereum community , the main change to Ethereum from Shanghai will be the ability for Ethereum stakers to withdraw funds from stake: This network upgrade is estimated for the first half of 2023, subject to change until completed. After the Shanghai update, stakers will then be able to withdraw their rewards and/or principle [sic] deposit from their validator balance if they choose. In a recent meeting , the Ethereum core developers put a March 2023 target for the Shanghai upgrade. Unlike most other proof-of-stake blockchains, which have allowed coin withdrawal from the beginning, stakers on Ethereum's Beacon chain aren't currently able to withdraw funds. Staked ETH (Dune Analytics/hildobby) The ability to take coins out of stake is significant and could potentially have an impact on the 15.9 million ETH that are currently staked on the blockchain. ETH Supply Flood? Enabling ETH withdrawal from stake following Shanghai does raise a key question; could unstaking put sell pressure on Ethereum as funds come out of lock? Possibly. But I think there might be a greater chance that the ability to unstake could actually bring more ETH into stake rather than out of stake. I take this view because I think there are potential staking participants on the sidelines who have been waiting to see how the merge and subsequent network upgrades go before locking funds without an ability to withdraw. Despite Ethereum's massive TVL, the network has a relatively small staking ratio compared to other smart contract blockchains: Blockchain TVL in $ Staking Ratio Ethereum $24.6b 13.8% Binance Smart Chain ( BNB-USD ) $4.4b 97.2% Tron ( TRX-USD ) $4.1b 45.0% Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) $1.0b 39.4% Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) $797m 62.5% Sources: DeFi Llama, StakingRewards.com Even if ETH stakers wanted to immediately get their coins out following the implementation of the Shanghai upgrade, most won't be able to right away as there will be a limited number of coins that can be withdrawn per epoch : full validator exits are rate limited by the protocol, so only six validators may exit per epoch (every 6.4 minutes, so 1350 per day, or only ~43,200 ETH per day This means that with just under 16 million ETH currently in stake, it would take a year of constant withdrawals to drain the ETH staked on chain for selling purposes. Furthermore, what will the motivation be to get ETH out of stake? Sell at a loss? ETH Stakers (Dune Analytics/hildobby) 72% of the coins that have been staked on Ethereum are underwater. In my view, it's more likely these market participants with staked ETH are closer to long-haul Ethereum supporters rather than seekers of short-term gains from any ETH merge narrative trade. The Liquid Stake Trade If the Shanghai upgrade does take place in March, I think it might paradoxically be a catalyst for more staking on Ethereum. In my view, enabling ETH stake withdrawals de-risks staking ETH on chain and could theoretically lead to an increase in ETH's staking ratio rather than a decrease. If that is indeed the case, DeFi applications that enable liquid staking figure to enjoy increases in user adoption. I've covered two of the more popular liquid staking protocols on Ethereum in the past; one for Seeking Alpha's public site and the other as a 'Top Token Idea' for subscribers of BlockChain Reaction . Without re-writing my original Lido Finance article from last July, the two main problems that liquid staking applications on Ethereum solve are the staking threshold minimum and the locking of funds. When a user stakes ETH through a liquid staking application like Lido, the user doesn't need a minimum of 32 ETH to enjoy staking rewards and the platform mints an ETH derivative, in Lido's case stETH, which can be used in various other DeFi applications for additional on-chain activities. Staked ETH Share (Dune Analytics/hildobby) This ability to stake ETH without the high minimum but also maintain liquidity has led to Lido Finance accounting for 29% of all of the ETH that has been staked. And Lido is just one liquid staking platform; liquid staking on Ethereum cumulatively makes up 43% of the Ethereum in stake. In my view, this gives credence to the idea that ETH withdrawals won't lead to a supply flood - ETH stakers have already had liquidity options if they want them. If anything, I take the view that enabling withdrawals will see more Ethereum coming into stake. In which case, the staking minimum of 32 ETH still applies and market participants will likely look to liquid staking products like those that are offered by Lido Finance or Coinbase ( COIN ): Name Staked ETH TVL Market Share Lido Finance 4,859,909 $6.52b 74.66% Coinbase 1,025,945 $1.36b 15.76% Rocket Pool 352,168 $472.51m 5.41% StakeWise 82,525 $110.73m 1.27% StakeHound 65,379 $87.72m 1.00% Source: DeFi Llama The top 3 liquid stake applications make up more than 95% of the liquid staked ETH and Lido is by far the top protocol in the category. Despite what I view as a strong fundamental setup for liquid staking on Ethereum as a general idea, I would caution getting overly exuberant with Lido Finance's application governance token as a trade currently: LDO Price to Fees (Circulating) (Token Terminal) Lido's LDO token has rallied over 100% in just two weeks and is currently trading at a 5.4x price to fees ratio, indicating it is overvalued based on the coin's past trading history. Risks Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade could once again be a sell the news event as the merge was before it. It's also possible the upgrade actually does lead to a flow of ETH out of stake - the result of which would likely lead to lower ETH prices. For Lido Finance specifically, the protocol has a commanding share of not just liquid staking being done on Ethereum, but staking on Ethereum in general. It's entirely possible Lido Finance loses staking share to other DeFi protocols or centralized business competitors like Coinbase. Summary The Shanghai upgrade is a fast approaching catalyst for Ethereum that will enable staked ETH withdrawals. While there is some thinking that this could lead to a large flow of ETH coming out of stake and creating a supply flood that crushes price, I think one could actually make the case that it will do the opposite and see more ETH going into stake. I take this view because the current ETH in stake is a low percentage of the total supply and is already very liquid with 43% of it having derivative tokens minted for further deployment in DeFi platforms or outright selling to new holders. If Shanghai results in more ETH coming into stake, platforms like Lido Finance and Coinbase's ETH staking product could benefit by serving token holders with smaller positions who don't meet the minimum staking requirements of home validation on Ethereum. All that said, caution is likely warranted as the recent exuberance from LDO buyers has led to a rise in token price that has outpaced growth in demand for the product over the last few weeks as evidenced by the high price to fees ratio in the coin.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | ICO | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569097-ethereum-staking-with-lido-finance-shanghai-catalyst?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7370041.jpeg

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  This figure would amount to around 20% of Coinbase's workforce, which sits at about 4,700 according to the company's website.  In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday, Coinbase said it is responding to ""ongoing market conditions impacting the crypto economy.""  The company expects the restructuring to cost $149 million to $163 million, including $58 million to $68 million in cash charges related to employee severance.  Coinbase began shedding jobs in June when crypto's bear market started to take hold. CEO Brian Armstrong said at the time that the company had ""grown too quickly"" during the crypto bull market, expanding to more than 5,000 employees from 1,250 at the start of 2021. The firm began by cutting 1,100 jobs, equivalent to 18% of its workforce at the time, followed by another 60 in November as the crypto winter grew even colder with the collapse of rival exchange FTX.  Analysts on Wall Street reacted positively to Coinbase's job cuts announcement on Tuesday. “We are encouraged by this morning's news, as it shows the company is taking financial discipline seriously in a very challenging crypto/macro environment,” analysts from Barclay’s wrote, while acknowledging that it could also be a sign that the company is preparing for a tough year ahead.

Viewing any indicator in isolation is risky at best and reckless at worst.  A look back at when BTC breached an upper limit on Dec 13 shows a 2% decline in prices 14 days later. ETH’s prior breach on Oct. 29, saw prices down a whopping 22% after 14 days.  Bullish investors will note that prices are entering a range of prior low activity. These “low volume nodes” generally represent areas where prices move quickly, in search of the next area of price agreement.  For bitcoin, that area currently exists 9% higher, near the $19,000 range. For ether, the next high-volume node area is approximately 16% higher, near $1,590.  Read the full technical take here.

With the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, chaos erupted in the crypto markets. Prices of almost all the crypto assets took a hit. Also, the negative contagion effect sprung up within the crypto space as the number of investors who lost funds on the platform kept increasing. However, the beginning of this new year shows signs of a positive dawn for most crypto assets. The crypto market has started seeing some green performance. For instance, MATIC has shown impressive performance by soaring on the chart. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Up Nearly 20%, Aiming For A Higher High? Increased Trading Volume For MATIC Recently, crypto whales are showing more interest in MATIC due to upward price movements in the coin this year. The 24-hour trading volume for MATIC sits at over $376 million, showing a surge of 174.80% and implying increased interest in the token. An anonymous whale was reported to have transferred MATIC tokens worth approximately $8 million. The transfer was done on the Binance crypto exchange as a single transaction. Lookonchain, an on-chain data provider, reported the whale’s transfer on its Twitter page. According to the data provider, the whale has been gathering Polygon tokens from different exchanges and through staking. The whale’s address has gotten up to 153 million MATIC tokens at an average price of $1.16 Also, on January 5, Lookonchain reported a huge MATIC transaction from another crypto whale SmartMoney. The whale is known to indulge in low buying and higher sales. SmartMoney moved 2.12 million MATIC tokens worth about $1.7 million to the Kraken crypto exchange. According to the data, SmartMoney purchased up to 1.76 million MATIC coins from Uniswap at $0.87. The whale later sold 1.08 million of the tokens at $1.44. MATIC Price Performance A closer look at the price movement of MATIC revealed the token fared positively from the last week of last year to the beginning of this year. The token has recorded $0.7727 and $0.8637 as its 7-day low and 7-day high, respectively. At the time of writing, MATIC is trading at $0.8391, indicating a rise of 7.51% in its value over the past 24 hours. Its market cap is about $7.53 billion, and is ranked among the top 10 crypto assets per CoinMarketCap. On January 1, 2023, MATIC opened trading at $0.7585. But before the day’s end, the token price rose to $0.76. The next day, MATIC started at $0.76 and ended at $0.7809. The token remained at that price level till January 5, when it hit $0.8063.

42393872,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brb0tJ,1673384299,"Crypto Markets Analysis: Early Signs of Higher Volatility May Be Creeping Into Bitcoin, Ether","On a list of 87 cryptocurrencies I track, 29 of them suddenly appeared Tuesday on a technical screen that identifies increased price volatility.  For bitcoin (BTC), it was the third appearance in as many days. Ether (ETH) has appeared on the screen in five of the last seven days. Other notable coins making an appearance include BNB, AAVE, SOL and DOT.  The development, while early, is worth noting, as it may indicate a growing appetite for risk in crypto markets. And it's perhaps a welcome change after several weeks in which bitcoin mostly traded flat, in a range between $16,000 and $17,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market value broke out of that range earlier this week.  The technical screen for volatility is simple enough. Within the basket of 87 cryptocurrencies:  Take measure of each coin’s 20-period moving average  Calculate two standard deviations above and below the moving average  Set an alert if any asset breaches the upper or lower limit of the standard deviations  For those taking notes, this is a simple Bollinger Band screen. Statistically, an asset’s price is expected to stay within two standard deviations of its average 95% of the time; thus, a breach of a Bollinger Band is worth paying attention to.  There are two prevailing trains of thought.  A move past an upper limit is meaningful and signals future bullish price action.  A move past an upper limit is overdone, and prices will likely revert to the mean.  The knee-jerk reaction to an upper-limit breach is often optimistic. Viewing any indicator in isolation is risky at best and reckless at worst.  A look back at when BTC breached an upper limit on Dec. 13 shows a 2% decline in prices 14 days later. ETH’s prior breach on Oct. 29 saw prices down a whopping 22% after 14 days.  Bullish investors will note that prices are entering a range of prior low activity. These “low volume nodes” generally represent areas where prices move quickly, in search of the next area of price agreement.  For bitcoin, that area currently exists 9% higher near the $19,000 range. For ether, the next high-volume node area is approximately 16% higher, near $1,590.  Also encouraging for the bullish investor is that exchange balances for BTC and ETH have not increased sharply as prices have increased. An uptick in BTC or ETH being sent to exchanges is often a bearish signal, as coins are sent to exchanges for the purpose of selling.  Bearish investors may point to the decline in overall volume for both BTC and ETH as signs the increase in price is exhausted and poised to decline.  All investors should keep an eye on the increase in volatility. The lack of price volatility in recent months has left little opportunity on the table for bulls or bears. Recent signs indicate that this may be shifting.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/10/crypto-markets-analysis-early-signs-of-higher-volatility-may-be-creeping-into-bitcoin-ether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/762eda2d31d4f0ca85e93e6c29d346ec1f9d1281-4278x5348.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411265,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMZzf,1673384017,"Bored Apes, a Troll and a Conspiracy Walk Into a Courtroom ...","Wylie Aronow and Greg Solano, the co-creators of the perennially popular Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible token (NFT) series, will be deposed as part of an ongoing trademark lawsuit Yuga Labs, the corporate backer of BAYC, filed against conceptual artist Ryder Ripps. They didn’t want to take the stand, but they didn’t want to be “doxxed” either.  In a Jan. 5 court filing ahead of a hearing on Monday, Yuga argued co-founders Aronow and Solano were “apex witnesses” and would not need to be deposed if lower-level employees could testify in their place. Although the case is focused particularly on the narrow legal issue of trademark infringement, Ripps has been waging a yearlong PR campaign to paint the Bored Apes and related intellectual property as covertly racist and pro-Nazi projects.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  John E. McDermott, the federal magistrate in California overseeing the case, wrote that the co-founders are “the only people who have knowledge of the” trademarks at the center of the lawsuit. He further admonished Yuga’s delayed responses and “lack of diligence” ahead of scheduled hearings, Decrypt reported.  The fact that Aronow and Solano initially looked to finagle their way out of a deposition (as part of a case Yuga filed) only goes to show the trouble Yuga has had responding to Ripps’ provocations. They’re now dealing with the consequences of filing suit against the prankster – which brings a matter Yuga would rather forget further into the public light.  Beginning in early 2022, Ripps began waging a campaign against Yuga Labs, looking to unravel an allegedly vast and oblique alt-right and neo-Nazi conspiracy. He claimed the company’s founders were internet trolls who embedded racist “dog-whistles,” or coded messages, across the brand they were building – like noting the similarities between the BAYC logo and an SS insignia.  By many accounts, Ripps – who has a long history of turning internet trolls into statement pieces – was successful. He bought the domain name GordonGoner.com – referring to the pseudonym Aronow used initially – that ranks highly in internet searches and leads to a webpage detailing the supposedly offensive imagery.  Yuga, of course, has denied these accusations. Experts from the Anti-Defamation League civil liberties group also have looked askance at Ripps’ assertions (though it did note the dripped-out Bored Apes may lean on stereotypes of hip hop culture). A conspiracy does not need to be true to spread – especially one that can find fault or a supposed historical allusion anywhere.  Ripps’ crowning achievement was the launch of his project, RR/BAYC. It was a series of 10,000 NFTs that correspond to the original BAYC set – sharing the same names, features and underlying media – that were sold on the same marketplaces Yuga uses to sell its NFTs. Beyond its political statement, Ripps said his copycat series raised questions about digital ownership and functionality of NFTs – a topic he’s explored before.  See also: CryptoPunks Get Punked | Opinion  However, for many, Ripps’ antics seemed like a slam-dunk example of infringement of intellectual property. Yuga claimed Ripps’s RR/BAYC NFT collection tricked consumers looking to buy genuine Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTS – netting Ripps and his team some $1.8 million. On June 24, shortly after Ripps’ collection briefly supplanted the real BAYC as the top-selling NFT collection on OpenSea, Yuga sued.  “[I]t's interesting Yuga is pursuing this via trademark rather than copyright. In a lot of ways, a DMCA takedown for copyright infringement is easier and more straightforward, but I suspect most of the value of BAYC and related brands is via trademark, not copyright,” law professor, artist and CoinDesk contributor Brian Frye said at the time.  The case also offered Yuga a chance at silencing Ripps without necessarily diving into the lurid conspiracy. It was about the theft of trademarks, potentially misled consumers and infringement. Textbook stuff.  This was upheld recently when a California court denied Ripps’ anti-SLAPP countersuit, aka Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, a way to petition a judge to throw out a lawsuit that curtails someone's right to free speech. The judge also challenged Ripps’ defense that his use of Yuga’s property was protected by fair use.  In what could have legal precedence for future NFT disputes, the judge found the “Rogers test” – a longstanding protection for artistic use of trademarks – did not apply in Ripps’ circumstance because his use of the underlying BAYC’s intellectual property (IP) for RR/BAYC failed to ""express an idea or point of view."" Moreover, Yuga's IP was used to further Ripps' own ""commercial activities.”  It’s worth noting that Ripps’ NFTs, even if on the surface exact replicas of another project, have an identity of their own. It seems clear enough that Ripps' supporters and fans knew what they were buying, often in protest of the Bored Apes. And we should not be so patronizing to say people do not understand the concept of provenance or parody.  See also: The Art World Underestimates the Power of NFTs | Opinion  But because the court is starting from the principle that Ripps is a salesman and not an artist, the trademark dispute seems cut and dry. On the various marketplaces his NFTs were sold, Ripps sometimes used the BAYC insignia rather than his slightly altered RR/BAYC to identify the project. Further still, on NFT marketplace Foundation, Ripps took the basic BAYC URL you might expect the real BAYC to have. He also inconsistently included a disclaimer stating his work was satire – perhaps demonstrating “awareness” the work was misleading, the court said.  Discussing Ripps’ work, the judge said that “commercial activities designed to sell infringing products [is] no more artistic than the sale of a counterfeit handbag.” (Ripps, and his fellow defendant Jeremy Cahen, intend to appeal the anti-anti-SLAPP motion in the Ninth Circuit court.)  Despite all this, it’s still likely that Yuga was strategically and morally wrong to file a lawsuit. To be fair, the BAYC ""community"" at the time the lawsuit began was begging Yuga to act. Though it was never exactly clear what the recourse was. In June, Yuga representatives recommended that I write a story about Ripps’ old Tumblr that contained numerous problematic images (trigger warning, NSFW) – as if hypocrisy is a smoking gun.  But a lawsuit is, first, not very cypherpunk and, second, a messy way to counter “disinformation.” Even if Yuga wins on the trademark issue, that will not curtail Ripps’ ability to speak openly about his suspicions. It also will force Yuga’s publicity-shy founders to testify under oath, giving Ripps a platform as well as the content and attention he feeds desires. And yet, leaning away from the opportunity only makes things worse.  Perhaps it was worth it for the dominant NFT company, Yuga, which has historically been “generous” in terms of granting token holders commercial rights over their NFTs, to take a stand regarding their intellectual property. But it still seems odd that a $4 billion enterprise is concerned at all with Ripps’ actions – which, if being honest, have artistic merit.  Ripps’ claim was that it's the blockchain that matters, the strings of alphanumeric lettering and cryptographic key sets that distinguishes a work. RR/BAYC and BAYC, which rely on the same images, are provably distinct because the tokens are. The creator’s intent only comes in after that, and has to be read into the work – not even the artist can say, in the final analysis, what it means.  See also: NFTs Are Securities and It's Great | Opinion  There are some people who see Ripps’ NFTs as a work of great satirical profundity and others as a naked grift. And so must it be with Bored Apes, no matter what Aronow, Solano or Ripps have to say: a conspiracy for some, not others. But it can be a lot more than that, too.  As Frye said: “The lawsuit is only looking more unwise for Yuga, which has more important things to be dealing with. The Streisand effect is real and predictably is only hurting their brand.

The Los Angeles-based company is a middleman for global companies looking to expand their endeavors in the metaverse. It has partnered with the likes of retailer Forever 21, ""The Voice"" program and even Mattel's Barbie.  Hochberg said the company focuses on building “a whole new set of ways” for brands to connect with consumers while generating revenue. Though he did not disclose the amount of revenue the company has generated for its partners, he said VBG “makes multiple millions of dollars in virtual goods.”  Those virtual goods are divided into categories, according to Hochberg, and include token-based marketplaces, sponsorships with brands and rewards programs, which he said the company is planning to implement next on the popular entertainment program “The Voice.”  “Our expertise ranges across all of those things,” Hochberg said. He added that what the metaverse provides in value is elbow room for companies that may not have exceedingly large budgets.  Hochberg noted that Roblox, an online gaming platform, is one way brands can use online marketplaces to increase a brand's visibility.  ""Forever 21 ... had not done a thing in the metaverse 12 months ago,"" Hochberg said. Now, the company is ranked as ""one of the top 10 metaverse brands,"" according to Analytics Insight.  VBG, too, has partnered with Mattel's Barbie, he added.  “All of this will open up eventually,” Hochberg said. “From our strategy, we go to brands, we make it easy for them by finding something they feel familiar with, and then we extend it.”  Read more: Virtual Worlds, Real-Life Use Cases: How Web2 and Web3 Tackled the Metaverse at CES 2023  CORRECTION (Jan. 18 17:00 UTC): Corrects that Roblox sells only virtual goods, not physical ones.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/10/metaverse-can-build-access-for-big-companies-says-virtual-brand-group-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ebfa116f68f7fbbc89e1eb176fefb7854473a936-940x524.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""The process of maintaining the peg involves many teams and has not always been flawless, which may have resulted in operational delays in the past,"" a Binance spokesperson told Bloomberg. Until recently, though, that process ""has been much improved with enhanced discrepancy checks to ensure it's always 1-1 pegged.""

BUSD is branded by Binance but issued by Paxos Trust, an entirely separate entity. While other stablecoins such as tether ( USDT-USD ) and USD Coin ( USDC-USD ) are pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, Binance-peg USD, which was created to have a version of BUSD that could operate on blockchains beyond the ether ( ETH-USD ) network, is backed one-to-one by locked reserves of BUSD. The Binance spokesperson noted that the issues in Binance-peg BUSD did not impact user redemptions, but neither specified for how long the stablecoin was undercollateralized, nor when Binance noticed the issue and resolved it. In response to the report, Binance pointed out past occasions of a ""timing mismatch in backing Binance-peg BUSD with BUSD.

""Having identified this ourselves last year we now rebalance more frequently to ensure that Binance-Peg BUSD is transparently fully backed,"" it added.

The market generally recorded a 0.3% decrease in the last 24 hours. But as most of the assets falter, some tokens record exponential gains. LDO, the governance token of the Lido DAO network, has increased in value in the past week. The token is up by 62.83% in weekly gains and currently trading at $1.99, a 1.31% increase in 24 hours. The Lido DAO project is a staking platform where users can stake their ETH tokens. The platform also offers DeFi lending services and requires no minimum deposits. With different financial services and the flexibility of its platform, this upsurge shows increased adoption by users for a variety of purposes. Related Reading: Why The VIX Could Predict A 20% Bitcoin And Crypto Rally Despite the uncertain times in the crypto space Lido DAO (LDO) has continued to perform well since the turn of the year. Some factors are behind this recent resurgence and will influence how long the bullish momentum will last. Why Is Lido DAO (LIDO) On The Rise? Some parameters are responsible for the price surge in Lido DAO. A Twitter user states that the Lido finance native token has soared nearly 60% in the last week. The user attributed this to Ethereum’s upcoming Shanghai fork. This update will enable users to withdraw their staked ETH tokens. Secondly, BitForex announced the listing of LDO on the exchange. This listing has increased the project’s scope and is partly responsible for the price increase noted in the token. However, Twitter user John Cook has expressed pessimism about Lido DAO’s newfound price momentum. In his tweet on January 8, he referred to the seven-day rise of the token as a pump-and-dump. He also alleged that the project was ripping off retail investors and spending more on marketing costs than engineering. Despite his protests, the LDO token remains among the top gainers this week. The price surge has seen Lido DAO become the largest Decentralized Finance protocol in the world. The project has a total locked value above $6.9 billion. Can The Bulls Sustain The Rally? LDO token is currently in an uptrend on the chart, with the formation of simultaneous green candles. The support levels are $1.6647, $1.7561, and $1.8495. Its resistance levels are $2.03, $2.13, and $2.22. LDO is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages. These two indicators are showing a buy signal at the moment. Therefore, it implies that the token’s short-term and long-term price movement is bullish. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator indicates a buy signal. With the oversold region below 30 and the overbought region above 70, the current RSI value of the token is 82.22. Traders will likely take long positions in the market. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) is well above its signal line and shows divergence. The signal is also a buy but might be for the short term. LDO is still off its ATH (all-time high) value of $11.00. The token will likely continue on its ascent as more investors buy into the project.

This smells like a fire sale but does improve the company's chances of survival in my view. Still, company strategy and management credibility have been shown badly wanting and I remain bearish. U.K.-based crypto miner Argo Blockchain ( ARBK ) has seen some strong price action in its shares in recent weeks. However I remain bearish and indeed took advantage of a recent sharp price rise to sell my existing position (at a large loss). In around a year and a half of covering the name I have moved between positive, neutral and negative positions on the company. (That in itself perhaps ought to have made me think harder about my analytical framework). For now, I remain bearish. Good news At the end of last year, the company announced some important news. It sold its large mining facility in Texas for $65 million (£54 million), refinanced its asset-backed loans, and entered into a hosting agreement to maintain its mining machines at the Texas facility. Fuller details of the transaction can be found here . The company described these as “transformational strategic transactions” and I think that is fair. I also see it as good news. I previously had doubts about Argo’s ability to maintain a going concern if it did not improve its finances. In October, it announced a series of “strategic actions to strengthen the company's balance sheet”, including diluting shareholders and selling thousands of its mining machines (“new in box”). Those transactions were expected to ensure that Argo had sufficient working capital for a year. This smells like a fire sale to me. I think the latest transaction is good news for Argo because it bolsters liquidity and helps raise the company’s working capital. But I also see it as a bad signal. It is less than a year since the Texas facility opened (or “energised” in the company’s jargon, which itself ought to have been a warning to me). This was the centrepoint of the firm’s strategy, yet it has now been sold, along with thousands of machines the company bought but did not even take out of their boxes. Either the strategy is deeply flawed, management is incompetent or both (which is my take). Risks and potential reward Argo has been hit like its peers by falling crypto prices, with Bitcoin (BTC-USD) down around three fifths in the past year. If prices come back, that could help the firm’s profitability. At the half year level the company reported a £30.5m loss after taxation, compared to a £7.2m post-tax profit at the same stage the prior year. Rising crypto prices could help boost profitability while further falls could hurt it. The current market cap is around $67m. The most recent transactions “will reduce total indebtedness by $41 million” although it is unclear to me what the company’s current net debt is. But could the shares be a bargain if Argo survives as a going concern (which the latest transactions make more probable, in my view) and benefits from the next upswing in crypto pricing? I definitely think it could. However, the risks here are way too high for my tolerance. Crypto pricing is central to Argo’s valuation and it has no control over it. I have grave doubts about the company’s management and strategy. Further shareholder dilution to boost liquidity is a clear risk and I also continue to see ultimate bankruptcy as a risk, although for now at least the recent transactions have bolstered the balance sheet. My mistakes analysing Argo Given how I now feel about Argo, how did I ever decide to buy it? My stake was a small one of just a few hundred dollars which I bought partly to have some skin in the game analytically, a motivation I now question. Normally when investing I look for a company that has already proven it can be consistently profitable, even if at the time I buy it may be lossmaking. Two of my biggest investing mistakes over the past couple of years as judged by percentage loss did not clearly meet this criterion (as well as Argo, the other is kidney diagnostic firm Renalytix ( RNLX )). In the case of Argo, though, it came close: it recorded post-tax profits in both 2020 and 2021. While the 2020 profit was fairly small (£1.4m), 2021 came in at £30.8m. I saw that as a sign of fast growth rather than a lack of long-term consistent profitability. In the future I think I would look for more than just a couple of years of profits as proof of consistent profitability. But I also missed or ignored other red flags. Take this insightful comment from November on an article I wrote in May, by SA user Norman Bates at Disneyland: comment on article (Seeking Alpha) In 2021, legal, professional and regulatory fees jumped 1,344% from the year before to £1.5m. Total administrative expenses that year jumped nearly fourfold. Admittedly this was during a period of company expansion but in retrospect that sort of jump now looks like a red flag. More information on fees in the October and December transactions is lacking, but will hopefully emerge at the full year level. However, Norman Bates at Disneyland’s attention to such metrics seems valuable and I ought to have paid closer attention myself. I also somewhat deluded myself by believing that one could separate the risks of investing in crypto (which I see as a Ponzi scheme) from investing in a company with a business model heavily linked to crypto pricing, which I did for example by considering other uses to which Argo’s data centres could be put to use. Valuing Argo Blockchain shares It has been possible to make big money on Argo in the past several weeks, with the shares doubling in a single day’s trading at one point and other big moves. However, I see that as akin to speculation rather than investment. The link to crypto pricing remains, the company’s strategy now looks doubtful (and at the tactical level seems to be survival) and I have no confidence in its management. On that basis, while a turnaround in its fortunes could conceivably lead to a big share price jump, I ascribe no value to the shares.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569064-argo-blockchain-down-but-not-out-except-from-portfolio?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7365254.jpeg

However, they said the layoffs could also be a sign the crypto exchange company is preparing for a tough year ahead.  Coinbase said it will cut 950 jobs, about 20% of its current workforce, in a move to bring down the company’s operating expenses by roughly 25% by the end of March. The U.S. exchange already laid off over 1,000 employees in June.  Coinbase’s stock surged almost 9% to $41.62 on the job cut news as multiple Wall Street banks reiterated their positive long-term outlook on the company.

""This job cut is a reflection of the current challenging environment so that Coinbase can maintain a certain loss guardrail,"" Owen Lau, analyst at Oppenheimer said. ""Unfortunately many crypto companies may not make it, but Coinbase has a strong balance sheet and could emerge stronger on the other side.""  Meanwhile, asset manager Needham, which expects COIN to trade at $73 by the end of the year and kept the stock at a buy rating, wrote in a note Tuesday that the company’s headcount reductions are a “necessary step” given the uncertain volume picture this year, but said investors should remain cautious about the continuing fallout from FTX’s collapse.  Coinbase, which makes the majority of its money from retail trading fees, saw a steep decline in revenue in 2022 as a result of multiple bankruptcies in the crypto market, including those of Celsius Network and FTX, which caused distrust among investors and a sharp fall in trading volume across the industry.  Some analysts believe that Coinbase’s co-ownership in Circle’s USDC stablecoin and the expansion of that could help the company in the long term, citing growing market dominance. USDC, which has a market cap of $44 billion, is currently the fourth-largest token behind bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and tether (USDT) but has recently narrowed the gap with USDT “tremendously,” Barclays wrote.  Needham wrote it “remains positive” on interest income from the expansion of USDC, as well.  UPDATE (Jan. 10, 20:44 UTC): Adds comment from Owen Lau, analyst at Oppenheimer.

Riot has been executing well on its power strategy. The company sold 600 Bitcoins in December, generating $10.2 million in net proceeds. Some of Riot's operations at the Rockdale facility were affected by winter weather in Texas, impacting approximately 2.5 EH/s of its total hash rate capacity. Riot deployed 16,128 new S-19 Series miners recently, bringing its hash rate to a new high. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), formerly Riot Blockchain, is one of the premier Bitcoin mining companies from a profitability perspective (I have covered this firm multiple times in the past, and you can filter for the entire history of my coverage here , complete with crypto cheatsheets and industry commentary). It has been a tough year for Riot shareholders. The sharp crypto selloff has battered the stock, and there is no sign of a bottom in sight. Despite the significant PR and legislative commentary in the past, crypto mining companies can still be viewed as small companies in that they usually produce one product, and for Riot, that product is Bitcoin. With the complexity and shiny object syndrome surrounding Bitcoin, at times, it is easy to forget that Bitcoin miners operate in the same way fundamentally as rare earth miners in that they stockpile tokens at low prices and distribute them at advantageous prices. Due to this dynamic, the price action for miners is greatly determined by the price of the crypto token they mine, which explains what has been happening with Riot. The stock has fallen off a cliff despite clear signs of progress internally. Data by YCharts Earnings & Production Update In December 2022, Riot produced 659 bitcoins, an increase of 26% from the previous month and 55% higher than its December 2021 production. Company Type January December November October September 3-Month AVG Riot Bitcoins mined 659 521 509 355 563 Author estimates adapted from Seeking Alpha The company earned $4.9 million in power credits during the month, which is equivalent to approximately 290 bitcoins using the December 2022 weighted average daily closing price of $16,967. The company has been strategically executing its power strategy to drive lower power costs. A summary of the strategy can be found below: Riot Platforms Riot sold 600 bitcoins in December, generating net proceeds of around $10.2 million, and held approximately 6,952 bitcoins as of December 31, 2022. Forced sales or sales at disadvantageous prices are often red flags for Bitcoin mining companies like Riot, but in the context of a crypto bear market, it is understandable to see some liquidation at this point. Investors should be well aware of the risks for mining companies in this environment by now, so it is unlikely that further sales will be met by any sensational price action. Moving on to the fleet, Riot deployed an additional 16,128 S-19-series miners, bringing its hash rate capacity to a new all-time high of 9.7 EH/s. However, some of the company's operations at its Rockdale facility sustained damage from severe winter weather in Texas, which impacted around 2.5 EH/s of its total hash rate capacity. Riot expects to have a total of 89,708 miners deployed with a hash rate capacity of around 9.9 EH/s, with shipments of an additional 5,130 S19-series miners expected to be received in January 2023. It is interesting that Riot continues to invest heavily in its fleet. At this point, the companies are selling tokens at a loss, and many miners have mining costs that hover around the ten thousand dollar mark. It is essential to note that spreading fixed costs like administration and real estate among many miners will aid margins, but this is hugely capital intensive, and the companies must balance this benefit against the risks of illiquidity should Bitcoin prices remain depressed for an extended period. In the recent third-quarter earnings call, Riot announced that the company had a total revenue of $46.3 million, compared to $64.8 million in the same period in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower Bitcoin production resulting from the company's power strategy and a 49% decrease in the market price of Bitcoin. This is a trend we are seeing with some of the bigger miners. The company earned $13.1 million in power curtailment credits in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $2.5 million in the same period in 2021. It produced 1,042 Bitcoin in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 1,292 in the same period in 2021. The company's mining revenue in the third quarter of 2022 was $22.1 million, compared to $53.6 million in the same period in 2021. Its data center hosting revenue was $8.4 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to $11.2 million in the same period in 2021. The company had $369.8 million in working capital and $255.0 million in cash on hand as of September 30, 2022, and it produced 6,766 Bitcoin in that period. Investors will want to pay keen attention to the cash balance in the future as these depressed Bitcoin prices and elevated cost of production begin to take agreed to effect on the company's balance sheet. We can see that the recent sales along with prior dilution have greatly improved the company's liquidity position. Data by YCharts Riot has always done relatively well with managing its cash balance and liquidity position. This has led to some analysts branding it the top pick of the Bitcoin mining space. It is important to note that despite the superior capital controls, Bitcoin mining companies are fundamentally the same business, and they cannot sustain long-term depressed prices. The company had a net loss of $14.9 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to a net loss of $47.3 million in the same period in 2021. Low-Cost Producer So earnings suggest Riot is actually showing some clear signs of progress despite the massive crypto meltdown, and much of this is attributable to their operational prowess. We have seen production disruptions seriously impact goals for other companies, but Riot has always seemed to be happy to continue to build out its fleet despite the massive industry-wide decline in profitability. Many analysts have painted a picture of doom and gloom because of the losses and harsh headlines, but Riot is a bit different. Riot is what you call a low-cost miner; that is, they are able to manage their direct costs of Bitcoin production better than many other firms. In the early Bitcoin mining explosion, many producers had their direct costs hovering around the $10k mark, and they could quickly sell their tokens on the market for 3 to 5 times that on the open market to fund other business expenses. Since then, the cost of energy has gone through the roof, and many miners have become more adept at managing those non-direct costs since they have limited control over energy rates. This is where Riot sets itself apart from the rest. Despite the rise in energy costs, Riot has managed to improve its direct mining costs from $15,250/BTC to just $11,346/BTC . Data by YCharts At the time of the writing of this article, Bitcoin was hovering at a price of ~$17,000. This means the company still has room to contribute to non-direct costs at current prices. It is important to emphasize that this is by no means a comfortable situation for investors or shareholders. As difficulty rates continue to increase, we will see direct costs naturally go up (discussed in greater detail here ), holding all other things constant. Also, for profitability to have a shot at happening at this level, the company would need to significantly increase the size of its fleet, which would likely require more cash than Riot can reasonably access. They also need to hope that their competitors avoid doing the same or that Bitcoin's network hashrate falls off a cliff. The Verdict I have been a long-time fan of buying the wash on mining companies and waiting for the eventual Bitcoin rally to unload, but this time feels different. The industry has been hit by a wave of defaults, and legislators could use Bitcoin miners as a scapegoat for investor losses. I see Riot as one of the best companies in the industry, but that industry is struggling right now. I am a long-term Bitcoin bull, but I do have concerns regarding whether some mining firms will make it to the other side of this slowdown. The risk of more losses or dilution will likely remain high for the extended future, but I continue to remain bullish on Riot. I rate the stock as a speculative buy.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569060-can-riot-platforms-weather-crypto-winter-increased-bitcoin-production?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7364532.jpeg

Writing in a letter to investors, Silbert (whose firm owns crypto trading firm Genesis, asset manager Grayscale, CoinDesk and other companies) said that ""this past year has been the most difficult of my life – both personally and professionally. Bad actors and repeated blow-ups have wreaked havoc on our industry, with ripple effects extending far and wide.""  He noted DCG has cut jobs and is winding down its crypto asset manager HQ.  In a Q&A section, Silbert waded into the controversy around Genesis and its customer Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins. Genesis' lending arm halted withdrawals in November, which locked up funds belonging to investors in Gemini's Earn product, leaving Gemini scrambling to figure out how to get money back to its customers.  Gemini raised the temperature in the fight this week, calling for Silbert to step down as CEO of DCG and officially canceling the Gemini Earn program. Gemini has raised questions about the movement of money between Genesis and DCG.  In his letter Tuesday, Silbert said DCG has borrowed from Genesis Capital, but ""these loans were always structured on an arm's length basis and were priced at prevailing market interest rates."" Silbert said DCG has a $1.1 billion promissory note maturing in 2032 with Genesis Capital, which arose from DCG assuming its subsidiary's bankruptcy claim against crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. DCG, according to the letter, also owes the subsidiary $447.5 million (of actual U.S. dollars, not crypto) borrowed between January and May 2022 at interest rates of 10% to 12%, plus 4,550 bitcoin (BTC), worth about $78 million.  As for DCG's role in Genesis Capital attempting to restructure, Silbert said: ""Because of the outstanding loans and the promissory note that DCG owes to Genesis Capital, DCG executives, including those on the Genesis board, have no decision-making authority related to any restructuring of Genesis Capital.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nick Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/10/dcgs-barry-silbert-talks-about-genesis-in-letter-to-shareholders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/213014734b9148b472930da2b11a98ec341cfea8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company made the decision “in accordance with instructions from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) as part of our pre-registration undertaking for a restricted dealer license,” a spokesperson for the exchange said in the email.  All USDT trading pairs, transactions, deposits and withdrawals will be delisted by 1 p.m. ET on Jan. 31, the email continues. All remaining USDT user deposits on the exchange after that time will be converted to Circle-issued USDC.  Crypto.com’s action comes as regulators around the world are increasing their scrutiny of centralized exchanges in the wake of the collapse of FTX and as competition between the top stablecoins grows.  The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the country’s top securities regulatory body consisting of regulators from 10 provinces and three territories , said last month it would strengthen its oversight over crypto exchanges by “expanding existing requirements"" for trading platforms operating in the country.

42414703,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBEI1d,1673374749,A Binance Stablecoin Wasn't Always Fully Backed: Bloomberg,"Binance acknowledged that its Binance-peg BUSD stablecoin hasn't always been backed fully with reserves, but said it's now fixed the problem, according to a report from Bloomberg.  The token was at times undercollateralized in 2020 and 2021, Bloomberg reported, citing an analysis by Jonathan Reiter of blockchain analytics company ChainArgos.  ""The process of maintaining the peg involves many teams and has not always been flawless, which may have resulted in operational delays in the past,"" a Binance spokesperson told Bloomberg. ""Recently, the process has been much improved with enhanced discrepancy checks to ensure it's always 1-1 pegged.""  The spokesperson noted that user redemptions were never impacted by the issue, but did not detail for how long Binance-peg BUSD was undercollaterized, nor when Binance discovered the issue and fixed it.  But in a blog post published after Bloomberg's article came out, Binance explained that there was a ""timing mismatch"" in backing Binance-peg BUSD with BUSD. ""From the data it is clear that the rebalancing did not always keep pace with the demand for Binance-Peg BUSD,"" Binance wrote. ""Having identified this ourselves last year we now rebalance more frequently to ensure that Binance-Peg BUSD is transparently fully backed.""  Binance-peg BUSD stablecoin is tied to the value of Paxos-issued BUSD and was created to have a version of BUSD that could operate on blockchains other than Ethereum, according to the report. It's backed 1-to-1 by locked reserves of BUSD.  The resiliency of stablecoins and whether they're backed by a reliable pile of money is a contentious one in the cryptocurrency industry. Stablecoins are meant to closely track the value of something else, often the U.S. dollar. So if investors have put, say, $10 billion into a stablecoin, there should, in theory, be $10 billion sitting somewhere to back it up. The largest stablecoin, Tether's USDT, has been dogged for years by concern that it has not been fully backed. In 2021, Tether was forced to pay $18.5 million in penalties after New York state found that it had falsely claimed that its stablecoin was fully backed 1-to-1 by U.S. dollars.

42417076,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOft,1673374561,A New Philosophy of Markets: Assets That Embody Technology,"Amid all the “bah, told you it was all worthless” commentary from skeptics recently, something crystallized for me. I did not fully appreciate how much public perception of crypto had shifted since the last time prices were bouncing along cyclical lows. Back then, crypto was a new type of money, a global computer, an engagement incentive, a governance value.  Now, in the eyes of the mainstream, crypto is a market.  Like many of you, I spent part of the end-of-year break explaining to family and friends that, no, crypto was not “over.” I puzzled for a while over the extent of this misconception until it clicked: It’s not that the crypto market got financialized – we all know that, just as we all recognize the damage done to perception and sentiment by the collapse of some of the main architects and beneficiaries of that financialization.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  It’s more that crypto became just a market for most casual observers. That’s all, just a market. And with the market in dire straits, well, obviously there’s no longer any point to the whole concept.  Looking back, it’s not hard to see how this shift happened. The increasing levels of institutional interest (Goldman Sachs! Fidelity! BlackRock!), prices (up 20% in a day! down 80% year to date!), scams (rug pull! exploit!) and regulatory concern (protect investors! protect the financial system!) fueled headlines that grabbed attention, incentivizing more stories along the same vein. The power of repetition as media coverage of the industry broadened cemented the association of “crypto” with “risky.”  I’m not pointing the finger at media – many publications have done a great job of also surfacing the more transformative aspects of our industry. But perception tends to latch on to what it can grasp, and the “public” (generalizing here) is familiar with markets, whereas it doesn’t necessarily understand Merkle trees. Price moves are easier to visualize than consensus algorithms. And the power of institutional signaling is more relatable than weighted decentralized liquidity pools. The markets narrative is stickier than the tech narrative because it is more comfortable. The risk narrative is stickier than the innovation narrative because drama is better at grabbing our attention.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Shifting Crypto's Center of Gravity  The instinctive reaction here, then, is to vow to start focusing more on the technology angles of crypto – I and many others have argued for that elsewhere. But while that is still the case, there’s another fundamental aspect of crypto evolution that has been largely overlooked.  We know that crypto assets are both speculative and investment opportunities. We also know they represent radical new technologies. We can acknowledge that they are all those at the same time. What is harder to wrap our heads around is that the asset is the technology.  For the first time in our history, we have tradable assets that embody innovation. Sure, investors can get exposure to progress through equities or exchange-traded funds, but they are formulaic wrappers around potential earnings streams that become available to the public only long after the innovation is first tested.  Amazon, for example, was founded in 1994 and scrabbled together a startup existence for three years before offering the public the opportunity to speculate. Facebook was founded in 2004 but didn’t offer a tradable asset to represent a bet on its potential until 2012. Both were considered extremely risky in their early pre-initial public offering days, too much so for mainstream investors. And both were extremely volatile at launch and for some time after.  Read more: Crypto 2023 - What's Going to Happen After FTX?  Even those examples are not exactly comparable. Amazon and Facebook are not new technologies. They represent a new use of a technology. And both have frequently, and especially in recent weeks, seen their values buffeted by corporate decisions and fiat economy-based earnings outlooks. Bitcoin, ether and others are the new technology. Technically, they are assets that move on new rails – but neither the assets nor the rails work or have value without the other. Plus, there is no earnings risk stemming from strategic decisions taken behind closed doors or from difficult economic conditions. It’s as if you had a chance to buy stock in the internet in 1985 that gave you pure exposure to its adoption, with no corporation risk.  What’s more, crypto assets open up support for innovation unlike any other tradable vehicle to date. They are pure technology plays that anyone, anywhere can invest in, without having to prove a certain amount of wealth for early access. They are risky, yes, but new concepts usually are, and education as well as platform disclosure rules could offer some protection without erecting inequality-enhancing barriers.  Crypto is so much more than a market. It is also more than a new technology. It is a new way of thinking about value, risk, funding and engagement. It adds a jugful of philosophy to the soup of finance, garnishes it with a few dashes of ingenious code and a sprinkle of hype, and stirs it up to get a whole new flavor of evolution.  Maybe this year we can do better at getting that message across. Maybe, with that, we will earn a more thoughtful type of criticism as well as a more nuanced approach to regulation. And, in thinking more about the messaging, perhaps even those of us in the industry can face the next cycle with fortified conviction that what we’re working on matters, probably more than most of us realize.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/10/a-new-philosophy-of-markets-assets-that-embody-technology,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7c855a03034ac88dddab27b28b4aa7616e419ed-5000x3800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Other altcoins have also moved in the same direction. At the moment, however, DOT has been trying to breach the immediate resistance of $5. In the past 24 hours, DOT noted a fall of 2%, but that could be attributed to a slight fall in demand for the altcoin. The technical outlook for Polkadot remains bullish. Buyers and demand for the altcoin have to keep mounting, and soon DOT will travel above the $5 level to trade near the $6 level. Accumulation has been growing in the last week as buyers have exceeded sellers at press time. It is critical, however, that DOT surpasses the $5 mark, or the coin will begin to trade lower, resulting in a loss of investor interest. Related Reading: Why Are Liquid Staking Cryptocurrencies Seeing Double-Digit Gains? The market structure for DOT remains bullish as the coin managed to flip a few resistance marks into support levels in the past week. A push from the buyers will certainly strengthen the bulls’ efforts to cross the stiff price ceiling of $4.90. The Polkadot price is trading 91% below its all-time high secured in 2021. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was trading at $4.90 at press time. The $4.90 price level was a strong resistance point for the altcoin. Although DOT managed to break past the $4.80 resistance level, which has proven to be a tough resistance mark in the past, the coin continues to remain underneath the $5 level. The $5 mark is crucial, as the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level also somewhere meets the coin at that mark. A push above $5 will take the coin above $5.20. On the other hand, one bearish push and DOT will land at $4.40 and then $4.16. The amount of DOT traded in the last session declined slightly, mirroring the minor downtick in buying strength. Technical Analysis DOT made a significant recovery in buying pressure over the past week. The Relative Strength Index shot above the 60-mark, signifying the chart’s bullishness. Similarly, the asset price moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), which meant buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Polkadot was also inching very close to the 50-SMA line, and just a slight push from buyers would help the price topple over it. A move above the 50-SMA will cause another significant rally for Polkadot. Following the increased demand, the technical indicators pointed towards a buy signal for the coin. This usually means that the coin is headed upward. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates price momentum and reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Records 9% Rise, Why Traders Bet On More Profits The indicator painted green signal bars, which were buy signals for DOT. The Directional Movement Index was positive because the +DI (blue) line was higher than the -DI (orange) line.

The discount to NAV began 2022 in the 20% area, and prior to early 2021 it was the norm for several years for GBTC to trade at an often sizable premium to NAV.  “The GBTC discount compressing may be the product of traders betting on either the complete unwind of the trust or Grayscale being forced to enable full/partial redemptions,” said Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat. “However, it is tough to draw any conclusions just yet since volumes are so low and the market is so illiquid.""  Grayscale had applied to convert the GBTC into an exchange-traded fund that would theoretically provide a path for traders to arbitrage away the discount, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the proposal earlier this year.  Immediately after the decision, Grayscale filed suit against the SEC, arguing that the agency's logic for denying the application was “flawed” and “inconsistently applied."" The case is pending.  Investors in the trust have recently put increasing pressure on Grayscale parent Digital Currency Group (DCG), headed by Barry Silbert, to address the massive discount. There are calls from a number of crypto-sector players for the trust to be liquidated, or at least for Grayscale to allow redemptions, which would allow GBTC investors to quickly realize the full value of their holdings. Hedge fund Fir Tree late last year filed a lawsuit against Grayscale, calling for the company to lower its fees and resume redemptions as a way to narrow the discount.  “Ironically any move towards NAV helps out Barry and the team since it is understood that they have significant GBTC and ETHE holdings, which could be sold for liquidity,"" Farrell said.  Also possibly at work: investor positioning taking place around the start of the year.  Having grown fat in a number of one-way (mostly down) crypto trades last year, traders might be covering some of those bets as 2023 begins. Alongside the move in GBTC to start the year, there have been sizable rallies in the stocks of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and bitcoin miners Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) – all three of which tumbled 75% or more in 2022.

The company recently changed its name from Riot Blockchain to reflect its diversified operation that includes data center hosting and electrical equipment engineering. The next leg higher in shares will depend on a rally in Bitcoin, but we believe shares can outperform to the upside as part of the bullish case. Riot Platforms Inc. ( RIOT ) is one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world with a vertically integrated model that includes hosting services at its data center infrastructure as well as an engineering arm. This is in the crypto sector that got decimated in 2022 as Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) crashed amid the broader market selloff that forced a reset of expectations, particularly in next-gen technologies. Indeed, RIOT is down 90% since hitting a peak valuation near $6 billion at the height of a speculative frenzy going back to early 2021. All that said, we're looking at the company as a crypto winter survivor, highlighting some encouraging operating trends, and setting up what we believe is a turnaround path. The company is ramping up mining production just as Bitcoin prices appear to have stabilized with an ongoing rally off its lows. The potential for stronger earnings and cash flow going forward, supported by a balance sheet with significant liquidity and no debt, highlights why the company is well-positioned to emerge stronger. A recently announced rebranding from the legacy ""Riot Blockchain"" company name opens the door for a fresh start in 2023. RIOT Key Metrics One challenge in the first half of last year was the ""energy crisis"", with record-high electricity rates in Q2 coinciding with extreme volatility in BTC prices. RIOT chose to limit BTC production in July last which briefly became uneconomical for the company in the context of its capacity at the time. By this measure, the core mining operation faced several setbacks last year, reflected in the poor stock price performance. The way to understand this dynamic is that Riot operates several data center facilities tooled for Bitcoin mining. At its Rockdale, Texas location featuring a fixed power block price supply, the company was able to sell power back into the ERCOT grid system at the market spot rate which exceeded its BTC revenue potential, helping to raise cash while reducing overall expenses. source: company IR The setup also played a role in the company's decision to end its co-location hosting agreement with ""Coinmint"" back in July, considering the Massena, New York facility was run through a more prohibitive cost structure. In turn, Riot began a plan to transition all its miners to Texas which benefits from more favorable economics. Fast forward, and the biggest development over the last half-year has been the significant increase in ""hash-rate deployment"" reflecting a greater BTC mining capacity since taking delivery of equipment purchases. From just 3.1 EH/s self-mining capacity at the end of 2021 which remain flat through August, Riot ended 2022 at 9.7 EH/s, per its latest operational update . Current guidance is for that level to reach 12.5 EH/s by the end of Q1 as the Rockdale facility expands with a new building and the company installs more miners. source: company IR The larger scale now means that the mining operations are significantly more valuable and cash flow positive compared to trends during the July 2022 curtailment incident. Lower natural gas prices and normalizing electricity rates in recent months are part of the more encouraging backdrop into 2023 on the cost side. On the other hand, the flexibility to further curtail output depending on market pricing conditions and receive those power credits offered by the operator, if necessary, highlights an advantage of the business model. Riot has built out one of the largest Bitcoin mining infrastructures in the world in Texas, recognized as an attractive jurisdiction. Beyond Rockdale, a new facility in Corsicana, Texas with upwards of 1GW capacity is expected to commence operations by Q4 2023 as part of further capacity growth tailwinds. source: company IR Is RIOT A Good Stock? Understandably, there is a lot of skepticism regarding Bitcoin mining as a business with the industry earning its reputation as the wild west of the stock market, and even more volatile that the price of BTC. Still, it's important to keep in mind that this is an industrial-scale operation that generated $46 million in revenue with the last reported Q3 results , which was in an environment of deeply depressed market pricing as well as lower production that increased materially into Q4. The metrics were looking at starts with RIOT currently commanding a market capitalization of approximately $800 million which includes a balance sheet cash position of $255 million in addition to 6,897 BTC holdings. At the current market price of $17,000 per Bitcoin, that digital asset holding translates to an incremental $117 million in liquidity. In other words, RIOT is trading at just 2x cash which we interpret as cheap for an industry leader that is consolidating market share while smaller players are going under. The near-term financial strategy has been to regularly sell the majority of the company's monthly BTC production as a method of generating cash to fund its ongoing investment spending expanding Rockdale and Corsicana. In December RIOT mined 659 BTC, while selling 600 of the production generating net proceeds of approximately $10.2 million. Again, going back to the company's hash-rate capacity growth chart, there is a path here for the monthly production to climb nearly 30% through Q1. Considering the current Bitcoin network hash rate at 259 EH/s representing the global computing power across all miners, RIOT's current ""market share"" of 3.5% is expected to reach 4.8% by the end of March. Assuming a flat network difficulty over the period, RIOT will be mine upwards of 1,322 BTC per month by the end of Q1 representing an annualized rate of 15,864 Bitcoins. Data by YCharts At a constant price of BTC at $17k, the forecasted March production implies $270 million in year-ahead revenue as a low-end mining estimate. The calculation here is based on the Bitcoin network awarding 328,500 newly minted Bitcoin per year, or 27,375 per month, while RIOT captures 4.83% of the network reward hash rate share at 12.5 EH/s by the end of Q1. The figure ties into a current consensus estimate for RIOT to reach 2023 revenue of $417 million which considers that for 2022, roughly one-third of company revenue YTD through Q3 was based on the peripheral hosting services and the separate electrical equipment engineering business. That breakdown should narrow further as the self-mining segment plays a larger role. Keep in mind there is also an expectation for further deployments into the second half of the year, as the hash rate capacity further grows, on top of the revenues from peripheral segments. source: company IR While GAAP profitability will likely remain elusive in the current BTC pricing environment as the company continues with Capex spending, the expectation is for positive adjusted EBITDA towards $140 million in 2023. At this level, RIOT notes that its stock trading at a 2.3x EV to forward EBITDA multiple is at a discount to industry peers against a group average closer to 8x across names like Hut 8 Mining Corp ( HUT ), Marathon Digital Holdings Inc ( MARA ) and Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc ( GREE ) as comparable miners. The spread here, particularly with MARA reflects an ongoing debate about which business model for Bitcoin miners makes the most sense. The contrast is that RIOT has staked its future on being vertically integrated by owning its data centers, while MARA avoids that capital-intensive investment while simply outsourcing the infrastructure requirement. While the data centers operation may have been a crutch for RIOT in 2022, considering many of its customers faced significant financial difficulties in the BTC pricing environment, we believe its built-out facilities are now a strength as it provides room to expand self-mining operations while adding cash flow diversification. As a stand-alone business, RIOT also believes its data centers segment and engineering group are at a large spread compared to benchmark companies in those industries. source: company IR What's Next For RIOT? Any upside for the RIOT will need BTC to rally from here and sustain more positive momentum going forward. The number of scandals in crypto along with high-profile bankruptcies over the past year has damaged the sector sentiment and added to uncertainties Still, the takeaway for us is that it's business as usual for RIOT with a company that continues to execute a long-term strategy to evolve into the world's leading Bitcoin-driven infrastructure platform. The market pricing for BTC is poor, but our take is that the long-term bullish thesis for BTC including its growing role as an alternative asset and adoption among institutional investors into the space remains alive and well. We have previously written about how the collapse of FTX (FTT-USD) can be positive for Bitcoin by helping to consolidate its role as the ""gold standard"" of crypto. In our view, FTX exposed how smaller alternative cryptocurrencies ""alts"" and tokens, along with unregulated exchanges, are more prone to fraud and scams as the culprit for much of the sector volatility last year. It's encouraging to note that Bitcoin's network has never been the subject of a ""hack"" , while its capped supply adds a measure of intrinsic value based on credibility and scarcity. Favorably, the trading action in BTC has stabilized in recent months. Our call here is that with ""crypto"" representing a high-beta segment of technology, Bitcoin can benefit from a global rally in financial assets through 2023. The recent Dollar weakness based on signs global inflation is trending lower which opens the door for Central Banks to slow down on hawkish rate hikes could be positive for all risk assets. It's worth mentioning that BTC is up almost 20% since hitting a low near $15k in November. source: coinmarketcap .com As it relates to RIOT, one way to look at the operation is that a $1,000 increase (or decrease) to the market price of BTC translates into a $16 million change in annualized mining revenue through its Q1 2023 forecasted run rate. Naturally, the upside here is significant in a bullish case where BTC regains positive momentum and reclaims levels beyond $20k and +$25k as a key level of technical resistance. In this scenario, we would expect RIOT to outperform the price of BTC to the upside based on its operating and financial leverage, while the bullish backdrop in the sector adds a measure of valuation multiples expansion. Earnings would have room to accelerate well above current market estimates while the company would also benefit as its balance sheet position of BTC appreciates. What Are The Risks? On the downside, the level to watch would be $15k in BTC. A break lower would mark a more concerning deterioration of the trading environment that could coincide with renewed financial market volatility. Operating losses and cash flow bleed would also likely accelerate, adding to questions regarding the long-term solvency of the business. Investors also need to keep an eye on regulatory efforts that could limit the trading access or ownership of BTC which are measures under discussion by various governments worldwide. For RIOT, it will be important for the next stages of its operational deployment to move forward including hitting those hash-rate targets without disruptions to its Texas facilities. Weaker-than-expected mining revenues or negative cash flow trends could force a leg lower in shares with a reassessment of the bullish outlook. RIOT Stock Price 2023 We are bullish on RIOT and rate shares as a buy with an initial price target of $7.00 implying a 3x revenue multiple on its current 2023 sales estimate. Starting with a constant BTC price over the near term, we see shares rallying with the market acknowledging the organic growth momentum and production increases through Q1 that have the effect of brushing aside liquidity concerns. Again, RIOT is high-risk, and speculative given the long-term pricing uncertainties of BTC but we like the setup here on a risk-adjusted basis. The stock can work in the context of a more diversified portfolio representing exposure to a unique segment that may still be in the early stages of reaching its potential.

42410877,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsD3x,1673372273,Crypto Industry Hopes Turn to French Legislators as Regulators Back Mandatory License,"Crypto advocates are pinning their hopes on France’s National Assembly, the lower house of the French Parliament, to overturn a legal change they worry could wreck France’s goal of becoming an innovative crypto hub.  Making crypto companies seek mandatory licenses to operate in France raises a number of problems, a key lawmaker has told CoinDesk. However, the legislative plans to order licensing have gained increasing support from regulators seeking to avoid FTX-style collapses.  A surprise amendment agreed by the French Senate in December would mean any crypto company that isn’t registered with the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) by Oct. 1, 2023, would need to seek a license – a more burdensome procedure involving checks on financial resources and business conduct that so far no company has successfully pursued.  “The recent bankruptcy of FTX has put a spotlight on the inherent risk of all investment in cryptoassets, in particular when the company operates outside of any regulation,” Senator Hervé Maurey said in a text submitted alongside his amendment. He added the change will “avoid any misuse of the regulatory framework” as new European Union (EU) rules known as the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) go into effect.  However, his concern may not be shared among lawmakers in the National Assembly, which also needs to agree to the change and whose Finance Committee is due to discuss it next week.  “The solution proposed by the Senate raises difficulties which will have to be looked at closely,” lawmaker Daniel Labaronne said in an email to CoinDesk. “It poses problems of method and of timing.”  “The Senate was right to put this subject on the table,” said Labaronne, who will pen the Committee’s views on behalf of the Assembly ahead of a Jan. 24 plenary discussion, adding that he hopes “to arrive at a more satisfactory arrangement” than the Senate’s.  Maurey appears to be concerned that current arrangements could create a new loophole, offering an incentive for companies to apply for the lighter registration regime – under which regulators check compliance with governance and money laundering norms – to escape more heavy-handed regulation.  Read more: French Financial Regulator Supports Faster Mandatory Licensing for Crypto Firms  MiCA requires crypto providers such as exchanges and wallet companies to be authorized and meet financial stability and consumer protection norms, and is expected to enter into force late 2024 – but those already recognized under a national system such as France’s will get an extra 18 months to comply.  Regulators including the AMF and the French central bank have now supported Maurey’s proposals – but some argue they will be unworkable, damage the economy and run counter to MiCA.  The Senate amendment is “premature,” Emilien Bernard-Alzias, a partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons in Paris, told CoinDesk in a telephone interview. “It’s very bad for the competitiveness of France … it will kill innovation.”  His worry is that, under Maurey’s plans and until MiCA is up and running, crypto firms based in other EU member states could have to seek a duplicate license in France – despite the fact that MiCA is supposed to ensure they can operate across the bloc with a single authorization. In practice, few companies would bother with such a burdensome step, Bernard-Alzias said, and they could end up skipping the French market entirely.  Worse still, the plan could prove administratively impossible. He estimates there’s already a waiting list of 50 applicants in a registration process that takes at least a year.  “The AMF will never succeed in treating all these dossiers before the deadline,” he said, describing the process as “already very long and very complex.”  The AMF did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment on its administrative capacity or the size of the backlog.  For Faustine Fleuret, president of crypto advocacy group ADAN, the change is a “bad omen” for the sector – and fails to take account of existing hiccups in the system.  Rather than hounding those based in the country, there needs to be tougher action against foreign noncompliant firms, she said, alongside improvements to licensing conditions that are impossible to meet in practice – such as the duty to have insurance that the market doesn't yet provide.  “Authorities have to understand the importance of developing the sector in France,” Fleuret said in a telephone interview. “If you want to keep jobs, talent and our digital sovereignty, it’s that we have to defend.”  “We are very disappointed the amendment was adopted in the Senate,” she said.  But, she adds, she was heartened that the government attempted to oppose the move – and that an increased awareness of and support for the sector could lead to a better-founded discussion in the Assembly.

Liquid staking cryptocurrencies have been receiving more attention ever since the announcement that the Ethereum “Shanghai” upgrade is likely to take place in March 2023. This upgrade is important for the network because it will mean that staked ETH will finally be withdrawable. Related Reading: This Sub-$1 Billion Crypto Is Leading Market Gains, Here’s The Reason Anticipation around this upgrade is already on the rise and liquid staking tokens are enjoying a good portion of this attention. Their popularity comes from the fact that they allow stakers to earn a yield on staked ETH even though they can’t withdraw their ETH. It also makes it possible for stakers to have tokens on hand which they can deploy on other protocols to further participate in the ecosystem. Liquid staking protocols reward stakers with ETH-pegged tokens such as stETH and ankrETH and make it possible for ETH users to stake without having to become validators themselves. But instead of having to rely on centralized exchanges to do this, as was previously the case, these DeFi protocols are decentralized. ETH price crosses $1,300 ahead of Shanghai upgrade | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The higher earning potential of staking with liquid staking protocols has led to more demand for them. With the Shanghai upgrade coming, it is expected that more ETH will be moved to these protocols, leading to more demand for their native cryptocurrencies. The Largest Liquid Staking Protocols The largest liquid staking protocol in the space now is currently Lido Finance. It accounts for around 30% of the total 15 million staked ETH, making it an important contender in the space. Its native LDO token has a market cap of $1.6 billion and its price is up 57% in the last 7 days. Lido is the largest liquid staking protocol | Source: CryptoSlate Next in line is Frax Share whose price is up 21% in the last week. The digital asset’s market cap is almost $403 million, rewarding users with frxETH for their staked ETH at an 8% APR. This is the highest APR of any liquid staking protocol.

But in terms of ETH deposited, it is one of the highest, accounting for around 6.5% of the total market share. Others include Ankr Protocol which is up 26% in 7 days, as well as Stafi, pStake Finance, and StakeWise, all of which are up 32%, 20%, and 10%, respectively, in the same time period.

""2022 was a grand washout for growth stocks and crypto,"" Novogratz told CNBC, but added that ""crypto is not going away."" To support his argument, the high-profile cryptocurrency investor highlighted the fact that the price of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) have increased more than 6% and nearly 3% past five days, respectively, indicating some tentative moves back into the space. This came after the crypto industry was hammered in 2022 by high costs and low revenues, regulatory headwinds and a chain of macro events, he said. While warning that ""there are still overhangs"" in the market, especially uncertainty surrounding DCG, Genesis and Gemini ""that will play out in the next quarter,"" Novogratz also suggested that the troubles over the past 12 months have also clarified conditions. ""It is a clean market right now,"" he said. Asked about the impacts of Genesis and Gemini bankruptcy, Novogratz said that to survive in 2023 transition period, Galaxy Digital ( OTCPK:BRPHF ) is leaning wherever possible, either through recently bought mining facility in Texas or acquisition of self-custody company GK8 in Israel, to ""catch the uptick"" in the crypto market. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) suffered a massive decline of more than 60% in 2022, hurt in recent months by the fall of crypto exchange FTX. In Tuesday's trading, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was sitting around $17.3K, +0.3% on the day. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) was at $1,334, -0.10%.

7359245,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515607,1673369894,"Ethereum Price Records 9% Rise, Why Traders Bet On More Profits","The Ethereum price has been trending to the upside over the past week as the general sentiment in the market improves. The second crypto by market capitalization could extend its gains if macroeconomic conditions continue to support the rally. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bullish Signal: Whale Withdraws $34.7M In SHIB From Binance As of this writing, the Ethereum price trades at $1,333 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency records a 10% profit and stands as one of the best performers in the top 10 by market cap. Ethereum Price Follows Market Sentiment According to a report from analysis firm Blofin, the market sentiment has improved based on widespread reports about an economic recession. These expectations of worse financial data could force the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to loosen its monetary policy. The financial institution has been hiking interest rates to put a hold on the highest inflation recorded in decades. As a result, the global market is suffering. If conditions decay too much, the market believes the Fed will backtrack, allowing Ethereum and other risk assets to rally. Today, the Fed will provide further light on its next steps; if it slows down, the Ethereum price will likely continue on its bullish trajectory. The positive expectations are spilling to other crypto financial sectors. According to Blofin, there have been positive developments in the futures and options sectors. The firm noted the shift in sentiment for Q1, 2023, compared to Q4, 2022: A rebound of expectation is also underway. In the futures market, the positive basis term structure has been maintained for some time. Although the futures’ basis is still around the parity level, Investors’ implicit expectations are not pessimistic as they were in 2022q4. Crypto Market To See More Volatility A decline in the U.S. dollar supports the bullish continuation of the Ethereum price. As measured by the DXY Index (DXY), the currency is re-testing critical support allowing ETH and other risk-on assets to appreciate. However, the decline in the DXY hints at a spike in the crypto market’s Volatility. According to Blofin: It is worth noting that the implied Volatility of front-month BTC options has increased somewhat. As the Dec CPI data is about to be released, the game between investors in the spot and derivatives markets may further increase the implied Volatility. Implied Volatility measures future price movement for an asset. The analytic firm believes that the short-term metrics point to the upside, but the mid to long-term still shows “a relatively bearish attitude.” Related Reading: Why The VIX Could Predict A 20% Bitcoin And Crypto Rally Options traders are accumulating calls (long positions) for BTC with an expiration date set for January 27.

The lawsuit alleged that the crypto trader in October 2022 manipulated the price of swaps contracts offered by decentralized digital asset exchange Mango Markets, culminating in the misappropriation of $114M. Eisenberg was said to have been arrested last month by the U.S. Department of Justice in Puerto Rico on fraud charges.

The inflated value of the swaps were then used as collateral to borrow and withdraw $114M from Mango Markets in the form of stablecoins USD Coin ( USDC-USD ) and tether ( USDT-USD ) and other digital assets, which were derived from other investor's deposits. The regulator is requiring Eisenberg to pay a civil monetary penalty and is also seeking trading bans.

Possible future market catalysts for crypto include industry restructuring, government regulation, and industry bankruptcies. Most Layer-1 smart contract platforms underperformed Bitcoin & Ethereum in December as investors sold what they could to fund redemptions amidst the overall industry deleveraging. NFTs experienced a nice uptick in volume this past month, with total trading across all chains growing 25% compared to November. December was a rough month for growth stocks and digital assets. Possible future market catalysts for crypto include industry restructuring, government regulation, and industry bankruptcies. December was another tough month for both growth stocks and digital assets as Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) fell 3%, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) -7%, the Nasdaq Composite -9%, and the MVIS Smart Contract Leaders Index -17%. Notably, Bitcoin's 30-day volatility is now lower than S&P 500 volatility. We think that’s unsustainable. Possible upside catalysts include a pre-packaged DCG/Genesis bankruptcy or restructuring with new equity financing, an announcement from Saudi Arabia formalizing Bitcoin mining, regulation & licenses, or a Ripple (XRP-USD) court victory or settlement. Possible downside catalysts include a disorderly DCG bankruptcy, CFIUS blocking BinanceUS’s acquisition of $1B of Voyager crypto assets, hot inflation prints, or a Ripple loss. On the positive side, we also note the recent strength of the Chinese RMB amidst a CCP U-turn on COVID-19 and other redistributive policies. Historically, sturdier relative economic performance in China has coincided with a strong RMB, less onerous capital controls, and resilient BTC. We think this correlation is something to watch this year. CNY vs. BTC (inverted): Falling Lines = Strengthening Sources: Bloomberg as of 12/31/2022. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Lastly, as we hope for better digital assets performance in 2023, we would like to highlight three “huge” opportunities that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin mentioned in a recent blog: Mass wallet adoption : The development of wallets that are easy for everyday people to use and capable of onboarding billions of users. Inflation-resistant stablecoins: The creation of stablecoins that can withstand all types of conditions, including hyperinflation, and are globally accessible. Ethereum-powered website logins: Technical developments that enable Ethereum to take login powers away from centralized monopolies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter and capture more market dominance on internet-based applications. As Vitalik wrote in the piece: “These are all problems that can be solved, and there is a strong drive to solve them. Rollup technology is rapidly scaling to solve scalability, and transactions already get included much more quickly on-chain than they did three years ago.” Digital Asset Market Cap 7 Days 30 days 90 days 365 days Bitcoin $319.53B -1.63% -3.01% -14.62% -64.95% Ethereum $146.76B -1.95% -7.45% -10.07% -67.87% Digital Asset Index Market Cap 7 Days 30 days 90 days 365 days MVIS ® CryptoCompare Infrastructure Application Leaders $12.57B -4.00% -20.50% -21.19% -78.47% MarketVector™ Centralized Exchanges $43.72B 0.32% -16.72% -17.96% -58.95% MVIS ® CryptoCompare Decentralized Finance Leaders $5.96B -5.20% -14.52% -27.30% -81.01% MVIS ® CryptoCompare Smart Contract Leaders $181.63B -3.82% -14.81% -33.92% -82.55% MVIS ® CryptoCompare Media & Entertainment Leaders $3.88B -8.77% -23.78% -48.22% -91.53% Sources: Bloomberg, Messari, CryptoCompare, MVIS, VanEck research as of 12/31/2022. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Smart Contract Platforms: Most Layer-1 smart contract platforms underperformed Bitcoin & Ethereum in December as investors sold what they could to fund redemptions amidst the overall industry deleveraging. Specifically, the continued fallout from the FTX fraud, multiple Bitcoin miner bankruptcies, and the solvency issues at DCG’s lending entity Genesis presented both fundamental and liquidity-based headwinds. Still, despite negative news related to both macroeconomics and digital assets, some key Layer-1s remained remarkably resilient. The top performers for the month, among leading smart contract platforms, included Internet Computer (ICP) +5.3% and Ethereum (ETH) -7.5% The ICP has seen positive price action as the pace of smart contract deployment, called canisters, has accelerated to 16.6% month-to-month in December. Another positive catalyst has been the long-awaited launch of an asset bridge that connects the Ethereum network to the Internet Computer (ICP-USD) network. Still, the positive price performance was not accompanied by rising volumes. Thus, ICP was dropped from the MVIS Smart Contract Leaders Index for falling under the $25M/day level required for inclusion. Ethereum remains the dominant L1 as network usage has remained robust and even grew by some measures in December. For example, unique daily Ethereum ERC-20 users, or wallets that sent an ERC-20 token, have increased by 4.5% on a 30-day moving average basis compared to November. Likewise, L2 settlement activity on Ethereum increased by 13.7% between October and November and a further 7.7% between November and December. Unique Daily Ethereum ERC-20 Users Source: Etherscan as of 12/31/2022. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Among the worst performers in Layer 1 protocols were Algorand ( ALGO-USD ) -31% and Solana ( SOL-USD ) -29.9%. Despite the excitement around Algorand’s yearly conference held at the end of November, Decipher, Algorand’s daily average transactions fell 25% in December compared to November, while average TVL dropped 29%. Despite the chain’s position as FIFA’s “official blockchain partner,” Algo holders saw the World Cup as a ‘sell the news’ event. Algorand 30 Days Moving Average TVL Source: DeFIllama as of 12/31/2022. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Solana continued to dramatically underperform its peers due largely to a decline in usership, network activity, TVL, and selling pressure related to the FTX bankruptcy. Compared to November, total Solana daily active users fell 14.3%, while Solana DeFi daily active users fell 27%, leading to TVL falling 53%. The once popular NFT application StepN has seen its inflow of SOL reverse to outflows. Additionally, major Solana NFT projects such as DeGods and y00ts have left the Solana blockchain to Ethereum and Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), respectively. Even with the decline in developers and developer activity, Solana still boasts more developer activity than Polygon, but with a market cap 30% smaller. We expect fundamental momentum to improve in 2023 thanks to still-resilient NFT activity, a rebirth of some DeFi activities driven by projects like Hero & Friktion , and promising new applications such as Hivemapper , a community-owned Google Maps competitor, which is bootstrapping its network on the Solana Layer 1 chain and using Helium (another Solana-based decentralized infrastructure provider) to provide GPS backup location.

Meanwhile, Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions continue to operate in a league of their own in terms of user adoption momentum: Optimism ((OP)) had more than a 20x increase in daily active users since the beginning of the year, with 590k active users in December. Arbitrum’s growth peaked in November at around 660k active users (almost 10x the number of users in January). Optimism (OP-USD) was also the leader in TVL growth, with a 2x increase in TVL since January. Optimism now has $615 million locked in its DeFi ecosystem. Arbitrum and Polygon have $1.11 and $1.16 billion, respectively, in value locked. Monthly Active Users Growth (100 = 1/1/22) Source: tokenterminal as of 12/31/2022. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Polygon has recently become the Layer 2 choice for an impressive number of globally recognized traditional brands and platforms looking to expand into web3 and NFTs (including companies such as Starbucks ( SBUX ), Meta ( META ), and Reddit ( REDDIT )). In December, Donald Trump's NFTs on Polygon broke daily volume records for the chain. Layer 2 solutions’ main appeal is low transaction fees. In that regard, Arbitrum and Optimism have performed fairly well. Dune Analytics data suggested that the fees on both layer 2 solutions have plunged substantially. They are set to benefit from even lower fees after the implementation of EIP-4844 or ‘Proto-Danksharding’ on Ethereum. The upgrade should introduce data availability for rollups, leading to reduced fees and more transaction throughput, opening doors to new use cases like those promised by Vitalik above.

DeFi: The MVIS DeFi Leaders Index (MVDEFI) fell 14.52% in December, outperforming other categories we track. THORChain’s RUNE ( RUNE-USD ) outperformed, falling only 4%. THORChain is a layer 1, cross-chain, decentralized exchange ((DEX)) built on the cosmos (ATOM-USD) SDK. The protocol acts as a middle layer that allows users to swap native assets on different blockchains. For example, THORChain allows Ethereum holders to swap ETH they hold in their Ethereum wallet and receive AVAX in their Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) wallet. This cross-chain transaction saves users the hassles and fees of sending assets to and trading on centralized exchanges while avoiding the security pitfalls of wrapped assets. Such a transaction is similar to being able to directly trade NYSE Coca-Cola ( KO ) shares for CME soybean futures without having to send money between or make trades on either exchange. THORChain is similar to other DEXes, where liquidity providers lock liquidity in each asset's respective liquidity pool. These liquidity pools are utilized to swap between various assets. Where THORChain differs is that it coordinates the trading of assets not on one blockchain but across blockchains allowing the traders to always hold native assets rather than wrapped assets. Wrapped assets are synthetic representations of assets that are created when a blockchain-to-blockchain ""bridge"" locks a native asset in the bridge's smart contract on a source chain and mints a representation of the locked asset on the destination blockchain. These assets, called ""non-native"" or ""wrapped"" assets, are bearer assets backed by the locked assets on the source chain and can be considered a derivative whose price may differ from the original asset based on supply and demand on the destination chain. They are riskier than native assets because if the bridge is hacked and the hacker unlocks the asset on the source chain, then the synthetic asset is worthless. Most blockchain bridges bring assets that only exist on one chain and create a minted representation on another chain by communicating to each blockchain that the backing assets of the minted assets are locked. When a user wants to bring back the bridged assets to the source chain, he utilizes the bridge, which destroys the synthetic asset on the destination chain and unlocks the source asset on the chain of origin. THORChain, by contrast, does not mint synthetic assets based on locked native assets. Rather, it allows a user to exchange one asset that is native to the source chain for an asset that is native to the destination chain. While this eliminates the risk posed by wrapped assets and bridge hacks, it introduces new risks to liquidity providers whose assets could be stolen if THORChain is hacked. THORChain also does not allow users to introduce native assets from one blockchain to a new blockchain. It simply arranges trades across chains which are best classified as a cross-chain liquidity protocol rather than an actual ""bridge."" We believe the volatility of RUNE in the past month and a half can be attributed to the launch of “Savers Vaults” in mid-November. Savers Vaults are a new way to supply single-asset liquidity on THORChain. Users can deposit native Bitcoin, earn in-kind yield, and withdraw their principal at any time. Savers Vaults are available for Layer 1 assets supported by THORChain: BTC, ETH, BNB, BCH, DOGE, LTC, ATOM, and AVAX. There are currently 1705 savers with $8.8 million in value locked. The mean APR across all assets is 7.26% - so far, savers have earned $61k in total since launch. We also believe some market participants may be rallying around THORChain thanks to the endorsement of prominent Bitcoin OG Erik Vorhees, who famously out-debated SBF on the “Bankless” podcast two weeks before FTX imploded. Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) was the second-best performer relative to the sector, down 14%. Despite the poor performance of UNI and DeFi coins overall, the protocol has had quite a positive and key role this year, sporting record volumes and taking market share amidst the general distrust in centralized exchanges that ravaged the digital assets market in 2022. For the year, Uniswap had 410k active users on average every month. From those, 44% were new users (first trade of the year), 36% were retained users (active every month), and 20% used the platform at least in 2022 (non-frequent repeat users). Uniswap has done a good job attracting new users given market conditions in crypto this year. But most of its revenue is derived from repeat users. With a 36% monthly retention rate, the protocol benefits from retained users as they drive a huge portion of the fees and trading volume on the DEX. In an effort to drive more adoption, Uniswap in December partnered with fintech company Moonpay to allow users to buy cryptocurrency on its web app using debit cards, credit cards, and bank transfers. The bank transfer option is being rolled out for users within most U.S. states, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and the Single Euro Payments Area, also known as SEPA. In the announcement made on Dec. 20, Uniswap shared that its users will now be able to convert fiat to cryptocurrency on the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, and Artibrum.

Infra: The MVIS Infra index fell 20.5%, underperforming other digital assets sectors. The Graph’s GRT ( GRT-USD ) was the best performer in the sector, down 7%, followed by Polygon’s MATIC (-15%) and Quant Network’s QNT ( QNT-USD ) (-16%). The Graph Network ((GRT)) allows developers to search, index, and publish data from public blockchains. The protocol enables developers to browse through APIs, referred to as subgraphs. The amount of such subgraphs increased 116% this year, and active indexers increased 80%, currently at 290 as of December 30th. Filecoin’s FIL ( FIL-USD ) was the worst performer in sector, down 33%. Filecoin lets users rent out or sell spare storage space on their computers in exchange for the network's native token. Filecoin says it has a capacity of 15.34 exbibytes, or 17.6 million terabytes, but lists storage of OpenSea NFT metadata as one of its primary use cases, raising questions about how much of its storage network is truly utilized. Meanwhile, on OpenSea, monthly volume dropped to $159 million in December from around $4.8 billion at the start of the year, a decline of about 97%. Filecoin peaked at $236 when it listed on April 1 but trades at $3 today.

Metaverse: NFTs experienced a nice uptick in volume this past month, with total trading across all chains growing 25% compared to November. Polygon stood out among the major blockchains last month as the Trump Digital Trading Card collection sold all 45k NFTs in less than a day and accounted for over 60% of the NFT volume on Polygon in December. Additionally, one of the most prominent NFT communities on Solana, y00ts, announced they would be bridging the project over to Polygon. A project of this scale has never bridged chains before and, if done successfully, could spur other NFT projects to contemplate switching blockchains if they think it is in the community's best interest. December also welcomed NFT traders with a new aggregator from Uniswap that facilitated about $3.7 million in volume in its first month. Uniswap’s aggregator utilizes NFT prices from all of the top NFT marketplaces to provide traders with the best prices on nonfungible digital assets. Despite dominating ERC-20 decentralized exchange volume, Uniswap’s NFT aggregator only routed less than 1% of total NFT volume in December. Metaverse tokens performed significantly worse than their land counterparts in December. MANA and SAND prices dropped by 24% and 31%, respectively, while the average land sale price for these projects increased 3% and fell by 7%. Meanwhile, APE only fell 2% throughout the last month and the average Otherdeed sold for 22% more than in November. Despite the launch of APE staking, the token price has performed surprisingly well as investors appear to be holding their APE in anticipation of the next Otherside metaverse trip announced on the 22nd. In the lead-up to the last Otherside interactive experience, APE price rallied impressively, suggesting savvy APE stakers may be waiting for a similar pump before they sell staking rewards. Web3 gaming activity also declined in December, as the games we track saw a reduction in monthly users by about 10% compared to November. On the hardware side of the metaverse, CCS Insights reported that worldwide shipments of VR and AR headsets decreased 12% year over year to 9.6 million. While this isn’t a positive statistic for metaverse or gaming growth, the decline can partially be attributed to inflation-driven price increases and a lack of product offerings. In 2023, multiple new headsets will come to market from players such as Sony and Apple that will potentially reinvigorate consumer interest in VR and AR devices.

Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. The value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency disappear. Cryptocurrencies are not covered by either FDIC or SIPC insurance. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of cryptocurrency. Investing in cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future. Investors should conduct extensive research into the legitimacy of each individual cryptocurrency, including its platform, before investing. The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of the specific cryptocurrency may be complex, technical, or difficult to understand or evaluate. The cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or operation, including attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of the cryptocurrency’s blockchain or other underlying technology. Some cryptocurrency transactions will be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that a transaction may have been initiated. Investors must have the financial ability, sophistication and willingness to bear the risks of an investment and a potential total loss of their entire investment in cryptocurrency. An investment in cryptocurrency is not suitable or desirable for all investors. Cryptocurrency has limited operating history or performance.

42411280,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glManG,1673365435,Now I Know the Cryptocurrency Industry Is Here to Stay,"As a long-time crypto skeptic, it may seem odd that I am helping organize a digital assets conference at Duke University on Jan. 20-21. After all, I once wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed calling for a cryptocurrency ban. While I continue to believe that unbacked cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, provide no economic utility and impose societal costs that vastly outweigh the benefits, I also recognize that the broader digital asset industry is not going away.  Lee Reiners is policy director at the Duke Financial Economics Center and a lecturing fellow at Duke Law. At Duke, he teaches cryptocurrency law and policy and is a frequent media commentator on cryptocurrency regulation. To learn more about Digital Assets at Duke and to register, see here.  How do I know this? Well, for starters I have been teaching and writing about cryptocurrency and digital assets at Duke for over six years. During this time, the sector continuously evolved and defied all predictions, including mine. This history suggests that those arguing the ongoing crypto winter signals the death knell of crypto will similarly be proven wrong.  I have also spoken with countless Duke students from across campus, including students in our groundbreaking Master of Engineering in Financial Technology program, who are passionate about digital assets and blockchain technology and want to make a career out of it. These students are not motivated by a desire to make a quick buck or buy a Lambo; rather, they find the subject matter intellectually engaging and see an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a still nascent industry with great potential.  Finally, I know digital assets are here to stay because leading figures and firms from the traditional financial system say so.  Writing in the Wall Street Journal last month, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that he sees “blockchain as a promising technology” that is already changing how corporations raise money and how investors trade stocks. As evidence, he cites Goldman’s use of blockchain in client-to-client trading platforms and its underwriting of a two-year, 100 million euro digital bond for the European Investment Bank with two other banks, all based on a private blockchain.  Read more: BlackRock CEO’s Crypto About-Face  Also last month, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that “the next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities.” We have already seen several high-profile examples of tokenization. Last summer, JPMorgan’s Onyx Digital Assets blockchain-based network transferred tokenized shares in a BlackRock money market fund; in September, private equity giant KKR tokenized shares of a feeder fund for the main KKR health-care fund.  These developments may be a far cry from the “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash” envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto, but they are not nothing. Technology and industries evolve as consumers begin to use the product and express their preferences, and as policymakers adjust the regulatory framework to account for new risks. Despite the strident belief among many that crypto represents a new monetary system untethered from central banks and legacy financial institutions, crypto was destined to evolve, with its underlying technology adopted by the same institutions it was supposed to render obsolete.  As we stand in the ashes of the FTX implosion, now is the perfect time to take stock of crypto’s ongoing evolution and look over the horizon to the potential digital asset use cases that will provide genuine economic utility for the long term. This is why my colleagues and I are hosting Digital Assets at Duke this month.  Digital Assets at Duke is not your typical crypto conference. There will be no sports cars parked out front, no nightclub afterparties and no vendor halls with free swag. Instead, we will harness Duke’s strength in interdisciplinary research and industry collaboration to convene key players in the digital assets industry, regulatory experts, and select researchers for two days of rigorous debate and discussion.  Perhaps no issue is more critical to the future path of digital assets than regulation, and we’ll be hearing from representatives of the two federal agencies at the forefront of this debate. Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner Hester Peirce has consistently criticized what she considers the agency’s “regulation by enforcement” approach to digital assets and has proposed an innovative safe harbor proposal that would provide developers of decentralized networks with a three-year grace period from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Kristin Johnson was a distinguished securities and derivatives law scholar prior to joining the CFTC in 2022. While there, Johnson has repeatedly called for “a whole-of-government or comprehensive regulatory regime to ensure effective customer protections in digital asset markets.”  Stablecoins are one digital asset use case that may potentially reduce current frictions in our payments system and facilitate new transaction models like programmable money and micropayments. Our conference will feature speakers from two leading stablecoin issuers that utilize different business and regulatory models. Circle, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, has a money transmitter license in most U.S. states and the company’s leadership has expressed a desire to become a commercial bank. Circle also recently announced a partnership with BlackRock to move 80% of USDC reserves to a government-only money market mutual fund created by BlackRock, a proposal that has drawn the ire of banking groups. The USDF Consortium is taking a different approach to its yet-to-be issued USDF stablecoin by restricting consortium membership to FDIC-insured banks and working with Figure to issue tokenized deposits on the Provenance blockchain.  The collapse of FTX and other centralized crypto firms over the past year has led to renewed calls by crypto supporters for a return to crypto’s decentralized roots and an embrace of decentralized finance (DeFi). As noted in a recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York blog post, “DeFi protocols appear to have continued to function as intended in 2022 and no protocols have been closed down.” Our conference will dissect DeFi’s performance over the past year and DeFi’s future growth potential in panels on decentralized exchanges and DeFi applications beyond exchanges.  Digital Assets at Duke also features panels on tokenization, central bank digital currency, security and institutional adoption. In sum, the conference will bring together the people and companies that are focused on the development, delivery and regulation of the next-generation digital asset environment.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Lee Reniers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/10/now-i-know-the-cryptocurrency-industry-is-here-to-stay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d22c6e91a0746bc132320fc5c3f831ba2510c5d2-8256x5504.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411042,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBDw6,1673364442,"The Macroeconomic Crypto Climate, Explained","Over the summer, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital failed shortly after the collapse of UST, the stablecoin project led by Do Kwon, who promised that a token called LUNA would help its stablecoin, worth tens of billions of dollars at the time, maintain parity with the U.S. dollar. The whole thing unraveled when investors lost confidence in the mechanism, bringing financial ruin to companies exposed to the coin. Then, as the crypto winter set in, another set of companies, among them CoinDesk sister company Genesis and BlockFi, went into crisis mode after the behemothic crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy protection after a CoinDesk article exposed a huge hole in FTX’s finances.  The cascading collapses were spurred on by a tough macroeconomic climate. The founder of stablecoin FRAX, for instance, pins the collapse of UST to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes. “The real reason this is happening is more of a dollar liquidity crisis and dollar purchasing power rising against all assets,” he told crypto publication The Defiant in May. “When Fed rates rise, liquidity … gets sucked out [of everything and put] into U.S. Treasurys as the risk-free rate rises.”  The macro-economy works in cycles of boom and bust, and it’s pretty clear that the world is in the latter right now. In the boom times, interest rates are low, providing cheap cash to startups that want to raise money. Only last year the venture capital market was “just insane,” Waltter Kulvik, a partner at U.K. law firm Eversheds Sutherland, told Fortune. It was easy to score investments for anything related to crypto because the money was so easy to come by and loans were cheap. Crypto merger and acquisition deal activity in 2021 hit $9.9 billion, the highest on record, and VCs invested $32.8 billion.  All that happened around the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, when central banks worldwide pumped money into the economy like never before. They did so in an attempt to offset the stagnation caused by the coronavirus, which kept everyone inside their homes and away from factories, shops and office desks. In crypto, that coincided with an all-time high for bitcoin, as well as the launch of some highly speculative non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects.  But prices can’t go up and to the right forever, and the debt began to accrue. Consider how the largest bitcoin miner in North America, Core Scientific, took on a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.58 in April 2022 – a particularly high value given that, as Jaran Mellerud of Hashrate Index wrote, “Bitcoin mining is an exceptionally volatile industry with deep bear cycles that can last very long.”  At the same time, inflation began to rise, and central banks started to hike interest rates – once close to zero – right back up to pre-pandemic levels to prevent their currencies from devaluing due to all the money they had printed. That made loans expensive, preventing crypto companies from continuing to use cheap money to prop up their operations.  When central banks pushed hard on the brakes, a lot of money came out of risky investments and back into safer ones. As investors withdrew their risk, pandemic stocks such as Peloton crashed, as did the “meme” stocks that furnished the height of the 2021 bull markets, including GameStop and AMC. No wonder, then, that plenty of crypto companies defaulted.  Then, in 2022, tech companies – most of them little more than speculative bets on other transformative technologies, started to lay off their staff as stock prices fell. Facebook, which rebranded in late 2021 to Meta Platforms at the height of the metaverse craze, laid off 11,000 of its staff in November 2022, or 13% of its workforce. So did crypto companies, which became leaner operations after growing too quickly.  And so, now the economy lies in its latest downtown. It’s not just the U.S.; China is going through its own days of reckoning after its housing market overheated. These cycles of boom and bust are commonplace in the financial markets, and are a feature of any capitalist system.  This cycle happened last in 2008, when bull market excess triggered a banking collapse in the U.S. financial system. Back then, venture capital fund Sequoia Capital declared “RIP Good Times,” and had to wait several years for the next market upswing. And before then, 2001, and so on and so on. The National Bureau of Economic Research found 34 economic cycles between 1854 and 2020, with each rotation taking an average of 4.6 years.  Ray Dalio, of Bridgewater Associates, said in “The Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail” that nation-states have their own boom and busts, and that those cycles can take hundreds of years. Put that way, crypto’s craziness last year, and its destruction this year, is just a footnote in the latest edition of bull market excess.

VIX was created to quantify market expectations of volatility for the S&P 500. In doing so, the VIX is future oriented, meaning that it only shows the implied volatility for the next 30 days. The rule of thumb is: if the VIX increases, the S&P 500 is likely to decrease, and if the VIX value decreases, the S&P 500 is likely to remain stable or increase. Fundstrat Analyst Expects A 20% S&P 500 Rally In 2023 Lee expects a 20% rally for the S&P 500 this year. Why? According to the chief analyst, inflation surprised the Fed on the downside last year. This year, it will be the other way around. Inflation will fall faster than the Fed recently forecasted. This will have a decisive impact on the VIX, which will decline in value. “The bond market volatility is below its 200 day [average]. If that happens to the VIX, we would be at 17,” Lee claims and continues to say that “since the 1950s, following a negative year, if the VIX is lower on average than the prior year, we are up an average of 22%. So I think we are set up for a 20% year.” Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Data Shows Weak Baseline For 2023: Report According to the Fundstrat analyst, Thursday will be very telling. If the core CPI is again below consensus, that means the original Fed forecast of 4.8% for PCE is 60 basis points too high. “And that means inflation is undershooting by a huge margin. The bond market is gonna push the Fed to say that February might be the last hike and after that it cuts,” Lee asserts. Why @fundstrat says stocks could rally more than 20% this year, despite the latest #Fedspeak pic.twitter.com/fToibbPp2W — CNBCOvertime (@CNBCOvertime) January 9, 2023 What Does This Matter For Bitcoin? For bitcoin, the prediction of Thomas Lee is interesting in that the price had a high correlation with the S&P 500 (with a higher beta) over the past year, unless there were crypto-intrinsic shocks like the collapse of FTX or Terra Luna. This meant that the bitcoin price behaved very similarly to the S&P 500, but was more volatile in both directions in response to changes in the market. Related Reading: Why Justin Sun’s Stablecoin USDD Is Struggling To Maintain Its Dollar Peg To that extent, the VIX (currently standing at 22) can also be used as a sentiment barometer for bitcoin. If Lee’s predicted drop in the VIX to 17 actually occurs – either as a result of positive CPI data or a pivot by the U.S. Federal Reserve – BTC could see a rally towards $20,000. As recently as November, Lee said he was sticking to his bitcoin price forecast of $200,000, even if the current market is negative. According to him, the BTC price will rise in tandem with the S&P 500 if there are no more scams and bankruptcies of key players in the crypto industry. At press time, the bitcoin price was showing a slight uptrend over the past week, trading at $17,296.

Now crypto investment collective PleasrDAO is pivoting to host virtual live auctions with the creation of PleasrHouse, the group said Tuesday.  Its inaugural sale this Thursday will feature a non-fungible token (NFT) created in collaboration with whistleblower Edward Snowden, political activist Daniel Ellsberg and The Freedom of the Press Foundation, which was teased in a tweet by PleasrDAO saying, “The revolutionaries will be televised.”  PleasrDAO, a group of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT traders, first made news in June 2021 when the group purchased a fraction of the popular Doge NFT for $4 million, which grew to a valuation of $225 million by September of that year. In 2021, it purchased convicted pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli’s sole edition of the Wu-Tang Clan’s “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin” album.  As the DAO is shifting to hosting its own sales of these items, Jamis Johnson, chief pleasing officer at PleasrDAO, told CoinDesk it aims to facilitate sales with on-chain transactions, affording users frictionless participation in the auction. In a press release, PleasrDAO described PleasrHouse as “a new experiment created to disrupt the shared experience of live art auctions” that will focus on exploring the importance of unique art through interviews and other media.  The premier NFT on sale is titled, “Wouldn’t You Go To Prison To End This War?”, the words Ellsberg said just after he surrendered to officials for leaking the ""Pentagon Papers"" in 1971. The token features the video of the interview with the Pentagon Papers superimposed on it. Proceeds of the sale will be donated to the Freedom of the Press Foundation and the Daniel Ellsberg Initiative for Peace and Democracy.  “They were fighting for freedom of information being available to the public. And I think that that's kind of at the core of the ethos of crypto, to not allow ourselves to be limited by the government, right?” said Johnson. “Those two concepts are very adjacent.”",POSITIVE,없음,SPONSORED,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/10/the-revolutionaries-will-be-televised-pleasrdao-launching-live-auctions-with-snowden-ellsberg-nft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98a8c171bf687e9f8e1e4419f4711aadc4a88f85-1056x792.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shiba Inu Whale Transfers Out 4,000,000,000,000 SHIB From Binance As per data from the crypto transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive Shiba Inu transfer has taken place during the past day. This transaction involved the movement of 4,000,000,000,000 SHIB on the Ethereum blockchain, worth about $34.7 million at the time of the transfer. Since the transaction here is so large, it’s likely that the entity behind it was a whale. Sometimes, movements from this cohort can have visible impacts on the market due to the sheer scale involved in them. But how the price would respond to their moves depends on what their intention was with the transfer in question. Here are some additional details surrounding this Shiba Inu whale transaction that may help form a more complete picture regarding the intent behind it: This massive SHIB transfer seems to have only taken a fee of $1.44 to go through on the Ethereum blockchain | Source: Whale Alert As you can see above, the sending address for this transfer was a wallet affiliated with the crypto exchange Binance, while the destination of these coins was a wallet attached to the SHIB Staking service. Staking is a process that involves investors locking a number of tokens into a contract for some duration of time and earning some rewards for it in return. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In Yet? Here’s What aSOPR Metric Suggests Since the Shiba Inu whale moved this massive stack from an exchange (which investors keep coins on to prepare for dumping) to this staking contract, it’s likely that this humongous investor plans to hold onto these coins for an extended period. This would suggest that the whale is bullish on the prospects of the meme coin at the moment. Such HODLing conviction could prove to be constructive for the price itself in the long term. Also, in the past day, the 100 biggest Ethereum whales have also gone around shopping for SHIB, as data from WhaleStats displays below. Naturally, such accumulation from the whales is also a positive sign for the asset’s value.

Usually, some whales try to dump while they can during profit-taking opportunities like now (thus providing impedance to the rally in the process), but as they have been accumulating instead, it shows that they believe this rally could go on a while still, and thus further provides evidence of their conviction in the coin.

Bitcoin Exchange Inflows & Outflows Continue To Decline As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC inflow volumes are now only around $350-$400 million per day. The “exchange inflow” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently being deposited to centralized exchanges by holders. Its counterpart metric is the “exchange outflow,” and it naturally tracks the volume leaving exchange wallets. Generally, during periods of high activity in the market, both these indicators rise to high values as a large number of investors make their respective moves. However, the price may react in particular directions depending on which of these metrics is higher at the moment. Since one of the main reasons why investors use exchanges is for selling purposes, inflows outweighing outflows could be bearish for Bitcoin. On the other hand, outflows being more dominant can suggest there may instead be buying pressure in the market as investors are withdrawing their coins for accumulation. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflows and outflows over the last few years: looks like both these metrics have declined in recent weeks | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 2, 2023 As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange inflows and outflows were both at high levels during the past couple of years, with their volumes remaining in the range of multi-billion dollars throughout. At the peak of inflows back in May 2021, between $2.8 billion to $3.5 billion per day was entering exchange wallets. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In Yet? Here’s What aSOPR Metric Suggests Recently, however, both the inflows and the outflows have significantly declined. Currently, the inflow volumes are between $350 million to $400 million per day, which are lows not seen since 2020. The outflows haven’t quite shrunk to these levels yet, possibly because of the fact that the collapse of FTX lead to renewed interest in self-custody among investors, which made them withdraw large amounts from centralized platforms. In the chart, data for the Ethereum exchange flows are also displayed. It seems like before May 2021, the Bitcoin exchange flow dominance was about 70%, which means the combined volumes of Ethereum inflows and outflows made up for 30% of the total between ETH and BTC during the period. But since May 2021, the share of the Ethereum flows has significantly increased as ETH inflows and outflows dominance is now 42%. This trend suggests that the relative trading interest in ETH has gone up in the last one and a half years, while BTC has lost some mindshare.

Winklevoss asked the DCG board to remove Silbert, citing DCG's inability to find a fair resolution with creditors of DCG's Genesis unit.  DCG, which is also the parent company of CoinDesk, didn't immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment, but the company tweeted on Tuesday that ""this is another desperate and unconstructive publicity stunt from @cameron to deflect blame from himself and Gemini, who are solely responsible for operating Gemini Earn and marketing the program to its customers.""  DCG further noted that ""we are preserving all legal remedies in response to these malicious, fake, and defamatory attacks.""  Gemini, which was founded by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, partnered with crypto trading firm Genesis to offer the yield product Gemini Earn. On Nov. 16, Genesis announced its lending business would be halting withdrawals, which then affected Gemini Earn customers' ability to access their funds.  Cameron Winklevoss and Silbert had traded verbal blows last week over the ongoing dispute over crypto lender Genesis, which is facing a crisis due to the industry turmoil caused by the FTX exchange's implosion and the blowup earlier in 2022 of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).  Read more: Gemini Co-Founder Accuses DCG’s Silbert of 'Bad Faith' Stalling in $900M Locked Funds Dispute  In the letter, Winklevoss alleged that DCG and Genesis ""pretended to"" plug the $1.2 billion hole left in Genesis' lending business by 3AC's collapse in July.  Winklevoss went on to allege that the companies committed ""accounting fraud"" by misrepresenting the bailout on Genesis' balance sheet under ""current assets"" (which commonly refers to cash and cash equivalents). Instead, DCG's payment to Genesis was in the form of a 10-year promissory note at 1% interest, which was worth only $300 million at face value, according to Winklevoss.  ""These misrepresentations were a sleight of hand designed to make it appear as if Genesis was solvent and able to meet its obligations to its lenders, without DCG actually committing to the financial support necessary to make it true,"" wrote Winklevoss.

The stablecoin – a digital asset backed by fiat currency – wouldn't be issued by the government, but instead by a third-party provider, Griffith told the Treasury Committee.  ""I want to see us establish a regime, and this is within the FSMB (Financial Services and Markets Bill) for the wholesale use for payment purposes of stablecoins,"" Griffith said, adding that the government is ""a long way down the road with"" the plan.  The wide-ranging FSMB, which is being debated in Parliament, would give regulators more power over crypto, including stablecoins. The bill should be ready for passage by Easter, Griffith said previously.  Lenders around the world have been moving forward with issuing stablecoins for settlements. Japan’s largest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust, for one, looks set to issue a stablecoin for settlements in February. In the U.S., a group of larger banks in November began working with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to test using digital tokens that represent the dollar for settlements.  The U.K. Treasury is launching a consultation on what issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for wholesale and retail payments will look like, but Griffith said he believes that the stablecoin will “get there first.” Treasury will also issue a consultation on further regulating the crypto industry in the coming weeks, something that lawmakers have been calling for following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  Despite the FTX debacle, the U.K. government still wants to establish the country as a crypto hub, said Griffith, and wants to allow space for this “potentially disruptive game-changing technology that can challenge but also turbocharge all of those (financial) industries.""

7352500,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515550,1673357412,Cardano Up 30% Since December As 28 New Whales Hold At least 1 Million ADA,"Though Cardano (ADA) has been gaining traction for a while, the recent accumulated momentum has garnered active buys as data shows the rising accumulation of ADA. ADA’s movement to the upside since last December totaled 30%, as new whales have been reported to be holding at least 1 million ADA tokens in these past few weeks amid the mini bull run. Regardless of the bear market, Cardano has proved to be a token worth holding both with its utilities and the recent positive news that includes the rapidly growing DeFi and NFT ecosystem of the Cardano Blockchain. Cardano Rally Since December Late last year, ADA gained traction and purchases from whales. According to crypto analytics platform Santiment, ADA has jumped an impressive 30% in its value since December 30th. Twenty-eight new whale addresses holding at least 1 million ADA have appeared on the Cardano blockchain since the price surge began, indicating an aggressive asset accumulation from large investors. In addition, Santiment mentioned that alongside the token’s upward rally, ADA trading volume and amount of large whale transactions hit 2-month high crushing levels last seen in November. Notably, ADA has been down by nearly 90% from its all-time high of $3.09. This recent accumulation resulting in a rally in its price could be what the token needs to recover. In the last 7 days alone, ADA has been up by 25%. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Up Nearly 20%, Aiming For A Higher High? Alongside the whole crypto market, ADA has taken advantage of the mini bull run and followed suit in the right direction. Among the largest crypto by market cap, ADA is still the only one making significantly higher highs, following Solana (SOL), which had already gained 43% in the past 7 days. Cardano’s Anticipated Catalyst While there is still no apparent reason behind the recent active accumulation of ADA, it’s worth noting that the blockchain itself has got big announcements it’s working on, which could be an enticing catalyst enough to attract large investors to buy up the digital asset. On the main stage at the CardanoSummit2022, the CEO of COTI, Shahaf Bar-Geffen, announced that Cardano is set to Launch an over-collateralized stablecoin which will go live on Mainnet later this month. Historically, the launch of stablecoins always ends up being a good enough catalyst or an appealing use case that often results in a significant surge in inflows as it causes on-ramps and off-ramps of funds that keep users within the ecosystem. Related Reading: Cardano Follows Bullish Sentiment, Why ADA Could Become Top 3 Coin Following its spike in accumulation, Cardano decentralized applications have also been seeing a spike in the number of unique accounts. DApps like Genius Yield have so far gained 2,810% growth in unique accounts in the last 5 days. All of these indicate a steady increase in Cardano adoption and decentralized finance activity. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, ADA is continuing in an uptrend, up by almost 1% in the past 24 hours with a trading price of 0.3180 and a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $500 million.

Nishad Singh, FTX’s former director of engineering, is said to have met with prosecutors in a ""proffer session."" Such meetings often include an offer of ""limited immunity"" to encourage the interviewee to speak freely. Singh hasn't been accused of wrongdoing. Central to Singh’s deal is information on FTX’s and Bankman-Fried’s large donations to political campaigns, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter. Singh personally has donated more than $9.3 million to Democratic Party-aligned initiatives since 2020.  After days of muted trading and crushed volatility, the crypto market came back swinging this week, as cryptocurrencies with smaller market capitalizations rallied, outperforming bitcoin and ether. Among the biggest gainers was FTT, the token of the FTX crypto exchange that failed spectacularly in November, jumping 55% on Monday, although it's still down 96% over the past year. Serum (SRM), the native token of the Solana-based decentralized exchange, surged 28%. ZIL, the Zilliqa blockchain project’s native token, increased 37%, while the native token of the Aptos blockchain, APT, known for its rocky launch and venture-capital backing, gained 40% on Tuesday.  Coinbase’s (COIN) premium brand as an onshore and regulated entitywith a healthy balance sheet should enable the crypto exchange to weather the fallout from the collapse of rival FTX, JefferiesGroup said in a research report Monday. Still, the broker initiated coverage of the stock with a hold rating and $35 price target, citing concerns about the broader crypto market. “The fallout from FTX has called into question the safety, security and legitimacy of the broader crypto ecosystem,” Jefferies said. Traders appear to be focused on Jefferies' positive comments as Coinbase's shares rose 14% in early trading Tuesday to $37.94.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows a three-axis framework, calling for crypto projects to deliver use cases beyond pure finance as the industry tries to rebalance.  ""DeFi (decentralized finance) should be relegated to an infrastructure layer that supports and enhances the value created on blockchains.

With the cryptocurrency market downturn, that started over a year ago, and extended with the failure of several firms, including crypto exchange FTX, Coinbase's ( COIN ) results have been dented. Coinbase stock has dropped 1.5% in premarket trading. The company still expects 2022 adjusted EBITDA within the -$500M range that it provided on Nov. 3 . It also expects to report 2022 average annual monthly transacting users, average transaction revenue per user, and subscription and services revenue to be consistent with its full-year 2022 outlook. Ultimately, CEO Brian Armstrong expects Coinbase ( COIN ) will emerge from the cryptocurrency turmoil stronger as FTX, a major competitor, failed, and regulations become clearer. ""But it will take time for these changes to come to fruition and we need to make sure we have the appropriate operational efficiency to weather downturns in the crypto market, and capture opportunities that may emerge,"" he said in a blog post . As part of its headcount reduction, Coinbase ( COIN ) will be shutting several projects where it has ""a lower probability of success,"" he said. In connection with the actions, the company expects to incur ~$149M-$163M in restructuring expenses, consisting of ~$58M-$68M in cash charges related to employee severance and termination benefits. Some $91M-$95M of the total charges will be in stock-based compensation expenditures for the accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards. Substantially all of the charges are expected to be recognized in Q1 2023. The restructuring plan will reduce some Q1 operating expenses — including sales and marketing, technology, and development, and general and administrative — by about 25%, it said.

Yearn will charge 10% as performance fees for providing such a facility. DeFi is a term used to describe financial activities carried out on a blockchain without traditional middlemen.  So far, users have been limited to vaults created by Yearn’s contributors and developers. With the introduction of the “permissionless vault factory,” anyone can create their own strategies and offer them on Yearn, where other interested users can deposit their own tokens and earn yields.  This may, in time, increase Yearn’s user base and attract more liquidity to the popular DeFi tool. Yearn produces revenue based on user liquidity, when it charges a portion of the rewards as fees for its yield-aggregation service.  Vaults refer to an on-chain product that uses crypto deposits to earn yield through various investment strategies. These yields are generated as a “reward” for participation in DeFi applications, such as lending, borrowing, or trading.  Yearn had over $360 million in total value locked as of Tuesday, DefiLlama data shows. More than 24 vaults are already active on the Yearn platform, offering yields ranging from 1.3% to as much as 17% annualized.  As of Tuesday, users can initially make vaults only for the liquidity tokens of Curve Finance, a stablecoin-swapping application. Those vaults will use veCRV, a time-locked token issued by Curve that allows users to effectively boost their yield rewards.  Some $100,000 in fees was generated on Curve in the past 24 hours, data shows, with these fees distributed to Curve users and liquidity providers.  The permissionless vaults are part of a broader V3 plan, which aims to make Yearn wholly decentralized in the future in terms of products and services offered to users.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | YFI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/10/defi-protocol-yearn-finance-will-now-let-users-farm-curve-rewards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d340ee01d408100797ad39aba3e8e2e082a95f9a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At press time, the largest cryptocurrency by market value traded 0.5% higher on the day at $17,260, having touched a three-week high of $17,391 on Monday, according to CoinDesk data. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, rose nearly 1% to $1,330.  The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, was little changed at 103.15. The global reserve currency fell to a seven-month low of 102.91 on Monday, extending a pullback from last week's 105.63 high on expectations the recent moderation in the U.S. wage growth will prompt the Fed to abandon liquidity tightening.  Powell is scheduled to speak at a Swedish central bank conference at 14:00 UTC. Traders will follow the speech closely for clarity about the Fed's tightening plans.  ""There is much interest in whether Chair Powell, who speaks at a Riksbank event, uses the opportunity to underscore the December minutes, which pushed back against the easing of financial conditions,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, wrote in a blog post published Monday.  In recent weeks, risky assets have reflected increasing confidence that the Fed will end its rate-hike cycle this quarter and switch to rate cuts in the third quarter. That's evident from the dollar index's slide in the wake of the recently released minutes of the Fed's December meeting and some Fed officials reiterating a higher-for-longer path of interest rates.  ""Certainly, the market does not buy into the Fed's narrative of the funds rate being taken to 5.00% and being kept there for a long time. Markets seem to price a 50bp easing cycle in 2H23,"" Frantisek Taborsky, a foreign-exchange strategist at ING, noted.  Therefore, a hawkish tone from Powell might have a minimal negative impact on the market.  ""Assuming that neither Powell's comments nor the NFIB breaks the building narrative of a more relaxed Fed (and Thursday's US CPI (Consumer Price Index) will also be key for this story), we would expect momentum to remain against the dollar,"" Taborsky added. The National Federation of Independent Business is due to release business optimism data later Tuesday.  Continued dollar weakness will likely bode well for bitcoin, helping the cryptocurrency build on its recent bullish breakout above its 50-day simple moving average (MA).  ""Bitcoin has seen upside follow-through since breaking out above its 50-day MA late last week on improved short-term momentum. The short-term breakout put the next resistance near $18,400,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, wrote in a note that was sent to clients on Monday.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/10/bitcoin-steady-above-17k-us-dollar-tepid-ahead-of-powell-speech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b66a158f15e5d0d6651e8206ca3495ea358f79bd-5579x3720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7350567,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515530,1673353804,Bitcoin On-Chain Data Shows Weak Baseline For 2023: Report,"Even though Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market are experiencing an upswing in the first days of the new year, on-chain data shows that the market remains in a deep slumber. As Glassnode explains in its latest report, the BTC price has shown historically low volatility over the past weeks. And according to the on-chain data for Bitcoin, there is currently little reason to believe that the boredom in the market will change quickly. However, if a move does occur, it will likely be an explosive market move, as in previous cycles when volatility was extremely low. To support this thesis, Glassnode cites Bitcoin’s realized volatility over the last month, which is at a multi-year low of 24.6%. As the chart below shows, there have been a few times in Bitcoin’s history when it has been this low. In most cases, BTC saw a rally after the market awakened; only in one case, in November 2018, did the price fall dramatically (-50%) lower. Bitcoin Network Usage Is Low Also, the weak baseline for Bitcoin is identified by Glassnode in continued restrained network usage. While on-chain activity increased after the FTX collapse, the uptick briefly leveled off later. The monthly average of new Bitcoin addresses is approaching the annual average again. Related Reading: Why Justin Sun’s Stablecoin USDD Is Struggling To Maintain Its Dollar Peg The overall transaction value of the network is in free fall. While the daily transfer volume was still around $40 billion in the third quarter of 2022, it is currently only $5.8 billion/day. The value is thus back at the level before the bull year 2020. According to Glassnode, this indicates a displacement of institutional capital. This is reflected in the fact that the share of transfers of more than $10 million has fallen from 42.8% before the collapse of FTX to only 19.0%. Glassnode states: This suggests a significant lull in institutional sized capital flows, and perhaps a serious shaking of confidence occurring among this cohort. It may also reflect, in part, and sadly, an expulsion of the questionable capital flows associated with the FTX/Alameda entities. One indicator of a breakout from boredom could be the inflows and outflows on exchanges. But again, Glassnode notes that the on-chain data does not yet signal any momentum for an explosive move. Bitcoin inflows are currently between $350 million and $400 million per day, a far cry from the billions seen in 2021-22, according to Glassnode. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Struggles Above $17K, Why BTC Is Still In Bullish Zone Major Indicator Remains Bearish According to the research firm, the Realized Cap is one of the most important metrics in on-chain analysis. Unfortunately, the metric currently gives BTC investors just as little hope for a change anytime soon. The Bitcoin Realized Cap has declined 18.8% since the all-time high, representing a net capital outflow of -$88.4 billion from the network. “This makes for the second largest relative decline in history, and the largest in terms of USD realized losses,” Glassnode notes, pointing at the following chart. Only in 2011/2012, the bear market drawdown was worse by 24%. Concluding the report, Glassnode says: [I]t is rare for such conditions to stick around for long. Past occasions where BTC and ETH volatility was this low have preceded extremely volatile market environments, with past examples trading both higher and lower. At press time, the BTC was slowly grinding higher in the 1-day chart. The price stood at $17,268.

42414701,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBEHwK,1673351915,Coinbase Cuts Around 20% of Workforce as Crypto Winter Rages,"Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) said it is planning to reduce its headcount by around 950 employees as part of a restructuring that it expects to be complete by the end of the second quarter.  This figure would amount to around 20% of Coinbase's workforce, which sits at about 4,700 according to the company's website.  In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday, Coinbase said it is responding to ""ongoing market conditions impacting the crypto economy.""  The company expects the restructuring to cost $149 million to $163 million, including $58 million to $68 million in cash charges related to employee severance.  Coinbase began shedding jobs last June when crypto's bear market started to take hold. CEO Brian Armstrong said at the time that the company had ""grown too quickly"" during the crypto bull market, expanding to more than 5,000 employees from 1,250 at the start of 2021.  The firm began by cutting 1,100 jobs, equivalent to 18% of its workforce at the time, followed by another 60 in November, as the crypto winter grew even colder with the collapse of rival exchange FTX.  Armstrong told CNBC on Tuesday that the company came to the decision after looking at various stress tests for Coinbase’s annual revenue. He added that “it became clear that we would need to reduce expenses to increase our chances of doing well in every scenario” and that there was “no way” to do so without reducing headcount.  Coinbase will also be shutting down several projects with a “lower probability of success.""  CoinDesk estimates that since last April, nearly 27,000 jobs have been lost across the crypto industry, based on media reports and press releases.  Shares of Coinbase were recently down 1% at $38.

42414706,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBEICF,1673351605,Bernstein: Recent Gains in Some Cryptocurrencies Caused by Short Covering,"This year began at a time of peak bearish sentiment in crypto markets, but in the past 24 hours, cryptocurrencies have gained, with some out-of-favor coins climbing more than 20%, Bernstein said in a research report Monday.  Many of the tokens that have rallied in the last couple of days are the ones that were most shorted, including solana (SOL) and lido (LDO), the report said.  Shorting is a way of betting that a price will decline. An investor borrows a security and sells it in the hope that the price will drop. They then repurchase the security and return it to the lender. The borrower can then pocket the difference if they are right or fork out the difference if wrong.  Investors had bet against liquid staking platform Lido on concerns that the next Ethereum upgrade will fail to introduce the scheduled ability to withdraw staked ether (ETH). Solana had declined on the fallout from crypto exchange FTX’s collapse, the report added. FTX and sister company Alameda Research held large amounts of solana on their balance sheets.  In the last 24 hours, forced buying by investors who had shorted the tokens – a so-called short squeeze – saw lido gain 21% and solana 24%, the note said. LDO is up 81% this year and SOL 67%, while ether has gained 11% and bitcoin (BTC) 5%, Bernstein said.  “Ether strength is all fundamentals,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote. “ETH is the apex asset for the new cycle (whenever it commences).”  With the optimism around China reopening, Bernstein notes that bullish investors have been making the case that buying has been led by Asia, rather than the U.S., where sentiment is still muted in the aftermath of FTX.  The broker says this is potentially a “transitory narrative” given that crypto markets are generally more upbeat before the Chinese New Year, which starts Jan. 22.

But There's a Catch,"Solana blockchain-based token Bonk Inu (BONK) will offer more than 15,000 non-fungible token (NFT) collectibles on Solana marketplace Magic Eden on Tuesday, a representative told CoinDesk.  The NFTs, which are digital tokens that represent ownership of a physical or virtual asset, may help further BONK’s usage on Solana's network. BONK has attracted massive transaction volume and hype in the past week.  The NFT collection was made in collaboration with prominent Solana-based NFT projects and is fashioned as “profile pictures” for holders to use on social-media networks such as Twitter. The collection brings artists from the Solana community, including John Le and the Omni creative studio – the team behind the popular Fracture and Gods Solana NFT projects.  A portion of the collection will be given to Gods holders for supporting the project and studio. More than 8,000 of the supply will be left to be minted for only wallets that hold BONK.  The BONK profile pictures will be purely art-based with no imminent plans for utility, representatives said. Pricing for the mint – a term that refers to the initial issuance of any NFT – will be set at $25 worth of BONK, and secondary trading will be transacted with solana (SOL) tokens.  Holders of the “Gods” NFT collection on Solana will be the first to be able to mint the Bonk collectibles. As such, all BONK raised will be burned and deleted from existence. Half of the royalties generated from sales following the launch will also be used to buy and burn BONK forever.  Future governance for the Bonk Inu project will remain with the Solana-based BONK token, not the NFT, meaning NFT holders don't get voting rights for the future of the Bonk Inu as of Tuesday.  ""The governance of the bonk inu token remains SOLELY with the SPL token, and the BONKz collection has no impact or association with the token,"" Omni told CoinDesk in a tweet.  Bonk, a Shiba Inu-themed token that was issued on Dec. 25, returned as much as 3,220% to traders in the past week before profit-taking saw the price fall nearly 70% from its lifetime peak. The token was airdropped to Solana NFT communities and creators, which led to quick hype and high trading volumes for the Bonk project.  Bonk tokens saw steady adoption in the Solana ecosystem with several Solana projects having already integrated Bonk tokens for buying and selling listed NFTs, and some introduced “burn” mechanisms for NFT-based events.

This strengthened the hopes of the holders of the crypto that it might have a strong bullish rally this year as opposed to the consistent downtrend it had experienced over the last two months. At the moment, this could prove true as data from Coingecko indicates that the asset rose by 16% during the past seven days. At the time of writing, CHZ was trading at $0.1181. Analysts, however, are giving words of caution that this rally might be short-lived as some developments that involve the altcoin are not necessarily indications of a major surge that would provide an opportunity for profit taking among holders. Image: Watcher Guru Chiliz Whets Appetite Of ETH Whales According to the information shared by crypto whales tracker WhaleStats via Twitter, Chiliz was able to surpass Numeraire (NMR) as it became the most traded digital token among the top 500 ETH whales.

If this action is not averted, the altcoin might be subjected to tremendous selling pressure and this could be disastrous as it often leads to price crash. Related Reading: Why Justin Sun’s Stablecoin USDD Is Struggling To Maintain Its Dollar Peg Moreover, it is important to note that during the time when Chiliz was making its mini rally to recoup its losses over the last few months, the number of tokens held by its top addresses significantly declined – a potential indicator that large investors are now cashing out. This trend continued even when the number of active addresses for CHZ increased this January – a development that might have been caused by the anticipated rally that the crypto asset is supposed to make this month. CHZ total market cap at $815 million on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com What Awaits Chiliz (CHZ) Meanwhile, forecasts from online cryptocurrency information provider Coincodex do not contain any exciting news for holders of CHZ.

42414713,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBEIsh,1673344898,Poor Bitcoin Market Liquidity Keeps Crypto Whales at Bay,"Large traders, often called ""whales,"" are staying on the sidelines of the bitcoin (BTC) market despite a risk reset in traditional markets because thin liquidity is making it difficult to buy or sell the coin without affecting its price.  In signs of the increasing appetite for risk, stocks have gathered upside traction while the U.S. dollar has taken a beating on optimism that China’s reopening is gaining steam and the Federal Reserve may be close to winding up its liquidity-tightening cycle. In crypto, however, market depth – a measure of an asset's price resilience to large orders – is relatively low and discouraging activity.  ""Aggregated 2% BTC market depth has dropped by almost half to around 8,000 BTC from 14,000 BTC at the end of October,"" analysts at Bitfinex, one of the top 10 centralized cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, wrote in a market report on Monday. ""In other words, a large order of the same USD value or size placed today will have more than twice the impact on price in contrast to two months ago.""  Crypto pundits typically keep track of the 2% market depth to assess liquidity conditions. The gauge represents a collection of the buy and sell orders within 2% of the mid-price – the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices being quoted at a given time.  ""This is very discouraging for whales and larger trading firms actively trading crypto purely as an alternative publicly traded market,"" the analysts said.  The chart, sourced from Paris-based Kaiko Research, shows bitcoin's 2% market depth across major exchanges, including Bitfinex, crashed from around 11,000 BTC to about 6,000 BTC after Sam Bankman Fried's FTX exchange, formerly the world's third-largest, and its sister concern Alameda Research went bust in early November.  The depth has since remained below 10,000 BTC.  ""Alameda Research was one of the largest market makers in crypto, providing billions of dollars' worth of liquidity for high-cap and low-cap tokens alike. We now know that the entire trading operation was funded by funds siphoned directly from FTX's clients,"" Kaiko's analysts said in their latest quarterly review, referring to the shallow market depth as the ""Alameda gap in liquidity.""  Other prominent market makers like Wintermute, Genesis Global Trading and Amber Group also had exposure to FTX and have been hurt by the exchange's bankruptcy.  The unwillingness of large investors to participate in the market due to poor liquidity is evident from dwindling daily trading volumes on centralized exchanges (CEX).  ""While daily CEX volume has always fluctuated, the period between Nov. 25 to Dec. 25 had the lowest aggregated daily trading volume for a 30-day period (discounting the holiday period to avoid skewing the data),"" analysts at Bitfinex said, citing data sourced from Kaiko.  BTC, the most liquid cryptocurrency  Bitcoin, the world's largest digital asset by market capitalization, remains the most liquid cryptocurrency. Whales, therefore, are likely to prefer it over other coins when they return to the crypto market.  The chart above from Kaiko Research compares the top 28 tokens by market value with their respective liquidity ranks, calculated using market depths, bid-ask spreads and trading volumes.

This no longer comes as a surprise considering that at one point during the last seven days, the digital asset, which was pulled all the way down to $9 towards the end of December, managed to increase its value by 46%. SOL outperformed industry frontrunners Bitcoin and Ethereum and all other top crypto assets occupying the top 10 spot in terms of market capitalization. Related Reading: Why Justin Sun’s Stablecoin USDD Is Struggling To Maintain Its Dollar Peg It would appear that the Solana Network is now ready to move on and rebuild after the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange platform where it had significant exposure courtesy of the 3.24 million shares of common stocks and 134.54 million FTT tokens it held. SOL seems to be on the right track at the early days of 2023 as a quick look at its intraday performance reveals its current surge is not yet done. Image: Coinpedia Solana Up More Than 60% Before Minor Correction Phase According to tracking from Coingecko, at the time of writing, Solana was changing hands at $16.41 and has gone up by almost 12% during the last 24 hours. Within the previous seven days, SOL has posted an impressive 45.7% increase while on its month-to-date (MTD) performance, the crypto asset is up 21%. It is important to note, however, that this came after the altcoin entered a minor correction phase that made it fall below the $17 marker. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Is Now 4th Most Popular Cryptocurrency On BitPay Just a few hours before the closing of the January 9 trading sessions, Solana peaked at $17.37 but was unable to sustain its run in that particular territory. Meanwhile, price analysis points such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicate that SOL remains bullish and might soon test the price range of between $16.5 and $18.2. Analysts, however, are not convinced that the cryptocurrency’s gains are a representation of a long-term trend and could only be a “knee-jerk reaction” to months of bearish cycles. SOL total market cap at $5.9 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com Meme Coin BONK Helping Solana’s Rally Aside from the efforts being done by the Solana Foundation to move forward after being hammered by the events involving the Sam Bankman-Fried company FTX, SOL appears to have benefited from the rousing success of BONK. The Solana-based meme crypto has managed to increase its total market cap by more than 1,000% last week as it turned heads in the digital currency space. At press time, the digital asset is trading at $0.00000161 and is enjoying a 97.5% increase in value over the last seven days.

The tokens were dumped almost immediately by recipients.  More than 4.28 billion FLR tokens were shared and distributed to XRP holders who held at least one token during a snapshot in December 2020. The airdrop was conducted on a 1:1 basis, meaning one FLR for every XRP held.  The airdropped tokens now represent 15% of the project’s total supply, with the remaining scheduled to be distributed over the next three years.  FLR holders will be able to vote for the way the future airdrop is distributed on Flare’s governance forums, alongside proposing other changes to the project.  The tokens were priced initially at 5 cents amid low liquidity on the MEXC Global exchange, before tripling to 15 cents as exchanges such as OKX and Kraken joined in and liquidity increased, CoinGecko data shows. The price slumped to as low as 2 cents and was quoted recently at 4 cents on CoinGecko. The tokens amassed $34 million in trading volume as of 10:30 UTC on Tuesday.  Flare, which initially aimed to become a decentralized-finance (DeFi) application that used XRP tokens, has gradually made a transition to a layer 1 blockchain and oracle provider. Layer 1 refers to base blockchains, such as Ethereum or Solana, while oracles are third-party services that fetch data from outside a blockchain to within.

7339122,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515479,1673334037,Why Justin Sun’s Stablecoin USDD Is Struggling To Maintain Its Dollar Peg,"A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a certain fiat currency. It provides stability for investors of crypto, making transactions easier. USDD, a stablecoin created by the founder of the Tron Blockchain, Justin Sun, has been losing its peg to the U.S. dollar. According to Coingecko, USDD is currently trading at $0.9805. Although USDD was designed to be pegged to the dollar like other stablecoins, its value has fluctuated between $0.9806 and $0.9798 during the past week. As this developed, Sun’s crypto exchange, Huobi Global, joined the ranks of crypto companies that started this year with job cuts. Adding to the pressure is the fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding the Huobi exchange itself. Recent social media posts regarding the exchange shows that Huobi has higher withdrawals than deposits which strengthened fears of a possible halting of withdrawals. USDD creator, Justin Sun. Image: Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate How Does USDD Stablecoin Work? USDD is an algorithmic stablecoin which uses complex arithmetic to keep the price pegged to a dollar. According to Tron DAO’s blog post about the inner workings of USDD, the stablecoin is not considered de-pegged by the system when it drops lower or goes higher than $1. Looking at the charts, the stablecoin is consistently testing its 3% leeway set by the system. Although the system itself does not consider USDD depegged, this consistency is worrying as any further drop might cause more troubles – or eventually led to the fate that befell UST when it crashed. With investors skeptical of USDD since its inception, Sun has not done anything as of now. This is clearly because of the current situation at Huobi, leaving the reins to the system that govern USDD. 🟡 Justin’s $1.1B withdrawal: – It was speculated that this was used to fund Huobi’s operations – Likely untrue, the amount is way too large to cover burn rate – Even Twitter running at its most wasteful state only burns at $4mil/month – Whispers of him cashing out 4/ https://t.co/DXwtdjRtFP — Rock 🪨 (@DataaRocks) January 6, 2023 Huobi’s Situation And What It Means For USDD Sun, who is advisor to Huobi, has been said to be withdrawing more than a billion dollars which further strengthened the FUD surrounding the exchange. Speculators, however, believe that the withdrawn funds would be used for the operations of Huobi. This might be true, as the exchange might be burning through its liquidity as withdrawals continue to mount up due to recent negative developments. Any negative news on Huobi might have an effect on the peg of USDD and USDJ.

Not to mention that both stablecoins are limited in where they can be bought and sold. According to CoinCodex, USDD is tradable on 11 exchanges while USDJ is tradable on three. Both can be traded on Huobi and Poloniex. At @HuobiGlobal, we believe that the key to success in the world of cryptocurrency is to “Ignore FUD and Keep Building.” — H.E. Justin Sun🌞🇬🇩🇩🇲🔥 (@justinsuntron) January 6, 2023 With Sun being one of the shady characters in the crypto, it remains to be seen whether his “ignore the FUD” strategy will work.

42421089,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRsD,1673326800,Hong Kong’s Finance Regulator Calls for 'a More Solid Footing' for Crypto,"HONG KONG – Christopher Hui first heard of crypto from some friends who were running investment funds and investing in virtual assets. Now, as secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of Hong Kong (FSTB), he’s developing policy direction for the sector.  During Hong Kong FinTech Week, held in early November, he asked one of his staff whether he should get his first virtual asset. The bureau is piloting a non-fungible token (NFT) offering – one of a few pilots the regulator is rolling out, along with tokenizing green bonds and a central bank digital currency (CDBC), the e-HKD.  While the industry has known for a while that a regulatory framework was incoming, it did not expect the shift in stance. Many of the stalls and panels at FinTech Week were related to the metaverse, and top regulators came out in force to advocate for the city’s comeback as a crypto hub, among which Hui was the most prominent.  Crypto currently falls under several regulators in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is looking into stablecoins, the Securities and Futures Commission takes on enforcement responsibilities.  The department Hui heads, FSTB, lays down the more macro approach to regulation. The approach it seems to be taking is to place crypto within financial regulation, and signal an opening of areas up for discussion such as allowing retail investors under the incoming regulatory framework, which was previously a no.  Hui’s stature and his appearance at Hong Kong FinTech Week panels speaking on crypto give clear signals that Hong Kong’s regulators view it as part of the city’s economic future.  Hui reiterated views voiced by other high profile figures in Hong Kong’s regulatory bodies, who see crypto as fitting into mainstream finance. When asked what he thinks about crypto’s founding ideals, Hui said he considers crypto to be more an investment instrument than a bid for freedom from fiat currency.  He seemed tentatively optimistic about its applications. “Potentially, it is a transformation to how society and economy work,” he said of the underlying technology in an interview with CoinDesk, adding that “it’s not built overnight.”  Most important to him are the use cases: “My inclination is to see through these investments and look at what’s behind them, what’s underlying them,” he said.  He said that he’s most excited about the tokenization of green bonds, which makes what can be a cumbersome process of issuance and investment far more streamlined.  Hong Kong has already issued $10 billion in green bonds in multiple currencies, including the U.S. dollar, euro and renminbi. The pilot will focus on institutions and the whole value chain from issuance to settlement, asset servicing, secondary trading and retention.  Hui also said there are many areas in which technology can really address bottlenecks, shortening the subscription for initial public offerings as an example.  Comparisons are often made between Hong Kong and Singapore and the competition between the two to capture businesses. For Hui, Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” is its key differentiating feature, referring to how the city is part of China but can organize its own affairs. He pointed to an acceleration programme that allows Hong Kong companies to access industries in China.  The blocks are ready  Officials often play up the intermediary role that Hong Kong plays between China and the rest of the world. When it comes to virtual assets however, given the ban in China, Hong Kong isn’t playing this role – so what role is it playing?  “We’re able to bring together investments globally,” Hui said. “We can manage and also channel these investments in a well-regulated and also sustainable manner.”  He underscored the credibility that he said Hong Kong has as a gateway to China and its linkage to the international community.  Hui puts this down to a mix of factors citing Hong Kong’s “rule of law, regulation, commercial modus operandi.”  Hui refused to give further details on whether the newly launched Hong Kong Monetary Fund would consider investing into crypto companies. “They are bound by their own mandates and policies,” he said.  CoinDesk has written about companies being unsure about whether Hong Kong can set its own policy when it comes to crypto. Hui is adamant that it can.  Asked whether Beijing had given any reassurances to the regulator on cryptocurrencies specifically, Hui said, “it is more business as usual because after all we are operating one country, two systems. We have our own regulatory systems, we have our own legal systems.”  Over the last month, eyes were on the Party Congress happening across the border, where China President Xi Jinping’s third term was confirmed. China stocks dipped right after. Political developments have affected investor confidence in Hong Kong.  But Hui didn’t appear to be worried. “Hong Kong is an international financial center, so basically our stock performance reflects overall sentiment,” Hui said. He said that there have been smooth operations in markets. “There's no systemic risk presented,” he said.  He would even welcome crypto companies leaving China. “Hong Kong is a very open place,” Hui said. “Whoever meets our law and requirements, they’re welcome.”  With the incoming VASP regime and consultations, Hui said that the “blocks are ready” to build the ecosystem. “We are more definitely clear in terms of where we stand,” he said, calling it a “more solid footing.”  Moving with the market  At the opening of Fintech Week, Hong Kong announced that it was attempting to come back again as a crypto hub. The regulator said that it was open to discussing a crypto futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), and allowing licensed exchanges to serve retail users.  Until a few months ago, there was little indication Hong Kong was considering anything other than a professional investor-only environment. “It’s progressive,” Hui said. “We move with the market, we move with the industry, we are with them in the journey to mitigate risk, manage them and also grow this ecosystem.”  Previous policy direction prevented licensed platforms from offering services to retail traders, but also required all exchanges to secure licenses. Currently, retail traders mostly use unlicensed platforms.  Hong Kong investors are able to invest in U.S. crypto ETFs which likely offer more liquidity than Hong Kong ones would. Still, the announcements show that more options are on the table.  That regulators are more open to discussion is a running theme of Hui’s answers. He refrained from giving more specifics on rules, standards, and requirements that regulators might have for retail investors. “We need to consult the market,” he said.  Though there have already been reports that Hong Kong will open to retail, the rules, standards and timeline are still undecided. He underlined the importance of investor education.  Hong Kong’s attempt to come back as a crypto hub comes in a year of market turmoil, which saw Terra’s crash, VC funds’ liquidation and jurisdictions like Singapore tightening regulation over crypto.  “It doesn’t come out of nowhere,” Hui said, about the timing. He pointed to the experience Hong Kong accumulated through introducing an opt-in system for virtual asset exchanges to get certain licenses which allow them to deal in securities and provide automated trading services, and also to fund managers who are dealing with virtual assets.  This crypto winter may have made people more discerning about what works and what doesn’t, he said. “It’s the right time to take stock.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/10/hong-kongs-finance-regulator-calls-for-a-more-solid-footing-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec821dde6fe8352c4e2a516172c3af9685f2282d-6192x4128.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411058,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBEd5,1673320939,"Virtual Worlds, Real-Life Use Cases: How Web2 and Web3 Tackled the Metaverse at CES 2023","What is the metaverse? Well, it depends on whom you ask, as the loose term referring to a future immersive virtual world continues to morph across industries. Will it be a social platform? Will virtual reality (VR) headsets be the gateway to entry? Will it blur the line between reality and technology?  At this year’s massive four-day Consumer Electronics Show (CES), it was clear that both Web2- and Web3-native companies have different views on the path forward.  The term “metaverse” was first coined in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 science fiction novel “Snow Crash,” though the development of technologies to enhance the metaverse experience has expanded rapidly in recent years. Mainstream companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) have shifted their focus to innovating in the sector and countries such as Japan have laid out plans to integrate metaverse technology at a national level. Platforms, like The Sandbox, Spatial and Decentraland have sprung up to offer virtual social experiences, though a fully immersive, interconnected metaverse does not yet exist.  Blockchain technology is being used as a tool to propel the metaverse forward, and the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center was filled with new technologies familiar to the Web3 world. From metaverse company Ixana’s haptic VR technology to Samsung and LG’s smart televisions with blockchain integrations such as non-fungible token (NFT) wallets and marketplaces, CES offered a glimpse into a fantastical decentralized future.  But some Web3 builders say that the metaverse isn’t going to arrive as the result of a major technological breakthrough – instead, it will find a way to seamlessly integrate into everyday life.  “Bridging the digital and physical in an unremarkable, everyday kind of way, with unremarkable everyday technology is actually the core [of the metaverse],” said Cathy Hackl, chief metaverse officer of Journey, a Web3 consultancy company, on a panel at CES.  Web2 brands create meaningful experiences  Whether it was the Metaverse Fashion Week in March, Snapple’s Metaverse Bodega in August or October’s Metaverse Music Festival, many mainstream brands took their first steps into Web3 this past year. However, some critics have been quick to label these activations as simply a “PR stunt.”  Justin Hochberg, CEO and founder of metaverse agency Virtual Brand Group, told CoinDesk that brands have reason to explore the metaverse beyond producing a one-time activation – they can deepen relationships with consumers, expand into new markets and avoid challenges associated with the physical world.  “The laws of gravity don't apply and there are no supply chain issues,” Hochberg said. “When we can create a race car as easily as a scarf, it opens up the creative floodgates to what you want your brand to be.”  He predicts that as more companies embrace Web3, they will move beyond simple activations and work to create seamless solutions for their consumers.  “I think you will start to see people creating real solutions to real problems, not just for the sake of technology,” said Hochberg. “Ultimately, the metaverse will be incorporated into people's daily lives much like the internet is or your iPhone is, so you won't even have to think about it.”  Large tech companies native to Web2 are also looking to integrate into Web3 and are creating the technologies to do so. From Microsoft's global chief strategy officer of mobility, automotive and transportation Henry Bzeih’s bullish take on the metaverse to LG’s “shoe-case” NFT product, household names are looking to build for the long term.  “When I see executives speak out about [the metaverse] and talk about their investment in it, it really gives me optimism and hope,” Shira Lazar, founder of independent publication What’s Trending and host of the podcast ""Inside Web3,"" told CoinDesk. “We start to see these real-life applications beyond the numbers we’ve seen on Decentraland and The Sandbox in 2022.”  Rahul Sabnis, executive vice president and chief creative officer at iHeartMedia, said on a panel that the digital media company chose to launch activations in Web2 metaverse spaces that were already popular but it was important to show up in ways that weren’t “one and done.” He believes that brands need to keep fans engaged and he touched on Web3 ways that could be done.  Sabnis imagined fans at “every concert, [they] scan the QR code, it acts as a wallet, NFT drops are there, there's a chance for seat upgrades.” These wallets could sync with where you are in a venue in real time and expand the experience with augmented reality, for example. In the end, whether it’s Web2 or Web3, Sabnis concluded that “entertaining things are the things that matter most in people’s lives.”  The future of work  Many metaverse activations thus far have been focused on entertainment and leisure, and nothing has gotten more attention than video games. While gamification facilitates a smoother adoption from Web2 to Web3, it hasn’t to date proved to be the key to reaching mass adoption.  A trend at CES was using metaverse technology to enhance productivity and usher in the future of work, paving the way for a new audience to experience Web3.  Dentsu NXT Space, a metaverse initiative in collaboration with Microsoft, LinkedIn and metaverse company HeadOffice.Space, is building a platform for working in the metaverse.  “People had a hard time imagining use cases that would match their businesses, but now they’ve matured and know how they want to use it,” Marco Carvahlo, CEO of HeadOffice.Space, told CoinDesk. “We see a lot of interest from HR departments all the way to e-commerce.”  With a showroom at CES, Dentsu NXT Space debuted some of its technologies to highlight how its platform can bring businesses into Web3.  “In the first metaverse iterations, you couldn’t do what we’re doing, which is building the metaverse for productivity, so you can take your customers, bring your meetings, your clients, and embed it in your website,” said Carvahlo. “It’s taking it one step further so we can have real productivity in the metaverse.”  Dentsu NXT Space isn’t alone in its efforts to bring work to the metaverse. Japanese company FORUM8 International is looking to build a productivity-oriented metaverse for companies to establish their offices in the metaverse. The company also displayed its tech on the floor, showcasing software that will allow companies to take work online.  “We’re trying to build something easy to use, integrating communication features – in the office you want to have face-to-face communication, you can enter meetings by entering meeting rooms, [or you] can start voice chat in VR and have a text chat in the office,” said Luc Kuenemann, software engineer at FORUM8 International.  While more brands are stepping into the metaverse, their approaches don’t all look the same. From clunky headsets to bodysuits to immersive computer experiences, much of the technology shaping the metaverse is taking different forms. Kuenemann told CoinDesk that considering these differences will be crucial in figuring out how to unify social experiences.  “How do you integrate mixed realities – people who want to work in VR, AR or simple 3D experiences?” asked Kuenemann. “How do you get all those people together to work the way they want to work? It’s a big challenge to tackle [in the metaverse].”  Crypto elements  While the various metaverse showcases at CES incorporated a range of Web2 technologies, the Web3-native brands that showed up to the event made the case for blockchain and cryptocurrency to be an integral part of some of these innovations.  Sandy Carter, senior vice president of Web3 company Unstoppable Domains, told CoinDesk that the company’s technology, such as crypto wallets and blockchain domains, is creating the on-ramps for mainstream metaverse experiences.  “We’re the gateway into Web3 … and that’s where a lot of people are today. That digital identity piece is one of the first building blocks of the metaverse and Web3,” said Carter.  Digital identity, in the form of a wallet ID or an Ethereum domain, is one way that Unstoppable is helping users take their identity across decentralized applications and other blockchain-based products. Carter told CoinDesk that “more integrations [of identity] with utility,” are coming up in 2023, and interoperability will be a key component in making the metaverse accessible.  Although the crypto space is largely still dealing with the widespread fallout of FTX’s unraveling, Web3 companies remain optimistic. The Blockchain Association’s inaugural presence at CES was aimed at highlighting how blockchain technology and cryptocurrency can underpin many of the technological trends forecasted for the year ahead.  Ron Hammond, director of government relations at the Washington, D.C.-based crypto advocacy group, told CoinDesk that the current state of the market isn’t stopping innovation in the space, as many companies are still exploring crypto payments, NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi).  “We’ve gone back to the basics of rebuilding, focusing on the tech and not talking about [crypto] prices as much,” said Hammond. “We desperately need that energy after the fall of FTX.”  He also noted that among cryptocurrency products, utility is on the rise, and it’s only going to grow as we enter the new year.  “Folks in D.C. are clamoring for real-world use cases and it’s all around [CES].”  The bet on branding  Web3, a buzzword itself, is an ecosystem of similar buzzwords that come with barriers to entry. So as terms like metaverse, blockchain and NFTs make their way into the conversation, some individuals and companies have been eager to distance themselves from the jargon.  Kirthiga Reddy, co-founder and CEO of Web3 marketing agency Virtualness, said on a panel that NFTs shouldn’t be the go-to term for the technology and that it’s actually a reference to metadata. Rather, descriptions that speak to its identity and interoperability offerings are what’s necessary to facilitate adoption.  As more brands enter Web3, they’ve attempted to demystify these technologies by calling NFTs “digital collectibles.” Starbucks’ Odyssey loyalty program, Meta’s minting and selling of digital art on the platform, and NFT collective Front of House’s preferential restaurant booking tokens are just a few examples of initiatives that are veering away from the use of “non-fungible token” in favor of language that eases the onboarding process.  “The terminology has replaced the reality of what’s going on,” said Ted Schilowitz, a futurist at Paramount Global. “For me, I sort of want to pull back on it. I want to talk about the way technology propels innovation forward.”  A common thread throughout CES was the creation of frictionless experiences that focus on what fans and communities really want. These experiences also need to be delightful – which will prove key to mainstream metaverse adoption.  “In the metaverse we are all world builders and we all have a chance to build,” Hackl concluded. “At the end of the day it’s about people.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MANA | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/10/virtual-worlds-real-life-use-cases-how-web2-and-web3-tackled-the-metaverse-at-ces-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6df34d5f5299f1d97c73d3d30083a897efce855b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414733,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBEISA,1673317775,First Mover Asia: Altcoin Short Squeeze Brings Green Shoots to Dormant Crypto,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Solana's SOL and alternative coins including Serum's SRM are benefiting from the year's first mini-rally in altcoins. A short squeeze added fuel.  Insights: Alex Thorn, head of research at crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital, tells CoinDesk that Web3 blockchain startups and trading-based services could continue to lead venture-capital deals and funding in 2023.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 841.62 +6.7 ▲ 0.8% Bitcoin (BTC) $17,186 −20.4 ▼ 0.1% Ethereum (ETH) $1,326 +26.0 ▲ 2.0% S&P 500 daily close  3,892.09 −3.0 ▼ 0.1% Gold  $1,879 +6.5 ▲ 0.3% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.52% ▼ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Mini altcoin rally generates enthusiasm for first time in months  By Sam Reynolds  Everyone gets a second chance in crypto.  Weeks ago, Solana was on its deathbed. As 2022 came to a close, the Ethereum competitor — which was at the center of the Sam Bankman-Fried universe of tokens — had lost more than 90% of its value. Its loudest cheerleaders, such as Sino Global Capital, may have gotten stuck as big holders.  But now Solana's native SOL tokens are getting a fast price pump as crypto markets attempt a recovery after months in the doldrums, according to CoinDesk data. The protocol’s token is up 11% in the last 24 hours and 46% in the last two weeks. As CoinDesk reported earlier, there’s strong transactional activity on the network, with daily active users increasing by 40% during the last two weeks. Silly meme coins like the Shiba inu-themed BONK token, which is paying out 2021 ""DeFi Summer""-like 1,000% yield for liquidity providers, has a lot to do with it.  Aside from Solana’s comeback story, the other crypto majors are also doing well. Bitcoin (BTC) is slowly creeping its way back to $20,000, having recently breached the $17,000 mark, and ether (ETH) is up 3% in the last 24 hours, coming in at $1,326. Altcoins got a boost from a short squeeze. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is up 1.2% over the past 24 hours.  All this is pushing up crypto-related mining stocks too. Granted, many are down 80% on-year for 2022, but recoveries begin with green shoots.  Insights  Galaxy Digital's Head of Research Sees More Venture Funding for Web3 Firms This Year  By Fran Velasquez  Web3 blockchain startups and trading-based services led venture-capital deals and funding in 2022, and the trend could continue this year, according to Alex Thorn, head of research at crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital.  Thorn told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Monday that the Web 3 sector, which is made up of non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized autonomous organizations, the metaverse and online gaming, were 31% of deals in 2022, while 13% were made up of trading platforms.  VCs invested more than $30 billion into crypto and blockchain startups in 2022, according to Galaxy's “Crypto VC Year End” report.  Thorn noted, however, that the number of deals and amount of money invested steadily declined every quarter during 2022, pointing out that macroeconomic factors coupled with the fall of significant crypto companies may have played a role in the decrease.

In the past year or so Hong Kong has lagged behind its peer cities, like Singapore and Dubai, due to concerns over its regulatory landscape and the influence of mainland China, which has banned crypto trading and mining.  Read more: China Casts Long Shadow Over Hong Kong's Once-Vibrant Crypto Industry  However, since November authorities in the city have made their desire clear to bring Hong Kong back on the crypto map.  Against this backdrop, Nasdaq-listed Dragon Victory International Limited (LYL) is rebranding to Metalpha Technology Holding Limited, the name of its asset management and hedging subsidiary, according to a statement sent to CoinDesk.  After the rebranding, the “brand name will be much easier to be to be viewed by the client,” Metalpha founder and CEO Adrian Wang told CoinDesk. Essentially, investors and clients will be able to easily recognize the Metalpha financial services on the Nasdaq ticker, as the company pushes more into the crypto space.  Dragon Victory was initially offering crowdfunding services out of Hangzhou, China, and later pivoted to supply chain management before finding its way to blockchain in 2021.  Metalpha, which offers asset management and hedging services, is a limited liability company, 49% of which was owned by Bitmain-tied financial services firm Antalpha, and 51% of which was owned by Meta Rich Limited, which in turn was 100% owned by Dragon Victory International.  Bitmain is the world’s largest manufacturer of bitcoin mining rigs.  Following the restructuring, Metalpha will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the listed company, which in turn will be renamed to Metalpha Technology Holding Limited (MATH). Antalpha is also an investor in the listed company, but it did not disclose the specific share it owns.  The two companies work closely together and that won’t change after the restructuring, Wang said.  Through its partnership with Antalpha, Bitmain has been expanding its reach into financial services, on top of its mining offerings like machines and cloud mining services. Its involvement in Metalpha not only enables it to be an investor in asset management and hedging space, but to use their products, too.  Customer base  Antalpha is also Metalpha’s largest customer, bringing in “over $100 million” in assets, Wang said.  Read more: Bitmain Partner Antalpha Unveils Lending Products for Miners  Antalpha did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on this report.  Metalpha offers hedging services to institutional clients, about 20%-30% of which are mining firms, and the rest are other institutional investors like family offices, Wang told CoinDesk. The firm doesn’t serve clients in mainland China.  “Because of the current market situation,” new entrants to the crypto market are “kind of hesitant,” Wang said; they either start with small trades as a test, or they open an account and wait for their preferred market conditions. So Metalpha is focusing on existing clients, mostly from the crypto space who are “very hungry for hedging solutions because they lost a lot of money [in this bear market]. Some of them are afraid that if the market continues to behave like this, they need to protect themselves,” he said.  However, even the cost of hedging can be prohibitive for some firms at the moment. “It's more like saving people that haven’t drowned yet,” said Wang.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/10/hong-kong-firm-with-ties-to-bitmain-reorganizes-to-focus-on-crypto-asset-management-and-hedging,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dad384f84b26b0451ad848e72b4c8caba9ab631d-1792x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
