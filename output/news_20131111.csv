42376676,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6beGt,1384203602,itBit raises $3.25 Million to build finance-grade bitcoin trading platform,"A new virtual currency exchange has raised $3.25m to fund the expansion of its operations.  Singapore-based itBit, which has raised $5.5m in funding to date, will use the money to bring institutional investment technology to bitcoin.  “itBit is the first bitcoin exchange built on global equities exchange standards, therefore offering a new level of professionalism, reliability and security to bitcoin trading,"" CEO Rich Teo and CTO Jason Melo of itBit told CoinDesk.  The recent round was funded by Canaan Partners and RRE Ventures, along with Liberty City ventures and other individual angel investors. itBit is bringing NASDAQ’s exchange technology to bitcoin.  Existing and previous digital currency exchanges have experienced severe technical issues in terms of security and reliability.  The company representatives said:  “The NASDAQ's open source exchange technology allows itBit to plug bitcoin into the broader and established financial services ecosystem. The NASDAQ technology also affords us extremely performant and low latent connectivity to our market maker and other institutional players.""  The firm's aim is to attract investors outside of the retail brokerage investing market for the time being. Teo and Melo said itBit uses a process to verify accredited investors.  “In the US, customers must be incorporated businesses, and we manually review each application on a case-by-case basis. We err on the side of caution to always ensure that we are operating within the bounds of current regulation,"" they explained.  There are a number of companies that are currently trying to bring bitcoin investing and trading to the mass market. Coinsetter, a startup that received $500,000 in funding earlier this year, is building a Forex-style platform for trading bitcoins.  Vaurum  , which is a Boost VC-backed company, has been building an engine that traditional brokerages might use to bring retail investors better access to virtual currencies.  While there are other valuable distributed ecurrencies out there, itBit is focusing its efforts just on bitcoin for the time being. The company members said:  “We are keeping an eye on other currencies but don't have a roadmap to share yet on how they might be integrated. Right now we are quite focused on bitcoin.""  They believe that Singapore, known as a financial hub for Asian markets, is the best place to build their bitcoin company.  “Singapore's regulators are very advanced and forward-looking, and are on the forefront of financial innovation.We chose to be headquartered in Singapore because it is a country that meets two major criteria for us,"" the company’s leadership added.  ""One, Singapore is a FATF-compliant country, meaning that is recognized as complying with internationally-endorsed standards for combating threats to the integrity of the international financial system. Two, it has regulatory and banking systems in place that are friendly to a bitcoin-related business such as ours. We have a great relationship with the Monetary Authority of Singapore,"" they concluded.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/11/itbit-raises-325-million-to-build-finance-grade-bitcoin-trading-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2feb76bda8104972e600a1183de884fb108d36f-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376666,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6be6p,1384190114,$4.1 Million goes missing as Chinese bitcoin trading platform GBL vanishes,"Bitcoin is surging in China, but the explosion in digital currency trading has been accompanied by possible fraud and theft.  GBL, a Chinese bitcoin trading platform that claimed to be based in Hong Kong, recently shut down – an event that might not be worthy of note had ¥25m ($4.1m) worth of users’ money not disappeared with it.  The company appears to have launched in May 2013, with its domain btc-glb.com registered on 9th May and a post later that month by Bitcoin Talk forum user zhaoxianpeng promoting the site.  Suspicions  Commenters were instantly suspicious, noting that the site’s server was based in Beijing despite the site's claim to being based in Hong Kong.  They also pointed out that GBL hadn’t provided straightforward contact information on their site and that the platform used a patchwork of information lifted from other websites.  Those weren’t the only warning signs. According to WantChinaTimes.com, which quotes a report from Chinese newspaper Southern Weekly, GBL registered as a company with the Hong Kong authorities on 10th June but never received a license for financial services.  Despite these concerns, it seems GBL was able to attract 1,000 mainland investors, according to a report from Hong Kong-based newspaper The Standard.  The forum thread now has a large red warning notice from a moderator at the top that reads: “Be careful scam.”  By September, GBL began issuing stock to its users, and in early October it was capping the amount of money users could cash out. Those actions could have been to maximize the amount of money it held.  Without a trace  Soon after, on 26th October, GBL shut down and vanished without a trace.  The address listed on its website proved to be a fake – “the office listed on its website […] turned out to be a false address,” reports The Standard – and the Hong Kong police have now been involved.  Bitcoin’s history is littered with these kinds of stories, which appear to show behaviour that is not entirely above board.  This list  gives some sense of the number of times bitcoiners have been persuaded to part with their money, only to find that, whether by malice or by incompetence, they couldn’t get it back.  The theft of over a million dollars worth of bitcoin from Australian wallet service Inputs.io is probably the most recent infamous case.  Inputs.io may have been a case of incompetence, with some questioning whether the service did enough to secure its users bitcoins.  Malice  With GBL, the evidence points towards malice but the warning signs were there. For 1,000 investors, though, the excitement of getting on the bitcoin gravy train seems to have suppressed their better judgement.  Just over a week ago, BTC China, the first trading platform to trade bitcoins for Chinese yuan, shot past Mt. Gox to momentarily become the world’s number one bitcoin exchange and, on the ground, businesses are beginning to awaken to the digital currency’s potential, with a bar in Beijing leading the field by becoming the first in China to accept bitcoin.  In the land of the “Great Firewall”, the success of bitcoin, the currency of the Internet, is obviously attracting a great deal of attention.  Like elsewhere, it seems it is also attracting sharks ready to take your money if you’re not careful.

42376669,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6be9L,1384182350,US Homeland Security committee to explore bitcoin's potential in 18th Nov hearing,"The US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has set 18th November as the date for its hearing into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  US Senator Tom Carper, chairman of the committee, said last week that the aim of the hearing, titled 'Beyond Silk Road: potential risks, threats, and promises of virtual currencies', is to ""dig into what a whole-government approach to this new and unique technology may look like”.  According to a post on the Bitcoin Talk forum, several people representing bitcoin interests have been invited to testify, including members of the Bitcoin Foundation.  The hearing will feature two separate panels, one representing US law enforcement agencies and another representing bitcoin, extolling the virtues of digital currencies.  The US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs is also soon to hold a hearing about bitcoin, although the exact date of this is yet to be made public.  Several commenters on the Bitcoin Talk forum questioned the need for bitcoin community cooperation with government and the willingness to offer up information on bitcoin's inner workings.  Others stressed that, while bitcoin itself is decentralized and independent, to function in the real-world economy it also needs to integrate with widely-used (and regulated) infrastructures and fiat currencies.  The Bitcoin Foundation's law and policy committee chair Mike Hearn wrote:  ""There are many powerful institutions in our world run by people that simply don't or won't take part in forums like Bitcoin Talk, mailing lists and so on. The way they operate is by holding meetings, conferences and hearings like this one. The foundation not only funds development but acts as a bridge between these two very different worlds.""  The US Senate has shown an interest in bitcoin for some time now, having begun its inquiry in early August. US authorities have so far adopted a neutral approach to cryptocurrencies, with a letter from Homeland Security stating:  ""As with all emerging technologies, the federal government must make sure that potential threats and risks are dealt with swiftly; however, we must also ensure that rash or uninformed actions don’t stifle a potentially valuable technology.""  Those speaking at the hearing next week on behalf of bitcoin will try their best to ensure the government realises the many benefits and opportunities digital currency offers while arguing against any protestations that it is damaging to society.

42376672,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6beD7,1384166751,Bitcoin exchange BTC China experiences all-time price high,"Chinese bitcoin exchange BTC China hit its all-time high at the weekend, trading bitcoin at ¥1,978 each.  The record surpasses the previous Chinese high of ¥1,944 back in April this year, which, although Western media generally quotes the Mt. Gox high of $265, was actually equivalent to approximately $308.  It seems the Chinese are willing to pay premium prices for their bitcoins, as exemplified by this recent breakout, with reports that much of the recent surge in the value of bitcoin can be attributed to the enthusiasm of Chinese traders.  The thirst of Chinese traders  BTC China  CEO Bobby Lee reports that his company is breaking records on a daily basis, crossing over into 90,000 in trade volume in one day, with their current spot price ¥2,942, 10% higher than the price on Bitstamp and 5% over Mt. Gox, which Lee says demonstrates how the thirst of Chinese traders is leading the market.  [post-quote]  “This is similar to what happened in April, where we saw trading well above $265 for over 12 hours. This time, it seems to be lasting longer. We hope that, this time, there won't be such a severe price correction as in April,"" he said.  Lee recently told Forbes that BTC China's recent elimination of trading fees helped to boost interest in bitcoin. ""It was a strategic move to increase trading in China and draw people to our site,"" he said, and it appears to have worked.  When asked about why people in China are suddenly so interested in bitcoin, he responded: ""China has been known as a nation of savers, who are always saving for a rainy day. Bitcoin is a digital asset, like real estate, gold, or stock. It is just one more option now. With Bitcoin hard-coded to be limited, it's like a collectible.""  Bitcoin for real estate  Another factor in the story of bitcoin's rise to prominence in China is the revelation that real estate is moving into the bitcoin space too, with Finextra reporting that Chinese IT giant Shanda's real estate development arm is offering its new apartments in exchange for bitcoin as part of a new promotion in Zhangjiang Hi-Tech park in Shanghai.  Some 300 apartments in soon-to-be-built buildings ranging from 42-81sqm were made available to buy at around 800 to 1,000 BTC each, at a fixed exchange rate of ¥1,000 per bitcoin. They all sold out in only a few minutes.  This is an example of how bitcoins can be applied to any industry, but Lee is quick to point out there aren't many businesses in China that accept bitcoin yet, and it is still largely a vehicle of investment and speculation. He said that, while bitcoin is still legally a grey area in China, ""the government and banks are less afraid of grey area businesses than those in the US are"".  ""The law has not caught up with technology. I want China to re-evaluate its laws so we can classify bitcoin and the government can regulate it,"" Lee concluded.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Richard Boase,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/11/bitcoin-exchange-btc-china-experiences-all-time-price-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/015c8f6c1c89a13625fb0b0679ffa567224f8eec-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
