42427143,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzo3h,1478903958,Bitcoin Wasn't the Only Digital Currency to See Post-Election Bounce,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the digital currency markets, and the technology's use as an asset class.  This articles covers 4th November to 11th November, 2016.  The surprise US Presidential Election results pushed bitcoin 4% higher this week amid a choppy period for the digital currency markets.  After opening at roughly $709 on 4th November, bitcoin neared $740, placing it within reach of its 2016 high of more than $780. But while this increase was notable, it fell short of some forecasts.  Cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff, for example, noted that he expected bitcoin prices to benefit more starkly from the uncertainty created by the election.  As previously profiled on CoinDesk, many analysts had expected a 'Brexit-like' impact, one in which the digital currency might have risen by as much as $100 on a Trump win. When it became clear that the Brexit referendum would succeed, bitcoin prices surged, rising above $650 on 24th June after falling to $550 the day before.  Eliosoff told CoinDesk.  ""The election reaction has been more nuanced than some of us foresaw – on a Trump win, I expected BTC to shoot up and stay there.""  Overall, bitcoin finished the week at $713.67, 3.8% higher than its opening price, but if the markets are any indication, investors may have used the proceeds to seek profit elsewhere.  Monero gains  The privacy-oriented digital currency Monero, for example, surged more than 20% from $4.99 to $6.13 over the course of the week, Poloniex figures reveal.  Monero enjoyed these sharp gains as Zcash, another digital currency that has focused on offering improved privacy features, plunged close to 75% during the period.  While Zcash enjoyed a huge spike in prices at launch in October, the currency has fallen sharply since then, finishing the week at $225.74 after starting out the period at $900.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, believes that the results are evidence that Monero is becoming an interesting asset for traders, and that there is a developing dynamic between the two competing platforms.  ""As other cryptos lost ground, more money went into XMR, especially after its decline last week. XMR price has recovered and still seems to appeal to a large market on the dark web,"" he said.  Eliosoff also weighed in on the situation, telling CoinDesk that ZEC's steadily growing supply may be related to Monero's rally.  ""The total ZEC supply is still increasing very quickly every week, which means more sellers and a dropping price,"" he added, noting that these sellers may be putting their money into Monero.  It is worth noting that while Zcash harnesses bleeding-edge cryptography in an effort to ensure privacy, Monero has thus far achieved far greater adoption on the dark web, a network of websites where buyers could benefit greatly from anonymous transactions.  In contrast, Monero has been around since 2014, so it has had more time to undergo testing.  Ethereums see volatility  Elsewhere, ether and ether classic experienced some mild volatility.  Ether fell slightly, dropping from $10.83 to $10.52 to finish the period with a loss of less than 3%, according to Poloniex. Ether classic went in the other direction, rising roughly 6% from 0.082 BTC to 0.087 BTC.  Analysts seemed uncertain as to the reason for ether classic's boost, though at least one major exchange (China-based BTCC) did express interest in listing the digital currency.

42427155,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoTh,1478901612,Bitcoin Startup Blockstream Seeking Patent for Sidechains Design,"The US Patent and Trademark Office (USTPO) has published a patent application submitted by bitcoin startup Blockstream related to its work on sidechains.  The application, submitted on 9th May and published earlier this week, outlines “systems and methods...for transferring an asset from a parent chain to a sidechain”. It names Blockstream CEO Adam Back and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell (who is also a Core contributor) as inventors. Sidechains are envisioned as a way to allow the movement of digital assets from one blockchain to another, opening the door to new kinds of applications and experiments using the tech.  The application’s release comes months after the startup announced a patent pledge, saying at the time that it would make its patents and applications available under the Defensive Patent License. The application outlines how assets could be exchange between a primary blockchain and a sidechain to which it is connected, explaining:  “A simplified payment verification (SPV) proof associated with the parent chain asset may be generated. The SPV proof may include a threshold level of work. The SPV proof associated with the parent chain asset may be validated, and a sidechain asset corresponding to the parent chain asset may be generated. If no reorganization proof is detected, the sidechain asset is released.”  Blockstream released its first open-source code for sidechains last summer, later moving to debut a sidechains projects dubbed Liquid aimed at bitcoin exchanges.  The startup raised $55m in a Series A funding round in February, and in July acquired bitcoin wallet startup GreenAddress in a bid to boost its development of sidechains.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream.  Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly reported that Adam Back was a contributor to the Bitcoin Core development team. The article has been updated to remove this inaccuracy.

42427149,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoHh,1478897460,Hong Kong Central Bank: Blockchain Holds 'Enormous Potential',"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has published a new white paper on distributed ledger tech.  The HKMA, which is Hong Kong’s de facto central bank, produced the paper in partnership with the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI).  The move comes just over two months after the two sides began collaborating on blockchain applications, a process that has seen activity amongst Hong Kong banks looking to build a system for sharing mortgage valuations.  The HKMA is one of a growing body of central banks experimenting with or exploring applications. In the past year, central banks from Russia, Canada and the United Kingdom, among others, have actively tested the tech for uses in the areas of electronic money and document validation.  The paper constitutes a broad overview of the tech, offering a top-down look at some of the use cases the HKMA has examined in partnership with ASTRI. Overall, the paper presents blockchain as a tool that “carries enormous potential” depending on the kind of application.  “The potential applications of DLT, as the fintech industry and many central banks and regulatory authorities soon found, are not limited to dealing in virtual currencies or commodities. The very fact that DLT allows information or records to be transferred and updated by network participants, and this to be done in a trustworthy, secure and efficient way, carries enormous potential.”  Though largely striking a positive tone about the tech, the paper’s authors note that, from the regulatory perspective, risks remain. Specifically, the paper highlights the risk of public blockchains being used to launder funds.  “The possible risks involved in operating such platforms should not be underestimated,” it states. “These may include operational risks, cyber attacks, and money laundering issues.  Looking ahead  The white paper release is only the first step in a wider process, officials in Hong Kong say.  During an event held earlier today, HKMA chief executive Norman Chan said the government is planning further research. ASTRI is looking to publish a follow-up paper sometime in the middle of next year, building on its past findings and exploring “whether some of this work can be put into action”, Chan explained.  Coinciding with the white paper release is the official launch of a fintech innovation hub, which, according to Chan, will serve as a test bed for continued experimentations between Hong Kong’s financial firms, startup companies and regulators.  “The Hub is equipped with high-powered computing resources and supported by the experts at ASTRI to allow banks, payment service providers, fintech firms and the HKMA to brainstorm innovative ideas, try out and evaluate new fintech solutions in a safe and efficient manner,” he said.  Chan added that its regulatory sandbox, which hosted the mortgage valuation system trials, is expected to add more financial institutions in the months ahead.

42427147,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzoBh,1478886312,One in Four Bitcoin Nodes Are Now Upgraded for SegWit,"Bitcoin network data shows that 25% of nodes worldwide are now running code for Segregated Witness.  Proposed late last year as a means to scale the bitcoin network, the upgrade was released last month by the volunteer development community Bitcoin Core in its latest software version. SegWit was put forward in a bid to increase the network’s transaction capacity without increasing the block size limit, drawing both praise and criticism from some quarters of the community amid a contentious debate.  Network data suggests that the software version including SegWit is now the most commonly used among note operators.  Bitnodes reports  that just over 25% of bitcoin nodes are running on the latest Core software – 0.13.1 – which includes the code for SegWit. By the data service's count, that's 1,362 nodes out of a total of 5,436 nodes connected to the bitcoin network that are now prepared for the upgrade.  By comparison, 1,204 nodes, roughly 22% of the network, is running version 0.12.1, with 964 or nearly 18% running on 0.13.0.  Alternative bitcoin implementation Bitcoin Unlimited, which allows operators to set their own variable block size, is being run by 5.6% of the network, or 306 nodes, according to the data.  Despite support from a quarter of all nodes, SegWit isn’t yet activated across the network. In order for that to take place, 95% of all bitcoin miners need to adopt the software, followed by a grace period constituting 2,016 transaction blocks.  The process for actually signaling support for SegWit is expected to begin sometime around 19th November on the first network difficulty retarget after the 15th of this month. In the meantime, bitcoin wallet providers and other companies have begun laying the groundwork for supporting the upgrade.  The development is notable, as some in the bitcoin mining space have pledged to block the proposal unless there is movement on a bid to increase the block size.

42399478,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjF9j,1478877476,R3 Banks Trial Blockchain Identity Registry,"Ten global banks have tested a distributed ledger-based know-your-customer registry through the R3 blockchain consortium.  BBVA, CIBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, Natixis, Nordea, Northern Trust, Société Générale, UBS and US Bank took part in the three-month initiative, R3 said earlier this week. The registry enabled the banks involved to create and manage digital identities within a shared system, providing a mechanism for adhering to KYC regulations in the finance space.  The startup said of the test:  “The project simulated establishing the identity of both a legal entity and an individual using KYC data and identity attestations by third-parties.”  News of the trial comes days after R3 kicked off a new research outfit in partnership with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state’s central bank. That effort is aimed at creating a test environment for blockchain applications, as well as a hub for financial institutions in the region looking to explore the tech.  The past two months have seen consortium members conduct trials using distributed ledger startup Ripple’s digital asset, XRP, as well as a platform developed by tech giant Intel.

42399491,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFLX,1478874712,The Long Disrupt: How Blockchain Startups Are Reshaping the DTCC,"Robert Palatnick has no delusions about the changing role of the DTCC, a centralized transaction processing firm that has recently been in the crosshairs of blockchain disruptors.  Yet, the chief technology architect at the post-trade services behemoth (it processes $1.5qn in annual transactions) tells CoinDesk the DTCC's strengths in risk management are no less important in a blockchain world. What will change, he now believes, is the technology the company employs.  While some startups using distributed ledger technology are working to undermine centralized transactions processors, others have joined in the fight to modernize the existing infrastructure.  In conversation, Palatnick explained how by partnering with these startups, the DTCC can better focus its efforts on making sure what's created complies with the immense burden of financial regulations.  Palatnick said:  ""To build the pyramids, flexible pyramids, updatable and renewable, these things that will contain the assets that allow the markets to function and allow liquidity to happen and allow firms to finance themselves and allows startups to go public. That’s our role.""  So far, the DTCC has publicly announced its work with two Wall Street startups, Axoni and Digital Asset. But Palatnick says they're ""in different levels of conversations"" with at least a half dozen others.  The DTCC announced its first collaboration with a startup with Digital Asset in March. The private blockchain trial was designed to show that distributed ledgers could bring efficiency to the market for repurchasing agreements, which accounts for an estimated $2.3tn in transactions daily.  But this blending of expertise and experience between the two companies is about more than quickly getting a product to market, according to Chris Church, chief business development officer of Digital Asset.  ""We expect the results will provide capabilities at a lower cost and with a longer-term strategic benefit to the DTCC,"" he said.  After the initial test with DA, Palatnick said the DTCC had entered into conversations with other potential partners to explore creating solutions for additional asset classes. The following month, the DTCC revealed that the partnership with Axoni had resulted in the successful tests of 85 structured use cases for blockchain applications in credit default swaps.  Currently, Palatnick says he is in conversation with ""more startups than ever in DTCC's history.""  Startup appeal  Rather than try to become a specialist in cryptography, Palatnik said the DTCC wants to leverage its existing risk management strengths.  As a result, he says he's focused primarily on companies with a strong background in the technological aspects of blockchain.  That said, in an increasingly competitive space, the startups that distinguish themselves understand both the ""tool and the transaction,"" he said.  This strategy of focusing on the strengths of the startups and not overextending DTCC’s original mission has resulted in some surprising turns of event.  Palatnick said:  ""Once they realize we have people who deal with regulators and deal with the regulation of our code, [and] that that's what it means to get into this business, they’re suddenly interested in becoming a software provider to us.""  Caught in the middle  But not every blockchain startup wants to work with the DTCC.  Founded in its current incarnation in 1999 after the merger of The Depository Trust Company (DTC) and National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), the firm helps financial institutions settle their transactions in an average of three days depending on the trade.  But the firm has also faced several lawsuits alleging it had sold shares in stock without first procuring a borrow, a controversial process called a ""naked short sale"".  Utah-based retailer Overstock, for example, founded its Medici blockchain division in 2014 and it now has the DTCC square in its sites.  Not only does Medici aim to close the settlement time from three days to zero, but it wants to prevent naked short-sells by ensuring companies like the DTCC are actually in possession of the shares they trade.  A recent CoinDesk opinion piece proposed that Medici’s services could ""give back title in shares to shareholders instead of the DTCC.""  Uphill battle  In this way, the DTCC is not alone in being at a bit of a crossroads.  Like many, it's chosen to join the numerous financial middlemen that have responded to pressure from blockchain innovations by embracing partnerships with startups.  But Palatnick wants to embrace blockchain disruption in more than just one way, as he wrote earlier this year. So, in addition to increasing the DTCC’s collaboration with startups, an interest in open-source collaboration is now a pre-requisite for aspiring partners.  Each of the companies with which Palatnick negotiates are either already members of open-source blockchain project Hyperledger, or they have committed to be join, he said.  ""That's very important to us,"" he added.  Selling the goods  The strategy seems to be working.  The firm’s Trade Information Warehouse blockchain prototype is now ""past proof-of-concept point"" and is ""getting close to being finalized.""  Palatnick says his team is currently in ""conversations with various vendors"" interested in using the repo product built with Digital Asset.  Yet, the chief technollgy architect acknowledges the changes have gone beyond technology.  He summed up the evolution of the DTCC, adding:  ""It’s so out of character for our history to be going down that path. But it tells you the technology is on this curve because so many people are contributing back.""

42399482,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFDf,1478872914,Blockchain Startup Adds UK Cybersecurity Expert to Board,"A former official for the UK’s Foreign Office has joined the board of blockchain startup Setl.  Martin Clements served as director general for technology and transformation at the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Clements is the second high-profile UK official to join Setl’s board in the past year. Last December, the startup named former executive director of the Bank of England Sir David Walker as its chairman.  The announcement follows news that Setl is one of a group of blockchain startups recently greenlit for the startup ‘sandbox’ launched by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a finance regulator in the UK. That effort was launched in order to provide a basis for startups to test new – and potentially risky – technologies under supervision.  According to the startup, Clements will advise the startup on technology issues, drawing from his work in the areas of national and cybersecurity while working for the UK government.  Setl CEO Peter Randall said in a statement:  “We are in no doubt as to the importance of system resilience and cyber security in the payments and settlements world and the appointment of Martin is an indication that SETL will deal with these matters at board level.”  The hire is a notable example of a UK government official entering the blockchain space. For much of the past year, various agencies within the government have moved to test or support blockchain applications, following recommendations from its chief science advisor that it actively pursue ways to trial and explore the tech.

42399502,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFNV,1478869148,Blockchain for CPU? Analyzing Golem's Ethereum Token Sale,"Alex Sunnarborg is the founder of Lawnmower, a blockchain investing and market data platform founded in 2015. Here Sunnarborg takes an in-depth look at the imminent crowdfunding effort by Golem, an ethereum-based market for computer processing power, which launches today.  This publication is not intended to constitute investment advice. Please consider all blockchain investments with caution.  Golem  , one of the latest ethereum-based projects and blockchain assets, is set to begin its public crowdfunding today.  Often described as “Airbnb for computers”, the Golem team intends to use the funding to build out a network for renting unused computing power (CPU or GPU cycles) amongst users, existing as decentralized, open-source software on the ethereum blockchain.  As a two-sided market, Golem allows users to either:  Sell unused computational resources (CPU or GPU time) to others, or  Buy unused computational resources (CPU or GPU time) from others.  As consumers' and businesses' requirements for processing power differ greatly, Golem looks to take advantage of the varying needs of end users and tasks to create an alternative cloud computing network and market.  As an example of the stark contrast in computational needs, imagine someone who uses their computer primarily for Facebook and email as compared to someone who frequently uses one for work or research related to resource-heavy fields and tasks like high definition image rendering, stock market simulations and back-testing, DNA analysis, machine learning or big data.  The Facebook and email user likely uses their computer’s CPU or GPU to nowhere near their capacity, and could use Golem to sell processing time directly to a user who likely often needs to shop around for additional computational resources during periods of heavy analysis, and currently may turn to services and corporate giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM.  The marketplace is anticipated to include individuals, organizations, data centers, and more, and allow for complete flexibility and customization for both buyers and sellers on terms including price, time or task, and amount or percent of resources.  Funding targets  The upcoming crowdfunding is for a token on the ethereum platform called the Golem Network Token (GNT), intended to be core to Golem and “ensure flexibility and control over the future evolution of the project and attributed to a variety of functions in the Golem network following the first major release” (including being the only type of payment permitted for buying computing resources).  The crowdfunding for GNT will last three weeks, or until 820,000 Ether (ETH) is raised. If less than 150,000 ETH are raised in three weeks, the crowdfunding will be deemed a failure and the ETH will be returned to the original owners.  Given the popularity, consumer demand, and speed of successful recent public blockchain asset crowdfunding efforts (especially on ethereum), it’s an interesting time to look at some of the similarities and differences in the structuring of the assets in this new trend or alternative fundraising paradigm.  Instead of birthing a new asset and blockchain with an initial genesis block and the subsequent start of competitive mining like with bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC), or more recently, Zcash (ZEC), 100% of the supply of GNT to ever exist will be allocated and distributed immediately following the closing of the crowdfunding – similar to Digix DAO (DGD), SingularDTV (SNGLS), or First Blood (1SŦ).  As ethereum-based blockchain assets with public crowdfunding projects this year, the demand for these tokens are extremely relevant data points. Further, DGD, SNGLS, and 1SŦ had maximum fundraising caps similar to GNT:  In March, DGD received $5.5 million of ETH in 12 hours  In September, 1SŦ received $5.5 million of ETH in 5 minutes  In October, SNGLS received $7.5 million of ETH in 15 minutes  In November, GNT will attempt to receive $10 million of ETH.  Given the massive demand and blazing speed for these crowdfunding efforts, GNT may similarly see enormous initial interest and an extremely small time window in which Ether deposits will be accepted in exchange for an initial GNT allocation.  For some additional data points, many ethereum based projects have alternatively opted to raise funds with no concept of a maximum cap:  In late 2014, ethereum (ETH) itself raised $18.4 million in 41 days  In late 2015, Augur (REP) raised $5.3 million in 45 days  In late 2016, Iconomi (ICN) raised $10.6 million in 35 days.  Further crowdfunding attempts in the blockchain space are not only carried out via ethereum. Both Lisk (LSK) and Waves (WAVES) actually compete with ethereum as decentralized app platforms upon which developers can create and deploy software, and each also had their own uncapped public crowdsale earlier this year.  In early 2016, Lisk (LSK) raised $5.7 million in 28 days  In mid 2016, Waves (WAVES) raised $16.1 million in 50 days.  During Golem’s crowdfunding, GNT will be available for purchase at an exchange rate of 1,000 GNT for 1 ETH. Given the 820,000 ETH cap, 820 million GNT are available for participants, which will be available for trading immediately after the end of the crowdsale.  This straightforward approach contrasts somewhat with the more creative structure we saw recently in the 1SŦ crowdsale and its moving pricing that awarded early participation with a better exchange rate that may have heavily influenced the extremely early demand and closing. Also of note, 1SŦ were set to be non-transferable for two months following the crowdfunding, delaying attempts to quickly sell the asset after initially buying in.  The GNT generated by ETH sent during the crowdfunding process are set to represent 82% of the overall supply of GNT. Regardless of the level of funding, after the crowdfunding period has ended, additional GNT shall be created and distributed such that 12% of the overall supply will be allocated to Golem Factory GmbH (the company behind Golem, intended to be incorporated in Switzerland), and 6% to team members and early contributors.  Unlike the GNT allocated to crowdfunding participants upon the closing of the sale, the 18% of GNT pre-allocated to Golem, team members, and early contributors is locked (non-transferable) for six months after the creation period ends. Thus, initial selling volume on exchanges will be at the hands of crowdsale participants only.  Along with the raised ETH, the 12% of GNT created allocated to the Factory (a maximum of 120 million GNT, worth 120,000 ETH or about $1.3 million) is intended to supply the company with the funding to develop and execute the overall Golem project, with a slightly flexible budget structure, go-to-market strategy, and development roadmap and timeline depending on the success of the fundraising.  The Golem project is generally designed around four main phases, the “Brass”, “Clay”, “Stone”, and “Iron” Golems – all methodically building upon each other and the overall vision.  Golem has also supplied some detail of their actual expected expenses given the minimum (150,000 ETH) and maximum (820,000 ETH) crowdfunding results, stating that if the cap is reached, they “will be able to finance team of 20 people (most of them developers) for a period of 4 years” (with offices in Zug, Switzerland and Warsaw, Poland).  Given 820,000 raised ETH plus 120 million GNT to the company (worth about $11.3 million combined at current prices), the team of 20 would be allocated 54%, or $6.1 million, of which each would receive $305,000 on average, or about $76,000 per year. However, Golem’s plan to sell or hold ETH or GNT over the life of the project, and questions around the timing and assets they would sell into are currently unknown.  The team behind Golem consists of the founders of imapp (in Poland), a CEO, CTO, and COO (also founders) with masters degrees in economics, math, and computer science from the Warsaw School of Economics and the University of Warsaw, and numerous additional developers from Poland with deep experience in technology and working with ethereum.  The value behind GNT is based on a wide variety of factors, and of course, as Golem clearly sets out, no user should be “submitting ETH to obtain GNT for the purpose of speculative investment”, and rather “is purchasing the functionality of the GNT issued primarily to support the development, testing, deployment and operation of the project”.  Given the inherent opaqueness of the conservative legalese, Golem published a recent blog post entitled “The Economics of the Golem Network Token”. As stated previously, GNT will be necessary to interact with Golem, initially to enable the transfer of value from the buyers of unused processing time to the providers and to software developers, and later (in the Stone and Iron phases) “to assign additional attributes to the token, so that, for example, it is required to store deposits in GNT”.  The Golem team cites the “quantity theory of money”, stating “the general price level of goods and services is directly proportional to the amount of money in circulation”, and since GNT is fixed in volume after the crowdfunding, a growing demand for GNT should increase the number of transactions on the network, and thus the price of the asset over time.  For some more quantitative and data driven metrics, they turn to market size numbers for Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS) within the cloud computing sector, stating a combined value of $64 billion ($37.7bn for SaaS on the cloud and $27bn for IaaS and PaaS on the cloud).  As Golem wishes to “create an almost perfectly competitive market for computing and software”, it believes it can take a piece of this pie, starting with “low hanging fruits” like CGI rendering (of which they estimate public cloud rendering as a $200m market), before tackling other promising computing-intensive applications like machine learning and scientific computing.  Challenges ahead  They continue on to claim these markets are however only the beginning, and “what is really important down the road, are microservices and the ‘true cloud’ functionality, which will allow Golem to offer features similar to what is offered by public cloud services today”.  The Golem team is not shy about its challenges ahead either, and has dedicated another entire blog post and section of their GNT terms to their risks and hurdles as well, including creating a P2P network, defining and verifying tasks, creating a unique transaction system, building a reputation system, handling running untrusted code, potential overall Golem and ethereum software weaknesses, regulatory uncertainty, and more.  Additional questions and concerns I would bring up include ideas such as:  What happens if the company needs additional funding? As the GNT supply will exist in full after the initial crowdfunding, would Golem try to secure further funding in an alternative fashion like raising money for corporate debt or equity?  What will the company do with the initially allocated GNT after the six-month lock up? Is there some plan or methodology to evaluate how to allocate the corporate funds and overall portfolio, for example selling GNT over time into another blockchain asset or local sovereign currency?  Are there any further numbers on relevant market sizes, the current pricing landscape for traditional cloud computing providers like Amazon and Microsoft, comparisons to Golem expectations, or any quantitative projections on early usage, growth, or otherwise?
