Currently near $23,000, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was on track to close out the week down 2%.  BTC’s price move came on the heels of a surprisingly strong U.S. jobs report, spoken about in greater depth and detail in CoinDesk’s coverage of the announcement.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Bitcoin’s immediate response to the positive data was to sell off briefly, before recovering throughout the day.  Given the strength of the report, bitcoin investors may anticipate that the Federal Open Market Committee – the Federal Reserve’s monetary-policy panel – will maintain its elevated pace of interest rate increases, which could have a negative impact on asset prices.  In traditional markets, the S&P 500 declined 0.2%, while the tech-laden Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.2% higher.  Altcoins pushed higher as well, as Polkadot’s DOT advanced 6.3%, while Avalanche’s AVAX increased 4.4%.  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $22,898 +2.0%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,677 +5.6%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,145.19 −0.2%      ●Gold: $1,791 per troy ounce +0.2%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.84% +0.2       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  BTC Initial Reaction to Positive Jobs Data Was Negative  Where the July 29 Market Wrap took a step out to the weekly chart time frame, today’s chart zooms into a narrower hourly chart range. Doing so can provide increased line of sight into the intra-day reaction to economic data.  Friday morning’s U.S. jobs report for July massively surpassed expectations, as employment rose by 528,000 compared to a consensus forecast of a 250,000 increase. The unemployment rate decreased to 3.5% versus expectations for 3.6%.  This, by most accounts, was a strong jobs report. Bitcoin’s hourly chart, however, implies a different interpretation.  BTC prices declined close to 2% on above-average volume not long after the employment report was released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Prices have since recovered, with BTC currently trading above $23,000.  That might signal at least a brief departure from the market realm where “good news = bad news” for markets, and vice versa. Specifically, positive economic data gives the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee room to take a more aggressive approach to future rate increases.  Notably, the probabilities for a 75 basis point increase in interest rates in September have increased from 34% to 65%, following the report. A glance at the daily chart (below) shows a recovery in prices throughout the remainder of the day.  The ATR (average true range) indicator illustrates a continued reduction in volatility, while the relative strength index (RSI) shows an uptick to 53, which (while higher) is generally interpreted as neutral.  The RSI indicator, for context, is often used as a proxy for momentum, with a reading of 30 indicating oversold levels and 70 indicating overbought levels.  BTC’s seven-day performance shows relatively little movement overall  Overall, the seven-day movement in the price of BTC was relatively flat. Price action stalled substantially from the double-digit gains for both BTC and ETH in the week prior.  The same can be said for traditional risk assets and equities indexes. The largest movement in prices over the most recent seven days occurred in energy markets, with crude oil declining by 8%. Thirty-day correlations between BTC and traditional stock indexes remain fairly tight.

The metric works by looking at the history of each coin being sold on the chain to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous selling price was less than the latest BTC value, then the coin has just been sold at a profit. While if the last value was more than the current one, then that particular coin realized some loss. When the value of the SOPR is greater than one, it means the market as a whole is selling at a profit right now.

42411750,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgVG,1659725874,Polkadot 101: Connecting the Dots for Beginners,"As the cryptocurrency space exploded, thousands of new projects with distinct blockchains were created. But while many of these blockchains sought to solve unique problems or serve specific functions, most of them were completely walled off and had no way to communicate or connect with one another. Polkadot is a project that aims to fix that problem.  Polkadot is a blockchain interoperability protocol designed to enable communication among different blockchains.  Overview of Polkadot  Gavin Wood founded the project in 2016, which launched alongside its native token, DOT, in October 2017. The open-source project is developed by the community and supported by the Web3 Foundation. In line with the beliefs of the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot aims to make all blockchains interoperable and create a truly decentralized system where users are in control.  Before founding Polkadot and developing the blockchain at Parity, Wood was a co-founder of Ethereum. While working on Ethereum, Wood helped develop Ethereum’s programming language Solidity as well as defined the technical language of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Wood’s work on the Ethereum white paper and programming language is reflected in both the Polkadot white paper and the main programming framework for Polkadot development, Substrate.  DOT, the native token for the Polkadot ecosystem, is used to facilitate transactions on the Polkadot network. Polkadot network participants are also empowered through DOT to participate in governance and validator voting. The token is among the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At the time of writing, the crypto asset has a total supply of 1.7B DOT and a nearly $10 billion market cap. Because DOT does not have a hard limit on its total supply, new DOT will continually be added to the supply at an annual rate of around 10%.  What makes Polkadot unique?  Polkadot was created with the goal of creating an interoperable ecosystem for all blockchains and decentralized app (dapp) platforms. The goal Polkadot wants to achieve already sets it apart from many other blockchains under development, but Polkadot stands out for a variety of other reasons as well:  Multichain: Polkadot is a multichain, “layer 0” blockchain that creates a framework for other blockchains to communicate.  Parallel processing: Instead of handling one transaction at a time, Polkadot can validate multiple transactions and operate under different functions simultaneously.  Twin bockchain: Polkadot has a twin blockchain, Kusama (KSM), that shares the same codebase as Polkadot, but is on its own independent mainnet.  GRANDPA: Polkadot’s original consensus algorithm, GRANDPA is based on the nominated-proof-of-stake (NPoS) model of consensus.  Multichain  One key difference that sets Polkadot apart from other blockchains is that it is a multichain. Often described as a layer 0 blockchain, Polkadot creates the infrastructure for other blockchains to build on through two key developments: the relay chain and parachains.  Parachains, or parallel blockchains, are interconnected blockchains that help bridge Polkadot to external chains and communicate with one another through the relay chain. The relay chain is responsible for reaching consensus and providing cross-chain interoperability among the different blockchains. Since the relay chain connects all parachains to the Polkadot blockchain, relay chains enable shared security, meaning all other chains are equally as secure as Polkadot.  Parallel processing  Another key difference between Polkadot and other blockchains is its ability to process transactions in parallel. Other blockchains – the Ethereum network, for example – executes transactions individually, which can lead to longer transaction times. To increase transaction speeds, Polkadot uses its parachains to spread transactions across the broader network.  Since parachains enable multiple blockchains to run within the Polkadot network, use-case specific tasks can be handled by one parachain, while the Polkadot chain and other parachains continue to handle others.  Twin blockchain  A third reason Polkadot is unique among other blockchains is its cousin: Kusama (KSM). Polkadot and Kusama both operate independently, but were built using the same codebase. Kusama is a “wild and fast” blockchain that lets users experiment with the ecosystem and test new updates to the code. Polkadot, on the other hand, is much more stable and improvements are rolled out more slowly.  Experimentation and development of the Kusama blockchain may make it seem like a testnet for Polkadot, but it is also a mainnet blockchain. This provides benefits to Polkadot for two reasons. First, Kusama’s fast-moving development lets Polkadot learn from its mistakes and implement upgrades when they’ve proven successful. Second, Kusama offers a lower barrier to entry for developers so they can launch successful projects prior to moving to Polkadot.  Though the twin blockchains started out from the same codebase, the different natures of the projects will slowly cause them to diverge in use. So the Kusama-Polkadot relationship not only helps build a more stable Polkadot blockchain but also makes for an interesting long-term experiment.  GRANDPA  Polkadot uses a modified version of the proof-of-stake consensus protocol known as nominated proof-of-stake. Under a traditional PoS model used by such blockchains as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), any network participant can validate transactions by meeting the blockchain’s requirements. Polkadot’s NPoS model instead lets participants use their tokens to vote on validators, and only those validators who have received enough backing can start validating transactions.  What makes Polkadot’s NPoS consensus unique from others is its original interpretation of the model known as GRANDPA. GRANDPA (GHOST-based recursive ancestor deriving prefix agreement). Instead of validating blocks at a fixed rate, GRANDPA serves in a more dynamic way and is capable of handling millions of blocks at once. In doing so, GRANDPA enables Polkadot to quickly settle transactions while the blockchain is operating smoothly and avoid network delays by catching up on transactions when it isn’t running as well.",POSITIVE,ADA | DOT,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | MARKET,Griffin Mcshane,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/polkadot-101-connecting-the-dots-for-beginners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0658bfaf28a35a1f7b086e32f94491ced0e9cad-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This long-awaited event in the Ethereum world will force the network's mining industry, which research firm Messari estimates is worth $19 billion, to find other ways to make money.  Pioneered by Bitcoin, mining is the process of verifying transactions and racing to solve complicated math problems for the right to record transactions on the blockchain. In return for dedicating time and resources to performing this task, winning miners receive a fixed amount of newly issued currency. The Merge will replace this recordkeeping system with staking, which requires less computational power and energy.  One option being bandied about for mining pools is to redirect their expensive and powerful specialized computers to Ethereum Classic. This is the splinter network that emerged from the 2016 hard fork, after a hack in which $60 million was stolen from one of the earliest decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) on the Ethereum network. Ethereum split into two chains. The new one, which rewrote history as if the DAO hack never happened, took the Ethereum name. The initial version continued on as Ethereum Classic.  Read more: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: What Is the Difference?  For most of its history, Ethereum Classic has operated in its namesake’s shadow. But last month, ETC, its native token, surged 150%, and its market cap as of Aug. 4 was about $5 billion (still dwarfed by nearly $200 billion for Ethereum proper).  Varying degree of concerns  Miners are signaling a variety of approaches to adapt to a post-Merge Ethereum.  AntPool, the mining pool affiliated with mining rig giant Bitmain, for instance, last month announced that it had invested $10 million into development and apps for Ethereum Classic, while Ethermine, the largest Ethereum mining pool, announced a beta version of EtherMine Staking, a staking pool service. Then, there were rumors that Ethereum miners would hard-fork, or make a radical change to, the network in protest of the Merge. But the likelihood of that happening and being successful is extremely slim.  Luxor Technology, the full-stack bitcoin (BTC) mining software and services provider, also has made investments in Ethereum mining, despite the upcoming possibility of a change of consensus mechanism.  Luxor put together a PoW advocacy group aimed at keeping the blockchain on this consensus mechanism, Ethan Vera, the co-founder and chief operating officer of Luxor, told CoinDesk.  Vera said that the group came to fruition because of concerns about the transition to PoS. “While there are varying degrees of concern, the commonality is that there has not been enough testing of PoS transition yet,” he noted.  “The chance of an unsuccessful Merge is non-zero, which is very worrying to people who have invested time, social and financial into Ethereum,” Vera said.  There are billions of dollars at stake, and the Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit that oversees network software development, is moving too fast in its process to switch to PoS, causing enormous risk for miners and those holding ETH, Vera added.  Although Vera said he believes Ethereum is best served on PoW, if the transition to PoS is successful his company “will be happy for the ecosystem and still supportive personally and as a company.” He added that “we are highly interested in Ethereum intellectually as a project and all the interesting applications built on it.”  Vera wouldn’t say whether Luxor believes Ethereum Classic would be a better alternative, just that it would coordinate with its partners to determine where its mining practices will turn.  ETC use case  Hive Blockchain (HIVE), the first publicly traded miner, also shared with CoinDesk its challenges with Ethereum in a post-Merge era. When asked whether Ethereum Classic would become more valuable for miners in a post-Merge era, Aydin Kilic, president and chief operating officer of Hive said that “this would depend on the use case of Ethereum Classic.”  “Currently, approximately 95% of the [decentralized finance] projects exist on the Ethereum blockchain. If [non-fungible token] and DeFi developers realize that a secure proof-of-work layer 1 blockchain is the best playing field for their code based projects, then we would expect to see a rise in applications on the Ethereum Classic blockchain,” Kilic said. He added that “we believe there is intrinsic value in a broadly decentralized proof-of-work coin, which Ethereum Classic stands to become, if the Merge does take place.”  So the jury is out on whether Ethereum Classic will gain in a post-Merge world. The only common thread seems to be that miners want Ethereum to succeed, regardless of what consensus mechanism they use, although they seem to prefer it to stay on a PoW mechanism.

42411422,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNeRV,1659722400,The Price for Crypto’s Recovery: A New Narrative,"In these tough times, a bit of historical perspective is useful. Let’s talk about Mt. Gox.  After the February 2014 collapse of the Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, the conventional wisdom was that its creditors, most of them retail users of the online trading platform, would be left with a pittance. Some 750,000 of customers’ bitcoins were missing, a pool that was then worth around $473 million and continuing to fall as the bitcoin market was contracting.  Fast forward to 2021, when creditors recouped 90% of the bitcoin. The value of those assets then was $9 billion. A 20-times gain.  Now, in the midst of a new crypto winter, the burning question is whether the creditors left in the red by the recent travails of Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and others can expect a similarly happy result.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Crypto markets have a history of rebounding from their most severe slumps to hit spectacular new highs a couple of years later. That was the case after Mt. Gox, and following the first winter in 2011 and the third one in 2018. The difference this time is that the broad macro trend of low interest rates and asset inflation that steered rivers of loose money into crypto speculation won’t be there. There is no guarantee that history will repeat.  Yet there’s no way around it: To go from winter to spring, we need at least some recovery in prices. After all, that’s how the wider economy has always gotten itself out of debt crises. The predictability of this occurrence has even given rise to a particular brand of investor: distressed debt buyers, otherwise known as vulture funds, which buy the assets of liquidity-desperate investors at the bottom of the market in the knowledge that prices will eventually rebound.  In fact, fostering price recovery was the core, if unspoken, intent of central bank policymaking in the aftermath of the massive mortgage crisis of 2008. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan bought trillions of dollars in financial assets to boost their prices to drive down interest rates and allow markets to recover.  The problem was this “quantitative easing” (QE) policy contributed to another financial bubble and eventually to the inflation problem that has now led central banks to reverse course. With interest rates rising, investors are pulling back, in turn slowing crypto markets. This, as mentioned, is why a sudden rebound in crypto prices is harder to foresee.  Still, if we look more closely at how QE fueled the decade-long recovery from 2008, there are clues about how the crypto industry might turn things around without the central banks’ help.  ‘Storifying’ QE  The QE commitment became known as the “Bernanke Put.” Named for the then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, this was a play on put options, a form of financial derivative that gives the holder the right to sell an asset at a predetermined minimum price in order to limit future losses. The idea here was that because the Fed’s asset-buying protected investors’ downside risks, they might as well go all in and bet on gains.  Distorting markets so blatantly is rarely good policy. But for a while, it had its desired effect. What’s important is the mechanism by which that happened: The central bank made a statement (“we commit to buying bonds”) and backed it up with action (actually buying the bonds) to generate a narrative (“investors have nothing to lose because the Fed has given them a put option.”)  Crypto now needs its own compelling narrative to support a price recovery. And because there’s no central bank to put money behind it – with all due respect to FTX CEO Sam Bankman Fried’s efforts to be a lender of last resort – it needs to be a story backed by real, observable actions and outcomes.  In fact, it needs to be a better story than even the Bernanke Put, because that one was ultimately proven false. The Fed couldn’t backstop investors’ losses forever. Eventually, something had to give and that something was inflation.  Read more: Why the Fed Will Go Back to Easy Money  Also, unlike those past recovery periods, the story cannot simply be “number go up” – the pure, speculation-based play on crypto’s supposedly unstoppable upside momentum, one that’s often presented without clear fundamental logic. Central banks’ rate hikes pour cold water on that play.  No, the story must be associated with real-world utility. Now is the time to lay out valuable use cases for humanity – as we discussed last month, energy is one, but so too is crypto’s capacity to empower people living under tyranny – and to back those use cases with action, with development.  The way out of winter has always been through higher market prices.

42374098,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXbvD,1659721659,DeFi Protocol Voltz Could Bring 150% Interest Rate on Ether Deposits,"The leading smart-contract blockchain Ethereum's supposedly bullish ""Merge"" – a key milestone in its historic shift to a more environmentally friendly system – will likely happen in September.  Already, crypto traders are mapping out how they’re going to play it from an investment perspective. And blockchain protocols are racing to set up venues for lending and trading the event, and for financing speculative positions.  In one popular angle, traders buy or hold ether (ETH) in the spot or derivatives market, while buying Lido’s staked ether tokens – stETH – to profit from the event.  However, yet another option has silently emerged, whereby traders can earn a 150% annual percentage yield (APY) by taking a levered bet on an expected jump in staking yields through the Voltz protocol.  Voltz, a two-month-old automated market maker, allows users to create markets for trading any variable rate of return. Recently, it unveiled a Lido pool for stETH and a Rocket pool for rETH, another staking derivative.  Fat staking yields  Through these pools, traders can take leveraged bets on a widely predicted post-Merge doubling of annualized staking yields to 8% and higher, merely by depositing the underlying asset, ETH, as margin. Traders don’t need to hold stETH or rETH tokens to enter an interest rate swap contract, as might fit the usual practices employed in traditional money markets.  The offering might reveal a renewed appetite for risk-taking in crypto markets, still reeling from a price crash earlier this year that wiped out fortunes, collapsed “stablecoins” like Terra’s UST and led to the demise of firms including Celsius Network and Voyager Digital. The stETH tokens played a key role in the crisis.  Voltz's stETH and rETH pools went live on July 1 with a liquidity provider margin cap of $1.5 million and a promise to increase the cap over time, eventually lifting the upper limit entirely.  The protocol's website entices potential users with a button that reads ""Press for Alpha."" (Pressing that leads to a disclaimer that it's off-limits to users in ""any restricted territory,"" a list that includes the U.S.)  Backed by investors including Wintermute, Amber Funds and Bankless, Voltz describes itself as the ""first-ever synthetic interest rate swap"" protocol. According to some observers, the synthetic nature of the protocol will allow the building of more powerful and expressive financial products around yield-bearing assets.  ""Interest rate swaps will most likely be used by stablecoin farmers and treasury-management strategies,"" Alex Woodard, research associate at Arca, said.  'You need to use leverage'  Staking refers to the process of holding coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the network's operations in return for newly minted coins. “Staking annual percentage yield” refers to a rate that reflects the total amount of staking rewards a staker can expect to receive over an annual period.  ""Rates rarely increase dramatically, so if you want to trade rates you need to use leverage,” Voltz CEO and co-founder Simon Jones told CoinDesk.  The Merge will combine Ethereum's current proof-of-work blockchain with a proof-of-stake blockchain called the Beacon Chain, which has been running since 2020. The transition is considered bullish for ether, partly because it theoretically might lead to the blockchain producing less new supply of the tokens over the long term.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RPL,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/05/defi-protocol-voltz-could-bring-150-interest-rate-on-ether-deposits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/341ec0cc75f21e4a7dff5d86d7ee120a3f79c843-1593x1194.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421131,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUg1,1659720805,Why Bit Digital Is Expanding Into Canada,"Mining company Bit Digital is expanding its operations to Canada, according to Chief Strategy Officer Samir Tabar.  The New-York based company said Wednesday it had signed a two-year agreement, noting the Canadian facility would use “an energy source that is primarily hydro-power operated.” The facility powers about 650 miners and plans to host over double that amount, about 1,500 bitcoin (BTC) mining units, in the coming months.  Tabar told CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” show that the two key reasons for the move north were a bid to avoid jurisdictional risks in the U.S. while also finding ways to use “renewable sources of power.”  The company is aiming to be cautious about the energy demands associated with bitcoin mining. Tabar defended crypto’s energy use, however, saying that oftentimes bitcoin mining “uses excess energy from the grid that would otherwise be wasted.”  The mining company’s operations once stretched to China, but with financial regulators cracking down on bitcoin miners Bit Digital opted to move to the U.S., setting up shop in the New York.  However, New York lawmakers have since taken a harsh stance on bitcoin mining operations. Most recently, the state imposed a two-year moratorium on any new mining operations powered by carbon-based energy sources.  Bit Digital still has mining operations in New York, according to Tabar, who said the mining company’s relationship with lawmakers hasn’t soured.  “We’re quite happy the legislation did not throw out the baby with the bathwater,” Tabar said regarding the bill’s scope and that it does not take a “one-size fits all approach.”  Meanwhile, in the U.S. Senate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and a half-dozen other Democrats have written the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, asking for greater transparency to be applied to miners regarding carbon emissions caused by local mining operations.  Tabar said this emphasizes the “bias towards the operations of legacy institutions,” and is a bid by lawmakers to avoid cracking down on the energy demand of traditional firms. Investment banker JPMorgan Chase (JPM), for example, is among the top ranking banks that invests in fossil fuel industries.

42411419,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNeHa,1659720331,The Fake Team That Made Solana DeFi Look Huge,"CoinDesk reporters Danny Nelson and Tracy Wang on Thursday released a bombshell report that could tarnish the reputation of the entire Solana ecosystem. More than that, the dizzying tale highlights serious social vulnerabilities across blockchain and crypto development and investing.  At the center of the story is a network of 11 developers who collaborated on a complex web of decentralized finance (DeFi) services based around a Solana stablecoin exchange called Saber. The developers, with names including Surya Khosla, Larry Jarry, 0xGhostchain and Goki Rajesh, succeeded in creating trading and staking services that attracted a claimed $7.5 billion in deposits, known as “TVL” or total value locked.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Nelson and Wang have discovered, however, that those developers were not real people. Instead, they and others were aliases of just two men, the brothers Dylan and Ian Macalinao. CoinDesk’s reporters gained access to a blog post that was written by Ian Macalinao as a seeming confession to the long con. The post was never published.  That $7.5 billion in deposits made up the lion’s share of all the money tallied on Solana services in early fall of 2021, when the chain’s DeFi deposits totaled roughly $10.5 billion. TVL is often taken as a measure of success for smart-contract services or platforms, and Solana’s sizable deposits helped bolster its claim to be an up-and-coming competitor to the Ethereum blockchain.  That narrative, in turn, had a substantial role in driving the Solana token price from under $40 in July of last year to a peak of $259 in November 2021. A significant portion of the bullish Solana narrative now seems to have been based on a series of deceptions.  AnonAnonAnonymous  The developer personas weren’t all that was fake. The Macalinao brothers’ operation with Saber was seemingly undertaken with explicitly deceptive intent: “I devised a scheme to maximize Solana’s TVL: I would build protocols that stack on top of each other, such that a dollar could be counted several times,” Ian Macalinao wrote in the unpublished blog post.  Though there’s much still unknown, what may be most striking about the scheme is that it’s not clear its goal was theft. The Macalinao brothers do not appear, for instance, to have used their swarm of false identities as a shield while mishandling user funds, as is all too common in such scenarios (though, again, this story is still developing).  See also: Why CoinDesk Respects Pseudonymity | Opinion  The greater share of harm to users of the Saber ecosystem of services seems to have instead resulted from the hack of an app called Cashio seemingly created by the Macalinao brothers. Further, users have now seemingly been abandoned, with the Macalinaos announcing they’re shifting focus to new projects on the upstart Aptos blockchain.  The fault in our stats  The staggering case highlights at least two serious specific vulnerabilities in the DeFi and crypto ecosystems, and some much larger thorny questions. First, it reignites the perpetual issue of anonymous developers in the crypto space. Bitcoin founding developer Satoshi Nakamoto remains pseudonymous, and there are many good reasons blockchain devs may wish to protect their real names.  But that norm also adds to the risk of a high-speed, high-stakes environment. Even a pseudonym can be trustworthy if they’re a known entity with their own track record, but it’s clear that standard isn’t being consistently followed by DeFi speculators. As Nelson and Wang’s reporting shows, the Macalinaos were able to bolster the reputations of their various identities simply by orchestrating fake Twitter conversations and having them trade endorsements.  The second discrete issue is the use of TVL, or total value locked, as a key metric in DeFi. The Macalinao story highlights both that the metric can be technically manipulated, in this case through counting assets multiple times across services that look distinct, but aren’t. This may be fixable, as top DeFi data service DefiLlama is making changes to prevent similar attempts to game metrics.  But there’s a broader, more complex issue that is going to be much harder to tackle. What the Saber story reveals is that less than a handful of people with dishonest intentions can profoundly distort cryptocurrency markets. The Macalinao brothers’ scheme created huge false signals about the value of Solana, which is still a top-10 crypto asset at this writing.  See also: Is Solana Leading Crypto Into Retail or Trailing Apple? | Opinion  “I believe it contributed to the dramatic rise of SOL,” Ian Macalinao wrote about the token in the unpublished post. (Personally, I dipped my toes into SOL last summer, but after seeing one too many chain pauses I sold my position for a loss and no longer hold the token.)  We’ve seen even more troubling failures and deceptions in recent months from the likes of Terra/LUNA, Three Arrows Capital and centralized lenders like Celsius Network. But those were, if nothing else, genuinely sprawling operations backed up by large messaging efforts and the appearance of seriousness.  That two twentysomethings in Texas could accomplish anything remotely comparable with nothing more than a series of carefully-managed fake Twitter profiles should be an even stronger reminder of the huge risks that seem, at least for now, inherent to cryptocurrency.",NEGATIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SOL | TRADING | ZRX,David Z.

42374093,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXbqB,1659720214,Popular Election-Betting Site PredictIt Throttled by US Regulator,"Election betting platform PredictIt must shut down for U.S. users in February, according to an order from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The CFTC said the operators haven’t complied with the agency’s requirements for running the popular site.  Eight years ago, the CFTC issued a no-action letter – a document that says the regulator wouldn’t make trouble about something that might not otherwise meet existing rules – to Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, the site’s operator. PredictIt was able to take wagers from its “traders” on such open questions as the future Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election, whether the U.S. Senate will pass a reconciliation bill by Sept. 2 or whether Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) will seek the White House.  This week, the CFTC stated that the university “has not operated its market in compliance with the terms of the letter.” PredictIt was told to shutter in the U.S. by Feb. 15.  PredictIt told its U.S. users that “the security of trader funds will not be affected by this action,” and that it’ll keep going until next year. It won’t start new markets, according to a statement on PredictIt.org, and it hasn’t yet determined how it’ll resolve predictions that have an end date after February, which would include the U.S. presidential election.  The crypto industry – including Augur, PrediQt, Polymarket and FTX – has also made forays into trying to build decentralized prediction markets, with varying levels of success. Earlier this year, Polymarket was fined $1.4 million by the CFTC and ordered to close its U.S. market, though it continued with an information market for non-U.S. residents.  The university behind PredictIt was given its no-action permission on the basis that it run “a small-scale, not-for-profit, online market for event contracts in the U.S. for educational purposes.” As long as it met CFTC expectations, it didn’t have to register for oversight from the agency. The regulator didn’t specify in its statement how the no-action was violated.",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/05/popular-election-betting-site-predictit-throttled-by-us-regulator,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23c35b9d2acf503c2815591ea13beb1f81ca36d5-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There are a lot of reasons to try it out yourself - better house edges, extra bonuses, and the ability to bet with your favorite cryptocurrency and support the ecosystem. Some of the best Bitcoin casinos also offer unique games like Crash and Plinko, which you won&apos;t find elsewhere. If you&apos;re looking to get started with crypto gambling, the first step is to choose a Bitcoin wallet. But where do you go? In this article, we&apos;ll show you the three best Bitcoin wallets for gambling in 2022. First, let&apos;s get one thing straight: What Makes a Good Crypto Gambling Wallet? When it comes to gambling with Bitcoin, there are a few key factors you need to look for in a wallet. First and foremost, the wallet needs to be safe. This means that it uses strong security features to protect your coins from hackers - especially since you&apos;re likely using a hot wallet (more on those later) The second thing to look for is ease of use. The last thing you want is to struggle with sending and receiving Bitcoin when you&apos;re trying to place a bet. User-friendly wallets also mean more people can enjoy crypto betting, even if they&apos;re not blockchain wizzes. Finally, you&apos;ll want to make sure that the wallet you choose allows gambling transactions in the first place.

Wall Street is bracing for another sequential decline in the crypto exchange's trading volumes as retail demand fades further during the current cryptocurrency bear market. The company will also face concerns surrounding cost controls and a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe into certain listings.  The question at hand, though, is how much this has been priced into a stock that at its worst levels was recently down nearly 90% from an all-time high hit late last year. A near-doubling in the shares since July 1 suggests investors may be looking past the bad news to the next phase of growth.  Coinbase shares have rallied late this week despite slipping cryptocurrency prices after the company announced a partnership with BlackRock (BLK) to provide the asset management giant's institutional clients direct access to Coinbase's trading custody, prime brokerage and reporting platforms.  Volumes  Sell-side analysts expect a sizable decline in Coinbase trading volumes from the $309 million reported in the first quarter. Needham's John Todaro – who has a buy rating and $89 price target on COIN (current price is $93) – anticipates a 39% drop.  With volumes down, defending market share will be key, and Mizuho expects a big drop there as well – to 2.9% of global trading volume in July versus an average of 5.3% in the first quarter.  The decline in volumes and market share suggests Coinbase is being pressured by zero-fee trading platforms, but DA Davidson's Chris Brendler called such fears ""overblown.""  “​​It misses the significant diversity within retail, underestimating the power of simplicity,” said Brendler in a note to clients. ""Despite below-consensus expectations for Q2 and beyond, we're sticking with Coinbase as we believe the 2022 ‘crypto winter’ will ultimately work to its advantage.” He has a buy rating and $90 price target on the stock.

42421128,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUcv,1659713507,"Crypto’s Future Depends on Security, Ledger Exec Says","Crypto exchanges and other intermediaries such as cross-chain bridges are where the latest series of crypto hacks on internet-based “hot” wallets have been taking place. Exchanges need to put in additional security measures, said Alex Zinder, global head of hardware wallet maker Ledger Enterprises.  Zinder said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” show that the crypto ecosystem’s rapid growth has increased the threat of hacks and exploits, creating safety issues “that are very difficult to manage.”  “The way we look at this problem set is security at the edges,” said Zinder. “The challenge is, as you build additional complexity into the ecosystem you have more intermediaries and different players.”  Zinder’s spoke days after the latest hack to sweep the crypto ecosystem. On Tuesday more than 8,000 Solana blockchain hot wallets were compromised, draining at least $5 million worth of Solana-based tokens from unsuspecting users.  The exploit has “renewed a focus on security,” which could be a “symptom of crypto’s own success,” he said. However, Zinder said, the Solana blockchain is not the problem.  “It’s the intermediaries, it’s the wallet providers,” he said.  Unlike the hot wallets that are always connected to the internet, Zinder’s company, Ledger, provides “cold,” or external wallets, that are not connected to the internet but stores crypto key information on hardware, such as a USB-like external device.  The crypto industry’s growth could be based on partnerships between exchanges and hardware wallet providers, he said.  “Security is really the precursor to mass adoption and scalability,” he said.  The France-based wallet maker, now valued at $1.5 billion, raised $380 million in a Series C funding round in June 2021.  While Zinder did not comment on whether his company has secured the $100 million in funding it seeks, he said Ledger has sold more than 5 million hardware wallets that hold crypto, or about 15% of the world’s crypto asset holdings.  In addition, Zinder is bullish on the use of non-fungible tokens (NFT). Here, too, he sees the need for security, especially for major corporations using NFTs to push their brands.  “If you do that incorrectly, if you compromise on security or you compromise on governance, you're putting that audience, community and your brand at risk fundamentally,” he said.

The Indian agency is investigating several fintech companies over alleged fraud on instant loan apps, which are apps that make short-term loans.  WazirX ""actively assisted around 16 accused fintech companies in laundering the proceeds of crime using the crypto route,"" the ED said in a press release. As a result, the government has frozen $8.1 million in funds held by WazirX.  Mhatre hasn't cooperated with authorities, the ED said, noting that he failed to disclose details of a transaction in March that involved the purchase of cryptocurrencies with proceeds that were gained from alleged fraud on instant loan apps.  According to the ED, various fintech companies backed by Chinese funds were unable to get authorization from India's central bank and therefore turned to the crypto route.  On Tuesday, India's Ministry of Finance announced that it was investigating two cases against WazirX under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), with allegations that WazirX used the Binance crypto exchange to disguise transactions.  “It has been found that all crypto transactions between these two exchanges were not even being recorded on the blockchains and were thus cloaked in mystery,"" the ministry added, according to business news site Moneycontrol.  One of the cases dates back to 2021, when the ED first issued a FEMA notice over cryptocurrency transactions worth $382 million.  WazirX didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Market Moves: Omkar Godbole reports on Flow token's price rally of 40% and how the surge is related to Meta Platform's decision to use the blockchain to expand its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) initiative.  Chart of The Day: Bitcoin's put-call skew continues to drift lower, indicating a weakening of bearish sentiment.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Gains early Friday in bitcoin (BTC) appeared to reverse after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added 528,000 jobs in July, double the number economists had forecast.  The report may mean the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in its efforts to tamp down inflation, which is at a four-decade high. Hawkish moves by the central bank tend to depress prices of risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.  The jobs report came at the end of a slow week in crypto that nevertheless brought signs of growing institutional adoption. Asset manager Brevan Howard pulled off the largest crypto hedge fund launch ever, with more than $1 billion in assets under management, and BlackRock formed a partnership with crypto exchange Coinbase to make crypto directly available to institutional investors. Coinbase's shares closed 10% higher on Thursday after jumping almost 40% intraday.  Derivatives giant Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced on Thursday that it will roll out bitcoin euro and ether euro futures contracts on Aug. 29, pending regulatory approval.  Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, appeared to be fairly unaffected by the positive news this week. It has been trading in a range of $22,900 to $24,500 over the last seven days and lost 3% during that period.  Ether (ETH) was down 3.4% on the week, amid concerns over the Ethereum network’s upcoming Merge. The Merge is set to take place in September. The planned shift to a proof-of-stake network will have a number of consequences, Citigroup said in a research report Thursday, including lower energy intensity, the transition of ether into a deflationary asset and a “potential road map to a more scalable future through sharding.""  Altcoins had a positive week with Filecoin taking the lead with a 40% gain. Fantom’s FTM was up 14%, and near, the token of the Near platform, jumped 11%.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Loopring LRC +4.4% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK +4.3% Computing Avalanche AVAX +3.5% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −1.9% Smart Contract Platform  Market Moves  Meta's NFT Outreach Powers 38% Rally in FLOW Token  By Omkar Godbole  The token of the Flow blockchain surged over 35% in the wake of Facebook parent Meta Platform's decision to use the blockchain to expand its NFT initiative.  CoinDesk data shows FLOW rose 38% to $2.62 in the past 24 hours and went as high as $2.84, which was its highest price since May 31.  The token surged after Meta announced the international expansion of its recently tested digital collectibles feature on its photo and video-sharing platform Instagram and declared support for NFTs created on the Flow blockchain.  Meta also announced support for Coinbase wallet and Dapper wallet as third-party wallets compatible for use as part of its expansion plan.  The Flow blockchain was created by Dapper Labs and is best known for a NFT hit NBA Top Shot. In May, Dapper Labs unveiled a $725 million fund to boost “gaming, infrastructure, decentralized finance, content and creators” in the Flow ecosystem.  The Flow token's price rally is backed by a triple-digit jump in futures open interest across major exchanges, including Binance, according to data tracked by Coinglass. Open interest refers to the number of contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position.  An increase in open interest means more money is being deployed in the FLOW market and validates the price rally.  FLOW has topped its 100-day simple moving average (SMA), leaving both bitcoin and ether behind, which continue to trade below the key SMA. The bigger downtrend, however, is still intact as seen in the chart below.  Chart of the Day: Bitcoin's Put-Call Skew Continues to Drift Lower  By Omkar Godbole  The 90-day put-call skew, which measures the difference between prices paid for puts relative to calls, continues to decline, indicating a weakening of bearish sentiment.  According to data tracked by crypto analytics platform Genesis Volatility, call options or bullish bets have been in demand this week.  ""Both short-dated and long dated BTC calls bought outright with relatively cheap volatility,"" Genesis Volatility said in a market update published Thursday.

42374097,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXbsh,1659708777,Core Scientific Sold More Bitcoin in July Than It Mined,"Core Scientific (CORZ), one of the world's largest bitcoin miners by hashrate, which is a measure of computing power, said it produced 1,221 bitcoins in July while selling 1,975 to pay for capital and growth expenses.  The miner received a total of $44 million, or $22,000 each, according to a statement published Friday. Core Scientific used the cash from the sale for capital investments related to increasing its data center capacity and to pay mining rig manufacturer Bitmain for the 100,000 mining rigs that it ordered in 2021.  Core Scientific said it has less than $10 million in payments remaining for the rigs, excluding shipping and customs charges. The company still holds 1,205 bitcoins, and it has about $83 million in cash on its balance sheet.  “During the month of July, we continued to enhance liquidity, strengthen our balance sheet, streamline our organization and make further progress toward achieving our 2022 operating objectives,” CEO Mike Levitt said in the statement.  The sale comes after the miner offloaded 7,202 bitcoins in June to raise about $167 million. The company is not alone as bitcoin miners have started to sell their mined digital assets this year to pay for expenses during the bear market. Most recently, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) said it sold 275 bitcoins in July for $5.6 million.  Core Scientific expects to continue selling self-mined bitcoin to pay operating expenses, fund growth, retire debt and maintain liquidity.  The miner said it has about 195,000 mining rigs with a total hashrate of about 19.3 exahash per second (EH/s), which it says is the largest mining capacity of “any listed company in North America.” Core Scientific's operation is a blend of self-mining and hosting for other miners.

42374099,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXbrR,1659704911,Justin Sun Backs Ethereum Hard Fork as Merge Approaches,"Tron founder Justin Sun has emerged as one of the most prominent investors supporting a hard fork of Ethereum after the blockchain switches to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, an event known as The Merge, that's expected in September.  Developers say the move away from a proof-of-work (PoW) system will make the network much cheaper, faster and environmentally friendly. It will also mean the end of an income stream for Ethereum miners, who are rewarded with ether (ETH) tokens for supplying resources to the blockchain. Miners produced over $620 million worth of ether in July alone, data show, making The Merge akin to a death knell for a significant chunk of cash.  That has prompted some prominent Chinese miners to propose a hard fork, so even as Ethereum undergoes The Merge and becomes validated by stakers, the miners will continue to support a newly separated PoW version of the chain – a move that could theoretically keep their financial activity intact.  “We currently have more than 1 million ETH,” Sun said in a Thursday tweet. “If Ethereum hard fork succeeds, we will donate some forked #ETHW to #ETHW community and developers to build Ethereum ecosystem.  Sun-backed crypto exchange Poloniex has offered support for the Ethereum fork, currently called EthereumPOW. The exchange will list both ether and the forked token, currently termed ETHW. A futures product for the new token will be launched in August, allowing investors to bet on prices.  Tron-based stablecoin USDD, in which Sun has invested billions of dollars, will become the “first stablecoin in the EthereumPOW ecosystem,” according to a tweet.  Neither Tron nor Sun responded to requests for additional comments.  Another key proponent of the hard fork is China-based miner Chandler Guo, who was said to have previously played a part in forking Ethereum in 2016 to continue the existing chain as Ethereum Classic. Guo did not shy away from touching on that fact in a tweet earlier this week: “I fork ethereum once, I will fork it again”  A Twitter account by backers of EthereumPOW set up a donation address earlier this week for community members to fund development.  The address has received a $1,400 worth of ether so far and $400 in the tether, suggesting the community may not share the same enthusiasm for EthereumPOW as Sun and Guo.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETC | EXCHANGE | FORKS,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/05/justin-sun-backs-ethereum-hard-fork-as-merge-approaches,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5975c5cc373102007bdcd5e23efaa5d04db3009-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price of bitcoin (BTC) immediately fell on concerns the U.S. Federal Reserve will view the data as a green light to continue its series of rate hikes.  U.S. employers added 528,000 jobs, a report by the Labor Department on Friday showed, up from 372,000 jobs in June, the fastest growth in five months. The figure exceeded the average of economists’ estimates, 250,000 jobs, according to a FactSet survey.  The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% from 3.6%.  The price of bitcoin fell modestly following the report, but remains higher by 2% over the last 24 hours at $23,100. U.S. stock index futures fell 1% on the news as the strong figures seem to point to continued aggressive tightening by the U.S. central bank.  As a result of the much stronger-than-expected report, traders are now pricing in a 65% chance that the Fed will hike rates by 75 basis points in September, as shown by the CME FedWatch Tool. That is up from 34% just one day ago.  Some economists had hoped for a reduction in the pace of hiring because it could suggest a general slowdown in the economy, which is exactly what U.S. central bankers are trying to achieve by raising interest rates aggressively. However, an additional 528,000 jobs added suggests that the labor market is still very strong, giving the Federal Reserve more room for rate hikes.  Global markets, including cryptocurrencies, recently ticked higher after comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggesting the Fed would probably slow monetary tightening for the rest of the year as the economy adjusts to the higher borrowing costs. Bitcoin jumped 8% that day and has since been trading in the $22,600 to $24,500 range, with some traditional traders already pricing in rate cuts for 2023.  But the Fed is far from done. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Wednesday the central bank expects another 1.5 percentage point increase in interest rates by the end of the year, which would bring the federal funds rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%.  “I think we’ll probably have to be higher for longer in order to get the evidence that we need to see that inflation is actually turning around on all dimensions and in a convincing way coming lower, not just a tick lower here and there,” Bullard said during an interview on CNBC.  Inflation is still running at 9.1%, the highest in 40 years, with new economic data on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) coming out next Wednesday expected to show a reprieve.  One factor that could contribute to long-term high inflation going forward is high wage growth.  ""It may take some time and a lot of rate hikes to slow core inflation down,” said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. “The Fed will note the rise in average hourly wage growth.”  In July, hourly wage growth continued to climb at a rapid pace of 5.2%, up 0.5% from the previous month. That is still significantly lower than the current inflation rate, an indication that workers are falling behind relative to the rising cost of living.  However, in order for inflation to subside, wage growth has to decrease.  “The rate of growth of wages is not consistent with 2% inflation over time,” Powell said during a hearing in front of Congress in June. “It’s great when wages go up, and we want them to go up, we want people to get strong wage increases. But at a certain point, wages become high enough that companies start raising prices and you wind up getting high inflation.”  UPDATE (Aug. 5. 2022 13:34 UTC): Adds quote from Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.

42374085,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXbdb,1659696695,Citi: Ethereum’s Merge Will Have Several Consequences for the Blockchain,"The Ethereum blockchain’s planned Merge, an upgrade that changes it from a proof-of-work (PoW) system to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, will have a number of consequences, Citigroup said in a research report Thursday.  These include lower energy intensity, the transition into a deflationary asset and a “potential road map to a more scalable future through sharding,” the bank said.  The Merge, the first of five planned upgrades for the network, may increase transaction speeds by only 10% by reducing block times, according to the report. The upgrade, however, lays the path for the “Surge,” which is the next planned upgrade for the network and promises to bring 100,000 transactions-per-second (TPS) capability to the blockchain, the report added.  The Merge means that block time will drop to 12 seconds from 13, and that could result in a small decrease in fees and an increase in speed, the note said.  Citi says switching from PoW will reduce overall issuance of ether by 4.2% a year, and with ether (ETH) eventually becoming deflationary, this may improve the case for the token as a store of value.  The move to PoS turns ETH into a “yield-bearing asset” with cash flows, the bank said, which may be interpreted as a form of revenue for the network. Having potential cash flows would allow the use of a range of valuation methods that aren't available for the blockchain now, the bank added.  Because Ethereum will be both yield-bearing and deflationary, it is less likely to be the blockchain with the highest throughput. Given its “enhanced store-of-value properties,” it is more likely to be where a growing amount of total value locked is secured and transacted, the note said.  Post-Merge ETH could be viewed as a relatively energy-efficient and environmentally friendly crypto asset, as energy expenditure is expected to decrease by 99.95%, the note added.

42374095,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXbov,1659693395,"Almost 7% of People in Spain Have Invested in Crypto, Regulator Says","As much as 6.8% of the people in Spain have invested in crypto at some point, driven mainly by the hope of profit and faith in the underlying technology, according to a survey by the country’s securities markets regulator.  The CNMV's study follows a crackdown on crypto ads announced in January in response to concerns that influencers such as FC Barcelona soccer star Andrés Iniesta could tempt people into taking undue risks.  While nine in 10 of those interviewed recalled seeing information about the risks of investing in crypto, the regulator nevertheless appears to be worried by an overall lack of awareness about the sector.  Even though the European Union has struck a deal to establish new licensing rules for virtual assets across the bloc, that won’t take effect for a couple of years. In the meantime, crypto companies can register in Spain to comply with money-laundering norms, as Moon Tech Spain, a unit of the Binance crypto exchange, did in July.  “It is striking that 40% [of crypto investors] consider cryptocurrencies to be regulated by law, and that 29% think they have the same risks as other investments,” according to a summary of findings published by the regulator on Thursday.  Over half the population think the warnings on crypto ads are easy to read and large enough, the study found.  The study, carried out with survey company Análisis e Investigación, involved 1,500 adults and took place in May and June.

42374088,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXbhN,1659688644,"Crypto Miner Argo Blockchain Faced Equipment Challenges, Higher Costs in July","Crypto miner Argo Blockchain (ARB) mined 219 bitcoins (BTC) or bitcoin equivalents in July, 22% more than in June, even as it combated equipment problems and higher electricity costs.  Power costs at its Helios facility in Texas were greater than expected, partly because of higher natural gas prices and partly because increased demand for air-conditioning during the unusually hot summer has driven up electricity prices.  While Texas and other U.S. states are generally friendly toward mining firms, the relationships could become strained should their presence put a burden on the electricity supply during periods of heightened demand.  Several mining firms halted operations in the state last month to minimize the threat of power outages that would affect people's homes. Riot Blockchain pocketed $9.5 million in power credits as a result of curtailing its output.  Argo, which is based in London, also had failures among its S17 and T17 miners, which it said reflects wider mining industry experience. Argo found that a large number of its 17 series machines are not operational or suitable for repair. With the removal of those machines, Argo's hashrate in July stood at 2.23 exahashes per second, largely unchanged from its 2.22EH/s in June as new S19J Pros were installed. Hashrate is a measure of computing power.  During the month, Argo raised around $20 million from the sale of 887 BTC and used some of the proceeds to pay back some of its loan from Galaxy Digital for the purchase of the Helios facility. The loan balance outstanding stood at $6.72 million at the end of July.  Shares of Argos, traded on the London Stock Exchange, fell about 3% as of 8:22 UTC. They have fallen around 55% this year following the trend of bitcoin's price.

However, it also reiterated its stance that it doesn't have plans to issue a retail digital currency.  Vachira Arromdee, a deputy governor at the bank, noted in the release that central banks around the world were seeing ""the potential of retail CBDC as being the foundation of the future financial system.""  The latest pilot program would be in addition to previous wholesale CBDC projects and the proof-of-concept study for a retail CBDC that were conducted with help from private companies.  The pilot phase will test real-life application of a retail CBDC and will be conducted with the support of the private sector. This will help the Bank of Thailand form related policies and improve the CBDC design, the announcement said.

A study titled &apos;Revisiting Bitcoin&apos;s Carbon Footprint&apos; showed how Bitcoin could be responsible for 65.4 megatons of carbon emissions annually, which is about the same amount as the entire country of Greece. China&apos;s crackdown on Bitcoin mining hasn&apos;t entirely made the dent in these numbers it was expected to, mainly since it was later found that mining in China never stopped. Simply put, no amount of restriction will make a difference. Bitcoin was created to resist regulation and censorship, so even if a country banned mining, it wouldn&apos;t stop individuals from building mining rigs in their homes. High energy consumption The high energy consumption of the mining process is not a flaw; it&apos;s a feature. Bitcoin mining is the process of validating token transactions without the intervention of third parties. This validation process uses large amounts of energy, using the computational power of thousands of mining machines. This entire process used to be possible with home computers, but mining hardware has evolved since the early 2000s, giving rise to Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, chips solely made for mining Bitcoin. These machines constantly run, causing vast amounts of consumption close to the energy used by countries like the Netherlands or Chile.

The bullish turnaround in the 50-day SMA with the 100-day SMA breakout teases a crossover. With a market cap of $2.24 billion, the intraday trading volume of VeChain has dropped by 24% to reach $141 million. Past Performance of VET The bullish reversal with a Morning Star pattern in the VET prices starts after the FED&apos;s interest rates hike. Currently, the inflation rate of the last two weeks stands at 33% resulting in the $0.028 level breakout. However, the declining trend in the trading volume weakens the possibility of an uptrend continuation.

Hence, if the buying pressure sustains, we can see a trend continuation to $0.033. The bull run above the 100-day SMA increases the bullish influence over the 50-day SMA resulting in a positive turnaround. Hence, the possibility of a bullish crossover increases.

CNN first reported the extradition.  A few weeks ago, U.S. authorities had called off their request to extradite the Russian national from France. However, by calling off the extradition request Vinnik could be sent to Greece and later to the U.S, his lawyer had said at the time.  At the time, Belot declined to explain the legal mechanism being used by U.S. authorities, only responding that ""by withdrawing their request, the U.S. reactivated the Greece request.""  In 2020, Vinnik was indicted by a California court on allegations of “computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials and narcotics distribution rings.”  Vinnik is known as an operator of BTC-e, one of the earliest bitcoin (BTC) exchanges, which was linked to the hack of Mt. Gox, the first bitcoin exchange, which never recovered after a theft of 744,408 BTC and had to shut down in 2014.  Vinnik has always denied that he ran BTC-e, claiming he only worked at the exchange.  BTC-e, in turn, was shut down by U.S. authorities in 2017, its servers confiscated and Vinnik arrested in Greece, where he was on a beach with his family. Since then three countries have been competing to extradite Vinnik – the U.S., France and Russia – with all three presenting a different set of allegations.  France prevailed in 2020, and Vinnik was sentenced to five years in prison by a French court. The sentence was upheld last summer.

CoinDesk data shows FLOW rose 38% to $2.62 in the past 24 hours. Prices hit a high of $2.84 at point, the highest since May 31.  The token ran into buying pressure after Meta announced the international expansion of its recently piloted digital collectibles feature on its photo and video-sharing platform Instagram. Meta declared support for NFTs created on the Flow blockchain. NFTs are digital tokens that represent ownership of physical or virtual assets.  The social media giant also announced support for Coinbase (COIN) wallet and Dapper wallet as third-party wallets compatible for use as part of its expansion plan.  The Flow blockchain was created by Dapper Labs and is best known for the NFT hit NBA Top Shot. In May, Dapper Labs unveiled a $725 million fund to boost “gaming, infrastructure, decentralized finance, content and creators” in the Flow ecosystem.  FLOW's price rally is backed by a triple-digit jump in futures open interest across major exchanges, including Binance, according to data tracked by Coinglass. Open interest refers to the number of contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position.  An increase in open interest means more money is being deployed in the FLOW market and validates the price rally.
