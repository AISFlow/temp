Based on his analysis, the flagship crypto might not yet be ready for its next leg up, which could see it climb back above $70,000. Bitcoin Not Yet Ready To Establish $65,000 As New Support Rekt Capital claimed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin is not quite ready just yet for a successful retest of the $65,000 level as new support. For the crypto to establish $65,000 as the new support level, the analyst stated that it would need a similar restest like the one which happened sometime in May earlier this year. According to Rekt Capital, this will confirm a break back into the $65,000 to $71,500 region. Related Reading: PEPE Explosion Imminent: Analyst Predicts Price Will Rocket To $0.00004128 ATH Bitcoin establishing $65,000 is crucial as that will also confirm that the downtrend is over as the flagship crypto still risks dropping to the $60,000 range while still below $65,000. Meanwhile, as Rekt Capital noted, Bitcoin holding above the $65,000 support would mean that it is ready to revisit its previous top above $70,000. Bitcoin rising above $70,000 and reaching as high as $71,500 will inspire confidence among investors that the bull run is well underway again. Crypto expert Michael van de Poppe had before now highlighted the $70,000 range as the level for Bitcoin to beat in order to surpass its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa also recently highlighted three scenarios that could play out for Bitcoin from its current price level. He claimed that the flagship crypto could dump to $63,000 and “return the pump,” dump to $60,000, and return the pump or dump to $60,000 while enjoying some relief bounces and then “die” after it dumps to $60,000. However, the analyst is most hopeful that Bitcoin just break above this level without any pullback and rise to $70,000. What To Expect From BTC Heading Into The Latter Parts Of The Cycle Crypto analyst Dann Crypto shared his expectations for Bitcoin heading into the latter parts of this bull run. He claimed that Bitcoin will enjoy a run-up heading into the US Presidential elections due to the easy narrative of a potential crypto President and Vice President. He expects this rally to also happen thanks to a potential first-rate cut and just the “overall excitement” after Bitcoin had ranged for about four months. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 450% Move For Shiba Inu To Reach New All-Time High Daan Crypto also alluded to the Spot Ethereum ETFs, describing them as a “bit of a wildcard” since they could “accelerate the rally,” but it all depends on how much demand these ETFs enjoy. Once this Bitcoin rally is done, Daan Crypto expects that the market will experience another local top with this likely to happen during the new year. The crypto analyst predicts that the final rally in this bull run will come in the latter half of 2025, as part of the 4-year cycle. Daan Crypto noted that this 4-year cycle has always worked and that there is no reason why it shouldn’t work this time around. He warned market participants to not get fixated on a particular target as the market top for Bitcoin and instead, advised them to be fluid.

31180026,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630463,1721338245,NEAR Surges 20%: Pantera Capital MP Reveals 5 Reasons For Bullish Outlook,"NEAR, the native token of the Layer 1 (L1) blockchain Near Protocol, has surged to a one-month high after breaking out of a previous downtrend that saw the token hit a low of $4 on July 5. Currently trading at $5.93, NEAR has recorded a substantial 20% gain over the past week, propelling it to the 19th position among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. This positive momentum has drawn the attention of venture capital firm Pantera Capital, whose Managing Partner, Paul Veradittakit, has shared several reasons for the firm’s bullish stance on NEAR’s protocol and its growth potential. Scalability Solution Amidst Bitcoin And Ethereum Challenges Veradittakit took to social media on Thursday to highlight NEAR’s value proposition within the blockchain ecosystem. Veradittakit noted that while Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have been at the forefront of the crypto technology “revolution,” with Bitcoin establishing itself as a store of value and Ethereum supporting smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), both face “challenges” related to transaction scalability. According to Pantera’s MP, this is where NEAR Protocol plays a key role in addressing these scalability issues while prioritizing developer engagement and user experience by offering a scalable and user-centric blockchain solution. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $1.03 Soon, Warns Of Initial Dip NEAR distinguishes itself with its Thresholded Proof of Stake (TPoS) system and Nightshade sharding, which increases scalability and decentralization. These advancements have paved the way for NEAR to achieve significant milestones, such as reaching $335 million in Total Value Locked (TVL), an increase of 547% in just six months. According to Veradittakit, such growth demonstrates NEAR’s traction and strategic effectiveness in the market. Furthermore, NEAR’s market presence is fortified by key metrics, including a 42% quarter-on-quarter increase in daily active addresses, a surge in transactions from 35 million to over 220 million, and a substantial rise in monthly active users from 2.9 million to 15 million. NEAR And Crypto AI Integration Notably, NEAR is also positioning itself as a leader in the emerging crypto artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, which has gained significant traction especially over the past year with surges of firms like Nvidia. The NEAR team has emphasized the integration of AI through an open and decentralized framework, which places user control over data and assets at the forefront. This has garnered recognition, as NEAR has been announced as part of Grayscale’s AI Fund. The fund’s component assets and weightings include Bittensor at 2.92%, Filecoin at 30.59%, Livepeer at 8.64%, NEAR at 32.99%, and Render at 24.86%. Related Reading: THORChain (RUNE) Primed For Big Gains, Analyst Eyes $20 Milestone Lastly, Veradittakit emphasized that NEAR’s success can be attributed to the leadership of its co-founders, Illia Polosukhin and Alexander Skidanov, as Polosukhin’s expertise in AI and Skidanov’s engineering understanding has been “instrumental” in developing NEAR’s infrastructure. Despite reaching its monthly high of $5.93 and a substantial 300% gain year-to-date, the token will need to break above the $8.28 level in the short term to break out of its downtrend structure. However, with these advancements and the adoption of AI-related tokens, NEAR may be poised for further gains throughout the year, helped along by the broader market’s recovery.

Still, his tirades this week after an assassin's bullet grazed Donald Trump stood out, even for Selkis. And colleagues at Messari, which has financial backing from major firms such as Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital and hedge-fund titan Brevan Howard and wasreportedly once valued at $300 million, apparently asked him to cool it.  ""Just had a terrific 'tough love' session with Messari leadership, and I can't tell you how much I appreciate people who approach me in good faith and help rein me in because they know my vision and where my heart is,"" he posted Thursday. ""I ran too hot this week, and will address that in full soon.""  So what's this about? It might have something to do with how worked up he got on X after the attempt on Trump's life. (As of Thursday, he'd made his tweets private. They remain visible to his 354,000 or so followers.)  ""Anyone that votes against Trump at this point can die in a f*cking fire,"" he posted on X the afternoon of the shooting. ""Literal war."" (This post has since been deleted.) He added in another tweet: ""The Civil War for the country started today, and if you are anti-Trump you are against the men who are willing to fight. Good luck.""  The next day, violence, at least in self-defense, was on his mind. ""Bolshevism cannot be cured with votes. We must excise the metastatic cancer and evil of the left, by force if necessary. This is why the Second Amendment was and is so important. Do not initiate violence, but if it's brought to your door, finish with violence.""  War still was, too. ""Unfortunately, unity can sometimes only be achieved after a decisive victory. This is one of those moments. The previous three were in 1776, 1860, and 1942. Praying for peace. Preparing for war.""  Selkis echoed the MAGA movement's anti-immigration rhetoric. He asked an X user if they were ""a citizen or just a green card holder?"" The person replied that they are a green card holder about to apply for citizenship. Selkis' response: ""I hope we send you back. ... You are not entitled to citizenship. I hope it stays that way.""  Selkis posted pictures of a bloodied Trump right after he was injured. Beneath them was the famous photo of then-President Barack Obama and current President Joe Biden in a conference room as Osama bin Laden was killed by Seal Team 6. Selkis wrote, ""Too true.""  He addressed another post to a prominent Washington crypto critic, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), posting side-by-side photos of her and Trump's would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks. ""Are you happy that Trump is still alive? Or disappointed to have missed your shot in taking out a 'dictator who will destroy democracy.' Physiognomy doesn't lie ...""  Use of the term physiognomy, a long-discredited practice of discerning someone's character from how they look, was an apparent attempt to imply a physical resemblance between the bespectacled duo.  He replied to a tweet from SEC Chair Gensler: ""We're so close to your inevitable jail sentence, I can almost taste it.""  Selkis, when contacted by a CoinDesk journalist, declined to elaborate on his posts the past week.  This is not the sort of online behavior one normally associates with a CEO, particularly one with serious venture capital backing – though brashness is not uncommon among crypto users of social media (and X's owner, Elon Musk, is known to push the envelope, too).  Messari, a platform that lets users monitor and examine data about digital assets, plays an important role in crypto. Selkis has emerged as a key part of the industry's attempt to regain influence in Washington following the disappearance of Sam Bankman-Fried's massive clout there.  Selkis spoke to the crowd, standing beside Trump, earlier this year at the former president's NFT gala at Mar-a-Lago.  Read more: Ryan Selkis Goes to Washington  After his initial ""tough love"" tweet on Thursday, Selkis tweeted further. He wasn't much quieter.  ""I sent tweets aggressively screaming from the rooftops about self-defense and taking the current political situation more seriously than the media does. You've been warned. I wish haters spent the same effort protecting kids, preventing war, and defending American values,"" he said.  Also: ""Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.

The 25 million euro ($27.22 million) bond with a four-month maturity was issued by CDP on the Ethereum-based Polygon {{MATIC}} network, with Intesa Sanpaolo being the underwriter and sole investor, according to a press release. The cash flow was settled in euros on the same day (T+0) using the Bank of Italy's ""TIPS Hash Link"" tool that allows interoperability between blockchains and traditional payment rails.  The transaction was the first digital bond issuance under the country's so-called ""FinTech"" decree-law, which governs the issuance and circulation of digital versions of certain financial instruments, the banks said.  The issuance was part of the European Central Bank's (ECB) initiative to trial ways for wholesale fiat money settlement on blockchains.  Global banks and asset managers are increasingly exploring ways to put traditional financial instruments such as bonds, credit and funds on blockchains, also known as tokenization of real-world assets.

Even as the broader crypto community expects buyers to step in and push prices higher, there are exciting developments that buttress this outlook. Billions Worth Of BTC Pulled From Exchanges According to exchange data shared by one analyst on X, BTC holders increasingly pull their coins from exchanges. On July 5, when prices tanked, pushing the world’s most valuable coin close to $50,000, a staggering $3.8 billion BTC was moved from exchanges. Once this happened, prices rapidly bounced back, rising from as low as $53,500 to $65,000 recorded earlier this week. Though prices have been moving horizontally above $62,500 recently, more BTC is being withdrawn. On July 16, BTC owners pulled another $3.4 billion of the coin. Related Reading: Why Did The German Government Sell Off 50,000 Bitcoin In 2 Weeks Even though there is no clear impact on prices, if past performance guides, it is likely that prices will edge higher like they did after the collapse to $53,500. Usually, analysts interpret exchange outflows as positive for price. Whenever coin holders move assets to non-custodial wallets, they want to take control of their coins. As such, they might be unwilling to sell. Their decision helps support prices since they won’t sell on demand if they wish to, like if they held them on crypto platforms like Binance or Coinbase. Moreover, with fewer BTC readily available on exchanges, bulls tend to benefit due to increased scarcity. Is Bitcoin Preparing For Another Leg Up Above $72,000? Beyond this development, another analyst notes that the Realized Profit and Loss Ratio metric has fallen and stands at multi-month lows. The metric is used to gauge market sentiment, mainly influenced by profit and loss at any point in time. This decrease suggests that investors who wanted to exit at highs have already taken profit. For now, traders must wait for these metrics to rise, perhaps to multi-month highs, ideally above $72,000 and $74,000, before profit-taking resumes. Related Reading: XRP Price Plummets To $0.5724, Can Bulls Maintain Support? Bitcoin has also reclaimed its average cost basis of short-term holders (STHs) as prices recover above $62,000. Those who bought within the last 155 days are now in the money. They are likely holding and expecting more gains in the coming sessions before realizing profits.

The incident led to the temporary suspension of withdrawals as the exchange worked to investigate and mitigate the breach. In a subsequent report released by WazirX, preliminary findings shed light on the causes of the exploit. At the same time, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic suggested the potential involvement of North Korea in this sophisticated attack. WazirX Multisig Wallet Breach WazirX disclosed that the cyber attack targeted one of their multisig wallets, which utilized the services of Liminal’s digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure since February 2023. The wallet allegedly had a configuration involving six signatories, including five from the WazirX team and one from Liminal, who were responsible for transaction verifications. Three WazirX signatories, who employed Ledger Hardware Wallets for added security, were required to approve a transaction, followed by the final approval from Liminal’s signatory. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $1.03 Soon, Warns Of Initial Dip Additionally, a whitelisting policy was in place to “enhance security,” allowing transactions solely to predefined addresses facilitated by Liminal. The exchange further disclosed that the breach originated from a “discrepancy” between the data displayed on Liminal’s interface and the actual contents of the transaction. During the attack, the exchange notes a “mismatch” between the information displayed on Liminal’s interface and what was signed. It is suspected that the payload was manipulated to transfer wallet control to the attacker, enabling them to exploit the vulnerability. North Korean Affiliation In $235M Breach? WazirX emphasized its implementation of “robust” security measures, including the Gnosis Safe multi-sig smart contract platform and Liminal’s whitelisting policy. Despite these precautions, the cyber attackers managed to breach the security features and execute the theft. Looking ahead, the exchange expressed its commitment to protecting customer assets and acknowledged the need for further investigation and reinforcement of security protocols. The exchange concluded by stating the following: This is a force majeure event beyond our control, but we are leaving no stone unturned to locate and recover the funds. We have already blocked a few deposits and reached out to concerned wallets for recovery. We are in touch with the best resources to help us in this endeavor. While these are our findings from our preliminary investigation, we will keep you posted with further updates. Together with your support, we shall overcome this challenge and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever.

42407837,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6CtE,1721330259,Bitcoin Mining Is So Back (Except It's AI Now),"Bitcoin is up 7% over the last five days. You know what that means? Bitcoin mining is so back (until bitcoin’s price falls 5% over a five-day stretch again, after which it’ll be so over again).  With bitcoin’s price surge, the stock prices of four of the five largest publicly traded miners (measured by total hashrate, or computing power spent securing the Bitcoin network) are up double-digit percentage points.  The one laggard, Iris Energy Ltd (IREN), the fifth largest in this quintet, is down 15% following a report published last week by Culper Research in which the firm disclosed a short position in IREN. The reason Culper's taking a bearish bet: the unsuitability, in the researchers' view, of Iris’ Childress, Texas site for artificial intelligence (AI) or high-performance computing (HPC).  AI and HPC might seem unrelated to bitcoin mining, but such diversification has become a way for bitcoin miners to make money, as evidenced by Core Scientific’s (CORZ) 200 megawatt (MW) AI deal with CoreWeave last month, which pumped CORZ’s share price by 40%.  (Perhaps if the price of bitcoin continues its upward creep, the unsuitability of IREN’s sites for non-bitcoin mining revenue-generating activities can fall to the wayside as the company shifts resources back to bitcoin mining.)  In any event, what “bitcoin mining is so back” really means is “bitcoin mining stocks are back,” because on a pure “are there more miners now?” basis, known pool hashrate has only increased slightly over the last five days (from 663.618 exahashes per second to 668.659 Eh/s) rather than increase by 7% as one might expect. (Note: there is no “perfect” data point for hashrate.) Of course, hashrate not reacting immediately and proportionally to a bitcoin price increase is good for the public companies.  But then if you look into the narrative around bitcoin mining and check out what the mining companies are saying, in interviews or public filings, you find that, while they’re still focused on bitcoin mining, there’s much ado about other seemingly unrelated or tangentially related things.  AI, or High-Performance Computing  Here’s a splashy headline: Private Equity Giants Are Circling Bitcoin Miners on AI Allure  And another: Core Scientific Upgraded to Buy From Neutral to Reflect HPC Expansion: B Riley  And one more, as good things come in threes: Bitcoin Mining Sector Is Attracting Growing Investor Interest Following Core Scientific Deal: JPMorgan  Last week, I wrote about how both AI and Bitcoin use a lot of energy and, not only that, it seems that it is straightforward for Bitcoin mining facilities to be retrofitted for the next hot thing: AI (or HPC, if you want to avoid the backlash against AI hype).  Investors like this adaptability. From CoinDesk’s Will Canny and Aoyon Ashraf, “Private equity (PE) firms are finally seeing value in bitcoin (BTC) miners, thanks to the rising demand for data centers that can power artificial intelligence-related (AI) machines.”  Research from JPMorgan suggests the same thing and, funnily enough, the investment bank's research says that IREN (the company Culper deems “not ready for AI”) is best positioned to capitalize on this resource-shifting trend.  Will Foxley, co-founder of Blockspace Media and host of the The Mining Pod, expressed skepticism about claims that Bitcoin mining facilities are suitable to transition to supporting AI computing.  “A lot of these bitcoin miners are just talking about how they can do AI when in reality they aren’t able to do it,” Foxley told CoinDesk.  Financial engineering-as-a-service  I’ve contended before that going public is dumb. One of the reasons is that it requires a company to shift to a short-term, quarterly earnings-focused mindset when long-term goals (such as growth into perpetuity or existing next decade) should be the focus. It also makes it such that if a company is struggling, everyone knows, which can make a company vulnerable.  Mining companies were struggling in 2022. Core Scientific (CORZ) even declared bankruptcy. And this was all before the Bitcoin halving in April 2024 cut deeply into miners’ revenue prospects. It was tough for miners in general and, because there are a bunch of public mining companies, competitors could pinpoint exactly who was struggling. Riot Platforms (RIOT) tried to take advantage of this situation and made a takeover bid for a smaller mining company, Bitfarms (BITF). Because BITF is public, RIOT didn’t need to call on BITF leadership and ask politely. Instead RIOT bought a lot of BITF stock in a hostile takeover attempt. This could have worked out well if RIOT was correct in assuming that its operation was better and more efficient than BITF’s, but we won’t ever know as the takeover attempt ultimately failed.  There are other financial tricks out there that can pad shareholder returns (or tank them if unsuccessful; RIOT’s stock is down 25% this year). One example is being purchased by mutual agreement, which is what Coreweave tried to do after it made its AI deal with Core Scientific. The offer was rejected, but it is telling that an AI company with growth aspirations looked at a bitcoin mining company and thought: “hold on a second, we need to grow our operations quick before the AI boat sails past us, and bitcoin miners have warehouses that we could retrofit for our use, so we should buy them.”  “I think some of these bitcoin companies are sitting on attractive power contracts and if you’re a huge data center hyperscaler like Coreweave, what’s a few billion dollars to go level a bitcoin mining site and throw up a new AI data center?” Foxley said. “Of course the takeover would be expensive, but you’re betting that the longevity of the power contract pays you back based both on the multiple you’re going to get being a public AI company and on the revenue of just being an AI company.”  Coreweave surely cannot be the only AI company thinking this.  Mining other coins  Mining companies used to mine ether before Ethereum shifted from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and so now these companies only mine bitcoin.  At least that was what most thought until Marathon (MARA) revealed it had been mining a relatively obscure cryptocurrency called Kaspa since September 2023. Kaspa is, by most measures, a completely random crypto that just so happens to be mineable. Marathon had access to space and electricity to throw at it, it seemed profitable, and so the company did it because profitable activity is good.  “By mining Kaspa, we are able to create a stream of revenue that is diversified from Bitcoin, and that is directly tied to our core competencies in digital asset compute,” said Adam Swick, Marathon’s chief growth officer, in a statement.  I think the mining of Kaspa, and potentially other coins, is more a novelty than a concrete industry shift, because I doubt another proof-of-work cryptocurrency will ever rise to prominence.  But Marathon's move further highlights the broader point: Bitcoin miners are hurting for revenue and profitability, and they are looking in places besides mining bitcoin to make up the difference.

42407827,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6CIr,1721326276,"SkyBridge's Anthony Scaramucci on Donald Trump, Gary Gensler and Bad Press","CoinDesk's Jennifer Sanasie interviewed SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci for CoinDesk TV's ""Spotlight Series."" Here is the full transcript of the interview.  Jennifer Sanasie: Hey, what's going on everyone? This is CoinDesk's Spotlight Series. Our next guest needs no introduction. Former White House communications director and SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci joins me now. Welcome to the show.  Anthony Scaramucci: Jen, good to be on with you. Thank you for including me.  Jennifer Sanasie: It's wonderful to see you again. And I have to ask you, do you hate that after only working in the White House for 11 days, you will forever be introduced as the former White House Communications Director?  Anthony Scaramucci: I've been called so much worse than that in my life, Jen. Mean, are you kidding me? It's fine. I mean, it's part of my life. I think you'll find somebody like me, I don't run from any aspect of my life. I own my mistakes. I'm trying to do better today than I did yesterday. And that was seven years ago, hard to believe. But again, listen, I got fired for a reason. I mishandled a few things in the White House. The president fired me. He had the right to do that. And we move on. I think it's a lesson for people.  Don't hang on things and if that's part of my legacy, so be it.  Jennifer Sanasie: You talk about that a lot in your book and it's really interesting because I think in today's day and age with social media, there's almost this, like, anxiety across everyone I talk to. People don't want to get canceled. They don't want to screw up in public because they think it's going to, you know, be a part of who you are forever. And I think you've maneuvered that pretty well. Does that, like, anxiety, that almost trauma of these events that have been very public come back to you? Or, like, how have you worked through that? Because that's a big feat.  Anthony Scaramucci: Well,I just wrote a book about this sort of stuff from Wall Street to the White House and back. I basically write in the book that if you're having a bad day, unless it's a health reason, it really can't be much worse than the day I had on the 31st of July 2017, where I was blown through the front door of the White House, excoriated by all the media, cable news pundits, late-night comedians. It was a rough go. I mean, you know, they were impersonating me on Saturday Night Live. And so you can take your mindset and you can decide which way you want to go. You can play a victim and say, what was me, or you can laugh about it and ride with it. And that's your mindset. You've got to make a decision about that. And, I've lived by and not always and not perfectly, but I have lived by what my grandmother used to say to us as kids. What other people think of you is none of your business. I remember coming home in the second or third grade complaining to her that there were boys in the cafeteria that were being mean to me. And I remember her scoffing at me, saying that I was absolutely ridiculous and wear big boy pants and don't listen to or ignore all that. And nothing is more true in the fishbowl of social media that we live in or negative articles that could be written about you. I will say this though, when we're doing well at SkyBridge, we don't get a lot of positive articles written about us. You know, there's an expression in the news media, when it bleeds, it leads. And so people like the train crash. I know President Biden is experiencing this right now. Would be a more interesting media story if he departed from the race as opposed to stay in it, you know, and so we are doing this to each other now. You have to make a decision either to ignore it and keep writing or let it absorb your thinking. I mean, one of the reasons why we're having so much stress psychologically in our society, even the Surgeon General is saying this now, is that we have a tendency to read the comments that others say about us on social media. And I would tell people, ignore that stuff. It has no relevance to you.  Jennifer Sanasie: I think that's great advice. I sometimes read the comments and it doesn't do good things. I gotta just stop doing that.  Anthony Scaramucci: Well, yeah, well, you know, know, you know, Kelly Anne Conway, the first day when I joined the White House, pretty good day. Did a press conference. I was upstairs in the second floor of the West Wing and Kelly Anne Conway took my phone from me, and she shut off all my notifications. And she says, don't even look at these things, just do your job. And I kept, you know, I mean, that was one of the bright spots from the White House. My first day was pretty good, my last day was pretty bad, but I have left my notifications off for the last seven years.  Jennifer Sanasie: Really smart. think I'm going to adopt that strategy. You know, the last time we spoke, I was a little tough on you. It was after the FTX fallout. That was another media frenzy that you had to go through. I know you were very close with Sam Bankman-Fried. There were business deals between the two of you. You publicly spoke about that relationship. When you look back at that now and you look at what the industry has done since then, I know you've answered this question before, but I think it's pertinent to revisit it. What lessons have you learned from that time and how have you embedded that into how you operate today and, more specifically, as you're running SkyBridge and looking more at crypto?  Anthony Scaramucci: I think it's a great question. I think that question, the answer to that question has evolved since you and I were talking about it. You know, when you were, and by the way, you were doing your job, which I respect. It was a tough situation. Think one of the things I like to do in tough situations is face the music. I just want you to imagine me reporting that I am now a hero on CNBC. Sam, who's a brilliant guy. He's the Mark Zuckerberg of crypto. He's bought 30% of my business. We're to have this generational transfer of knowledge and we're going go out and help him grow his business, grow our business, et cetera. Such great excitement. Nine short weeks later, I'm back on television having to tell people, unfortunately, I sold my business to somebody that we didn't know it at the time, but he was guilty of fraud. Mean, he was convicted of fraud and he's serving in jail cells. In a jail cell is a very, very painful experience. So I went from hero to zero in a nine week period of time. And it was a terrible situation for me. But I do think one, you have to face the music, you have to tell people what happened, how it happened, why you were involved with it. Number two, I think you have to live your life with integrity because I believe if you live your life with integrity, there's always opportunity for you. I can't tell you the number of positive things that happened to me after that debacle. And so when I sit here and reflect upon it now, I guess the good news is it looks like the investors are going to get their money back. Now, a lot of those investors, you're a crypto journalist, so you know a lot of those investors are sore. Why are they sore? They're sore because they owned a bitcoin or they own two bitcoin. It got dollarized at $17,000 a coin. Those coins went to $60,000. So they should technically have $120,000, but they don't. They have $34,000. But I think, life being what it is, we adjust our expectations. And I think people are gonna be happy that they got that money back because back in November of 2022, they were probably thinking, man, I'm probably not gonna get much money back. And so that's number one. So stay in things. Don't get yourself overly disillusioned. And I think the other thing, the other big lesson, of all this is there was lots of fraud in the industry, lots of overleverage in the industry. Know, people in the industry don't like Gary Gensler. I attended an event yesterday in Washington, D .C. with a number of legislators and Anita Dunn from the White House talking about why we in the industry need bipartisan positive crypto legislation. We shouldn't let one party hijack it versus the other. And, you, Mark Cuban, and he said, I could say this, I'll say it, Mark Cuban said: Just make sure if you leave this room and people are going to report about what happened in this room, make sure people know that I'm on record saying that I want Gary Gensler to be fired. And I said, OK, I'll make sure I share that with people, particularly people like Jenn at CoinDesk. The point about, yeah, yeah, well, I'll ask him to, but you know, the point that I'm making here is that weirdly Gary helped the industry.  Jennifer Sanasie: You gotta tell Mark to come on and share that with me.  Anthony Scaramucci: I'm going to explain why he ... he more or less broke the law by not approving the bitcoin ETF. There's an administrative law that says you can't be arbitrary and capricious. And of course, the futures ETF was approved. And so it would have made sense that, you know, you can't be arbitrary in the administration of law. The cash ETF should have been approved shortly thereafter. He delayed it. He lost the lawsuit as a result of that. But that delay, that 12-ish month delay, the bottom fell out on the industry. All the fraud got exposed. All the overleverage in the industry got exposed. And I think it's a sturdier industry today. And I think those prices for bitcoin are actually less levered, more sturdy. And of course, we have these ETFs that have gained a tremendous amount of cash inflows since they started in January. Three lessons, number one, something bad happens, get out there early, talk to people like Jenn at CoinDesk or go on the air, explain it. Number two, live your life with integrity. I didn't do anything wrong in that situation. I spent four and a half hours with the Department of Justice. They had no problem with anything that I did. And life goes on. And then the third thing is if you're in something and you believe it, stay in it. We have been remarkably rewarded at SkyBridge by doing.  Jennifer Sanasie: I want to get back to the political conversation in just a second, but I have to ask you on the topic of FTX, do you still talk to Sam or his family at all?  Anthony Scaramucci: It's been a while. I haven't talked to Sam. I know that my friend Bill Cohen went to go visit him in prison. I think it'd be tough for me to do that because of the fraud that was perpetrated against me and my clients. I do feel bad for Sam. I have a, I know this, shouldn't be saying this, maybe because I got raised Catholic. I have a soft spot for Sam. While I'm sore at him for what happened, I have forgiven him and I've moved on. And I a politician at some point in the future commutes that sentence. I don't want to see him be in jail for 25 years. People will more or less get their money back. He's got some issues, mental health-related issues. And I hope, I hope, that there's, you know, some level of rehabilitation for Sam in the.  Jennifer Sanasie: I think there are people who had a really bad experience, I guess you could say during the FTX's debacle, people are likely going to get paid back, like you said, now. But I think that there are people who went through that experience and feel like, you know, Sam was sentenced, it was a fair sentence, he shouldn't get out. What would you say to those people?  Anthony Scaramucci: I understand those people. Would say this is why democracies and varying thoughts are so fascinating. You have to work through these and good democracies are good debate. You're partially displeased and you're partially pleased. I guess what I would say to those people, they're right. And if that's where things go, then that's it. He'll serve his, typically in a situation like that, you serve of the 25 years if you've had good behavior in prison. And so then you'll end up serving 20 of the 25 years. And they're right and there really is no point of debate. Guess I have found in life that our ability to pardon people, our ability to forgive people is a benefit to us as opposed to not only just them, but as a benefit to us. When I was a kid, the Pope was shot. Before your time, but in 1981, he was shot in St. Peter's Square. Was almost mortally wounded. He survived the gunshot wound. They performed emergency surgery on him. And I guess it was a short time thereafter, when he felt up to it, he went to the prison and forgave the man that shot him. And a lot of people said, OK, well, that's above the call of duty of a human being, but it was a sign of his Christianity and a sign of the teachings of the religion that he was in. So I got raised Catholic, and I think about things like that. So that's me. Other people are in another direction. We could have the debate. If I lost that debate, what those people are saying is fair, and I would accept.  Jennifer Sanasie: OK, I think that's fair. I want to talk about your former boss now, Donald Trump. We learned that he's going to be speaking at a Bitcoin conference later this month. He's become this crypto-forward candidate. And I want to hear your real thoughts here. You know the guy, you worked for him. Is he being opportunistic? Is there authenticity in what he's saying?  Anthony Scaramucci: OK, yep. You know, you know what? I don't think it matters, you know, whether he's being opportunistic or transactional, which he is those things. I mean, as evidenced by his entire career, I don't think it matters. I think it's been incredibly good for crypto. I think this has been political malpractice on the part of the Democrats. For some reason, they ceded the crypto regulation to Elizabeth Warren and to Gary Gensler. It's been an unbelievable disaster for them. It's President Trump's election to lose now. President Biden has a decent record. He's reshorts and manufacturing. He's built up a microprocessor foundry in United States. He got infrastructure bill done. There's a lot of different things that he did that were beneficial to the country, helped the country heal post Covid. But they've really lost the plot on a lot of different things. If you can't put sentences together at a debate, if you can't as the president of United States without a teleprompter, and you can't free form as you and I are doing in this conversation, I think it's a big negative. Think you're trying to tell people, don't believe your lying eyes. This person is totally together and totally with it. And then let's put them up on stage at age 81 and you see him doddering. Feel, I feel actually bad for him. I guess what I would say to President Biden, there are graveyards filled with – Charles Seagal once said this – are graveyards filled with men that once thought they were indispensable. They would have been better off ceding to a new generation of Democratic leaders. And then Biden could have rode off in the sunset with a pretty good record. So now they're faced with this very rough decision to make 120 days out from the election. As it relates to Mr. Trump, I am happy that he's pro-crypto. I think if anything, he's pushed the conversation and forced the Democrats to be more open to ... and maybe we'll get rid of the Genslers and the Warrens, who have been a disaster for the industry. And I think it's been a disaster as public servants. So, you know, whatever my personal issues are with Mr. Trump – and I certainly won't be voting for him – I'm among the 40 or so people who work for him that see the danger of him, including the former vice president of the United States that was on the ballot with him. I, I often say to people, you got 40 people that worked at a pharmaceutical company.They were inside the doors of the pharmaceutical company and they came out and said, hey, the pill that you're about to take is going to kill you or members of your family. I don't know. Most people probably wouldn't take the pill. Or let's say we all worked at the automotive company. See the car that we just manufactured is going to blow up. I don't know. For some reason in politics, I have trumped arrangements in. I mean, somebody called me a never Trumper, Jenn. I laughed. Said, well, first of all, I was once a Trumper. So you definitionally, I'm not a never Trumper. If you want to say I have Trump derangement syndrome, that's fine. But I see myself as having Trump reality syndrome. I see the man for what he is. I see the lack of intellectual curiosity. I see the danger to the democracy. I see these think tanks that are working alongside of him that want to build his transition into the first few years of his presidency as a dystopian. And I'm not a one-issue voter. Now, there are one-issue voters, and I think the Democrats have made a horrific mistake here. They could have been neutral on crypto or positive on crypto. And I think it would have helped them in the election. But if they lose the election, and it's now President Trump's election to lose. But if the Democrats lose the election and they go through the autopsy, one of the things would be, wow, we really mishandled our cryptocurrency and digital asset strategy and ...  Jennifer Sanasie: Well, I, I would love to hear from you. What do you think it actually means? Polymarket has Trump at a 62 % chance of winning the election. If Trump actually wins the election, do we really see any change in the U.S. when it comes to the furthering of crypto legislation and crypto regulation? Or is that something that still drags?  Anthony Scaramucci: Well, I think so. No, think him and his team will promote a ... they'll put a pro-SEC, pro-crypto, pro-digital asset SEC commissioner in place. This whole discussion about what is the security and what's a token and all this stuff will go by the wayside. You know, the markets will have a pro-crypto friendly administration. It's no sweat off of Mr. Trump or any of the people working for to help this industry. This is a big mistake. Know, the Democrats, guess, the Libs and Warren things, let me block the industry here in the U.S. OK, well, the industry is going to grow around you and you're going to lose intellectual capital and capital capital. Well, there are bad actors in the industry. OK, there are, there are bad actors in this industry as there are in pharmaceutical, medicine, lawyers. ... There are bad actors on the planet. So you pick the subject or the profession. There are bad actors engaging in those subjects and profession. The job would have been better served if we got together as a group of people and said: ""Here's what bad actors do. Here's how we could regulate propitiously to prevent bad actions and protect investors."" But they don't do that. They're trying to regulate by enforcement. There's no guidelines anywhere. Everybody knows this. And so if we stop doing that, it'll be better for the country and the industry. And if we don't stop doing that, guys like President Trump will get elected because there's 50 million or so people that own crypto. They don't, they don't like this nonsense. And a lot of those people could be one-issue voters.  Jennifer Sanasie: Do you think that Biden should be the Democratic candidate?  Anthony Scaramucci: So I've been public on that. I said he should not be. think that, I think it's prima facie that he should not be. And I hope he steps down and I hope they pick a younger, more fresher candidate. If they decide not to do that, I will be with President Biden. I'll try to help him win. And that's it. Because I see President Trump as a danger. If Trump wins, it is what it is. I'm American. I love my country. Dissent is a positive force in the United States.  Jennifer Sanasie: And talk to me about this scenario. If Biden is not the Democratic candidate, it's someone else. What does that mean for crypto, in your opinion?  Anthony Scaramucci: I would be positive. We've to get rid of Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler. I think that would give them the opportunity to reset things. I think they would get, you know, remember, Biden's got a lot of acolytes in the White House with him that are directing policy. And I think a new person come in and say, ""hey, don't know those people don't care. Let's start.""  Jennifer Sanasie: Have you been following the Polifi tokens at all?  Anthony Scaramucci: I haven't, no, not that familiar.  Jennifer Sanasie: They're, well, meme coins that are people making bets on Trump and Biden. There's like, it's just silly. I was curious if you were following that.  Anthony Scaramucci: Yeah, no, I haven't, haven't followed that. So maybe I'm getting old. I don't know. That's not something I would follow.  Jennifer Sanasie: Yeah, you don't have to. It is a little silly. I know on a more serious token that you have $100,000 bitcoin prediction by the end of the year. For you, what needs to happen to get.  Anthony Scaramucci: Well, I think we got to get through the FTX situation and, you know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I meant to say the Mt. Gox situation because I want to bring up FTX in a second because they're conjoined. If we get through the Mt. Gox situation, the bitcoins or and I'm going to be a recipient of some of those and I'm not selling mine. If we get those and the marketplace digest those, concomitant to that is the FTX situation. Let me tell you what that is. There's 16 or so billion dollars of cash.  Jennifer Sanasie: We're not through it yet. OK.  Anthony Scaramucci: That's going to be unleashed by the bankruptcy estate into the account holders of FTX. Now, some of those people, as we pointed out, are sore. They feel that they are owed more than that because their bitcoins or tokens went up. But, you know, getting that cash, $16 billion, could five or 10 billion of that reenter cryptocurrencies? It's possible. And that could also create some buying pressure in the marketplace. But I think just in general, the selling cycle has started on Wall Street. And I do believe that model portfolios will have one, two, three, four percent bitcoin over the next three, four, five years. There's less supply of bitcoin and it will push the prices.  Jennifer Sanasie: All right, Anthony, we are running low on time. And just before we go, I do have to ask you: there was an article published in Bloomberg today. It says that you barred clients from exiting SkyBridge Capital's crypto-focused hedge fund. Talk to me about what's going on there.  Anthony Scaramucci: So I actually didn't read the article. I know this is an article from Kathy Burton who wrote my financial obituary last May. She basically said we were going out of business and our performance was terrible. And there were some truth in the article from last May. We did have bad performance. I didn't like the fact that, you know, she sat for an interview with me for three hours. Didn't, I mean, she offered no counterdote to her obituary to Skybridge is a low and behold, and I hope this is in the article, we've had very very good performance amount allowed to talk about it but hopefully it's in the article and then Kathy's trying to say that I'm blocking people from leaving, but that's not what happened. What, what happened was people bought our fund we have a prospectus a prospectus allows us to set the redemptions we have redemptions every six months in our fund and we can set them from five to 25%. They're set at five right now because some of the wirehouses at the bottom put cells on our fund. Those wirehouses know that we have private capital in the fund alongside of the liquid capital, and we can't have a rush to the exits of their clients at the detriment of the other clients that are in there. So we have an external board, independent board that sets those redemptions. And so there are some people that are sore at us for living inside of the prospectus and setting the redemptions at 5%. They can still get out and they are getting out the ones that want to. But it does protect the integrity of the portfolio. And as a fiduciary, I would ask people to please look at what our performance is. You can figure it out. I can't talk about it, but it's very, very good. And it's very, very good for that reason. If we had let the world turn in a way that was outside of our control, it would have detrimented the clients that wanted to stay with us. And those clients signed a prospectus. They signed an agreement with us and we are letting them out. We're just letting them out not as quickly as some would like. And they're complaining to Kathy Burton and she doesn't like me for some reason. That's fine. We, you and I spent the first part of this podcast talking about how you have to deal with that in life and not take it too personally. I would imagine if we're up 40 % this year, which is quite possible, she'll probably write another article. Maybe it'll be another negative article. I don't know. But it's something that I can live with. And I've had this conversation with many of our clients. And I would tell people, read the prospectuses of the things that you are investing in very carefully. And SkyBridge is operating inside of the guidelines of that, and we are delivering great performance for our clients. And believe it or not, we're raising money again away from the people that are complaining.  Jennifer Sanasie: As a quick follow up to that, know, maybe talk to me a little bit about some of the factors that first led to the curtailing of redemption in 2022 and how they have or haven't changed now. Just trying to make sense of the article here because I don't want to discredit her.  Anthony Scaramucci: No, when you have a 15-year relationship with the wirehouses and the wirehouses, you have one bad quarter and the wirehouses say, ""OK, we're done. We want all of our clients out immediately. We're extinguishing our 15-year relationship with you and you can no longer market to our clients. And we want every one of our clients to redeem immediately,"" which is what they try to do to these funds. This is why many of my friends in the hedge fund industry are like ""Anthony, you made a terrible mistake having wirehouses distribute your product because they're very whimsical about when they pull the plug."" And these wirehouses pull the plug at the bottom, Jenn, you know, we're up a lot of percent. I'm not allowed to get into the details, but go take a look. These wirehouses sold us here and we are not there anymore. We're way over here. And so we have to defend the portfolio. That's our fiduciary responsibility. And so really nothing has changed. The major thing, people will get out. They'll get out on a timely way. A lot of people. There are also a ton of people – sure Kathy did interview these people – but there are tons of those I think I'd you did that because my clients want to stay in and there's pressure on me to get them out and you allowed me to show my clients that you guys are actually doing a great job. So there's another group of people that have said that so really nothing has changed. I love, I love the attention though. I have to be honest about that. So hopefully she'll write another article, you'll invite me on and we'll talk about it again.  Jennifer Sanasie: That is something we have learned about you, Anthony, is that you don't shy away from the attention.  Anthony Scaramucci: Yeah, it's no problem. Tell Kathy I say hello. If I dated her in high school and I hurt her feelings or something like that, tell her I'm sorry about it. Didn't mean to do  Jennifer Sanasie: We gotta wrap it there, Anthony.

The price of the coin crossed $490 at the time, but has since fallen more than 90% from its all-time high since then. After an extended bear period, it is starting to look like this altcoin may never return to its previous glory again. However, this might be wrong as expectations for another bull run for the MOVR altcoin are rising once again. MOVR Ready To Move Out Of Extended Consolidation According to a crypto analyst, the MOVR price may be getting ready to move out of a drawn out downtrend and complete its consolidation. This consolidation trend had begun when the price had started falling, and the price fell into a descending channel. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are On The Move Again – Here’s What They’re Doing This Time However, with the market recovery, it seems that the altcoin is ready to move out of this consolidation, the result of which would be a major move upward. Some of the bullish developments are the engulfed candlestick pattern and the quick reaction and internal trendily. As the crypto analyst explains in the TradingView post, the engulfed candlestick pattern is bullish as it suggests that the MOVR downtrend may finally be headed toward a reversal. While the latter, the quick reaction and internal trend line show that because the altcoin reacted swiftly to its support level while approaching its internal trend line, it shows that bullish momentum is building for the price. From here, the altcoin has established key support, which could help push its price further. While in the other case, once the uptrend begins, the MOVR price will have the $22 resistance to contend with if the price is to regain its momentum from here. How High Can Price Go? Given that the market is rebounding and trader sentiment for coins like MOVR is back on the high side, the possibilities for a massive breakout have grown. The analyst points out that the market remains optimistic, which is a good sign for the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Developer Samson Mow Says BTC Will Rise To $1 Million, Here’s When To properly confirm the breakout, the crypto analyst says the resistance at $22 will be the determining factor. If this level is clear, then the price is expected to blow out. The first possible high is at $199, which is a 1,026% increase in price. However, in the scenario where the MOVR price rally continues, the crypto analyst sees the price going as high as $234. In this case, it would mean an over 2,000% increase in price, but would still be around 40% below its all-time high price of $495.

BTC plunged to $63,500 from $65,000 in just two hours during mid-morning trading hours in the U.S., and was down 1.7% over the past 24 hours. The second-largest cryptocurrency ether {{ETH}} and Solana's native token {{SOL}} held up somewhat better, though each were also lower by more than 1%.  Smaller digital assets fell even more, sending the broad-market benchmark Coindesk 20 Index (CD20) lower by 2.8%. Leading the drop were 5%-6% declines for Ripple's XRP {{XRP}}, Polkadot's DOT {{DOT}}, Cardano's {{ADA}} and Polygon's token {{MATIC}}.  The price action happened as U.S. equities found themselves unable to bounce from sizable declines earlier this week, with the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 down another 1% and the broad-based S&P 500 dropping 0.7%.  Uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election rose markedly in recent hours amid reports of mounting pressure from top party figures for President Biden not to seek re-election.  Traders on the crypto-based prediction market Polymarket now see an 80% chance of Biden dropping out, up from 40% a day earlier. Meanwhile, odds for Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the Democratic nominee for the presidential race jumped to 63% from 15% a day ago.  Alongside, GOP nominee Donald Trump's chances to win slightly tapered off on Polymarket to 65%, down from a 70% high after surviving an assassination attempt last weekend.

31170127,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630370,1721320235,"Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $1.03 Soon, Warns Of Initial Dip","The XRP price has staged an impressive rally in recent days, but this came to an abrupt end yesterday. After rising to as high as $0.6378, it plummeted by more than 11% temporarily. Nevertheless, the popular crypto analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) remains bullish in the short-term, even if the dip could widen further in the short term. XRP Price Could Eclipse The $1 Mark Again According to him, the XRP price is in a promising short-term uptrend towards the $1.03 mark. This analysis is based on the 4-hour timeframe and shows a complex interplay of market dynamics and technical patterns that suggest a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. The chart shared by Dark Defender shows XRP’s significant rally, marked by a 67.56% increase from a low of $0.3814 to a recent high of $0.6378. The forecast uses Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci retracement levels to predict the price target. Both technical analysis tools are often used to predict potential price levels based on past market behavior. Elliott Wave Theory, which forms a central component of Dark Defender’s analysis, posits that market prices unfold in specific patterns, called waves, that are repetitive in nature. According to this theory, a typical cycle includes eight waves—five in the direction of the prevailing trend followed by three corrective waves, which Dark Defender identifies on the XRP chart. Related Reading: XRP Surges 39% As Sharks & Whales Push Supply Share Past 85% The impulse sequence observed in XRP’s recent uptrend consists of five upward waves labeled (1) through (5). This sequence shows a strong bullish move from the local low to yesterday’s high. Each wave peaked higher than the last, reflecting increasing optimism among investors. Following the impulse, the chart delineates an ABC corrective pattern, which is characteristic of a temporary reversal in price following the rapid gains of the impulse waves. Wave A signifies the initial drop from the peak, wave B reflects a partial retracement upwards, and wave C, which is anticipated but not yet completed, typically falls below the end of wave A, indicating a further potential decrease in price. Dark Defender’s chart marks the beginning of this corrective phase, suggesting that wave C could bring the price down to around $0.499 before the market resumes its upward trajectory. “The ABC wave can take 2 days to complete & can extend to $0.499,” the crypto analyst noted. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Debunks Ripple-SEC Settlement Rumor For Tomorrow To complement the Elliott Wave analysis, Dark Defender employs Fibonacci retracement levels, which are drawn between the recent low and high points on the chart to predict potential support and resistance levels. Notably, a 261.8% extension level at $0.5891 is highlighted as an interim resistance point. Further extensions, like a 161.8% level at $0.8763, serve to identify additional barriers the price might test if the bullish momentum continues. However, Dark Defender’s short-term price target is significantly higher. According to him, XRP could revisit the $1 mark, which was narrowly missed after the summary judgment in the Ripple vs. SEC case in mid-July last year. “Minor resistance at $0.87 before $1.03. I’ll make sure to keep you posted,” the analyst wrote. Moreover, the chart features an Ichimoku Cloud, indicating that the current price is above the cloud, which is traditionally interpreted as a bullish signal. This suggests that despite the expected corrective dip, the overall market conditions favor a bullish outlook in the short-term. At press time, XRP traded at $0.58.

That's another story.  The Barstool Sports chief took ""a big portion"" of his sponsorship deal with the crypto exchange Kraken in BTC, Portnoy told CoinDesk. Kraken paid him directly in the cryptocurrency along with dollars, the pair said. Neither party wanted to discuss how much money changed hands.  Wearing his ""day trader"" hat, Portnoy has tried timing trades in the bitcoin market since mid-2020, often getting burned buying high and selling low. Its current price above $60,000 is too high for him. ""I'd just hate myself. If I buy it right now – a ton of it – and it goes down, we'll have a problem in my brain.""  Still, Portnoy said he's ""always"" willing to take bitcoin as payment: ""I believe in it that much."" He did so in February when Kraken began sponsoring his ""Davey Day Trader Global"" (DDTG) livestream.  Despite its original billing as peer-to-peer electronic cash, bitcoin is seldom treated as a form of money. The occasional celebrity athlete signs a ""paid in bitcoin"" sponsorship. Those usually involve turning cash checks into crypto, as opposed to getting paid in bitcoin itself, as Kraken did for Portnoy.  Instead, bitcoin attracts everyday investors who, like Portnoy, think ""it's a good investment.""  The pizza reviewer is betting ""it's gonna rip"" if pro-bitcoin Republican Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election in November, as Portnoy believes he will. But Portnoy cautions: ""I'm always wrong.""

42407829,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6CSm,1721317329,DePIN Allows Us to Be Stakeholders in the Machine Economy,"Over the past few years, robots have been taking on more and more roles in the economy, estimated to wipe out up to 375 million jobs by 2030. The AI boom we see now will only accelerate this process, enabling smart machines to capture even more of the value creation chain. The process will take on many forms, from gargantuan end-to-end systems, like Xiaomi’s brand-new fully autonomous smartphone factory or Amazon’s smart warehouses, to smaller ones like delivery robots bringing you pizza.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  At the receiving end of this are people — people who have been assembling those smartphones, sorting parcels, and, well, bringing pizzas. One could argue that robots are sparing them the stress and effort of menial jobs. One could also argue that robots pushed them out of jobs, period. Often enough, automation turns into a zero-sum game: As robots do more, there’s overall fewer jobs for people, so those replace have to compete for an ever-shrinking pie.  Sure, let’s not look over the nuance. Automation doesn’t just eliminate jobs, it also creates them. Fewer jobs, granted, and usually more demanding in terms of skills and education. A self-driving taxi service would create new jobs for engineers and AI specialists, but how many cabbies would be able to upskill into those roles?  No wonder taxi drivers are going up in arms against autonomous cars. No wonder humble delivery bots are facing attacks as well, and there’s even stories of tea picker robots drawing people’s ire after pushing thousands out of jobs. People see technology encroaching on their livelihood and their ability to put food on the table, and as they connect the dots, they don’t like the picture it all comes to: A world where the few profit from automation while millions are left without means to survive.  But, as it happens, Web3 can help.  From victims to stakeholders  People fear automation because it appears to render them helpless in the face of a bigger-than-life process changing the world at their detriment. The only cure to this is transforming the very foundation of this process by making everyone a stakeholder in it, not its victim, and that’s where Web3 comes into play.  Let’s start with an anecdote. People don’t tend to be too nice to car sharing and rental vehicles. However, after tokenizing a number of vehicles managed by a Viennese car-sharing operator, we noticed something completely different. People with a stake in the car’s revenues treated the Teslas like their own cars. Not a week went by without someone taking the car out for a wash, or cleaning its interior, or doing something equally helpful, even though they didn’t have to. There were no rewards for that, even though the provider did appreciate it a lot. Still, the tangible sense of stake was the game-changer which made people view these Teslas as assets, not threats.  Here’s where Web3 has a role to play, specifically the notion of real-world assets (RWAs). By tokenizing a machine — in other words, representing certain rights to it, such as a cut in its revenues — as on-chain tokens, you get the perfect instrument for making everyone a stakeholder in the automation, a trustless mechanism that will never depend on the goodwill of a centralized entity. Imagine that automated smartphone factory distributing a portion of its revenues between its token holders — Web3 can make that happen.  Read more: Mahesh Ramakrishnan - Without High Switching Costs, Telecom Looks Vulnerable to DeWi  Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) have the same potential to defuse the ticking socio-economic time bomb as they provide a framework for automated devices of any complexity to create value on behalf of their owners. From smartphones and drones to vehicles, DePINs enable people to do more with their everyday devices, earning tokens for providing real-world services. As our devices grow smarter, they will be able to do more, and by doing more, they will enable new DePIN use cases and more opportunities to earn rewards. And with that, once again, we will be stakeholders, not victims, as the world moves from centralized infrastructures to community-owned ones.  There is no stopping innovation, but we, as a society, must always be mindful of those who pay the toll for it. Automation promises companies billions in new revenues, but it threatens to leave millions of people unable to make ends meet. With a process as impactful, it’s crucial to make sure it doesn’t just benefit the few — and with machine RWAs and DePINs, we can secure a future where we all have a stake in the booming machine-powered economy.

Rune has showed strength, recovering by around 23% during the previous week following a recent fall to $3.10. At $4.22 right now, the coin is attracting both traders and analysts, with some even seeing a solid upward path. Related Reading: $174 In Sight: Analyst Projects Major Surge For Solana (SOL) Market Statistics And Growing Hope With a market capitalization of $1.41 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $207 million as of the most recent figures, THORChain represents a 0.06% market domination. Driven partly by the bullish phase in the bitcoin market, the token’s recent 2.27% growth in the previous 24 hours shows a good momentum. The market has become more hopeful after Bitcoin’s latest climb beyond the important $65,000 level. Rune like other cryptocurrencies is profiting from this surge of optimism as investors try to profit from the increasing trend. Furthermore predicted to boost the market is the forthcoming release of Ethereum ETFs on July 23rd. Technical Examination Renowned crypto expert Jonathan Carter has underlined in a thorough study THORChain’s potential for notable returns. Carter says that Rune could hit $7.40 if it can effectively bounce off the barrier of declining resistance line. For traders, this level would show a strong comeback and a clear positive indication. #RUNE THORChain is looking great on weekly chart🤔 If it can bounce from the descending resistance, the next target is $7.40🎯 A breakout higher could lead to a move towards $20🚀 pic.twitter.com/7DMYarvIdD — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) July 16, 2024 A better breakout may drive the token near the $20 target. Such an action would indicate a much more significant upside since THORChain can surpass existing resistances and sustain its upward momentum. The bitcoin community has taken notice of this positive view as many of them keep a careful eye on RUNE in search of any indication of a breakout. THORChain Price Prediction Based on forecast, THORChain’s price is predicted to climb by 28.92% and reach $5.76 by August 17, 2024. Several technical indicators corroborate this projection; the Fear & Greed Index shows a 61 (Greed) score while the present mood is neutral. THORChain has registered 16 out of 30 so-called “green days” during the previous month, with a 7.50% price volatility. These elements imply that right now may be a good time to acquire THORChain. General Market Impact And Investor Mood Thanks in part to Bitcoin’s current performance, the positive phase of the larger cryptocurrency market is giving altcoins like THORChain a suitable backdrop. The forthcoming release of Ethereum ETFs is expected to generate more positive attitude into the market, therefore supporting Rune’s rebound and maybe breakout. According to historical trends, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs had a notable favorable effect on the market, pushing many cryptocurrencies to fresh all-time highs. With the rollout of Ethereum ETFs, a similar trajectory is seen to create conditions fit for THORChain to profit from these advantages.

In Ask an Expert, A. Rafay, from Zignaly, answers questions about on-chain fund management.  –S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  How the Marriage of Web3 and Web2 Gives Birth to Mass Adoption in Crypto  This year, we have made significant strides in crypto with the launch of spot BTC and ETH ETFs. While this is celebrated as a step towards mainstream adoption, true adoption should come from on-chain usage rather than just ownership. Bootstrapping users is challenging, even with tokens as financial incentives, due to unfamiliar steps like creating a wallet with long seed phrases and acquiring cryptocurrency for gas fee payments. These hurdles, along with poor perceptions of blockchain security and concerns about fraud, have turned many users away.  However, three fast-growing blockchain ecosystems are addressing these challenges by combining the strengths of Web2 and Web3 to create a seamless Web2-like onboarding experience while providing users with the benefits of sovereign ownership in Web3.  Base: Web 2.5 to Web 3  If you have a Coinbase account, congratulations! You are already in Web 2.5 by accessing crypto through a centralized exchange. While decentralized exchanges and other on-chain activities often turn away crypto-curious users due to complexity, Base, developed by Coinbase, aims to bridge their Web2.5 users to Web3. Integrated into Coinbase’s mobile and web applications, Base offers easy fiat on and off ramps from the exchange. Coinbase’s UI improvements, such as Smart Wallet for a Web2-like login experience and Magic Spend to abstract gas payments, simplify the process. Additionally, Base is developing a vibrant ecosystem with DeFi applications like Aerodrome and Moonwell, and social applications like Degen, making on-chain interactions more enjoyable and rewarding.  TON: Web2 to Web3  While Base targets crypto-curious users, TON’s potential TAM is even bigger, targeting the 900 million users on Telegram. Launched in 2023, Telegram quickly became a top-five Web2 social app by users globally and the dominant app in Russia, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. TON, The Open Network, was initially designed by founding members of the Telegram team to integrate blockchain into Telegram's ecosystem. Given Telegram’s multi-country user base and unique geopolitical backdrop, a unified crypto payment rail could be highly beneficial. TON’s integration into Telegram includes seamless wallet creation, in-app purchases and fiat onboarding. Telegram has also made ad payments in TON, with 50% revenue sharing with creators.  TON has spurred significant growth in Web3 applications. Notcoin, a click-to-earn game, attracted over 35 million players and 6.5 million daily active users in just two months. Similarly, Catizen, developed by Asian builders experienced in WeChat mini-apps, gained 20 million users and more than $10 million in revenue, marking the fastest revenue growth in Web3 dApps history.  Source: Folious Venture  Solana: Web3 to Everywhere  Solana, known for its high-performance blockchain, has taken significant steps towards mass adoption with Blinks. Blinks abstracts on-chain transactions into a simple URL that can be embedded in any Web2 business, simplifying the process of interacting with blockchain technology. Users can perform on-chain transactions by clicking a URL, eliminating the need for complex wallet setups. This makes it easier for Web2 businesses to integrate blockchain functionality into their existing operations.  The Internet, created in the 70s, only achieved mass adoption in the 2000s. As we enter the 15th year of BTC's creation, the fusion of Web2 and Web3 is accelerating the adoption of blockchain technology, enabling the mainstream to use and benefit from this new technology. On-chain is the new online.  - Kelly Ye, portfolio manager and head of research, Decentral Park Capital  Ask an Expert  Q: Why would fund managers adopt on-chain fund management?  A: For starters, on-chain fund management lets fund managers track transactions transparently in real-time. This reduces fraud and other lapses and boosts investors’ trust – a primary pillar of long-term adoption.  On-chain transactions and automation with smart contracts directly reduce fund management costs and other administrative overheads. From securities transfers to payments, on-chain systems can be significantly more efficient than traditional methods.  Besides, unlike their tradFi counterparts, on-chain assets are borderless, available 24x7, and offer near-instant settlements.  Fund managers get access to broader asset classes, like tokenized real estate, NFTs, as well as novel revenue-generating sectors like DeFi, yield farming, etc. This enables products and services unthinkable in conventional fund management.  Additionally, on-chain fund management systems are as secure as the underlying blockchains and let firms keep complete custody over the funds instead of relying on a third party. This strengthens trust in on-chain fund management.  Q: How will the rise of on-chain fund management impact traditional financial institutions and their business models?  A: Sooner or later, they will also come on-chain.  TradFi institutions can no longer afford to ignore transparency or keep their costs high. They must adopt new and innovative technologies to stay relevant and competitive.  The shift has started. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund is riding the tokenization tide, recently crossing $500 million in value. Meanwhile, VanEck, 21Shares, etc. are pushing for SOL ETFs, next in line after BTC and ETH.  There is also a growing demand for tokenized assets, smart contract-based services, decentralized AI-based system, and other related technologies.  - A Rafay, co-founder, Zignaly.

42407832,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6CZO,1721312566,"Germany Dumping $2.8B Bitcoin Is 'Market Intervention,' Despite Murky Legal Justifications","The process of Germany offloading seized bitcoin is called by experts ""market intervention"" as it caused a selloff.  The law that the authorities cited as the reason for the sale, falls within a ""legal gray"" line, according to one observer.  Germany may have finally come out with a legal reason why they offloaded nearly $3 billion worth of bitcoin {{BTC}} into the open market, but industry experts aren't sold on the reasoning.  Germany seized about 50,000 bitcoin in January from the operator of Movie2k.to, a website the state of Saxony found guilty of money laundering and other illegal activities. The state, with the help of Frankfurt-based German securities trading bank Bankhaus Scheich Wertpapierspezialist AG, and the Federal Criminal Police Office, sold about 49,858 bitcoin between June 19 and July 12, securing 2.6 billion euros ($2.8 billion), according to a statement on Wednesday.  The move perplexed traders and put severe pressure on the price of bitcoin while the authorities stayed mum on the reasons behind the selling spree. The selloff pressure was intensified at the time as the market was also cautious of mass selling by Mt. Gox creditors and faster liquidations by bitcoin miners.  Prices bottomed early this month at around $53,500 after Saxony completed its liquidation process but not before wreaking havoc on the market as BTC fell over 7% in June.  When the authorities finally issued a statement this week, the process was called a ""market-friendly sale,"" which ""was gentle on the market."" The statement claimed that ""a fair market price was always achieved"" and said that ""at this scale, there is no direct influence on the bitcoin price.""  However, some experts aren't convinced.  Romina Bungert, adviser to Enzyme and ex-CFO Centrifuge, told CoinDesk, ""This is a perfect example for the kind of unintentional malicious activity based on a lack of competence that can come from governments and authorities."" She added: ""How they handled this sell-off moved the market and is intervention in public market. ... So, who will have an incentive now to hold this national authority accountable? Not the state.""  In an email to CoinDesk, Patrick Pintaske, prosecutor and press spokesman of the Head of Special Procedures Division (UA BV), said: ""The legally regulated emergency sale means that we cannot wait to see whether and how the market value will change. The economic value of seized assets should be preserved as far as possible for later judicial confiscation.""  Bad timing  The German authority may have justified its decision to sell, but market observers have questioned the timing of the sale and the benefit to taxpayers.  Philipp Hartmannsgruber, a Bitcoin {{BTC}} expert who isn't convinced by the reasons laid out in Wednesday's statement, said the sale earned around 600 million euros more than what the BTC was worth when seized in January. ""How much could the taxpayer have made if bitcoin had been held for the long-term? At the current bitcoin exchange rate of around EUR 60,000, they would be worth around 390 million euros more today.""  Hartmannsgruber, who regularly advises politicians and authorities as a board member of the Blockchain Bundesverband e.V. (German Blockchain Association), specifically argued that the sale should not have been done ""during the announcement that up to 140,000 bitcoin worth approximately $7.7 billion from the Mt. Gox lawsuit will come to the market"" even though he emphasized that perfect timing is never possible.  Hartmannsgruber also asked the authorities to point to sources behind their claim that ""less than one percent of the market volume of bitcoins was regularly traded over the counter (OTC) and had ""no direct influence on the bitcoin price.""  ""This may not be the case on July 8, 2024, when up to 16,309 BTC worth approximately 830 million euros were sold,"" he said. ""If 16,300 bitcoin are sold in one day, this can have an enormous impact under certain circumstances.""  Legal 'grey line'  The statement argued that the authorities did not have a choice but to sell. However, some experts point to a grey area because the boundaries when you need to sell as an act of emergency seem a bit less clear. The court did not require selling the bitcoin because the statement said the proceedings were only ""provisionally secured"" as the concerned court has not yet made a decision on the confiscation becoming legally binding.  The decision, the statement said, was made because ""the sale of valuable items before the conclusion of ongoing criminal proceedings is legally required whenever there is a risk of a significant loss of value of around ten percent or more."" It further argued that given the volatility in the bitcoin market ""these conditions were always met.""  And, indeed, bitcoin drops 10% in short time frames fairly often.  Lawyer and partner at GSK, Timo Bernau indicated the authorities had banked on a general principle from a legal precedent to justify their sale. ""In German law, a general ban on speculation is assumed for public authorities. Such a ban on speculation with public funds is derived from the budgetary principle of economic efficiency and economy,"" Bernau said pointing to a 2017 ruling by the Federal Court of Justice.  Bungert noted that there was a legal ""gray line"" because ""the rules for this government agency on handling digital assets are not covered by the existing rule set."" Hartmannsgruber argued the authorities cited Section 111p of the Code of Criminal Procedure to suggest they had no choice but to sell the bitcoin. However, the law states that after ""an object that has been seized … may be sold if there is a risk of its spoilage or a significant loss of value.""  ""The law therefore does not provide for an obligation, but merely an opportunity to sell. It is therefore questionable whether the disposal was legally required,"" Hartmannsgruber said.  ""Although there are legal reasons why the Attorney General's Office acted in this way, if it was not obliged to do so, the question arises as to why it nevertheless acted in this way and why it presented its actions as a supposed duty.""

31163932,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630401,1721309457,"Why Did The German Government Sell Off 50,000 Bitcoin In 2 Weeks","The German government has sold all of its Bitcoin (BTC) in just two weeks. The reason for the substantial Bitcoin dump was unveiled in a recent statement by the Saxony Central Office for the Protection and Realization of Virtual Currencies. Why Germany Sold All Its Bitcoin In a blog post published on July 16, the Saxon Central Office and Frankfurt Bankhaus Scheich Wertpapierspezialist AG, a German securities trading bank, announced that they had successfully completed the sale of approximately 49,858 BTC. Starting on June 19, 2024, the German government began to sell off its massive Bitcoin reserves, officially concluding sales on July 12, 2024. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are On The Move Again – Here’s What They’re Doing This Time The government disclosed that the sale proceeds had amounted to €2.63 billion, with the funds remaining provisionally secured for the criminal proceedings related to the “movie2k” complex. The backstory behind the German government’s substantial Bitcoin holdings involves a digital asset seizure from movie2k, a notorious and now-defunct movie piracy website. Earlier in January 2024, the government seized 50,000 BTC, worth over €2.1 billion at the time, from the operator of the movie2k website. Unlike some global jurisdictions that might hold onto the seized digital assets, German law mandates their liquidation. This mandate is part of an “emergency sale” under Article 111p of the Code Of Criminal Procedure. As a result, the Dresden Public Prosecutor Office had no alternative but to sell off their Bitcoin stash which was transferred by the accused at short notice. Germany’s Bitcoin sale was also driven by its legal obligation to liquidate valuable assets before the conclusion of ongoing criminal proceedings, particularly when there is a threat or risk of significant loss. Considering Bitcoin’s notorious volatility and its penchant for rapid price fluctuations, the threat of loss was always present and, therefore, necessitated the sale. Moreover, any speculation of prices or waiting on the rising value of the seized assets by the prosecuting authority is strictly prohibited in an emergency sale, which is expected to be carried out as quickly as possible. This is because the current value of Bitcoin and other price influential circumstances are irrelevant in deciding where and when to execute an emergency sale. Germany Conducts Market-Friendly BTC Sale During its blog post, the Saxony Central Office for the Protection and Realization of Virtual Currencies disclosed that the government had conducted a “market-friendly and appropriate sale of Bitcoins.” The government had initiated multiple BTC dumps in small tranches over a period of approximately three and half weeks, taking into consideration how substantial BTC sell-offs can significantly impact the market. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 450% Move For Shiba Inu To Reach New All-Time High According to the government, approximately 49,858 BTC was transferred on January 16, 2024, representing a total value of €1.96 billion at the time, with an average purchase rate of about €39,400. Looking ahead, the price of Bitcoin was not severely impacted by the German government’s substantial lofty sell-off. A crypto analyst, Simon Dedic revealed in an X post that the price of BTC has surged by almost 23% since Germany’s Bitcoin dump and is now trading at a higher level than on June 19 when the government began transferring funds.

Despite the Bitcoin halving event, HIVE's mining operations remain resilient with a focus on efficiency and cost reduction. Mining difficulty has come down but should come down further to create an upside in digital asset prices. There are also election-related risks on the horizon that could induce volatility to the stock, explaining my Hold position. Still, opportunities for growth in the HPC (high-performance computing) sector, potential revenue increase, and long-term potential for investors. Since I last covered Hive Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) in my bullish piece in December last year, its share price surged by 17% to $5.8 in a market frenzy following regulators approving several Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). After several ups and downs, it now trades around $4 as charted below. Data by YCharts Nearly seven months later, this thesis aims to provide an update on the crypto miner's production and financial performance in the aftermath of the uncertainty-inducing Bitcoin halving event and assess whether its diversification into HPC or high-performance computing remains on track. At the same time, by factoring both opportunities related to the mining landscape and emerging uncertainties on the political front, I emphasize the need for caution. I start by providing an update on the way HIVE has navigated through the transition to the post-halving event which saw miners being rewarded only 3.125 BTC for each block added to the Bitcoin blockchain compared to 6.250 BTC previously. Resilient Mining Operations and More Efficient Than Peers The immediate effect of halving was the number of Bitcoins produced per day dropping from above seven in March to four in June as shown in the table below. To this end, April constituted more of a transition month as the halving occurred on the 19th which makes it essential to assess production both before and after. The result shows that due to lower mining rewards, monthly production dropped to 119 from 224. Table built using data from (seekingalpha.com) Despite this 47% drop, the number of Bitcoins HODLed or produced but not sold, kept increasing from 2,287 in March to 2,496 in June, with the number having grown to 2,503 on July 7. This shows that the company did not have to dispose of its treasury to finance operating costs as other miners have been doing in the wake of the halving. One of the reasons is that it has been able to control operating expenses, namely by keeping administrative costs as a percentage of revenues lower compared to others as charted below. In this case, while the other miners like Marathon Digital ( MARA ) and Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) have also drastically cut costs, HIVE, as seen in the blue chart has seen better success in cost control. charts built using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) Pursuing further, one of the ways to reduce costs is to continuously upgrade the machinery with those bearing the best energy efficiency so that less power is used for production. Thus, as per the President and CEO, 2,150 S21 Pro miners from supplier Bitmain are expected to be installed by the end of July to increase production capacity to 5.5 EH/s . This represents a 22% increase compared to the March capacity (as per the above table) and means that henceforth, monthly production should continue to increase to exceed the 119 BTCs produced in June. Consequently, while suffering from a drop in output like other miners, HIVE has demonstrated resiliency in the way it has tackled Bitcoin halving, but, going forward, from 900 Bitcoins , the total daily Bitcoin production will drop to 450 making efficiency a very important metric to watch out for. For this purpose, the Antminer S21 Pro's advantage is while it boasts a higher productive capacity also boasts a lower energy consumption of 15.0 J/TH compared to 17.5 J/TH for the currently used Antminer S21. This implies that by consuming less energy, it also lowers the cost per bitcoin produced, thereby enhancing its competitive position in the mining industry. Opportunities Due to Lower Mining Difficulty but Volatility Risks have Emerged The company could also benefit from a reduction in mining difficulty from 88 to 79.5 as shown in the chart below. This is due to a decrease in miners participating in (or adding blocks to) the network. This is probably the result of other miners reducing output as operations are no longer financially viable or some are going out of business altogether if financially not strong enough to digest the halving of mining rewards. For investors, this remains a highly competitive industry where miners are competing to be the first to add blocks. Data by YCharts Worst, troubled miners have been selling their bitcoin reserves to make up for revenue shortfalls thereby causing supply to outstrip demand which is one of the reasons why digital assets declined by about 4% in HIVE's fiscal first quarter of 2025 (FQ1-2025) which ended in June, compared to a 54% surge in FQ4-2024 lasting from January to March. This means that if HIVE does not dispose of more of its HODLed coins, it should suffer from a QoQ decrease in revenues in FQ1-2025. As a result, it could miss revenue expectations when financial results are announced around August 12. looking at the second half of the year, the overall hashrate or total computing power of the Bitcoin network has gone slightly down from its April peak as per the chart below, indicating a decrease in mining activity. Data by YCharts Now, this could be an indication of miners' capitulation or not participating in the mining process to a point where there starts to be a reduction in supply, which would, in turn, mean higher prices as long as demand is sustained. In this connection, according to the blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant , there are signs of capitulation based on a 7.7% drop in the hash rate. However, the latest 10% surge in the price of Bitcoin during the last five days could be related to two other events. One is the shooting of President Trump as he has expressed support for the cryptocurrency. Second, the U.S. Central Bank has recently shown more signs that it will likely turn dovish as to monetary policy in September after weaker inflation numbers, which augurs well for miners envisaging tapping the debt markets. As a result, HIVE also saw its stock surge to $4.05 but, at the time of writing had retrenched to about $4.01, and it could fall further if there are no clear signals of a sustained reduction in crypto supply. Also, bearing in mind, that a potential Republican administration could impose a 60% to 100% tariff on goods imported from China where the Antminer's supplier Bitmain is headquartered , miners could have to spend more capex for efficiency-led equipment renewals. To provide a rough estimate of the effect of these tariffs, if 60% were applied to the capital expenses of $80 million for FY-2024, this would amount to $128 million, or more than the annual revenues . Furthermore, as shown below, continuously upgrading mining rigs to become more efficient has also resulted in a surge in depreciation costs which in turn impacts profitability, which means that any additional cost element can force the miner to sell more coins to generate sufficient revenues to support investments. Data by YCharts In these circumstances, one should expect volatility over the next few months. To further justify my cautious outlook, the company is trading at a forward P/S of 4.56x compared to 3.06x in December last year (chart below), or an increase of nearly 50% while its price has appreciated by only 2%, implying investors are highly optimistic about the future revenue growth. This is not aligned with analysts' revenue consensus estimates for FQ1-2025 of $24.32 million which would represent only 3.18% YoY growth. Worst, for FY-2025, the estimated $104.6 million would represent an 8.6% YoY decline. Data by YCharts However, I am optimistic over the long term. Long-term Potential as an Efficient Miner Diversifying into HPC The reason is going purely by the sales metric would ignore the value of the miner’s treasury of 2,503 coins which is worth $162.7 million based on a BTC valued at $65K. Assuming that it just unloads $20 million worth of its HODLed BTCs, this could increase the above revenue estimate to $124.6 million. Compared to the $114.5 million obtained in FY-2024, this would represent an 8.9% YoY growth. Moreover, the company’s diversification strategy into HPC, initially by using some of its existing A40 GPUs which were initially used for Ethereum mining, and then through the purchasing of newer H100s from Nvidia, is working. Hence, from only generating $229K of trial run-related revenues in the fourth quarter of last year as shown in the table below, this figure has been multiplied by over six times in FQ4-2024 to $1.81 million. This still represents a fraction of crypto sales but HPC's advantage is that it is in high demand thereby representing higher margins than crypto. To this end, HIVE aims to attain over $100 million in revenue with very high operating margins. SEC Filing (seekingalpha.com) In conclusion, this thesis has shown that HIVE's mining operations have been resilient to the halving event. Also, with Bitcoin's network hashrate no longer at its April peak, mining difficulty has declined slightly by 9.7% but is still up by more than 50% from one year ago. Learning from May 2020 Bitcoin halving, it was not until difficulty dropped by around 14% that there was an upside in BTC's value as shown below. Data by YCharts This is not the case today, and, on the contrary, there are now election-related volatility risks. To be fair, with the elections still about four months away, there is no certainty that President Trump will win a second term and Democrats could retain the White House. Still, risk-averse investors would want to avoid investing in such an environment of uncertainty and prefer to wait for more clarity on foreign trade policy. Finally, for shareholders, with its HODLed coins comfortably exceeding the debt of $30.6 million , and its diversification into HPC translating into more sales in a high-demand marketplace, HIVE should play an important role as a hosting service provider for AI workloads from next year.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4704778-hive-digital-resilient-miner-but-expect-short-term-volatility?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31163193.jpeg

When we pivoted towards iGaming so significantly in early 2023, reaching 500 reviews seemed like such a distant goal that it wasn’t really considered. But here we are, and we’ve got 1000 in our sights for year-end 2025.” While the company aims to put out a minimum of 10 new bitcoin and crypto casinos a month, pace does drop in summer as the industry slows down somewhat. This is when the team focuses on other areas of the space, enlightening their readers in regards to payments, developers, and games. “Covering all Bases, All of the Time” Crypto Lists aims not only to expand its database of crypto casino reviews overall but also focusing on the various niches within the space. New bitcoin casinos, established ones, and ones that are explicit about cutting out middlemen and enabling direct ‘wallet to wallet’ transfers between the casino and player. Perhaps the largest niche after the newest ones are no-KYC sites, sometimes referred to as anonymous crypto casinos, where players can sign up, deposit, and withdraw without submitting personal information or scanned documentation. Markus Jalmerot, Co-founder of Crypto Lists, explains their approach: “We’re all about covering all bases all of the time. It’s not a holistic experience for our readers if we neglect particular types of crypto casinos.” He concludes: “Some of our readers prefer regulated sites as that’s what they’re used to, so we make sure to review many sites that come with licenses and KYC protocols. However, a growing number of crypto casino players are looking for sites that more strongly embrace the somewhat libertarian Web3 ethos and don’t require any personal details. Likewise, we need to cater to those players too, which we have done over the course of these 500 reviews.” About Crypto Lists CryptoLists.com – trading as part of Short Selling SL – is a leading review site that covers crypto projects, casinos accepting deposits with cryptocurrencies, and important industry events in this space. Established at the end of 2021, Crypto Lists is committed to providing comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date information, empowering readers to make smarter decisions in the fast-paced worlds of Web3 and iGaming.

Ether's price surged more than 10% this past week to its highest level in over 3 weeks. ETH is currently up ~46% year-to-date. XRP is currently down ~8% year-to-date. This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know. We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Bitcoin's price climbed back above $65,000 this week for the first time in almost a month. BTC is currently up ~47% year-to-date. Ether Ether ( ETH-USD ) is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article, with its launch in July 2015. Ether's price surged more than 10% this past week to its highest level in over 3 weeks. ETH is currently up ~46% year-to-date. XRP XRP (XRP-USD), which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We've included it in this article for reference. XRP is currently down ~8% year-to-date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies. On January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch . Other ETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), and Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH ) .

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin {{BTC}} struggled to stay above $65,000, after falling below $64,000 during Wednesday's American trading hours. After briefly retaking $65,000, BTC drifted toward the $64,500 mark, down around 1% on 24 hours ago. The CoinDesk 20 Index is about 2.4% lower. The halt in Wednesday's rally followed an equity market sell-off, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index dropping 2.7% and the S&P 500 falling 1.3%. Joel Kruger, a market strategist at LMAX Group, said that the crypto rally might stall if the stock market sell-off turns into a correction, but over a longer time frame may provide a haven for investors fleeing stocks.  The chances of President Joe Biden dropping out of November's election hit 68% on crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket. Biden announced he had been diagnosed with Covid-19 on Wednesday, having previously said he would re-evaluate whether to run ""if [he] had some medical condition."" The president has thus far given a poor showing during the campaign, most notably during a debate with Donald Trump, who is considered the significantly more pro-crypto candidate. Trump's perceived chances of victory have become a metric for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin's rally to over $65,000 this week followed the assassination attempt on Trump, which was seen as a boost to his prospects of retaking the White House.  Several cryptocurrencies experienced significant losses after a malicious attack on Indian crypto exchange WazirX. The platform's native token WRX traded 15% lower at just over 14 cents while meme coin shiba inu (SHIB) slumped nearly 10%. The WazirX attacker walked away with more than $230 million in customer funds, including $100 million in SHIB and $52 million of ETH. Other tokens have been relatively stable in dollar terms while suffering significant losses in Indian rupee-denominated pairs. The bitcoin-rupee pair declined by 11% to 5.1 million rupees ($60,945), a massive discount to rival exchange CoinDCX. Meanwhile, the USDT-INR pair on WazirX has slipped by 8%.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows CME's share in global notional open interest in the standard futures market tied to bitcoin and ether.  The global derivatives giant accounts for 83% of total BTC futures open interest and 65% of ETH open interest.  The numbers represent growing institutional participation in the crypto market.

31160531,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630362,1721304022,"XRP Price Plummets To $0.5724, Can Bulls Maintain Support?","In recent trading activities, XRP has experienced a significant retracement, dipping toward a critical support level of $0.5724. This retracement which is seen as a correctional movement to the crypto asset’s recent rally has caught the attention of traders and investors alike thereby raising speculations as to whether the bulls can maintain the $0.5724 support level. This article provides an in-depth examination of the significance of the $0.5724 support level with the help of technical indicators and the potential future scenarios that could unfold when the coin reaches the level. XRP’s price was trading at around $0.5816 and was down by 3.89% with a market capitalization of over $32.5 billion and a trading volume of over $3.8 billion as of the time of writing. There has been a decrease of 3.70% in XRP’s market capitalization and a 17.22% increase in its trading volume, in the last 24 hours. Market Overview: Understanding The Recent Price Movement Of XRP On the 4-hour chart, XRP is still trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) but is currently on a bearish trajectory toward the $0.5724 support level. It is important to note that XRP had previously broken above $0.5724, which acted as a resistance level, and is now retracing for a retest. The 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator confirms XRP’s recent price retracement, as the signal line has crossed below the SMA of the indicator, with both indicators currently attempting to move out of the overbought zone. On the 1-day chart, XRP is making a bearish move toward the $0.5724 support level and the 100-day SMA. Despite this downward movement, the broader trend remains bullish, suggesting this could be a short-term retracement. Finally, it can be observed that the signal line has crossed above the SMA of the indicator and moved out of the overbought zone, with both lines attempting to reach the zero line. This formation of the composite trend oscillator suggests that the long-term outlook remains bullish despite the current drop in XRP’s price. The Significance Of The $0.5724 Support Level The $0.5725 support level holds significant importance in the future potential price movement of XRP. Thus, should the price of XRP decline to the support level and encounter rejection, it would likely start an upward movement toward the $0.6697 resistance mark. A successful breach above this target could serve as a catalyst, potentially triggering further upward movement to test the $0.7342 resistance and beyond. Nevertheless, should XRP’s price approach the $0.5725 support level and break below it, it may likely continue to move downward toward the $0.4663 support level. A further break below the $0.4663 support range could lead to a price drop toward the $0.4088 support level and other lower levels.

Allium Labs along with Visa also released its latest findings on stablecoin activity showing that demand for stablecoins has picked back up in 2024.  Data platform Allium Labs, which provides enterprise-grade blockchain data to companies like Visa, Stripe and Uniswap Foundation, has raised $16.5 million in a Series A funding round, it announced Thursday.  The funding round was led by venture capital firm Theory Ventures whose founder Tomasz Tunguz will join the board as part of the investment. Tunguz said “The demand for cryptocurrencies and tokens has just started"" and that Allium will provide the data to ""foster broader adoption.""  Seed investors Kleiner Perkins and Amplify Partners also participated. Allium Labs has now raised a total of $21.5 million which it plans to invest in data infrastructure and its go-to-market motion to offer services that will allow financial institutions to embrace digital assets, the company said.  “Currently, something as essential as accurately tracking digital currency volumes requires continually normalizing data across 40+ blockchain networks and parsing thousands of smart contracts, equating to petabytes of data,"" said Ethan Chan, CEO and Co-Founder of Allium. ""Our goal is that our customers never need to worry about any of this.""  Allium Labs has previously partnered with Visa to create the Visa OnChain Analytics Dashboard, which currently focuses on providing clear insights into stablecoin activity. Their latest findings released on Wednesday found two major trends; demand for stablecoins has picked back up in 2024, with circulating supply approaching $150 billion; and there's a steady growth of monthly active stablecoin users, with 27.5 million monthly active users across all chains.  Another finding revealed an improvement in the discrepancy between total transfer volume and bot-adjusted transfer volume. Their report from May 2024 said that of about $2.2 trillion in total transactions in April, just $149 billion originated from “organic payments activity."" Wednesday's findings showed that of about $2.65 trillion of the transfer volume from the last 30 days as much as $265 billion was ""organic.""  “The Visa OnChain Analytics Dashboard is designed to enable our clients to better understand this activity, and we look forward to continuing to iterate on our dashboard and metrics with partners like Allium to help our clients as they explore use cases and opportunities for stablecoins in the payment ecosystem,"" said Cuy Sheffield, Head of Visa Crypto.

The $50,600 level is crucial as it is the log 50% retrace of wave three, and a break could lead to increased choppiness in the market. Bitcoin has shown a surprising reversal, potentially heading towards $88K, but caution is advised until a confirmed setup is in place. In June, Seeking Alpha’s podcast host, Rena Sherbill, had me on to discuss the ongoing crypto bull market. In that episode, I discussed the importance of the $50,600 support for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Ideally, it holds. Structurally, it has a good chance of holding. And, although there are no guarantees in trading and investing, we have reached a good point in Bitcoin’s structure to take a low-risk trade. Frustrating the Bulls In late March, Bitcoin dropped into a corrective pattern from its all-time high of $73K+. That drop commenced a frustrating four-month slog of sideways action. As is typical during such periods, crypto podcasts flashed titles asking whether this bullish cycle was over. Yet, such periods are a key part of bull markets. And the correction that started in March is still shy of the five-month sideways correction Bitcoin went through from April to September 2023. That correction preceded the vertical move that broke Bitcoin’s all-time high set in 2021. This correction is unlikely to precede the same return on a percentile basis, but as long as it is over $50,600, I expect new all-time highs in the coming months, likely before the year’s end. Why $50,600? Why is the level $50,600 so important? That level is the log 50% retrace of wave three that peaked in March at ~$73K. The fourth wave of impulsive rallies holds the 50% retrace of its third wave, and more often holds the 38.6% retrace. The 38.6% retrace in Bitcoin is $55,300 and has already been breached, so $50,600 is the next level to watch. It is not as though a break of $50,600 commences a bear market, though it might. At the very least, it would increase the choppiness of this bull market and open the door to a much longer correction. And for practical and tactical purposes, it would lead me to sell all my more speculative altcoin positions and cut my Bitcoin exposure down. So far, that is not a concern. However, I always consider the most adverse scenarios. Bitcoin, daily chart (MotiveWave software) A Surprising Reversal I intended to publish this article last week, but I was not able to finish it before a planned weekend away demanded my preparation. When I came back on Sunday night, my jaw dropped as I noted Bitcoin made a push through resistance. And as of the time of writing, it has stretched well past a normal wave four, as indicated by my label of black circle-4. This C wave of this wave-4 was already evident as a diagonal when it was dropping below $60K. That means this wave four is not invalid until it breaks circle-2 $72K. That said, this wave four has breached norms, and I now presume the bottom is in and Bitcoin is headed to my next target of $88K, with the slim possibility of extension to $97K. However, Elliotticians look for five waves through resistance off a low to confirm that a correction has ended. Resistance was at $62K and so has fallen. However, this move is still three waves in structure. As of writing, the third wave has hit $64,800. This rally also has a corrective structure indicating that if this reversal is indicative that the bottom is in, it is a diagonal. Ideally, the fourth wave holds the channel as drawn, which is currently in the $60,100 region. This diagonal invalidates with a break below $54K. Bitcoin, two hour chart (MotiveWave software) Sound Tactics How do we trade such action as we wait for Bitcoin to confirm a bottom? While we wait for the perfect pattern, the market can get away from us. However, if we trade before confirmation, we can experience a drop to $50,600 (roughly 20%) before stopping out or cutting our position. First, this is not meant to be construed as personal advice. It is meant to help you consider ways of managing this action. As I always say with such questions, “It depends on what you start with.” If you still have not participated in this bull market, you might consider what amount of Bitcoin you are comfortable owning whether or not it broke $50,600, and that you would add to if a bear market like that of 2018 and 2022 started. I still have Bitcoin in my possession that I bought in the $3000 region at the 2018 low and then held through the 2022 bull. Those tranches of Bitcoin were not part of my swing portfolio. What has stopped you from holding some Bitcoin long term and slowly accumulating in bear markets? If you are more interested in developing a swing position, this is not the type of rally to chase, unless you keep the size comfortable for a stop loss at $50,600. However, if Bitcoin forms a clear five waves as shown in red, that could complete black circle-i early. Black circle-ii is a great place to add. The stop for that trade moves up to $53,600. And circle-ii often breaks quite deep, up to a 764% retrace of circle-i. Until circle-i completes, I can’t be specific about levels for circle-ii. However, we may be able to make additional purchases in the $56K–$58K region. Conclusion Bitcoin has gone sideways for four months, causing many to wonder if the bull market is over. While no one can predict the future, so far, this action is a run-of-the-mill bullish consolidation that provides the launch pad for Bitcoin’s next move higher. While positioning after this correction requires care and patience, we are starting to come into a zone where risk to reward is more advantageous than it has been since the September 2023 bottom. Lastly, I will remind you that I don’t have a crystal ball. My levels do break at times. However, the proper use of these levels involves not considering them predictive. They are tactical levels from which to measure your risk and resize your position accordingly. Therefore, mark my words. If by chance $50,600 breaks, it will change my view and derisk my own portfolio. That is necessary with such a volatile asset class.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4704566-bitcoin-is-in-the-buy-zone-technical-analysis-btcusd-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31160651.jpeg

Renowned crypto analyst JD has lately revealed his very positive view of DOGE, which has excited traders and investors. Related Reading: Expert Foresees XRP Soaring To $250: Technical Analysis Explained Driven by what he labels as one of the most “beautiful charts” he has seen in his long trading history, JD claimed in a series of perceptive pieces on X that Dogecoin is about to experience a significant price spike. Even with the latest market downturn when DOGE dropped by 40% from its local high, JD remained unflinching in his positive view. He thinks that this dip prepares the ground for a strong comeback. “DOGE is gearing up for something BIG,” JD said, implying the possibility for a significant price movement not too distant. #Dogecoin – One of the most beautiful chart structures I’ve seen! Dumb Money who got REKT will deny! 🤣😂 Glad we called the 45% crash from Local top posted on Patreon/Discord! 🎯🎯 MAJORITY of my orders have been filled! #DOGE is getting ready for something BIG! 💪🙏 $DOGE… pic.twitter.com/OodL39WjDR — JD 🇵🇭 (@jaydee_757) July 16, 2024 Risk Control And Strategic Positioning JD’s approach is to leverage Dogecoin’s present price motion by using DOGE’s consistent range and the development of additional support levels. This method shows his faith in the approaching upward trend. “I’m betting,” JD said, stressing his expectation of a big upward increase. To further reduce any danger, JD has also wisely set stop-loss orders at lower levels. This double approach of controlling downside risk and protecting positions shows a careful and balanced trading technique. “It’s about being ready for both eventualities,” he said, stressing his measured approach based on experience. Investor Perspective And Market Dynamics The audacious forecasts of the market sentinel have spurred debate and excitement among the crypto community as well as criticism. Many investors who had earlier taken a cautious posture or sustained losses during the last weak market are now reevaluating their opinions on DOGE. Many have responded positively to JD’s comments on the strategic placement of orders and the clarity of Dogecoin’s chart structure, therefore providing a lighthouse of hope among the volatility of the market. The analysis also highlights a contradicting forecast that clouds JD’s hope. Based on present projections, the price of Dogecoin might drop by 14.14%, coming to $0.105562 on August 17, 2024. Technical data showing a neutral mood and a Fear & Greed Index value of 61 (Greed) reinforce this cautions viewpoint by implying a balance of optimism and caution. Related Reading: $174 In Sight: Analyst Projects Major Surge For Solana (SOL) Dogecoin: Trading Volume And Market Possibility Though opinions are divided, the trading volume of Dogecoin is strong. Figures remain significant relative to recent volumes even if it has somewhat dropped from $1.1 billion to $850 million, suggesting continuous interest in the meme coin. Furthermore showing the great and increasing involvement in the community, the number of Dogecoin wallet addresses has grown to an amazing 90 million. Given the indications of possible recovery in the later half of the year for the bitcoin market, there is increasing expectation that DOGE would appreciate noticeably. Should the wider market recover, Dogecoin would very likely ride the wave of restored investor confidence, resulting in significant price increases in the next weeks and months.

SHIB has lost 6% since the attacker drained $100 million worth of the token from the Indian exchange.  Most coins, including market leader bitcoin and tether, are trading at a significant discount on WazirX.  Cryptocurrencies stolen in a malicious attack at Indian exchange WazirX early Thursday, as well as the platform's native token, are experiencing significant losses in their market values after the hack drained roughly 50% of the exchange's reserves.  The exchange has temporarily paused withdrawals.  WazirX's WRX token is trading 15% lower at just over 14 cents, according to Coingecko data. The rupee-denominated price has slumped more than 25% since the exchange confirmed the hack that saw the attacker walk away with $230 million in customer funds, including $100 million in shiba inu {{SHIB}}. The attacker also drained $52 million in ether {{ETH}}, $11 million in MATIC and $6 million in PEPE.  Since then, SHIB has lost over 6% in market value in U.S. dollar terms while trading 16% lower in rupee terms amid reports the hacker is liquidating the coins. Blockchain data suggests the attacker is offloading SHIB, putting downward pressure on its market value.  Other tokens have held relatively steady in dollar terms while suffering significant losses in the exchange's INR pairs.  Notably, the bitcoin-rupee (BTC/INR) pair has declined by 11% to 5.1 million rupees ($60,945), trading at a massive discount to prices on rival exchange CoinDCX, where the cryptocurrency changed hands at 5.7 million rupees. BTC's global average dollar-denominated price traded 1% higher on the day at $61,800. The largest cryptocurrency by market value is priced around $64,900 according to CoinDesk Indices data.

31154397,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630345,1721293228,"Bitcoin Price Set To Skyrocket To $750,000, Says Expert","In a forecast shared via a YouTube video, Joe Burnett, Senior Product Marketing Manager at Unchained Capital, articulates a strong case for Bitcoin reaching a valuation of $750,000. According to Burnett, the market may be substantially underestimating Bitcoin’s potential this cycle, often losing sight of its broader context within the global financial ecosystem. Why Bitcoin Could Soar To $750,000 Burnett begins by addressing a common oversight in market analysis, which typically juxtaposes Bitcoin’s current cycle against historical performances without accounting for its evolving market context. “I think it’s possible that many people are underestimating Bitcoin this cycle,” Burnett stated, emphasizing the necessity to perceive Bitcoin through the lens of its relative position in the total global wealth. A key component of Burnett’s argument is the HODL model created by the Rational Root, which he discussed extensively on the podcast “What Bitcoin Did.” The model pinpoints a critical inflection in 2020, coinciding with Bitcoin’s third halving—an event that reduces the number of new bitcoins generated and thus awarded to miners for verifying transactions. Related Reading: Watch Out Bears: Bitcoin’s Rally To This Mark Could Trigger $19 Billion Short Squeeze Burnett elucidates, “This model is fascinating because it shows a logical inflection point that occurred in 2020 around the third halving. It highlights that illiquid supply as a percentage of total supply held at an all-time low percentage, and it’s been slowly climbing ever since.” According to him, this reflects a shift towards Bitcoin being increasingly held by long-term holders rather than circulated by miners and speculators. Post-2020, Burnett argues, Bitcoin has entered a new phase characterized by a diminishing supply of liquid coins. “Until the third halving, Bitcoin was really just in the process of distributing coins via proof of work mining; almost 90% of all coins were mined by 2020,” he explains. The subsequent reduction in new coin generation post-halving has spurred a gradual transition from a freely circulating supply to a more tightly held asset. Burnett’s forecast also leverages a comparative analysis with gold, traditionally viewed as a robust store of value. He challenges this notion by highlighting the flaws in gold’s economic mechanics, particularly its annual supply increase of 1% to 2% which introduces continuous sell pressure. “Gold has a negative feedback loop considering it’s not perfectly scarce like Bitcoin. Hundreds of billions of dollars of new gold are mined annually,” Burnett points out, arguing that this diminishes gold’s appeal as an investment. Related Reading: Silicon Valley Using Trump For A Bitcoin Pump Play? Mark Cuban Weighs In Conversely, he describes Bitcoin’s halving events as a “positive feedback loop,” where the decrease in new supply every four years inherently drives price appreciation, stimulating new waves of adoption. “The amount of new Bitcoin being mined gets cut in half. This repeats until no newly released Bitcoin are mined,” he adds, suggesting a built-in scarcity that bolsters its value over time. Zooming out to a global scale, Burnett references the near quadrillion-dollar total global wealth, within which Bitcoin’s current market cap is just a fraction. He contends that Bitcoin’s market share is poised for significant expansion, potentially commanding a sizable portion of global wealth. This stands in sharp contrast to more conservative expectations by various experts which barely see Bitcoin crossing the $100,000 threshold in the near future. “With all that being said, the ‘concept of diminishing returns’ could very easily be flawed. We live in a world with nearly 1 quadrillion dollars of total global wealth and Bitcoin is 0.1% of that,” Burnett states. He concludes with a quote from Michael Saylor: “All your models will be broken,” and added “anything below the size of gold is absurdly early. Gold parity is now at about $750,000 per Bitcoin, meaning if the market size of Bitcoin just reached the market size of gold.” At press time, BTC traded at $ Featured image created with DALL·E, chart from TradingView.com",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-skyrocket-to-750000-expert/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

A recent Covid diagnosis and a statement from Biden that he'd withdraw if he came down with a medical condition appear to be moving the market.  The chances of President Joe Biden withdrawing from the race for U.S. president hit 68%, challenging an all-time high of 70%, after he said he had been diagnosed with Covid-19, according to bets placed on the crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket.  In an interview with BET News that aired yesterday, Biden said that he would consider dropping out should he be diagnosed with a medical condition.  “Is there anything that you would look to you, personally and to say, ‘If I see that, I will reevaluate?’” BET's Ed Gordon asked Biden.  “If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if doctors came to me and said, ‘You got this problem, that problem,’” Biden said.  The odds of Biden dropping out first surged following a debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump, jumping to 70% from 36% beforehand as his performance was widely criticized by stakeholders and the press.  Biden acknowledged the poor performance, blaming jet lag and an intense travel schedule.  After a PR campaign stressing his candidacy and denials from possible replacements, the ""Yes"" side of the drop-out contract slid 34 percentage points back to 36%.  And then the cycle repeated.  A public call-out from long-time Democratic supporter George Clooney for Biden to step down rocketed the ""Yes"" side of the contract up to 66% for a short while before it returned to the 30s. It rebounded again during the Republican National Convention and a market-favorite running mate pick from Trump's camp. The Covid diagnosis boosted it further.  Meanwhile, the chances that Biden will drop out before the Democratic convention confirms his nomination in August are also on their way back up, now at 59%.  Polymarket's national election tracker puts Trump at 64% to Biden's 12%. Kamala Harris, Biden's running mate, is at 19%.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/18/biden-dropout-chances-rise-to-68-after-covid-diagnosis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01f2c833c9cac37b2b4979e0bd3f2669553e0e0c-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31152306,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630278,1721289631,"Behind Bitcoin’s Surge Above $64,000: Here Are The Key Drivers of the Current Rally","Bitcoin price has rallied above the $64,000 mark. Glassnode, a market intelligence platform, has analyzed this notable increase, which attributes the current price movement to a significant easing of sell-side pressure, particularly from the German government. Exhaustion of Sell-Side Pressure According to the on-chain data provided by Glassnode, the recent uptick in Bitcoin’s price is largely due to what they describe as the “complete exhaustion” of sell-side forces, particularly those stemming from the recent governmental actions. Over the past weeks, the German government has been a big seller, selling off tonnes of Bitcoin, leading to an earlier price decrease at below $54,000. Related Reading: Institutions Grab Over $5 Billion Bitcoin in a Week: Are They Predicting a Mega Rally? Nevertheless, despite these sales, the market has not moved lower than that mark, suggesting that this selling was anticipated and factored into prices by the markets. Glassnode’s report highlights that from July 7 to July 10, approximately 39,800 BTC flowed out of labeled wallets, marking a critical phase of market absorption. Also contributing to the price surge, as highlighted by Glassnode are inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have garnered renewed investor attention in recent weeks. Over the last week, ETFs have reported over $1 billion in inflows, suggesting a renewed confidence in Bitcoin among institutional investors. Glassnode noted in the report: As prices sold off towards the $54k low, they dropped below the average inflow cost basis of ETF holders, which is currently at $58.2k. In response, the ETFs have seen their first significant tranche of positive interest since early June, with over $1B in total inflows last week alone. Furthermore, the decline in exchange flows – deposits and withdrawals – remains a significant sign of waning sell-side pressure. Lower exchange flows generally indicate reduced market liquidity and selling, which can provide price support or an upward momentum. Current exchange volumes have cooled off at about $1.5 billion daily, unlike the higher marks seen in March.

The migration comes as a part of Polygon’s planned revamp laid out last year in its “Polygon 2.0” roadmap. The change was initially proposed in July 2023 to its community, and would make POL the main token for all Polygon networks.  The switch will consist of a technical upgrade that enables POL to be the native gas and staking token for Polygon’s main proof-of-stake chain (Polygon PoS). In the next stages of the upgrade, POL will begin to also secure other blockchains in Polygon’s wider “aggregated” network, including the AggLayer.  “POL is a hyperproductive token that can be used to provide valuable services to any chain in the Polygon network, including the AggLayer itself,” Polygon wrote in their blog post.  According to the Polygon team, MATIC holders on the Polygon PoS chain won’t have to do anything for this upgrade and their tokens will show up in POL.  For those using MATIC on Polygon’s zkEVM rollup, on centralized exchanges, or on the Ethereum blockchain, they will need to go through various steps, Polygon detailed in their blog post.  As part of the network’s migration, Polygon will tested the token upgrade on July 17 in a test network environment, in order to identify or fix any issues before POL is live on mainnet.

Over the weekend, the AI token saw a nearly 40% recovery and seems to be preparing for a breakout. Market watchers have predicted short and long-term targets for the token after the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) token merger. Related Reading: Whale Makes $8 Million With Trump-Inspired Memecoin As PolitiFi Tokens Soar FET Drops 23% Amid Market Retrace This month, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance kicked off phase 1 of the ASI token merger process. The process began with rebranding Fetch.AI’s name and logo to the Alliance’s. Additionally, FET updated its supply and market capitalization but momentarily kept its ticker. Phase 1 began with delisting Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) and SingularityNET (AGIX) from crypto trading platforms. However, several exchanges, including Kraken and Coinbase, announced they would not support the migration process. Following the rebrand, FET’s price dropped by nearly 10% despite flipping other AI tokens like Render (RNDR) and becoming the 27th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. At the time, the token lost the $1.4 support zone and fell to the $1.2 price range before reclaiming the $1.3 mark. The broader market retrace dragged FET’s price below $1.1, a level not seen since late February. This performance represented a 26% decline from its Q3 opening price of $1.45. ASI Token Merger Update Next Week As the market recovered from the July retrace, FET surged 38.7% over the weekend. The AI token rose from the $1.11 price level and reclaimed the $1.4 support zone on Monday. Some market watchers highlighted FET’s steady recovery, suggesting that the token maintained a bullish pattern and seemed poised to make a 3X performance. On Thursday, World of Charts pointed out FET’s recent price action. To the analyst, the token is breaking out of a falling wedge pattern and expects a “massive bullish wave” towards $5 in the following days. Crypto analyst Posty shared a similar opinion with his X followers. In the post, Posty claimed that the AI token is “looking much better here” and it’s potentially about to break out of the falling wedge pattern. However, he stated that reclaiming the $1.75 resistance level is key for a further uptick. Similarly, another analyst believes closing above the $1.7 mark will propel the price to a new all-time high (ATH). Per the post, breaking out of the three-month downtrend line could make FET soar to $13 after the ASI token merger. The ASI alliance announced it will host an X Space session on July 22 with Fetch.ai’s CEO and ASI’s chairman, Humayun Sheikh, to discuss the latest updates. The crypto community received the news positively, expressing excitement about ASI’s token merger Phase 2. This phase includes the launch of ASI and migrating FET tokens to new tokens.

31148901,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630268,1721282445,Watch Out Bears: Bitcoin’s Rally To This Mark Could Trigger $19 Billion Short Squeeze,"Over the past few days, Bitcoin has seen quite a notable rebound in its price, rising from as low as the $53,000 level last week to trading as high as above $66,000 in the early hours of Wednesday before now retracing to a current trading price of $64,433. This bullish price performance has been the downfall of approximately 50,436 traders in the crypto market today. Particularly, according to data from Coinglass, this number of traders has seen massive liquidations, bringing the current total liquidations to $145.58 million. Bitcoin traders felt the brunt of this total liquidation, seeing roughly $46.22 million shared evenly between short and long positions, indicating the asset’s mixed trajectory in the past day alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates as Crypto Funds Attract $1.44 Billion in Fresh Capital, Rally To Begin? Bitcoin: Bigger Liquidations Incoming While recent trading activities have triggered millions of dollars in liquidations, further data shows that this scenario could escalate dramatically, turning into billions if Bitcoin continues its ascent towards record highs, breaching a notable mark. Particularly, as reported by MartyParty, a prominent crypto enthusiast in the community, should Bitcoin’s price hit $72,400, the market would feel the impact, with nearly $19 billion in Bitcoin short positions poised for liquidation at this price point. Marty Party reported this on Elon Musk’s social media platform X, citing data from Coinglass. Concluding this disclosure, the crypto enthusiast noted: “Never bet against technology.” How Long For This Liquidation To Occur? While the $72,400 price mark might seem like a long stretch from the current market price, BTC might not take that long to get to this mark, given the current fundamentals. For instance, the market might be drawn quicker to this mark as this is where the liquidity lies to fuel its current trend. Aside from that, no bears are in sight to slow the asset’s rally from getting there in the short term. First of all, the German government has sold off all of its BTC holdings of roughly 49,858 BTC with a current balance below $500, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. Notably, the current balance of approximately $427 worth of BTC is the cumulative sats (small units of BTC) donated from different wallet addresses. Furthermore, according to recent data from CryptoQuant, 36% of Mt. Gox BTC has been distributed to creditors. However, despite this distribution, BTC’s price is yet to see any notable correction, which suggests two things: that the creditors are not selling, and even if they are, the Bitcoin market is absorbing it real quickly as evident in the slight stabilization of BTC’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price On The Rise: Is The $70K Mark Within Reach? These major sell-offs by the German government and Mt.

XRP Sharks & Whales Now Carry Over 85% Of The Entire Supply According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, large XRP investors have been participating in buying for a while now. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” which keeps track of the total amount of supply that a particular wallet group is currently holding. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: NVT Golden Cross Suggests BTC Oversold The addresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of tokens they carry in their balance. For instance, the 1 to 10 coins group includes all holders who own between 1 and 10 XRP. In the context of the current topic, the combined group of sharks and whales is of interest. The sharks and whales are the two largest cohorts in the sector, so their behavior can be worth keeping an eye on, as it may cause ripples in the market. Naturally, the whales are the more influential of the two groups. Santiment defines the lower bound for the combined sharks and whales group as 100,000 tokens. At the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency, this is worth around $61,200. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP Supply Distribution for these sharks and whales over the past few months: The above graph shows that the XRP sharks and whales have seen their supply rise over the last few months. These large investors now hold around 51.59 billion XRP, equivalent to around 85% of the entire circulating supply of the cryptocurrency. In terms of the pure balance, the supply of this combined cohort has managed to set a new all-time high (ATH) with the latest increase, while in terms of the percentage, the metric is sitting at an 11-month high. The accumulation from the sharks and whales has persisted in this period regardless of whether the cryptocurrency’s price has been rallying or plunging. This conviction from these key investors is naturally an optimistic sign for the asset. While the coin seems bullish in the long term due to this, another development can be a bearish predictor in the short term. As Santiment has pointed out in another X post, investors have shown hype toward XRP on social media. As the chart shows, the sentiment towards the asset has shot up into positive territory following its recovery rally. Historically, cryptocurrencies have tended to move opposite to the majority’s expectations, so this FOMO can end up as an obstacle to the surge.

According to the analyst, Shiba Inu is set for a massive 450% rally to reach new All-Time Highs (ATH). Shiba Inu Aims For 450% Surge To New Highs In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst, Javon Marks expressed bullish optimism about Shiba Inu’s future price outlook. The analyst has forecasted that Shiba Inu is preparing for a 450% surge to new all-time highs this bullish season. Related Reading: Bullish Return: Institutional Investors Pour $1.44 Billion Into Crypto In One Week Highlighting SHIB’s past performances, Marks revealed that Shiba Inu has shown incredible progress after breaking out of similar patterns observed in the previous bull run. At the time, the popular meme coin surged as high as 400%, moving from approximately $0.000009079 to $0.00004559. The crypto analyst predicts that Shiba Inu could witness another substantial increase of around 351%, moving from this bullish area to break out of a new price target of $0.0000886. He indicated that this surge to $0.0000886 would represent a new all-time high for SHIB, surpassing its current ATH of $0.00008616, recorded in October 2021. Sharing a SHIB/USDT price chart depicting Shiba Inu’s historical price movements from 2021 to 2026, Marks suggested that the popular meme coin mimicking a pattern from the 2021 bull run, potentially signaling a massive increase of 930.20% that could propel the price of SHIB to $0.00008063. In a previous post, Marks also maintained his bullish optimism for Shiba Inu. He revealed that despite its sluggish performance recently, Shiba Inu’s 3D prices are holding on to this key pattern that could trigger another massive rally, potentially propelling the cryptocurrency up by 855% to new all-time highs. Looking ahead, Marks suggests that Shiba Inu’s bullish projection is further confirmed by the “Hidden Bullish Divergence” between the meme coin’s price and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The analyst asserts that this divergence validates the underlying strength behind SHIB’s price, indicating the continuation of its already impressive uptrend. SHIB Price Fundamentals Remain Strong In the past few weeks, Shiba Inu has witnessed a significant change in its price performance, shifting towards a more bullish position and indicating strong fundamentals. In June, Shiba Inu and various other meme coins witnessed an unexpected price crash, experiencing double-digit declines as the demand for meme coins in the market began to wane. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Telegram-Based Notcoin Is Ready To Fly, Here’s How High However, now, Shiba Inu is in an uptrend, recording a significant increase of approximately 16.46% in just one week.

In the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu has continued its upward trend, witnessing a 3.61% increase in its value, according to CoinMarketCap.

31142367,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630303,1721270842,Bitcoin Price Steadies: What Are the Chances of Another Rise?,"Bitcoin price struggled to extend gains above the $66,000 resistance level. BTC is consolidating and holding gains above the $63,500 zone. Bitcoin struggled to continue higher above the $66,000 resistance zone. The price is trading above $63,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $64,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up unless it breaks the $63,500 support zone. Bitcoin Price Holds Gains, Can It Rise Again? Bitcoin price remained in a bullish zone above the $63,500 and $63,800 resistance levels. BTC made another attempt to clear the $66,000 resistance zone. However, the bulls failed to extend gains and the price started a downside correction. There was a drop below the $65,000 and $64,500 levels. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $62,465 swing low to the $66,100 high. It found support near the $63,850 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $62,465 swing low to the $66,100 high. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $64,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading above $64,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $65,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $66,000 level. A clear move above the $66,000 resistance might spark another increase in the coming sessions. The next key resistance could be $66,500. The next major hurdle sits at $67,200. A close above the $67,200 resistance might push the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $68,000 resistance. More Downsides In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to climb above the $65,000 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $64,000 level and the trend line. The first major support is $63,850. The next support is now near $63,500. Any more losses might send the price toward the $62,500 support zone in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now near the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $64,000, followed by $63,500.

From the daily chart, ADA, the native currency, is up roughly 4% in the last day and 17% in the previous week, according to CoinMarketCap data. Analyst: Bulls To Lift ADA By 2X Even as ADA reverses recent losses, one analyst thinks more will come. In a post on X, the analyst said the coin is gearing up for more price gains that could see ADA more than 2X in the medium term. The bullish outlook is primarily technical, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. ADA has been nearly 40% since July 8, rising from below $0.35 to over $0.44 at press time. Related Reading: BNB Price Rally Imminent? Trendline Break Could Ignite Surge To $635 The surge also comes amid decent trading volume. Although prices have been moving sideways in the past few days, the uptrend is clear. At this pace, ADA bulls appear to be targeting $0.51, the immediate liquidation line, and May 2024 highs. Of note, the expansion of ADA prices from June and July 2024 pits meant the coin broke up from a bull flag. As the analyst observed, the surge above the descending wedge and multi-week resistance trend line was decisive on July 13. Most importantly, bulls have confirmed the leg up, backing optimistic buyers. The upswing is, however, expected. ADA is a leading altcoin, benefiting from the recovery of Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Beyond this, holders are backing on fundamental factors, especially the upcoming activation of the Chang hard fork in the next two weeks. Cardano Preparing For Chang Hard Fork And Voltaire Over the years, Cardano has been building. Every transition shift has benefited ADA prices and holders from Byron to Basho. Therefore, as the community prepares for the Chang hard fork, ADA prices seem to be expanding in tandem. The update will mark the beginning of the Voltaire era. At this phase, the aim is to decentralize governance, giving voting rights to ADA holders. To make this possible, Cardano developers are introducing Delegate Representatives who will facilitate decision-making. Furthermore, the goal will be to improve transaction processing speeds further and boost the network’s security. Related Reading: $50 Injection?

31137947,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630259,1721262654,"Bitwise CIO Bullish On Ethereum ETFs Fueling Surge To Record Highs Above $5,000","As the highly anticipated launch date of spot Ethereum ETFs approaches, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer of crypto asset manager Bitwise, has stressed the potential for these ETF inflows to drive the Ethereum price to record highs. In a recent client note, Hougan highlighted the significant impact that ETF flows could have on the Ethereum price, surpassing even the effects witnessed in the spot Bitcoin ETF market in the US. Ethereum ETFs Poised To Surpass Bitcoin’s Impact? Hougan confidently predicts that introducing spot Ethereum ETFs will lead to a surge in ETH’s value, possibly reaching all-time highs above $5,000. However, he cautions that the first few weeks after the ETF launch could be volatile, as funds could flow out of the existing $11 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) after it is converted to an ETF. This could be similar to the case of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw significant outflows of over $17 billion after the Bitcoin ETF market was approved in January, with the first inflows recorded 5 months later on May 3. Still, Hougan expects the market to stabilize in the long term, pushing Ethereum to record prices by the end of the year after the initial outflows subside, drawing a comparison with Bitcoin in key metrics to understand this thesis. Related Reading: ‘Most Bullish Setup Ever’: Crypto Analyst Lists 10 Reasons To Invest Now For example, Bitcoin ETFs have purchased more than twice the amount of Bitcoin compared to what miners have produced over the same period, contributing to a 25% increase in Bitcoin’s price since the ETF launch and a 110% increase since the market began pricing in the launch in October 2023. That said, Hougan believes the impact on Ethereum could be even more significant, and identifies three structural reasons why Ethereum’s ETF inflows could have a greater impact than Bitcoin’s. Lower Inflation, Staking Advantage, And Scarcity The first reason Bitwise’s CIO highlights is Ethereum’s lower short-term inflation rate. While Bitcoin’s inflation rate was 1.7% when Bitcoin ETFs launched, Ethereum’s inflation rate over the past year has been 0%. The second reason lies in the difference between Bitcoin miners and Ethereum stakers. Due to the expenses associated with mining, Bitcoin miners generally sell much of the Bitcoin they acquire to cover operational costs. In contrast, Ethereum relies on a proof-of-stake (PoS) system, where users stake ETH as collateral to process transactions accurately. ETH stakers, not burdened with high direct costs, are not compelled to sell the ETH they earn. Consequently, Hougan suggests that Ethereum’s daily forced selling pressure is lower than that of Bitcoin. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are On The Move Again – Here’s What They’re Doing This Time The third reason stems from the fact that a substantial portion of ETH is staked and, therefore, unavailable for sale. Currently, 28% of all ETH is staked, while 13% is locked in smart contracts, effectively removing it from the market. This results in approximately 40% of all ETH being unavailable for immediate sale, creating a considerable scarcity and ultimately favoring a potential increase in price for the second largest cryptocurrency on the market, depending on the outflows and inflows recorded. Hougan concluded: As I mentioned above, I expect the new Ethereum ETPs to be a success, gathering $15 billion in new assets over their first 18 months on the market… If the ETPs are as successful as I expect—and given the dynamics above—it’s hard to imagine ETH not challenging its old record. ETH was trading at $3,460, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours and nearly 12% in the past seven days.
