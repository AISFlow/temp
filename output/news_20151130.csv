In a post on his Facebook page obtained by CoinDesk, dogetipbot's Josh Mohland announced he will return the project to the bitcoin and dogecoin cryptocurrency communities, though the tone of his messages was at some times pointed when addressing its members.  Mohland wrote:  ""I'll be open-sourcing dogetipbot and giving a friendly 'peace out' to cryptocurrency in general. Friendly is a nice way to put it, I think.""  Founded in 2014, dogetipbot was one of a handful of digital currency micropayments startups to gain traction and investment alongside companies including ChangeTip and Zapchain, though it focused more on the alternative cryptocurrency dogecoin.  However, comments from Mohland indicate dogetipbot was unable to profit from its early product aimed at this use case, and that community support for the project may have been an issue.  In statements, Mohland called working with existing financial systems “more profitable and desirable” for users, adding that he believes the technology is a ""solution looking for a problem"".  ""Most of our users want USD at the end of the day and don't like PayPal. Bitcoin as a solution just didn't fit or make sense when we were building our banking relationships anyway,"" he told CoinDesk.  Mohland is currently working on another payments startup called HoneyLedger that similarly aims to empower online content creators. Despite the name, however, it is not a blockchain or distributed ledger project.  ""HoneyLedger is a 100% traditional fintech product – no blockchain tech in there at all,"" he said.  HoneyLedger has indicated it aims to launch APIs in the coming weeks.

42378433,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCdt,1448914510,Estonian High Court Asks Government to Clarify Bitcoin Stance,"The Estonian Supreme Court has asked the country’s central bank, two of its civil ministries and its top financial regulator to answers questions related to bitcoin as it considers a case on the legality of the digital currency.  The questions focus on the application of anti-money laundering (AML) statutes to bitcoin activities, as well as the broader nature of the financial technology, according to a translation of the court’s 19th November decision. Eesti Pank, the Interior and Finance Ministries, and the Estonian Financial Supervision Authority must respond to the court’s request by 11th January.  The developments follow a lawsuit filed last year by Otto de Voogd, operator of bitcoin trading platform BTC.ee, in the wake of law enforcement pressure. Trading was suspended on the platform in February 2014, a move then attributed to ""threats issued by the Estonian police"".  As reported by CoinDesk, officials from the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit of the Estonian Police and Border Guard Board had contacted de Voogd, telling him that he was required to provide information on BTC.ee users and attest to his compliance with national law. A representative for the Estonian Police later denied that de Voogd was threatened.  In a Facebook post over the weekend, de Voogd outlined the Supreme Court’s decision and said that the move will ""show the true face of the Estonian state when it comes to dealing with truly disruptive innovation that was not created by the state itself"".  De Voogd later told CoinDesk:  ""It will be interesting to see the answers of these state institutions to the Supreme Court, in particular if they hold on to the harsh and restrictive anti-bitcoin line of the Estonian police and Ministry of Finance.""  According to de Voogd, the case may ultimately be referred to the European Court of Justice, the same court that, after a months-long dispute that began in Sweden, ruled that bitcoin trades are exempt from value-added tax (VAT).

42378449,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCpD,1448889953,Bitcoin Exchange Trading Volumes Hit All-Time High,"Bitcoin exchange trading volumes have hit an all-time high even as the digital currency's price closes in on a 52-week peak.  According to Bitcoinity  , the busiest day for exchanges to date was recorded on 26th November, when some 2.86 million worth of bitcoin was traded across all exchanges indexed by the data provider.  Trading volumes have been setting records in recent weeks, with the previous peak occurring just four weeks ago, on 30th October, when 2.49 million bitcoins were traded.  As trading volumes have risen, so has the price. The price gained $25 or 7.6% in a days' trading, even as volume surged to its 26th November peak, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Similar volume growth accompanied price rallies at the end of October and early November.  Greater mainstream adoption?  Although the surge in volume took place on the eve of the major shopping event Black Friday – holding out the possibility of a link between greater consumer adoption of bitcoin and its price and volume spike – market-watchers CoinDesk spoke to believe the run-up has been driven by traders and exchanges themselves, not commercial activity.  ""Only a small percentage of exchange volume will be due to genuine bitcoin use or adoption,"" said Alistair Milne, who the runs Monaco-based Altana Digital Currency Fund.  As more exchanges introduce leveraged trading, the possibility of outsized movements in the bitcoin price grows. As borrowed funds come due, they can cause the price to jump or plunge while the borrowed sums are settled, Milne added.  ""But bitcoin traders, especially those using leverage, artificially amplify short term supply or demand in both directions ... when leveraged contracts come to maturity or settlement, they can cause large movements in the spot price,"" he said.  One exchange that recently introduced leveraged trading is BTCC. It launched its BTCC Pro Exchange last month, allowing traders to borrow up to 20 times their principal, leading to a ""noticeable"" uptick in trading activity, the exchange said.  ""We have seen a noticeable increase in users and activity since our introduction of 20x leveraged trading in mid-October,"" BTCC chief executive Bobby Lee said in a statement.  Leveraged trading  The disconnect between real-world bitcoin adoption and the bitcoin price is illustrated by the fact that the total number of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain has increased at a steady rate over the past year, nearly doubling from about 53 million transactions 12 months ago to some 95 million transactions today, according to Blockchain.info.  The bitcoin price, meanwhile, is trading at around $380 today – roughly the same level it was 12 months ago.  ""[Bitcoin transactions] have doubled in 12 months, while price hasn't!"" Milne said.  Besides leverage driving up volumes, some market observers also believe exchanges themselves have installed automated trading software to inflate the number of trades taking place on their platforms. This creates the illusion of a highly liquid marketplace, potentially attracting more customers.  Participants of Whale Club, a popular trading room on TeamSpeak, point the finger at exchanges for generating ""fake"" trades to pump up their volumes.  Milne, for one, believes this is the case:  ""It has become quite obvious to anyone watching the markets daily that some exchanges – I won't name them – appear to run 'bots' to ramp up their volume. I assume they believe they will attract more new customers if they appear higher in the table of exchange volume.""  Two China-based exchanges dominate the volume charts: OKCoin and Huobi, which collectively account for 78% of volume in the last 30 days, according to Bitcoinity.  By contrast, Bobby Lee's BTCC had about 5% of trading activity in the same period. Lee offers reasons for the increase in activity rooted in fundamental demand for bitcoin beyond speculators and the by-products of leveraged trading:  ""China overall has also seen a noticeable increase in volumes due to a combination of increased awareness of bitcoin as a useful digital asset, and concerns in China about the bearish stock markets here, the increasing strength of the US dollar vis-à-vis the yuan and global sovereign debt concerns.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/11/30/bitcoin-exchange-trading-volumes-hit-all-time-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ba25b477bc33a14331dc04b06e8cc766fc02a01-1000x604.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378427,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCTp,1448878578,Report: Barbados Central Bank Should Consider Holding Bitcoin,"Two Barbadian economists have concluded that the country's central bank may want to consider holding a small amount of bitcoin as part of its portfolio of foreign reserves.  In a new working paper, the authors examine the potential role cryptocurrencies could play as part of the portfolio of external assets held by a central bank, using Barbados as a case study.  The paper reads:  ""Within recent years, the proportion of digital transactions done using digital currencies has grown significantly. As a result, it is possible that digital currency could become a key currency for settling transactions.""  The paper goes on to note that the Barbadian dollar is pegged to the US dollar, and that as such, a reserve of foreign currencies keeps its money safe from speculative attacks.  While valuable in this regard, the authors state that the level of bitcoin reserves should be held in proportion to the digital currency's use by citizens.  ""Given that the proportion of transactions done by Barbadians in digital currency is not likely to exceed 10% of all transactions in the short run, it is recommended that if bitcoin is incorporated into the portfolio of foreign balances of the central bank of Barbados, that its share should be relatively small,"" it adds.  A nascent industry  The paper pointed out that while innovative, cryptocurrencies are still very much in the early stages of adoption, meaning that it believes many issues still need to be overcome before a central bank could consider including bitcoin in its reserve portfolio.  Additionally, the paper says that a central bank must first determine whether it perceives bitcoin to be a currency or a tradable asset.  ""Most early adopting jurisdictions see cryptocurrencies as assets and as such there are capital tax implications from the sale and purchase of such,"" adds the paper.  The paper further argues that, unless recognised commercial banks, financial and central banking entities actively participate in the market, regulators will continue to exert caution within the space.  However, it does suggest it is seeing signs that such momentum is occurring, noting:  ""Citibank's intention to create its own cryptocurrency for primarily transactional services does present a model for financial entities, if not central banks, to follow.""  Bitcoin mining  The paper also explores the possibility that the central bank may want to invest in bitcoin mining, but points out that in this instance, the costs to do so ""outweigh the immediate benefits"".  For the Central Bank of Barbados to competitively enter this space, the paper states, it would need to procure expertise in the subject and make a considerable investment into what the paper deems are rapidly evolving miner computer technologies.  Bearing this in mind, the paper says that it would be more prudent if the central bank were to become an active trader of the asset while also focusing on learning the necessary tools to transfer cryptocurrencies over the blockchain.  The primary objective of this, the paper explains, would be to replace or supplement existing systems such as SWIFT and real-time gross settlement systems.

42378409,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i91x,1448848862,Bitcoin Reputation Startup Bonafide to Shut Down,"Bitcoin reputation startup Bonafide has elected to cease operations and commence liquidation less than one year after raising $850,000 from investors including Blockchain Capital and Quest Venture Partners.  According to an email sent to shareholders and obtained by CoinDesk, Bonafide had been approached by a “leading” bitcoin company for possible acquisition, however, the sale was declined as it was deemed ""only beneficial to team members"", not investors.  Founded in 2013, the startup offered an API that provided reputation data to bitcoin firms offering exchange, wallet and other consumer services.  In the email, co-founders Karthik Balasubramanian and Brian Moyer stated their belief that the movement of investor interest away from consumer-facing applications for the technology was also a factor.  Balasubramanian and Moyer wrote:  ""While investment and activity continues to occur it is focused on private and alternate chains rather than bitcoin or other public chains where Bonafide operates.""  As a result, the co-founders said they saw ""little chance"" that they would be able to generate revenue, pivot their product or secure additional funding.  Moyer told CoinDesk that continued declines in consumer bitcoin spending were a prevailing factor in the shut down, and why the founding team won’t be rushing to start another project.  ""We don’t want to be consultants. We got a lot of traction, but it hasn’t grown. There’s just no movement in the bitcoin space. Because of our backgrounds, we could probably raise money doing something different, but they’re all long plays,"" he said.  Moyer indicated that the founding team had been working without salaries since as far back as April, and that it explored possibly pivoting to the bitcoin compliance sector as well.  As for what’s next for the team, Moyer was less clear, adding only:  ""We're still going to be watching [bitcoin] really close.""
