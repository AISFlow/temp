42376894,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gJuV,1392331518,Silk Road 2 Loses Over $2.6 Million in Bitcoins in Alleged Hack,"Dark market web site Silk Road 2 has told customers that all of their bitcoins are gone after a massive hack, in which at least 4,476 bitcoins (worth over $2.6m at current prices) are believed stolen. Organizers at the site are blaming the compromise on the transaction malleability attack in the news this week.  ""Our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol known as ""transaction malleability"" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty,"" said a post from Defcon, one of the site's moderators, on a forum, located on the Tor network.  The post added that thieves attacked after the organizers of the site took too long to respond to widespread industry concern about the transaction malleability attack. ""Despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the Bitcoin protocol itself,"" it said.  Generally, good security principles would have a bitcoin-based web site putting the bulk of bitcoins under management in cold storage (ie stored offline), so that they could not be stolen by online attackers. However, the post said that they were all stored online, because of back-end developments on the site.  ""We were planning on re-launching the new auto-finalize and Dispute Center this past weekend,"" Defcon said in the post. The implementation of the two features would have bumped up the volume of orders being finalized, causing the site to make all of the bitcoins instantly available.  The post came with profuse apologies. ""I should have taken MtGox and Bitstamp's lead and disabled withdrawals as soon as the malleability issue was reported. I was slow to respond and too skeptical of the possible issue at hand,"" Defcon said, before posting the fraudulent transactions, and asking for community help in bringing down the alleged thief.  The post suggested that the escrow wallets (which hold funds until goods have been delivered) were compromised. One thing that wasn't clear is whether users' personal wallets (holding funds that have been uploaded but not spent, or received from customers but not withdrawn) had been stolen.  Some postings on the forums suggested that they had also been compromised. ""Appears so at least in my case. While only .1286 BTC (deposited last night) I can see a transcation on blockchain that has sent payment to an address and I have made no such transaction,"" said one user, calling himself 'UncleFester'.  ""Blockchain showing my SR wallet emptied. So - escrow and wallets are all gone :-(,"" said another, 'meathead_420'.  Others suggested that all remaining coins may have been taken off the Silk Road 2 server while the situation was resolved.  How did it happen?  What is still unclear is just how a transaction malleability attack could have resulted in the complete emptying of an escrow account. The attack involves changing the ID of a bitcoin transaction, to make the sender think that it hasn't happened.  [post-quote]  As we detailed earlier this week, simply changing the ID isn't enough to cause a coin to be stolen. The individual or organisation sending the bitcoins (in this case, Silk Road) would presumably have to resend the coins immediately and automatically in the event of a fraudulent customer complaint, and would have to notice that almost 5000 bitcoins were disappearing from its escrow accounts without raising an eyebrow.  ""Sorry defcon but if mt gox and bitstamp had the hindsight to cancel withdraws while they dealt with the bug. Why did you not take the same measures?"" asked 'Soloist'.  ""Why did it take forever to move funds in and out of my wallet but every last bit of BTC disappears in the blink of an eye?"" said 'garconSR2' in response to the Defcon post.  Technical experts were bemused, and sceptical. ""Would criminals make dumb mistakes? Infinitely feasible. Most deep web sites like this are likely either honeypots or long-con scams,"" said core bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik.  Defon provided some details of the attack, explaining that someone, likely operating in France, used several vendor accounts to order from each other, to find and exploit the vulnerability. The primary account was named 'narco93', the post said.  Defcon offered to help those most at risk from the theft by using his own personal funds. At least one user, dimon114, seemed in need. ""If my vendors didn't ship what I ordered, I am now in some serious physical danger,"" they said.  While many questioned the honesty of the story, others pounced on the evidence provided by Defcon to try and find more details. One user found a wallet online which they said could be a likely destination for the funds. This blockchain wallet appears to have received 8566 bitcoins over 60 transactions in the last two days. Just over half of them are still in there at the time of writing. There is no proof that this wallet was used by any alleged bitcoin thief at this stage.

42376895,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gJx1,1392327664,California Bill Would Make Bitcoin 'Lawful Money',"Update (GMT 23:11): The California Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee indicates that AB 129 is now roughly halfway through the process to become law.  Due to its position as a hotbed for technological innovation, California has thus far adopted a friendly stance toward its emerging bitcoin and virtual currency communities.  This attitude of encouragement, while noticeable in its vibrant startup scene, has been best displayed in the actions of its government, which this September revised net worth requirements for state money transmitters with the passage of Assembly Bill 786.  Now, following a 29th January vote in which it passed a final round of vetting by the California Assembly, California seems poised to broaden its definition of ""lawful money"" to include virtual currencies with the passage of AB 129.  Perhaps most notably, the vote in favor of the new proposal was unanimous, with 75 votes for and 0 votes against the bill.  AB 129 was introduced last January by California State Assembly member and Banking and Finance Chairman Roger Dickinson (who also introduced AB 786), and on 6th February was sent to the Senate Banking and Finance Committee for a review of its potential monetary impact before moving on to the Senate.  Notably, AB 129 would formally legalize a broad range of alternatives to the US dollar that are already widely in use:  ""This bill makes clarifying changes to current law to ensure that various forms of alternative currency such as digital currency, points, coupons or other objects of monetary value do not violate the law when those methods are used for the purchase of goods and services or the transmission of payments.""  'Legal money'  The bill suggests that current state laws restrict the definition of money to the point where other forms of value, such as loyalty points or community currencies, are actually illegal under state law. As such, adverse actions taken against bitcoin, but not these equal alternatives under law, would represent a selective enforcement of the law.  The bill's most recent revision, issued 23rd January, allows people to issue any instrument of value that is ""redeemable for lawful money of the United States or that has value based on the value of lawful money of the United States"".  However, the bill would still give the US dollar precedent over alternatives, as it would ""prohibit a person from being required to accept alternative currency"".  Next steps for AB-129  Introduced in January 2013 first as a reform of the state's loan practices, the bill has taken a long road to the Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee. But, it has much further to go before it becomes law.  Explains a Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee spokesperson:  ""AB 129 is just about halfway through the process. It's passed the Assembly, but hasn't been heard by a policy committee in the Senate yet.""  Now in the Senate, the bill needs to pass three stages, the Senate Policy Committee, Senate Fiscal Committee and finally the Senate floor. However, if at any point the bill should be amended in the Senate, its road could become even longer, as it would need to head back the Assembly.  Should this amended bill be approved, its next stop would be the state governor, who would decide whether the bill becomes law.

42376898,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gK0n,1392314985,Bitcoin Now Accounts for 10% of Sales at Porn.com,"When Porn.com began accepting bitcoin for payments on 3rd January, it set off a wave of speculation that adult content would prove to be the ‘killer app’ that propelled mainstream adoption of the still nascent technology.  Driving this conversation were the impressive sales figures the site released in the aftermath of the announcement. Porn.com suggested that purchases had increased by 50% in the initial hours, before settling at 25% in the days that followed.  Despite the spike in business Porn.com received, though, sceptics have argued that accepting bitcoin has become nothing more than a “publicity stunt” for companies seeking to gain media attention.  Porn.com’s latest figures, however, provide evidence that refutes this claim.  David Kay, marketing director for Porn.com’s parent company, Sagan Ltd, spoke to CoinDesk about his company’s progress so far, and noted that after one month, bitcoin purchases have “stabilized at 10%” of its sales.  Kay said that having a payment method that appeals to its customer base is key to delivering quality content, and that bitcoin satisfies this need. He explained:  “I think surfers like the anonymity of purchasing a premium membership with bitcoin. They don’t have to worry about what shows up on their credit card statement.”  Naughty America, which also began accepting bitcoin this January, declined to provide current figures for its bitcoin sales, noting that it is currently experimenting with different pricing options based on reddit feedback.  Minimal risk  Initially not everyone at Porn.com was convinced that accepting bitcoin was the right move, although Kay’s latest comments suggest that the internal environment has since changed:  “There was a big debate around the office whether or not we should embrace something so new and volatile, but after finding out we could transfer the bitcoins almost instantly to cash, the risk seemed minimal.”  However, bitcoin is slowly becoming a bigger part of Porn.com operations. The site now keeps some bitcoin on its books for payments and acquisitions, and has even purchased a competitor who requested to be paid in BTC. (Kay declined to comment further, but did confirm the purchase.)  In addition, the company now offers live performers and affiliates the ability to accept bitcoins.  Big spenders  Porn.com has revealed that the United States has thus far accounted for the most bitcoin payments, with the United Kingdom and Canada rounding out the top three.  The findings are consistent with data from porn company Naughty America, which had previously expressed an interest in bitcoin’s potential to reach foreign markets.  As shown in the chart below, more than half of Naughty America’s sales have originated in North America:    Naughty America Bitcoin Purchases By Region | CoinDesk    Broken down by country, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia also had notable showings, accounting for 8.8%, 4.4% and 3.5% of sales, respectively.  Room for improvement  One of the more notable comments from Naughty America founder Andreas Hronopoulos, following his company’s decision to accept bitcoin, was his belief that adoption of the cryptocurrency would spread throughout the porn industry over the next two months.  Kay is less certain that bitcoin will spread so easily in the ecosystem.  “It will take time, because so much of the business is reliant on recurring subscriptions. Once that obstacle [is cleared], it will become widespread.”  A representative from popular San Francisco-based fetish website Kink.com suggested that his company is looking into bitcoin, but confirmed that the lack of subscription billing is a deterrent:  “The main problem is that bitcoin doesn’t rebill – meaning that for a subscription-based business like Kink, it’s not an immediate win.""  Despite the comments, however, Coinbase does offer subscription billing services, though unlike credit cards - which pull funds directly - the customer is required to send the final payment each month.  The comments suggest that either awareness of the service remains low, or there is a belief that such a service is insufficient to meet the needs of the adult entertainment business.

42376899,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gJzX,1392311676,Bank of Greece Breaks Silence on Bitcoin,"The Bank of Greece issued a brief statement on 11th February warning citizens of the potential risks associated with virtual currencies, such as bitcoin.  In particular, the bank cautioned that investors should be mindful that losses related to changes in the price of virtual currencies are not protected.  A recently released report from the Law Library of Congress, the research arm of the US Congress, suggests that this is the first time the Bank of Greece has issued a statement on virtual currencies.  Citing past statements from the European Banking Authority, the release included introductory information meant to guide consumer decision-making, as well as material that further informed readers of the potential tax implications and legal consequences associated with the use of virtual currency.  The announcement comes after a string of similar remarks from other European central banks, such as the Central Bank of Lithuania and the Central Bank of Cyprus, which both issued statements to raise awareness of the potential risks of virtual currencies in the last week.  The Bank of Greece did respond to requests for comment, but declined to elaborate on the timing of the release.  Initial reactions  Greek bitcoin users have suggested that bitcoin has yet to garner mainstream media attention in the country, and that awareness remains low as a result – although some businesses in major metropolitan areas are beginning to accept payments in BTC. Therefore, they say, the bank’s statement is unlikely to have much of an impact on the Mediterranean nation’s fledgling virtual currency ecosystem, but it could influence those who have yet to become involved.  Computer scientist and bitcoin enthusiast George Zervos described the current state of the ecosystem to CoinDesk:  “I can assure you that most people [have] heard about bitcoin, but [they] don't exactly know what it is or how to explain it to someone if asked.”  Zervos went on to suggest that Greece’s ongoing problems with tax evasion have likely stoked fears in its banking community that more wealth could “flow out of the country into bitcoin exchanges [in order to] to avoid tax”.  Potential impact  Problems with the Greek banking system in 2013 were initially cited as one of the driving factors of bitcoin's surge in value, along with similar issues in Cyprus, Italy and Spain.  At the time, Greece was in the midst of imposing severe austerity measures in an attempt to fight its escalating debt-to-GDP ratio, and members of the bitcoin community, such as Charlie Shrem publicly discussed how bitcoin’s advantages could prove attractive to the market.  When asked, members of Greece’s bitcoin community seemed convinced that the bank’s statement will not affect current bitcoin users.  Zervos concluded:  “We all know that banks are fighting bitcoin in one way or another. Personally I think not much has changed since this warning.”  Bitcoin developer and miner Yorgos Ntovas agreed Greek bitcoin users will be indifferent to the statement.  “I do not think that the Bank of Greece has any impact in Greece’s bitcoin ecosystem. The Bank of Greece has a bad reputation in Greece, and for that, users do not pay any attention at all,” he said.

42376904,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gK8L,1392303580,Enthusiasts and Investors Defend Bitcoin at Inside Bitcoins Berlin,"Bitcoin enthusiasts, investors and entrepreneurs staged a spirited defence of the cryptocurrency at the Inside Bitcoins conference in Berlin this week.  With Mt. Gox's malleability issues now affecting popular exchanges Bitstamp and BTC-e, many commentators have been quick to declare this the final nail in bitcoin's coffin.  This is the “glitch that will help end bitcoin” declared Bloomberg's Leonid Bershidsk. He went on to argue that bitcoin is now only propped up by a small number of individuals with too much capital invested to allow the currency to fail completely.  “Not a chance” came the response from bitcoiners at the conference in the German capital.  Oliver Flaskämper, CEO of Bitcoin Germany, kicked off the event by saying that only two things could pose a permanent threat to bitcoin: a major technical issue or global ban – neither of which have happened yet.  The current transaction malleability issue will soon be resolved and bitcoin will come back stronger, he said. And as far as a global ban goes, it would be almost impossible: “Anyone who wants to ban bitcoin will have to ban the Internet,” he said, to applause from the audience.  Blockchain CEO  Bitcoin evangelist and worldwide bitcoin traveller Nicholas Cary, also known as the CEO of Blockchain.info, said he is paying close attention to the ongoing glitches, but remains confident they will be resolved soon. He said:  “Individual service providers are going to have to issue patches and longer term some thinking may evolve of how to best approach this. We will rely on the core development team to give us guidance.”  The conference drew over 300 people from 14 countries for two days of discussions focusing on the future of bitcoin.  A new umbrella organisation was also launched, the Global Bitcoin Alliance – a “bottom-up network of non-for-profit organisations that promote and protect Bitcoin.”  Aaron Koenig of Bitcoin Exchange Berlin is one of the founders of the Alliance. He claims this is the perfect time launch an organization that defends bitcoins against attacks. However, he sees the alliance as a support group rather than a leader in the fight.  “The real work will have to be done on a local level. But we will be there to help provide information and support,” he said.  The death of bitcoin?  So, what is the newly formed alliance's reaction to the rumours of bitcoin's demise?  “The death of bitcoin has been announced so many times, but bitcoin is very strong, a very resilient piece of technology that can not so easily be taken down. It will only make bitcoin stronger.”  One conference participant who is a veteran of several bitcoin crises is Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China and the man who was caught in the middle of China's regulatory maelstrom back in December 2013.  He was calm about the current crisis, saying only that it will be ""worked out soon"". However, he was keen to set the record straight about bitcoin in China.  “Bitcoin in China is not over by any means,” he said. He went on to explain that the sanctions imposed were not as draconian as sometimes reported. What was more of a problem were the verbal warnings the regulators gave financial institutions.  In essence, it was a case of the regulators quietly asking the institutions to stay away from bitcoin rather then imposing laws.  The effect of this is that bitcoin trading is down 80 to 90% in China, and this will probably continue over the next six to 12 months. However, after this cooling off period, bitcoin will be back, Lee said.  “All the goodness of bitcoin has not changed. What have changed are the perceived regulations around bitcoin. It needs a few months to clear out and settle. After that, bitcoin will continue its meteoric rise”  Fighting talk from the bitcoin evangelists – only time will tell if they can prove the skeptics wrong.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Jona Kallgren,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/13/enthusiasts-and-investors-defend-bitcoin-at-inside-bitcoins-berlin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49354468d166be2a6d9f0b9bc2fb7980b64b4fc3-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376888,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gJqj,1392299367,Bullion Bitcoin to Launch Gold-Bitcoin Exchange,"A new exchange for trading gold bullion and bitcoin is set to open on 21st February.  The Bullion Bitcoin exchange, based in London, will allow sophisticated investors, as defined by the UK financial regulator, to trade gold bullion and bitcoin. The exchange will not be open to retail investors.  Adam Cleary, Bullion Bitcoin’s owner said:  “It seemed to me we should create an exchange that’s completely free of any fiat currency constraints. There are no fiat currency accounts – it’s directly gold for bitcoin.”  Access to the exchange will be restricted to sophisticated investors, high net-worth individuals and professional clients, as defined by the Financial Conduct Authority, the financial services regulator in the United Kingdom. Traders on the exchange will also have to put up a minimum subscription of 1kg of gold (about $41,000).  Bids and asks  Bullion Bitcoin will ‘fix’ the price of gold in bitcoin terms twice a day. Traders will submit bids and asks for bitcoin and gold during these sessions. The exchange will then attempt to match the majority of the bids and asks. This process is similar to the ‘London gold fix’, a price-setting exercise that takes place twice daily among members of the London Gold Market Fixing Ltd, by tele-conference.  “Twice a day, traders [on Bullion Bitcoin] will have to log in and put in their bids. The system is not designed for high-frequency trading at all. It’s designed to be a more sedate, physical-type exchange,” Cleary said.  Cleary said he would target gold investors new to digital currencies and bitcoin investors seeking to diversify their holdings. He added:  “I’m hoping to appeal to goldbugs who might be looking for a way to move their gold to bitcoin. There are also people have who made a lot of bitcoin from the early years, and want to move into something tangible.”  Bullion Bitcoin has an account with a bullion dealer and storage firm called BullionRock. The firm, based in Guernsey, has underground vaults to store the precious metal as bars or gold grain.  Exchange customers will have the option of collecting their physical bullion from the storage firm, having it delivered to them or having it converted to fiat currency. Traders on the exchange can also make bitcoin withdrawals.  “They have a massive vault underground, they have a number of boxes, and they go in there to count the bars to make sure it’s all there. Most people tend to leave their bars in a box,” Cleary said.  Security and regulation features  Cleary said Bullion Bitcoin has a number of security features built into it. Withdrawals, for example, will require two signatures, from the account holder and the exchange administrator, before they are approved.  Another measure by Bullion Bitcoin to increase transparency is to record all its transactions on the blockchain. A customer who deposits bitcoin to their Bullion Bitcoin wallet, for example, will have his or her transaction recorded on the blockchain. Bullion Bitcoin will charge a 0.5% commission on each trade.  Bullion Bitcoin is owned by Cavenham Capital, which is, in turn, solely owned by Cleary. Cavenham is registered and regulated by the UK FCA. Cleary started Cavenham in 2005 and has used the firm to run its own investment fund and to consult for other funds. Before Cavenham, Cleary was a trader with Dresdner, Mizuho and other banks, and a research analyst at ING.  Paper gold  Cleary said he hoped the security and other measures in place at Bullion Bitcoin would assuage investor fears about the assets:  “The thing we’re trying to avoid here is what’s called ‘paper gold’, where you might have a bank that says it has the gold [to back up an investment product based on gold derivatives], but it turns out to be a load of paper promises. It’s a bit like having bitcoin in Mt. Gox unfortunately. It might be there, it might not.”  In January, a firm called Ripple Singapore launched that allowed users to trade precious metals, including gold bullion, for a variety of currencies, including bitcoin, on the Ripple network.  The relationship between bitcoin and gold was highlighted by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, who called bitcoin “a better version of gold”, or “Gold 2.0”. Neither bitcoin or gold are centrally controlled by any state body.

42376890,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gJrz,1392293902,Mt. Gox Founder Jed McCaleb Working on Mystery Bitcoin Project,"The original founder of Mt. Gox, Jed McCaleb, has revealed that he is working on a secret bitcoin-related project, but he isn't giving much away.  McCaleb is the creator of Mt. Gox, for years the world’s largest and best-known bitcoin exchange. After he sold his stake in Mt. Gox in 2011, he created Ripple and made a few interesting investments along the way.  Now McCaleb wants to get back into the game. But the big question is – with what?  The investor claims he is working on “something that will be better for bitcoin and better for you”, and is looking for alpha testers for his mystery project. This is all that he has revealed so far:  ""When I sold Mt. Gox a few years ago, bitcoin was trading at less than a dollar. Today bitcoin exists in a new environment. Mt. Gox is struggling to keep up. Now, I am building something that will be better for Bitcoin and better for you. I’m looking for alpha testers.""  So what is it all about?  In short, we don’t know.  There is plenty of speculation, but for the time being there is no concrete information on the project. The fact that McCaleb is a rather enigmatic and doesn’t like to talk to the media doesn’t help, either.  McCaleb’s track record speaks for itself. He is the quintessential peer-to-peer pioneer and he didn’t shy away from controversial projects, like file sharing services.  However, since then McCaleb has shifted to more down to earth projects like Mt. Gox, followed by Ripple. The latter is still in beta, but it is supposed to act as a distributed payment and currency exchange network, with a native currency of its own (XRP).  It is a somewhat controversial idea. Some members of the bitcoin community argue that it is too centralized, while others believe it is positive step in the evolution of digital currencies.  So, judging by his earlier efforts, we should expect something provocative, controversial and, of course, innovative. Other than that, it's anyone's guess.  Looking for devs, testers, designers  Since the project is secret, it also has an appropriately named website: secretbitcoinproject.com. Needless to say, the site doesn’t offer much in the way of information, but it does include a call for developers, alpha testers and a designer.

42376902,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gK4Z,1392290069,Mt. Gox Founder Mark Karpeles Responds to Critics,"Mt. Gox chief executive and founder Mark Karpeles has fired back at critics in a recent interview with Forbes.  Both Karpeles and Mt. Gox have been taking a lot of flak since the exchange suspended bitcoin withdrawals last week. The decision was brought about by transaction malleability issues, which indirectly led to a massive DDoS attack targeting bitcoin exchanges on Monday.  Since then Mt. Gox has tried – and largely failed – to reassure the bitcoin community, while the bitcoin price dropped to its lowest point this year.  Who is to blame?  When asked whether the problem was caused by the Bitcoin protocol itself or Mt. Gox's implementation, Karpeles told Forbes that the Bitcoin client is simply not designed to handle the sort of load that Mt. Gox experiences.  He added that the exchange chose to develop its own implementation to overcome lagging and crashing. However, as the Bitcoin protocol was constantly updated, Mt. Gox simply could not keep up. Karpeles explained:  “With bitcoin 0.8.0 [...] a breaking change has been included that would prevent transactions to be accepted if their signature did not include the right number of zeroes in front of the signature values (in an effort to reduce risks of transaction malleability). We did not notice this change but a few of the transactions we were sending would become invalid because of this.”  Karpeles said Mt. Gox started looking into the problems and began being “more transparent” in an effort to provide the public with a full list of pending transactions.  “Nobody was however able to tell us what went wrong at that time. Since only a few transactions were affected anyway we didn’t give it much attention (recently we were able to look more into this and fix this issue),” said Karpeles.  He continued: “This meant however that some of our invalid transactions were listed publicly, making it rather easy for someone with bad intention to alter these, hence the reason why many people claim there was an issue in our code.”  He added that exchanges using the standard Bitcoin client were a lot less likely to be affected by the problem.  There is no quick fix  Karpeles said he is puzzled by the fact that the Bitcoin Foundation failed to address the transaction malleability problem after it was originally identified in 2011.  He said that Mt. Gox proposed a solution that would allow people who send coins to track them no matter what happens in terms of malleability. The solution would not be perfect, but it could be applied quickly and it wouldn’t “break” anything.  Bitcoin developers are currently working on another way to tackle the problem, but it will take more time to deploy and it may break some custom clients.  Karpeles was keen to point out that the Mt. Gox announcement allowed other exchanges to be more cautious when faced with failing transactions. Although it upset a lot of people, it also helped a lot of people understand and deal with the problem, he argues.  Mt. Gox and Karpeles have long been a source of controversy within the bitcoin community, even before the malleability issue forced the exchange to suspend bitcoin withdrawals.

42376903,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gK75,1392285851,Why Life Under Bitcoin Regulation Will Be Worse Than Investors Think,"Fewer startups. A drain of top talent. Jobs and opportunities pushed overseas.  These are the nightmare outcomes that Atlantic Financial founder, 20-year Wall Street veteran and Bitcoin Financial Association member Bruce Fenton believes could befall the bitcoin industry, should US lawmakers heed calls for regulation from the bitcoin community.  Having worked under the conditions imposed by traditional financial regulation, Fenton offers an insider's account of how detrimental these policies could be for bitcoin's growth and ultimate longevity.  ""[The traditional financial system has] seen firsthand the damages regulation can cause. Some of the people who spoke at the hearings in New York, they're well-meaning people, they say things like 'We need regulation', but I don't think they understand what they're asking for,"" Fenton said.  Fenton claimed that applying existing regulation to the bitcoin industry could adversely affect bitcoin startups - which already operate in an uncertain market - virtually overnight.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Fenton discussed what was at risk:  ""What innovations have we seen in the banking or financial sector in the last 30 years? Almost nothing. Nobody ever decides to start a bank out of their garage, there is no Google, PayPal or Youtube-like innovation that's come out of banking or finance, because it's so scary to people they don't even bother to try to begin with.""  A day under bitcoin regulation  Recently, Fenton has become more outspoken about his belief that regulation is not the solution the bitcoin industry needs.  Drawing on his experience working at major investment firms, Fenton painted a vivid picture of what bitcoin business owners could expect under regulation:  All correspondences, including email, would be monitored.  All emails would need to be saved and reviewed.  All public speaking events would need to be approved, and all content published ahead of time.  Certain written materials would need to be reviewed by compliance officers and regulators.  Company representatives would need to take continuing education and be regularly fingerprinted.  Further he named the following, seemingly innocent actions as examples of regulatory violations:  A client moves out of state, and the company reaches out to this client though they are not licensed in that state.  An assistant answers the phone for a client who wants sell a fund and executes the order though they are not registered to.  What New York got wrong  Fenton noted it was the New York hearings that partly influenced his decision to offer guidance to the reddit community.  Speaking to CoinDesk, he reiterated that though both sides likely had the best intentions, he was shocked by some of the suggestions, such as how New York officials suggested regulating miners, simply for running free programs on their computers.  However, Fenton isn't against regulation altogether.  Rather, he believes that many existing consumer protection laws – those that prevent harm and violence – can easily be applied to bitcoin, but this definition of regulation is far from the result that the ecosystem would see enacted.  ""I understand regulators want to regulate. If they must do something in this space, there's a lot of productive things they could do,"" he said.  Choosing smart regulation  Should these parties choose to enact new regulations, Fenton had several suggestions for how they could move forward and benefit the ecosystem.  He proposed that states like New York should work with their law enforcement officials to protect bitcoin consumers from fraud, theft and hacking. Furthermore, he added that there is work that could be done to help miners and overall block chain security.  Fenton also encouraged investors and those in the community to consider what illegal actions – like theft and fraud – aren't already enforceable in the bitcoin space under current law.  To sum up this point, Fenton asked:  “Supposed we didn't have a single new regulation covering bitcoin, what would be the situation where we would have a victim, where a real human being would be harmed because of that?""

42376891,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6gJpT,1392267847,Canada's Finance Minister Prepares to Regulate Bitcoin,"Signals are emerging that Canada is about to tighten its grip on bitcoin and other decentralized digital currencies. The country's finance minister Jim Flaherty singled out bitcoin by name in his federal budget today, and announced forthcoming laws that would regulate it.  ""It is important to continually improve Canada’s regime to address emerging risks, including virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, that threaten Canada’s international leadership in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing,"" said Flaherty in the budget document.  The budget went on to promise ""anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations for virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin.""  When such laws emerge, they will most likely be developed by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), which is the country's financial intelligence unit, responsible for preventing money laundering and other financial acts that could support terrorism.  Changing attitudes to bitcoin  FINTRAC has practically ignored bitcoin since its inception, but things may be changing. An internal report from the organization, obtained through an Access to Information request, has revealed that the agency is contemplating a range of regulatory measures.  Options that the agency may be considering include an potential plan to ""choke bitcoins oxygen"" [sic] by denying Canadians access to foreign exchange markets, said reports. It is also said to have considered forcing bitcoin exchanges underground, but acknowledges the potential downside for consumers.  FINTRAC’s hands-off approach has enabled numerous start-ups to flourish in Canada, said Michael Patryn, director of the Vancouver Bitcoin Co-Op, and of new Vancouver bitcoin exchange QuadrigaCX. ""Entrepreneurs are comfortable with their country’s regulatory stance, and are therefore able to offer new services and create new jobs without the burden of excessive regulatory requirements stifling their innovation,"" he said  Jesse Heaslip, who runs Vancouver-based white label exchange software company Bex.io, also argued that FINTRAC's hands-off approach has been a good thing for the industry.  ""When I compare where Canadian entrepreneurs are focusing their attention in the bitcoin ecosystem compared to our American counterparts there is no question that we are spending more time, effort and energy on innovation,"" he said, pointing to projects like Ethereum, CoinKite, and his own Bex as home-grown examples.  [post-quote]  FINTRAC has been so hands off in the past that Canadian exchanges have had a hard time getting it to take notice of them. Mike Curry, founder of Toronto-based Vault of Satoshi, tried to apply for an MSB license last year, but was refused, on the basis that as a bitcoin business he didn't need one. It's time for some clarity, he said.  ""Thus far we've been treating digital currency with the same care as we do with fiat (in terms of AML/KYC),"" Curry acknowledged. ""I think they need to make a decision and figure out what regulations need to be or not be in place, sooner rather than later.""  Like many south of the border, Heaslip wants consistency. ""The best possible outcome would be if there was one global license that was required rather than having an application for each individual country and or state,"" he said. ""That would limit the mental and financial burden on entrepreneurs around the regulatory issues and allow us to focus on innovation in the marketplace.""  Eric Spano, director of finance at the Montreal-based Bitcoin Embassy and a director of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, said that the Canadian government had let bitcoin breathe for a while without regulatory smothering, and welcomed the next step.  ""Now that Canada is becoming a hub for Bitcoin enthusiasts and businesses, we're very happy to see FINTRAC's interest in the technology,"" he said. ""The establishment of a regulatory framework that mitigates money laundering and fraud risks, while continuing to enable Canadian businesses and startups to create innovative technologies and services, will continue to attract talent and venture capital from around the world.""  When FINTRAC turns its attention to a subject, it has a history of aggressive reporting. Two separate audits have found the agency to exceed its mandate when pursuing and storing personal information, for example. It was discovered to have been processing reports of financial activity without explaining why they should have been considered suspicious. The Canadian bitcoin community will be watching its next move with interest.

42376885,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6fyCN,1392250704,Asian Exchange Additions Drive Dogecoin Price Surge,"The addition of dogecoin to Chinese-language exchange BTC38 and Hong Kong-based ANX has driven the market capitalization of the meme-based virtual currency to $91m, up roughly $40m over the last 24 hours, according to figures from Coinmarketcap.  With the announcement, BTC38 and ANX join Canada-based exchange Vault of Satoshi as the latest to offer dogecoin trading to its users.  Unsurprisingly, the news sparked a flurry of excitement on reddit, with commenters eager to see dogecoin's community spirit translate to a new market.  About the exchanges  BTC38.com is registered to a China-based company, though other details about its service remain scarce. Its press release center suggests it began publishing material last October, just before harsh restrictions were enacted in China that limited bitcoin's use and reduced its value. Site data further suggests its web services came online around that date.  Currently, nearly 70% of its traffic comes from China, while 8% comes from the US.  Information about ANX is more readily available, with its website noting that it has secured a Money Services Operator (MSO) license from the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department.  Further, CEO Ken Lo took to reddit to personally inform the dogecoin community of the announcement, while support teams helped facilitate the initial round of trading. Initial trading was also conducted during a promotional no-fee period.  A short-lived boost?  Notably, BTC38 recently become of interest to the dogecoin community due to its friendly stance toward other altcoins, such as quarkcoin.  Because of this, data from Coinmarketcap suggests dogecoin's momentum may be short-lived. Following quarkcoin's inclusion on BTC38, the altcoin saw its market capitalization rise from $23m on 19th January to a high of 30m on 20th January.  This 34% increase was swiftly followed by a decline to $21m on 21st January.  Further interest in dogecoin may have also been driven by its association with the Olympic games, as its community proved integral to ensuring that the Jamaican bobsled team were given a chance to compete in Sochii.  A hedge against bitcoin?  The increase also coincided with bitcoin's price decline following the news that Mt. Gox, Bitstamp and other major exchanges faced a massive DDoS attack. Perhaps coincidentally, the value of dogecoin also saw a surge during bitcoin's December decline.  Commenting on the Mt. Gox issues, dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer told CoinDesk that he was unconcerned with the currency's potential to capitalize on such market movements. Said Palmer:  ""I don't really subscribe to the idea that the viability of a digital currency should be pegged to it's exchange rate when converted to another currency such as USD. Bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin and any digital currencies viability hinges on adoption, use and belief in the coin as a store of value independent to what you can cash out to fiat cash for.""  However, reddit commentators seem intrigued, suggesting that dogecoin's continued growth may lead it to serve as a hedge against bitcoin's volatility, especially as litecoin's price has shown to move with bitcoin.
