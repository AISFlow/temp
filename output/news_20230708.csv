After convening a roundtable of crypto analysts last month to assess the impact of the Federal Reserve’s hawkish pause decision on cryptos, SA asked a panel of six analysts to ponder the big questions about the state of crypto in 2023 as well as the critical issues that will shape its future. Kicking off part two of the crypto roundtable, two SA analysts – Logan Kane and John Miller – view Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ), which allows investors to gain indirect exposure to bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and avoid the inconveniences of physical custody, as the best crypto pick for the next six months. “I believe Bitcoin is the only game in town for crypto, and that the unique circumstances of GBTC make GBTC the best way to play Bitcoin,” Kane said. Miller shared a similar view, favoring “bitcoin-adjacent names with an angle.” Asked about their year-end predictions for the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), most analysts leaned toward betting on a downward trajectory from the current mark of $30.2K as of Friday afternoon, but didn’t rule out an eventual rally. Clem Chambers , for instance, reckons BTC can hit as low as $13K, “but the most likely answer is $25,000. The way Bitcoin is riding out the regulatory disaster zone, almost any price sub-$100,000 is possible, but I remain a bear sitting out this crazy dance.” As for the biggest event for the rest of 2023 that will affect investors, “It’s all about the” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Chambers contended, noting the lingering question is whether the regulator wants to “regulate crypto, or kill it.” Amid the fallout from high-profile bankruptcies like crypto exchange FTX and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, the SEC has ramped up scrutiny of the emerging space, having sued two of the largest crypto exchanges – Binance and Coinbase Global ( COIN ) – last month for violating securities laws. A victory by the SEC could weigh on crypto adoption in the U.S. as most crypto exchanges likely would not be able to operate in the country. Similarly, Kennan Mell argued: “The event that would have the largest impact on my crypto investment strategy is a verdict in the SEC's lawsuits that clarifies which cryptocurrencies are securities. "" Of note, the SEC has long contended that most digital tokens qualify as securities rather than currencies. “If Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is ruled a commodity,” Mell added, “I would be comfortable allocating a larger part of my portfolio to Ethereum, as regulatory risk is the biggest issue that I see facing Ethereum today. However, we may not be fortunate enough to get a final verdict on this in 2023.” Other SA contributors took note of other big catalysts, including a potential dovish Fed pivot, the Ripple ( XRP-USD ) litigation, Binance’s woes and GBTC’s ( OTC:GBTC ) conversion case.

At its peak in June, USDT was experiencing a daily trading volume of $33 billion, making USDT the number one most traded cryptocurrency in the world. However, with the U.S. economy struggling and several banks collapsing, some investors believe that stablecoins may not be as safe as first perceived. As a result, many investors are now choosing to diversify their portfolios with new altcoins like Tradecurve, which is on track to hit a 125% ROI in July. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale USDT Experiences A Surge In Tokens On Exchanges Throughout June, a total of 13.4 billion USDT was sent to cryptocurrency exchanges. This mass movement has been triggered by a recent SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase, as well as 55 new cryptocurrencies being added to the SEC’s list of securities. An increase in USDT being sent to exchanges could suggest that many investors are looking to buy altcoins and other cryptocurrencies, which is good news for the market. This would imply that the market is turning bearish, which will likely drive up the value of projects. However, an increase in USDT transactions could also suggest that investors want to minimize losses. This could explain the current increase in USDT transactions, as many projects have decreased in value by over 30% Tradecurve’s Stage 4 Presale Starts With A Big Win Although USDT is pegged to the USD, which in theory makes it more stable, Tradecurve is providing investors with significantly higher returns. Tradecurve started its presale at $0.01 and has already increased to $0.018, an 80% ROI for bullish investors. Now the project is on track to increase to $0.0215, taking its token returns to 125%. While these returns sound high, experts predict that Tradecurve could surge by 50x during its presale, meaning there are still plenty of opportunities for investors to profit. Tradecurve has been able to thrive during the recent market conditions due to its unique new hybrid exchange. The Tradecurve exchange will combine the best of decentralized exchanges, including anonymous trading, with the best of centralized exchanges, such as the opportunity to trade traditional assets. This all-in-one exchange is the perfect solution to current market trends and will open up thousands of opportunities for investors. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Another benefit of Tradecurve is its unique educational features. As part of Tradecurves ecosystem, investors will be able to profit from AI trading bots with a proven track record, as well as copy trading subscriptions. Copy trading will allow experienced investors to generate an income, while providing new investors with the opportunity to learn from the market's most experienced veterans. In addition, Tradecurve has also developed a lucrative metaverse trading academy designed for traders of all levels. Just four stages into its presale Tradecurve has raised $2.8 million and is being compared to the Binance ICO. Stage four tokens are currently selling out fast, with crypto whales buying at record rates to maximize their returns in one of the market's highest potential projects.

The pre-release contains 316,000 coins for sale, fixed at 6 USD per coin, in honour of the official unification of England and Scotland in 1707, 316 years ago. The pre-release presents an opportunity to purchase BritanniaCoin before its launch on exchanges at 8 USD per coin. BritanniaCoin is also launching a software wallet for the public, downloadable on the Apple App Store and Google Play. As part of BritanniaCoin's commitment to charitable causes, 10% of the proceeds from the pre-sale will be donated to charity, as listed on the BritanniaCoin website. During its pre-sale this summer, BritanniaCoin intends to give away 125,000 coins. BritanniaCoin is 100% self-funded and developed with no silent partners, as detailed in the white paper.

Moreover, the prospect of providing customers of the planned NFT project with access to hardware wallets in the future is something that is currently being considered. Following the completion of its 2nd stage ICO, BritanniaCoin intends to center its blockchain ecosystem, brand identity, and community on this hardware technology basis. BritanniaCoin pursues multiple long-term goals, including expanding its community and improving the user experience. In addition, BritanniaCoin has its own British-themed NFT project that provides holders unique advantages, offering access to airdrops, special discounts, voting rights, an active role in selecting which charity institutions to support and signature events, such as their recent pre-release party held at the East India Club. In the aftermath of the ICO, BritanniaCoin intends to launch BritanniaPay, consisting of their software wallet compatible with iOS and Android and connected with the company's current hardware wallet network.

Users can pay for their purchases at various UK and international retailers with BritanniaCoin alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum and other established cryptocurrencies. BritanniaCoin unites a diverse team, as the Co-founder and CEO Daniel M. Ashworth brings over five years of experience in the cryptocurrency sector and co-founded Aptius in 2018, a Crypto and Forex trading company.

14657127,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/gemini-sues-dcg-after-dispute-over-earn-program,1688824200,Gemini Sues DCG After Dispute Over Earn Program,"Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini is suing DCG, the parent company of bankrupt crypto broker Genesis, after a dispute over the Gemini Earn Program. The exchange decided to sue Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its CEO after the company missed the deadline to agree to a restructuring deal put forward by the Winklevoss twins. The Restructuring Proposal Winklevoss twins-founded Gemini exchange had set Thursday afternoon as the deadline for Digital Currency Group and Genesis to agree to a restructuring deal. Gemini stated that if the deal was not agreed to within the specified deadline, it would pursue litigation. Crypto lending firm Genesis had filed for bankruptcy in January following the collapse of key counterparties of the firm, such as FTX, causing it to freeze all redemptions. While Genesis’ lending unit had outlined a plan to exit bankruptcy, it has so far been unable to reach an agreement on a restructuring plan for creditors, to whom it owes over $3 billion. The largest creditor, Winklevoss twins-founded Gemini, is looking to recover around $1.1 billion. In a letter to DCG CEO Barry Silbert, Cameron Winklevoss shared what he called his “best and final offer” and stated that the deadline for DCG to agree to the proposal was 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) on July 6, adding that he wanted a simple yes or no answer and no further delays or extensions. The restructuring proposal put forward by Winklevoss included a forbearance payment of $275 million, a debt tranche of $355 million due in two years, and another debt tranche of $835 million due in five years. DCG would also be able to retain the proceeds from the sale of Genesis’ lending unit. DCG Misses Deadline, Gemini Sues However, DCG missed the deadline set by Gemini to agree to the restructuring deal, leading to the latter suing DCG. According to the lawsuit, DCG and its CEO, Barry Silbert, misrepresented the accounting treatment of liabilities that the company had assumed from Genesis. These liabilities stemmed from losses that Genesis suffered after the Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) collapsed. In a long thread on Twitter, Cameron Winklevoss stated that the exchange had filed a lawsuit against DCG and Silbert for personally masterminding a fraud scheme against creditors. “Today, @Gemini filed a lawsuit against @DCGco and @BarrySilbert personally in New York court. Barry was not only the architect and mastermind of the DCG and Genesis fraud against creditors; he was directly and personally involved in perpetrating it.” Winklevoss alleged that after Gemini discontinued the Earn program, Silbert reached out to the firm, urging them to continue the program even after knowing that Genesis was “massively insolvent.” “When Gemini notified Genesis it would be terminating the Earn program in October 2022, Barry reached out to set up a meeting to induce Gemini to continue Earn. He did this knowing Genesis was massively insolvent. Barry claimed that Genesis faced only a timing issue – a lie that hid the gaping hole on Genesis’s balance sheet.” Winklevoss further alleged that even after the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, Silbert, and other Genesis executives claimed everything was fine because DCG was stepping in to absorb the losses. “When Three Arrows Capital (3AC) collapsed in June 2022, it blew a $1.2 billion hole in Genesis’s balance sheet. Instead of coming clean, Genesis claimed that everything was business as usual because DCG had stepped in to absorb the losses. It’s now clear this was a carefully crafted lie.” The Gemini co-founder went on to allege that DCG, Silbert, and other Genesis executives conspired to create false financial reports to mislead creditors. “Barry, DCG, and Genesis all conspired to create false financial reports to hide the truth from Gemini and creditors. One report pretended that this phony 10-YEAR promissory note was a ‘Current Asset.’ A total lie and complete misrepresentation. A falsified balance sheet pretended that the note was a ‘receivable’ with a value of $1.1 billion. Another lie.” However, in a statement, A DCG spokesperson reiterated that DCG expects to close the Genesis bankruptcy case soon enough. “Any suggestion of wrongdoing by DCG or any of its employees is baseless, defamatory, and completely false. From day one, DCG has remained committed to reaching an amicable solution for all parties to the Genesis bankruptcy.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The agreement will enable Google Cloud, a $225-billion data and cloud service, to extend Bitcoin-related services worldwide while assisting Voltage's global operations expansion. Google’s Outsourced Bitcoin and Lightning Team The collaboration sees Voltage functioning as Google's outsourced Bitcoin and Lightning team. Voltage CEO, Graham Krizek, explained that the infrastructure provider will facilitate Bitcoin or Lightning integration for companies interested in these services via Google. The deal has not only generated substantial social media interest but also signals Google’s evolving recognition of Bitcoin and Lightning's potential. This increased attention isn't isolated within Google alone, but industry-wide. Christopher Calicott, managing director of venture capital firm Tramell Venture Partners, suggested that any corporation adjacent to payments ""would ignore Lightning at their peril."" Google Ventures Fueling Bitcoin Momentum Google's interests in blockchain, Bitcoin, and Web3 companies have been increasingly apparent since 2020, primarily via Google Ventures (GV), its investment arm. Voltage benefited from GV's interest, receiving participation in a $6-million seed round in 2021. This significant financial backing is seen as an indication of the rising momentum for Bitcoin and related technologies. Calicott pointed out that when companies invest, it sends a potent signal of their focus, adding weight to the Bitcoin and Lightning narrative. Krizek concurred, stating that the partnership is indicative of an increased Bitcoin focus strategy within larger organizations, including Google. Despite its competitor, Apple, showing an aversion to Lightning by recently delisting Damus, a Lightning-friendly decentralized social media protocol, the Lightning Network is gaining traction among billion-dollar businesses globally. Both Binance and Coinbase, two leading crypto exchanges, have recently committed to Lightning integrations. Google Cloud's partnership with Voltage marks a significant step towards further integrating Bitcoin and Lightning technologies within the wider tech industry. With the growing corporate interest and investment in these areas, the expectation for further services rollout, along with expanded efforts in Bitcoin education, continues to rise.

14654540,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/lightning-labs-integrates-ai-for-bitcoin-transactions-btc,1688817600,Lightning Labs Integrates AI For Bitcoin Transactions $BTC,"Lightning Labs, the primary Bitcoin Lightning Network development firm, has rolled out a revolutionary set of tools designed for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. These tools enable AI applications to directly interact with Bitcoin transactions on the network's layer-2 solution, including sending, receiving, and holding Bitcoin. Unveiling an AI-Compatible Toolkit Introduced on July 6, this toolkit stands to significantly benefit Large Language Models (LLMs)—software applications trained on extensive datasets to generate human-like responses. By integrating these new tools, LLMs can bypass traditional payment processes, making transactions faster, cheaper, and enabling pay-per-use AI models on the lightning network. The toolkit is built on two key components—the ""L402 protocol"" and ""Langchain"". The L402 protocol is an authentication mechanism unique to the Lightning Network, designed to streamline payments within the network. Langchain, on the other hand, is a library that simplifies AI application operations. Enhancing Accessibility and Interactions This suite of tools aims to increase the accessibility of AI infrastructure for both humans and autonomous AI agents. A significant feature, LangChainBitcoin, allows Langchain agents to interact directly with Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. This interaction includes capabilities such as holding a Bitcoin balance and sending/receiving Bitcoin on Lightning, functionalities made possible through the recently released OpenAI GPT function calls. This development is especially impactful for the fast-growing class of AI agents, which previously encountered difficulties accessing traditional fiat payment systems due to their lack of official registration with any nation. These, whole developers and AI agents increasingly adopt and explore these new capabilities, open for the potential and transformative impact of such an innovation to be fully realized, marking an important moment in the advancement of the crypto industry in general. In particular industry-wise, the rollout of these tools by Lightning Labs represents a major stride in the integration of AI and Bitcoin transactions. As the current capacity of the Lightning Network stands at 5,432 BTC, approximately $163.5 million, these tools provide significant opportunities for developers operating in these fields.

14653023,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=541843,1688814682,Stellar (XLM) Sheds 13% As Bearish Sentiment Takes Over,"In the past week, Stellar (XLM) experienced a decline in price, moving from $0.1 to $0.096. This represents a decrease of -13.42% in value. Furthermore, in the past 24 hours, XLM recorded a minor drop of -0.61%. These price movements indicate a slight bearish sentiment prevailing in the crypto market, with XLM being influenced by the broader market conditions. The recent downtrend in XLM’s price suggests that bears currently have the upper hand, while the scope for bullish activity appears limited. What Could Be Responsible For The Recent Price Dip? The Stellar ecosystem has been rife with developments in recent months, with the biggest being the launch of the Spacewalk bridge that connects the blockchain to Polkadot. The bridge was meant to enable smooth transfer of the USDC stablecoin between the two blockchains fostering increased utility and potential demand within Stellar’s ecosystem. However, this has not gone to plan, as Stellar’s price has failed to match the positive advancements in its ecosystem. Instead, bearish sentiment has engulfed XLM, which has contributed to the recent downward price movement. Related Reading: XRP Next Step: Here’s Why An Upward Move Could Be Likely The bearish sentiment indicates that market participants are cautious about XLM, leading to selling pressure and a lack of significant buying interest. It is important to consider the impact of market sentiment on short-term price fluctuations, as it can create challenges for price recovery and limit the potential for bullish momentum in the near term. What’s Next For Stellar (XLM)? Although XLM is currently experiencing a bearish sentiment, the long-term prospects for the cryptocurrency remain positive. Stellar’s roadmap for 2023 focuses on enhancing network utility through strategic initiatives. This includes making innovation easy and scalable through Soroban development, scaling and decentralization endeavors, and improving developer wallet tools. Stellar aims to win over builders by accelerating the growth of widely-used assets, promoting accessibility and user-friendly apps, and leveraging smart contracts for sustainable use cases in the DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Circle Intervenes, Freezes $63 Million From Multichain Hack Furthermore, Stellar’s focus on utility and building trust involves engaging in public policy, raising platform awareness, and maintaining high-quality wallet products. These initiatives are designed to strengthen Stellar’s position in the market and drive future growth. While short-term price movements may be influenced by market sentiment, the long-term success of Stellar relies on the execution of its strategic initiatives and the adoption of its network utility. As a result, XLM’s value could potentially increase in the future, with projections indicating the possibility of reaching $0.11 by 2024. Investors and traders should closely monitor the progress of Stellar’s roadmap and evaluate market conditions when considering the future prospects of XLM. At press time, XLM was trading at $0.09691 per coin with a 1-hour price increase of 1.1%. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

We believe just 25 of the top 100 tokens could potentially be considered ‘sufficiently decentralized’ to avoid the disclosure requirements of the proposed law. Presented here is our Layer 1s June 2023 Performance Overview of the Best and Worst Tokens. Bitcoin rose 12% in June as other cryptos sectors' fell, influenced by a new legislation proposal, SEC lawsuits against exchanges, and BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF filing. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Digital assets price dispersion reached extreme levels in June as Bitcoin gained 12% while every crypto sector we track fell in the month. Two principal events catalyzed the performance gap, in our view. First, on June 2nd, Patrick McHenry, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, released the Digital Asset Market Structure Proposal to establish clear guidelines for cryptocurrencies to be classified as either a security or commodity. Then, on June 5th and 6th, the SEC sued Binance ( BNB-USD ) and Coinbase ( COIN ), respectively, alleging that both operated as unregistered national securities exchanges and brokerages, that Binance commingled customer assets and named at least 13 crypto assets made available to customers that qualify as ""crypto asset securities.""

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Index performance is not representative of fund performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. These legislative and judicial clarifications are important because blockchains whose tokens are classified as securities under US law may struggle to attract developers, many of whom expect censorship resistance and decentralization. Indeed, several exchanges and market makers delisted some of the 13 coins named in the SEC suits, including large-caps Solana ( SOL-USD ), Cardano ( ADA-USD ), and Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), all of which fell more than 20% in June. Further illustrating the potential market share losses by “security” token projects, the ratio of open-source “commits” in the Ethereum ecosystem made a 12-month high relative to competing smart contract platforms, even as overall open-source blockchain developer activity plunged to yearly lows. Total Smart Contract Platform Ecosystem GitHub Commits Source: Github as of 6/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Analyzing the House Financial Services’ Digital Asset Market Structure Proposal Many open-source blockchain project participants have argued that decentralization is not binary but a spectrum comprising a handful of fluid factors, including network architecture, team makeup, and tokenomics. But the spectrum claim only applies until one faces a lawsuit. At this point, more specific distinctions are acquired. With that in mind, we took a close look at the House Financial Services’ Digital Assets Market Structure Proposal , proposed legislation which posits that if a token meets the four guidelines below, the digital asset can be considered ‘sufficiently decentralized’ and fall under the CFTC’s oversight as a digital commodity. No issuer or affiliated persons can prevent anyone from using the digital asset or operating computational infrastructure related to the blockchain network (applies to the past 12 months) No issuer or affiliated person owns or has voting rights to 20% or more of the circulating supply (past 12 months, excludes fully decentralized DAOS) No issuer or affiliated person has marketed to the public the digital asset or blockchain network (past 3 months) All issuances of digital assets have been end-user distributions (past 12 months) To clarify the legal jargon regarding the first stipulation, we interpret computational infrastructure as applied to operating nodes, validators, or anything related to blockchain architecture that requires hardware. An affiliated person is anyone who directly or indirectly controls 5% or more of the circulating supply. End User distributions refer to the process of how tokens are issued or earned. Essentially, tokens must be distributed in a non-discretionary manner that can be satisfied by any participant in the network for activities directly related to the operation of the network. This means absolutely no exchange of cash or other assets in exchange for the token. In response to the proposed legislation, we applied these guidelines to classify the top 100 tokens by market cap as either securities or commodities. We excluded stablecoins and did not consider the marketing rule since the courts could argue that any network with a Twitter account is ‘marketing.’ From our analysis, just 25 of the top 100 tokens could potentially be considered ‘sufficiently decentralized’ to avoid the disclosure requirements of the proposed law. We then analyzed the simple average and market-cap-weighted returns for the 30- and 365-days ending on June 28th.

Layer 1s June 2023 Performance Overview: Best and Worst Tokens For the fourth consecutive year, the “June Witch” emerged from the swirling waters of the cryptocurrency markets and “rekt” countless financial mariners. After the melee and subsequent decline in meme coin trading in May, June began with record low crypto volatility as Bitcoin’s implied vol sunk into the high 20s, on par. As is typical in the space, that lull did not last long, and by June 15 th the total market cap of all layer 1s smart contract platforms (SCPs) had fallen 16% to $289B. After that, the market recovered somewhat, thanks to momentum generated by Blackrock Bitcoin ETF filing, but SCPs still ended the month down 6%. For June, the best-performing tokens were Arbitrum (+3%), ETH (+3%) , and Polkadot ( DOT-USD -4%) . On the flipside, Polygon (-26%), Cardano (-26%) , and Matic (-26%) fell the most.

Arbitrum Arbitrum set a new high with 2.7 million monthly unique active addresses, becoming so popular that the chain halted for an hour on June 7th. The halt occurred when the centrally controlled sequencer ran out of ETH necessary to pay the gas fees required to post updates to Ethereum. Whether due to increased user traffic or a lack of oversight from the team, the halt was negligible, and Arbitrum experienced one of its most profitable months to date, with monthly profits of +38% to $1.29M, even as revenues (fees paid by users) declined by 54%. This is an interesting dynamic that relates to how Layer-2s business economics work. Layer-2s host separate transaction environments from Ethereum. Applications and value, in the form of tokens, operate on the L2s, and the L2s then post the history of activity to Ethereum. Because most blockchains tend to experience usership at the same time, revenues and profits for L2s can diverge. While revenues may increase because of increased activity on an L2, profit margins and even total profits can decrease. That is because the main cost to L2s, posting to Ethereum, can also increase substantially with more activity on Ethereum. In the month of June, gas fees on Ethereum were lower due to decreased activity, so the profit margins of L2 should logically increase, all else equal, because their main cost of revenue has declined. However, Arbitrum did not just have higher profit margins in June; they actually saw profits increase, meaning that the margin surge more than compensated for the decrease in revenues. This implies that there was high demand for users to transact on Arbitrum. On a relative basis, Arbitrum distinguished itself as a hub of activity versus its main competitor, Optimism ( OP-USD ). Optimism's profits and revenues decreased by 24% and 50%, respectively. Arbitrum vs Optimism Profit Margins Source: Token Terminal as of 6/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Thus, the Arbitrum ecosystem has seen a positive feedback loop, with both user base and profits rising faster than the competition. Despite announcements that Coinbase's layer 2, Base , and BNB chain's native layer 2, opBNB , will be built on the Optimism tech stack, Arbitrum has managed to increase its Total Value Locked (TVL) at a pace significantly faster than Optimism. While starting the year with roughly twice the TVL, it reached 3x OP’s TVL by July, thanks to a much more developed DeFi ecosystem. Popular Arbitrum-based DeFi projects GMX and Radiant have attracted roughly the same TVL as the Optimism ecosystem combined. The success of these applications in Arbitrum can be attributed to the generation of yield from substantial usage, which in turn attracts higher-value users in a positive flywheel.

Ethereum As the base asset by which all other tokens are compared, ETH tends to outperform in bear markets. The month of June was no exception to this general rule as ETH rose 3% while the broader index of SCPs lost just over -6%. The biggest story of the month for Ethereum was the SEC’s conspicuous omission of ETH from its list of securities in both the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits. Additionally, ETH supply dynamics have vastly improved, with supply of ETH on exchanges falling to an all-time low of 13% of total supply. Likewise, ETH staking has climbed to nearly 20% while ETH locked in smart contracts has surpassed 30%. While the ETH staking growth can be attributed to greater comfort spurred by the Shapella upgrade that allows staking withdrawals, smart contract locking can be attributed to the proliferation of yield-generating protocols using ETH and stETH (liquid token given to ETH stakers by liquid staking providers). On the horizon, many more use cases for ETH are emerging, like Eigenlayer, which will allow ETH holders to stake both on-chain and off-chain protocols with ETH. This may include things like oracles, blockchains, computation networks, bridges, and more. These new use cases will likely draw yield-seekers to lock more ETH into smart contracts, which will further diminish liquid supply. As a reminder, we tackled all of these revenue drivers in our deep-dive $11k price target for ETH. ETH Supply Dynamics Source: Etherscan.io as of 6/30/2023.

While blockchain activity on Ethereum remained robust, average ETH gas prices (gwei) sunk to their lowest level since January, 26.33 gwei, which was 64% less than May’s average, which was unusually high due to some memecoins (PEPE “the most memeable memecoins” according to its website, peaked at $1.6B market cap in May before falling to $333M in June). Still, Ethereum increased its monthly average daily active user count by 10.5%, from 328k to 363k, while maintaining its share of the layer 1 fee market above 70%.

Polkadot Breaking a long streak of monthly underperformance, Polkadot (-4%) was able to weather the June Witch a bit better than its peers. As a refresher, Polkadot is a specific type of smart contract platform, called a Layer-0, that does not directly host any smart contracts on its platform. Instead, it is called a sharded blockchain, where the functionalities of smart contracts are outsourced to other blockchains that connect to Polkadot. In return for connecting to Polkadot, these blockchains tap into the security of Polkadot and gain the ability to securely trade messages and assets with other connecting chains. This vision, which pre-dates Ethereum, essentially has solved all the current pain points experienced by Ethereum – high fees, low throughput, messaging between blockchains, and state management. Despite its promise, Polkadot has lost momentum since 2021 as network issues emerged, Polkadot’s Web3 Foundation failed to implement pro-growth policies, and a $200M bridge hack destroyed its nascent community. As a result, Polkadot, though a top 7 asset by market capitalization, is down -90% from all-time highs, while its most successful parachains tokens are down as much as -98.5%. However, despite poor price action, Polkadot still has enormous potential as it retains the second largest full-time developer community, at 775, outside of Ethereum, representing 21% of all blockchain developers. Polkadot’s outperformance in June can be partly attributed to its exclusion from the SEC’s securities lists. In mid-January, the foundation behind Polkadot, the Web3 Foundation, declared publicly that DOT was not a security. Then, at Polkadot’s annual conference in June called “ Polkadot Decoded ,” Founder Gavin Wood laid out a blockspace-centric vision for Polkadot, including: increasing transaction output capabilities by 10x, creating pay-as-you-go parachains, constructing an active blockspace market, and creating novel low-latency parachains. Another important development was Polkadot's massive change to its governing bodies called “ Open Governance ,” which democratizes and decentralizes control of Polkadot’s business, software, and economic update processes. Also contributing to the relative positive sentiment for Polkadot was the recent raise of $37M by Mythical Games , who is building a Polkadot blockchain for gaming and NFTs. Polygon Polygon (MATIC), which lost -26% in the month of June, was the worst performer amongst smart contract blockchains. The price action of Polygon was not encouraging before the month of June, as it was already one of the weakest performers YTD. Despite a slew of positive partnerships with prominent partnerships over the last year with entities like Reddit , Starbucks , Draftkings , Prada, Adidas , and others , Polygon has not seen the follow-through to its bottom line. While Polygon’s userbase, in terms of daily active users, has increased 40% since June 2022, its 3-month moving average for fees has decreased by 13%. This implies that the value of its users has simultaneously reduced, and the costs of running the chain, as Polygon must post data to Ethereum, have increased. Polygon Daily Active Users vs. Monthly Fees Source: Artemis.xyz as of 6/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Polygon’s issues increased in June when the SEC cited it as a security in the cases against Binance and Coinbase. Exacerbating matters, Polygon Labs, the entity that designed Polygon, did not directly deny the SEC’s s ) - Twiter"" target=""_blank"">assertions by curiously contending that they “did not target the US at any time.” As a result of the SEC action, both Robinhood and ICE’s Bakkt exchange announced they would delist MATIC. Furthermore, Robinhood announced that any MATIC left on its platform after June 27 would be market-sold and the customers refunded in USD. eToro also followed suit in delisting MATIC. Amid the flurry of bad news and price declines, a large MATIC holder unstaked and liquidated 115.27M MATIC ($95.71). Finally, Polygon’s future for scaling, its Layer-2 zero-knowledge project called zkEVM, is showing extremely tepid adoption compared to its main competitor zkSync Era. Polygon’s zkEVM has only 1/17th of the TVL of zkSync’s Era. TVL: Polygon zkEVM vs zkSync Era Source: Dune @tomanhh, @0vix_wizards as of 6/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

To stem the longer-term token price decline and refresh the Polygon network, Polygon has launched what it calls s ) - Twitter"" target=""_blank"">Polygon 2.0 . In their official blog posting, on June 12, they announced a series of upgrades that create “the value layer of the internet.” Implementation would consist of addressing tokenomics issues with MATIC while increasing network throughput and efficiency. The first step was announced on June 19, which was the revamp of Polygon’s main network, called Polygon PoS, to improve transaction throughput and prevent network issues that have plagued Polygon. Going forward, Polygon is set to announce changes to its token structure and new developments for its planned network of blockchains it calls Polygon “Supernets.” BNB BNB had its worst month to date this year, marked by a 23% drop in token price. This decrease was primarily driven by a combination of funds exiting the ecosystem and reduced fees generated. Over the past 30 days, the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the BNB chain declined by nearly $1B, settling at just $3.4B. This latest June TVL figure contrasts starkly with last year's figure of $5.3B and represents a 36% YoY drop. Compared to other ecosystems, in percentage terms, the decline in BNB chain’s TVL was twice as much as Optimism's and 14x as much as Ethereum's. The key trigger for the abrupt decrease in TVL was multiple government enforcement actions against the associated Binance exchange. TVL Drawdown: June 2023 Source: Artemis.xyz as of 6/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Earlier in the month, the SEC filed a lawsuit against the Binance exchange and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, for listing unregulated securities, including BNB. After the lawsuit, it also received a motion to freeze Binance's US customer assets. In Europe, Binance failed to acquire an operating license from Dutch regulators and was ordered to stop all operations in Belgium . Moreover, the number of daily active addresses has remained relatively stable over the past two months. This suggests that the decrease in TVL is not due to a collection of smaller retail users but rather larger holders managing their risk due to the close connection with Binance. Alongside the outflow of user funds, transaction-related fees and revenue have dropped by 25% over the past 30 days. Currently, 10% of BNB gas fees are burned and removed from the circulating supply, so this reduction in fees generated is a significant factor driving the recent depreciation of the token. As the price of BNB has declined, it has approached the liquidation point of a levered trader with $236M worth of BNB on Venus protocol, the top lending platform on the BNB chain. If the price of BNB drops to $218, the position will fall below its collateral requirement and can be liquidated. This would lead to a market-sell order and almost certainly trigger a large drop in the token price. Luckily for BNB holders, the situation has been alleviated with a governance proposal passing that enables the BNB ecosystem team to execute the liquidation spread over a period of time rather than one immediate transaction. Cardano Cardano, whose ADA token fell 25% in June, suffered gravely from June Witch’s wrath. The SEC lawsuit against Binance hit Cardano especially hard due to follow-on effects, including Robinhood selling off all ADA, MATIC, and SOL by June 27th. Simultaneously, Celsius also began liquidating various customer altcoins, including Cardano, by converting them into Bitcoin and Ethereum. The combined $56 million ADA held by Celsius and Robinhood represent 25% of the daily average volume for ADA (though it can be sold over a years-long winddown). Likewise, the citation by the SEC enhances the possibility of direct action by the agency against Cardano. Adding further to the downward pressure was the restructuring and layoff of staff from Cardano developer entity IOG. Coming into the month, Cardano, though buoyed by the charismatic leader Charles Hoskinson who has cultivated a diehard Cardano community, had been beset by the slow pace of functionality improvements on its platform, resulting in a lack of user share growth vs. competing blockchains. For example, Cardano has fallen below 2% of all SCP users. And while Cardano’s TVL has grown enormously since the start of the year, from $49M to $153M, it has lagged mightily behind ETH layer 2s like OP & ARB, whose combined TVL has surged by more than $1.4B. Similarly, the lack of development pace has also stunted the growth of Cardano’s DEX ecosystem, as Cardano hosts about 50% of the volumes of Optimism and about 8.5% of the activity of Arbitrum. Cardano Fails to Grow Share of Total Users Source: Artemis.xyz as of 6/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Though prices declined, Cardano has positive developments as its DEX activity, though small and lagging, continue to grow amid contract upgrades. DEX volume on Cardano increased DEX volume by 20% in June compared to May, which was the highest increase amongst comparable blockchains, as most others were negative. This activity increase resulted from Cardano’s 8.1.1 Node Upgrade, which offered significant performance improvements, enabling more DEX transaction throughput. DeFi June 2023 Updates: Ethereum Claims Larger Share in Volume The Market Vector Decentralized Finance Leaders Index fell 1% in June. The total value locked in DeFi protocols dropped 4%, with Curve and Convex recording slightly larger drops than other protocols with more than $1B TVL. MKR led DeFi tokens with a 30% end-of-month rally while UNI and AAVE each rose about 10%, YFI gained 2%, and CRV fell nearly 7% as shorts piled in mid-month to try and liquidate the founder’s CRV position on Aave. June DeFi Protocol TVL & Price Movement Source: Artemis.xyz as of 6/30/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Arbitrum and BNB are the only chains other than Ethereum enabling over 10% of decentralized exchange volume (14.5% & 16.5% in June). Next is Polygon with 5.5%. Solana, Arbitrum, and Polygon are the best chains to provide liquidity, supporting more volume relative to liquidity than other chains. But when controlling for liquidity, Arbitrum appears to be still the preferred chain to trade on, supporting about 1/3 of the weekly volume of Ethereum with only 1/6 the liquidity.

Liquidity Efficiency refers to Dex volume/Dex TVL. Some notable DeFi events in June included: Uniswap Foundation released details regarding the functionality and vision of Uniswap V4. Specifically, the plans laid out a vision for programmable liquidity strategies via “hooks” and their new singleton contract, consolidating much of the repetitive code in deploying liquidity to standardize the ecosystem development that will undoubtedly occur on top of the Uniswap framework. This could lead to increased business lines for protocols that thrive on providing users with advanced yield strategies, such as Yearn and Beefy Finance. That being said, we expect that a plethora of new applications for this framework will be discovered as the top minds in smart contract development audit the code and brainstorm the products they can build from hooks. Halfway through the month, Tether’s USDT depegged by almost 50 bps as investors feared continued SEC enforcements could eventually lead to Tether or its largest users being criminally indicted. This fear led to the Curve 3pool USDT concentration rising above 70% as investors sold their USDT. However, it soon returned to normal as investors regained conviction and arbitraged the pool back to normal. The USDT concentration in the 3pool is 34% at the time of writing. Important Governance Activity: Aave: ARFC: GHO Mainnet Launch - receiving final feedback before an AIP can be voted on by the DAO Temperature check on Integrating MakerDAO’s DSR into Aave V3 Ethereum pool - results! Uniswap: Temperature check to deploy V3 on Fantom and Filecoin’s FVM - both passed. Yearn: Activate veYFI rewards with oYFI gauges - in discussion. Synthetix: Add stETH/USD to synthetic perps - passed. Stablecoins crvUSD supply grew 340% throughout the month, from $10M to $44M at the time of writing. Additionally, fees generated from crvUSD have surpassed $125k in just a month and a half since launch. The growth can mainly be attributed to the addition of wstETH, wBTC , and wETH debt markets and the incentivized crvUSD liquidity pools that essentially allow users to be paid to take out loans. For example, many users have deposited interest-bearing collateral such as sfrxETH or wstETH, which yield 4-5% APR intrinsically, borrow crvUSD at 7-8% and deposit it in Conic Finance’s crvUSD omnipool to earn 13% from the compounded CRV emissions. Beyond incentivization, crvUSD also provides value to users through the soft liquidation method that reduces volatile asset exposure as price declines, and collateral is called and increases exposure as price moves retraces up. With the final comments rolling in on Aave ’s proposed GHO launch, we expect an AIP to be proposed and passed in July, approving GHO’s mainnet launch. Meanwhile, MakerDAO increased the DAI savings rate to 3.49% to provide DAI holders a higher risk-fee yield and the ability to hold yield-bearing DAI via the new ERC-4626 vault token, sDAI . The change prompted a reversal in DAI’s market capitalization from its mid-month low of $4.59 billion to $4.69 billion at the time of writing. Borrows on Spark increased 50% to $15m, lagging behind the growth of crvUSD partially due to less incentivization and having only a $20m debt limit. Reserve protocol ((RSP)) initiated a $20 million acquisition of Curve assets, a process that will span the summer and serve as an incentive for liquidity in their tokens. The protocol facilitates the decentralized creation of asset-backed stablecoins known as ""RTokens."" By investing in Curve assets, the Reserve team demonstrates their confidence in the long-term significance of the Curve ecosystem within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. The acquired SDT, CVX, and CRV will be locked and utilized to direct emissions toward their respective RTokens' pools. Noteworthy early investors in Reserve include Sam Altman and Peter Thiel. As the end of the month neared, stablecoin TUSD lost its peg on Binance.US, falling briefly to $0.80, and grew to over 70% concentration in its Curve liquidity pool as investors feared TUSD’s exposure to Prime Trust could make it insolvent. The reserve reports later stated a mere $26k of TUSD assets were impacted. Unlike USDT, however, the TUSD Curve pools still remain imbalanced, with the TUSD 3pool at 65% TUSD concentration at the time of writing, indicating investor fear still hasn't fully subsided. Metaverse, Gaming, & Web3 Investors had hoped for an upward trend in metaverse tokens during June due to the unveiling of Apple's latest headset, Apple Vision Pro. However, their expectations were left unfulfilled as numerous prominent metaverse tokens were classified as securities due to the SEC lawsuits targeting Coinbase and Binance within the same week. Consequently, the Market Vector Media and Entertainment Leaders Index (MVMELE) fell 22% in June, primarily driven by 4 out of 5 index components, accounting for 76% of the index's weight, being designated as unregistered securities in the SEC's latest enforcement actions ( MANA, CHZ, SAND, & AXS ). APE was the sole token in MVMELE not designated an unregistered security in SEC lawsuits. However, in June, the Yuga Labs ecosystem encountered challenges when MachiBigBrother conducted a market dump of over $1 million worth of BAYC NFTs via Blur. Moreover, Machi initiated a defamation lawsuit against well-known on-chain investigator @zachxbt for an article published in June 2022, which garnered negative reactions within the crypto community. This incident underscores the concentrated ownership of even the largest NFT collections and their influence on market movements. Additionally, the APE token staking rewards, which commenced in December and were previously highlighted in an article, likely intensified selling pressure. APE fell 28% in June. Unique active wallets interacting with the top Web3 games remained fairly stagnant in June, decreasing about 3%. Still, despite the overall lackluster activity, venture investors continue to fund projects at relatively high valuations, with Mythical Games successfully securing $37 million in funding through a Series C1 extension round. The funding was led by Scytale Digital, with participation from ARK Invest, Animoca Brands, MoonPay, and existing investors. This recent investment follows the company's previous $150 million Series C round in November 2021, led by Andreessen Horowitz, which valued Mythical Games as a ""unicorn"" at $1.25 billion. Since its launch, Mythos Chain has been steadily climbing the CryptoSlam NFT volume rankings and currently holds the 4th position in monthly NFT sales, with a total volume of $30 million. Due to the established user acquisition channels and strong investor conviction demonstrated in the recent investment round, the Mythos web3 gaming ecosystem could be web3’s breakout gaming chain. Meanwhile, as the crypto community continues to try to build decentralized social media alternatives to web 2.0 giants, one leading contender encountered a familiar obstacle in June: Damus , an emerging decentralized social media application built on Jack Dorsey's NOSTR protocol, faced the possibility of being removed from the Apple app store unless its BTC tipping functionality was eliminated. The inclusion of this tipping feature had raised concerns during Apple's App Store review process. Apple perceives these tips as in-app purchases for digital content, thereby requiring them to be processed exclusively through Apple's in-app purchase system. This action by Apple reflects their ongoing commitment to regulating user access unless they can obtain a share of economic activity through their in-app purchase system. This potential “delisting” from the app store illustrates the challenges web3 apps face in gaining adoption while further reinforcing the justification for social media apps to be built on decentralized networks in the first place. NFTs June 2023 Updates: Overall Decline in Volume In June, the aggregate volume of NFTs experienced a decline of approximately 4.5% to $706 million, as reported by CryptoSlam! Bitcoin Ordinals activity continuously declined throughout June, with volume dropping nearly 50% to $100 million. Despite reduced buying activity overall, Bitcoin remains the second-highest chain in terms of NFT volume over the past 30 days. Within the Ethereum NFT market, Blur's market share in volume grew from 69% to 75%, while Blend maintained its dominant position in the NFT lending sector with over 90% market share. BLUR investors eagerly await August 14th, when they can vote on implementing a fee for the protocol's services, which will determine Blur's ability to sustain its dominance and generate revenue. Notably, Azuki and Bored Ape Yacht Club ( B AYC) NFTs have accumulated significantly higher outstanding debts as collateral, with 6.4k ETH and 5.9k ETH outstanding, respectively. June NFT Volume Source: CryptoSlam, as of 6/30/23. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The Azuki Elementals NFT mint tripled the original Azuki supply, adding 20,000 NFTs to the existing 10,000. The collection drew criticism due to its disproportionately large supply and the lack of uniqueness in the revealed NFTs, leading many on crypto Twitter to view it as a dilutive mechanism. Consequently, the Azuki floor price plummeted by 50% following the reveal and has since stabilized around 8.5E, with Azuki Elementals trading well below their mint price of 2E at around 1.5E.

Related Reading: Recent 800 Billion Shiba Inu Dump Has Short Traders Worried – Here’s Why XRP Shows Potential For A Reversal Despite Recent Declines XRP, currently priced at $0.467053 according to CoinGecko, has experienced a marginal decline of 0.5% over the past 24 hours and a slight drop of 0.3% over the past seven days. However, despite dropping toward the $0.46 level, which serves as the lower border of a descending price channel, there are indications that a likely upward shift may be on the horizon. Up until a breakout to the upper border, which denotes a potential trend reversal, descending price channels are often bearish patterns. In line with this downward trend, XRP has been trading at regularly lower highs and lows. The currency is currently experiencing a significant decline in its value, and it is approaching the lower limit of a trading channel. This decline has created an environment that holds the potential for a potential recovery to take place. When a currency approaches the bottom border of a trading channel, it suggests that it has reached a support level, a point at which there is increased demand for the currency, which could lead to a reversal in its downward trend. XRP market cap currently at $24.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com According to an XRP price report, when a cryptocurrency reaches the lower border of a descending channel, it often signifies a critical juncture where buying pressure may overcome selling pressure, leading to a reversal in the price direction.

Compiled Etherscan data on July 7 shows that the stablecoin issuer froze $27.65 million, $30.1 million, and $5.5 million in three transactions, hampering the hacker’s cash-out efforts. Multichain Hacked, Circle Intervenes Multichain, a cross-chain protocol router, was hacked on July 7, resulting in the loss of over $126 million worth of various tokens. The exploit came after the attacker illegally accessed Multichain’s Multi-Party Computation (MPC) address, which stores funds locked between blockchains. Subsequently, the hacker withdrew funds from the address and moved them to an externally controlled wallet. The Fantom Bridge was adversely affected by this outflow as the hacker withdrew various tokens, including wBTC, USDC, and USDT. There were a handful of other altcoins that the hacker stole. Related Reading: Arbitrum DAO Locks $770 Million In ARB Tokens Into Vesting Contract: Implications For ARB Funds were also stripped from the Moonriver Bridge, with observers noting that at least $6.8 million worth of various coins, including USDC, were moved to an external address. It is also reported that an address associated with Multichain connecting with Dogecoin also lost over $600,000. The stolen USDC has now been frozen and cannot be moved, a relief for the community. However, it is not clear whether Circle will reverse funds to Multichain. In the past, Tether Holdings and Circle, the centralized issuers of the world’s most liquid stablecoins, have intervened to prevent bad actors from cashing out. Hack Compounding Multichain’s Woes, Bitcoin Firm Peckshield, a blockchain security firm, was the first to pick out the unusual transfers of over $118 million worth of assets from Multichain’s Fantom and Moonriver bridges. The firm went on to tag the team behind the cross-chain protocol, who immediately acted. In response to the hack, Multichain said the outflow was “abnormal” and halted all activity while recommending users pause their protocol and revoke all contracts approval. Related Reading: Hackers Have Stolen $30 Billion In Crypto Since 2012, SlowMist Report Finds Although the Multichain team had assured the community that the private keys controlling asset movements through the bridge are secure and stored on-chain, their technology appears to have flaws, resulting in the hack. The hack marks what has also been a tumultuous past few weeks. Besides delayed transactions and what the team described as “multiple issues,” the founder is missing. Despite the attack, Bitcoin prices are firm when writing. The coin is above the $30,000 psychological support, rejecting bear pressure from July 6. However, FTM, the native currency of Fantom, is free-falling, dumping 20% from July highs.

Major Leadership Shake-Up According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, Boiron’s appointment signals the company’s commitment to nurture and expand the global Polygon community of developers, builders, and users. Boiron, who has been with the firm since 2020, has extensive experience in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, having worked in various legal and regulatory roles. Related Reading: Hackers Have Stolen $30 Billion In Crypto Since 2012, SlowMist Report Finds Furthermore, Rebecca Rettig, who joined the company in February as chief policy officer, will assume Boiron’s former role as chief legal officer. Co-founder Sandeep Nailwal will serve as executive chairman, overseeing the company’s strategic direction and partnerships. In a tweet announcing his departure, CEO Ryan Wyatt stated: It’s bittersweet to share that I am leaving Polygon Labs at the end of the month! Marc Boiron, our Chief Legal Officer, will be stepping up & leading working closely with Sandeep Nailwal! For me, I’ll be advising Polygon, investing, & staying in the industry! More to come later. Polygon runs two of the most closely watched networks for scaling Ethereum transactions, and its rebrand to “Polygon 2.0” signals a new phase of growth and development for the company. The management changes are part of a broader restructuring effort at the blockchain firm, aimed at positioning the company for long-term success in the rapidly evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency space. The expected focus of the rebrand to “Polygon 2.0” is to expand the company’s user base and developer community and enhance the platform’s features and capabilities. This will involve a renewed focus on community-building and innovation as the company seeks to position itself for long-term success. The rebrand is expected to signal a new phase of growth and development for Polygon as it continues to run two of the most closely watched networks for scaling Ethereum transactions. Polygon 2.0 Architecture Revealed On the 29th of June, the firm already gave a hint of what to expect from Polygon 2.0. According to Polygon’s blog post, this new chapter aims to provide “unlimited” scalability and unified liquidity. The proposed architecture consists of four protocol layers, each designed to operate together and enable an important process within the network. These layers include the Staking Layer, the Interop Layer, the Execution Layer, and the Proving Layer. The Staking Layer is a Proof of Stake (PoS)-based protocol that leverages Polygon’s native token (MATIC) to provide decentralization to participating Polygon chains. Related Reading: Arbitrum DAO Locks $770 Million In ARB Tokens Into Vesting Contract: Implications For ARB On the other hand, the Interop Layer facilitates secure and seamless cross-chain messaging within the Polygon ecosystem. At the same time, the Execution Layer enables any Polygon chain to produce sequenced batches of transactions. With these developments, Polygon 2.0 is expected to offer a more robust and versatile platform that can support a wider range of use cases and applications while providing a more seamless and user-friendly experience for developers and users alike.
