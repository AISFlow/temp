42387182,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlq1R,1624652888,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Declines Into the Weekend, as Volatile Month Continues","Bitcoin traded lower on Friday as the price struggled near the $35,000 resistance level. The cryptocurrency was trading around $32,000 at press time and is down about 8% over the past 24 hours. Some analysts expect continued weakness into the weekend as a volatile month nears its end.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $31967.4, -8.27%  Ether (ETH) $1842.9, -8.45%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4280.7, +0.33%  Gold: $1779.2, +0.22%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.531%, compared with 1.492% on Thursday  Traders whipsawed    Ongoing concerns about regulatory crackdowns and environmental issues have weighed on bitcoin’s price over the past few months. The technical charts suggest further downside is likely as sellers react to extreme overbought conditions since March.      Over the short term, bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase between $30,000 support and $40,000 resistance. Oftentimes, trading ranges can be difficult to navigate for some traders.      “Chinese market participants have been massively selling during the past month alongside the Grayscale unlocking schedule leading to more selling pressure,” wrote Elie Le Rest, partner and co-founder of ExoAlpha, a crypto hedge fund, in an email to CoinDesk. Greyscale, like CoinDesk, is a unit of Digital Currency Group.      “With newcomers in the crypto market seeing their profit and capital getting wiped out by selling waves, newcomers are taking their losses as they can’t stomach this much negative volatility anymore,” wrote Le Rest.      Traders are also grappling with the potential for tighter monetary policy in the U.S. this year, which could weigh on risk assets including cryptocurrencies.      “Wall Street will have to see a couple more inflation and labor reports before having a better understanding on when the [Federal Reserve] will taper and be poised to raise interest rates,” wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in an email to CoinDesk.      “It seems it will take intensifying inflation pressures to get the dollar rally going and that might pose one of the key risks for cryptocurrencies this summer,” wrote Moya.    Institutions embrace crypto    Despite short-term price swings, institutions are gradually warming to cryptocurrencies.      Bitcoin trading volumes on the LMAX Digital spot exchange have surged over the past year. Because LMAX Digital ""facilitates trades for institutions only and already is among the leading bitcoin spot exchanges, this depicts the current institutionalization of the bitcoin market,” according to a report by Arcane Research and LMAX Digital published on Friday.      The report also mentioned that roughly 70% of the 77 institutional investors surveyed by LMAX Digital expect asset managers, funds and banks to be the most significant contributors to trading volume in the next three years.      However, several gaps remain, which could slow the pace of widespread institutional adoption. “Access to banking has been particularly highlighted by brokers, while proprietary trading firms and HFT [high frequency trading] firms see access to credit as a big gap. Notably, corporates see a lack of global regulation as a major concern,” according to LMAX Digital.    Bitcoin hashrate declines    It appears that China’s regulatory crackdown has accelerated the decline in bitcoin’s hashrate over the past month. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on the blockchain.      Bitcoin's mean hashrate has dropped to 104 EH/s, the lowest level since June 2020, according to data from Glassnode. BitOoda, a digital asset financial services platform, predicted the target hashrate would be around 105 EH/s at the next difficulty reset, which will likely happen on July 3, while the target hashrate will drop further to 85 EH/s at the subsequent difficulty reset on July 19 or July 20.      Chinese miners have been looking for hosting sites for potential migration. “We're seeing a ton of inbound requests from China-based mining companies that are looking to relocate to North America and are looking to do it urgently,” Dave Perrill, CEO of crypto mining colocation company Compute North, told CoinDesk.    Altcoin roundup  High gas fees have plagued Ethereum off and on for months, so much so, that there has been a boom in funding and uptake around layer 2 solutions such as Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism. A new project is taking a different tack and hoping to foster better communication between two groups of Ethereum stakeholders whose incentives are often misaligned: miners and users. The Ethereum Eagle project (EGL), launching Friday, is trying to provide a signaling mechanism for the miners and community to strike the “right” balance between gas limits and block size.

In the interview, Minerd said that investors shouldn’t be “anxious to be putting money in bitcoin right now"" and predicted that bitcoin could spend the next few years trading sideways before the market turns bullish again.      In December, Minerd told Bloomberg that his firm’s fundamental analysis put bitcoin at $400,000. Just weeks after that in January, he told CNBC that there wasn’t enough institutional demand to support bitcoin’s then-all-time-high of $41,000 and that it could retrace to $20,000. In early February, he gave CNN his highest price target for bitcoin yet: $600,000.      In November, shortly before Minerd’s first bullish price prediction, Guggenheim filed an amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to be able to invest up to almost $500 million in bitcoin through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is a unit of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.      In May, Minerd tweeted: “Crypto has proven to be Tulipomania” – a reference to the Dutch tulip bulb market bubble in the 1600s, when the market crashed after a period of speculation.

42387186,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlq2h,1624648519,How One Fund Used the Carry Trade to Beat Bitcoin,"While the crypto market picture has turned decidedly bleak in the second quarter, a $130 million crypto hedge fund headed by a Wall Street veteran claims it has continued to fare well, thanks to price discrepancies in the spot and derivatives markets.      ""Our quant fund is now up 78%, having begun the second quarter at 62%,"" LedgerPrime's chief investment officer, Shilliang Tang, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Cash and carry strategies have worked well during this quarter's sell-off.""      This is in contrast to bitcoin, which lost most of its triple-digit year-to-date gains as it dropped to lows below $30,000 on June 22.    How the carry trade works    Carry trading, or cash and carry arbitrage, is a market-neutral strategy that exploits inefficiencies in the spot and the futures market. It combines a long position in the spot market and a short position in futures when the market is in contango – a condition where the future prices of an underlying asset are higher than the current spot price. As expiration nears, the premium evaporates; on the day of the settlement the futures price converges with the spot market price, generating relatively riskless returns.      Carry traders make money irrespective of the market trend, although the return depends on how steep is the contango. Bitcoin futures usually offer a substantially higher carry yield than their fiat currency counterparts, most of which yield less than 5%, according to a JPMorgan report published on April 7.      The situation was more pronounced during the height of the bull run in mid-April when bitcoin hit a record high above $64,800, lifting the premium on June futures to 25% on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The quarterly futures traded a much higher premium of around 40% on other non-regulated exchanges such as Binance or Huobi, per data source Skew.      Read more: Traders Opting for Cash and Carry Strategy as Bitcoin’s ‘Contango’ Widens      So, traders could have locked in an annualized profit of 40% in mid-April by buying bitcoin in the spot market and selling the quarterly futures contract, which expired Friday.      Several trading firms employed carry strategies back then, as reported by CoinDesk, and may have squared off positions early after the mid-May crash. That, in turn, may have been the catalyst which pushed down June futures premium to less than 10% on significant exchanges.      Carry trades are closed by selling the bitcoin holding and buying back the short futures position or allowing it to expire.      Often traders borrow stablecoins such as tether (USDT) to finance the long leg of the strategy. That tends to have a bearing on the net yield generated by the carry trade.      In the second half of April, the annualized cost of borrowing tether on the decentralized finance protocol Compound was around 8%. Assuming traders borrowed USDT to purchase bitcoin in the spot market, holding the carry strategy until the June 25 expiry would have generated a net yield of about 32% in annualized terms (return of 40% from cash and carry minus tether's borrowing cost of 8%).    Going long convexity    ""You can buy the spot with borrowed funds or just buy it outright, but short futures in both cases,"" said LedgerPrime’s Tang, a former volatility trader at Bank of America and UBS.      While cash and carry arbitrage was Tang's favored strategy in the second quarter, the fund focused on trading relatively cheap out-of-the-money (OTM) options during the first quarter.      ""Long convexity trades worked the best during the first quarter bull run,"" Tang said.      In finance, convexity refers to non-linearity, meaning that if the price of the underlying asset changes, the resulting change in the cost of the derivative is non-linear. In other words, instead of a linear relationship between the long position and its return, the trader receives a multiple of the linear return.      For example, assume a certain stock is currently trading at $100, and a trader owns a $120 call expiring in September. The option will start gaining value as the market moves higher. However, often with a big move, the overall demand for options picks up, boosting volatility. That, in turn, adds to options value, resulting in outsized gains.      ""Those tail [call] options were cheap, in our opinion, when bitcoin first broke through $20,000,"" said Tang. In plain English, the fund took long positions in call options at strikes well above $20,000 after bitcoin established a foothold above that level at the turn of the year.      Read more: Key Indicator Shows Capital Beginning to Flow Back Into Bitcoin      Bitcoin rallied by over 100% to $58,000 in the first quarter and peaked above $64,000 on April 14. On that day, the U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase debuted on Nasdaq.      While LedgerPrime switched the strategy in the second quarter, some traders continued to pile into cheap call options at $80,000 in hopes for a continued bull run. Those options are now well out-of-the-money.      Overall, the derivative market has cooled in the wake of the price crash, as excess bullish leverage has exited the market. Further, carry trades are no longer attractive.      Instead, some may look to take on another bet: selling options, which can be quite risky as the maximum return is limited to the extent of premium paid, while losses can be significant.      ""The carry trade has no premium anymore,"" Tang noted. ""Option implied volatilities are still high, so there’s still yield to be harvested there by selling calls and puts, or strangles, if we think the market is going to consolidate around these levels.""",NEUTRAL,USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/25/how-one-fund-used-the-carry-trade-to-beat-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/401e2ccd1fd7decd159f09d38b4664eed6b005d8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434620,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsJdh,1624645189,This Token Could Bridge the Incentive Gap Between Ethereum Miners and Ethereum Users,"High gas fees have plagued Ethereum off and on for months, so much so that there has been a boom in funding and uptake around layer 2 solutions such as Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism.      A new project is taking a different tack and hoping to foster better communication between two groups of Ethereum stakeholders whose incentives are often misaligned: miners and users.      The Ethereum Eagle project (EGL), launching Friday, is an effort to provide a signaling mechanism for the miners and community to strike the “right” balance between gas limits and block size.      “The idea for EGL comes from the fact that we constantly see, every six months on Twitter, people are ranting about the gas limit,” said bloXroute Head of Strategy and Operations Eleni Steinman. BloXroute, a blockchain scalability company that focuses on providing scaling without protocol changes, is developing the project.      In Ethereum, miners have the ability to determine block size, to a certain extent. Miners can change the block size of a subsequent block by 0.1%; so while there are small fluctuations back and forth in the gas limit over time, the general baseline is the gas limit set by the majority of the hash power. But Ethereum miners can change the gas limit in large movements as well.      Basically, larger blocks create lower gas fees but less profits for miners, while smaller blocks create higher gas fees and are more profitable.      Giving mining pools control over block size has caused incentives between miners and users to be decoupled, bloXroute contends.      “Lower gas limit (and higher gas fees) means more short-term income for miners, and adjusting the gas limit up generally translates to earning less, without clarity when the demand will make up for it,” the project wrote in a blog post laying out the EGL project in more detail, adding:    “A higher gas limit may push Ethereum to require more than the average consumer PC to run a node, preventing regular users from running their own node. This is an incentive and a ‘pricing’ problem, and it requires a solution to allow Ethereum to continue its growth safely.”    The boom in decentralized finance (DeFi), not to mention non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has contributed to high gas fees that can make transacting on Ethereum prohibitively expensive for many users.    What EGL does    Steinman said the EGL solution has three parts.      First, anyone with Ethereum can participate in EGL by staking ETH.      The staked ETH is used to give value to EGL tokens, with EGL’s value increasing the more ETH that gets staked. There is a hard cap of 4 billion EGL.      For example, according to Steinman, if 10,000 ETH is staked and 750 million EGL is used to match, then 1 ETH equals 75,000 EGL. If it's 20,000 ETH staked, then 1 ETH equals 37,500 EGL, implying a higher value.      EGL having value from the get-go is a key piece of the puzzle, since the token will be used to incentivize behavior among Ethereum miners.      “We're not raising money for this. It's purely for the Ethereum community,” said Steinman.      The second part is that people who hold EGL gets to vote every week on what they think is the right gas limit. A weighted average of those votes and numbers gets passed, and as miners mine blocks that match this gas limit they get rewarded in EGL.      “That allows the community to coordinate among themselves about what they think the right gas limit answer is,” said Steinman. “If you want to rant on Twitter and get people to vote with you, you actually need to have good research to have people put their money where your mouth is, but now you have a mechanism to get miners to follow what the community wants because we're rewarding them in the EGL token.”      The third part here, according to bloXroute co-founder and CEO Uri Klarman, is that there is only a carrot, no stick. Miners are not penalized if they choose not to go with a suggested gas limit; they’re only rewarded for doing so.      It’s an incentive that had not existed previously, said Klarman. “Because the closer they follow the desired gas limit, the more EGLs they get.”    Attention hack?    But how do you draw the attention and participation of the large actors that matter in the Etherum ecosystem?      To that end, the Eagle project has set parameters that, for a weekly vote to pass, a minimum threshold of staked EGL must be met. If it misses that threshold, the desired gas limit does not remain static, but rather shifts to 5% less than the “desired” gas limit that was up for consideration.      The idea here is that if people continue to not vote, the gas limit slowly slips further and further below what voters indicate they want, and the community ends up back where it was in the first place, with low gas limits and high fees.      “By launching EGLs with clear value from genesis, miners are incentivized to want to earn free EGLs,” said Steinman. “Knowing this, holders will want to vote and affect the gas limit since miners are incentivized to listen.”      There will certainly be challenges to a model such as this gaining traction, according to Compass Mining Editorial Director Will Foxley.      “The social layer is the hardest part of any crypto-project, and historically the relationship between Ethereum miners and developers has proven to be one of the more contentious in the ecosystem,” he said in a message. “Most developers recognize the way block sizes work in Ethereum is a net negative for the space, but fixing it remains difficult.”      Foxley is skeptical that a token can fix what amounts to an engineering issue on the Ethereum base layer. He said It's hard to see mining pools respecting token votes or Ethereum developers using the token.    Eth 2 questions    Ethereum 2.0, the network’s proof-of-stake overhaul, is on the horizon, and Eagle says it could remain relevant when Ethereum miners cease to be a thing.      Eagle’s blog post says the gas limit concerns will shift from miners to validators with a proof-of-stake model. With that, the “proper” or “right” gas limit will shift from centralized mining pools to more decentralized validator operators, only accentuating the need for a tool such as EGL.      “It seems unclear at the moment if Eth 2 will fix this issue by moving block size adjustments to validators,” said Foxley. “Most validators are staking with exchanges, so it's likely that exchanges become block size arbiters rather than miners. Of course, much of this remains to be seen.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | MINING | ARB,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/25/this-token-could-bridge-the-incentive-gap-between-ethereum-miners-and-ethereum-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bc70e001671729f1c59fb0756b0d33a1bc20779-1500x1126.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434632,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsJxh,1624639713,Money Reimagined: Price Swings Versus the Long Term,"Volatility is the defining feature of crypto investing. The past few months – with yet more whipsawed price action creating and then quickly destroying hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth – have provided a reminder of that. But despite these stomach-churning moves, money is flowing into crypto projects like never before. As we discuss below, perhaps it’s because this volatility problem has become a “known known” that investors simply factor into their valuation metrics.      One field of projects that has seen a boom is interoperability protocols, which tackle the big problem of getting different blockchains to talk to each other and enable cross-chain asset transfers without relying on a centralized intermediary.      In this week’s “Money Reimagined” podcast, Sheila Warren and I talk to two leaders in this space: Denelle Dixon, CEO of the Stellar Development Foundation, and Peng Zhong, CEO of Tendermint, who develops the Cosmos “blockchain of blockchains.”      Have a listen after reading the newsletter.    50% swings are mere flesh wounds    Spring is supposed to be a period of rebirth and growth. Not so in Cryptoland this year.      In a direct reversal of its spectacular gains through the winter, bitcoin dropped a painful 52% from its March 20 equinox peak to its summer solstice trough this past Monday.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Ether had a better first half of the spring, rallying from $1,800 on March 20 to an all-time high of $4,382 on May 11. But then it lost almost all of those gains in the following 40 days. Ether is currently trading at $1,854.      Meanwhile, during the same spring period, non-fungible token (NFT) auctions went from mind-blowing eight-figure digital art sales to a trickle of low-value deals.      What does this stark reversal of fortunes portend?      A consolidation to a lower base that will allow new buyers to come in and bid prices higher?      The start of another 2018-like quiet phase in which prices stagnate for a year or more while crypto developers continue to work on new projects?      Or something more ominous, such as legendary short-seller Michael Burry’s warning of the “mother of all crashes” that will see retail investors suffer losses “the size of countries?”      I don’t know the answer. If I did … well, you know how the line goes.      What I can say is we’ve been served another useful reminder that volatility is an ever-present feature of cryptocurrency markets.      Volatility goes with the territory. The development of any highly disruptive technology, especially one that, much like the internet, aspires to achieve global adoption rather than just a niche role in the economy, will breed ups and downs in prices.      The good news is that even as prices get walloped, investors with multi-year time horizons seem to be getting more comfortable with this reality and continue to place long-term bets on the industry.    Crypto stability is impossible    I’ve always thought it unfair that economists dismiss bitcoin as too volatile to ever become a useful medium of exchange.      If that’s the case, there will never be an alternative to fiat currencies, as any new monetary technology would have to achieve mass adoption (and price stability) at the very instance of its introduction to society.      To be sure, cryptocurrencies lack the compulsion power that governments hold with taxation, which means they must pass through the same “Rogers Adoption Curve” that all new technologies confront. Introduced in Everett Rogers’ 1953 book “Diffusion of Innovations,” the bell curve starts with a small group of innovators, followed by a somewhat larger group of early adopters, who make way for the early majority and late majority occupying the middle and later half of the curve, before it moves to the laggards in the right-hand tail.      That process can be relatively smooth for technologies that aren’t directly tied to liquid assets. But if there’s any chance to speculate on the adoption curve’s progress, the prices associated with those assets will inevitably see exaggerated gains and retracements, independently of the progress of the tech itself.      Case in point: The late-nineties dot-com bubble and bust, when excitement around the internet’s otherwise truly disruptive potential, pushed prices far ahead of what was then the online industry’s ability to monetize itself.      Crypto tech is especially prone to such big swings.      For one, as mentioned, it must be very widely adopted to achieve its true impact on the world. That means it’s on an especially long journey to eventual widespread acceptance and the stability that will come with that.      Also, the prospective disruption is so vast that many crypto investors assume huge future returns in their investment models. The resultant high valuations in turn attract waves of momentum-driven, FOMO-suffering retail investors who collectively drive excessive price gains that are unsustainable over the medium term.      What’s more, that vast disruptive potential inevitably creates a clash with the vested interests of the existing financial system and with their stewards in government.      The potential changes pose a challenge to the regulatory framework of the existing financial system, which in turn generates policy risk and encourages people with significant influence to feed negative narratives against the technology in response to its ascendence. It’s no coincidence the spring sell-off was accompanied by a regulatory backlash in China and by criticism of bitcoin’s environmental impact by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and political leaders such as U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren.      And let’s not forget this past year has also seen unprecedented monetary expansion by central banks, which means inordinate amounts of money poured into speculative assets such as crypto.      All these factors ensure that booms, bubbles, busts and bankruptcies are unavoidable at times like this.    Invest during the downturn    Twice previously, in 2014 and 2018, crypto showed the bursting of a bubble does not signal the failure of the technology itself. As with investors in internet technologies who shrugged off the dot-com era’s ups and downs, diehard crypto investors have been convinced there will continue to be future money-making opportunities if they stick with it.      There’s also evidence these lessons have been learned by a new breed of deep-pocketed mainstream institutions.      On his ""The Breakdown” podcast for CoinDesk on Wednesday, Nathaniel Whittemore listed a slew of major investments by venture capital firms, institutional investors, corporations and celebrity investors in crypto projects. A small sampling: Fox Entertainment investing $100 million into an NFT project; DeFi blockchain Solana raising $314 million; BitDAO’s $230 million; Goldman Sachs partnering with digital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital; BBVA opening bitcoin trading and custody services in Switzerland; State Street’s new cryptocurrency division; Visa and PayPal joining a $300 million fund raised by Blockchain Capital; hardware wallet Ledger’s $380 million raise.      And that was before Thursday’s news that venture capital behemoth Andreessen Horowitz had raised a whopping $2.2 billion for its third crypto fund.      In a similar vein, during a panel discussion I moderated at a conference hosted by the Association for Digital Asset Market Tuesday, both Thejas Nalval, co-founder and chief investment officer at Parataxis Capital, and Brad Koeppen, head of trading at CMT Digital, cited serious incoming interest in bitcoin from investors with long time horizons, such as family offices and university endowments. These investors are now educated about the volatility, they said, and have figured out how to structure it into their portfolios.      The more that “old money” comes in, the more it will – eventually – foster some degree of stability. Also, the availability of futures and more sophisticated derivative products allows these institutions to better hedge risk, which, in turn, tends to moderate price movements over time.      Still, the roller coaster continues. If you’re looking for a steady-as-she-goes investment, get yourself some T-bills. For the time being, crypto investing will require a strong stomach.    Off the charts: Speaking of volatility    The middle of May saw a spike in options volatility – a measure of expectations for price turbulence that determines the cost of buying the kind of price protection that options provide – to very high levels. At-the-money (ATM) one-month volatility surged to 150% on an annualized basis.      Then, on May 24, after the measure had eased to 123%, still well above the historical average of about 75%, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole spotted an interesting trend. Options traders were taking advantage of the higher prices for their derivatives to offer more puts – an options contract that gives the buyers the right to sell an asset at a given price in the future. This was a sign they were more relaxed about the prospect of turbulence where prices were dropping and they would be on the hook for it.      With that past in mind, I thought it would be interesting to look at what happened to volatility in recent days, following the second-leg sell-off in bitcoin that culminated Tuesday in the spot price dropping below $30,000 for the first time since late January. Here’s what CoinDesk Research’s Shuai Hao whipped up for me, using data from Skew.      That third-highest peak you see on the right side of the chart is that surge in annualized ATM implied volatility to 150% seen in May. The latest activity shows a smaller spike to around 110% earlier this week, which seems to have quickly subsided back below 100% as the bitcoin price recovered Wednesday and Thursday.      So, although we’re still above the 75% average, this suggests that expectations for big price swings haven’t been as drastically affected by the latest price declines as they were in May. It also suggests that options traders who sold those puts back then, while no doubt unhappy the spot price fell as low as it did, aren’t suffering extreme losses.    The conversation: Black Swan wars    The bitter falling out between influential theorist Nassim Taleb, he of “The Black Swan” fame, and his former colleague Saifedean Ammous, for whom Taleb wrote a foreword to the first edition of Ammous’s “Bitcoin Standard” during a happier time in their relationship, just got worse. That’s because Taleb this week landed a six-page paper in which he explained in highly critical terms why he had gone back on his earlier enthusiasm for bitcoin and now, essentially, considers it useless. Ammous’s response to the paper said it all.      Taleb’s attack, in which he essentially argued that bitcoin should be currently priced at zero because of a supposed expectation that at some point in the future there will be no miners mining it, stirred rebuttals from many bitcoiners. Here’s an interesting rhetorical takedown of Taleb’s logic by University of Wyoming philosophy professor Bradley Rettler:      But perhaps more intriguing than the predictable backlash from bitcoiners was this critique (and the responses it elicited) from someone with a truly balanced – in parts quite critical – view of bitcoin: Cato Institute monetary historian George Selgin.      It’s clear, though, that some people were swayed by Taleb’s argument, and they, too, tended to come from the anti-bitcoin category. Here’s Joe Kelly, whose profile describes him as a “Bitcoin heretic.”    Relevant reads: Venture investors    As we mentioned up top, there’s been an inordinate amount of long-term investment in crypto from big-name players of late, both in venture deals and in in-house development. It stands in striking contrast to the doldrums in the crypto market. The stories highlighted from CoinDesk here are merely from Thursday, but these kinds of announcements have been coming for weeks.    So, earlier in the day, venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, announced it had raised $2.2 billion for its third crypto fund. As Zack Seward reports, the news suggests this is a good time to be raising crypto funds.  Shortly after the a16z news, Tanzeel Akhtar reported that Citigroup’s wealth management division had launched a “digital assets group” to service clients “interested in all aspects of the digital asset space” such as cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFT), stablecoins and central bank digital currencies.  Meanwhile, blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis announced that it had closed yet another $100 million round of financing, this one putting the firm at a valuation of $4.2 billion. As Zack Seward reported, this follows a separate $100 million Series D financing round in May and brings the firm’s total fundraising tally to $365 million.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Michael J.

42434613,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsJRh,1624638167,El Salvador’s Bitcoin Fee Problem (and Solutions),"There were two big pieces of news yesterday out of El Salvador, which – let’s all say it again – will become the first country in the world to treat bitcoin as legal tender. First, the Central American country set a Sept. 7 date for the activation of its new currency. In the course of the announcement, President Nayib Bukele clarified that “the use of bitcoin will be optional,” which may reassure those concerned about any coercive elements of the law.      Even more interesting was the announcement early this morning that El Salvador will be distributing about $30 worth of bitcoin to any citizen who activates a new state-backed crypto wallet called Chivo. It’s a serious incentive in a country where per-capita income is about $4,000 per year.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    But the amount might invite skepticism if you’ve been paying attention to bitcoin metrics in recent months. In April, the average fee for a single bitcoin transaction peaked at just short of $63. Fees were at or near $30 for two weeks in late April, during which time $30 in a bitcoin wallet would have been prohibitively slow or expensive to use for anything.      On-chain fees have since dropped in dollar terms to under $7 – manageable, though still historically high. Bitcoin fees fluctuate because they’re effectively set by a bidding process for block space. During periods of high price volatility like April, speculators who need to move coins fast can bid prices way up. Even in more stable times, on-chain BTC average fees range from 50 cents up to $2 to send any amount of money, which is very affordable relative to fees from global remittance providers like Western Union, but still too much for smaller, day-to-day payments in a poor country. (Credit card fees in the U.S. are roughly 2%, which, to be clear, is itself pretty nuts.)      On-chain transaction fees have often been leveraged as a critique of bitcoin. At the systemic level, of course, that’s absurd, as fees are based on competitive bids. Saying “bitcoin fees are too high, look how much people are paying!” is the logical equivalent of Yogi Berra’s famous quip about a popular New York restaurant: “Nobody ever goes there anymore – it’s too crowded.”      That said, fee competition between low-income and high-income users seems like a real issue. Luckily, users in El Salvador will have two mitigating options.      Most importantly, El Salvador’s bitcoin development partner, Jack Mallers’ Strike, offers low-fee bitcoin payments through the Lightning Network. Lightning is a “layer two” solution, built on top of and settling to the Bitcoin blockchain, but offering BTC transactions costing just fractions of a cent. For bitcoin to work as a day-to-day payments tool, Lightning, or something like it, is a necessity.    Read more: Article 7 and Bitcoin’s Latin American Coup | George Selgin    Remittances are a slightly different story. One of the interesting and lesser-known features of the Bitcoin network is that you can choose your payment fee based on how fast you’d like a transaction settled: high-fee transactions are picked up first, but lower fee offers usually get into a block within a few hours. So for remittances, which can sometimes be less urgent than retail payments, that’s a second option.      This does raise a bunch of new questions about the El Salvador program, particularly from an educational perspective. Users in the country will have to make a new set of fairly complicated decisions about how to transact, and they deserve to have the options laid out clearly. You can be sure CoinDesk will be watching Strike and El Salvador’s progress closely.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,David Z.

Paul Prager, chairman and CEO of TeraWulf, will hold the same positions in the new company.  Ikonics (NASDAQ:IKNX) investors will receive $5 in cash and one share in the new company for each share they hold. Ikonics stock closed at $11.30 on Thursday.  They will also receive one contingent value right (CVR). The CVRs, which won't be publicly traded, entitle them to 95% of the proceeds from a sale of Ikonics' imaging business and will expire after 18 months.  TeraWulf aims to mine bitcoin with over 90% zero-carbon energy. It has more than 60,000 mining machines on order, giving it 50 megawatts of mining capacity. It expects that to grow to 800 MW by 2025, enabling a hashrate of more than 23 EH/s, which means the machines will be able to compute more than 23 quadrillion calculations per second.

The announcement comes days after Damon Dash, one of the co-founders of Roc-A-Fella Records along with Jay-Z and Kareem Burke, was sued for allegedly trying to sell the copyright of “Reasonable Doubt” as an NFT.      In its lawsuit, Roc-A-Fella Records claims Dash doesn’t own the rights to the album, because he owns only one-third of the record label and so the rights aren’t his to sell.      Dash walked back his claims after the suit, countering that he was actually trying to sell his entire stake in Roc-A-Fella as an NFT, according to TMZ. It’s unclear exactly what that means.      A Sotheby's representative told CoinDesk this project had been in the works for the past few weeks.      “It’s fitting that JAY-Z’s pioneering lyrical brilliance is commemorated through the iconic vision of acclaimed artist Derrick Adams in a bold new medium,"" Cassandra Hatton said in a statement. ""The release of Heir to the Throne marks the continued influence of Reasonable Doubt and its deep legacy of cultural importance.”      “Reasonable Doubt,” which was released in 1996, is widely seen as one of the greatest rap albums of all time. The NFT is meant to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the album's release.      “My portraits aim to capture the sensibility, optimism and beauty of urban life, and in JAY’s work I’ve found tremendous kinship,” Adams said in a statement.      A portion of proceeds from the sale will benefit the Shawn Carter Foundation, an organization bearing the rapper’s name that provides scholarships to low-income students. Bidding will start at $1,000.      The auction will also be available virtually in the Sotheby’s gallery in Decentraland.      Sotheby’s will accept cryptocurrency (ETH and BTC) as a payment option. Sotheby’s crypto purchases are facilitated through Coinbase Commerce.

42395288,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASYKqH,1624625223,FATF Says Majority of Countries Still Haven’t Implemented Watchdog’s Crypto Guidance,"The majority of countries overseen by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) have yet to put in place its requirements for firms that handle cryptocurrencies.  Speaking Friday on the occasion of its second 12-month review of progress on crypto regulation, the intergovernmental anti-money laundering (AML) watchdog said so far, 58 out of 128 reporting jurisdictions have implemented its revised standards.  Of those, 52 are regulating virtual asset service providers (VASPs), and six are prohibiting the operation of VASPs.  Implementing regulations built for traditional finance on pseudonymous-by-design crypto has been challenging. That said, it’s been over two years since the FATF announced crypto would come under its AML rules, and the regulator is now asking stragglers to get their houses in order.  The private sector was praised for its progress in developing technology to implement the FATF's “travel rule,” which requires companies to identify and share data on those involved in crypto transactions over a certain amount.  “However, the majority of jurisdictions have not yet implemented the FATFs requirements, including the ‘travel rule,’” the FATF said in a press statement. “This disincentivizes further investment in the necessary technology solutions and compliance infrastructure.”  The gaps in implementation, the FATF said, mean there are not yet global safeguards to prevent the misuse of VASPs for money laundering or terrorist financing, leading to “jurisdictional arbitrage.”  The role played by cryptocurrencies in ransomware, much in the news of late, also got a mention.  “The report also identifies potential future FATF actions to prevent the misuse of virtual assets for criminal activities, including by placing emphasis on actions to help mitigate the risk of ransomware-related virtual asset use,” the FATF said.  In March, the FATF issued draft guidance that included additional wording on decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins. It has received so much feedback on that, the organization said it won't make the VASP rules final until its next plenary meeting in October.  “This revised guidance will help assist jurisdictions and the private sector to implement the revised standards as a priority,” the FATF said.",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/25/fatf-says-majority-of-countries-still-havent-implemented-watchdogs-crypto-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a13ee2eeabed90703b7822b3724e12467acf0a9-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The browser is making the Celo Dollar (cUSD) and Celo Euro (cEUR) stablecoins available in its crypto wallet along with Celo’s native CELO token. Celo is an open-source blockchain network focused on making decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and tools more accessible. In its early days, Celo was often compared with Libra, the cryptocurrency created by Facebook.      “Stablecoins aren’t subject to market fluctuations,” Cuautemoc Weber, Opera’s head of crypto, said in an email. “It’s been a goal of Opera’s to make blockchain technologies as widespread and easily accessible as possible. We’ve been following this strategy for many years now with our built-in crypto wallet and Web3 support across Opera browsers.”      Weber said cUSD was a great fit, because people can use it as an alternative to fiat in emerging markets.      There are currently 191,763 holders of cUSD and 243 holders of the newly launched cEUR, according to Celo’s blockchain explorer. At present, cUSD has a market capitalization of $51 million, a fraction of the $100 billion stablecoin market.    Celo crescendo    Opera also joined the Celo Alliance for Prosperity, a group of more than 140 organizations “fostering social impact and financial inclusion through the use of blockchain technology.”      “Larger corporations are paying attention to the crypto user experience and how to incorporate crypto into people’s daily lives,” Chuck Kimble, head of the alliance at cLabs (which works on Celo), said in an email.      Opera users can now send peer-to-peer remittances, trade, or convert to Celo’s native asset or stablecoins from Opera’s wallet through the Ramp protocol.      “Opera’s focus on key growth markets, in particular the U.S. and EU, Africa, Southeast Asia and LATAM, will enable these mobile-savvy communities to interact with Celo assets and the Celo ecosystem with ease,” Celo co-founder Rene Reinsberg said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/25/opera-browser-adds-first-stablecoins-to-native-wallet-cusd-ceur,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee8018217cd663bf10272d6868bc912271513123-1481x806.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434625,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsJjh,1624620451,Key Indicator Shows Capital Beginning to Flow Back Into Bitcoin,"An indicator that has historically marked major price bottoms is pointing to a renewed flow of capital into bitcoin.      The stablecoin supply ratio oscillator created by analyst Willy Woo and tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode has risen from a 12-month low of -2.6 to -1.9 in the past four weeks.      The recovery indicates capital has been flowing from stablecoins into bitcoin, Glassnode tweeted Thursday. In other words, bargain hunters look to have employed stablecoins to buy the dip in bitcoin and broader crypto markets.      Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with value tied to an external reference like the U.S. dollar. They are essentially proxies for fiat currencies, offering a price-stability advantage that other digital assets do not have, and are widely used to fund crypto purchases. The total market capitalization of stablecoins has surged 10-fold year-over-year to more than $100 billion, according to Messari.      The stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) is the ratio of the bitcoin supply and the stablecoin supply denoted in BTC. ""When the ratio is low, the buying power for bitcoin is high, as the same amount of USD can buy relatively more BTC. Conversely, a high ratio means fiat has weak buying power,"" Glassnode said in the explainer blog post.      The stablecoin supply ratio oscillator helps traders identify extreme readings on the SSR and any impending trend change. The metric, however, doesn't consider the fiat-based trades or bitcoin derivatives and is not a perfect indicator.      Nevertheless, it has proved to be a reliable indicator of changes in the past.      For example, bitcoin's previous bull runs, including the one seen in the final quarter of 2020, kicked off with a below -2 reading on the oscillator. So, the recent recovery could be a signal of an impending change of fortunes for bitcoin and broader crypto markets.      Bitcoin is currently trading near $33,560, representing a 3% drop on the day. The leading cryptocurrency fell sharply in mid-May and has been restricted mainly to the $30,000 to $40,000 range ever since, barring the temporary dip to $29,000 earlier this week.

The aim is for the proposed regulation to be ready by the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022, Cinco Dias said.  The document also stipulates that businesses offering crypto services in the EU must have a base in the bloc.  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) won't be covered by the regulation because, unlike cryptocurrencies, they are not used as a medium of exchange, an indication of how the EU needs to be clear about the definition of crypto assets.  Banks looking to work with crypto assets would have preference in obtaining authorization, while investment service companies would have to ""start from scratch on an application,"" according to Cinco Dias.

The world's most valuable crypto is currently up over 5% on a 24-hour basis and is changing hands for around $34,294, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Most other cryptocurrencies in the top 20 by market value are up between 2% and 17% over the same 24-hour period, with dogecoin posting the strongest daily gains.      Despite being rangebound between $30,000 and $41,000, the jump in bitcoin's price coincides with announcements made by El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, who spoke during a national address on Thursday evening.      Bukele told his country's citizens they would be able to receive $30 in bitcoin once they sign up for the Chivo e-wallet using facial recognition. The president also said his country's controversial Bitcoin Law would come into effect on Sept 7.      Though the case may be presented as a major boon for bitcoin in the short term, long-term shadows, such as China's anti-crypto crackdowns and the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish tilt toward interest rates, continue to linger.      Meanwhile, traditional markets, which have oftentimes correlated with bitcoin's price moves, posted stronger gains over positive news involving a bipartisan Senate group, comprising five Republicans and five Democrats, and U.S. President Joe Biden.

Taylor promoted the Paragon ICO on social media in 2017, alongside Jessica VerSteeg, a former beauty queen from Iowa, who is yet to be found and has remained inactive from social media for over two years.      It is alleged Paragon raised $12 million in unregistered digital assets during its Paragon (PRG) token sale Aug. 15 through Oct. 15, 2017, and deceived investors on a promise of ludicrous returns.      ""Upon consideration of Plaintiffs’ renewed motion, the Court is persuaded the allegations are sufficient to show that Taylor acted for his own gain or for Paragon’s gain and, thus, could be considered a statutory seller,"" the document shows.      The latest judgment was handed down by magistrate Jeffrey S. White in the U.S. Northern District Court of California where the class-action was initially filed by disgruntled investors last year, claiming the company had violated U.S. securities.      Paragon is an entity set up in July 2017 to “deploy a suite of blockchain-enabled products to organize, systematize and bring verification and stability to the cannabis industry,” according to filings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
