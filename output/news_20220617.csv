The loan will be in two parts. The first is a cash/USDC-based credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The second revolving credit facility is for 15,000 BTC. Voyager will only use the credit facilities if needed to safeguard customer assets, the broker said in a statement on Friday.  The credit facilities will expire on Dec. 31, 2024, and will have an annual interest rate of 5% payable on maturity.  ""Today's actions give Voyager more flexibility to mitigate current market conditions and strengthen our relationship with one of the industry leaders,"" said Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich.  In addition to the funds available under the credit facilities, Voyager said it has more than $200 million on its balance sheet.  On May 17, shares of Voyager Digital were downgraded to neutral from buy by boutique investment firm Compass Point, which cited headwinds across the crypto industry and questioned how the trading platform's retail investors will fare during the market rout.  Previously, Voyager raised $60 million in a private placement offering at $2.34 a share led by Alameda Research.

42374599,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw0yDf,1655507035,Binance Suspends Withdrawals and Deposits in Brazil Following New Central Bank Policy,"This article is adapted from CoinDesk Brasil, a partnership between CoinDesk and InfoMoney, one of Brazil's leading financial news publications. Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Global crypto exchange Binance suspended deposits and withdrawals in Brazilian reals through the government's payment system Pix on Friday.  The company announced in a statement that it terminated a partnership with the local payment gateway Capitual, which operated Binance’s deposits and withdrawals via Pix for a year and eight months.  On its platform, Binance informed users that deposits via Pix are experiencing instability due to a policy change made by the Central Bank of Brazil (BC), without providing further details.  The service blockage coincides with the end of a deadline imposed by the BC for Pix providers to implement new KYC (know your customer) requirements.  “Binance will replace Capitual with a local payments provider with extensive experience, which will be announced soon,” the company stated, adding that it will take legal action against Capitual, without providing further details.  Binance is in the process of acquiring local brokerage Sim;paul, which has already been authorized by the Central Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company added.  Binance informed its users that withdrawals and deposits through Pix can take up to 72 hours to be cleared. The company added that users can still make peer-to-peer deposits and withdrawals.  This week, KuCoin, which also works with Capitual, announced a change in its know-your-customer (KYC) policies. The company started redirecting its users in the South American country to Capitual's website to complete their identity verification.

Amateurs and experts alike have been giving their predictions on what they believe will happen going forward. While most have been bearish, the forecast from Mike McGlone is a rather bullish one. The Bloomberg analyst has sparked hope in the hearts of some with his forecast that $20,000 is the new $5,000 for bitcoin. Good News For Bitcoin McGlone took to Twitter to share his forecast for the leading cryptocurrency in the market. Panic had washed through investors when the digital asset had declined to the $20,000 level, tethering just slightly above it.

This argument is by no means a new one. The limited supply of BTC has long been one of its pulls for investors who believe that in the end, the scarcity of the cryptocurrency will be what drives its price higher.

Trading in these assets without a proper understanding of the market dynamics can be very risky. Advertisements promoting specific crypto products can prompt people to trade impulsively. This leads to losses. Some governments across the globe are planning a crackdown on such misleading crypto advertisements. Virtual currencies are condemned because of their fluctuation, being used in shady transactions, and mass utilization of power generation in the mining period. They are however perceived as a thing of refuge throughout financial downpours. The cryptocurrency market is not regulated in many countries leaving investors vulnerable to fraud and scams. Countries where cryptocurrency is illegal include Bolivia, China, India, Iran and Egypt among others. Algeria has banned cryptocurrency recently following a financial law passed in 2018. Misleading advertisements are risky to investors and can lead to losses.

42374604,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw0yJx,1655504193,MakerDAO Cuts Off Its AAVE-DAI Direct Deposit Module,"MakerDAO, builder of decentralized, collateralized stablecoin DAI, has turned off the DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) as of June 17 21:04 UTC, following the passage of a governance vote on June 15.  D3M was created in cooperation with the Aave team and introduced in April 2021. According to Sam from the MakerDAO smart contracts team (@hexonaut), the module allows the Maker protocol “to enforce a maximum variable borrow rate for the DAI market on Aave.”  The Maker Protocol has now set its maximum borrow rate to 0 temporarily. With a borrow rate of 0, the Aave D3M module is turned off and will not mint fresh DAI into Aave’s lending market.  The two proposals  On June 14, DeFi platform Aave put forward a proposal intended to “mitigate risk to Aave [version 2] markets relating to the price deviation of stETH/ETH.” The proposal aimed to freeze the stETH market, increase the liquidation threshold for stETH to 90% and pause ETH borrowing.  Aave’s current liquidation threshold (LT) for stETH is 81%, which was recently increased on May 19. The change to increase the LT level of stETH was accompanied by Aave governance freezing UST on Aave v2 and decreasing loan-to-value (LTV) on stETH to 69%.  The team at financial modeling platform Gauntlet initiated the Aave proposal. In it, they said, “[Aave’s] current market liquidity is very likely sufficient to handle expected liquidations in the protocol and no immediate parameter changes or risk mitigations are necessary.” But in the midst of current crypto market conditions, the measure was meant to provide extra precaution for Aave’s decentralized finance (DeFi) platform in preventing a liquidation spiral.  In response to Aave’s proposal, however, Maker’s Risk Core Unit (RISK-001) initiated a proposal to temporarily disable the Aave DAI Direct Deposit Module, effective today, June 17. The Risk Core Unit described Aave’s governance proposal to increase the liquidation threshold for stETH to 90% as an “unacceptable risk to the Maker Protocol.”  The proposal states: “The AAVE-DAI pool currently has enough reserves right now for MakerDAO to withdraw. If the DAI reserves become empty, any periodic DAI repayments from other borrowers will be snatched quickly by bots and a protocol like MakerDAO will be locked-in for a long time.”  A ‘Lehman moment’ in crypto?  Primoz, a Maker Core Unit Facilitator and part of the Risk Core Unit Team, said that “the reason we believe this is risky is because out of 200 [million] DAI borrowed on Aave Ethereum v2, 100m DAI is being borrowed by Celsius and collateralized mostly by stETH.”  Celsius, the interest-earning yield platform that reported $11.8 billion in assets under management and $8.2 billion in loans as of May 17, 2022 has frozen withdrawals on June 12 and is facing proliferating rumors of insolvency.  “Contagion risks in DeFi are increasing,” Primoz said in an explanation posted to the Maker Forum. “You simply want to cut exposure in such times because there are so many unknown risks (Tether being a shareholder of Celsius comes next to mind). We could be dealing with Lehman’s moment in crypto. And everyone is probably overreacting but this makes risks even more severe.”  He went on to point out that “the beauty of D3M is that we can react in time unlike with other vaults so we can turn it off instantly.”  Even though Aave’s proposal was ultimately rejected earlier today, the D3M has still been disabled, at least temporarily. There will be a meeting convened in two weeks to discuss reactivating the module in the future.",NEUTRAL,ETH | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MKR | DAI,Sage D.

Key technical points: The OGN market price has increased 17.08% over the past 24 hours. The trendline breakout rally faces opposition from the 50-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Origin Protocol is $100 Million, indicating a hike of 67%. Past Performance of OGN OGN prices show a bullish attempt to break above the resistance trendline that has kept the bearish influence over the price trend for two months. The increase in buying pressure near the $0.18 support level resulted in a surge above 15% to surpass the resistance trendline. Source- Tradingview OGN Technical Analysis OGN prices showcase a boom in buying pressure as the trading volume jumps to support the price jump. Hence, the candle closing above the resistance trendline will likely result in a price jump to $0.30. The crucial SMAs - 50, 100, and 200-days maintain a bearish trend, with the 50-day SMA providing resistance to the breakout attempt. Hence, the breakout of the SMA will result in a high-momentum uptrend. The RSI slope shows an uptrend surpassing the 14-day SMA and preparing a jump above the halfway line.

The bad actors pose a ""significant threat"" to LinkedIn and its consumers, according to Sean Ragan, the FBI's special agent in charge of the San Francisco and Sacramento, Calif., field offices, according to the report. “This type of fraudulent activity is significant, and there are many potential victims, and there are many past and current victims,” Ragan said.  In a typical scenario, according to the report, a scammer will pose as a professional with a fake profile and reach out to a LinkedIn user, starting with small talk before elevating to an offer to make money through crypto investments. Eventually, the scammer leverages the trust earned over months to direct the user to invest money to a site controlled by the perpetrator, and then drains the account.  A group of victims told CNBC their losses ranged from $200,000 to $1.6 million.  The FBI has seen an increase in this particular investment fraud, said Ragan, confirming the agency has active investigations but could not comment because they are open cases.  LinkedIn acknowledged in a statement to CNBC that there has been a recent uptick of fraud on its platform. ""We work every day to keep our members safe, and this includes investing in automated and manual defenses to detect and address fake accounts, false information, and suspected fraud,” the company said.  While LinkedIn said it doesn’t provide estimates on how much money has been stolen from members through its platform, it did say it removed more than 32 million fake accounts from its platform in 2021, according to its semiannual report on fraud, the report added.  The report revealed that the majority of the perpetrators had been traced by the Global Anti-Scam Organization, a victim advocacy and support group, to Southeast Asia.

If bulls reject lower prices and recover above $1, BEL may expand to June 2022 highs. Past Performance of the Bella Protocol Bella Protocol token price performance has been exemplary in the few weeks. Even as the broader crypto markets posted lower lows from early May, BEL coin prices were firm. For perspective, BEL token prices added nearly 10X from mid-May to early June, peaking at $2.3. Currently, the coin is up six percent on the last trading day, trading below the middle BB. Bella Protocol Technical Analysis From the daily chart, buyers are in control. After a 10X surge, prices are cooling off, trading below the middle BB. However, the rejection of lower is a net positive. In the days ahead, how prices react at $0.80, or June 17 lows, and $1 will determine the medium-term trajectory. Ideally, risk-averse traders can wait for a break out in either direction. A high volume close above $1 and the middle BB may see BEL token prices surge to $2.3 and June 2022 highs in a buy trend continuation pattern. On the flip side, losses below $0.80 will confirm losses of June 16, fanning a sell-off towards $0.40. What to Expect from BEL? From the daily chart, buyers are in control.

A Suffolk County, N.Y., native, Bond is running for election in the Republican primary in New York’s 1st congressional district, which includes eastern Long Island. The district is currently represented by Republican Lee Zeldin, who leaft his seat to run for New York governor.  Though Bond has spent years in the crypto industry, she’s not running a crypto-centric campaign, unlike several other political candidates who have emerged from the industry, including longtime bitcoiner Bruce Fenton, who is running for the Republican nomination for New Hampshire’s seat in the U.S. Senate.  Instead, Bond – who describes herself as an “America First conservative” – says she’s more concerned about gas prices and the country’s economic growth. In a campaign announcement provided to CoinDesk, Bond describes herself as “pro-life, pro [former President Donald] Trump’s border wall … [and] she believes the police need to be defended, not defunded.”  Bond sees crypto as a part of the bigger picture of financial innovation.  “I’m obviously pro-innovation and I think [crypto’s] important for a lot of different reasons – for jobs, and opportunities and economic advancement,” Bond said. “My job in Congress will be to represent Suffolk County … I think the focus really needs to be on not just the broader topics but everything that’s affecting the day-in, day-out life of the residents of Suffolk County.”  “My experience from fintech and crypto and financial services and even my time on the Senate Banking Committee will inform my decisions but, really, my first and only loyalty is to representing my people at home,” Bond added.  If Bond wins the election, she will step down from her role as CEO at ADAM.  “I love ADAM, it’s been awesome building the association, growing it … I have every intention of staying [on as CEO] if I were not to win, but I’m going to win,” Bond said.

The report is a preview of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in Congress next week. Powell is expected to outline the Fed's plans to combat inflation. This week, Powell announced a 75-basis point rise in short-term interest rates, the largest increase in 28 years.  The report, which is submitted to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, elaborated on how ""generally, stablecoins that are not backed by safe and sufficiently liquid assets and are not subject to appropriate regulatory standards create risks to investors and potentially to the financial system, including susceptibility to potentially destabilizing runs.""  The terraUSD stablecoin collapsed in dramatic fashion last month, functionally losing all of its value. The report pointed to the ""concentrated nature"" of the stablecoin sector in which tether (USDT), USD coin (USDC) and Binance USD (BUSD) constituted more than 80% of the total market value, growing rapidly over the past year to more than $180 billion in March 2022.  According to the report, ""these vulnerabilities may be exacerbated by a lack of transparency regarding the riskiness and liquidity of assets backing stablecoins.""  The report added that the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have all made recommendations to address prudential risks posed by stablecoins.

42415236,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRe3T,1655485081,Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton Talks Rapidly Evolving Crypto Regulation Landscape,"Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton’s stance on the government’s efforts to regulate crypto technologies has seemingly softened since his time as SEC chair, according to comments from the former securities regulator during a discussion with Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm during the ""Grayscale Convenes"" livestream on LinkedIn Thursday.  The SEC can regulate many cryptocurrencies and classify them as securities because security laws regulate transactions in securities and not just the securities themselves, the ex-regulator said. He also noted that spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) face market manipulation concerns and detailed how cryptocurrencies’ global reach means that products regularly span the jurisdictions of various regulators, which renders it difficult for regulators to apply regulations to cryptocurrencies.  Grayscale is a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.  “If you look at different products or different aspects of what I would call the overall crypto ecosystem, [you] have products that span the jurisdiction of various domestic regulators, '' said Clayton. “So you had these global products and you’re trying to apply domestic regulation to them and then in applying domestic regulation to them you had products that had overlapping jurisdiction, and that made applying regulations challenging”  Clayton, who now serves as an adviser for Fireblocks, a $2 billion crypto custody firm, also shared that he now believes government agencies should not take a one-size-fits-all approach to crypto regulation.  “​​I believe that regulation, to the extent possible, should be technology agnostic,” said Clayton.  The ex-regulator, who helmed the most influential governmental regulatory body for the crypto industry from 2017 until his resignation in 2020, has been criticized for his shifting stance on crypto regulations before.  Last year, some members of the crypto community criticized Clayton for writing a pro-blockchain op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, calling out the ex-regulator’s role in spearheading the SEC’s pursuit of high-profile crypto projects that were alleged by the government agency to sell unregistered securities offerings.  During Clayton’s tenure, the SEC aggressively pursued crypto projects, including Block.One, which reached a settlement with the SEC over its $4 billion ICO for the EOS blockchain in late 2019. In addition, the ex-regulator’s time at the SEC paved the way for the agency’s suit against Ripple Labs, alleging it sold XRP as an unregistered security.

Alongside, the company entered a new $37 million equipment financing deal with NYDIG.  “In addition to lowering our interest expense, this $34 million reduction in borrowing gives us the ability to utilize more of our BTC holdings strategy as it frees up BTC that would otherwise be used to collateralize this credit facility,” said Bitfarms CFO Jeff Lucas in a press release.  The Galaxy facility was set to expire on June 30 and Bitfarms is now negotiating with Mike Novogratz’s crypto merchant bank to renew the line, according to the statement. The sale of 1,500 bitcoin to raise $34 million with which to partially pay down the loan implies an average price of about $22,000 per coin.  Bitfarms also agreed to an equipment financing deal with NYDIG for $37 million at a 12% interest rate. This loan is collateralized by the mining rigs at the company’s Leger and Bunker facilities.  Bitfarms’ moves come as crypto miners who levered up to fund speedy growth are feeling the squeeze of the crash in crypto markets.  The company is also in talks with NYDIG for additional funding which – if eventually agreed upon – might come in July and October as construction continues at the miner’s Bunker facility.  On February 25, Bitfarms closed a $32 million equipment financing loan with another lending firm, BlockFi, that carried a two-year term and interest rate of 14.5%.  The shares of the miner are up about 4% on Friday alongside a 1% gain in bitcoin. The stock’s lower by nearly 75% year to date.

42394201,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZh0H,1655482975,"FUD or Facts? Terra, Celsius Show Value of Asking Questions","Three weeks ago – before Consensus 2022, before the Federal Reserve put the fear of God into crypto traders, before the Celsius meltdown sent bitcoin on a downward spiral toward $20,000 – I wrote a column about the challenges quantum computing poses to blockchains.  Like clockwork came the cries of “FUD” from the Crypto Twitterati.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  FUD, for those who don’t know, stands for “fear, uncertainty and doubt.” The crypto community has long used the pejorative to describe what they see as falsehoods or exaggerations spread by opponents of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to scare off investors, regulators and the general public.  And that’s fine, I suppose, if you’re talking about deliberate attempts to spread ill will. But the knee-jerk way in which supporters of crypto resort to the “FUD” cry and other dismissive responses to any critique or expressions of concern about the space also reveal a worrisome immaturity in this space.  Too often, journalists, especially my team at CoinDesk, are targets of these responses when those reporters are simply asking the tough questions that any good media organization must ask to get to the facts.  Now, with the failings of two key systemically risky enterprises - Celsius and the Terra-Luna project – roiling the crypto markets, it’s my hope that people in this industry can finally appreciate the value of asking questions and finding failings. Kicking the tires on projects and holding people accountable for flaws within them is how the industry will improve and grow.  That’s true, whether it’s to explore what, if anything, must be done to upgrade blockchains to post-quantum proofs or whether it’s to expose the serious, vital questions that smart analysts are asking about the viability of Terraform Labs’ UST stablecoin or Celsius’ high-yield returns.  Attacking the messenger  Without wanting to pile on or indulge in “told you sos,” it’s worth pointing out how, over the past three years, CoinDesk reporters have covered Terraform Labs and Celsius and the responses they’ve received. The hard-hitting coverage has been relentless, as have the efforts to dismiss our line of questioning as FUD. Here are but a couple of examples:  In July 2020, former CoinDesk reporter Nate DiCamillo published a piece entitled “What Crypto Lender Celsius Isn’t Telling Its Depositors” about how the company may have been taking on “more risk than its depositors realize.” The reporter described the company’s operation in straightforward terms that made the risks clear: “Like a bank, Celsius Network borrows from one set of clients, lends to other customers and pockets the difference in interest. Unlike a bank, it only borrows and mainly lends cryptocurrency, and it does not have government deposit insurance.” Retweets of the story were met with cries of “fake news.” Celsius CEO and founder Alex Mashinsky was quoted in the piece telling a YouTube audience of “Celsians” - as the company’s users are known – “Don’t listen to the FUD-ers, look at the facts.” Mashinsky went to assure those same listeners “that the company is prudently deploying their crypto deposits,” DiCamillo wrote. FUD or prescient warning? You decide.  And then there’s Terraform Labs high-profile founder Do Kwon. In December, CoinDesk selected Kwon as one of its “Most Influential” for 2021. But acknowledging a person’s influence in an industry will never preclude our journalists from asking tough questions. At that time, with Terraform Labs under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the company having taken the dramatic step of filing a lawsuit against the SEC to challenge its subpoenas, our CoinDesk TV “First Mover” anchor Christine Lee asked Do Kwon for his thoughts on the U.S. regulatory situation. His response was surprising, given the situation: “In the U.S.? I have very little interest.” When Christine pressed him, Kwon claimed that because he was of Asian descent he had an interest in global affairs and wasn’t “obsessed with American policies and American regulations.” What ensued after that was a Twitter attack against Christine, in which Kwon stirred up a horde of “LUNAtics”against her. A few brave souls sprung to her defense, including one who pointed out that Kwon’s “I’m Asian” defense – as if he was indifferent to regulatory issues – was shallow, because he had not set up his company in his native South Korea but in the more lax regulatory jurisdiction of Singapore. But, of course, these defenders were immediately accused of FUD.  Lessons learned  The point here is that as journalists struggle to get to the truth, the people they are seeking answers from too often abuse the emotional connection their community of token holders have with their projects. They stir up the tribe to obfuscate and intimidate. It is ugly behavior and it looks bad for the industry.  More importantly, this lack of appreciation for fact-finding runs counter to the antifragile ethos of open-source systems. Crypto is supposed to be constantly improving and advancing, precisely because the bugs and flaws in its code and design are exposed and are subject to discussion and debate. Out of that process comes progress.

Among other remarks, Cortizo said it is “imperative to conform the new regulation with FATF [Financial Action Task Force] recommendations.”  Cortizo did not veto the entire bill, however, and the items to which he objected will now be debated by the Panamanian Congress.  Cortizo's partial veto comes in the context of Panama's presence on the “gray list” created by the FATF, which in March asked the Central American country to provide an ""action plan"" to address its concerns by June.  Gabriel Silva, the congressman who authored the bill, tweeted on Thursday that the veto “is a missed opportunity to generate jobs, attract investment and incorporate technology and innovation in the public sector.”  According to Silva’s tweets, the Government Committee of the Panamanian Congress will discuss the points considered unconstitutional by Cortizo, while the Commerce Committee will address the points Cortizo considers impractical. The bill then must go through a second and third debate, where only the vetoed points will be voted on.  “We are studying the veto to make corrections, but we must keep the law competitive,” added Silva.  In May, Cortizo said that he was likely to veto the bill, even though he described it as a good law at the time. “I have to be very careful if the law has clauses related to money laundering activities or anti-money laundering activities,” Cortizo said at that time.  The bill was initially approved by the Panamanian Congress on April 28 by 40 votes in favor and none against.  In addition to regulating the use of crypto for transactions, the original bill was crypto-friendly from a tax perspective, as it treated crypto assets as foreign-source income, meaning there were no taxes on capital gains, among other benefits.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/17/panamanian-president-partially-vetoes-crypto-regulation-legislation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f67cdb5835038705efce20a6bf4bc6ed8ab5b79-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415248,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPReAO,1655481950,Wallet That Helped Trigger UST Implosion Linked by Analysis Firm to Terra Developer,"UPDATE (June 30, 13:11 UTC): This story has been updated to reflect additional information received by CoinDesk indicating that the Uppsala report incorrectly identified the owner of the ""terra13s"" wallet. CoinDesk conducted an experiment to demonstrate that the ""terra13s"" wallet is a hot wallet of the OKX crypto exchange. A description of this experiment has been added to the story, along with a response from an Uppsala executive acknowledging that the results are clear.     A blockchain transaction that contributed to the collapse of Terra's UST stablecoin has been linked by a South Korean analysis firm to the ecosystem's chief developer, Terraform Labs.  CoinDesk Korea reported the findings by the blockchain analysis firm Uppsala Security earlier this week.  Uppsala, in its report, did not venture to provide a possible motive or rationale for the transaction, and officials with Terraform Labs did not reply to requests for comment.  But the findings have been shared with legal authorities in South Korea, where Terra enjoyed a huge following partly due to its Korean founder Do Kwon. The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office is “tracking the flow of problematic wallets and coins” and is aware of the wallets flagged in the report, according to CoinDesk Korea.  ""We compiled our report based on publicly available on-chain and online data, with the goal of providing evidence and leads to get closer to the truth that the impacted members of the community deserve to know,” Uppsala CEO Patrick Kim told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp message.  Who is behind 'Wallet A?'  Uppsala Security conducted an analysis of Terra wallets and flagged the Ethereum wallet “0x8d47f08ebc5554504742f547eb721a43d4947d0a” (referred to as ""Wallet A"") as one of the main addresses whose actions helped pushed prices of UST off of its intended $1 peg.  Blockchain data shows Wallet A swapped over 85 million UST for another dollar-linked stablecoin, USDC, on May 7 – just minutes after Terraform removed over 150 million UST from a liquidity pool on the lending platform Curve in a planned move.  Prices of UST fell under $1 almost immediately following these trades, which Uppsala said was a result of the lower liquidity on the Curve pool. Meanwhile, Wallet A’s newly acquired USDC was sent to Coinbase (COIN), one of the biggest crypto exchanges by trading volume.  ""There's no telling what happened to the funds transferred to these Binance and Coinbase wallets, whether they're still there or have since been transferred somewhere else,"" Uppsala wrote in the report.  On further investigation by Uppsala, Wallet A’s transaction history showed it had received the 85 million UST from “terra1yl8l5dzz4jhnzzh6jxq6pdezd2z4qgmgrdt82k,” a wallet address on the Terra blockchain. The UST on the Terra blockchain was converted into UST on the Ethereum blockchain via Wormhole, a swap service for exchanging tokens from one chain to another.  The transactional history of that wallet showed it regularly sent huge amounts of UST to crypto exchange Binance. Uppsala showed that the wallet transacted with several other Terra wallets such as “terra1gr0xesnseevzt3h4nxr64sh5gk4dwrwgszx3nw” (referred to as terra1gr). This aroused suspicions at Uppsala – since terra1gr was one of the official wallets of the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), which was set up by Kwon and other Terraform Labs officials to create a reserve for the ""algorithmic"" protocol behind UST.  According to Uppsala, apart from terra1gr, another Terra wallet ""terra13s4gwzxxx6dyjcf5m7"" (referred to as terra13s) exchanged funds recently with wallets on the Binance exchange that can be linked to Wallet A. Uppsala wrote that the terra13s wallet is now one of the official wallets of the LUNC DAO, a validator of Terra’s new Terra 2.0 blockchain.  However, a LUNC transaction made by CoinDesk was able to independently verify that the terra13s address is a hot wallet that belongs to the crypto exchange OKX. This was done by acquiring 25,000 LUNC on OKX and transferring the holdings out of OKX to another wallet address. The ""sender address"" was on a blockchain scanning tool Terra Finder revealed to be terra13s – proving the wallet is an OKX wallet.  CoinDesk pointed the finding out to Uppsala's Kim, who responded by stating, ""Yes it's clear.""  Investigation of all these wallets, their connections and their repeated transactions with each other led Uppsala to conclude that the wallets either had the same owner or were managed by a single entity.  Uppsala says the findings mean the actions of Terraform Labs may have ultimately resulted in UST’s implosion. “It means that Terraform Labs or LFG made a financial transaction that caused Terra to collapse on its own,” the team said in its report.  ""Not only Wallet A but also the wallet connected to it were managed by Terraform Labs and related companies,” Uppsala’s Kim told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp message.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ZRX | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/17/wallet-that-helped-trigger-ust-implosion-linked-by-analysis-firm-to-terra-developer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d13f04b58a159685c26a36b7ef488cbd0c1a2280-1872x1220.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415235,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRe2q,1655476680,Lido Finance Warns Leverage Is a ‘Hell of a Drug’,"Ethereum staking firm Lido Finance, whose derivative products are a component in the crisis currently engulfing firms like Celsius and Three Arrows Capital, saw the writing on the wall and tried to “nudge” some big players to unwind their leveraged positions. But many didn’t.  The leverage concerns became most apparent after Lido became integrated with decentralized finance (DeFi) giant Aave in March of this year, explained Jacob Blish, head of business development and partnerships at Lido Finance. The situation raised fundamental questions about the extent to which a decentralized platform like Lido should intervene in its users’ appetite for risk, he said.  “When we saw the leverage issue was starting to really come to a head, we tried to take a few initiatives and ended up spending a few million dollars to allow some larger players to unwind,” said Blish. “But a lot of people still didn’t unwind.”  Blish pointed out it’s not Lido’s job to police how much return users can have. “We’re not your parents,” he said. “I guess we didn’t think how much leverage would be taken out. We wanted Aave, and as soon as we got Aave leverage just kind of kicked off. And leverage is a hell of a drug, as they say.”  After the LUNA collapse, Celsius froze all withdrawals, causing a domino effect in the market that saw a broad crypto selloff and numerous job cuts by some larger companies, including Coinbase (COIN). Meanwhile, insolvency rumors are also beginning to emerge around crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  Read more: How Crypto Lender Celsius Overheated  Lido Finance, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), allows supporters of Ethereum who pledged ether (ETH) ahead of the blockchain’s merge to proof-of-stake (PoS) to use the assets they locked up. It is the largest of the Ethereum staking services.  Lido provides those users with a derivative token called stETH which can be swapped back for ETH on a 1:1 basis, but only once the transition to PoS is complete. In the meantime, stETH combines the value of the initial staking deposit with staking rewards which accrue daily in a token that can earn further yield on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like Aave, Curve and SushiSwap.  ‘Folded leverage’  Unfortunately, stETH has become a focus of heavy leverage, and as crypto markets have quickly flipped from a risk-on to risk-off, firms chasing returns without having properly hedged – as is the case with Celsius – have ended up in a bind.  Adding layers of complexity and risk, users of Lido’s liquid staking products started creating so-called “revolving loans,” where stETH attained by staking ETH at Lido would be deposited in Aave and used as collateral to borrow additional ETH. This process was then continually repeated.  “Once we were listed on Aave, that really opened up the opportunity for what we call folded leverage or cycle leverage where you do that a few times to really ramp up your risk and reward,” Blish said.  Despite the obvious risk attached to something like this, it becomes a complex issue that can’t be simply resolved.  “If we impose limits, what if Aave doesn’t,” asked Blish. “Or if we and Aave do, but some third party doesn’t, what happens then … And all we can do is help nudge to provide some space, and as much education on the risks that come with these strategies as we can. But at the end of the day, DeFi is about choosing your own adventure,” he added.  A worry for many crypto natives is that Celsius and the situation with Lido’s liquid staking product will be viewed by the outside world, and particularly by regulators, as somehow analogous to the recent blowup of the Terra Luna stablecoin and DeFi platform.  PTSD from Terra  Blish pointed out the obvious differentiator here is that UST and LUNA was not collateralized, whereas every stETH token in existence is backed fully by 1 ETH. Indeed, the whole idea of stETH “depegging” is a common misnomer, he added.  “People have been stuck on the idea of a peg,” Blish said. “That’s probably PTSD from what happened with terra- luna, where it was supposed to be pegged under all circumstances,” he noted. “For us, we call it an exchange rate. Really what it comes down to is you’re discounting future cash flows compared to your need for liquidity today.”  Since true unbonding is not available until the Ethereum merge has happened – thus allowing withdrawals from the Beacon Chain – this has created a liquidity squeeze on the popular DeFi platform Curve.  Read more: Crypto Market Chaos: No, Lido Is Not ‘the Next Terra’  “Players such as Celsius or Three Arrows Capital that were basically over leveraged or over exposed have seen their clients want to withdraw their money, and there’s an obligation to provide that liquidity,” he said. “When that happens in mass across the entire market, and you’re adding retail and other players in the space – all trying to go against this one-way exit – that’s where this exchange rate conversation really started becoming a problem.”  ‘Nothing’s pegging’  Others in the staking space are taking stock of the unraveling situation at Celsius. For instance, Konstantin Richter, CEO of rival staking services firm Blockdaemon, has concluded that institutional-grade liquid staking should only be done in a tightly controlled environment, with full know-your-customer (KYC) and limits on the amount firms can borrow against the pool.  “We believe that you need pools that are fully insured and guaranteed,” Richter said in an interview. “Lido is a much larger player and really a consumer product and has a lot of different complexity to adhere to. And I think they're doing a good job. People talk about de-pegging, but that’s really the wrong word. Nothing’s pegging; everything’s backed one to one.”  On the subject of Celsius’s woes, Richter said the firm has been a cornerstone of the crypto landscape for a long time and that people should resist from assuming malicious intent.  “It’s very hard to prepare any business for a market environment like the one we’re currently experiencing. You can’t expect firms to have a crystal ball,” he said. “What I would say is it’s actually remarkable that the DeFi platforms are all holding up and resolving themselves without having to get bailed out,” he added.",NEGATIVE,ETH | LUNA,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/17/lido-finance-warns-leverage-is-a-hell-of-a-drug,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b121ddacabf591dc7957aef2906a220b4d2e2d7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fund had over $3 billion worth of cryptocurrencies under management as of April.  3AC is exploring options including asset sales and a rescue by another firm and hopes to reach a settlement with creditors, Davies said. 3AC owes at least $6 million to crypto exchange BitMEX, as per a separate report by The Block Friday.  Davies said 3AC invested over $200 million in LUNA tokens as part of a $1 billion raise by the Luna Foundation Guard in February, an amount that is now essentially worthless since the Terra ecosystem imploded in mid-May. “The Terra-Luna situation caught us very much off guard,” Davies told the WSJ.  LUNA lost nearly all of its value over the course of a week, while ecosystem algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) fell to a few pennies after losing its intended peg with the U.S. dollar.  3AC was additionally known as one of the largest holders of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), an institutional bitcoin product, as well as staked ether (stETH) tokens, both of which have seen steep declines recently. (Grayscale and CoinDesk are independent subsidiaries of the Digital Currency Group.)

The recovery followed a record nine-day slide that caused the bitcoin price to fall from $31,000 in early June to just over $20,000. Bitcoin has slumped almost 70% from a November's lifetime high of over $69,000.  Among equity markets, Hong Kong’s Hang Sang rose 1.1%, the Shanghai Composite added nearly 1%, Germany’s DAX gained 1.41% and the Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 1.22%. U.S. index futures also gained.  The recovery in markets came as traders assessed the long-term impact made by Wednesday's U.S. Federal Reserve decision to raise interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the agency remained committed to bringing down inflation and increased interest rates by 75 basis points, causing a brief relief rally in global and crypto markets.  “Although a 50 basis point hike was anticipated for many weeks, last Friday’s inflation data forced the market to price in a more aggressive hike with huge sell pressure,” Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at crypto broker GlobalBlock, said in an email. “Therefore, a 75 bp hike was priced in for the short-term leading to a rally.”  Sotiriou, however, added that there could be more downside in the next few months after this week’s rally cools.  “This is due to concerns around an earnings recession on the horizon, as a result of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policy. According to Bank of America, stagflation fears are the highest since 2008, and profit outlooks are the worst since the GFC (Global Financial Crisis) too,” Sotiriou said. The negative environment could cause an “uptick in foreclosures and bankruptcies.”  Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, seconded the sentiment.  ''There is unlikely to be sustained relief from the sinking feeling that has hit financial markets this week,” Streeter told CoinDesk in an email. “After the initial boost of optimism that the Federal Reserve was going to get a handle on inflation with the 0.75% rate rise, the mood soured on Wall Street as concerns mounted that the price spiral was going to be an even harder nut to crack, without fresh aggressive hikes.”  Some, like Alex Kuptsikevich, an FxPro senior market analyst, maintained a bearish outlook for bitcoin in the short term.  “The bearish focus remains on the $20,000 level, the former peak of 2017. At no time in past cycles has BTC fallen below the high of the previous bull cycle,” Kuptsikevich explained in an email.  The analyst added uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency fund Three Arrows Capital could result in contagion risks amid growing speculation about “its possible bankruptcy.” The fund is said to have faced at least $400 million in liquidations after failing to meet collateral requirements on its levered positions, as previously reported.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/17/bitcoin-recovers-over-21k-as-fed-commits-to-slow-inflation-traders-remain-cautious,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b74c2a42589e9056ac78f5bb9ac25329c31947a-4001x3001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Applications for up to $50,000 in funds open Monday, and funds will be issued in mid-July.  With the recent collapse in crypto prices causing many companies to lay off workers and scale back projects, Alchemy sees the slump as a time for Web3 projects to flourish.  “We believe as ecosystem builders, it's our responsibility to help everyone get excited about the new technology, but also to bring new developers within the ecosystem even during the market downturn,” Paul Almasi, Alchemy’s head of ecosystem development, told CoinDesk.  Alchemy plans to fund the grants initiative out of pocket in order to control the allocation of funds. Alchemy, raised $200 million in a funding round in February that valued the company at $10.2 billion.  Almasi said Alchemy hopes to fund projects dedicated to increasing the utility of non-fungible tokens (NFT) and making decentralized finance (DeFi) accessible to institutions and at-home traders alike. He said he’s looking to fill the first cohort with a “diverse representation of builders,” chosen internally by the Alchemy team.  Beyond providing capital to developers building Web3 projects, Alchemy has additionally invested in educational platforms Web3 U and The Road to Web3.  “Building Web3 is really painful … we want to have a centralized place where people can go and learn about these things in a structured way,” said Almasi.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/17/alchemy-launches-25m-developer-grant-program-to-fund-web3-projects,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b17864a3af7b91caf0920ad4f893c777b7e512ab-4724x3543.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The three moved to distance themselves from 3AC, which may be facing possible insolvency after incurring at least $400 million in liquidations earlier this week amid a tumbling market and troubles at crypto lender Celsius.  “[D]YdX is not exposed to 3AC contagion in any way,” developers said in a tweet in early Asian hours.  DeFiance Capital founder Arthur Cheong said in a tweet the firm was “not done” and was “actively working to resolve the situation.” Cheong’s tweet came hours after Messari founder Ryan Selkis said 3AC faced liabilities of over $1 billion and that funds like DeFiance “may be done.”  “DeFiance always operates independently,” Cheong wrote in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.  Avalanche, a 3AC portfolio project, said its treasury funds were not custodied or managed by 3AC. “Due to recent speculation, we’d like to clarify that 3AC has never in any way managed, used, or custodied any Avalanche Foundation treasury funds,” the project tweeted.  At its peak, Dubai-based 3AC managed billions of dollars and its founders, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, were two of the most vocal crypto market participants in the past few years.  While 3AC hasn’t commented on the speculation, Zhu said the team is in contact with relevant parties. “We are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out,” Zhu tweeted.

""Babel Finance is facing unusual liquidity pressures,"" the statement reads, before alluding to major fluctuations in the market and ""conductive risk events"" among institutional market participants.  Last month, Babel raised $80 million in a Series B round with a valuation of $2 billion.  At the end of 2021, Babel Finance had an outstanding loan balance of over $3 billion, up from $2 billion the previous February. It averaged $800 million in monthly derivatives trading volume and had structured and traded over $20 billion in options products.  On Thursday, rival staking platform Finblox made a similar decision, restricting withdrawals to $1,500 per month due to its connection with Three Arrows Capital.  Three Arrows Capital has found itself at the center of insolvency speculation, with several leading exchanges liquidating the fund's positions, according to a report by The Block.  The cryptocurrency market is at its lowest point since December 2020, with bitcoin (BTC) trading narrowly above $20,000 while ether (ETH) holds onto the psychological level of support at $1,000. The market has been hit by negative sentiment exacerbated by crypto lender Celsius halting withdrawals earlier this month.  “Babel Finance is taking action to best protect the interests of our clients,"" a company spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""We are in close communication with all related parties and will share updates in a timely manner.""  UPDATE (June 17, 11:51 UTC): Added Babel's outstanding loan balance at end of 2021.

42415251,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPReBe,1655432831,"Biggest ‘stETH’ Pool Almost Empty, Complicating Exit for Would-Be Sellers","As cryptocurrency markets swooned in recent weeks, large institutional crypto investors including Alameda and Three Arrows Capital have used the blockchain protocol Curve to dump their holdings of a token known as staked ether (stETH). The urgency came because the price of the stETH tokens unexpectedly deviated from a supposed peg to the price of ether (ETH) – the bigger, better-known native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, which is the second-biggest overall by market capitalization after bitcoin.  Now, however, the so-called liquidity pool in Curve that the investors used to get rid of their stETH is quickly drying up, a dynamic that might force future sellers into less-transparent over-the-counter markets where discounts might be even steeper.  The pool in question on Curve lets investors exchange stETH to ETH. Since early May, its total value locked (TVL) – a common way of measuring the size of these protocols in decentralized finance – dropped to $621 million from $4.6 billion, data shows. It is also heavily imbalanced, holding almost five times as many stETH as ether, making it expensive or impossible to swap large amounts of tokens.  “I feel badly for retail holders, because the Curve pool has been their only way out,” Vance Spencer, co-founder of venture capital investment firm Frameworks, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Institutions still can get their way out of this with over-the-counter (OTC) deals, although at a significant discount, much higher than in the Curve pool.”  'stETH discount'  The discount on stETH has been in analysts’ spotlight as a telling sign of the recent liquidity crisis in crypto markets. One stETH represents an ETH token locked up on Ethereum’s new blockchain, called the Beacon Chain.  During times of high inflation and aggressive rate hikes, investors prefer holding ""liquid"" assets that can be easily sold. The problem is that the tokens locked up on the Beacon Chain cannot be redeemed in the foreseeable future, until six to 12 months after Ethereum successfully completes a much-anticipated upgrade to a ""proof-of-stake"" network, often referred to as the Merge. And based on the latest estimate from top Ethereum officials, the Merge isn't expected until August at the earliest.  Read more: What Is 'the Merge' and Why Has It Taken So Long?  Chase Devens, analyst at blockchain data platform Messari, wrote in a note earlier this week that “stETH is in the early stages of its natural price discovery,” and the discount “will likely close when staked ETH is unlocked on Ethereum’s Beacon Chain.""  Large holders flee  Until last month's implosion of the Terra blockchain, stETH traded at a one-to-one ratio with ether. But then, a 2-3% gap between prices opened up. The gap further widened to 5-6% by early June in the wake of the financial troubles of crypto lender Celsius and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital – both major holders of stETH.  “The transparency of the positions of Celsius and Three Arrows Capital had put those firms at a disadvantage in the sense that short sellers knew how much to attack certain assets to try and cause liquidations,” Lex Sokolin, head economist and global fintech co-head at Ethereum developer ConsenSys, told CoinDesk in an email.  Consequently, some large holders dumped their stETH to get ETH, mostly using the Curve pool. Data by Kaiko showed that the stETH-ETH Curve pool was responsible for 98.5% of all decentralized exchange trading volumes in stETH in the last few months, while trading on centralized exchanges was negligible.  Amber, a crypto investment platform, pulled out $160 million within days in early June, according to the Kaiko report. Alameda Research, a digital asset trading firm, sold $88 million in stETH. Three Arrows Capital, the hedge fund that faces a potential insolvency, redeemed about 400,000 ETH and stETH tokens from the protocol in May.  ""The reason liquidity providers left is that once the peg broke, they got a terrible deal in that they were selling ETH too cheap,” said Bob Baxley, chief technology officer of automated market maker Maverick Protocol. “As the pool became imbalanced, they did not want to get trapped only holding illiquid stETH.”  As a result, the Curve pool has lost 85% of its value, and holds roughly 111,000 ETH and 492,000 stETH, an indication that many more investors want to sell stETH for ETH than the other way around.  Investors are trapped  Celsius, a big crypto lender now under keen scrutiny since it halted withdrawals citing ""extreme market conditions,"" might be trapped with its stETH holdings.  Celsius still holds at least about 409,000 stETH, worth about $413 million at current prices, according to data provided by Ape Board, a portfolio tracker from the blockchain analysis firm Nansen.  The stETH-ETH Curve pool only has about 110,000 ether, meaning there’s simply not enough tokens to swap stETH into.  “Celsius couldn’t have sold all of their stETH on centralized or decentralized exchanges, and as a result likely had or will have to resort to an OTC-type transaction in an effort to remain solvent,” Kaiko’s Ryder wrote in the note.  Average investors who want to get rid of stETH may have even fewer options, since they typically cannot access over-the-counter markets to strike a deal.  Centralized exchanges don't have enough market depth for the stETH-ETH trading pair for those who want to sell, the Kaiko report showed.  The only way out left for retail investors is the Curve pool, which has been rapidly shrinking by 10,000-15,000 ETH a day this week.  Assuming that rate continues, the pool would be fully drained within two weeks.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/17/biggest-steth-pool-almost-empty-complicating-exit-for-would-be-sellers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd5b142ed07d7049da90dd6de93e650b41502020-2047x1343.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cryptos, which had risen Wednesday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a determined inflationary tone, returned their gains Thursday amid fresh investor worries about rising prices, global tumult and a looming recession.  Bitcoin was recently trading just above $20,300, down more than 10% over the previous 24 hours and again raising questions about whether it might soon break support at $20,000 and spur a fresh round of liquidations. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap after bitcoin, was testing the $1,050 waters where it last waded over a year ago, and was off over 15%. Other altcoins assumed various shades of red, with DOT and UNI recently down over 16% and 13%, respectively.  ""Investors and traders should be prepared that [Wednesday’s] rebound could choke out rather quickly,"" FxPro senior analyst Alex Kuptsikevich wrote early Thursday. He said investors need to be ready because ""cryptocurrencies and risky assets in financial markets are unlikely to reliably bounce back before there are signals the economy has stopped slowing.""  Cryptocurrency prices, which have correlated with stocks in recent months, once again tracked major equity indexes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, despite its bevy of blue chip stocks, plummeted below 30,000 for the first time in 18 months after closing down 2.4% for the day. The S&P 500, which entered bear market territory earlier in the week (meaning it has fallen at least 20% from its previous high), was off 3.3% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged a whopping 4.1%.  Gold, a traditional risk-off asset, rose 1.2%.  For the cryptocurrency industry, the day was another forgettable one. Celsius watchers continued monitoring the latest fallout from the lending platform's decision to halt withdrawals and other news. CoinDesk reported that Texas, Alabama and other states are investigating Celsius' decision in light of investor needs. “I am very concerned that clients – including many retail investors – may need to immediately access their assets yet are unable to withdraw from their accounts,” Rotunda told Reuters. “The inability to access their investment may result in significant financial consequences.”  Meanwhile, Crypto lender BlockFi confirmed Thursday it recently liquidated a “large client” amid reports that troubled crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital failed to meet margin calls. The crypto hedge fund (see Insights below) has historically been among the industry’s most prolific investors in new protocols and is also a large borrower. And exchange giant Coinbase's (COIN) stock tumbled more than 7% to a new closing low just two days after announcing the layoff of about 1,100 employees. Other crypto exchanges, including the Winklevoss twins-led Gemini and Latin America-based Bitso and Buenbit, have also recently cut jobs.  Entrepreneur and ""Shark Tank"" host Kevin O'Leary told CoinDesk TV that Celsius' strategy was proving wrong. ""It looks like when it came time for a liquidity event, they weren't able to provide liquidity,"" he said. ""The concept of gating, shutting down is completely against the concept of decentralized finance. If I had an account there, I'd be a pretty pissed off cowboy.""  O'Leary sees bitcoin continuing to drop, perhaps 20%, yet he struck an optimistic note about crypto's future, noting among other developments WonderFi Technologies becoming the first crypto exchange to list on a major institutional stock exchange in Canada, the Toronto Stock Exchange, and similar initiatives in other countries. He was also encouraged by the introduction of three, bi-partisan, crypto bills in recent months in the U.S. and called crypto's recent problems and price drop ""the beginning of a bottoming out process.""  ""It's a birthing thing,"" he said. ""It's the beginning of a nascent industry. The bad ideas need to be weeded out. You need to strip the Band-Aid off the wound. This is all good.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,666 -3.3%  DJIA: 29,992 -2.4%  Nasdaq: 10,646 -4.4%  Gold: $1,857 +1.2%  Insights  After the Crypto Thaw, Firms Like Three Arrows Capital Will Struggle to Find a Place  In market downturns, cash will always be king. That was true for firms battling liquidations at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, and firms caught in the crossfire of this summer’s crypto meltdown.  Singapore-based Three Arrows Capital is now at the center of everyone’s attention. The crypto hedge fund has historically been one of the industry’s most prolific investors in new protocols and is also a large borrower. But now it’s in trouble: Facing $400 million in liquidations on its positions, it’s now ghosting its counterparties and liquidity providers. Messari’s fund profiler says the firm is down approximately 58% on the year, which has no doubt compounded its problems. On-chain data suggests the fund is trying to pay down debt by liquidating staked ether.  The question is, how much cash does Three Arrows Capital have? What’s the value of its assets under management?  Both those questions are hard to answer. The best clue to Three Arrows’ cash position comes from its registration with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. There, MAS says that it’s registered to manage assets under S$250 million (US$179.9 million). A December 2020 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that Three Arrows’ position in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust – worth $1.2 billion at the time – was split between its Singapore and British Virgin Islands entity.  (New York-based Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)  But again, this doesn’t demonstrate how much cash Three Arrows has. Using leveraged bitcoin has always been an option to buy-in to GBTC and for the longest time it was possible to premium harvest GBTC and churn it into a source of yield.  The fund has always been coy with its assets under management (AUM), never disclosing it in public and never denying estimated numbers published by research houses.  On-chain analytics house Nansen at one time put that number at $10 billion, but it would be difficult to get an exact number without being able to identify all of Three Arrows’ wallets. Nansen has identified many, but not all, making it impossible to determine this number precisely – or figure out how much leverage is being used.  What we do know about the black box of Three Arrows is that virtually every lending platform from Celsius to Aave has exposure. After all, that’s how they were able to generate the double-digit yield on their deposits. An eventual haircut from Three Arrows will be tough, especially as it comes during a general market drawdown.  Of course, if Three Arrows had a cash position that was more reflective of its crypto AUM, there would be less of an issue overall (let’s not count stablecoins in this as many are fighting hard to maintain their peg).  When crypto rebuilds after this deep correction there will certainly be less tolerance for these black boxes. The entire industry is based on transparency; it’s the defining attribute of the blockchain. Future hedge funds will have no problem putting everything on-chain for the world to see, making surprise liquidations a thing of the past – in theory.  Technician's Take  (Editor's Note: In place of Technician's Take, First Mover Asia is republishing a column by Tusk Venture Partners co-founder Bradley Tusk and head of legal at Dibbs, Thomas Mack)  The cliche is that the only things unavoidable in life are death and taxes. We can probably add new technology to the list, too. Artificial intelligence (AI), the metaverse, autonomous vehicles, flying cars – they’re all coming.  Lawmakers, if they want to be on top of a paradigm shift, should approach tech regulation in a way that is thoughtful, perceptive and comprehensive. But reaching consensus in our statehouses is challenging and finding any sort of common ground in Washington, D.C., is virtually impossible.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Making matters worse, a comprehensive approach to tech policy typically occurs only after some crisis forces legislators’ hands and the media is all over them, only increasing the risk that the law is hasty or ill-conceived.  While new regulatory frameworks will be needed in some areas of Web3 – the version of the internet driven by blockchain – there are other areas where innovators and investors can move the ball forward on the basis of existing laws and regulations, all the while simplifying the task for policymakers.  So let’s talk about technological neutrality.  By “technological neutrality” in the context of Web3 and tech innovation, we mean this: If new technology enables activities that are mostly the same as existing activities, let’s start with an assumption that the law treats the two activities similarly.  Said differently, wherever possible, the law should be neutral to the tech and any variations in legal treatment should come from (and be tailored to) material variations in the business or risks associated with the technology.  U.S. President Joseph Biden’s recent executive order on crypto, while leaving a whole lot unsettled, gives an implicit nod to this approach when declaring, “same business, same risks, same rules.” The crypto community will likely hate the approach the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) takes, but at least it’s now in a context we can all understand.

For instance, in the midst of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom; an SEC chair once said every ICO token he had seen was a security. That suggested, although digital tokens on distributed ledgers are infinitely variable and could represent anything from book club points to stock in a corporation, legal risks in Web3 stem from the technology rather than what lawyers call a substantive activity.  Under this paradigm, tokens on distributed ledgers were/are “high risk.” However, that hardly makes sense. This type of thinking is no doubt part of the U.S.’s inability to effectively regulate crypto currently and – if we don’t learn from it – Web3 in the future.  Seeking a unified regulatory scheme to oversee “distributed ledgers” – a general purpose technology with highly variable uses – is like seeking a unified regulatory scheme for uses for spreadsheets.  Appropriate oversight  Rather than starting with the technology as the bucketing function, let’s start with how people actually use the technology (their substantive activities), and the presumption that blockchain tech is irrelevant.  What is the business? What rights are being created between parties? How are those rights communicated from seller to buyer? What risks are associated with the business?  If we start with these questions, we usually find that there is relevant precedent in the existing laws, regulations or case law. And more importantly, if innovators, investors and regulators can use this as a shared starting point, we could take a couple of significant steps.  First, tech innovators and investors should have a common framework to assess risk associated with leading edge businesses. A vague sense that Web3 businesses are “risky” can be replaced by targeted questions and answers. What existing businesses does this most resemble? How are those businesses regulated? How is this business different from those businesses? Which of those differences are legally significant, and what are you doing to address risks stemming from that? What here actually impacts regular people and how?  Second, the task for policymakers can be simplified. With a technology as broad as Web3 and crypto, asking a regulator for clarity on Web3 and crypto is understandably daunting. The internet is a broad technology, and regulation would, of course, change depending on whether you’re discussing ecommerce or social networking, consumer protection or data privacy, etc.  If our starting point of technological neutrality can get us good answers on most issues associated with a particular Web3 activity, we can then rely on policymakers for a smaller subset of truly novel issues.

But there will also be vast swaths of Web3 and crypto that are simply new ways to do the same old things. Not everything is revolutionary. And where that’s the case, let’s lean in on what clarity does exist under the law.  In other words if the government’s failure to properly understand and regulate Web2 has taught us anything, it’s that we need to make this a lot easier for them. Even if we do, they still may drop the ball. Or their politics may cause them to favor entrenched interests regardless of the impact of any particular Web3 business.  Protecting consumers, protecting businesses from fraud is what matters. Not passing value judgements on the merits of one technology over another.
