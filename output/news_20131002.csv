42376604,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bP25,1380730587,Silk Road shut down and 'owner' Ross William Ulbricht arrested,"Silk Road's alleged owner Ross William Ulbricht, aka 'Dread Pirate Roberts', has been arrested with reports also claiming the online black market has been shut down by the FBI.  Currently, the site, which is operated as a Tor hidden service and is famously used by some bitcoin users to buy drugs, displays a notice stating that the site has been seized.  According to court documents published on journalist Brian Krebs' website Krebs on Security, Ulbricht was arrested as he ""intentionally and knowingly did combine, conspire, confederate and agree … to violate the narcotics laws of the United States"".  Ulbricht is also being charged with possessing and distributing controlled substances and committing or conspiring to commit computer hacking offences and money laundering offences.  The court document states that, on or around 29th March, Ulbricht also ""solicited a Silk Road user to execute a murder-for-hire of another Silk Road user, who was threatening to release the identities of thousands of users of the site"".  There have been reports that, in the arrest of Ulbricht, 26,000 bitcoins were seized, which equated to around $3.26m at the close of yesterday, but $2.47m at the time of writing.  The price of bitcoin has dropped significantly since news broke of Ulbricht's arrest and the closure of Silk Road as people 'panic sell' their digital currency stashes.    In arrest of Silk Road website owner Ross William Ulbricht FBI seized 26,000 #bitcoins worth $3.6 million. Largest seizure ever of Bitcoins.      — Shimon Prokupecz (@shimon4ny) October 2, 2013    Ulbricht has protected his identity through encryption and anonymity tools, but an FBI spokesperson, who asked not to be named, told Forbes they were able to catch the website owner after he made a ""simple mistake"".  “This is supposed to be some invisible black market bazaar. We made it visible. When you interviewed [Ulbricht], he said he would never be arrested. But you can't resist the FBI. We will find you,"" they said.

42376609,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bP8N,1380722400,Beefing up profits: farmer achieves 20% bitcoin sales,"When it comes to businesses accepting bitcoin, there is nothing hi-tech about a farmer and his wife selling beef in rural Australia. However, David and Peta Moloney are doing for the beef industry what bitcoin is doing to the financial one: disrupting it.  High-profile companies such as Wordpress and Foodler already take bitcoin, but the percentage of income generated in bitcoin is still very low. OKCupid, another big name to take bitcoin told us less than 5% of their revenue comes from the currency.  So how has a beef-seller in northern New South Wales achieved up to 20% of his business in bitcoin?  There is no denying that Honestbeef has found its niche in the market, providing ethical, additive-free beef to primarily metropolitan consumers.  David believes Australians are much more conscious these days of what they are eating and where it is coming from and says a large portion of his client-base are allergy sufferers.  Honest beginnings  The business started after the Australian drought of 2003 when the couple were living in Canberra, fed up with paying sky-high prices for poor-quality beef.  “Trying to get a nice piece of steak was terribly expensive,” David says. “We just thought 'this isn’t right, there’s got to be a better way'. We knew farmers who were selling it for AU$3 a kilo and thought 'why shouldn’t they get more money and people get better beef?'”  By joining these dots, Honestbeef began operating the following year, priding itself on the quality of its animal welfare as well as the actual beef.  The company only offers beef products because the abattoir closest to the business in Hogarth Range deals solely with cows.  “All our farms are around the abattoir so the animals don’t have to suffer a long journey,” explains David. “The trips are no longer than twenty minutes so that keeps them calm and there’s less stress.”  This ethos extends to the way the farmers manage the cattle as well. None of the cows are grain-fed. David said:  “It’s nice, relaxed farming, nothing intense, no hormones or anything like that. [The farmers] look after the land and look after the animals.”  Likewise, David ensures his customers know exactly what they are getting, explaining that it takes just nine days for the cow to get from the farmer to the consumer.  “It’s off the farm, into the abattoir, it hangs for six days and then it’s straight to the butcher. Two days later, they’re eating it, so they know exactly how old it is. It’s fresh beef, we don’t add anything to it.”  In fact, the animals are still alive in the fields when a customer places an order. About six to seven customer orders make up a whole animal and when these are in, David will liaise with his farmers to find a cow of a suitable weight and size to fit the orders.  This sustainable order-animal matching model means minimal waste.  It also sees David offering the farmers 10-20% above market price for a cow and then selling the meat packs directly to the consumer. Over 70% of the $10.75 a kilo that the customer pays goes to the farmer and butcher.  Honest pricing  Honestbeef make an effort to keep their pricing transparent.  “We show everything about our pricing structure, what we’re doing, how much money we make, how much money the farmer is getting and how much the butcher is getting,” David says, adding that in terms of getting the cow from field to fork, it is “as peer-to-peer beef as you can get"".  The similarities with bitcoin as an open-source, peer-to-peer currency are not lost on David and it seems starting to accept bitcoin was a natural progression.  “It fitted in with our business because we don’t accept credit cards or PayPal or anything like that,” he says.  He admits this was due to “the hassle and cost of setting up a payment gateway”.  Despite having had no issues with people wanting refunds, “if someone did decide they wanted their money back, we wouldn’t really get a say in it, we’d have to take them to small claims court, which for a small company like us, it’s just not on,” David says.  Before introducing bitcoin, Honestbeef dealt only with direct bank deposits, but the company soon saw that bitcoin offers the same advantages.  “It’s great to know that [charge backs] can’t happen without us trying to come to a resolution first. It just gives us more control,” David adds.  A self-confessed nerd, David discovered bitcoin when he was trawling the Internet one day in late 2010. He said:  “I thought about it for three to six months and looked at the forecasts and thought this seems like the real McCoy. I wasn’t investing in it at the time, I was just watching it and I thought this is going to bloody work!”  The company’s first bitcoin transaction was in 2011.  “Our first order was when bitcoin was at AU$5,” says David. “We were given 45 of them for a box of beef. More than half of those have gone now but the rest are still sitting there.”  Since that first transaction, around 10% of Honestbeef’s customers have been paying in bitcoin and in the last three months alone, that figure has doubled.  He acknowledges that it is quite rare to take such a relatively high volume of bitcoin transactions. He says he listed the company on the bitcoin wiki site and it took off from there, being posted and talked about on various bitcoin forums.  The company is cash-flow positive and takes payment before the cow has even left the farm.  For bitcoin customers, there is an API on the website showing real-time values in US dollars, but David checks bitcoinwatch.com before quoting a price.  “I take the last two weeks’ average price for the Australian market. There might even be a little back and forth, especially if the market is moving too quickly or it’s starting to fall away. We have a chat and come to an agreement,” he says.  One example he quotes is from during the March-April rally this year.  “Someone placed an order [when bitcoin was] at AU$145, they then hit AU$200 but he had already transferred them by that time. We sold about a quarter of the company’s bitcoin holdings when it went just above AU$200… The customer was happy in the end; by the time he got his beef, which was nine days later, the price was down at AU$80. We had sold our bitcoins so everyone was happy.”  He is looking to push forward with the bitcoin side of the business and his next step is to persuade suppliers to also accept bitcoin. He believes he is “very close” to achieving this.  One of the farmers he works with now takes 10% in bitcoin for every second animal. He added:  “It’s a lot to get your head around, if you’re not tech-savvy initially. But since 2011, they’ve watched the price climb and they’re slowly but surely coming to accept it.”  He admits he can start to evangelise about bitcoin when talking about it with friends and neighbours, but he is noticing people become increasingly interested.  “They’re fascinated and horrified at the same time,” he says. “They love the benefits that it yields, but because it’s computer code, they worry about hacking and so-forth so then I have to start a spiel on cryptography.”  There are three people he has managed to get excited about bitcoin and they are his children.  [post-quote]  “They have their own little stash that I control and they’re constantly asking the price,” David says. “That day it went up to AU$266 and then went back down to AU$100, I had to tell them they had lost $1,000, you should have seen their faces.”  He is not just talking about spreading the word on bitcoin either.  “We are considering giving away bitcoin to new clients, or having a month where we give away maybe a quarter of a bitcoin when people place an order so they can get started in bitcoin land,” says David. “We’re thinking of how we can get it to them and emailing them an information pack.”  David trusts bitcoin will continue to rise in value. “Either it will be spectacular or it will be a spectacular crash,” he says, but he is betting on the former. “It’ll be worth $200 by the end of the year,” he predicts, “and $1,000 by the end of 2014.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Louise Goss,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/02/beefing-up-profits-farmer-achieves-20-bitcoin-sales,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e55ff131f8cc85b8c34c363e96c31ea56f3d6308-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376598,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bOyJ,1380708044,Why ZeroAccess botnet stopped bitcoin mining,"There have been several reports this week detailing how security firm Symantec took down a large portion of a bitcoin mining botnet called ZeroAccess. What few, if any, mention is that the bitcoin mining part of the botnet hasn't been functional for almost six months, because the developers deliberately killed it. The question is, why?      ZeroAccess is a piece of malware that joins an infected computer to a large network of similarly compromised machines. They can then be controlled by a central administrator, commonly called a botherder, who then gets the machines to do his bidding.      Most botnets follow predictable criminal practices, using victims' computers to send spam, or simply harvesting sensitive information on the infected machines, so that cybercriminals can use them to steal money. Others are used for click fraud, in which machines are made to click on profitable online links.      ZeroAccess was different, because it included a bitcoin mining module. The software used infected computers' CPUs to mine for bitcoins, returning the profits to the botherders.      ZeroAccess isn’t a new botnet - Symantec first saw it in the summer of 2011, according to Vikram Thakur, a research with Symantec Security Response. The next major revision emerged a year later, with minor revisions found in between.      But something significant happened in April this year, he said, going on to explain:      “ZeroAccess deprecated the bitcoin mining module back in April 2013. The botnet harnessed the hashing power of all those bots until April 2013 and then pushed out an update which effectively removed the mining module. No mining has happened on the ZeroAccess network since then.""              Why would botherders kill a software module which was causing a lot of machines to happily churn out bitcoins?      Many technically astute people reading this will jump to the obvious conclusion, which is that CPU mining is pointless, given the high difficulty caused by the rapidly increasing hash rate on the network. This in turn is being caused by a flood of ASIC mining hardware which is pushing GPUs out of the picture, let alone computationally anaemic CPUs.      Symantec even does the math, taking a relatively old test computer as an example. It used a 2Gb, 3.4GHz Dell OptiPlex GX620 Pentium D machine to see how well the malware might cause it to mine. It used 136.25 Watts per hour to mine at 1.5Mh/sec. Put that next to the machines that KnC Miner just started shipping and it’s like watching a Reliant Robin next to a Ducati.      Gregory Maxwell, one of the core dev team for bitcoin, says that a fast CPU does in the region of 1MH/GHz, meaning that a fast quad core 3GHz machine might do 12MH/s. But are newer machines likely to be among the infected?      “At least in the past, my impression has been that botnet machines tended to be older machines (less likely to have current patches), so more like a single core 2GHz machine— or 1.5Mh/s,” he said.      Even if faster machines are infected, they’re not likely to be using all of their power for mining. These hash rate estimates assume that the computers will be entirely idle, all of the time.      So in practice, the botnet isn’t likely to have a significant effect on the network, argues Maxwell. 1.9 million 1.5 MH/s hosts only equate to around 2.85 TH/s. The network is already hashing at over 1 Petahash per second, which means that this botnet is small potatoes.      But none of this actually matters, thanks to the vast number of users who don’t understand basic IT security and get infected on a regular basis. In ZeroAccess’s case, there were 1.9 million of them.      Let’s assume – for the criminals’ benefit – that the partial CPU utilization and the infection of more powerful machines cancel each other out, and that the average hash rate for the 1.9 million machines on the network was indeed 1.5Mh/sec. The average computer would earn around 41 cents per year, according to Symantec. But 1.9 million of them would mint thousands of dollars per day for the criminals. That’s easy money. Why turn it off?      Thakur has some ideas. The first is bad mining workflow. “The mining pool server had a static domain, which could have been taken down by law enforcement if someone reported the botnet's activities; maybe the botmaster was afraid of being tracked down as a result of having a static domain as part of the payload infrastructure,” he said.      However, there’s a more likely scenario in his mind, which is a basic case of economics. Even if the botherders were making money from illicit mining, they could be making more money, less transparently, making it a basic question of where best to spend the computing power.      Thakur suggests:      “The botmaster did not make nearly as much money through bitcoin mining (think difficulty factor) as compared to click fraud.            Tracking down fraud within the advertising networks is very difficult, making it more lucrative to hide profits behind such an infrastructure.”              These are all educated guesses, and until someone nabs the botherders and interrogates them, we’ll never know for sure.      Our guess is that it’s a combination of the two, and also possibly a knee-jerk reaction to market movements. The botherders quashed the bitcoin mining function in April, when interest in bitcoin reached an all-time high, and when the currency crashed from $266 to $40. Perhaps they decided that the currency value didn’t warrant the extra CPU cycles at that point.      We’re betting that the mining module doesn’t get reactivated now that network hashing power is skyrocketing. Symantec has also just put half a million of the machines out of action in a neat technical move known as sinkholing. The case for reintroducing it is constantly shrinking.      On the other hand, as soon as litecoin – the predominant coin based on the CPU-friendly Scrypt network – reaches mainstream awareness and captures the botherder's attention, we can expect to see botnets taking full advantage. If it happens, that will be a couple of years out.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | LTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/02/why-zeroaccess-botnet-stopped-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ffa1032126c582d914107d583e57f5d1b8d746fa-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
