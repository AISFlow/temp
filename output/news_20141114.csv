42377797,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bk5,1416003309,How Koinify and Melotic Plan to Bring Order to Crypto Crowdsales,"Though the crypto 2.0 segment of the bitcoin community is maturing, the part of the industry principally concerned with non-financial or advanced blockchain applications has struggled to develop a stable marketplace for its projects.  In the absence of strong VC interest, or perhaps in the spirit of pushing the boundaries of innovation, many decentralized applications (DApps) are seeking to fund themselves through what may arguably be the blockchain's most compelling use beyond currency, decentralized product backing in the vein of Kickstarter.  DApps seek to harness the ability of blockchains to create tokens, which can then be distributed and used to incentivize the product's development and adoption. The most notable example may be MaidSafe's $7m crowdsale, which this summer was greeted with controversy and skepticism in both the mainstream media and the wider community as it suffered from market forces and liquidity issues.  Even those who are striving to provide market solutions acknowledge that in the Wild West of bitcoin, DApps are still a comparatively uncharted territory.  ""If you were just to look at the crypto 2.0 space and see all the assets people are listing on Counterparty or NXT or any of these 2.0 platforms, the spirit of decentralization is openness and transparency,"" said Jack Wang, founder and CEO of digital asset liquidity exchange Melotic. ""The flip side is there's a lot more capability for people to push untrustworthy products.""  To solve this market problem, Wang and his company are entering a new partnership with DApp crowdfunding platform Koinify. Together, Koinify and Melotic are seeking to curate a marketplace that can enable the successful launch of new products and the eventual exchange of their tokens on an open market.  ""Previously when you purchased something in Kickstarter, it was just a donation or purchase, so there was no liquidity,"" Koinify CEO and founder Tom Ding said. ""In a token economy, you get a more sustainable charity, you can support a software but you can also have exits.""  Ultimately, the two platforms believe that together they can form a decentralized AngelList, one that enables communities to support and grow innovative projects, while enjoying new freedoms over the money they choose to provide.  Reducing the signal-to-noise ratio  Both Ding and Wang spoke to CoinDesk about the partnership, acknowledging that their main aspiration is to bring clarity to an already vibrant crowdsale marketplace, one that they argue has been turning away potentially interested participants.  ""The problem is the signal-to-noise ratio is really high,"" Ding said. ""There are too many noises and it becomes really hard for people who want to invest or purchase good, high-quality projects, tokens, to differentiate a good from a bad one.""  Ding said that Koinify will also seek to add transparency to the DApp funding process, ensuring that projects are vetted and rightly incentivized.  ""If the project sells out, makes $6m and got all of it in cash or bitcoin, they may not have the incentive to deliver a product,"" Ding continued. ""Part of our job is to help them establish things like multisig and create milestones-based vesting to make sure that developer incentives are in line with what they promised.""  Wang noted that Melotic aims to provide the second part of this pipeline, ensuring that there is liquidity in the DApp exchange markets by looking for funding sources for projects, including larger sources of capital.  Striving for self-regulation  Ding also noted the recent rumors that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may be taking a closer look at the crypto 2.0 marketplace, asserting that until formal guidelines are more clear, the space should strive to enforce its own consumer protections.  ""I think even some of the regulatory rumors recently might be a positive thing in that it forces people to think harder,"" he continued. ""Is it okay to announce the concept and start raising money? Or should developers deliver something more solid?""  For now, he said, this need for self-regulation means that Koinify must be selective about the projects it onboards, even if that requires it to become a more centralized manager of its platform.  ""If you have a limited selection, the amount of capital that comes into those markets is high quality,"" he said. ""When you have a really competitive market, with a really high standard or projects coming in, the problem will solve itself. We want to encourage talented developers into decentralized applications.""  Ding indicated that Koinify will also seek to educate developers, investing time and resources now to help them navigate the infrastructure for creating DApps.  First launch announced  Koinify and Melotic will begin testing their market approach with the launch of Koinify's first project on 1st December, the token sale for decentralized social messaging service Gems, which was unveiled at Inside Bitcoins Tel Aviv this October.  Ding used Gems as an example to show how Koinify aims to sheppard projects to successful launches, noting that the project satisfied an estimated 30–40 diligence questions that covered everything from technology to team structure.  ""We had a lot of discussion regarding what is a fair model for distributing Gems tokens, then we worked on developing the milestones that Gems should deliver,"" he said, adding that Koinify even flew to Israel to meet with the Gems team.  Ding indicated that Gems' first milestone will be the iOS version of its app, the second its Android version and the third the delivery of its ads platform. Once reached, each milestone will allow Gems to receive a new portion of the funds it raises in its pre-sale.  ""We could have a community-based vote where unless you deliver a solid beta version, we will not release the bitcoin that you've raised,"" Ding added, speculating on how Koinify might deal with bad actors on its platform.  High-stakes debut  Though both Ding and Wang spoke at length about how their platforms could disrupt or supplement traditional VC funding, they both acknowledged that the risks will be high for both of their brands early on.  ""The stakes are much higher,"" Wang explained, ""because there are much fewer projects. But, we're trying to find out if companies can gain additional value from token sales that allow their business model to change and allow them to fund their ideas and concepts separate from a VC model.""  Ding went on to suggest that some of the projects it is speaking with are seeking to raise funds both from VCs and from token sales, noting that there is a belief that a successful token sale can even increase VC interest.  However, both stressed that, for now, token sales provide developers with an enticing way to grow their userbase, something Ding expects will be a powerful incentive that will enable Koinify and Melotic to grow.  He concluded:  ""Every startup knows that the hardest part is zero to 1,000 users; 1,000 to 10,000 users. 10,000 users could very easily come form this kind of pre-sale. If you can get your first 10,000 users to crowdfund you, that's probably a good thing to build on.""

42377788,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73ba1,1415997642,Cryptowall Ransomware Nets $500 Bitcoin Payout From US Sheriff's Office,"A county sheriff’s office in Tennessee paid a $500 ransom in bitcoin after it became the victim of a cyberattack this week.  As reported by Nashville-based WTVF-TV, the Dickson County Sheriff's Office ran afoul of a bug known as Cryptowall, a derivative of infamous ransomware CryptoLocker.  Cryptowall is a Trojan horse program that, once inside a computer, encrypts its contents and triggers demands for a payment in bitcoin. The firm’s estimates suggest that after being discovered earlier this year, as many as 1,000 computers have been infected.  Detective and sheriff’s office IT director Jeff McCliss told WTVF-TV that a data cache containing sensitive documents, photographs and criminal reports was impacted. Overall, more than 70,000 files were temporarily inaccessible due to the malware infection.  ""Every sort of document that you could develop in an investigation was in that folder. There was a total of 72,000 files,” he said.  Subsequent investigation involving the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US military reportedly produced no solutions. Ultimately, the sheriff’s office was forced to pay the ransom in order to regain access to the files.  No good solutions  According to investigators, issues started last month when an employee at the sheriff's office inadvertently downloaded the malware by clicking on an online ad. McCliss told the Nashville-based news program that the office was not actively targeted.  After consulting both state and federal-level investigators – with some help from the military – McCliss concluded that the best course of action would be to pay the ransom. Otherwise, he told WTVF-TV, the sherrif’s office risked losing valuable ground on a number of cases, as well as access to needed information.  He explained:  ""Is it better to take a stand and lose all that information? Or make the payment grit your teeth and just do it? It made me sick to have to do that.""  McCliss said that he still has many questions surrounding the malware infection, and that as a result, the choice to pay the ransom wasn’t the easiest decision he has had to make.  “It's a very bad feeling,” he said.  Cryptowall's reach grows  Cryptowall has gained notoriety in recent months for its strong encryption method and global reach.  Earlier this week, Hawaii-based news source KHON 2 reported that the CryptoLocker derivative had infected some computers located in Honolulu. At the time, local law enforcement officials urged both residents and business owners to both back up their files and maintain robust anti-malware measures.  A report published last month by security firm Proofpoint suggested that popular online search destinations have have been utilized to boost distribution of the malware.  According to the study, advertisements on websites like Yahoo! and AOL, as well as a number of other online publications were used as unwitting delivery vehicles for Cryptowall. The practice, known as “malvertising”, has contributed to the success of the malware and led to the Tennessee malware infection.

42377795,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bip,1415993419,Australian Government: Welfare Applicants Must Declare Bitcoin Assets,"A small addition to a pension application form provoked interest in Australia yesterday, with its request that applicants declare their ""cyber currency"" assets such as bitcoin.  A printed reference to bitcoin value in a government-issed document such as this, according to a digital currency legal expert, ""legitimizes the concept of digital wealth beyond a niche area"".  On page 14 of the application form published by the Department of Human Services (DHS), bitcoin is listed alongside other potentially valuable assets: ""taxi plates, time shares, racehorses, greyhounds, travellers cheques"" and collectables such as stamps, wine, art and fishing licences.  Amor Sexton, a Sydney-based lawyer with digital currency specialist firm Adroit Lawyers, told CoinDesk bitcoin's appearance on the form was subtle yet significant.  She said:  ""The concept of 'digital property' or 'digital assets' may seem straightforward but it actually challenges some of the fundamental rules of property law. This recognition of cryptocurrency as an asset is an evolution of property law and the concept of wealth.""  Intangible assets, up to now, had rights that could be enforced – such as intellectual property – but could not be easily traded. They had value and could even be taxed, but they weren't considered to be 'wealth'.  Bitcoin becoming mainstream  By including bitcoin and other digital currencies on one of its standard forms, the national government is recognizing these are indeed forms of wealth, and they have also become mainstream as wealth.  Jason Williams, who heads Australia's local Bitcoin Foundation chapter the Bitcoin Association of Australia, said the organization is ""delighted"" by bitcoin's inclusion and recognition by a federal government department.  He agreed the government is making a clear statement legitimizing the concept of cyber currency as form of wealth, and was no longer treating it as a niche.  ""Not only does this legitimize bitcoin as a form of wealth, the very inclusion of bitcoin into official government documents indicates there is real effort by the government into understanding and realising cyber currencies in general, and bitcoin in particular, are technologies that are set to be a permanent part of our financial landscape.""  Australia has established itself as one of the world's most bitcoin-friendly jurisdictions, attempting to understand and accept digital currencies as part of mainstream finance.  A Senate inquiry into bitcoin will present its findings to parliament in March 2015 and, although its rulings have been questioned by some in the industry as confusing and potentially double-taxing, the Australian Tax Office has also made several statements on digital currency and attempted to integrate it into the current tax regime.

42377785,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bUz,1415988014,eGifter Arrives in the European Gift Card Market,"US-based online and mobile gifting company eGifter has announced its expansion into the European market.  Notably, the move coincides with a similar announcement last week by UK-based Pockio and sees both companies offering their services in the UK, France and Germany. Both companies have also aired plans to enter other markets in the very near future.  EGifter  's co-founder and CEO, Tyler Roye, told CoinDesk:  ""We are looking at adding the rest of Western Europe, as well as markets where English is the primary language, in early 2015, if not sooner. We are also entering some markets as a platform provider, helping incumbent players deploy our best-of-breed mobile and social e-gift card technology to power their own consumer distribution channels.""  The company allows gift cards to be purchased with cryptocurrency or standard payment methods, which can then be redeemed on the appropriate retailer's website. Effectively, as well as providing gifting services, the service lets bitcoin holders shop with retailers that do not yet accept digital currencies.  Growth plans  While Pockio offers customers the chance to pay for gift cards in any of 15 cryptocurrencies, eGifter currently accepts bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin in the US, and just bitcoin internationally. The firm also accepts PayPal and credit cards, and plans to add additional payment options in Q1 2015 for both US and international markets.  The initial phase of expansion sees Amazon.fr, Amazon.de and Amazon.co.uk as the company's sole EU offerings.  Roye said:  “Working with Amazon was a natural fit, given the strong demand for their gift card around the world ... As for new brands, we are in talks with many retailers and don’t disclose them until they are live. We are committed to adding brands as quickly as possible [in the EU] as we have demonstrated in the US market.”  The company finds itself in a position of playing catch-up, however. Pockio currently offers 177 retailers for shoppers in the UK, including Ryanair, Marks & Spencer and Spotify, with fewer options for its French and German users.  Roye indicated his company's advantages will still appeal to consumers, however, saying:  ""First, in the US we offer both web and mobile app access to our cards, offering both a low-friction and feature-rich gifting experience in the same app. Today, European consumers can use our mobile website to purchase cards from their mobile devices, and we will be launching Android and iOS mobile apps in Europe very soon.""  Additionally, eGifter's mobile apps are integrated with popular digital wallets such as Apple Passbook, Samsung Wallet and, soon, Google Wallet, he pointed out.  Doing things 'by the book'  Roye also indicated that eGifter connects to each brand either directly or via their processor and pulls digital gift cards in real-time. This enables the firm to offer variable-denomination cards that can be purchased in ""one-penny"" increments, meaning consumers can buy a gift card on their mobile phone for the exact amount of their purchase, and use it at the point of sale.  ""We take the time to become an authorized reseller; doing things 'by the book' with the brands [to protect] our customers,"" he said.  In the US, the firm continues to include new retailers in its marketplace, recently adding Best Buy, Whole Foods, TJ Maxx and others.  Roye said:  ""We are also getting strong adoption of our white-label platform, recently launching on Applebee’s website, bringing our total to more than 20 brands on the platform. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency sales grow every month and we expect to see record levels this holiday season.""

42377792,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bcX,1415980255,CFPB Could Demand Consumer Protections for Digital Wallets,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has published a set of proposals that could impact cryptocurrency users.  Its 870-page report, published 13th November, is largely focused on prepaid debit cards, but some provisions in the document may apply to cryptocurrency wallets too.  Regulations may apply to all digital wallets  The bureau is still seeking comment on its proposed definition of ‘prepaid accounts’ and admits that the document remains a work-in-progress.  While most of its proposal deals with cards, however, the CFPB notes that it could apply to digital currencies as well:  “The Bureau also recognizes that the proposed rule may have potential application to virtual currency and related products and services. As a general matter, however, the Bureau’s analysis of mobile financial products and services, as well as and virtual currencies and related products and services, including the applicability of existing regulations and this proposed regulation to such products and services, is ongoing. The proposed rule does not specifically resolve these issues.”  There are significant variations in the way digital wallets hold funds and process payments, the CFPB states.  Most allow users to store their bank account, debit card, credit card or prepaid credit card credentials on mobile devices. Some allow consumers to store funds directly, or by funding a prepaid product that can be used to withdraw funds, it says.  CFPB already accepts digital currency complaints  The bureau issued an advisory on digital currencies back in August, warning US consumers about the potential dangers of the bitcoin ecosystem. It also began accepting consumer complaints regarding digital currencies.  At the time the CFPB told CoinDesk that it was actively working to understand how digital currencies and other emerging technologies affect consumer protections. The bureau said it would continue to carefully monitor the development of digital currencies and take appropriate steps if necessary.  Judging by the latest set of proposals, the bureau has not changed its position on digital currencies – they remain under examination.

42377787,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bXV,1415970969,Bank of Canada Keeping 'Close Eye' on Digital Currencies,"The Bank of Canada is ""keeping a close eye"" on risks posed by new forms of electronic money, according to a new statement released Thursday.  The statement is based on remarks made by the bank’s senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins at a university event in Waterloo, Ontario.  During the event Wilkins discussed two different types of electronic money: those denominated in national currencies and backed by their issuer and cryptocurrencies with no issuer, such as bitcoin.  Wilkins noted the potential risks and benefits of digital currencies, concluding that bitcoin remains outside the mainstream and, as such, does not pose a serious threat to Canada's financial stability.  Adoption too low to threaten stability  The deputy governor pointed out that digital currency technology enables users to circumvent old payments platforms, creating ""new efficiencies and new risks"" along the way.  “People who use these technologies need to be aware of the risk of putting their trust in an e-money scheme that is lightly regulated with limited or no user protection,” Wilkins told students at Wilfrid Laurier University.  There are about 340 Canadian merchants willing to accept bitcoin, along with an estimated 76,000 merchants in other parts of the world, she said.  “Some merchants may be accepting it, but it has yet to gain much traction with people making purchases. There aren’t a lot of data on this, but what we do have indicate that last year there were around 70,000 bitcoin transactions per day across the globe. This pales in comparison with the more than 21 million debit and credit card transactions that occur each day in Canada alone,” said Wilkins.  She said many people are not interested in bitcoin because it has “serious flaws” when it comes to satisfying the three main characteristics of money – a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account.  Wilkins also pointed out that Canadians still prefer debit cards and cash over digital currencies, adding that emerging digital currencies do not pose a material risk to financial stability in Canada at this time:  “That said, money and payments technology is progressing in leaps and bounds, and so the Bank of Canada is watching developments closely.”  Hypothetical risks  Wilkins warned that there could be ramifications if digital currencies were to gain widespread acceptance, but she described such a scenario as ""unlikely"":  ""In the unlikely situation in which cryptocurrencies were used broadly, a significant proportion of economic transactions would not be denominated in Canadian dollars. This would reduce the bank's ability to influence macroeconomic activity through Canadian interest rates.""  The Bank of Canada said digital currencies have the potential to alter the fundamental payments architecture around the world, hence they could pose risks to individuals and the Canadian financial system as a whole. Wilkins said the country was still nowhere near that point.  The bank issued a similar statement in May, saying that digital currencies could destabilise global finance, but only in theory. In a separate statement, the bank said it was not concerned by the advent of digital currencies.  Innovation offers some benefits  Wilkins added that money and payments are “at the core” of central banking. She also confirmed that the Bank of Canada is researching the potential benefits of “issuing e-money"".  “There is little doubt that these innovations have some benefits. They give us more choice about how we make purchases, and can reduce the cost of certain transactions. Think about online purchases of pictures or songs,” she said.  She added that digital currencies could be useful for small transactions, cross-border commerce, remittances and other niches.  “E-money has some benefits in certain economies, especially when cash is not a viable option,” said Wilkins.  However, Wilkins concluded that individuals need to be aware of the risks of using e-money, since it is not subject to oversight and consumer protection standards.  Open-minded approach  Canada has a comparatively liberal regulatory framework and in the past it has taken steps to ensure free development of cryptocurrency businesses.  Earlier this year, the Parliament of Canada passed a bill amending the country’s AML framework, extending it to digital currency businesses. The bill regulates bitcoin business as money services businesses, imposing a number of reporting and record keeping requirements.  The bill gave digital currency businesses ample time to prepare and most Canadian firms in the cryptocurrency space say they expected the changes.

42377790,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73bdn,1415964674,Western Union CIO: Bitcoin No Solution for Today's Market,"For Western Union chief information officer John “David” Thompson, bitcoin represents an innovative technology that, if successful, could significantly impact the way people transact and exchange information.  Yet the path he sees to that future is fogged by regulatory and cultural challenges that are yet to be resolved.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Thompson detailed how he invested in bitcoin mining in order to learn more about nuts and bolts of the technology – a process that he continues to this day.  “I have some [KnCMiner] Neptunes – about two terahashes in bitcoin mining,” he said. “It’s done well.”  Thompson said he began mining both personally and professionally to see what the technology could do and if Western Union could potentially benefit from its implementation.  Still, while there is potential in certain applications of the technology, he said, it remains to be seen whether bitcoin moves past being what he called “a solution looking for a problem to solve.”  Western Union, he said, is interested in seeing how the technology grows amid an evolving regulatory environment. As a global company, he explained, Western Union looks at a landscape of hundreds of legal jurisdictions, each with their own specific standards on money transmission and transaction oversight.  Thompson continued:  “Bitcoin as a technology doesn’t solve any problems for us in the core of our business. Our challenge is the last mile. How do I get that money in the person's hand, and meet all the regulatory compliance needs in that country? So, I don’t really need it for the minimum. Moving a bit from Point A to Point B isn’t hard. The last mile is really hard.”  At the same time, Thompson told CoinDesk that Western Union is open to the technology and will continue observing its development to see if it can provide solutions to challenges it faces.  Consumer adoption questions  Thompson said that Western Union likely won’t take active steps to integrate bitcoin until it sees demand from its customers. For now, according to Thompson, there isn’t any interest on the part of the company’s global customer base to make the company take that next step.  “To me, it’s one more funding vehicle, one more payout vehicle. And, to be honest, our digital savvy customers are probably going to be the first customer base asking for it.”  [post-quote]  Thompson continued: “But that doesn't mean that we aren’t looking at it, how we enable [usage] legally, what licenses we need in addition to what we have. In the context of regulation, New York is starting to have this dialogue. Opening comments are out there on the licensing scheme. This is one state – we operate in 220 countries.”  Thompson cited fiduciary duty to both shareholders and customers as a reason to look at new and innovative technologies – but not at the expense of profitability. At the same time, he reiterated that it’s too early to tell how or why the company would integrate bitcoin.  Calling it an “infant technology”, he said that the industry needs to be developed further and that questions surrounding its legal status must be answered.  “I do think there is promise there,” he said. “There should be investments.”  Thompson said that Western Union is actively looking at the technology, conducting studies on whether some of the issues they experience on a global level could be mediated by digital currency.  Search for use case continues  Thompson also addressed the issues that have dogged the remittance industry in certain developing global markets, where the risks of serving customers has caused providers to stop services.  Despite potentially lowering the cost of remittance providers to extend service to these areas, he said this is only one challenge for the industry. Rather, he isn’t convinced that bitcoin can solve fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing – issues that create challenges for businesses in the market and deter new entrants entirely.  Thompson explained:  “Bitcoin as a technology, as a capability, doesn’t mitigate any of those concerns. It doesn’t offer anything of value in addition to that marketplace. You still have the regulatory issues, you still have the fraud prevention issues, the consumer protection issues in that marketplace. So, I don’t see a connection there to make that market better with bitcoin.”  On a broader level, Thompson noted he wasn’t convinced that bitcoin will succeed on a global scale as a remittance pipeline. Instead, he foresees regional usage within smaller markets where usage isn’t hampered by the challenges of cross-border transacting, saying:  “It might be a niche product, a niche capability for domestic money transfer. But for global money transfer, does it add value? Does it really solve that last-mile problem? Does it solve regulatory concerns? Does it get better visibility? Does it reduce risk? In my mind, those are still questions to be answered.”  “There’s promise there, but I wouldn’t put my money on it yet,” he added.  Transparency needed to grow adoption  That said, Thompson said that there were ways that the remittance industry can change to help facilitate global bitcoin adoption. Above all else, he advocated for transparency on both the development side as well as the transaction authentication side.  Saying that he likes the concept of an open global ledger, he argued that aspects of the market “cannot hide behind a shield of technology”.  “You have to be transparent in financial transactions,” he said.  Thompson continued:  “I think if it we can get this to a level where it’s a truly global ledger, fully identified entities, then it can have promise. But I think there’s going to be groups popping up around KYC, groups popping up around anti-fraud. There could be investments in that area.”  He also noted that the the growth of alternative digital currencies and other protocol implementations means that the community itself is still in an active period of development. According to Thompson, this reflects the evolution of nearly all other new technologies and that it’s unclear where the industry itself is headed.  Research, investment for Thompson to continue  While Western Union will continue its stance of observation and study, Thompson said he plans on continuing to both buy bitcoin and expand his mining capabilities.  “I’m going to continue to invest a portion of my income into mining and exploring opportunities with it, understanding the marketplace,” he said.  He called the industry itself “ripe for opportunity and innovation” and said that Western Union has an interest in seeing digital currency grow and develop, adding.  “From a Western Union perspective, it’s watch, learn - potentially encourage some innovation in certain areas that could potentially solve a problem for us. Encouraging innovation in areas where we can truly have a problem solved is awesome.”  Images via Western Union, Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/14/western-union-cio-bitcoin-no-solution-for-todays-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f0dd6eb4093e0ac901bd5da6f3880e4c47aa04ad-1234x561.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
