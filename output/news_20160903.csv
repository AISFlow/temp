42427061,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJysRh,1472921554,The Blockchain is Perfect for Government Services,"As government services are one of the most obvious and immediate application areas for the blockchain, it's no surprise progressive governments are already working on initiatives.  In the first half of 2016, cities, municipalities and governments have been vocal in their plans for the technology.  Indeed, a quick overview of the projects in development shows how far the idea that blockchain could change government services has spread around the globe:  Delaware  In Delaware, the state where a majority of new companies will likely incorporate, Governor Jack Markell announced two blockchain initiatives in May at CoinDesk's Consensus 2016 event.  As detailed by the governor, the first effort is focused on moving state archival records to an open distributed ledger, and the second allows any private company that incorporates in that state to keep track of equity and shareholder rights on the blockchain.  At the time, Markell declared Delaware is ""open for blockchain business"", and hopefully, 2016 will see continued progress made in delivering on this promise.  Singapore  On the other side of the world in Singapore, the government has turned to blockchain for different reasons.  There, the city-state is seeking to prevent traders from defrauding banks, driven by an incident where Standard Chartered lost nearly $200m from a fraud in China’s Qingdao port two years ago.  Here, fraudulent companies used duplicate invoices for the same goods to get hundreds of millions of dollars from banks, so the Singapore government developed a system with the local banks focused on preventing invoice fraud by using the blockchain to create a unique cryptographic hash (a unique fingerprint) of every invoice.  The banks share this unique key, rather than the raw data. If another bank tries to register an invoice with the same details, the system will be alerted.  Estonia  Long one of the more progressive digital governments, Estonia has established an e-residency program where anyone in the world can apply to become an e-resident of Estonia.  In return, residents receive a digital ID card with a cryptographic key to securely sign digital documents, eliminating the need for ink signatures on official paperwork.  An e-resident can also open bank accounts using Estonia's e-banking system, set up an Estonian company using the country's online system and use their e-services. With the blockchain, Estonia is bringing worldwide residents to them virtually, and gaining new revenue streams accordingly.  Estonia also has a healthcare initiative where medical records are tracked, and as a patient, you know who looked at your record and when. This puts you in control of your own data, and you have transparency about the medical care you are getting.  Georgia, Ghana and Sweden  Another emerging area of focus is in government land registries.  The Republic of Georgia, for example, is developing a blockchain project focused on this goal and spearheaded by their National Agency of Public Registry. They want to show that Georgia is corruption free, modern and transparent government.  Another land registry application is taking shape in Ghana, West Africa, where they are implementing it in 28 communities to enable tamper-resistant property ownerships.  Again, the driving element was to make a statement against the perception that the country had corrupt practices, and this initiative is used as a signal to attract foreign investors.  Sweden is planning to place real estate transactions on the blockchain so that all parties involved in the transactions – banks, government, brokers, buyers and sellers – would be able to track the progress of the agreement once it is completed. This will enable instantaneous confirmation of valid transactions with the utmost levels of security and integrity.  UK  The UK is exploring the use of a blockchain to manage the distribution of grants. Monitoring and controlling the use of grants is incredibly complex, and subject to potential fraud or abuse.  A blockchain, accessible to all the parties involved, is a better way of solving that problem.  Activity areas  If your government, county, municipality, town, city or jurisdiction is not thinking about the blockchain, they should be.  There is plenty of room for innovation, especially in small cities and municipalities, as they are a perfect starting point.  Given the early stage of blockchain technology, it is a lot easier to implement solutions at smaller scales first, in jurisdictions that have between five to 300,000 citizens, instead of larger cities of more than a million inhabitants.  As a government entity, what can you do with the blockchain? Generically, there are four categories of activity:  Verification. Licenses, proofs of records, transactions, processes or events. Did this event take place? Was this service performed on this piece of equipment? Does this person have the right permit?  Movement of assets. Transferring money from one person/entity to another. Enabling direct payments, once a work condition has been performed.  Ownerships. Land registries, property titles, and any type of real estate ownership. The blockchain is a perfect keeper of the chain of custody for any physical asset.  Identities. Government, cities should issue blockchain e-identities to its citizens, enabling them to securely use services like voting. An e-identity could become similar to a passport, allowing its holder access to a variety of services and rights.  Next steps  But, how do we get there? And what actions can the government take?  Government leaders should:  Get up to speed on the blockchain by understanding it first, and committing to exploring its potential.  Put people in charge of developing a blockchain strategy. Maybe there are employees that have been exploring it already, and they need to spread their wings and gain legitimacy with new projects.  Start experimenting with blockchain technology via proofs of concept, sandboxes and small projects that do no harm.  Develop new and more progressive ideas that are increasingly ambitious, and touch the lives of the citizens they are serving.  Make a difference. Commit to introducing innovative blockchain-based solutions that cut costs and provide better or faster services to citizens.  Let’s hope the public sector around the world starts putting the blockchain on their agenda. Maybe then, we can see a significant difference in how government services are delivered.

42427079,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyt1h,1472902128,Credit Unions Seek to Become First to Market With Banking Blockchain,"The credit union industry is following the lead of hackers and thieves, according to Jeff Johnson, chief information officer at Illinois-based Baxter Credit Union (BCU).  ""This is going to sound strange,"" he said. ""[But] criminals, no matter how much you hate them, are really smart people. They take the path of least resistance.""  In his mind, if it’s working for international payments on the black market, there has to be a way to leverage the technology for above-board use that is just as robust, anonymous and secure.  It's one of the reasons BCU has joined 55 other credit unions and four of the largest credit union service organizations (CUSOs) on the CU Ledger blockchain project, led by the Credit Union National Association (CUNA) and Mountain West Credit Union Association (MWCUA).  The ongoing effort, those involved say, is similar to work being conducted at major consortium projects launched by big banks. For example, R3CEV has attracted more than 40 traditional financial institutions for trials that have focused on applying the tech to commercial paper and trade finance.  But while R3 has garnered more attention, CU Ledger believes it has a better chance of pushing technology through to commercial production first, due to the cooperative nature of credit unions.  ""The two basic [blockchain] concepts are scale and security, and we've together credit unions representing enough members so that when we get this going we should be able to scale quickly,"" said Rich Meade, chief of staff and chief operating officer at CUNA.  He added:  ""Plus, to have the four CUSOs collaborate on something hasn’t happened for a long time. This could be big, getting all those people at the table.""  The credit union advantage  To Meade, this is setting up a David and Goliath-type dynamic, one where the smaller, nimbler and smarter participant might prove more adept at succeeding at its goals more quickly.  ""We focus on individual people, while they focus on commercial entities,"" Meade said, adding:  ""Credit unions have more to gain than to lose when looking at this opportunity. The competition among us isn’t big enough to push out [our] cooperative side.""  That competition in the traditional banking sector is fierce is one of the reasons many analysts have turned skeptical of the private financial blockchain projects. Since banks see their customer information as a competitive advantage, the incentives aren't there for banks to collaborate on blockchain, especially with high-dollar corporate customers.  Further, the collaboration necessary for distributed ledger systems to work is something credit unions have succeeded at before.  For instance, the industry created the CUNA Mutual Group, which provides commercial and consumer insurance and protection products, and CO-OP Shared Branchinghttps://www.co-opfs.org/solutions/atmbranch/co-op-shared-branching/, a national network of credit unions that share facilities so members have convenient locations to perform financial transactions.  The credit union industry also came together to form a technology standards body, CUFX, which developed standards for integrating software technology into existing credit union systems. CUFX went so far as to define the data fields (What is a member? What are the different loan types? Etc.) and specified how information is transmitted within credit union systems.  Software providers now have a standardized template for building for credit unions, making it faster and easier for them to plug into third-party software systems.  Furthermore, Meade is one of the better-suited candidates to steer CU Ledger, since he's built collaborative systems in the past. Before CUNA, as a consultant for the National Renal Administrators Association, he created a health information exchange that the US government eventually partnered with.  ""Financial services has many similarities to healthcare, for instance you're dealing with encrypted, very sensitive information,"" said Meade.  The use cases  Unlike many of the enterprise blockchain projects, CU Ledger's work will be consumer-facing.  After a meeting in Chicago last week, CU Ledger has started working with sovereign identity provider Evernym Inc to build an identity-related proof of concept on top of a permissioned blockchain.  ""Specifically in the credit union industry, one thing comes to mind is the whole digital identity, having a trusted identity owned by a member,"" BCU's Johnson said. ""It's important because we're being faced with increasing fraud and identity theft.""  Identity as it relates to ownership and privacy is a particularly hot topic today, and even more so in the credit union industry, which is focused on delivering better products and services to each individual member, Johnson said  Sovereign identity is the first track of the CU Ledger project, while the second will focus on scouring the blockchain industry to find the third-party provider that would be best to work with for the project in the long-term.  The plan is to have those two tracks meet in the middle by May of next year, with the proof-of-concept proven out and the top potential blockchain providers identified, Johnson said.  ""When we pick a blockchain technology, we have to feel comfortable that it's going to be around decades from now,” he said. ""If you think about the underlying guts of the technology, it has to be like the World Wide Web has been, because the storage of all the transactions needs to go on forever.""  Another reason for shopping around for providers is that the group is still unclear exactly which use case will pan out. Johnson also thinks blockchain could be used by credit unions to more efficiently communicate and transact within the CO-OP Shared Branching network.  Meade added that another application credit unions are interested in is whether blockchain could create a more efficient management of indirect auto lending.  ""Until you build the network, you don't know all the applications that could run on it,” said Meade. ""There’s been a lot of hype around blockchain, but I think this is a lot more than just hype.""  The CU Ledger group has had initial conversations with R3, but Meade said he wants the credit union industry to have its own platform.  ""It’s important for credit unions to build this out and not have something dictated to them by other people with their own pricing,” he said, concluding:  ""We want to create this as a utility for credit unions.""
