42397799,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAYu,1405812058,TNABC Day 1: Bitcoin Industry Seeks Plan of Attack for US Regulation,"Day one of the North American Bitcoin Conference in Chicago kicked off with the surprise debut of the Digital Chamber of Commerce plus a new bitcoin-focused lobbying group that will seek to advocate for bitcoin in Washington – and it didn't hold back from there.  Packing a diverse lineup of speakers and a loose community feel, the day saw no shortage of major announcements, including Blockchain's release of its new Android wallet app and OKCoin's announcement that it will soon offer USD deposits and withdrawals.  However, the most pervasive topic of the day was not any of these big moves by industry heavyweights or promising newcomers, but the fierce debate over New York's proposed regulations for bitcoin businesses released this week.  Speaking to CoinDesk, TNABC organiser Moe Levin suggested that it was intentional for the conference to address regulation, saying:  ""Regulation is one of those things where if it's done wrong, it could handicap everything. It's unfortunate that something can't just bloom and blossom, but we need the smartest people in the room to educate and work on fostering innovation.""  Though the topic was discussed on several panels, it was perhaps the day's final roundtable discussion – featuring prominent bitcoin lawyer Marco Santori, Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck and Texas Congressman Steve Stockman – that best illustrated the community's outrage at many of the specific rules the proposal would enforce.  ""This was a scattershot approach to [regulation]"" - @virtuallylaw, general counsel @BTCFoundation on New York's bitlicenses #bitcoinchicago — CoinDesk (@coindesk) July 19, 2014    There, the panelists largely sought to frame the regulation as a reactionary move that would threaten the ability of bitcoin to develop as freely as the Internet did two decades ago. Santori added that he fears the majority of the proposed rules would be passed, but he didn't rule out that a strong reaction from the bitcoin community could impact this outcome.  Additional first day speeches included talks from litecoin creator Charlie Lee and investor Trace Mayer, among others.  Regulation dampens VC spirits  In its late morning slot, the TNABC's VC panel showcased a number of big names from major investment firms, including Tally Capital's Matthew Roszak; Future Ventures' Alyse Killeen; Cryptocurrency Partners' Brock Pierce, and others.  At the session, panelists debated how quickly the bitcoin industry was likely to grow, whether enabling direct bitcoin investments would help nurture digital currency startups, and how entrepreneurs could best ensure their ideas were greeted favorably by VCs.  Still, it was regulation that took center stage when the topic of New York's proposed BitLicenses arose. Notably, CrossPacific Capital Partners managing partner Marc Van Der Chijs indicated that the proposal is enough for him to consider avoiding investments in US companies due to their high capital needs.    ""As far as the US is concerned, bitcoin is already regulated,"" @BrockPierce on the BitLicense proposal #bitcoinchicago — CoinDesk (@coindesk) July 19, 2014          Even if clarifying regulation is not forthcoming, however, Roszak's introductory remarks suggested that the VC community, or at least the more enterprising representatives assembled, would still be actively engaged in digital currency even if New York's regulation proposal passed with many of its provisions intact.  ""Despite all the morass and all the drama in the industry, people were still engaged deeply in the space and putting money to work.""  PayPal speaks out  Perhaps one of the most surprising moments of the show was when, in a break from the schedule, PayPal corporate strategist Roman Leal addressed the crowd with a representative from the Blockchain team.  There, Leal indicated he would be open to working with Blockchain and that bitcoin could even be leveraged to help PayPal improve its recently acquired payments gateway, Braintree.  Leal, who authored an earlier bitcoin report for Goldman Sachs before joining PayPal in May, added that PayPal wants to engage with the digital currency community, but that it still has reservations about the decision – ones that could block any immediate action.  Citing the lingering regulatory uncertainty hanging over the industry, Leal suggested it could be five to 10 years before PayPal begins working with bitcoin, depending on when this roadblock is resolved. However, Leal suggests as regulation becomes more certain, companies like PayPal will begin to seek out bitcoin projects, saying:  ""As those clouds dissipate, not just PayPal, but a lot of incumbents will start getting interested as well.""  Huobi hits US conference circuit  While Huobi proved a unique addition to the event's lineup, the company's speech passed with less fanfare than the later presentation by OKCoin CTO Changpeng Zhao.  By comparison, Huobi's slot was absent any large announcements about its operations. Filling in for Huobi CEO Leon Li, who was originally slated to appear at the conference, was Wendy Wang, who proceeded to provide a broad overview of the Chinese bitcoin market that focused on introducing attendees to the ecosystem's major players and honing in on statistics that illustrated those points.  Most Chinese bitcoin users are between the age of 30 and 39 years old, Huobi's @gogirl_wen says #bitcoinchicago — CoinDesk (@coindesk) July 19, 2014  OKCoin CEO Star Xu was also slated to appear before he was replaced by Zhao, meaning neither company's CEO succeeded in making their US conference debut.  International exhibitors show off  The conference's international feel was also on full display in the exhibition section, with a number of notable industry companies from outside the US installing booths in order to introduce their products to American business owners and consumers.  Booth displays included those by major digital currency exchanges such as Beijing-based Huobi and OKCoin plus bitcoin ATM manufacturer BitOcean, which has launched a bid to purchase the remaining assets of now-defunct Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  Also in attendance were consumer mining equipment manufacturer Butterfly Labs, merchant processor BitPay and block explorer and wallet provider Blockchain.

42397791,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAS1,1405809419,Bitcoin Exchange OKCoin to Launch USD Deposits and Withdrawals,"Beijing-based bitcoin exchange provider OKCoin has announced its latest strategic bid to move beyond Asia's markets and serve the global bitcoin community by announcing the planned launch of its new international exchange website.  The move will find the China-based company accepting USD deposits and processing USD withdrawals via OKCoin.com. OKCoin will also host servers for the new offering outside of China and provide English-language customer service.  Speaking to CoinDesk, OKCoin CTO Changpeng Zhao said:  ""The international site will be skewed very heavily to international users in the user experience. The customer credibility – we need to establish that over time, but I think that's going to come in a superior product.""  Zhao went on to say that the international site is going to be separate from the Chinese site, with separate order books. The company does not plan to register for money transmission licenses in the US immediately, meaning that the move finds OKCoin looking internationally, but not formally courting American customers.  The official unveiling took place during Changpeng Zhao's speech at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Chicago today and follows the 20th June launch of the company's algorithmic trading tools, a product that aims to help the company better target Wall Street investors.  International differences  Zhao said the two sites – OKCoin.cn and OKCoin.com – aim to satisfy the differing regional preferences of both groups of exchange users.  For example, Zhao noted that Western users prefer clean interfaces, those more comparable to Google, while China-based users, he said, favor more links on one page.  The former Blockchain head of development said:  ""It's those little things that actually matter, and we're still trying to figure out how to best satisfy both worlds. At the moment, we don't want to have two separate products, but later we may have different versions for different regions.""  He added that future products may account for regional trading preferences, noting that futures remain a popular product in China, while options are not as widely used.  China looks west  The Chicago conference played host to three notable Asia-based companies on Saturday, including OKCoin and Huobi, both of which had representatives speak as part of the event.  OKCoin CEO Star Xu and Huobi CEO Leon Li were both expected to lead these discussions, however, Li was replaced by Wendy Wang, while Xu was replaced by Zhao.  BitOcean, a China-based bitcoin ATM manufacturer that recently launched an initiative that will find it opening a Japan-based bitcoin exchange, also attended the event.

42397794,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAVx,1405801200,Blockchain Debuts Android Bitcoin Wallet with Merchant Directory,"Bitcoin wallet and block explorer provider Blockchain has unveiled its latest Android wallet update, announcing the news at The North American Bitcoin Conference (NABC), an ongoing two-day industry event taking place in downtown Chicago.  The official launch follows the release of early previews provided by the company in June, a leak that coincided with Blockchain's debut of its new customer onboarding tool, Bitcoin.com.  Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary framed the announcement as part of a broader update to the company's wallet service that will find it issuing more news through the summer. Combined, this initiative will help the company better meet the scale that it excepts as more consumers join the bitcoin ecosystem.  Cary said:  ""We're completely focused on creating simple and engaging experiences so we can go to web scale – supporting hundreds of millions of users.""  Notably, the updated Android wallet integrates with user address books and includes an in-app merchant map that can be leveraged to find bitcoin businesses.  Click below to view a gallery of app images:  Merchant mapping  One of the more novel aspects of the new app is its inclusion of a merchant directory that the company says uses a ""fully verified database"" to let users discover local businesses that accept bitcoin in a similar way as traditional merchant directories such as Yelp.  Images provided by Blockchain show that in-app business directory pages include the phone number, address and website of bitcoin companies, as well as a description of their services.  Users can also search an interactive map that includes five unique, color-coded pins to specify the nature of the business and its services.  Reimagining interaction  Keonne Rodriguez, Blockchain's product lead, said that the goal with the app redesign was to focus on user experience, and images show that personal finance management services may have influenced the final release.  For example, the wallet dashboard allows Android users to see their balance and divide their funds into categories such as ""Vacation"", ""Car"" or ""Savings"" to better manage their finances.  Additionally, the wallet will enable peer-to-peer transactions without the recipient needing an existing bitcoin wallet, providing bitcoin users with a way to bring more interested individuals into the ecosystem.  Conference update  The announcement followed a Saturday speech by Blockchain COO Peter Smith, who spoke opposite CoinSetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz at the NABC.  The event  also featured speeches from notable industry leaders such as BitPay senior software engineer Jeff Garzik, OKCoin CTO Changpeng Zhao and Bitcoin Shop CEO Charles Allen.  For more news and breaking announcements, follow CoinDesk's live Twitter coverage of the event.  Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that the event was attended by OKCoin CEO Star Xu. Xu has since been replaced by OKCoin CTO Changpeng Zhao.

42397801,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEATz,1405783007,Chamber of Digital Commerce Launches to Advance Bitcoin in Washington,"The latest edition of the North American Bitcoin Conference (NABC) kicked off today at McCormick Place in Chicago with the introduction of bitcoin's new government affairs office, a group that seeks to ensure the industry's interests are represented on Capitol Hill.  Called the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the nonprofit is being helmed by Perianne Boring, author of the weekly Forbes column 'The Boring Bitcoin Report' and a former congressional staff member.  Addressing a crowd of conference attendees, Boring laid out her vision for the new group with both force and humor, affirming that the organisation seeks to promote bitcoin's underlying values in Washington while stressing that this action is necessary to protect industry interests.  Accordingly, Boring took aim at even the most recent regulatory guidance from New York, stating:  ""These regulations were heavy handed, [and they] show that we need this. One mistake is taking existing regulations from the financial system and trying to impose them on digital currencies.""  Boring confirmed that the Chamber of Digital Commerce will raise a $120,000 seed round with the goal of achieving a $1.5m annual budget, and that it will seek to be transparent about its fundraising.  The North American Bitcoin Conference is set to take place on 19th-20th July, with notable speakers including Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz, Ripple Labs senior developer Stefan Thomas and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, among others.  Plan of attack  Throughout her dialogue, Boring took a hardline stance that suggested bitcoin needs – and deserves – advocacy in Washington due to the benefits the technology can provide to the entire world.  Still, Boring said that the US will be step one on the path toward bringing the technology to the global mass market. She remarked:  ""I believe that the legislation that comes out of Washington will be echoed around the world.""  Boring said that the group will seek to recruit industry members for two boards that will help craft ""smart regulation for the industry"" and target legislators, regulators and policy makers, ensuring they obtain accurate information about digital currencies and digital assets.  Curbing media concerns  Boring said that while she believes the industry is ""at risk"" due to poor regulation, bitcoin needs to do more than simply work with lawmakers in order to advance the technology.  For example, she indicated that the Chamber of Digital Commerce will seek to inform the media in order to ensure that they do their part to properly educate consumers.  Boring indicated that the organisation will provide a ""full suite of public affairs professionals"" that will be the first line of defense for this initiative.  Government lobbying grows  The announcement coincides with the recent increase in the number of bitcoin organisations seeking to lobby on behalf of bitcoin in Washington, DC.  In May, bitcoin investment fund Falcon Global Capital hired a team of lobbyists to work in the US capitol, and the industry's leading trade organisation, the Bitcoin Foundation, followed suit, announcing a similar move in July when it secured the services of Thorsen French Advocacy.  However, Boring suggested that the group is not part of the foundation, and that it will pursue its own initiatives.    ""We're not related to the Bitcoin Foundation,"" @PerianneDC says of her new lobbying group, the Chamber of Digital Commerce #bitcoinchicago      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) July 19, 2014      The news follows what is perhaps the biggest announcement to affect US regulation, the release of New York's proposed BitLicense guidelines for bitcoin businesses.

42397787,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAN6,1405770638,Under the Microscope: Conclusions on the Costs of Bitcoin,"Under the Microscope has aimed to cast a critical eye over the social, environmental and economic impacts of the way we currently transact and transfer wealth, be it through legacy systems like gold and fiat currencies, or through newer digital cryptographic ones.  The series has also endeavoured to give readers a clearer idea of the human and environmental impacts associated with both current and future monetary systems, and allow them to draw their own conclusions on the relative sustainability of the old and new systems when viewed from a holistic “triple-bottom-line” approach.  Although it is not necessarily fair to compare bitcoin to the entire legacy banking system, there was doubt in the community about the impact of the legacy banking system, and thus, it has been quantified for completeness.    As can be conclusively seen, the relative impact of the bitcoin network does not even register on the radar of the fiat and gold-based monetary systems, representing a very conservative relative environmental impact of just over 0.13%, and a relative economic impact of just under 0.04%. When one considers Koomey’s Law, we can expect energy/GH to continue to half every 18 months until 2048.  This means that we can expect our current industry best efficiency of 0.733 W/GH to reach 0.0000000873804 W/GH. Thus – armchair academics take note – in the event that bitcoin scales to a million times its current size and market cap over the next 30 years, it’s environmental impact will still be insignificant compared to existing systems.  When considering Moore’s Law, we can expect $/GH to continue to half every 18 months until at least 2020. When we consider the advent of decentralised emission-free renewable energy, we can expect tCO2/GH, and possibly even $/kWh, to tend towards zero.  The more agile and dynamic bitcoin companies can take advantage of these trends, but the sluggish, inert and over-encumbered incumbents simply cannot. As time goes on, bitcoin only becomes more sustainable, while legacy systems continue to bloat year-on-year.  There are no negative social externalities as a result of bitcoin proliferation, and any money laundering and shadow economy dealings that currently happen on the network will reduce drastically in proportion as adoption grows and regulations firm up on the on-and-off ramps into the bitcoin economy.  Rome wasn’t built in a day, and the crypto-currency space will take time to evolve to ensure that the issues faced and created by our legacy monetary systems do not continue to plague us for the next century and beyond.  It has been demonstrated that institutional fraud is a problem systemic to humans, and not to monetary systems. However, transactional fraud is only a problem in legacy systems due to the infallibility of the fact that 2 + 2 will always equal 4.  Although this paper has shied away from all of the ideological and philosophical debates surrounding bitcoin, what is clear is that the argument that bitcoin is superior monetary system – from the benefits and protections it provides to merchants and consumers, to the relative lack of negative impact it has on our planet and humanity in general – is a strong one.  The world is currently crippled by several issues, and the human race faces several existential threats such as climate change, the global ageing population demographic crisis and wealth and income inequality.  It is also unacceptable in 2014 to still have tens of millions of people forced into labour, and current monetary systems are somewhat responsible for several of the social ills brought about by corruption, money laundering and the black market.  For those who are willing to back their principles and morals with their money, bitcoin provides the opportunity for socially, environmentally and economically conscious global citizens to choose to no longer participate in the fragile and rotten legacy monetary system, and voluntarily participate in the open and wondrous bitcoin ecosystem.  Due to the several benefits and significantly reduced burden on our planet and society, there is a certain feeling of inevitability about digital currencies, whether it be bitcoin, or a future currency that proves to be even more sustainable and beneficial for humanity.

42397802,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAas,1405764030,10 Impressive Bitcoin-Inspired Art Pieces,"Who says bitcoiners are always hunched over their computer screens?  Sure, the digital currency lends itself to a loyal crowd of computer scientists and geeky tech-savvy enthusiasts, but over the past few months a new group has shown its proclivity for bitcoin: artists.  Even bitcoin's biggest skeptics would admit that despite all else, the digital currency sure is captivating.  While some bitcoiners spend their time closely following the news or monitoring their mining operations to get their crypto-fix, it seems like bitcoin has become a muse for a number of creatives who use fine art as a medium to express their fascination.  Whether it's through oil paintings, sculpture, or other mixed media, these 10 pieces of bitcoin artwork showcase the creativity of some of the bitcoin community's finest artists.  1. The Last (Bitcoin) Supper by Youl  Painted by French artist Youl, The Last (Bitcoin) Supper is intricate, balanced and colorful. With QR codes, laptops and some trendy outfits, this 140x70cm painting is a fittingly modern tribute to Da Vinci's similar namesake.  Fans of the painting also have their fair shot at purchasing this piece – it's currently up for auction on eBay for $1,075.00.  2. Bitcoin Mechanical Wallet 08 by Zoran Kutuzovic  This multi-paneled acrylic abstract painting depicts a wallet that exists in the virtual space. Zoran Kutuzovic, a Croatian multimedia artist, offers this 240x60cm creation as his contribution to the bitcoin community, available to purchase for $550.  3.Untitled Mining Installation by Peter Frölich  Peter Frölich doesn't normally like the idea of creating art solely for profit. However, after feeling inspired by Banksy and his love of bitcoin mining, Frölich decided to venture outside of his comfort zone.  The result is a fully operational mining rig (details on the hardware here) mounted in a baroque gold-plated frame: a beautiful, moneymaking creation.  4. Cryptsy-Cryptocurrencies Market by Stefania Nistoreanu  Romanian artist Stefania Nistoreanu has taken quite a liking to digital currencies. The idea for this oil and gold leaf painting was conceived after Nistoreanu made ""a lot of cryptocurrency transactions"" in her first two weeks using the Cryptsy exchange.  The 50x70cm painting is for sale for $4,320, or about 6.86 BTC at today's market price.  5. Silk Road Prison Art by /u/YesterdaysNews2  More than a few people have spoken out in support of alleged Silk Road leader Ross Ulbricht, who is currently incarcerated while his trial is underway.  Reddit user /u/YesterdaysNews2 expressed his feelings about Ulbricht's predicament in a creative, tongue-in-cheek way. The piece features the FBI's wallet address that formerly held the seized coins engraved on the wooden paneling as well as the Brooklyn prison where Ulbrict is being held.  /u/YesterdaysNews2 told fellow redditors that ""1 BTC and [a] shipping address"" is all he or she needs to deliver this artwork to prospective buyers.  6. Satoshi by Juan Miguel Delgado  This poignant portrayal of a bitcoin transaction depicts a homeless beggar accepting a donation from a purposely faceless man--presumably Satoshi Nakamoto.  According to the artist, a Costa Rican man named Juan Miguel Delgado, the beggar is supposedly a former banking executive. The QR code in the painting directs to a real wallet address that claims to be used to donate to the poor.  7. Satoshi Nakamoto by Michal Cander  Delgado isn't the only artist fascinated with Satoshi Nakamoto.  Polish artist Michal Cander was contracted by a private buyer to paint this 65x80cm oil on canvas piece, and Cander clearly played off of the bitcoin creator's Japanese pseudonym.  8. It's Like Gamblin? by Dan Gribben  American artist Dan Gribben debuted this painting at the 'The Time Is Now' bitcoin art show in San Francisco back in March.  Perhaps a commentary about bitcoin's price volatility, It's Like Gamblin? speaks to the risky nature of investing in bitcoin while staying true to the artist's cartoonish and colorful style.  9. The Art of Bitcoin by Pierre Bourque  Canadian artist Pierre Bourque has garnered a following in the bitcoin community for his distinct aesthetic, and this 100x100cm print is a fine example of why people enjoy his work.  The bitcoin emblem piece is available for $10,000 to a lucky (and wealthy) bitcoiner looking to add a Bourque to their collection.  10. Free Lunch by David Kim  Newsweek's cover story revealing Dorian Nakamoto as the alleged creator of bitcoin caused a media frenzy when it hit stands in March.  Artist David Kim was among those fascinated with the drama surrounding D. Nakamoto. This painting captures the hectic scene of Nakamoto wading his way through a sea of photographers on his way to clear his name in an exclusive interview with the Associated Press.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MINING | ZRX,Tom Sharkey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/19/10-impressive-bitcoin-inspired-art-pieces,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df5af97f843d12b55bc4049850d8b8ceb1599a35-1260x811.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397797,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAWw,1405741210,"All Things Alt: The MintPal Fallout, Viacoin's Big Haul and an Altcoin for Kids","With the summer (or winter, depending on where you are) nearly half over, there’s been seemingly no end to the exciting times in the world of alt.  Events both positive and negative have shaped the space in the past two weeks, but as always, there’s simply not enough time to sum it all up. From new service launches to catastrophic conclusions to altcoin projects, the ups and downs of the altcoin ecosystem still show no sign of abating as we head into the final days of July.  Developers debate vericoin block chain rollback  Last week’s successful attack on digital currency exchange MintPal drew both support and condemnation for the decision by the vericoin development team to roll back the blockchain and reverse the theft of roughly 8 million VRC.  Many observers took to social media to comment on the developments. On 15th July, litecoin founder Charlie Lee posted a statement on the official litecoin subreddit. He said that he believed the vericoin rollback was a mistake, and one that the litecoin team would not repeat should a similar large-scale theft occur.  He remarked that developers should have “no right” to intervene, saying:  “The rules are set forth since the genesis block and cannot be changed. If a theft happens on top of the network, the developers will not fork the coin to reverse any transactions. It is up to the market to decide on how to handle the theft.”  However, he acknowledged that the vericoin team was put into “a bad position” and, owing to the nature of proof-of-stake mining, faced the alternative of a fraudulent actor in control of roughly 30 percent of the vericoin network.  Vericoin developer Patrick Nosker replied to the litecoin subreddit thread that Lee’s comments were “well said”. However, he said that “to not fork would guarantee the death of vericoin”, and that the situation, in the broader history of cryptocurrencies, was unprecedented  He explained:  “When someone is faced with a critical question like this with very little decision-making time it is very difficult to make a wise decision. We quickly analyzed the blockchain and determined that if the coin count was above 6 million coins it was able to attack the coin by mechanism of a 51% attack. That left us with only two options: Fork (like we did) or to blacklist the new addresses in a wallet update and hope people upgraded before the thief sent the coins to new addresses.”  The two developers continued to discuss the nature of the attack, agreeing that the situation was fast-paced and uncertain, but Lee said that the “implications” of the event may not yet be fully understood. Notably, Nosker said that the developers had no stake in the large amount of stolen coins, confirming earlier statements that the move was designed principally to protect investors keeping funds on MintPal.  Viacoin presale raises 610 BTC  A new altcoin project attracted more than 600 BTC in a pre-sale prior to the launch of the block chain.  The eight-day presale of viacoin brought in just over 610 BTC, an amount worth more than $380,000. The round consisted of both large and small investors, as shown by a presale distribution list provided on the alt’s official Bitcoin Talk forum post. Notably, the document shows that one investor purchased 75 BTC worth of the alt.  Viacoin is being developed in conjunction with another initiative called ClearingHouse, a decentralized protocol that will be built using Counterparty as a basis for development. Developer BTCDrak said on the official viacoin blog that services for viacoin will be the focus until ClearingHouse is released, which will also include its own internal currency.  BTCDrak told CoinDesk that he was surprised by the outcome, saying that he hoped to generate about 150 BTC during the presale. However, he cited enthusiasm from multiple sectors of the crypto community – as well as the body of investors who work in altcoins – as key to the successful presale.  He added:  “It's pretty surreal.”  Poloniex launches market for NXT-backed asset  Digital assets denominated in altcoins aren’t exactly a new idea. But in what may be an industry first, an established, centralized exchange is launching a new tradeable asset connected to a variety of NXT-based projects and initiatives.  The JLH (short for jl777hodl) asset, now available on Poloniex, consists of 20 different assets that are available on that project’s decentralized exchange. According to Poloniex, these assets include shares in payment processors, mining groups and other parts of the crypto ecosystem being built around NXT, as well as stakes in real estate or other tangible points of investment.  Poloniex owner Tristan D'Agosta explained that, in part, the launch is a step toward centralized exchanges in the altcoin space offering more than just coin pairs.  He told CoinDesk:  “Alts are tied to currencies, and the vast majority aim to be currencies. Assets can be anything: shares of real estate, gold, shares in a company, etc. Listing managed assets on Poloniex brings greater visibility to cryptocurrency; it sets the precedent that centralized exchanges are now empowered to offer investing beyond speculation of widespread adoption and now tie value to performance.”  Since launching on 18th July, the feature attracted immediate if not modest volume, and at press time, the 24-hour volume for BTC/JLH was just over 3 BTC.  Strange alt of the week  A new coin is hoping to capture the imagination behind the Tooth Fairy by creating a strange yet potentially effective means of distributing digital currencies.  Toothyfairycoin (sign: TFC), is a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid that uses the X15 hashing algorithm. The flagship service is to be specialized paper wallets that parents can presumably deposit underneath their children’s pillows. Instead of using paper money or coins, kids who lose their teeth can receive an altcoin instead.  For this unusual distribution method, toothfairycoin has won this week’s Strange Alt of the Week award.  The team behind TFC, which according to Bitcoin Talk has not yet launched, announced that it would hold a paper wallet design contest, with a winner’s purse of 250,000 toothfairycoins. But at it’s heart, the coin seems to be about injecting a bit of fun and imagination into the altcoin world.  As the developer wrote:  “Do you remember when you lost a tooth as a child? It was like Christmas when you woke up and found money underneath the pillow. It is for this reason that we have decided to release toothfairycoin.”  Images via Bitcoin Talk  Debate image via Shutterstock    Have a tip about a notable happening in the altcoin world?
