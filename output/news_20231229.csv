42391716,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfuaMx,1703893197,"Amid Bitcoin ETF Race, Wall Street Giants Dot Their Bureaucratic I's as Likely SEC Action Looms","The race to launch a bitcoin ETF reached a bureaucratic crescendo Friday as some of the biggest Wall Street firms finalized their offerings' paperwork ahead of widely expected – possibly imminent – approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco, as well as crypto-focused firms Valkyrie and Bitwise, revealed key details, including partnerships with vital trading firms and the fees their prospective ETFs will charge customers if the SEC gives the green light.  The fun could start in a matter of days. ETF watchers expect the SEC to drop its years-long stonewalling of a spot bitcoin ETF in early 2024. Over a dozen firms are hoping to break into the new market by selling their own version of the easily investable product to investors who'd rather keep their bitcoin exposure in their conventional brokerage accounts alongside stocks and bonds.  Friday's filing rush suggests the firms aren't willing to take any chances on timing. Bloomberg analysts have said the SEC is likely to approve multiple issuers at once to avoid picking favorites. Thus, the eager issuers are getting all the ducks in a row so that they can be in the first group.  BlackRock set off the end-of-week filing frenzy by declaring JPMorgan and Jane Street its authorized participants – a key role in the ETF business, a job that involves ensuring ETF prices stay closely linked to the value of their underlying assets. Within hours, other filings followed.

Invesco and its partner Galaxy Digital disclosed they'll waive fees for the first six months and $5 billion invested, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. That undercut Fidelity, which plans to charge 39 basis points.  But size also matters. Bitwise revealed it's already lined up $200 million in seed capital for its ETF, edging out BlackRock, which has $10 million at the ready. Investors could also choose one fund over the next simply because of its popularity out of the gate.

""I've always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etc.,"" he said during a U.S. Senate hearing this month. ""The only true use case for it is criminals,"" he added. ""If I was the government, I'd close it down.""  But this reprimand and the ones that preceded it – he called bitcoin a ""hyped-up fraud"" in January – are now very much a ""do as I say, not as I do"" situation. That's because JPMorgan is going deeper into the original cryptocurrency. On Friday, it was revealed that the bank will play a key role for BlackRock's proposed bitcoin [BTC] ETF.  JPMorgan will be one of its authorized participants if the ETF is approved, which involves ""ensuring that ETF prices are accurate, and that trading is smooth, in all market conditions,"" according to BlackRock. In the multi-trillion-dollar ETF industry, few jobs are more important than the one JPMorgan will play for BlackRock's product.  Given Dimon's stance, if this isn't hypocrisy, it's close.  In the world of finance, the allure of profits has always had the ability to override morals, though Wall Street has embraced the ESG movement (short for environmental, social and governance) in recent years, giving clients the ability to steer investments away from investments deemed not socially responsible.

21884623,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567390,1703887250,Record Crypto Options Volume Expires Pre-Bitcoin ETF Deadline: Analyzing BTC And ETH Reactions,"The recovery of the overall crypto market this year has spurred a surge in the digital-asset derivatives market as institutional investors seek exposure to the crypto space. According to a recent Bloomberg report, the deadline for US regulators to approve or reject Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has prompted traditional investors to turn to crypto options and futures, leading to unprecedented trading volumes. Crypto Options Trading Hits Record High Before the options expiry on Friday morning, crypto options trading volume reached a new all-time high, with options worth a notional value of $11 billion, as highlighted by Bloomberg. Of this total, Bitcoin contracts accounted for $7.7 billion, while Ethereum (ETH) options represented $3.5 billion. Related Reading: Here’s The Reason The Solana price Fell 8% To $98 Despite the expiration of many options, the impact on the major cryptocurrencies has been limited. With its strong support floor at $42,000, Bitcoin has maintained its position for a potential uptrend once bullish momentum returns and buying pressure increases. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has traded within the same range as the previous day, at $42,200, experiencing only a 0.4% decline. Nevertheless, Bitcoin has yet to fully recover from its 3.4% drop over the past seven days. In contrast, ETH was hit by the expiration of options contracts. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market, fell more than 2%. EHT dropped to $2,316 after hitting an annual high of $2,445 on Thursday. However, while heightened trading activity may accompany the expiration of options, it is unlikely to impact spot market prices, according to Luuk Strijers significantly, Deribit’s chief commercial officer. Strijers notes that clients are rolling their positions to 2024 expiries, and additional activity is anticipated after the expiry. The focus of attention and trading activity will primarily be on the impending ETF decision, Bloomberg notes. Surge From Traditional Asset Managers The cryptocurrency market has undergone a strong rally this year, with Bitcoin surging nearly 160% following a turbulent 2022 marked by industry scandals and price declines. The recovery has been fueled partly by the optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which would attract a broader range of investors to the asset class. Ryan Kim, head of derivatives at digital-asset prime brokerage FalconX, highlights the growing participation from crossover macro accounts, referring to large traditional asset managers allocating a small percentage of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies and crypto-focused hedge funds. In addition, according to Bloomberg, perpetual futures, a favored tool for leveraging crypto trades, are trading at a significant premium compared to spot prices, indicating rising demand for such products. Related Reading: ARK Invest Pivots To Bitcoin As Cathie Wood Expects BTC Price To Explode Overall, the surge in the cryptocurrency derivatives market, driven by options expiry and the pending decision on Bitcoin ETFs, reflects the growing interest of institutional investors in the crypto space. The record-breaking trading volumes and increased participation from traditional asset managers highlight the evolving landscape of digital assets. As the market awaits the regulatory verdict on Bitcoin ETFs, it remains to be seen how these developments will shape the future trajectory of the crypto market and its integration with traditional financial systems.

This move could further boost the popularity of Avalanche, a low-fee and high-throughput blockchain, and even support its native coin, AVAX. Avalanche Foundation To Support Meme Coins Taking to X on December 29, the foundation said it would continue its Culture Catalyst initiative to encourage meme coin activity, among others, including Real-World Assets (RWAs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. This campaign, they continue, aims to foster innovation and propel the adoption of blockchains by supporting the creation of “new forms of creativity, culture, and lifestyle.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Erases Recovery As Miners Cash Out 3,000 BTC The Avalanche Foundation believes that meme coins have carved out a significant niche in crypto, representing the collective spirit and shared interests of diverse crypto communities. By recognizing and encouraging this culture, the foundation hopes to develop and expand the Avalanche ecosystem, attracting new users. As they resume Culture Catalyst, the foundation will start by purchasing select Avalanche-based meme coins to create a collection. The selection process will be based on several critical criteria, including the number of holders, liquidity thresholds, project maturity, principles of a fair launch, and overall social sentiment. This move is a significant step for the Avalanche Foundation, as it indicates a growing recognition of the potential of meme coins to drive innovation and growth. It is because meme coins have become increasingly popular in recent years, often attracting large communities and generating significant trading volume. According to CoinMarketCap data on December 29, meme coins have a cumulative market cap of over $23 billion. Will AVAX And COQ Extend Gains In 2024? The foundation’s support for meme coins could further boost the popularity of Avalanche, as it will bring more attention to AVAX, a coin used for paying network fees. Thus far, AVAX remains in an uptrend, adding nearly 400% from October 2023 lows. Though there has been a cool-off, buyers have the upper hand. With rising demand triggered by more meme coins deploying on Avalanche, AVAX prices will likely float even higher. One of the Avalanche-based meme coins, COQ, is among the top 10 most liquid. According to DEX Tools data, there are over 34,000 COQ holders when writing. As of December 29, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest and most valuable meme coin, with over $13.2 billion in market cap. However, the launch and subsequent stellar performance of COQ propelled it to command a market cap of $114 million.

Bitcoin Rainbow Chart BTC Analysis Throughout the year, the price of Bitcoin has experienced several uptrends and downsides. Starting from the last three months of 2023, BTC’S price has experienced a major surge, hitting above $35,000 in October and surging past $44,000 in December. Related Reading: Here’s The Reason The Solana Price Fell 8% To $98 With the market moving up rapidly, many crypto investors and market watchers look for various crypto analytics tools to enhance their understanding of the Bitcoin market trends. The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is one of the many analytics tools available for predicting the potential prices of BTC. This color-coded chart is a long-term valuation tool for BTC that uses a logarithmic growth curve to forecast the potential price of BTC. Source: Blockchain Center Currently, according to the rainbow chart, Bitcoin is positioned around the “Accumulate” and “Still cheap” zones. This implies that the chart is showing the best timeline to purchase BTC before the selling phase begins. The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart simplifies BTC price predictions, helping investors identify potential BTC buying and selling opportunities. However, it’s important to note that the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is not investment advice and does not predict the exact price of Bitcoin. BTC price readies to retest $43,000 | Source: BTCUSD On Tradingview.com History Of The BTC Rainbow Chart The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart first started as a fun project created by a Reddit user, Azop to visually represent Bitcoin’s price history. However, the chart became more mainstream after a second version was developed by trader Trololo and transformed into a crypto technical analysis tool. The chart is designed using a color coding scheme and highlights each Bitcoin halving cycle and diverse BTC price ranges. With its seven color bands, the rainbow chart identifies strategic points to buy, sell, or hold BTC. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge: ‘Dumb Money’ Will Miss Out, Analyst Cautions The dark red band signals a maximum bubble territory, the red band indicates a robust selling phase, while orange and yellow signify FOMO intensification and HODL periods respectively. The Green band indicates a favorable buying and accumulation window and lastly, the blue color band represents a fire sale opportunity. While the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart does not provide financial advice, it is a widely recognized tool used by crypto traders and investors to gain a simpler understanding of BTC market movements. Ultimately, the accuracy of the chart’s predictions depends on how it is applied and in what context.

Recent data indicates a significant uptick in user engagement, marked by a substantial increase in both transactions and wallet growth. The Shibariumscan explorer reveals that daily transaction volume on Shibarium has reached roughly 7.84 million, reflecting a steady climb since the beginning of the month. This uptrend in activity has propelled the total transactions on the platform to 212 million, accompanied by the connection of over 1.3 million Shibarium wallets, signifying a growing network of users. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Moves $45 Million In SHIB, Bullish? Shibarium’s Dynamic December: Wallet Growth Meets Fluctuating User Activity Despite the notable growth in wallets, there has been a contrasting trend in active user numbers. While the account numbers have swelled in December, active user engagement experienced a downturn during the same period. However, a slight rebound in active users was observed on December 27, hinting at a potential revival in participation. Particularly, Shibarium’s active users surged from a low of 1,878 as of December 23 to an high of 2,802 on the 27th. This pattern of fluctuating user activity, juxtaposed with the consistent increase in wallet numbers, paints a complex picture of Shibarium’s current ecosystem dynamics. Alongside Shibarium’s transactional growth, the Shiba Inu community has intensified its efforts in token incineration, aiming to reduce the circulating supply of SHIB tokens and potentially boost their value. The burn tracker Shibburn reports a 17.59% increase in the daily burn rate, with 13.7 million SHIB tokens recently burned. So far, December has witnessed the burning of roughly 24 billion Shiba Inu tokens, underscoring the community’s commitment to reducing SHIB’s supply. This consistent burning strategy is central to the community’s long-term goal of fostering token value growth through supply reduction. Shiba Inu Market Resilience Amid Security Warnings Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has thrived to continue its month-long bullishness. Despite a 1% decline in the past week, the asset currently shows an upward trajectory increasing by 0.8% in the past 24 hours, with a market price of $0.00001047, at the time of writing. In the midst of these developments, the ShibArmy Scam Alerts account on X has raised concerns about the prevalent issue of security in the crypto domain, particularly focusing on Shibarium.

BTC Price Boom Predicted Following ETF Acceptance Founder and CEO of American asset investment management firm, ARK Invest, Catherine Duddy Wood has recently appeared in an interview with Yahoo Finance.

Related Reading: Top Banker Reveals Why XRP Price Will Rise 390,000% To $2,500 According to the ARK Invest CEO, the price of BTC could surge substantially if the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves Spot Bitcoin ETFs for institutional investors. “What we think is going to happen here is that the SEC is going to be giving BTC, a spot bitcoin ETF, the green light for institutional investors to participate. I think a lot of institutions have been reticent before the SEC approves a spot bitcoin ETF to do very much at all in the crypto asset world,” Wood stated. She added: “All we need is for the trillions of dollars in institutional assets out there to allocate maybe 0.1% or 0.2% to an ETF, which will be one of the easiest ways to gain exposure and one of the most efficient ways to gain exposure to BTC. That will move the price significantly.” BTC price fails to beat resistance at $43,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin ETF Approval Expected In January During the interview, Wood outlined a timeline for the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, predicting the potential approval dates for January. “We do think it will be in January.

42391719,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfuaCh,1703864950,India's Local Crypto and Web3 Advocacy Body Asked for Action Against Offshore Entities: Source,"The offshore exchanges have been given two weeks to respond to the show cause notice.  ""All we are asking for is a level playing field,"" said Rajagopal Menon, Vice President of prominent Indian crypto exchange WazirX.  The Indian government's decision to block URLs of nine offshore exchanges and issue them show cause notices on Thursday came after an official request asking for the same from the Indian crypto and Web3 association's advocacy body, a letter viewed by CoinDesk shows.  The letter dated Dec. 16 was written by the Bharat Web3 Association's (BWA) Chairman, Dilip Chenoy, and was addressed to the Indian Finance Ministry's Department of Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra.  The offshore exchanges have been given two weeks to respond to the show cause notice, which asks why actions against them shouldn't be taken, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity given the person wasn't authorized to speak on the matter. However, the letter from the BWA sought a one-month grace period for offshore exchanges to register with India's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which falls under the Finance Ministry.  It wasn't immediately clear whether the BWA letter was single-handedly responsible for the action or whether the government would have taken the action unilaterally as well.  In March, India’s Finance Ministry mandated that crypto businesses will have to register with the FIU, the country's anti-money laundering unit, and comply with other processes under its Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). As many as 31 domestic entities have registered themselves with the FIU since.  Binance, KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global and Bitfinex are the nine exchanges. None of the entities responded to CoinDesk's requests for comment during the end-of-the-year holiday season.  The BWA didn't immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  The action by local crypto-related entities against foreign exchanges is rare if not entirely unprecedented in so far as local exchanges haven't asked the government to take action against offshore exchanges. The move comes after Indian crypto exchanges have been in survival mode, trying to extend their runways, ever since the nation imposed stifling taxes on the industry – a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions.  A think tank has detailed how the TDS prompted as many as 5 million Indian crypto traders to move their transactions offshore and estimated that it cost the government a potential $420 million in revenue since it was introduced in July 2022. The study also revealed that Indians moved more than $3.8 billion in trading volume from local to international crypto exchanges after the controversial crypto rules were announced.  The letter from the BWA also asked for the government to ask the offshore exchanges to establish an Indian subsidiary or entity, to mandate depositing of the applicable TDS effective from when it was imposed on July 1, 2022, and in case of non-compliance, restrict access to these platforms on mobile app stores and block their IP addresses.  It isn't clear whether all of these requests from the BWA feature in the show cause notices.  Crucially, the letter asked the government to give Indian retailers 30 days to withdraw their assets before implementing any restrictions.  ""All we are asking for is a level playing field,"" said Rajagopal Menon, Vice President of prominent Indian crypto exchange WazirX which has also been embattled in a dispute with Binance over ownership. ""We are focusing on the 1% TDS issue because that is what is affecting our business.""  Sumit Gupta, the co-founder and CEO of CoinDCX, another leading crypto exchange said Indian exchanges, led by BWA, have consistently advocated for a level playing field, particularly in the context of investors migrating to offshore platforms, which are not obligated to implement taxation and 1% TDS.  ""FIU IND's recent steps toward offshore Virtual Digital Assets Service Providers (VDA SPs) will mitigate risks, protecting users and investors from potential scams and fostering the development of a secure VDA ecosystem,"" Gupta said.

Bitcoin Miner Reserve Has Taken A Plunge Recently As pointed out by analyst Ali in a new post on X, the BTC miners have participated in some selling recently. The indicator of interest here is the “miner reserve,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin sitting in the wallets of all miners. When the value of this metric goes up, it means that the miners are receiving a net number of coins in their addresses right now. Such a trend suggests that these chain validators are choosing to accumulate the asset currently, which can naturally have bullish effects on the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Bought The Recent Dip While Market Panicked On the other hand, a decline implies that this cohort is transferring coins out of their wallets at the moment. Generally, the miners make such outflows when they are looking to sell their BTC, so this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner reserve over the past month: The value of the metric seems to have sharply dropped in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin miner reserve has registered a sharp drop during the past couple of days. During this withdrawal spree, these chain validators transferred out more than 3,000 BTC from their wallets, worth around $128 million at the current exchange rate. Bitcoin had recovered to the $43,800 level earlier after news had come out about Microstrategy completing another substantial purchase. As the miners made these outflows, though, the cryptocurrency witnessed a drawdown towards the $42,000 mark. Given the timing, it would appear possible that the miners had made these transfers to cash in on the recovery and this extra selling pressure may have contributed to the decline that the asset ended up seeing. Miners are a group that has to pay constant operating costs in the form of electricity bills, so they regularly sell some of the BTC they mine and earn from transaction fees in order to cover these expenses. More often not, though, the miners only participate in relatively low levels of selling, which is readily absorbed by the market and the cryptocurrency doesn’t feel too much impact This time around, though, these chain validators have sold a sizeable amount inside a narrow window, which is potentially why Bitcoin has appeared to have been affected. In some other news, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has revealed the average holding time on the Bitcoin blockchain and how it compares against other networks. The average holding time across three networks | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As is visible above, Bitcoin holders carry their coins for 4.3 years on average, which is far greater than what Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) blockchains observe. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Bull Run Begin? This Could Be The Metric To Watch While miners don’t tend to HODL because of their running costs, it would appear that the normal investors on the BTC network are more than making up for it by holding for very extended periods.

Miner reserves measure the number of coins held by the affiliated miners' wallets. The number drops as the coins are moved to crypto exchanges, possibly as a prelude to a sale.  Miners began balancing their books in late October, with reserves entering a decline that accelerated this month. Reserves now number 1.832 million BTC being held by miners, down from October's high of 1.845 million.  In a post on social-media platform X, AliCharts pointed out that miners have sold 3,000 bitcoin [BTC] over the past 24 hours, equating to around $129 million. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $42,891, down from yesterday's high of $43,710.  The net flow of bitcoin on Dec. 28 stood at minus 1,524 BTC, meaning that withdrawals exceeded new coins being minted, data shows.  Bitcoin will undergo a halving in April, which will see miner rewards slashed to 3.125 BTC per block from 6.25 BTC. Analysts predict that the halving will cause a supply shock with bitcoin potentially reaching $160,000.

It typically is applied to any freely traded market where larger or institutional traders operate (commodities, bonds, currencies, etc.). In this article we will apply WA to the cryptocurrency Storj ($STORJ) to make a forecast for approximate future events. Storj Price Data from MEXC Futures | Source: STORJUSDT.P on tradingview.com. Link to the raw image: https://www.tradingview.com/x/BGsOkzGM Storj is currently in Phase E of a Wyckoff Distribution Schematic #1. StockCharts says this about Phase E in their article on the Wyckoff Method: Phase E depicts the unfolding of the downtrend; the stock leaves the TR and supply is in control. Once TR support is broken on a major SOW, this breakdown is often tested with a rally that fails at or near support. This also represents a high-probability opportunity to sell short. Subsequent rallies during the markdown are usually feeble. Traders who have taken short positions can trail their stops as price declines. After a significant down-move, climactic action may signal the beginning of a re-distribution TR or of accumulation. The trading range for Storj was $1 – $1.12 and it has concretely fallen below that. From the picture below a major SOW has occurred, more so pointing to a Distribution occurring. This also coincides with our analyst’s Elliott Wave (EWT) view on Storj. They predict a small rally as Storj continues to fall in its Wave 2. The majority of the liquidity (per its relevant Volume Profile) is between the 38.2% and 61.8% LFR at $0.56 and $0.76 respectively. A liquidity cluster is typically expected between these LFRs in EWT leading us to the think a Wave 2 correction is happening. Additionally, the cluster is in the price range of the subwave 4, an EWT guideline. Storj Price Data from MEXC Futures | Source: STORJUSDT.P on tradingview.com.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin ticked back toward the $43,000 mark during European morning trading hours having slipped down to $42,173.76 during the Asian session. At the time of writing BTC is trading at $42,884, down just 0.45% in the last 24 hours. On the last working day of 2023, bitcoin looks set to close the year up around 158% against its price of around $16,500 12 months ago. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the weighted performance of the digital-asset market, gained 139% in 2023.  Privacy tokens dash, monero and ZCash slumped as much as 10% after crypto exchange OKX said it will delist their trading pairs on Jan. 5. The exchange is making the move ""based on feedback from users and the OKX Token Delisting/Hiding Guideline,"" OKX wrote on its website. While OKX did not explicitly say it was banning the tokens because they offer enhanced privacy for transactions, many of those listed fall into that category. Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that preserve anonymity by obscuring the flow of money across their networks. They make it difficult to work out who sent what to whom, which is useful for those who do not want their financial activity to be monitored and, not surprisingly, are unpopular with regulators.  The Avalanche Foundation, which supports the Avalanche blockchain ecosystem, said it is considering buying meme coins as part of a drive that recognizes the distinct niches of the cryptocurrency market. Avalanche-based meme coins like COQ, husky and shibx have gained as much as 25% in the last 24 hours, with most of those gains coming after the foundation's announcement. The selection process will be based on criteria such as the number of holders, liquidity thresholds, project maturity and overall social sentiment, the foundation said in a post on X. “These coins, often inspired by internet culture and humor, go beyond mere utility assets; they represent the collective spirit and shared interests of diverse crypto communities,” the post read.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against a basket of fiat currencies, including the euro, has declined by 4.7% in the fourth quarter.  The weakness in the DXY likely helped bitcoin and other risk assets perform positively in the three months.  BTC has risen by nearly 60% this quarter.

With a price surge of more than 70% as of this writing, the cryptocurrency hit $84.8, a level not seen since April 2022. The spike may be attributed to the prevailing optimistic market sentiment, however there are other factors at play for Bitcoin SV. Related Reading: MATIC Blasts Off: 20% Surge As Polygon Trading Volume Hits Records BSV’s Surge: South Korea Dominates With this latest surge, BSV’s monthly gains have surpassed 82%, and its trading volume has risen noticeably to over $770 million. This rise appears to be influenced by the persistently optimistic market sentiment in the larger cryptocurrency market, with South Korean investors especially playing a significant role. BSV price at $88.43. Source: Coingecko Upbit, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, was responsible for $515 million worth of BSV trades in the last day, according to CoinGecko data. With more than 67% of the transaction volume, it commands a huge proportion. This suggests that South Korean investors are interested in BSV. At the time of writing, Bithumb, another well-known cryptocurrency trading platform in Asia, accounted for about 5% of all trades in the asset. By itself, South Korean cryptocurrency traders accounted for more than 75% of BSV’s entire trading volume on the previous day. BSV market cap currently at $1.714 billion. Chart: TradingView.com In 2018, Craig Wright initiated the creation of BSV by implementing a hard fork of BCH, which itself had undergone a hard fork from the original BTC chain in August 2017. Nevertheless, the asset has sparked significant debate as its originator asserts to be the true Satoshi Nakamoto, yet fails to provide definitive proof. BSV Surges 80% Amidst ETF Anticipation The market’s widespread excitement around the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US is one factor contributing to the rising value of BSV. As a result, throughout the last 30 days, the value of the Bitcoin fork has increased by nearly 80%. BSV price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko To stop illicit activity in the space, South Korea recently made the decision to create a framework for crypto regulations. Furthermore, a December 27 update disclosed that the nation has mandated public officials to disclose their cryptocurrency holdings, marking a noteworthy advancement in the regulation of the space. Given the sense of security that comes with operating in a regulated industry, investors may have taken notice of these developments.

Often referred to as “Satoshi’s Vision” for Bitcoin, BSV experienced a little decline in its market value following a Coinbase statement.

21871086,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567348,1703849454,Here’s The Reason The Solana price Fell 8% To $98,"The Solana price growth for the past few months seems to have hit a barrier just above the $120 price level. The price of Solana (SOL) fell around 8% on Thursday to about $98, showing the sheer volatile nature of the crypto market. As a result, Solana slipped below BNB in market cap rankings, as the latter rallied 9% to take back the fourth spot. According to on-chain data, there’s been an increase in transfers of what looks like profit-taking from Solana whales. Large Whale Sells $38.2 Million in SOL Tokens When whales move a lot of crypto, they can really shake things up. According to Lookonchain, an anonymous investor deposited 303,756 SOL tokens worth approximately $38.2 million on Binance, possibly as part of a selloff. Further details show this particular whale has made strategic SOL trades in the past, making huge profits. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge: ‘Dumb Money’ Will Miss Out, Analyst Cautions The whale withdrew 19,704 SOL from Binance on Sept 29. Solana was trading at $20 during this time, making the transfer worth approximately $394,000. The whale would then deposit it into Binance at $43 per token on Nov 8, making $453,000, a 115% profit. Data from Lookonchain shows that the address still has 119,998 SOL tokens worth $12.44 million staked, and is sitting on over $17 million unrealized profit. A whale deposited 303,756 $SOL($32.8M) to #Binance today, possibly selling it for profit. The whale withdrew 423,754 $SOL($28.18M) at $66.5 from #Binance in the past 1 month.

This whale also withdrew… pic.twitter.com/Sptfj7uUIa — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 28, 2023 Speculation that other large holders of SOL, known as “whales,” sold off portions of their holdings recently may have contributed to the recent price dip. Similar social media posts from whale transaction tracker whale alerts have shown various large SOL transfers from private wallets into crypto exchanges on Thursday, suggesting whales locking in profits or reducing their exposure to the token. Two of the most notable transactions were the transfer of 1,832,958 SOL worth $182.9 million from an unknown wallet to Coinbase and the transfer of 114,046 SOL worth $11.5 million from another private wallet to Coinbase. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 1,832,958 #SOL (182,951,373 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/7h1GmobutZ — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 28, 2023 🚨 114,046 #SOL (11,536,447 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/5giZek1q0Z — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 28, 2023 Trading data also suggests traders were moving funds out of SOL to stablecoins. As a result, Solana’s price cascaded and fell from $110 to $98 in 24 hours. SOL price recovers to $107 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com Current State Of Solana The SOL community and ecosystem have witnessed one of the best price growth this year. Over the past 24 hours, around $18.6 million worth of Solana positions were liquidated, with $10.42 million coming from leveraged long positions, data from CoinGlass shows. This profit-taking sentiment seems to have rolled over into BONK, Solana’s first dog-themed meme token, which is now 50% down from its all-time high.

Heading into 2024, I prefer the baby bonds and their 18+% yield over the company's equity. A probable equity raise in the next six months is likely to cause the baby bonds to do very well in 2024. Introduction Headquartered in England, Argo Blockchain plc ( ARBK ) ("" Argo "") is a middling player in the global cryptocurrency mining industry. With the recent rise in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ("" Bitcoin ""), however, the stock price is up roughly 200% year to date. While I have little interest in the stock, I find Argo's 8.75% Senior Notes due 2026 ( ARBKL ) (the "" Bonds ""), which are up more than 250% year to date, interesting and have owned them for more than a year now, adding to my position in the Bonds most recently on November 9, 2023 (at $6.53). Since then, the Bonds have skyrocketed to nearly $12 ($11.84 at the time of writing). In this article, I discuss the investment case for the Bonds. At the very end, I also provide an update on my overall positioning heading into 2024. Basics Concerning the Bonds Each of the Bonds is a par $25 bond with an 8.75% coupon maturing on 11/30/2026. The Bonds are unsecured . Interest payments of .5468 cents are paid on a quarterly basis. Trading at less than 50 cents on the dollar, the Bonds now yield more than 18%. The Bonds will next pay a dividend on January 31, 2024 to holders of record on January 15, 2024. If the price of Bitcoin remains above $40,000 and history is any guide, I would expect the price of the Bonds to increase by a couple of percentage points as the interest payment record date approaches. The Bonds mature on November 30, 2026. The Bonds may be called by Argo starting on November 30, 2025. A Speculative Investment To be clear, I do not think Argo is a great mining company and the price of the Bonds reflects this. Unaudited Balance Sheet Q3 Earnings Presentation As can been seen from the above balance sheet from Argo's third quarter earnings presentation, (1) total current liabilities of $27.3 million materially exceed current assets of $16.2 million, (2) total liabilities of $86.9 million slightly exceed total assets of $84 million, and (3) as a consequence of the foregoing, shareholder equity is nearly negative $3 million. Indeed, not anything to boast about and, frankly, a lot to be concerned about. Argo, which trades in London (in addition to trading on the Nasdaq), was able to raise equity earlier in the year at prices much lower than today's stock price (under $1.75 versus a stock price of above $4 today) On the Q3 Earnings Call , the then Interim CEO, noted: In July, we strengthened our balance sheet by raising $7.5 million in gross proceeds through an equity raise with primarily institutional investors in the U.K. and also reduced our Galaxy debt by $5 million. And at the end of September, our cash balance was $8 million."" In addition to that cash, the latest operational update reports that Argo holds 21 Bitcoin (worth approximately $900,000 assuming a price per Bitcoin of $43,000). The cash position is augmented by power credits (more than $2.5 million worth) that Argo has been generating at its Texas mining facility. The credits do not change the fact that overall liquidity and asset coverage are weak. While the Company has reduced its debt considerably over the last 18 months ( see debt summary graphic below ) a lot more can and should be done. With the Bonds selling below 50 cents on the dollar, Argo should be raising as much equity as it can to pay off the senior secured debt (owed primarily to Galaxy Digital Holdings, a company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange) (the "" Galaxy Secured Debt ""). With the huge rise in Argo's stock price, I would like to think the company could raise at least double the $8 million of proceeds it raised earlier in 2023. If it did, I would expect the Bonds to rise to at least $15 dollars. Given the precarious position of its balance sheet, the Board of Directors of Argo has to be thinking about raising equity at every meeting and even in between meetings (and if the Board is not doing so, it would be grossly negligent). Any such equity raise will be a catalyst for another big increase in the price of the Bonds. Moreover, if the Galaxy Secured Debt can ever be paid off, Argo could then start buying back the Bonds at a discount. Of course, I am getting ahead of myself, but as long as Bitcoin can stay near or above $40,000, Argo should have the time and flexibility to engage in some positive financial engineering via equity raises. While management might not want to dilute the equity holders, absent Bitcoin doubling from here, I believe it has no choice. Moreover, the dramatic rise in its stock provides the cover to do so, as it can point to the last equity raise being a success (and, indeed it was). DEBT SUMMARY FROM Q3 2023 PRESENTATION Q3 Earnings Presentation Operations Are (Slowly) Improving Per the November update (linked above): During the month of November, the Company mined 145 Bitcoin or Bitcoin Equivalents (together, ""BTC""), or 4.8 BTC per day. The Company was able to increase its daily BTC production in November by 5% compared to the prior month, despite a 9% increase in the monthly average network difficulty in November compared to October. Mining revenue in November 2023 amounted to $5.30 million, an increase of 25% compared to the prior month (October 2023: $4.26 million). The increase in revenue was driven primarily by the increase in the price of Bitcoin."" While other operating metrics are also improving, the Company has to show that it can stabilize its liquidity situation and balance sheet. Year-end results will be important in this regard as shareholders and bondholders will get a chance to see the effects of (1) improved operating performance, (2) reduced debt and reduced interest expense, and (3) an increased Bitcoin price. In short, Q4 2023 is a show-me quarter for Argo. Whether the Company performs well or not, it needs to raise equity. This task will be a lot easier if Argo outperforms in Q4 2023. Given the latest operational update, the probabilities have increased that Argo does just that. Risks Some of the risk to Argo's business include: 1) Liquidity and asset coverage weaknesses , as described above. 2) Argo's management team is in flux . A new CEO, Thomas Chippas, was just hired. Most recently the CEO of CBOE Digital and a former member of its Board, Mr. Chippas ""is a New York-based executive with significant experience in digital assets, technology and financial services. He has previously held the positions of Chief Executive Officer of Citadel Technology LLC, Chief Operating Officer of Axoni and Managing Director of Citigroup, Barclays and Deutsche Bank. He also serves as a director of TS Imagine."" Notwithstanding a good resume, he and the rest of the Argo management team have a lot to prove. 3) Argo's success is highly dependent on the Bitcoin price and mining fee levels . 4) Argo's success is also highly dependent on the cost of electricity. 5) With a weak balance sheet, Argo's future success is dependent on being able to raise capital in the capital markets. There is no guarantee that it will be able to do. That said, the opportunity appears to exist now, and I am hoping management will take advantage, even if it is to the detriment of the equity holders. Conclusion In summary, while its financial problems are readily apparent, the Bonds of Argo are worth speculating on, in my view, given the rise of the Bitcoin price, Argo's improving debt profile and the increased likelihood that another equity raise is likely, if not certain, given the need for capital and the stock price's recent rise (which provide cover for Argo's Board to do such an equity raise). In short, the Bonds are a Speculative Buy, while the equity of Argo is a Hold. Happy New Year! P.S. A portfolio update heading into 2024 is below.

Whale Transfers 47 million XRP To Cryptocurrency Exchanges A report has shown that a whale has shifted approximately 47 million XRP tokens to crypto exchanges. Data from the on-chain tracker Whale Alert revealed the funds were moved to centralized exchanges (CEXs) in two distinct transfers. Related Reading: XRP Whales Show Exchange Inflow Activity, Bad Sign For Price? The two whale transactions came in light of the token experiencing a price decline. The first transfer saw about 24,800,000 XRP tokens valued at $15,463,840 being moved to the crypto exchange Bitso. Data from the on-chain tracker shows that the unknown wallet address r4wf7enWPx…5XgwHh4Rzn made the move 11 hours ago. The second transaction shifted about 23,800,000 XRP which was valued at $14,840,298 at the time of transfer. Whale Alert reported that the same wallet address mentioned above also made the transfer to another crypto exchange Bitstamp. This is not a surprise as the stated wallet has been making such huge transfers to both Bitso and Bitstamp exchanges. On Wednesday, December 27, the same wallet address was reported moving over 49 million XRP to the centralized exchanges. The whale transaction also took place in two distinct transfers. The wallet address moved 22.90 million XRP valued at approximately $14 million to Bitstamp. Meanwhile, the second transaction was reported to have witnessed 16.50 million XRP worth about $10.43 million moved to the Mexican-based exchange Bitso. The movement of XRP to the stated CEXs via the same wallet address has become a regular occurrence in the cryptocurrency space. This might be due to Ripple‘s strategic partnership with Bitstamp and Bitso, in which the CEXs make use of Ripple’s payment services. Could The Price Of The Crypto Asset Reach $2,500? Crypto expert Egrag Crypto recently revealed an intriguing story of his conversation about the pricing of XRP with a prominent banker. The analyst shared the story with the entire crypto community on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Explode 58,000% To $352 The conversation revolved around the token, as both figures examined how the altcoin might reach a value of $2,500 soon. The discussion arose when the banker challenged Egrag to clarify how 40,000 XRP could ultimately equal $100 million. Taking up the challenge, Egrag showed the banker how the asset would reach $2,500 using a chart he posted alongside. According to the chart, the token might reach this price level by 2029. Due to this, the banker has considered the digital asset a long-term investment, as he believes it could result in enormous gains by then. Currently, the token’s price is sitting at $0.629, indicating a decline of about 1.60% in the past 24 hours. Its trading volume is also down by over 20%, while its market cap is down by 1.68%.

42391722,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfuacL,1703843484,Indonesian Authorities Crack Down on Bitcoin Miners Stealing Electricity From National Grid,"Indonesian authorities raided ten sites suspected of mining bitcoin with stolen electricity from the national grid over the Christmas weekend.  Although Indonesia is a fast-growing crypto adopter, it’s not exactly known as a hub for mining.  However, under Indonesian law, electricity theft is considered a criminal offense with a penalty of up to five years in prison or a fine of up to twice the value of the unpaid electricity.  Indonesia’s neighbor Malaysia has made several arrests in relation to electricity theft by crypto miners, but this is among the first reported cases in Indonesia.  At the raided sites in Medan, North Sumatra, authorities found 1,314 bitcoin rigs, and 26 individuals were detained.  The suspects allegedly stole electricity by tapping into utility poles of state-owned electricity company PLN poles over the past six months, worth around 14.4 billion Indonesian rupiah ($100,000) in losses to the state.  That may seem small, but it amounts to around 10 million kilowatt hours at recent local energy prices and is equivalent to the yearly energy consumption of around 7,500 individuals in the country.  An official from PLN told a local news outlet Thursday that the company will be working with authorities on similar cases.

The selection process for the collection will be based on criteria such as the number of holders, liquidity thresholds, project maturity, principles of a fair launch and overall social sentiment, among other factors, the foundation said in a post on X.  ""The Avalanche Foundation intends to start using Culture Catalyst to recognize and encourage the culture and fun symbolized by meme coins by purchasing select Avalanche-based meme coins to create a collection,"" it said. ""This move complements the Avalanche Foundation's ongoing engagement across the Avalanche ecosystem, including NFTs, RWAs, and other types of cryptoassets, broadening its portfolio to embrace a more complete spectrum of possibilities.""  Several Avalanche-based meme coins, including COQ, husky (HUSKY) and shibx (SHIBX), have gained as much as 25% in the past 24 hours, with the majority of these gains coming after Avalanche’s post, data from CoinGecko shows.  Meme coins are often considered a scammy part of the market among blockchain purists, but the success of this niche – led by the likes of dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) – could be starting to change the stigma associated with investing in such tokens.  In early December, a sudden surge in the price of bonk helped spur volumes on Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) ahead of Ethereum, the usual leader. Solana Saga phones sold out as they doled out BONK rewards to their owners, despite sales being moribund as recently as October.  The meme-coin frenzy spread to the Avalanche network in mid-December with the rise of hen-themed Coq Inu (COQ) and dog tokens such as kimbo (KIMBO). The riches followed: A single trader apparently acquired just over $450 worth of COQ shortly after its issuance and the amount has since ballooned to over $2.5 million, CoinDesk reported last week.  There is a cultural aspect to the sector's appeal, Avalanche said.  “These coins, often inspired by internet culture and humor, go beyond mere utility assets; they represent the collective spirit and shared interests of diverse crypto communities,” the post read.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB | BONK,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | SHIB | BONK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/29/avalanche-foundation-to-purchase-meme-coins-as-part-of-culture-drive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19f01e94a28abcfe1f950f52c95eea6c5b0ead80-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Wednesday, just over 28,000 BTC worth $1.19 billion left centralized exchanges, the largest single-day outflow in BTC terms since Dec. 14, 2022, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  Net outflows from exchanges are often taken to represent investors' intention to take direct custody of coins or preference for a long-term holding strategy.  The Nasdaq-listed Coinbase, which is the custodian for nine of the 12 proposed spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., alone saw an outflow of over 18,000 BTC on Wednesday, per analytics firm CryptoQuant. (Almost a day after this story was initially published, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted on X regarding this statistic: ""This is false. Way off from our internal data."") That has the crypto community on social media platform X speculating about institutional activity ahead of an expected ETF launch in early January.  The overall BTC balance in wallets tied to centralized exchanges has dropped to 2,327,025 BTC, the lowest since April 2018. Other things being equal, fewer coins on an exchange mean weakening supply-side pressures and potential for price appreciation.

Before the price broke out this week, there were two more failed breakout efforts in November and December. The $1.07 peak on Wednesday is the highest since April. It is noteworthy that MATIC has failed to close each week above the resistance trend line. Furthermore, some analysts say that MATIC may soon reach new peaks as it tries to keep a solid footing within – or even past – the $1 territory.

Martinez thinks that a strong upward advance that might push MATIC towards the $1.73 price level could occur if Polygon is able to maintain a weekly candlestick close above the $0.96 threshold. #Polygon is on the verge of a breakout from a symmetrical triangle.
