28348231,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609531,1716505246,"Bitcoin Will Hit $80,000 In May Despite Outflows To Ethereum: Analyst","Bitcoin is fast-dropping, looking at price action in the daily chart. Even after the impressive spike above $71,500 early this week, there needs to be a conclusive follow-through for optimistic bulls. Despite this correction, one analyst strongly believes Bitcoin will rally sharply, reaching $80,000 by the end of the month. Will Bitcoin Hit $80,000 By End Of May? Taking to X, the analyst thinks HODLers, not speculators, will reap the maximum benefits from Bitcoin. Based on the trader’s assessment, not only will BTC fly above $80,000 by the end of May, but the coin will also spike to peak at $95,000 in June. Accordingly, reading from the candlestick arrangement, those who position themselves at spot rates might enter at favorable prices, scooping the coin at a discount. Even so, when BTC flies to $95,000 in less than seven weeks from now, the trader expects prices to cool off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Drop Below $70,000 Apparently Driven By Lack Of Interest, Glassnode Data Shows The retracement will also wash out speculators hitching the leg up. At spot rates, the path of least resistance is northward. BTC is also down roughly 6% from this week’s highs, although the uptrend remains. The $72,000 line is emerging as a strong resistance level as prices continue to move horizontally. On the lower end, $60,000 is worth watching. For the uptrend to take shape, a high volume must be close to $72,000. Of note is that bulls have yet to breach and close above this line since the surge to all-time highs in mid-March. Capital Is Flowing To Ethereum: Will The United States SEC Reject Spot ETH ETFs? Sentiment will play a key role in propelling prices higher. So far, the analyst acknowledges that there is a shift in sentiment. As the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unexpectedly prepares to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors have been rotating capital to ETH. This has slowed the momentum, even lowering prices, as in the current case. The ETHBTC price chart shows that Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin, adding 25% from mid-May 2024. Related Reading: Non-Empty USDC And USDT Wallets See 13.9% And 15.7% Spike, Why This Is Good For Crypto There has been no official communication from the United States SEC on spot ETH ETF approval.

Analyzing Bitcoin's (BTC) price action reveals an initial strong performance, a ""sell the news"" dip, and a subsequent rally. ETH's ETF approval is likely to result in similar price action. Our strategy is to be long on ETH before the ETF approval and listing, anticipating strong pre-listing performance while buying dips before reaching a new all-time high. Introduction After months of anticipation, it has finally arrived. The Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ) ETF has been approved by the SEC . Following Bitcoin USD's ( BTC-USD ) turn on January 10th, it's now ETH's moment. In this article, we'll draw inspiration from the BTC ETF approval episode to explore potential outcomes for ETH. First, we'll examine BTC's price action around and after its ETF approval date. Then, we'll analyze whether ETH's current situation mirrors BTC's situation at the time of its approval on January 10th, highlighting both similarities and differences. These analyses, combined with our own interpretations, will guide you to our recommendations on how to play what comes after the ETH ETF approval event. BTC Price Action And Market Dynamics Before, During And After The Approval The BTC path to ETF approval has been long and full of obstacles. Yet, each hurdle has been overcome one by one, impacting thus BTC's price action. According to Reuters , the 29th of August 2023: The U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeals on Tuesday ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was wrong to reject an application from crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments to list an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin. Right after this news, the BTC reacted positively and printed a +6% intraday performance. Bloomberg However, despite this positive news, BTC performed poorly over the following two months. We identified several reasons for this: The US 10Y rate increased from 4.1% to 4.6%, putting pressure on risky assets like BTC. The possibility of the SEC appealing the court decision, while having 45 days to file an appeal. On October 13, 2023, the SEC decided not to appeal the court decision . This move surprised many investors, as it signalled the SEC's acknowledgment of its error and paved the way for a review of BTC ETF products that investors had been closely monitoring for years. Following this decision, BTC experienced a strong rally, gaining 70% from October 13 to January 9. Bloomberg On January 11th, after a decade-long battle, the SEC finally approved 10 ETF proposals from issuers like BlackRock, ARKK, VanEck, and Fidelity. Immediately after this, the ETF approval was seen as a ""sell the news event."" for two weeks. However, BTC then rallied strongly, reaching a new all-time high of $73 664 on March 11th. From January 11th to March 11th, BTC surged another 60%. Bloomberg This rally has been supported by strong ETF inflows. However, this demand has been decreasing since the 18th of March. Bloomberg The decrease in demand has been accompanied by substantial outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ((BTC)) ( GBTC ), which held nearly 600,000 BTC prior to the ETF approval. This accounted for just over 3% of the total BTC supply. These outflows were primarily due to higher fees, with GBTC fees at 1.5% compared to the new ETF at 0.30%. The red zone highlighted shows consistent and strong outflows matching with a period of lower inflows in BTC's ETF, thus justifying poor BTC performance from March to April. You can have a detailed view of the outflows on the following graph: Bloomberg However, the outflows have now stabilized following Grayscale's decision to lower its fees. Currently, GBTC holds close to 290,000 BTC. Since the 14th of March, the BTC has been rangy and has tested successfully several times its key 60k level. Bloomberg What Conclusions Can We Draw From This Price Action? BTC performed strongly before the ETF approval. However, its approval led to a ""sell the news"" event lasting two weeks. Despite this, strong inflows have supported the asset price, although these inflows have been offset by GBTC outflows. After reaching its all-time high, BTC has been trading within a range for two months. What About ETH Price action? Will we see a similar price action for ETH? In our view, it's likely. However, there are several key differences to consider. First, ETH ETF approval was unpopular. Consensus views shifted dramatically, with the probability of approval rising from 25% to 70% just four days before the decision. Polymarket Why did the SEC change its stance? In our view, primarily for political reasons. The U.S. government is beginning to recognize the growing significance of crypto among Americans. In an election year, losing valuable votes is not an option. That's why on the 20th of May, according to CoinDesk : The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked aspiring ether exchange-traded fund exchanges to update 19b-4 filings ahead of a key deadline this week. Due to this surprising shift in market expectations, ETH's price sharply rallied, gaining 22% in two days. BTC also saw strong performance before its approval, but it was a more gradual rise as it had more time to be anticipated. We wouldn't be surprised to see ETH rally even more sharply than BTC, driven by investors eager to ""catch the train"" they might have missed with BTC. Bloomberg Several additional factors could influence ETH price actions. ETH features a staking mechanism, with many participants willing to stake their ETH for clients. ETH ETF Issuers (Bloomberg) However, the SEC has required the removal of the staking feature from ETF applications. The ability to earn a yield on an asset is particularly appealing, so the absence of staking in these ETFs makes them less attractive than simply holding and staking ETH. Nevertheless, we still view the ETF as an interesting product for both institutional and retail investors, ensuring robust demand. Another key consideration is the uncertainty surrounding the ETF launch date. The SEC, issuers, and exchanges have spent months negotiating the 19b-4 and S-1 documents for BTC, a process that has just begun for ETH. This could take weeks or even months to finalize. Additionally, ETH's market cap is three times smaller than BTC's, making it more volatile and easier to move in either direction. We see this as a positive, especially considering that major players like BlackRock and JP Morgan have a positive outlook on ETH. Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( OTCQX:ETHE ) holds almost 2.5% of the ETH float, which could create short-to-medium-term selling pressure similar to what we saw with GBTC. However, we expect Grayscale to avoid past mistakes and implement lower fees, reducing outflow pressure. Our strategy Post-approval, there might be a ""sell the news"" event, similar to what happened with BTC. When the BTC spot ETF was approved in January, it was unprecedented. BTC steadily increased before the approval, surged upon approval, and then dropped about 22% before sharply rising to new highs. We expect a similar trend for ETH, but we advise against trading on this expectation. It's wiser to maintain exposure to ETH, as the outcome might differ this time. Those who sold BTC at the time of approval missed out if they didn't repurchase at lower prices, and there's a risk of not catching those lower prices. We recommend buying dips. The ""sell the news"" event and potential Grayscale outflows should they occur, could present attractive buying opportunities. We see opportunities to accumulate after a retrace between $2900 and $3200 that has been historically strong support and resistance levels. Bloomberg Finally, as with BTC, ETH might experience some weakness after surpassing its all-time high. We suggest progressively reducing your exposure to ETH once it surpasses its ATH of $4,666. Conclusion We have the conviction that the ETH ETF approval is a significant milestone. It represents in our view a strong opportunity. Analyzing BTC's price action reveals an initial strong performance, a ""sell the news"" dip, and a subsequent rally. We expect a similar pattern for ETH with some specificities related to its market cap, ETF listing dates, stacking features, and Grayscale potential outflow impact. Our strategy is to be long on ETH before the ETF approval and listing, anticipating strong pre-listing performance. Post-listing, we expect a ""sell the news"" event but advise maintaining exposure to ETH to avoid missing out on potential gains. We recommend buying dips, especially between $2900 and $3200, and gradually reducing exposure once ETH surpasses its all-time high of $4,666.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4695384-ethereum-etf-approval-what-bitcoins-history-teaches-us?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28347019.jpeg

Recent analyses by renowned crypto experts Ali and Captain Faibik have identified key patterns and technical signals indicating a possible bullish breakout for AXS. The analysts observed an inverted head and shoulders pattern on the weekly chart of AXS, a classic technical indicator often associated with the reversal of a downtrend and the start of a bullish phase. Related Reading: Axie Infinity Co-Founder Losses Over $10 Million In Hack, AXS Holds Firm Major Rally Predicted For Axie Infinity (AXS) Ali predicts that if AXS can successfully break through the $13 resistance level, it could trigger a rally, pushing the price toward $22 or higher. Captain Faibik shares this optimism, pointing out a bullish trajectory on the 8-hour timeframe. #AxieInfinity appears to form an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the weekly chart, which anticipates $AXS to rise toward the neckline at $13 before a potential breakout to $22. pic.twitter.com/99kVKwUrwc — Ali (@ali_charts) May 23, 2024 Faibik noted a decisive breakout from a significant falling logarithmic trend and suggested that, following a retest phase, AXS might experience a surge of up to 40 percent in the near term. $AXS Major Trendline Breakout & Retest has confirmed on the 8hr timeframe Chart.. ✅ Looks Promising for the +40% Bullish Rally in the near term. 📈#Crypto #AXS #AXSUSDT pic.twitter.com/VrxIndGIDc — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) May 23, 2024 Despite the positive technical outlook, Axie Infinity has faced challenges, including a significant drop in user engagement. Following its crash in February 2022, the token AXS has since fallen from its all-time high of $164 in November 2021, plummeting by 95%. The asset is currently trading at around $7.72, an increase of 0.9% in the past 24 hours and nearly 8% over the past week. This price movement coincides with a generally bullish trend in the global crypto market, fueled by anticipation of Altcoin ETFs’ approval, particularly for Ethereum. Axie Infinity is currently ranked as the 87th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, maintaining a valuation of around $1.1 billion. The 24-hour trading volume for AXS stands just above $41 million. Despite its mid-cap status, Axie Infinity’s network metrics have declined, such as unique active wallets (UAW) and volume. DappRadar data shows a 5% decrease in UAW and a 49% drop in volume over the past 24 hours, with current UAW at 43,500 and volume slightly above $1 million. Recent Security Breach and Future Outlook The backdrop of these market dynamics includes a recent security incident involving Jeff “Jihoz” Zirlin, co-founder of Sky Mavis, the company behind Axie Infinity. In February, two of Zirlin’s crypto wallets were compromised, leading to the theft of over $10 million in various crypto assets, primarily RON, the native token of Ronin Chain. This chain is an Ethereum sidechain designed specifically for Axie Infinity. Zirlin confirmed that the breach was limited to his accounts and did not impact the Ronin chain or Sky Mavis operations. He emphasized that the stolen private keys were not connected to the company’s internal systems and reassured the community of strict security measures for all chain-related activities. Despite the setback, Zirlin remains optimistic about the future and is committed to bringing economic freedom to users through Axie Infinity.

42418086,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcZg5,1716498993,"Ether ETFs Clear Major Hurdle, Though SEC Hasn't Cleared Them for Trading Yet","Ether ETFs took a major step toward becoming available in the U.S. as the SEC approved key regulatory filings.  Just days ago, prospects for the ETFs looked bleak.  Spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds took a giant leap toward reality on Thursday after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved key regulatory filings tied to them, a milestone for the second-largest cryptocurrency.  They are not yet cleared to trade, though. The SEC gave its blessing to so-called 19b-4 forms tied to the ETFs, but the regulator must approve their S-1 filings before investors can buy them.  The approval follows a stunning turnaround by the markets regulator. After clearing spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, the SEC didn't seem to engage much with issuers on ether ETFs. That changed in recent days.  ""A week ago, I would've said you were a little crazy to think that these ETFs were going to get SEC approval,"" James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an interview ahead of the decision.  In a statement, a Grayscale spokesperson confirmed the regulator had approved its 19b-4.  ""At Grayscale, we appreciate the opportunity to engage constructively with regulators as they review spot Ethereum ETFs, and we remain optimistic about the potential of bringing Ethereum further into the US regulatory perimeter in the ETF wrapper,"" they said.  Would-be spot ether ETF issuers include BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Ark/21Shares and Invesco/Galaxy.  Although the approval of the 19b-4 filings suggests that regulators are willing to allow issuers to bring a spot ether ETF on the market, it doesn't guarantee that they will ultimately approve the final S-1 forms filed by all issuers.  ""There is likely to be a gap before we see S-1 approvals and these ETFs begin trading. My guess is that this will take at least a week, but likely more. If history is any guide it could be much longer and be measured in months. But I personally think the gap will be measured in weeks. Everyone is just guessing right now though.” Seyffart said.  Regulators sent a shock wave through the industry on Monday when reports came out that issuers were asked to update their 19b-4 filings ahead of the SEC's deadline to approve or deny one of the issuers, VanEck’s filing.  Read more: Ether ETFs Filing Process Sees Abrupt Progress, Though Approval Not Guaranteed: Sources  An SEC spokesperson said the agency would not comment beyond what's in the order published Thursday.  In a statement, 21Shares Head of Legal Andrew Jacobson said the approval was ""a significant step in the right direction.""  Cboe Global Head of ETP Listings Rob Marrocco said the exchange, which plans to list five different spot ether ETF products, was ""excited to expand our offerings"" to the ETFs. The 19b-4 approval is a step toward those listings.  ""The introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs in January has already demonstrated significant benefits for the digital assets and ETF space, and we believe that spot Ether ETFs will similarly provide safeguards for U.S. investors, allowing them to gain Ether exposure in a transparent, well-regulated and easily accessible structure,"" he said.

He made this statement while revealing the sums lost by short traders thanks to their bearish sentiment around the meme coin. Dogwifhat Headed To $10 Unipcs mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogwifhat is “headed to $10” and will never drop to as low as $1 again. He added that the market is currently in a meme coin supercycle, which is why he believes the meme coin can attain such heights. The crypto trader also highlighted how WIF shorts were “getting squeezed hard” and said this is the “way it should be.” Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Set For A New ATH Above $73,700, You Won’t Believe The Timeline Besides Dogwifhat, Unipcs generally has a bullish outlook towards meme coins. He earned a reputation for longing Bonk, another Solana-based meme coin, with $16,000 in October 2023 and still holding as at the last time he shared an update on the trade. Based on his update, his unrealized profit has risen to as high as $13.7 million at some point. Unipcs’s bullishness on meme coins is also not surprising, considering this category of crypto tokens is projected as one of the leading narratives in this bull run. It is also worth noting that meme coins Dogwifhat and Pepe (PEPE) are currently this year’s best-performing crypto assets among the top 50 coins by market cap, with year-to-date (YTD) gains of over 1,800% and 1,000%, respectively. Unipcs isn’t the only one who believes that WIF could rise to $10. Another crypto trader known as ‘Free’ has also reaffirmed on different occasions that the meme coin will still rise to that price level. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Bluntz Capital is also ultra-bullish on Dogwifhat, as he once suggested that the meme coin will flip PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to become the second-largest meme coin by market cap, only behind Dogecoin (DOGE). This Crypto Analyst Has Other Expectations Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently revealed his bearish expectations for meme coins, including WIF. He foresees a “meme wipeout,” which could be worse than he initially thought. He added that this occurrence would “catch a ton of people off guard.” He claimed he would become a meme coin bull when the time is right, but now is not the right time. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Can’t Reach $0.01, Crypto Pundit Reveals Why In a recent video posted on his YouTube channel, CrediBULL Crypto also analyzed Dogwifhat. He noted that WIF had significantly moved to the upside, as he rightly predicted in an earlier market update. Back then, he mentioned that he was expecting the meme coin to rise to $3.8 before it dropped to as low as $1.6. However, in his recent video, he revealed that he won’t be shorting Dogwifhat even when it reaches $3.8. Instead, he will wait for the meme coin to claim the untapped highs at the $4 range to validate his bearish expectations. At the time of writing, Dogwifhat is trading at around $3, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418075,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcZUj,1716493699,Is the House’s FIT21 Bill Really the Legislation That Crypto Needs?,"The House voted 279 to 136 on Wednesday to pass the much heralded Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which has been cast as a major win for the industry considering this is the furthest any crypto-focused legislation has made it thus far in the U.S. The bill, which saw support from the vast majority of Republicans as well as 71 Democrats, will now head to the Senate – though likely not this year.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  If passed, the bill would set up a regulatory framework for digital assets, helping to define when a certain token is a security or commodity. While the bill is largely thought to increase the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s oversight of crypto, the Securities and Exchange Commission would likely continue to play a significant role in regulating the industry.  While many have said the bill is something of a turning point for crypto in the U.S., not everyone thinks it will pan out as expected.  “It does not even shift agencies; SEC would still have huge power. It provides for a dual regulatory regime, split between SEC and CFTC. It does this by giving the CFTC authority it never had--regulatory authority over a spot commodities market,” crypto legal expert Gabriel Shapiro said on X. “Man we have been psyopped so bad on this FIT21 thing.”  “There has never before been a spot commodities market that is *regulated*...we are just handing this authority over wholesale to the CFTC and hoping they are not insane fascists like Gary (but he used to be head of CFTC lol),” he added.  In other words, the bill is essentially a way for the government to sanction activities that the industry has already been doing without permission, and potentially sets up an agency to interfere with what are supposedly free and open markets.  It was a point echoed by Stephen Palley, another leading legal voice in crypto, who said he does “not like [it] at all.”  “It needlessly creates more jurisdiction for CFTC over spot and a walled garden for incumbents, among other things. But you dipshits kept asking for new laws,” Palley, a partner at Brown Rudnick, added.  Somewhat ironically, Shapiro and Palley’s criticisms seem to line up with Maxine Waters (D-CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, who said it was the one of the worst bills she's ever seen. In addition to potentially stretching the resources of the CFTC, which only has around 700 employees compared to the SEC’s 4,500, it may also undermine other legislative efforts – like the stablecoin bill Waters worked on alongside House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC).  See also: CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative Action  ""Let me let you [in] on a secret that the big crypto doesn't want you to know even under this bill,"" Waters said. ""The CFTC does not get enough authority to regulate crypto in this bill.""  Likewise, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said the effort would create more confusion and regulatory gaps than it closes. Gensler has said for years that the law is clear, and that there should not be bespoke rules for crypto.  Regardless, many in the crypto industry have seen the bipartisan vote as a symbolic vote for crypto itself, perhaps a harbinger of a better future. The move comes just days after the House and Senate voted to repeal a controversial SEC accounting rule, which itself was seen as a sign that sanity will ultimately prevail.  If there is a silver lining, many experts think FIT21 is likely to die on the vine. TD Cowen, for instance, said a few weeks ago the bill stood ""no chance of becoming law in this Congress.” So maybe this is one psyop worth celebrating?",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/23/is-the-houses-fit21-bill-really-the-legislation-that-crypto-needs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24ec27165ae8f4d7f9645c87f93da7f6ef28bf1b-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Investors’ and market watchers’ optimism has increased as the ‘King of altcoins’ surpasses the $3,900 mark. Some analysts believe this bullish momentum could soon propel ETH’s price above all established price targets. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Come Alive: Are They Buying Or Selling? Ethereum Soars Amid ETF Approval Expectation Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen a significant uptick this week. As rumors of ETH spot ETFs being approved this Wednesday surged, the community’s sentiment towards the asset turned extremely bullish. Previously, Bloomberg experts had asserted that chances of an ETF approval were slim due to the US government’s crackdown on the industry. However, this week’s U-turn from the Biden administration sparked a positive sentiment that increased the chances to 65-75%. As a result, Ethereum surged an impressive 30.4% from its price seven days ago. The King of altcoins went from trading just below the $3,000 mark to surpassing the $3,900 resistance level at the time of writing. The community’s optimistic expectations continue as several US lawmakers urge SEC chair Gary Gensler to approve Ethereum ETFs. As reported by Eric Balchunas, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers sent a letter on Tuesday to the SEC’s Chair asking for the approval of ETH ETFs “and other digital assets.” According to the letter, the Congress members believe digital asset-backed ETFs offer “investors a regulated and transparent investment vehicle to gain exposure.” The US lawmakers urged the Commission to “maintain a consistent and equitable approach when reviewing upcoming applications” for other crypto ETFs. Are Price Targets Too Low? Ethereum has performed remarkablely over the past few days. ETH has surged 5.6% as the community awaits the SEC’s decision. As pointed out by several market watchers, ETH’s weekly candle is resting levels not seen since the first half of March. Crypto Yoddha highlighted Ethereum’s historic behavior for the previous all-time high (ATH) runs. Per the chart, the second-largest crypto asset went through a 700-day accumulation phase before breaking out and starting the bullish run. Similarly, ETH seemingly ended a 700-day accumulation period this cycle, which could lead to a rally towards a new ATH, if history repeats. The analyst set a target of $15,300 for this cycle. Likewise, Crypto Jelle pointed out that ETH broke out of a multi-month falling wedge pattern. Its recent performance successfully reclaimed the key resistance above the $3,600 mark and is currently testing the $3,900 price range. The trader considers that, if this is the current performance before the approval of ETH ETFs, his $10,000 target for this cycle might be “too low.” However, he urged investors to “try not to get sucked into overtrading.” He considers the initial response to the decision “hard to know” despite the bullish sentiment. Ultimately, Jelle suggests the community to “focus on what you know” as the long-term outlook is much clearer. Related Reading: Altcoins ‘Maniac Phase’ Preparing, Analysts Call For Next Leg Up On a similar note, Crypto analyst Mikybull points out that ETH is repeating the 2020 path that “sparked off Alts season in 2021.” Due to this, the trader considers that the bull targets for this cycle are $9,000-$11,000. The SEC’s decision regarding ETH ETFs will be announced around 8:30 pm UTC on May 23.

The CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, introduced by Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), seeks to block the U.S. central bank from continuing efforts toward the development of a digital dollar. Republicans expressed concerns that a U.S. CBDC could be used to control Americans.  Democrats said during debate before Thursday's vote that the concerns were overblown and a ban would block public sector innovation and research. Overall, 213 Republicans and three Democrats voted for the bill, while 192 Democrats voted against it.  Thursday's vote count is a far cry from a vote the day before, when 71 Democrats joined 208 Republicans in voting for the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, a crypto market structure bill that would give the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission greater spot market authority over digital assets and spells out how another key U.S. markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, can approach the sector.  Industry participants hailed Wednesday's vote, the first for a bill focused solely on crypto market issues, as a sign that the sector was finally receiving recognition as being significant.  ""The House passage of FIT21 represents a watershed moment and badge of Congressional validation for the crypto industry in the United States,"" said Kristin Smith, who heads up the Blockchain Association, an industry lobby group.  Nicole Valentine, the director of FinTech at the Milken Institute, similarly called the passage a ""welcome step.""  However, both the market structure and the anti-CBDC bills seem headed toward similar fates in the Senate – going nowhere – given that half of congress does not have a counterpart for either piece of legislation.

42418072,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcZRd,1716487725,Are Sideline Skeptics Crypto’s Biggest Enemy or Greatest Strength?,"Blockchain technology and its user base might be growing apart. As the industry has made leaps and bounds in progress over the past five years in terms of its technical capabilities and financial acumen, it’s hard to say that its audience has evolved the same way.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing package. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  Roy Blackstone is creative director of SHADOW WAR.  Sure, you have far fewer scammers and self-proclaimed wunderkinds percolating through the ecosystem than before thanks to the last bear market. But the hyper-online troll and commentator culture is still the public face of the crypto industry to many. Across online platforms, social media outlets, and industry conferences, voices continually seek to influence the trajectory of crypto and help HODLers navigate the market’s turbulent waters.  Amid the noise of opinions, however, a critical question must be addressed: Are these critics merely sideline observers, or do they hold concrete power to drive progress within the industry? As crypto sheds its fringe status, it’s time to reckon with its cottage industry of critics and influencers.  Balancing contributions and critiques  Every industry has a set of commentators—from sports to entertainment to politics—and each sector has pundits armed with words, ideas, and a varying degree of influence and credibility. However, for an internet-native industry like crypto which relies on digital forums for communication, online communities play a pivotal role in shaping perceptions, influencing decision-making, and driving overall market trends.  The blockchain industry's growth offers newcomers a chance to explore emerging financial tools and decentralized finance. While it has gained positive traction, the pool of builders still remains relatively small. The crypto landscape is filled with many participants with little to no experience in tech or finance but who are still eager to contribute their perspectives and support to this expanding space.  As such, platforms like X, Telegram and Discord, alongside crypto influencers, have become the lifeblood of many Web3 projects – and feedback can propagate across the internet, reaching a vast audience in a matter of moments. Elon Musk is an evergreen example, with his posts on X about cryptocurrencies consistently having a noticeable impact on the market. So clearly, there is an amplified influence from outside voices on the trajectory of crypto and associated projects.  The benefits? Social platforms have become grounds for new projects to grow by authentically inserting themselves into crypto discussions.  TAG Heuer, for example, used X to launch the luxury watch brand’s move into Web3. As a result, NFTs rose to fifth on the list of interest of the brand’s followers on X from 13% before the launch. This shows how brands looking to enter the Web3 space turn to user-first platforms like X to establish a presence where their target audience congregates rather than relying solely on traditional marketing methods.  With that said, in a niche industry like crypto, its inherently online culture makes it exceptionally susceptible to trolls – and the more ridiculous or outrageous their ridicule, the greater the potential to frustrate. Since crypto communities are tribal, they often become emotionally and financially invested in their favorite blockchain network or project, making them automatically defensive or resistant to critiques that challenge their interests.  It effectively applies “stan culture” to a very real financial and technological ecosystem. But does that mean every crypto critic is just a troll in disguise?  Minimizing the trust gap  When it’s constructive, criticism catalyzes progress—and crypto has proven no different. Constructive criticism and discussion can foster innovation, drive collaboration and help newcomers navigate its terrain.  Well-run organizations can leverage constructive criticism to tackle complex challenges as collaborative efforts are powered by shared knowledge. The ecosystem benefits from the critical eye of commentators, distinguishing real innovation from projects that blow smoke.  One way to address negative feedback about the industry is to put business founders in front of their audience. Engaging in open dialogue and discussions with critics is a productive way to ensure information circulating online is factual and not based on skeptics' feelings towards the project.  Virtual AMA (ask me anything) sessions through platforms such as Telegram, Reddit, X and YouTube allow project leaders to interact with community members, address pain points, and showcase their value. Sharing goals and updates about projects directly with the public fosters loyalty and a positive brand experience.  Even now, we’re witnessing the benefits of constructive criticism, as the common critique of crypto’s unprofessionalism and negligence has been addressed and piqued the interest of institutional players.  This shift in the regulatory interest of financial institutions is evidence that crypto builders should listen to and acknowledge their users' feedback. The more developers can embrace grounded critiques from their community, even from outsiders, the faster the ecosystem will mature and expand.  Criticism produces a torrent of responses, often obscuring the subject's underlying merits and exacerbating the industry's volatility. A concerted effort towards education, streamlined processes, and robust security is necessary to usher the next wave of crypto enthusiasts into the mainstream. By fostering familiarity and trust, the crypto ecosystem can transcend its reputation, paving the way for widespread adoption and growth.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Roy Blackstone,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/23/are-sideline-skeptics-cryptos-biggest-enemy-or-greatest-strength,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/158dea91242c67fe2289074ab64f876f403a9e5f-2174x1142.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418080,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcZYr,1716486767,"Wake Up, Web3: Your Marketing Is Fueling a Bot Epidemic","Web3 marketing has one fundamental problem: it focuses mainly on hype and disregards true users. This happens because big rewards have become the core of Web3 marketing. But boosting vanity metrics through giveaways isn’t what Web3 marketing, or what we call MarketingFi, is and should be about.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.  Right now, projects are distributing their marketing budgets to everyone who will come and like their Twitter post and give them a follow — think of quests like Galxe. This trend is a spark of potential that MarketingFi has yet to bring to market: instead of offering rewards to everyone for small actions, MarketingFi brings rewards to engaged users. Instead of giving small rewards to a lot of users (and bots and Sybil attackers), MarketingFi means larger rewards for users who bring quality to projects through participation in marketing activities.  Similar issues persist in the current state of Web3 KOL marketing — the second largest (after airdrops) and fastest-growing Web3 marketing trend. Currently, projects that conduct KOL rounds often onboard shillers with botted numbers who build and bring initial hype but don’t bring true users towards whom marketing budgets should be diverted. Why? Because they want to ‘make hype quick’ and have no way of measuring the actual impact of their campaigns.  Shillers (because, let’s be honest, they are not real KOLs) bring the hype, cost projects tens of thousands, and pass rewards and marketing budgets on unengaged users who leave the project as soon as it's out. Yet, in the data-powered MarketingFi, true KOLs have the potential to bring larger rewards and marketing budgets to audiences that will build projects further. But we need to employ analytics first, weed out the shillers, and bring larger incentives to the right creators.  So what exactly is MarketingFi, and how can Web3 get there already?  MarketingFi means data-driven marketing decisions in an ecosystem where users are more than customers — they are co-creators and co-owners. A significant shift in Web3 marketers’ thinking is necessary to make MarketingFi a standard. Projects must stop considering traditional business-user relationships and start seeing it as a collaborative co-ownership ecosystem. Think: “If my users hold my tokens, they want me to do the right marketing because my project’s growth benefits them - how can I pass my marketing budget onto them so they help me onboard more quality users?”. How do we find these engaged users, i.e., co-owners and collaborators? Look at your off- and on-chain data and bring significant incentives, rewards, and airdrops to those with the most quality. Give the community the tools and budgets to act.  70% of most airdrops go to bots  Currently, Web3 is in the midst of the Airdrop Summer. New airdrop campaigns with elements of social farming are popping up left and right. Budgets and rewards for these campaigns are enormous, generating interest, hype, and hope. Such airdrops are a classic example of giving rewards to the wrong crowd: users lured by the reward complete a series of social tasks (and sometimes a couple of on-chain tasks) to possibly receive an airdrop. Many don’t realize these users are often bots, airdrop hunters, or Sybil attackers — not the quality audience projects their communities want to onboard. Our recent study at Cookie3 showed that up to 70% of an airdrop is frequently passed onto bots and Sybil attackers.  Are airdrops killing Web3 then? No. Airdrops are excellent, but only when they attract quality users — i.e. when they are done right. Some projects slowly wake up to the idea, understanding that getting large numbers quickly doesn’t outweigh the benefits of onboarding quality users who stick. A great example is Layer Zero, which laid the rules for self-reporting Sybil activity.  Solutions that help project leaders and marketers exclude bots from an airdrop already exist in a market (like Cookie3 Airdrop Shield, which uses AI to determine bots-based activity). Now, a mindset shift is needed and an understanding that short-term success and hype aren’t worth the long-term retention sacrifice. How to implement this change? Using data insight to exclude bots from the airdrop and giving more tokens to a smaller group potentially builds sustained hype and growth for the project.  KOLs or shillers?  What about KOL marketing and KOL rounds? How to work with KOLs who bring quality audiences in? Which KOLs should be given marketing budgets to pass on to their audiences and ensure collaborative ecosystem growth?  Marketers must find ways to determine which KOLs bring quality users rather than further inflating the empty numbers. How? Employing analytics to see how users are converting from KOL promotion, which KOLs bring the most quality users, and working with KOLs who result in a desired conversion is one of the best ways to weed out the best KOLs aiding in quality marketing.  As this becomes a standard, more data on KOL quality will be available across the market, raising the overall quality of Web3 KOL marketing. At Cookie3, we are working on implementing such a solution with Cookie3 Affiliate, helping projects set straight terms and rules for onboarding KOLs onto KOL rounds, measuring actual conversion and quality impact, and offloading parts of the allocation to $COOKIE stakers, i.e., bringing engaged users wanting to explore new projects early on.  Despite Web3 marketing being different from Web2, one thing Web3 marketers must learn from traditional marketing — looking at numbers and knowing that an engaged and converted user is worth a thousand times more than a potential user or new non-quality follower. Only then should the Web3 element of MarektingFi kick in, and, in a true Web3 fashion, marketers should decentralize their budgets by passing them onto determined quality users as co-owners and collaborators, bringing sustained long-term growth.  Web3 markets need to wake up and realize that results-driven does not mean vanity metrics. Results driven in Web3 must be understood as data-powered decisions, community-driven campaigns, and long-term success building through directing budgets to users who bring quality to projects.

This particular case arose over a dispute about whether an arbitration clause in an initial contract should have controlled what happened in a subsequent contract tied to a Dogecoin {{DOGE}} sweepstakes competition the exchange held in 2021  ""The question whether these parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability can be answered only by determining which contract applies,"" according to the Thursday opinion written by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. ""When we home in on the conflict between the delegation clause in the first contract and forum selection clause in the second, the question is whether the parties agreed to send the given dispute to arbitration – and, per usual, that question must be answered by a court.""  That wasn't what Coinbase had hoped to hear. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.  ""Coinbase contends that our approach will invite chaos by facilitating challenges to delegation clauses,"" Jackson wrote in the court's opinion. ""We do not believe that such chaos will follow.""  The loss in this second highly technical case leaves Coinbase with a mixed record at the Supreme Court, having won its previous dispute over another arbitration matter.  ""Some you win. Some you lose,"" its chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, said in a post on X. ""We are grateful for having had the opportunity to present our case to the Court and appreciate the Court's consideration of this matter.""  Because the scenario outlined in this case is narrow and unusual, it ""will have limited applicability in arbitration-related jurisprudence going forward,"" said Richard Silberberg, an arbitration lawyer with Dorsey & Whitney and a director of the New York International Arbitration Center. ""The unanimous SCOTUS decision that a court, not an arbitrator, must decide whether the parties’ first agreement was superseded by the second was hardly surprising,"" he added, because previous rulings had pointed in that direction.  Bottom line, according to Rollo Baker, a founding partner with Elsberg Baker & Maruri:  ""The decision makes clear that where parties have two agreements, one that calls for arbitration and a later-executed agreement that calls for court resolution, it is not ‘unmistakably’ clear that the parties intended arbitrability to be resolved in arbitration,"" he said in an emailed statement.  While this case wasn't at the core of crypto, the Supreme Court is widely expected to eventually resolve the industry's legal battles with U.S. regulators, though it may take years for any of these cases to even appear before the high court.

28335418,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609421,1716485409,"Is $77,600 The Next Step For Bitcoin? On-Chain Pricing Model Hints So","Data from a Bitcoin pricing model based on an on-chain indicator suggests that $77,600 may be the level where the asset will see its next peak. Bitcoin MVRV Pricing Bands Could Provide Hints About What’s Next In a new post on X, analyst Ali discussed what the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Pricing Bands model could suggest about the cryptocurrency’s future. The MVRV ratio is a popular on-chain indicator that compares the Bitcoin market cap and realized cap. The former is just the total valuation of the asset at the current spot price, while the latter is a model that calculates the asset’s cap by assuming the “true” value of any coin in circulation is the price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Come Alive: Are They Buying Or Selling? The previous transfer of any coin on the network was likely the last time it changed hands, and thus, the price at that time would be its current cost basis. As such, the realized cap keeps track of the sum of the cost basis of every investor in the market. Therefore, the MVRV ratio tells us how the value the investors hold (the market cap) compares against the value they put in (the realized cap). Based on this indicator, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has developed a pricing bands model. Below is a chart showing what these pricing bands look like. The pricing bands in this model represent levels corresponding to a specific deviation from the mean for the MVRV ratio. From the chart, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency is currently above the price level, corresponding to a +0.5 standard deviation (SD) from the mean for the indicator. More specifically, the price level around $65,100 would be where the MVRV ratio would be +0.5 SD above its mean. The next major pricing band in this model is +1 SD, which currently corresponds to around $77,600. In the past, this level has been where at least local tops have been probable to form for BTC. As is visible in the graph, the rally top back in March also occurred when BTC broke this level. “Based on the MVRV Pricing Bands, if Bitcoin continues to trade above $65,125, the next local BTC top before a brief correction could be around $77,593!” notes the analyst. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals Trigger For 17% Polygon (MATIC) Rally From the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, a potential rally to a new all-time high of $77,593 would mean an increase of more than 11% for the asset. It now remains to be seen how the asset’s price will develop from here and whether it will be able to maintain above the +0.5 SD MVRV level. BTC Price Since its sharp surge earlier, Bitcoin’s bullish momentum appears to have cooled off as the asset has fallen to sideways movement around the $69,700 mark.

The platform suggested that the flagship isn’t yet seeing enough demand, which could send its price to new highs. Demand For Bitcoin Is Still Modest In one of its latest market reports, Glassnode mentioned that “the rate at which new capital is flowing into the Bitcoin network has slowed down considerably from its peak.” They made this assertion based on the Realized Cap metric, which measures the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was traded. Glassnode claimed that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap is currently at $574 billion. Related Reading: XRP Price Nears Major Converging Point: Analyst Predicts 3,600% Jump To $20 The platform further revealed that the injection of liquidity into Bitcoin has cooled off since the flagship crypto hit an all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. This is in stark contrast to the period before Bitcoin hit that ATH, with Glassnode noting that the flows into Bitcoin back then were “extremely sharp, culminating at a value of $3.38 billion daily.” Meanwhile, Glassnode stated that the Realized Cap “remains in positive profit-dominated territory and is returning towards an equilibrium position.” However, they noted that Bitcoin’s modest demand was still able to spark this recent rally thanks to the “declining sell-side headwinds from mature investors.” Basically, Glassnode suggested that things were looking up for Bitcoin but that it could be way better if there were more capital inflows. There could indeed be an increase in capital inflows soon enough, considering that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have broken their streak of net outflows and are once again recording impressive net inflows into their funds. Data from Farside Investors shows that these funds have already seen almost $700 million in net inflows this week. Specifically, these Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of $305.7 million on May 21 alone. That day was also BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) most profitable day yet, with the fund taking in $290 million. Some Positive Key Takeaways Glassnode also assessed some other vital on-chain metrics, which provided some positives for Bitcoin’s future trajectory. The platform noted that there has been a “large decline” in Bitcoin’s Sell-Side Risk Ratio, which “suggests the market has found a degree of equilibrium over the course of this correction.” To assess market volatility, they also measured the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 60 days. They concluded that “volatility continues to compress to levels typically seen after lengthy consolidations and prior to large market moves.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Spend $6.3 Billion In One Day As Historic BTC Buy Signal Appears Meanwhile, Glasnode revealed that 2.14M BTC out of the Short-term holder (STH) supply, currently at 3.36M BTC, fell into an unrealized loss following the recent market correction. They claim that this suggests that many of the BTC held by this category of investors are held at an unrealized loss, which reduces the risk of top-heaviness developing.

Fantom Opera is its a standalone network that focuses on decentralized finance, while the new Sonic chain is supposed to link the Ethereum ecosystem with a layer-2 bridge. Sonic will have the ""ability to withdraw funds on Ethereum independently,"" and will generate a proof ""for every asset bridged from Ethereum to Sonic chain,"" said Michael Kong, CEO of Fantom Foundation, in an email to CoinDesk.  Sonic will be ""greatly superior in terms of speed and security compared to the Fantom chain. Over time, we anticipate that users and developers will fully migrate to the Sonic chain,"" Kong added.  According to a press release from the Fantom Foundation, Sonic Foundation will be responsible for the governance of the Sonic ecosystem as well as its treasury. Sonic Labs will focus on decentralized applications and the community for the Sonic network.  The Fantom team also shared that once the Sonic chain goes live, expected sometime this year, the network will have its own native token, $S, “which will be 1:1 compatible with Fantom’s existing $FTM token after a recent governance vote codifying the two tokens' interoperability.”  Alongside the news about the new Sonic entities, Fantom shared that it closed a $10 million funding round led by Hashed, which will go towards growing Sonic’s ecosystem and product.  Sonic Foundation and Sonic Labs will not officially start working until the Sonic chain is up and running.  “I'm incredibly grateful to our investors for their belief in our vision for Sonic and for our dedicated team for their hard work and commitment to ensuring a smooth rebranding process,” said Kong in the press release. “We will continue our legacy of efficacy, transparency, and loyalty to our community in this next stage of the protocol. ”  Read more: Fantom Seeks Money Back From Multichain’s $200M Exploit",POSITIVE,FTM,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FTM | SPONSORED,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/23/fantom-foundation-creates-sonic-foundation-labs-for-new-sonic-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f747e95bdec933c1975e4c7627498b1b49d1264c-1920x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One such startup, Plume, has raised $10 million in seed funding for what it says will be the first layer-2 blockchain purpose-built for RWAs. The round was led by Haun Ventures and included participation from Galaxy Ventures, Superscrypt, A Capital, SV Angel, Portal Ventures and Reciprocal Ventures.  Plume's Ethereum-based blockchain is pitched as a one-stop shop for easily bringing off-chain assets onto blockchains, meaning the protocol helps people navigate the morass of paperwork, custodial requirements and other legwork required to bring things like real estate, art and certain kinds of financial instruments onto blockchains.  ""The RWA industry is one of the fastest-growing verticals in crypto today but there remains a critical gap – to date there has not been a permissionless blockchain equipped with fullstack RWA infrastructure to deploy any asset class compliantly,"" the company explained in a statement shared with CoinDesk. ""The robust DeFi ecosystem on Plume enables users to do everything with RWAs – from earning yield, borrowing/lending, trading and speculating with leverage.""  Plume's underlying technology is based on Arbitrum Nitro – a framework for building layer-2 ""rollup"" chains that write transactions to Ethereum quickly and with low fees. The tech should make it simple for the chain to interoperate and swap assets across other chains in the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem – a constellation of other rollups built using the same framework.  ""When we started talking to protocols, everyone said the same thing: 'It takes us anywhere between six months, a year, a year and a half, two years to actually get this asset on-chain before we can even write a single line of code for our protocol,'"" Plume co-founder Chris Yin said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""That's just a ridiculous way to do things – it's just duplicative work across every single protocol. We say, let's standardize that.""  On Plume, ""you have a very comprehensive set of features to actually tokenize an asset – meaning setting up your entity, filing the stuff, taking custody of the assets, doing wallets, automatic set-up, cap table management, on/off-ramping, [know-your-customer] – all of those things are baked in,"" said Yin. ""We just take these products, we integrate them and put a nice UI on it and make sure that it's nicely modular.""  According to Yin, Plume currently has more than 80 projects deploying real-world assets onto its private test network. ""Everything from collectibles, private credit, real estate – all these things are deploying on Plume,"" he said.

42418085,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcZe1,1716480000,Crypto for Advisors: Bitcoin ETF vs Direct Ownership,"The arrival of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US has driven a lot of interest and inflows, especially from institutions. As client interest grows, advisors are hearing more questions from their clients about whether they should own the underlying asset directly or if ETF ownership is suitable for them. D.J. Windle, founder and portfolio manager of Windle Wealth, created the “advisors guide” to help navigate these questions.  Miguel Kudry, CEO of L1 Advisors, answers questions about ETH ETFs. Will they be the same or different?  –S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  To ETF or Not to ETF  As digital assets continue to gain traction, financial advisors are increasingly encountering questions from clients about the best ways to invest in bitcoin. Two primary options dominate the conversation: investing in a spot bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and buying bitcoin directly. This article aims to provide financial advisors with a detailed comparison of these investment vehicles, addressing key aspects such as management, custody, trading, and tax implications to inform both advisors and their clients better.  Management  Bitcoin ETF  A spot bitcoin ETF is managed by professional fund managers who handle the buying, selling and custody of bitcoin, simplifying the investment process for investors who may be unfamiliar with the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies. This professional management reduces the burden on investors but comes with management fees that can reduce overall returns over time. Additionally, investors do not have control over the underlying bitcoin, as decisions are made by the fund managers.  Direct Bitcoin Ownership  When clients buy bitcoin directly, they own the cryptocurrency outright, providing a level of control and flexibility that ETFs cannot match. Direct ownership eliminates the need for paying ongoing management fees, but investors must manage their own purchases, sales, and custody, which can be complex and time-consuming. Mismanagement can lead to significant losses, especially for inexperienced investors as managing bitcoin holdings can require specialized knowledge.  Custody and Security  Bitcoin ETF  ETFs typically utilize institutional-grade custody solutions provided by third-party custodians, which often employ advanced security measures such as cold storage and multi-signature wallets. This reduces the risk of theft and loss, but investors rely on third-party custodians, introducing counterparty risk. Advisors and their clients also do not have direct control over the custody arrangements, which can be a concern for those who prioritize control.  Direct Bitcoin Ownership  Direct bitcoin ownership requires investors to manage their own custody solutions, ranging from using digital wallets to storing private keys. This offers greater control but also increased responsibility for securing the assets. Poor security practices or lost private keys can result in irreversible loss of funds. Advisors should educate clients on best practices for protecting their Bitcoin, such as using hardware wallets and enabling two-factor authentication.  Trading and Liquidity  Bitcoin ETF  Bitcoin ETFs are traded on major stock exchanges, providing high liquidity and ease of trading during regular market hours. This regulated market offers additional investor protections. However, trading is limited to stock exchange hours, unlike the 24/7 crypto market. Markets often move a lot outside of traditional exchange hours and advisors or clients wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. Also, ETF shares may trade at a premium or discount to the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying bitcoin.  Direct Bitcoin Ownership  Bitcoin can be bought and sold on various cryptocurrency exchanges, providing access to a global market that operates 24/7. This offers high liquidity, and investors buy and sell at market prices without premiums or discounts. However, the liquidity and trading experience can vary significantly across different exchanges, and some may charge higher fees for transactions and withdrawals. For advisors, many may not want to manage client funds with a trading day that is 24/7. That puts a large responsibility to ensure you are paying attention when you may otherwise not be.  Tax Implications  Bitcoin ETF  Investing in a bitcoin ETF can have different tax implications compared to holding bitcoin directly. ETFs may offer more straightforward tax reporting, as they are treated like other securities. This can simplify tax reporting for investors, and certain ETFs may offer structures that provide tax advantages, such as deferring capital gains taxes. However, selling ETF shares may incur capital gains taxes, which can impact overall returns.  Direct Bitcoin Ownership  Holding bitcoin directly involves different tax considerations, particularly around capital gains and losses. The tax treatment can be complex and time-consuming, with specific rules on reporting and calculation. Direct ownership allows investors to manage their capital gains and losses directly, potentially optimizing their tax strategies. However, tax reporting can be complex and burdensome, requiring careful compliance and often the consultation of a tax professional and/or software to track the transactions. Advisors may need to work closely with tax professionals to ensure compliance and optimize tax outcomes.  Using Institutional Platforms  For clients seeking direct bitcoin ownership without the complexities of self-management, institutional platforms through advisors who manage crypto offer a viable alternative and potentially the best of both worlds. These platforms provide professional management, similar to ETFs, but with the added benefit of direct ownership. Holding bitcoin in many different account types, such as a Trust, IRA, and Corporate Account, can make estate and tax planning a bit easier with more flexibility in account types that are a little harder to access when owning the individual coins on a hard wallet. However, this convenience comes at a cost, as these institutions often charge cold storage fees to secure the bitcoin holdings in offline wallets, adding an extra layer of security but also increasing overall costs.  So what now?  Choosing between a spot bitcoin ETF and buying bitcoin directly involves weighing the pros and cons of each method. Financial advisors should help the client decide what is most important to them when it comes to their exposure to bitcoin. And often, it boils down to just that: exposure.  For some clients, exposure is enough, in which case the ETF may be the best option. It’s quick and easy to grab that exposure. For others, having direct ownership of these assets may be of utmost importance, in which case the advisor should help the client decide if they have the knowledge to handle self-custody or if paying for institutional custody and all its benefits is in their best interest.  - D.J. Windle, founder and portfolio manager, Windle Wealth  Ask an Expert  Q: What are some key differences between the bitcoin and ether ETFs, and how they differ from owning the underlying asset?  In both cases, owning the underlying asset enables full portability, 24/7 liquidity, and the ability to do things on Bitcoin or Ethereum crypto rails (namely global payments, Decentralized Finance, and more). However, the ETH ETF now introduces a key aspect that advisors should consider. Unlike bitcoin, ether can become a yield-bearing asset by staking it to help secure the Ethereum network. It is very unlikely that the first ETH ETFs offer any staking rewards to investors for a number of regulatory and operational reasons of the issuers. Today, owning and holding ether directly (and for that matter, any other yield-bearing digital asset) is the only way to access these staking rewards, so advisors should consider this when talking to clients about Ether. These staking rewards become income-generating opportunities that investors with considerable ETH exposure should, at the very least, consider, or at the very least, understand that they are leaving on the table if they only hold the asset in ETF form.  Q: How should advisors think about the entire spectrum of custody options?  Custody is not a one-size-fits-all solution. In TradFi, advisors typically work with more than one custodian to address their firm's and client's full needs. Digital asset custody is even more nuanced, and advisors would do well to adopt a hybrid approach to custody options. Different custody options cater to different investor profiles. Some clients may have higher exposure to digital assets than others. Some may be already self-custody and want to incorporate those into their financial planning or advisory relationship. Others may want exposure through direct ownership via a qualified custody solution. For others, spot ETFs and other publicly traded vehicles may offer enough exposure. Advisors should also be prepared to support their client’s evolving needs and interests. The price volatility and performance of digital assets usually makes investors lean in and become more educated. Oftentimes, it also makes them prone to adopt new forms of custody as their level of sophistication, risk appetite, and overall knowledge of the space increase.  Q: Unlike bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) can be staked to help secure the Ethereum network and generate income from staking rewards. Do custody options impact an investor’s ability to access such rewards?  Advisors should be aware that the custody or investment vehicle used to own or invest in ETH very much impacts an investor’s ability to generate rewards from staking or the net fees they keep in their wallets. Spot ether ETF applicants ditched all staking language from their S-1 filings, meaning that ETH ETF investors will not see any rewards from staking. Qualified custodians effectively operate as walled gardens when it comes to staking. Some offer staking solutions by running their own staking infrastructure and operating the staking programs on behalf of investors who can opt-in to stake their ETH and typically pay the custodian or the staking operator a percentage of rewards. Self-custody enables investors to access a wide range of staking solutions that can be custodial or non-custodial, depending on whether they send their ETH to a third party to be staked or they sign transactions on-chain to stake ETH or mint any of the so-called Liquid Staking Tokens.  - Miguel Kudry, CEO, L1 Advisors Inc.

42418084,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcZbx,1716479052,"No, a Sponsored Labeled Crypto Press Release Is Not An Alternative to Editorial Coverage, PR Pro Says","Press release distribution services, or newswires in short, have been a staple of the marketing industry for years, used by thousands of businesses as their go-to option for spreading the word.  Recently, crypto-focused distribution services have gained a lot of traction in the blockchain space, pitching themselves as a ""cheaper"" way for projects to gain visibility through sponsored press releases during the dark days of crypto winter, when marketing budgets were tight.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing package. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  Crypto's latest spell in the doldrums, which endured from the end of 2021 until the middle of 2023, meant that most projects didn't have the luxury of spending thousands of dollars on promoting themselves, and so the idea of a press release being syndicated to dozens of websites in a single click was attractive.  But is this shotgun-style approach really the most effective method of getting the PR and building the credibility and trust that your project so desperately needs?  Far more 'misses' than 'hits'  Anyone who knows how press release distribution actually works will understand why using them is often a bad idea.  While press release distribution services have partnered with dozens of crypto news outlets and can guarantee sponsored labeled placements on these websites, the quality and credibility of that coverage is questionable at best.  Compared to a bland list of syndicated headlines, an intriguing and personalized pitch is a million times more likely to get journalists' attention  With these services, press releases are generally just ""syndicated"", meaning that, although they will indeed be published by dozens of news sites, including crypto-focused ones, they'll often end up published in a non-editorial “backyard” section of the website that gets a lot less eyeballs. The actual content will just be a duplicated version of the original press release, with no editorial review, no analysis, no opinions or unique interpretation of what's happening. Just a sponsored labeled press release, with a regulatory requirement to disclose that it's basically just a paid ad, which generates neither the credibility or trust projects are seeking.  Here's an example of how it looks on one of the more popular crypto news sites. In this case, it's a crying shame because a $15 million funding round is actually a newsworthy story and could well have been picked up by an editorial reporter. But because it's automatically syndicated, editors will see little point in writing up a unique article when it has already been published. In my opinion, the company that chose the paid distribution route made a big mistake, but it's far from alone in making such an error. There are numerous examples of newsworthy stories in the crypto industry suffering a similar fate.  But aren't these releases also distributed to a broader pool of crypto journalists, you might ask? Surely someone will want to pick it up and cover it editorially, right?  Earned media is the way to go  If you're looking for compelling coverage of your news on a reputable site that's perceived to be trustworthy, then a direct pitch to a seasoned reporter is the way to go. When your news is covered by a real journalist, it creates a sense of authenticity, conveying the idea that your story is worth the attention of readers.  A media pitch involves communicating directly with a journalist or editor in order to convince them that you have a bona-fide story people actually want to read. The actual pitch is really just a short message that's intended to pique their interest in your news and encourage them to write about it. It can be an effective tool for experienced marketers, who understand that journalists are very busy and receive dozens of such pitches every day. As such, their pitches are generally very concise and direct, highlighting the key points of the news and explaining why it's of interest. They'll also be personalized for the specific journalist or publication in question, demonstrating why it should interest their audience.  Compared to a bland list of syndicated headlines, an intriguing and personalized pitch is a million times more likely to get journalists' attention. And because readers will know it was written by a journalist, the resulting story will create far more believable PR.  That said, it's important to realize that not every story merits a direct pitch. Self-promotional company announcements with no news hook whatsoever, such as airdrops, non-fungible token (NFT) drops, token sales and listings, probably won't interest reporters as these are barely newsworthy. So if you absolutely have to get the word out, then a press release distribution service might be worth a shot for an announcement of this kind, or take the owned media route.

28330199,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609513,1716477714,Margex Exchange Review: Copy Trading Platform Pros and Cons,"Margex is a cryptocurrency exchange platform founded in 2019 focusing primarily on derivatives trading. However, it also offers other popular features such as copy trading, staking, price alerts, an attractive referral program, and much more. Margex’s interface is designed to be intuitive, making it an excellent choice for those taking their first steps into the world of cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Although its primary focus is beginners, it is also suitable for more advanced traders who value ease of use. Margex can be accessed through its website, mobile browser, or mobile app, which is available for Android and iOS. However, it is important to note that Margex is not available in certain countries, including the United States, the Republic of Seychelles, Bermuda, Cuba, Crimea, Sevastopol, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, and Afghanistan. The exchange is an unregulated platform based in Seychelles, which means it does not require users to go through identity verification (KYC) processes. This is a plus for traders who value privacy. However, this could raise questions about the platform’s security. Despite its lack of regulation, Margex has implemented robust security measures to ensure user protection. Three Layers of Security For Unparalleled Protection User account security includes encryption of sensitive data, two-factor authentication (2FA), and email alerts for any account activity. Crucially important features like custodian security protects assets in cold storage with multiple signatures and an access segregation system. The trading infrastructure itself ensures a smooth user experience and fast order execution by protecting against DDoS attacks and other advanced measures. In addition to these measures, Margex has a system called MP Shield that uses artificial intelligence to detect and prevent suspicious activities such as fake trades or price manipulation attempts. This system protects users from dishonest behavior on the platform. High Stakes Derivatives Trading with Up to 100x Leverage The main attraction of Margex is its ability to trade perpetual futures with leverage. Perpetual contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset without expiration, allowing traders to hold their positions indefinitely. At Margex, users can trade with leverage ranging from 5x to 100x, which means they can control a much more prominent position with a relatively small investment. Margex offers more than 60 trading pairs, including the most popular ones, such as BTC/USD, ETH/USD, and others. The platform also plans to introduce stablecoin pairs and Forex pairs with leverage of up to 500x shortly. To ensure competitive pricing and minimize price slippage, Margex aggregates liquidity from more than 12 providers, which ensures that users get current and relevant prices in the market. Designed To Boost Beginner’s Performance The Margex interface is extremely intuitive, especially in its trading terminal. It consists of three main parts: the order creation interface, the trading pairs chart along with the order book and last trades, and the order and position management interface. Margex also provides a variety of educational materials to help new users understand how the platform works and trading in general. In addition, it offers the possibility to practice with demo funds through AirUSD tokens, allowing users to perform simulated trades without real risk. Another useful feature for beginners is copy trading, which allows users to replicate the trading strategies of other successful traders. Users can invest in these strategies and share the profits with the creators of the strategies, which makes it easier to learn and profit simultaneously. Powerful Profit Opportunities All Without Trading Additionally, Margex offers several ways for users to earn cryptocurrencies. Its referral program is a stand out in the industry, allowing users to earn 40% of the trading commissions of those they refer. The more referrals a user has, the more they can earn. Staking at Margex allows users to generate returns without selling or trading their assets. The platform offers up to 5% APY, and there are no lock-in periods, meaning users can withdraw their assets anytime. Finally, Margex offers several bonuses, including a $50 sign-up bonus and a $50 first deposit bonus in deposited cryptocurrency. These bonuses can be used to cover trading fees, making the Margex experience even more profitable. Maximizing ROI With Ultra Low Margex Fees Like many other platforms, Margex utilizes a maker/taker fee model. However, Margex keeps fees ultra low to maximize trader ROI. For example, makers who add liquidity to the market only pay a fee of 0.019%, while takers who withdraw liquidity from the market pay a small fee of 0.06%. These fees are some of the lowest in the cryptocurrency trading industry. In addition, funding fees apply to open positions beyond specific funding periods, which occur every 8 hours. Funding fees vary depending on the trading pair and market volatility. Similar to maker and taker fees, funding fees are typically lower than competitors.

42418077,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcZWn,1716475618,The True Value of Web3: You Can Take Your Toys and Leave,"Until recently, when users landed on the Roblox website, they were greeted with a proposition: Earn Serious Cash. It seemed straightforward enough. Sign up, create digital goods and build virtual experiences to sell to other players, and get rich. But as many millions of hopefuls have learned, it’s actually really hard to make money as a Roblox developer. So hard, in fact, that a mob of angry parents slapped the company with a class action lawsuit calling out its exploitative fee structures that prey on the platform’s player base, of which half are purportedly aged 13 or under. And while critics focus a lot on Roblox’s low payouts and high commission thresholds, the bigger problem is that creators can’t get off the platform when they’ve had enough of its shit.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. The author is a speaker at Consensus 2024.  Almost everything in Roblox exists because a player created it, and yet those creators have little to no rights to their crop. While creators do retain ownership of their user-generated content (UGC), they also grant Roblox a comprehensive, royalty-free license to use, modify, publicly perform and distribute that content globally. Even if a creator leaves, Roblox retains rights to all content created on its platform indefinitely. This limits creators' potential earnings and control over their IP, and prevents competitors from competing, since it’s impossible for Roblox creators to port their work over to a new platform.  Roblox, in short, is kind of like Hotel California. Creators can log out any time they like, but they can never really leave.  This is why Web3 people are always banging on about the importance of digital property rights. Without property rights on the internet, users become shackled to the Web2 platforms that amass them. When everything they’ve created and achieved, and even the community to which they belong, is owned by the platform, it’s not as simple as just picking up, moving on, and starting anew. In fact, the more value the creator creates on Roblox, the harder it gets for them to leave. It is a poignant example of the injustices of centralization online and the need for a more equitable internet that affords all users the right to take their shit and leave, if they want.  This has always been blockchain’s selling proposition. Be Your Own Bank, Not Your Keys/Not Your Crypto, and so on. These early slogans were highly financialized, since blockchain’s breakthrough feature was digital cash that allowed people to take self sovereign custody of their money. But the crux of the movement has always been about having ownership rights for your property online, so that you – and only you – can decide what to do with it. It started with banks, now we’re looking at internet platforms like Roblox. Be it money, personal information, or an avatar’s hat in the shape of an emoji poo, the Web3 vision is that those assets should be user-owned and controlled.  It's an abstract concept for most internet users, who have lived most of their digital lives within Web2 environments, unaware of the benefits they might enjoy if they were set free by Web3. To be fair, Web3 hasn’t been particularly good at evidencing those benefits. To date, the rhetoric has been mostly anarchic, libertarian; as if the reason that we need to take control of our digital assets is because someone or something is out to get us.  In the context of video games, Web3 advocates warn players what might happen to their beloved skin or weapon if the publisher of their favorite game bans their account or turns the game off altogether. The problem is, it’s a largely unrelatable anecdote that’s met with eyerolls by the average player. To date, we don’t have a lot of good examples to demonstrate how Web3’s openness and optionality could actually elevate the user experience beyond what we already know and love about the internet. Which is why we’ve not seen a mutiny of Roblox users demanding their digital rights.  See also: The NFT Game That Makes Cents for Filipinos During COVID  Farcaster is one example of what a decentralized social experience could look and feel like in our fabled Web3 utopia – particularly with the recent announcement that Farcaster Channels would be brought in-protocol. Previously, Channels (like subreddits on Reddit) were only available in-app on Warpcast, the most popular Farcaster client. Now, Channels will be on-chain and sovereign just like Farcaster accounts, meaning that communities built in these Channels will be owned by their creators, and not controlled by any one platform, giving them greater flexibility over ownership and economics. This move to bring UGC on-chain underscores the difference between Web2 and Web3 thinking. Web2 platforms like Roblox capture value using moats that stop users getting out. Web3 platforms like Farcaster allow users to come and go as they please, offering unprecedented autonomy, liberty and freedom for citizens of the internet.  When user switching costs are basically zero, the challenge for Web3 games like The Sandbox, Pixels and Avalon, or fully on-chain games like Downstream and Pirate Nation, is to design incentives that encourage their communities to stick around and continue reinvesting in their virtual economies of their own free will. This will require a redefinition of how to achieve competitive advantage compared to the Web2 era. Some platforms will fight against it, doing everything in their power to keep their users trapped and subservient.

A rampant U.S. dollar after a PMI report showed a red-hot U.S. economy may have accelerated the drop.  Cryptocurrency prices took a hit Thursday as market participants waited for a U.S. regulatory decision on spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds.

ETH, which surged to its highest price since mid-March to above $3,900 early Thursday, tumbled to near $3,700, but was still in the green over the past 24 hours.  The sell-off rippled through the broader digital asset market, with the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) declining over 2%. Altcoin majors dogecoin {{DOGE}}, Avalanche's native token {{AVAX}}, shiba inu {{SHIB}} and Chainlink's {{LINK}} all fell more than 4% in less than an hour, CoinDesk data shows.  While the sell-off started earlier, a fresh S&P Purchasing Managers' Index report showed a red-hot U.S economy, with output growing at the fastest pace in two years. That drove a surge in the dollar as traders tamped down interest-rate cut expectations, which might have exacerbated the drop in risk assets. The broad-market equity index S&P 500 fell 0.6% from its opening price.

42418076,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcZTh,1716474699,Gensler Says 'Stay Tuned' on U.S. SEC's Decision on ETH ETF,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler declined on Thursday to preview his agency's decision on ether {{ETH}} exchange traded funds (ETFs), though he advised observers to ""stay tuned.""  Though he'd reiterated that the court decision on ETFs had caused his agency to ""pivot"" in its thinking, when asked by CoinDesk on Thursday about what the agency is preparing to do in response to the specific applications on this much-anticipated crypto decision, he largely demurred.  Latest News: SEC Approves Spot Ether ETF Listing, Still Needs to Approve Issuers' Filings  ""I don't have anything on this particular filing,"" Gensler said outside an Investment Company Institute event in Washington.  ""We do it within the law and how the courts interpret the law, and that's what I'm deeply committed to,"" he said, after having noted on stage at the event that the agency had responded to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision rejecting the SEC's approach toward spot bitcoin {{BTC}} ETFs earlier this year.  The SEC, after weeks of limited engagement, asked exchanges supporting spot ether ETF applications to refile their 19b-4 forms with universal language earlier this week. Those forms were submitted to the SEC by Tuesday, and the exchanges began publishing them online that night. The SEC also appears to have begun engaging with the would-be issuers themselves, as companies like Fidelity and Grayscale filed updated S-1 forms this week. The SEC has to make a final decision on at least one spot ether ETF application by the end of the day Thursday.  Based on these forms, it appears the SEC is uncomfortable with the idea that ether ETF issuers might stake any assets.  Industry participants previously told CoinDesk that while the SEC's moves this week don't guarantee approval of the ETFs, they make it more likely that the ETFs will be approved.  ""[The] DC Circuit took a different view, and we took that into consideration and pivoted,"" Gensler said on Thursday.  Gensler also reiterated Thursday that his agency would keep working on its opposition to the crypto bill that passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday.  ""We'll continue to engage,"" he said. ""It's just a field where the token operators – without prejudging any one of them – aren't making the disclosures that investors really could benefit from and are required by law.""  ""We've seen leaders in this field find themselves on a pathway to jail or extradition,"" he added.  And when asked about Congress seeking to reverse his agency's crypto accounting policy, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), he argued that the agency meant it as guidance at a time when failing crypto firms were having to treat customer assets the same as their own in bankruptcy.  ""The crypto that these companies have said they took as custody actually because part of the bankruptcy estate,"" Gensler said. ""That's what we were addressing back in 2022,"" he added, saying it was ""just"" an accounting bulletin.

28328235,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609480,1716474650,"Bitcoin Expected To Peak Soon? Analyst Forecasts Timeline, Here’s When","As the cryptocurrency market continues to witness heightened optimism and confidence from investors, Crypto Con, a popular crypto analyst, and enthusiast has predicted the timeline for Bitcoin to reach its peak in the ongoing bull cycle, based on past BTC runs and their cumulative peaks. Bitcoin Peak To Happen Less Than A Year By analyzing historical data, Crypto Con has identified trends that might pinpoint the time the largest cryptocurrency asset by market reaches its highest point in this cycle. According to the expert, the Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) Ergodic Indicator shows that Bitcoin is exactly where it should be in the current bull cycle. Related Reading: Historical Trends Unveil Bitcoin Peak Timing in Current Bull Cycle At this point, Crypto Con believes there is still a lot of room for growth in the upcoming days. Thus, BTC’s current position, which is around a year from cycle peaks, places this cycle’s peak between January and February of 2025. However, December 2024 remains the analyst’s focus, which, at the current rate, is expected to be the cycle’s top month. Crypto Con further hinted at the recent recovery from a perfectly healthy correction observed in the crypto market as a potential catalyst to drive the price of Bitcoin higher. The post read: The SMI tells us that Bitcoin is right where it should be in the cycle, with much more room for growth. Our current position lines up at about 1 year from cycle tops, which would make this cycle’s top in Jan – Feb 2025. My eye is still on December 2024, a likely cycle top month at our current rate. Given that the analyst previously predicted BTC to reach $149,000 by the end of the year, it could mean the expert expects the asset to top out at the level by December. “Bitcoin is still on track for a layer 7 price target of $149,000 by the end of this year,” he stated. Crypto Con’s prediction is in line with the most precise measurements for Log Regression Curves and the cycle tops in 2021. By then, the more cautious layer 6, which is the layer that denoted the 2013 cycle top, aims to reach the $108,000 level. During the prediction, the expert highlighted a price consolidation, which is a new development in this cycle. However, as volatility decreases, this consolidation is accurate. Determining BTC’s Peak Through Fibonacci Extension Crypto Con has also utilized the Fibonacci Extensions to determine the Bitcoin price peak this cycle. According to cycle retraces highlighted in his chart, the first two cycles approached the 2.618 extension quite closely, while the last struck the 1.618 extension. Related Reading: Economist Foresees $115,000 Bitcoin Peak, Followed By Largest Crash Since 1929 On the possibility that the 1.618 point will repeat itself this cycle, BTC’s price will be at $159,128. “This is one of the many perspectives to be balanced in the basket of possibilities, and I would consider this estimate to be on the optimistic for this cycle,” he added. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is slowly gaining momentum toward $70,000, indicating a 5% increase in the past week. Its market cap is down by 0.25%, while its trading volume is down by 12% in the past 24 hours.

42418094,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcbqH,1716473700,Why Decentralized AI Is Gaining Steam,"Almost exactly one year ago, I wrote a piece for CoinDesk called 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better (or Maybe Worse). At the time, the idea of “Crypto + AI” was still a novel concept. Even fringe. To many, AI development felt adjacent — at best — to the world of Web3. To others, “Crypto + AI” felt like a cynical mix of two hype-y trends, like VC mad libs.  Flash forward one year.  Decentralized AI is arguably the hottest topic in the web3 space. Dozens of projects — maybe hundreds, it’s hard to keep track — are now racing to merge the tools of blockchain with the taming of AI. The space is booming. By the time you finish reading this article, another DePIN startup will have launched. And the architects of this movement are converging in Austin, for Consensus 2024, in CoinDesk’s inaugural “AI Summit.” (I’ll cop to some bias: I helped organize the event and I’ll be hosting on May 31.)  So why is this happening, and why does it matter?  You could argue that the stakes of decentralized AI are higher than the stakes of decentralized finance. In some ways the principles are the same. Satoshi Nakamoto was wary of centralized financial institutions that acted badly and jeopardized people’s money. As AI becomes a greater part of our lives — and that feels inevitable — it will have the power to shape how we see the world, how we interact with the world, and how we present to the world. It could shape how we think. Should this be controlled by the billionaire de jour?  Let’s look at two concrete examples, one that’s straightforward and one that’s chilling. The next frontier of Gen AI is likely the rise of AI agents, which can do things like book your flight, pay your phone bill, or invest your money in stocks. (“Hey Siri, go ahead and put $1,000 in the S&P.”)  Do we want Big Tech to control not just our data, but also what we do with it?  More chilling: It’s likely that millions of people will someday use AI chatbots — perhaps through audio or even video — as coaches or even therapists. Early versions are here now. (On my podcast AI-Curious, for example, I interviewed a longtime coach who’s working with the German Research Center to develop AI-based personal coaching. It’s coming. It’s inevitable.) Millions of people will share their inner-most thoughts, longings, fears, sexual desires, confessions and embarrassments. Do we want this sliced and diced by Zuckerberg and co.? The decentralized and privacy-preserving tech of blockchain, potentially, could give us the fruits of AI without the poison of Big Tech.  These are the stakes of decentralized AI. These are the topics covered at the AI Summit. (Or some of the topics. Others include how blockchain can help us preserve truth in an era of deepfakes, fight censorship, make “AI compute” more inclusive, fight bias, lead to AI alignment, and on and on.)  While an explosion of AI + Crypto projects have launched since 2022, some have been around for years and have been quietly building. One is Singularity NET, founded in 2017 by Ben Goertzel, a prominent AI researcher, with an early vision of building decentralized AI. “My initial vision for what became SingularityNET occurred to me in ’95 or ’96, when the internet became a thing,” Goertzel told me recently in Panama City, at an AI conference hosted by Singularity. “It seemed to me, the internet shouldn’t be centralized. The internet is a decentralized network. So why would you want to have a centralized search service?” The seeds of this idea included AI (which he has studied since the 80s), and Goertzel has the receipts: A 2001 book “Creating Internet Intelligence” that fuses all these concepts.  Goertzel will share his thoughts on how to actually pull off this vision at the AI Summit, along with other pioneers trying to hammer out the plumbing, pipes, and protocols of decentralized AI. That brings us to DePIN (or decentralized physical infrastructure networks), where communities of token-holders are incentivized to participate in building online services.  Gensyn, for example, is building a decentralized network that will let the untapped computing power from individual users (like you and me) be harnessed for the training of AI data, a la Filecoin for cloud storage. “We’re kind of running out of places to build enormous data centers,” Gensyn’s co-founder Ben Fielding told me last year, before this became a trendy topic. If Gensyn pulls this off, says Fielding, “You don’t just have one big data center. Now you have every data center on the planet.” (Fielding will also be taking the stage at the AI Summit, along with the heads of DePIN projects IoTeX and Grass.)  While many of the Web3+AI projects are infrastructure plays, there are now attempts to build decentralized GenAI models that compete directly with the OpenAIs of the world. And that gets us to another example of the crypto-meets-AI space, Erik Voorhees, a bitcoin OG who has vocally supported Morpheus (decentralized and open-sourced AI) and recently announced the launch of VeniceAI.  In a Twitter/X thread, Voorhees argued that Venice is similar to centralized chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude and even Grok, but “without all the Orwellian stuff” and that “Venice doesn’t spy on you,” “Venice doesn’t censor your conversation,” and “Venice doesn’t inject bias, safetyism, or political propaganda.” Only 10 days later he showed it in action and said, “There are no ads in Venice.ai and you get basically the same answer as MSFTCopilot.” Shots fired.  Voorhees and Venice are just some of the players in this space. There are countless more. Every day there’s a new launch or new partnerships. Just in the last few days, for example, Eternal AI announced a partnership with Filecoin, as a Twitter/X post explained that “Filecoin will provide decentralized storage for AI models, while Eternal AI, with its network of AI agents, will provide decentralized inference.”  Some of these many, many Web3/AI projects are in the earliest phases of ideation – little more than concept, capital, and chutzpah – but some have legs and are gaining traction. Take Rejuve AI (part of the SingularityNET ecosystem), which uses blockchain (and RJV token) to incentivize and reward people for sharing privacy-preserving health data, intended to create a massive) data-set that can be analyzed by AI, as well as hyper-personalized health trends and diagnoses. “We’re building the health and wellness economy for longevity around the RJV token, decentralizing and democratizing access to these advanced technologies,” says CEO Jasmine Smith. This is well past the whiteboard phase. Smith says 2,000 testers have contributed to the beta version; she expects it to launch in the App Store soon.  One reason these projects are all suddenly so prevalent? To be cynical for a moment, sure, there’s heat in the space and VCs like heat. (The return of a crypto bull market doesn’t hurt.) But another reason is that, in a sense, there are no other options. There aren’t many centralized AI players. The costs are staggering so only a handful can play at the table.  “The power concentration [of AI] is getting worse, not better,” says Nathaniel Whittemore, aka NLW, host of the AI Daily Brief and founder of BeSuperAI, who’s hosting an AI Town Hall at Consensus. “And greater concentration leads to more of a feeling of a need for decentralized approaches.”  None of this will happen overnight. In some ways, it’s all still a longshot. We need the smartest people in the space to collaborate, argue, and swap ideas and inspiration. We need an AI Summit.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIL | MARKET | AGX,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/23/why-decentralized-ai-is-gaining-steam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc8cf657e6f7825ac3dbdae65036935fd4f8de2f-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418090,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcboD,1716472662,Grassroots Policy Advocates Are Key to Seeding Crypto Innovation,"If you told me when I got into the blockchain space more than seven years ago that key pieces of sweeping market structure legislation for crypto would be brought to the floor of the House of Representatives, I wouldn’t have believed it.  Back then, crypto was a nascent technology viewed as “niche” or “off the beaten path.” As a lawyer in private practice advising software developers building innovative, cutting edge technology, I worked exclusively behind the scenes on novel legal questions for this emerging sector.  Rebecca Rettig is a speaker at this year's Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  We’re in a different world now. The concept of blockchain has greater cultural relevance than ever before, driven forward by evangelists and developers building on the margins.  Advocates see blockchain-based technology as transformative, with the ability to redefine not only how we engage in financial transactions, but also all internet-based interactions. Crypto brings the possibility of a new, decentralized internet to center stage in many ways, and global policymakers and regulators have trained their attention on what to do with this new industry like never before.  Policymakers and regulators are grappling with definitional and threshold questions of whether and how to regulate. What does it mean for a software system to be decentralized? When do potential financial risks emanate from cyber-security threats, and how do we mitigate such risks? What is necessary to ensure the overall integrity of the system?  A huge shift is underway in helping educate lawmakers on how to answer these questions. The policy arm of the industry has focused and professionalized as rapidly as the technology has developed. This may make advocacy seem esoteric and removed for those who are actually building and using the technology. But the time for builders and users to get involved in educating and working with lawmakers is now. This is more true than ever after the passage of the first market structure bill for crypto passed the House yesterday with a bipartisan vote.  As builders in this space, you have unique knowledge and insights in how this technology works and why it is an unprecedented reorientation of what the internet can look like. Grassroots efforts play an essential role in advocating for crypto and I have heard time and again from members of Congress that you’re exactly who they want to hear from. The point of advocacy is to help regulators tap knowledge workers and enthusiasts who have the information that can help craft polity.  So how can you get started? There are a couple easy ways to engage.  Find friends  A number of organizations have been established specifically to give you the tools you need to advocate most effectively. Example? Crypto Policy Bootcamp.  In October 2023, Polygon Labs, Solana Foundation and DeFi Education Fund co-hosted the first Crypto Policy Bootcamp. The event brought together founders, CEOs, VCs, and other stakeholders to engage with policy experts, political advocates, and Congressional staffers and members of Congress. Discussions centered on how to talk about the value of blockchain technology. Through the various panels and accompanying dialogue, the bootcamp produced many takeaways, including:  Policy is a doing word. Engaging in policy work means talking, advocating, explaining, teaching, and, most importantly, building relationships.  Storytelling matters. Being able to tell your story—whether as a developer or user — in a clear and straightforward way that addresses the direct impact of blockchain goes a long way.  The legislative process takes time.  Since October, we’ve hosted four additional bootcamps alongside others in the industry including Wormhole Foundation and Ledger, with the fifth coming at the end of May at Consensus. And the stage is set for one of the strongest crypto advocates in Congress, Tom Emmer, to take time out to speak to Bootcamp attendees in Austin.  These bootcamps aim to make policy work accessible to anyone by equipping those building, investing, or working in the space with the tools and resources they need to effectively advocate for the evolution of the blockchain industry, ecosystem, and community on the Hill and beyond. And it is one of many fantastic ways to get the tools to get involved; there are organizations, such as Stand With Crypto, that are dedicated to this task, bringing builders together in D.C. and beyond to advocate.  Tell YOUR story, like only you can  Speaking directly to policymakers, especially your own Congressional representatives, has an unquestionably high impact.  Even better when you can also tell your story. This can take many different forms: calling, writing letters, setting up meetings.  There are also a number of tools that aggregate stories and help educate lawmakers, which you can use to provide your own compelling testimony. Along with the community, Ihelped launch an open, interactive website, The Value Prop (TVP), which aggregates blockchain-based applications into a simple database. It showcases everything from community-built GPS and hotspot networks to tracking supply chains to online verification of digital records and information.  The effort took place over many months, with the enthusiastic community members submitting hundreds of use cases. As a result, TVP has become a mainstay of grassroots clarity for decision makers: policymakers and regulators use it as a resource.  Contributors from the crypto community like the Ethereum Foundation, Celo Foundation, and Mercy Corps Ventures, have elevated the site further. Now it features video testimonials of builders and founders discussing what they’re creating, why they’re doing it, and the impact of their work.  What The Value Prop needs now more than ever are user testimonials. These testimonials bring to life the people actually using crypto, and the positive impact it’s made on their lives.  To that end, core team members of Polygon Labs will want to hear what you have to say! At Consensus on May 30, we’ll be interviewing users who want to testify about how they use this tech, why, and what it’s made of their life.  You — the builders and the users — are the lifeblood of the industry. You’re the most important voices that can be heard on policy issues.  Start engaging.  It doesn’t have to be with trips to DC or even to your representatives office in your home state. You can engage from the busy Austin streets during Consensus, by filming a user testimony. Or any other myriad ways.  Your time is now.

42418093,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcbnB,1716471889,Jeff Kauffman: Decentralized Social Will Revolutionize Marketing,"Through each stepchange in technology, marketing has continually evolved. What started in the early days of Mesopotamia and Egypt, with merchants advertising their goods using symbols and signs on stalls, has become a complex global industry, constantly adapting to communications innovation.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.  When it comes to Web3, the latest innovation, Jeff Kauffman knows his stuff. Starting out early in the days of Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, Kauffman built brand communities for clients like GameStop, Dr. Pepper and Chick-fil-A. He later founded JUMP, a network for branding executives curious about Web 3, which has drawn brand managers from at least 200 Fortune 500 companies.  “With Web3, you now have this on-chain touchpoint relationship and experience and that’s the biggest difference, that there is this on-chain element to the end-user customer experience.”  Kauffman, a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, believes the future direction of marketing lies in Web 3.0 social platforms, like Farcaster and portable social graphs, which offer unique experiences and put more control back into users' hands.  “Take a look at what happened with the Starbucks loyalty program,” Jeff said. “While I commend the brand and the team for the effort, ultimately, they decided to shut it down. What did they get wrong? They tried to copy/paste their Web2 program and do it in a Web3 way. They tried to make it Web3, but it just didn't work.  “Web2 is the best way to run that loyalty program. If you're going to enter Web3 and use tokens and start to interact with customers on-chain, whether it's under the umbrella of loyalty or not, you must think about a net-new experience with your customers.”""  In a recent interview, Kauffman covered how marketing is changing with Web3, where it might go next, some examples of brands pushing the envelope and what makes for good marketing strategies with brands and creators.  The following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.  Can you give me some examples of brands utilizing this offline to online to on-chain framework and pushing the envelope?  Kauffman: Two brands that are doing well are Coinbase and 9dcc, a fashion brand started by G-Money. 9dcc is a good example of a brand that truly understands this offline, online, and on-chain brand experience and customer experience. But I'll start with Coinbase. They've done this cool thing as a publicly traded company where they've released their earnings report as an NFT collectible for free. Anyone can mint it, and then those who did receive discounts to their merch store, and get exclusive perks, for example, access to limited edition hats that are only available to people who minted their earnings report.  This shows the connection between offline, online, and on-chain. The offline component is the merchandise (the physical goods), the online component is the shopping experience of buying or securing the goods, and the on-chain element is minting their earnings report on-chain. And with the on-chain element, what's key is that brands are putting their story on-chain.  What enabled this?  Kauffman: When Web3 became a term in 2020-2021, it was kind of all about, ""Hey, we've got this collectible, and we want people to collect this thing, and we want you to buy it, and there's a limited supply."" Now, the transition is less about this exclusive collectible and more about all these little components that make up a brand story, everything from an earnings report to the goods you produce. And the primary driver of this is Layer-2 blockchains.  A few years ago, this kind of on-chain marketing and relationship with customers wasn't possible because everything was on Layer-1 Ethereum, gas costs were expensive, and they only got more expensive. This was the era of the 10,000 PFP collections in NFTs. The costs were such that you couldn't have a million or half a million people mint your earnings report; that just wasn't feasible. Having 500,000 to 1 million people engage with you on-chain only made sense when L2s came around- Base being one of the best examples of an L2 lowering transaction costs and allowing more opportunities for on-chain engagement.  Why is being on-chain so important for brands to utilize?  Kauffman: The most important aspect of on-chain marketing for brands is that it gives them a direct relationship with their customers. For consumers, they have more control of the relationship because they hold and control the tokens in their wallet.  This gives brands the ability to engage their customers within any on-chain enabled experience because the token is the link in the relationship. A couple of years ago this was more theory than reality. But, now with the rise of Web3 social, we’re seeing this play out in realtime. We’re not far from the day when an on-chain user experience on the internet is much better than the user experience with today’s internet. Cheaper fees and faster transaction costs on L2s are making this possible, which is driving new product and user experience designs that are only possible with the interoperability and composability of on-chain experiences.  I also wanted to ask, through your work with JUMP, what do you see the ad executives often get wrong or misunderstand about Web3?  Kauffman: Many of the marketers in these institutions are intelligent and capable and understand a lot about the space. But they're in handcuffs because these legacy brands and institutions were built around different marketing laws of physics. In Web3, there's a different level of physics within the ecosystems, and legacy institutions can't get out of their own way.  That makes a lot of sense, so instead of taking a cookie-cutter copy/paste approach, it needs to be more conscious and intentional?  Kauffman: A critical question to ask is “What do we do in Web3 that we couldn't do in Web2?” And it goes back to the other question, “Why blockchain?” If you keep pushing through a hundred of those scenarios, keep asking ""why blockchain"", and realize that you don't need blockchain or Web3 to do it, well, now you've just iteratively gone through all of the ideas that you shouldn't have launched in the first place as a Web3 initiative. You eventually get to the thing where you're like, ""Ah, this can only be done with blockchain. Now, we can definitively answer the question, why blockchain and why Web3.”  Let's circle back to Web3 social and how it's influencing the future of marketing.  Kauffman: Yeah, absolutely. So, the most dominant player right now is Farcaster. But Zora is very close and exciting, and then you have Lens. But if you could only spend your time in one place, it's Farcaster. So what's happening here is that this Web3 social network and Web3 social in general is bringing users and content on-chain. At a high level, other apps, experiences, and brands can then tap into the social graph facilitated through Farcaster and the content on these social networks to build new experiences.  Can you give me an example of that?  Kauffman: We can use Paragraph, which is a Web3 Substack. If you have a Farcaster account and you're active and you go to Paragraph and you create your Web3 substack or blog, you'll immediately be shown your farcaster social graph, and everyone you follow on Farcaster, their paragraph accounts will be shown to you and you can subscribe and follow them. This is something we thought would happen in Web2, but, because of the walled-garden nature and because of the privacy component, because users didn't own their content and identity in these social graphs, it became difficult to make this interoperable, portable social graph, of just network connections and people connections and the content itself as well.  Because you own your Farcaster ID, that sits in your wallet along with the content you produce, now it becomes portable. Now other brands and apps can launch and tap into that social graph and content graph. And immediately pull that in, which immediately creates this element of social graphs moving around the internet together in and out these different apps and continually being connected.  So, everytime I go to use a new app that is tapping into this Web3 social protocol, everytime I go to use a new app, that app has much more utility because I am immediately able to find the other people in my Farcaster social graph who are using this app and look at what they're doing on this new app that is tapping into what Farcaster has built.  Give us a sense of the future.  Kauffman: Let's go to 2030. Elon Musk is landing on Mars, and there's this big ephemeral moment. You have hundreds of millions of people using Web3 social media, and you could, in theory, have an app that springs up that's really tailored to that moment, as well as content consumption and the conversation that is going on at that moment. A billion people use the app, and the moment the app goes away, the app goes away.  So, Web3 social, from a marketer's perspective, is the one area if you were to ask, ""Where I am going to spend my time as a marketer,"" I would say that I am going to spend my time with Web3 social. Spend your time there, use these protocols and Web3 social platforms, and join the communities there. The ROI for your exploration and time investment is a good bet.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Mason Marcobello,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/23/jeff-kauffman-decentralized-social-will-revolutionize-marketing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ab5073236de30cb96e1bcb53627ad44363fbfc5-400x400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418107,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcc4j,1716471180,Demystifying AI’s Black Box: Ariana Spring and Andrew Stanco on How Blockchain Tech Can Shine a Light on Hidden Inputs,"Part of the magic of Generative AI is that most people have no idea how it works. At a certain level, it’s even fair to say that no one is entirely sure how it works, as the inner-workings of ChatGPT can leave the brightest scientists stumped. It’s a black box. We’re not entirely sure how it’s trained, which data produces which outcomes, and what IP is being trampled in the process. This is both part of the magic and part of what’s terrifying.  Ariana Spring is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  What if there was a way to peer inside the black box, allowing a clear visualization of how AI is governed and trained and produced? This is the goal — or one of the goals — of EQTY Lab, which conducts research and creates tools to make AI models more transparent and collaborative. EQTY Lab’s Lineage Explorer, for example, gives a real-time view of how the model is built.  All of these tools are meant as a check against opacity and centralization. “If you don’t understand why an AI is making the decisions it's making or who's responsible, it's really hard to interrogate why harmful things are being spewed,” says Ariana Spring, Head of Research at EQTY Lab. “So I think centralization — and keeping those secrets in black boxes — is really dangerous.”  Joined by her colleague Andrew Stanco (head of finance), Spring shares how crypto can create more transparent AI, how these tools are already being deployed in service of climate change science, and why these open-sourced models can be more inclusive and representative of humanity at large.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What’s the vision and goal of EQTY Lab?  Ariana Spring: We're pioneering new solutions to build trust and innovation in AI. And generative AI is kind of the hot topic right now, and that's the most emergent property, so that's something that we're focused on.  But also we look at all different kinds of AI and data management. And really trust and innovation are where we lean into. We do that by using advanced cryptography to make models more transparent, but also collaborative. We see transparency and collaboration as two sides of the same coin of creating smarter and safer AI.  Can you talk a little more about how crypto fits into this? Because you see many people saying that “Crypto and AI are a great fit,” but often the rationale stops at a very high level.  Andrew Stanco: I think the intersection of AI and crypto is one that's an open question, right? One thing we’ve found is that the hidden secret about AI is that it’s collaborative; it has a multitude of stakeholders. No one data scientist could make an AI model. They can train it, they can fine-tune it, but cryptography becomes a way of doing something and then having a tamper-proof way of verifying that it happened.  So, in a process as complex as AI training, having those tamper-proof and verifiable attestations — both during the training and afterwards — really helps. It creates trust and visibility.  Ariana Spring: What we do is that at each step of the AI life cycle and training process, there’s a notarization — or a stamp — of what happened. This is the decentralized ID, or identifier, that’s associated with the agent or human or machine that’s taking that action. You have the timestamp. And with our Lineage Explorer, you can see that everything we do is registered automatically using cryptography.  And then we use smart contracts in our governance products. So if X parameter is met or not met, a certain action can proceed or not proceed. One of the tools that we have is a Governance Studio, and that basically programs how you can train an AI or how you can manage your AI life-cycle, and that is then reflected downstream.  Can you clarify a bit what type of tools you’re building? For example, are you building tools and doing research that’s meant to help other startups build training models, or are you building training models yourselves? In other words, what exactly is the role of EQTY Labs in this environment?  Andrew Stanco: It’s a mix, in a way, because our focus is on the enterprise, since that’s going to be one of the first big places where you need to get AI correct from a training and governance standpoint. If you dig into that, then we need to have an area where a developer—or someone in that organization— can annotate the code and say, “Okay, this is what happened,” and then create a record. It’s enterprise-focused, with an emphasis on working with developers and the people building and deploying the models.  Ariana Spring: And we’ve worked on training the model as well through the Endowment for Climate Intelligence. We helped train a model called ClimateGPT, which is a climate-specific large language model. That isn’t our bread and butter, but we’ve gone through the process and used our suite of technologies to visualize that process. So we understand what it’s like.  What excites you the most about AI, and what terrifies you the most about AI?  Andrew Stanco: I mean, for excitement, that first moment when you interact with generative AI felt like you uncorked the lightning in the model. The first time you create a prompt in MidJourney, or that you asked ChatGPT a question, no one had to convince you that maybe that it’s powerful. And I didn't think there were many new things anymore, right?  And as for terror?  Andrew Stanco: I think this is a concern that maybe is the subtext for a lot of what's going to be at Consensus, just from peeking at the agenda. The concern is that these tools are letting the existing winners dig deeper modes. That this is not necessarily a disruptive technology, but an entrenching one.  And Ariana, your main AI excitement and terror?  Ariana Spring: I’ll start with my fear because I was going to say something similar. I'd say centralization. We’ve seen the harms of centralization when paired with a lack of transparency around how something works. We've seen this over the past 10, 15 years with social media, for example. And if you don’t understand why an AI is making the decisions it's making or who's responsible, it's really hard to interrogate why harmful things are being spewed. So I think centralization — and keeping those secrets in black boxes — is really dangerous.  How about excitement?  What I'm most excited about is bringing more folks in. We've had the chance to work with several different kinds of stakeholder groups as we were training ClimateGPT, such as indigenous elder groups or low income, urban, Black and brown youth, or students in the Middle East. We’re working with all these climate activists and academics to kind of say, “Hey, do you want to help make this model better?”  People are really excited, but maybe they didn't understand how it worked. Once we taught them how it worked and how they could help, you could see them say, “Oh, this is good.” They gain confidence. Then they want to contribute more. So I'm really excited, especially through the work that we're doing at EQTY Research, to begin publishing some of those frameworks, so we don’t have to rely on systems that maybe aren’t that representative.

42418104,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcc0b,1716470635,"Without Wallet Awareness, We’re Just Building Another Web2","Web3 has fallen short. The sites and apps we’ve built lack the personalization and richness that Web3 is uniquely positioned to deliver. While Web3 has achieved fundamental innovations like decentralization, sovereignty, and enhanced privacy, navigating this decentralized ecosystem still feels almost identical to Web2.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.  Wallet awareness is key to creating a digital adventure that is not only enhanced but also distinct from Web2. It’s about leveraging the rich pseudonymous information in our wallets to craft unique interactions. Unfortunately, wallet awareness is still conspicuously absent from Web3, leaving a gap in the potential for a truly immersive and personalized digital journey.  Right now, wallets set Web3 apart but function like traditional log-ins. You connect, sign a transaction, and access content, but the site doesn't react to the rich information your wallet holds. This limits wallets to mere access points without enhancing the digital experience.  This absence of “wallet awareness” is glaring. True Web3 content should react to wallet data, creating dynamic and personalized interactions. In Web2, some sites already offer tailored experiences based on user data. Web3 should go even further by using wallet information to deliver curated content, targeted recommendations, personalized growth marketing, and actionable insights by default.  Wallets hold vast pseudonymous data reflecting our interests and desires. Wallet awareness leverages this to offer a highly personalized digital journey. It’s the innovation that will truly set Web3 apart from Web2. And on-chain growth marketing will be one of the areas with the most nearterm adoption.  Wallet awareness is rudimentary  Despite its potential, wallet-aware Web3 interactions remain sparse.  It’s most common in the DeFi landscape, where we frequently connect wallets to interact with apps. However, personalized recommendations are rare. DeFi apps are highly transactional, limiting wallets to mere access points instead of gateways to rich, personalized journeys.  A bigger issue is that wallet awareness, even in its basic form, is absent where it should be most prevalent. Outside of DeFi apps, crypto seems to lack wallet awareness at a massive scale. Users can go through an entire decision-making funnel — from discovering a project to investing and staking its asset — without encountering it once. Wallet-aware experiences are buried in community portals, where we once again only leverage wallets to transact briefly to be assigned a role or placed into a channel.  The places in crypto where wallet awareness could shine are conspicuously lacking it. Imagine visiting a series of crypto research sites, connecting your wallet on each one, and seeing a 'for you' page with publications relevant to your holdings everywhere you browsed. This should be the norm.  Achieving full wallet awareness requires a new approach to building Web3. Apps like Warpcast (Farcaster) and growth marketing tools like Spindl, Serotonin (my company), and Addressable are starting to show what’s possible, but there’s still a lot of work to be done. Wallet awareness is an aspiration, but it’s one we as Web3 builders must commit to if we want to create a truly unique internet.  To transcend the limitations and invasive practices of Web2 and harness the potential of decentralized technology, we must prioritize wallet awareness. By doing so, we can create a more personalized, dynamic, and engaging Web3 that stands apart from the past and paves the way for a brighter digital future.  The Path Forward  I believe Web3's success hinges on more than just decentralization and enhanced privacy. To truly differentiate it from Web2, we must embrace wallet awareness. This means building an internet where digital experiences are tailored to the individual, leveraging the rich data within our wallets to create something uniquely Web3.  Imagine a Web where every interaction feels personalized, where content is curated just for you based on the pseudonymous data in your wallet. This is not a distant dream but an achievable goal right now. A wallet aware Web3 can transform the way we engage with the digital world, making it more meaningful and tailored to each user’s needs and preferences.  The effects of wallet awareness reach further than just on-site experience, and into how you acquire users. Onchain marketing can use wallet awareness to deliver personalized advertising based on wallet activity. This approach respects user privacy by using pseudonymous data and does not pry into the personal background of the user. With wallet data, on-chain marketing can create an advertiser-user relationship built on respect and utility, offering relevant and useful ads tailored to the user's interests and holdings. This creates a more engaging and meaningful marketing experience, far removed from the intrusive practices of Web2.  As builders and innovators in the Web3 space, it’s our responsibility to push the boundaries and strive for more than just incremental improvements. We need to create a Web that is not just decentralized but also deeply personalized and responsive to its users.  The path towards a fully realized Web3 is ongoing, and wallet awareness is a crucial step in that journey.

42418108,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcc2f,1716470575,‘Innovation Continues to Occur in Siloes’: DTCC Digital Head Nadine Chakar on Responsible Blockchain Building,"Nadine Chakar is often called one the most powerful women in finance. As global head of the digital asset wing at DTCC, which settles an astronomical amount of transactions annually (in the quadrillions), she has a front row seat to how technology is reinventing finance before our very eyes. Which might be why she’s become such a staunch advocate for blockchain-based innovations.  Nadine Chakar is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  “With tokenization, firms could be more capital-efficient, create new business models and more easily expand product offerings and distribution channels. Firms could unlock new efficiencies and uncover ways to streamline existing processes while finding new markets and ways of unlocking liquidity – and they can likely do it cheaper and faster,” Chakar wrote in a CoinDesk op-ed.  Chakar, who has over 30 years of experience of global wealth and asset management experience, has essentially charted her own path through the world of finance. Before DTCC (which acquired her compliance-focused tokenization firm Securrency in 2023), Chakar served as an executive vice president at State Street, where she essentially built out the State Street Digital unit after a stint as executive vice president of the firm’s global markets division.  “This blend of experience between the traditional and the startup worlds has helped me, as a leader, to better understand how to strike the right balance between agile and responsible innovation,” Chakar said in an interview.  See also: What Consensus Speakers Are Looking Forward to This Year  CoinDesk caught up with Chakar to discuss her career history, how she views digital transformation and what responsible regulation for crypto would look like.  To what extent did your career at places like State Street Digital and BNY Mellon prepare you to lead the digital asset business at DTCC?  I have a history of working at heavily-regulated financial institutions, which has given me expertise leading teams that can innovate in a responsible, transparent way that meets the highest regulatory standards. However, given my time as CEO of Securrency, I’ve witnessed the power of a fintech that can innovate quickly. This blend of experience between the traditional and the startup worlds has helped me, as a leader, to better understand how to strike the right balance between agile and responsible innovation.  Now that Securrency has become DTCC Digital Assets, I believe we’re leveraging the best of both worlds. We combine DTCC’s legacy of trust and experience as the infrastructure for the world’s largest capital markets with Securrency best-in-class technology capabilities.  Are you observing digital assets impacting traditional financial markets?  I believe digital assets are largely operating in a different universe from traditional markets. However, I think we’re at a turning point where the two are starting to converge. A major challenge is that innovation continues to occur in siloes, where financial institutions will team up with a fintech [company] to launch a pilot, only to culminate with a press release and then fizzle out afterward.  We’re calling for a change in approach: we should focus on large-scale pilots with many participants and have experiments build upon each other incrementally to begin building a larger, interoperable digital asset ecosystem that can power digital markets.  It's often said that market structure for digital assets needs reform: Do you have ideas of what this should look like?  We require an ecosystem for digital assets that’s worthy of the one we have for traditional assets today. First and foremost, we need infrastructure that can connect traditional systems with the digital ecosystem and that provides the same level of soundness and safety of existing offerings. Second, we must ensure we’re facilitating how assets and processes can move across multiple blockchains.  Third, we must have a clear legal and regulatory framework to establish controls and standards. This is essential, and it should include standards for data, including its use and collection, methods to protect private data and establishing exactly what data is allowed on-chain.  See also: A Crypto Developer's Guide to Consensus 2024  Of course, DTCC has been bringing this sort of expertise to the markets for over 50 years. We have the established ecosystem for traditional securities, which will serve as the foundation for creating the digital infrastructure of the future. We are also here to help guide the evolution of the regulatory framework over time to support digital assets.  We can’t do it alone. This is why we’ve partnered with other financial market infrastructures, Euroclear and Clearstream, to issue a new paper that lays out the path forward for developing this ecosystem in a measured and collaborative way. We’re excited to announce the paper at Consensus.  What are you most looking forward to at Consensus?  Networking and connecting with colleagues. It’s worth repeating: the path to creating the digital asset ecosystem starts with collaboration. While there will always be room for firms to compete with their own bright ideas and compelling use cases, we won’t make meaningful progress on tokenization without working together. I’m excited for the industry to collaborate to bring a robust, interoperable digital asset ecosystem to life.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/05/23/innovation-continues-to-occur-in-siloes-dtcc-digital-head-nadine-chakar-on-responsible-blockchain-building,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe887422a56a14520fca8dfc5c7e9a5a65cdb0bf-3104x1776.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Investors may be interested in the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF as a way to gain long-term exposure to equities benefiting from crypto price increases. In my view, the fund may be too reliant on Bitcoin mining stocks - which I view as generally poor long-term investments. To this point, cryptocurrency returns in 2024 have been of the vertical variety. Year to date, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) have each rallied by 65%. Some of the altcoins have enjoyed even stronger rallies. When the coins move like this, speculators often try to get exposure through the equity market. Many companies tied to cryptocurrencies have indeed enjoyed magnificent returns in recent weeks and months. However, this year, we've seen a divergence in performance between Bitcoin and some of the more notable Bitcoin-proxy companies - the miners. Data by YCharts Expressed through the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ), the miners are actually down over 3% year to date while BTC's surge higher has barely skipped a beat. This divergence perfectly shows the issue with longing miners as primary Bitcoin exposure vectors. I've been bullish some of the Bitcoin miners over the last 12-18 months and have expressed that view via Seeking Alpha through several dozen articles covering the leading names in the space. That said, miners have a fundamental long-term issue in their business model that I've detailed many times in the past and recently in my WGMI article from March 1st, 2024 . Every four years, the miner block reward subsidy is coded to decline by 50% virtually overnight: In the past, this shortfall in BTC-denominated rewards has generally been alleviated by the market repricing BTC much higher through the supply crunch that comes with less BTC available to be mined. However, when the mania for BTC wears off, prices fall back down and dollar-denominated miner revenue falls with it. Thus, it is possible for Bitcoin to rally while miners decline, and we've seen that exact scenario play out this year. Given this, investors may be wondering how they can get long-term exposure to the equities that benefit from Bitcoin price increases. In this article, we'll look at the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ), compare it to comps, and assess the ETF holdings. Fund Objective & Details In my view, the Crypto Industry Innovators Fund from Bitwise is a viable concept. Per Bitwise: BITQ offers exposure to the fast-growing crypto economy in a traditional ETF. The Fund holds a portfolio of “picks and shovels” companies that are building out the core infrastructure that lets crypto thrive, including bitcoin miners, crypto brokerages, and more. The way the company ascertains whether an equity should be included in the fund is straightforward. According to the Summary Prospectus , Bitwise breaks the index companies into two tiers. The first requires that companies included either derive 75% of their revenue directly from crypto activity or have more than 75% of their net assets made up of direct holdings in liquid cryptocurrencies. Given this, companies like Coinbase ( COIN ) and MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) would each be considered Tier 1 even though they have very different businesses. Tier 2 companies are ones that have at least a $10 billion market capitalization and either a significant dedicated crypto business segment or hold at least $100 million in digital assets on the balance sheet. Under this criteria, companies like PayPal ( PYPL ) and Block ( SQ ) can also be included in BITQ. Tier 1 companies make up 85% of the index, with the remaining 15% going to Tier 2. Details BITQ Fund Inception May 2021 AUM $130 million Number of Holdings 30 Expense Ratio 0.85% TTM Yield 1.44% Source: Bitwise Investments, Seeking Alpha Overall Performance Data by YCharts BITQ's performance has been poor. In addition to a negative total return of 45% since inception, the fund has lagged the S&P, the Qs, and both Bitcoin and Ethereum; most of which are up between 20-50% over the same time period. Compared to more similar products, BITQ's performance is slightly better: Data by YCharts Since inception, BITQ is ahead of The VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ). However, both of those funds are trailing the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF ( FDIG ) since the inception of FDIG in April 2022, which is represented by the chart above. BITQ DAPP FDIG Number of Holdings 30 22 47 Assets in Top 10 62.2% 62.6% 59.4% Turnover 63.0% 57.0% 55.0% Source: Bitwise Investments, Seeking Alpha Comparing holding figures and turnover ratios, the funds are fairly similar. BITQ and DAPP have nearly identical weighting to Top 10 holdings and fairly close turnover numbers though BITQ is slightly more actively managed. Given these figures and the relative proximity to FDIG, the holdings themselves require some comparison. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all three of these funds have exposure to mining companies like Marathon Digital ( MARA ) and CleanSpark ( CLSK ): BITQ DAPP FDIG Top Holding MicroStrategy MicroStrategy Coinbase Second Holding Coinbase Block Inc Marathon Digital Third Holding Marathon Digital Coinbase CleanSpark Top 3 Weight 34.7% 23.3% 33.8% Miner % of Top 3 8.1% 0.0% 18.3% Miner % of Top 10 28.5% 34.0% 44.1% Source: Seeking Alpha, Author's calculations My general read on this is that all of these funds have relatively high reliance on Bitcoin mining stocks and mining stocks have simply performed better since the inception of FDIG than they have since the inception of FDIG. Consider, the performance of top miners over the last year compared with how they've done over the last 3 years: Miner Comps (Seeking Alpha) As I alluded in the opening of this article, Bitcoin miners have the long-term headwind of declining block rewards over time. I won't belabor the point about transaction fees and their importance to the long term incentive structure of Bitcoin mining, but we're far away from viability, and I'll just leave it at that. Something else that crossed my mind when looking at the full list of BITQ holdings were some notable companies that aren't included in the index. For instance, Bakkt Holdings ( BKKT ), Bitcoin Depot ( BTM ), and Ether Capital ( ETHC:CA ) appear to qualify for fund inclusion as Tier 1 companies and none of them are in the fund as of May 21st, 2024. Furthermore, Robinhood ( HOOD ) seems to qualify as a Tier 2 company and is also notably missing from the fund's holdings at present time. I'm not saying that I'm convinced any of those companies I just mentioned are necessarily great long-term investments from where I sit, but they presumably aren't any less risky than Bitcoin mining stocks long term. Closing Summary I've covered some of the ETFs available from Bitwise Investments in the past. In my view, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) is one of the better US spot ETF offerings in the market and the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF ( OTC:BITW ) is superior as a long-term investment to a similar offering from Grayscale. On the other hand, I've been less enthusiastic with the way the Bitwise Web3 ETF ( BWEB ) has been constructed. Bitwise's breadth of crypto-adjacent ETF products is impressive. But I feel BITQ is a bit closer to BWEB from a construction standpoint. I like the idea of a broad crypto innovation ETF that focuses primarily on companies rather than the network assets themselves, but I think BITQ is a bit too reliant on Bitcoin mining stocks than would be otherwise expected. Frankly, there could be an uncomfortable signal there; that several companies that appear to quality for the fund inclusion aren't included because they may not be great long-term businesses. I've listed a few such companies in the prior section. The more charitable explanation is that we're simply too early in this industry to justify dozens of different holdings, and investors would do better picking individual names. I'm going to stick with the latter. But either way, I'm not going to call BITQ a buy.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4695235-bitwise-crypto-industry-innovators-etf-miner-concentration-problem?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28324800.jpeg

Bitcoin Price Eyes Repeat Performance, Could Hit $140,000 By August – Analyst","Recent bitcoin analysis and predictions from leading experts shed light on the potential trajectory of the top crypto asset’s price in the coming months, with a focus on 2024 and beyond. Related Reading: Tiny Pepe, Big Dreams: Memecoin Explodes, Eyes Dominance In The Dog House Market Insights And Price Forecasts For Bitcoin As the crypto community eagerly anticipates the future of Bitcoin, a diverse range of price predictions has emerged. Notable figures such as Arthur Hayes, Messari, Tim Draper, JP Morgan, Berenberg, and VanEck have weighed in with their forecasts, painting a varied picture of what lies ahead for the pioneering cryptocurrency. While some experts project conservative estimates, suggesting a price range of around $45,000, others are more bullish, envisioning BTC soaring to over $600,000 by 2024. These forecasts are underpinned by a nuanced understanding of market dynamics, including factors such as institutional interest, regulatory developments, and the impact of halving events on Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics. Historical Analysis And Market Cycle Patterns Drawing insights from historical data and market cycle patterns, analysts have identified intriguing parallels that could signal significant upside potential for Bitcoin. Previous market cycles have shown that after surpassing key all-time highs, Bitcoin prices have the propensity to double within a relatively short timeframe. The analysis of past cycles, particularly the peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021, suggests a pattern of rapid price appreciation following the breach of previous price records. If history is any indication, Bitcoin could be poised for a substantial move upwards, with projections indicating a potential doubling in price to around $140,000 in the near future. Expert Opinions And Market Sentiment Amidst the flurry of price predictions and market analyses, experts and analysts continue to offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency markets. Notable figures such as Alphanalysis and Will Woo have shared their perspectives on Bitcoin’s price trajectory, highlighting the importance of market corrections, accumulation phases, and the gradual build-up towards new all-time highs. In 2017 the price of Bitcoin doubled in just 4 weeks after it established brand new all time highs. In 2021 the price of Bitcoin doubled in just 4 weeks after it established brand new all time highs. In 2024 the same action would imply a $138,000 price by the end of June.🚀🌛 pic.twitter.com/4kOBPa6y11 — alphanalysis.io (@Sawcruhteez) May 22, 2024 Related Reading: Next Big Move For Bitcoin: Analysts Predict A Potential Breakout At $71,500 While everyone was freaking out that #Bitcoin price was not rising the last 2 months, available BTC was quietly being scooped up, and importantly without paper BTC printed in its place.

This technical indicator indicates that the present mood is bullish, and the Fear & Greed Index is reading 76, which indicates extreme greed. Over the previous 30 days, Bitcoin’s price fluctuated by 4.47%, with 12 out of 30 (or 40%) green days. The Bitcoin forecast indicates that this is a favorable moment to purchase Bitcoin. Latest data shows that there is a bullish general mood on Bitcoin price prediction, with 84% technical analysis indicators indicating optimistic signs and 16% indicating negative signals.

It plans to make Ireland its European headquarters and secure a license as a Crypto Asset Service Provider.  The Irish subsidiary of U.K.-based crypto infrastructure firm Ramp Network has secured a virtual asset services providers (VASP) registration in Ireland, the company said in a press release on Thursday.  The Ramp Network is a financial technology company building payment rails connecting crypto to the global financial system. This registration will enable its users to exchange fiat currencies for more than 100 crypto assets.  The company wants to make Ireland its European headquarters and has established a team and operation in Dublin. It intends to get authorized as a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) under the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA).  To become a licensed CASP under MiCA—the European Union’s bespoke rules for crypto—a company needs to have a registered office in an EU member state where it carries out some of its business and has a resident director.  Many crypto companies like crypto exchange Coinbase have secured a license in Ireland. In October, Coinbase said that it wanted Ireland to be its EU hub because it has a supportive environment for fintech companies.

Among ETFs, Grayscale’s GBTC holds the largest amount of bitcoin with over $20 billion, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT at $19.6 billion, while Hashdex Bitcoin ETF is the smallest holder with $12 million.  U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds now hold a record 850,707 BTC in custody, beating a previous high above 845,000 from early April.  Among those funds, Grayscale’s GBTC remains the biggest holder of bitcoin with 289,300 tokens worth more than $20 billion, followed closely by BlackRock’s IBIT at 283,200 and $19.6 billion, according to data tracked by @HODL15Capital.  The spot ETFs ended Wednesday with their eighth straight day of net inflows, gobbling over 24,500 BTC over that period. This is a nearly 180-degree turn from the action of the past few weeks – with some of the biggest ETFs seeing zero inflows and even net outflows on some days.  A shift in sentiment  The crypto industry recorded its biggest-ever U.S. policy win on Wednesday when the House of Representatives approved a wide-reaching bill to establish regulations for digital assets markets, recording a 279-136 vote that saw Democrats crossing party lines to support it.  The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) marks the first time a major crypto bill has cleared one of Congress's chambers.  Elsewhere, bulls widely expect a spot ether ETF to be approved this week in the U.S. in a sudden policy shift that saw some analysts raise approval odds to over 75% from an earlier 25%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/23/us-bitcoin-etf-holdings-hit-new-high-of-more-than-850k-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f85091350b16d4fe9ac59242d1ee85199a0f5b7-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418109,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcc5l,1716465660,"First Mover Americas: BTC, ETH Consolidate Ahead of Ether ETF Decision","This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) consolidated recent gains early this morning ahead of the SEC's decision on VanEck's spot ETH ETF application later today. BTC is little changed, down about 0.8% in the last 24 hours at $69,600, while ETH has risen nearly 2.75% to over $3,800. The wider digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) is down just over 0.5%. The general outlook for the two largest cryptocurrencies remains bullish. BTC and ETH options on derivatives exchange Deribit continue to reveal a bias for calls, or contracts that allow traders to profit from price rises, according to data tracked by Amberdata.  BlackRock, Grayscale, and Bitwise filed amended 19b-4 forms with the SEC for their proposed spot ether ETFs, removing the staking provisions some commentators said were causing regulatory roadblocks. Staking is the process of locking specific cryptocurrencies for a set period to help support the operation of a blockchain for a reward. These rewards are considered mainly passive income among crypto traders. All ether ETF hopefuls have now filed their amended proposals ahead of an approval or disapproval decision expected today. Fidelity filed earlier this week, with VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Invesco Galaxy and ARK 21Shares following suit. Hashdex is the only issuer yet to file an amendment to its Ethereum ETF.  Shares in Nvidia reached a record high during Wednesday's post-market hours after the company beat analyst estimates to report record revenue of $26.04 billion for the first quarter. The rally might be a positive signal for cryptocurrencies, including tokens supposedly associated with AI technology. This is because, historically, the inflow of money into the crypto market and the so-called AI coins has been partly contingent on outsized gains in NVDA and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index. Top AI coins such as FET, ICP, RNDR and GRT traded mixed, having rallied in the lead-up to the NVDA announcement, according to data by CoinGecko.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows SOL's seven-day put options on Deribit are again trading at a premium relative to calls.  Investors seem to be preparing for a decline in prices in case the U.S. SEC rejects spot ether applications this week.  A put option provides insurance against price drops.

This has come to a head as the non-empty wallets have grown double-digits in a very short time. While this could point to recent selling, it is also quite bullish for crypto going by historical performances. Non-Empty USDT And USDC Wallets Jump 13.9% According to the on-chain data tracking platform Santiment, there has been a significant shift in the number of crypto wallets that are holding stablecoins on their balances. This growth is mostly seen in stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Can’t Reach $0.01, Crypto Pundit Reveals Why As Santiment’s data shows, the total number of non-empty wallets holding USDC has risen 13.9% so far in 2024. Likewise, USDT wallets have also been on the rise, with a marked 15.7% increase in non-empty wallets in the same time period. The chart shows a steady increase in the number of these non-zero wallets as the price of Bitcoin had recovered, taking the whole crypto market along with it. The total among of USDT holders moved from around 4.5 million at the start of the year to 5.7 million at the time of the report. For USDC, this figure went from around 1.9 million to more than 2.15 million. In total, there are more than 7.85 million stablcoin wallets between the both of them. 💸 Concerned about another #crypto market retrace? You may be comforted by the fact that the amount of non-empty #stablecoin wallets are rising. In 2024, the amount of #USDCoin non-empty wallets has grown by +13.9%, and #Tether wallets have grown +15.7%. https://t.co/9K2y8UgOv9 pic.twitter.com/mxdkrgn36M — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 23, 2024 Now, given the recent uptick in the number of non-zero stablecoin wallets, it could suggest there has been some selling. However, stablecoins have seen their market caps increase drastically as more coins have been minted, suggesting that investors are looking to buy rather than sell. Rising Stablecoin Wallets Is Good For Crypto The rise in the non-zero stablecoin wallets are good for crypto, especially in the event of a retrace, as the on-chain tracker points out. This is because investors usually keep their funds in stablecoins waiting for good opportunities to buy, and during market retrace, they tend to deploy stablecoins such as USDT and USDC to buy other assets for low prices. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Set For A New ATH Above $73,700, You Won’t Believe The Timeline A correlation can be seen between the rising Bitcoin and crypto prices this year and the rising stablecoin market cap. For example, the USDT market cap went from $93 billion to over $111 billion since January, signifying a 20% increase. In the same vein, the USDC market cap went from $25 billion in January to over $33 billion in May, representing a 32% increase for the stablecoin. In the last 24 hours alone, over $160 million was moved from the USDC treasury in two transactions into unknown wallets, suggesting that crypto investors are getting ready to get into the market.

42418098,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcbuP,1716463354,Ether Spot ETF Approval Would Raise Expectations Solana Could Also Be Classified as a Commodity: Bernstein,"Approval of a spot ether ETF could bode well for rival tokens such as solana, the report said.  Bernstein said a Trump election win could mean a more crypto-friendly administration.  Galaxy Digital said the approval process could drag on for a few more months.  Approval of a spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. will be seen as significant regulatory relief for the crypto sector and raise expectations for ETH's rival SOL to be categorized as a commodity, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Tuesday.  Latest News: SEC Approves Spot Ether ETF Listing, Still Needs to Approve Issuers' Filings  The report sent to clients days before the SEC's final deadlines on whether to approve some of the ETH ETF applications said the Biden administration might soften its stance on crypto ahead of the November Presidential Elections and a potential Trump victory would be broadly positive.  ""Long term, we do believe, should Trump get elected, crypto could see significant legislative and agency support (with a new SEC chair), to usher in long-lasting structural changes in crypto financial integration,"" analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.  ""More tactically, the Ethereum ETF approval would set the precedent for a first non-Bitcoin blockchain asset to be considered a commodity, raising hopes for Ethereum’s peers (Solana likely) to follow the same path,"" analysts added.  The classification of cryptocurrencies as either securities or commodities has far-reaching implications. For instance, ETF applications and approval hinge on the classification of tokens as commodities. Meanwhile, categorization as a security means a more stringent regulatory oversight by the SEC.  Ether surged higher earlier in the week after two well-followed Bloomberg ETF analysts upped the odds of the SEC approving spot ether ETFS to 75% from 25% and after reports that the regulator had abruptly asked applicants to update their filings, signaling that an approval was more likely. The SEC has several final deadlines on spot ether ETF applications this week after having delayed its decisions a number of times.  Bernstein notes that bitcoin rallied 75% since the approval of spot ETFs, and it expects similar price action for ether. Ether's free float and supply looks more attractive than bitcoin, as 38% of the cryptocurrency is locked in staking, smart contacts and layer 2 chains, and 66% of ETH supply has not moved in the last twelve months, the report noted.  While the ether spot ETF 19b-4 filings are likely to be approved this week, S-1 filings are not expected to go effective for weeks to months, ""resulting in no exchange-tradeable ETH spot vehicles until this summer,"" wrote Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital (GLXY) in a report on Tuesday.  If the SEC approves the spot ETFs, Galaxy speculates that they could launch on exchanges in July or August. Galaxy also expects the regulator to approve all the applications simultaneously to avoid giving any individual issuer a head start.

The recent surge in PEPE's value is partly attributed to its use as a levered bet on the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem, with traders anticipating the approval of a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S.  Pepe (PEPE) zoomed into the twenty largest tokens by market capitalization earlier Thursday as a “beta bet” narrative added nearly 40% to the token in the past week, CoinMarketCap data shows.  The frog-themed token was issued in April 2023, quickly surging to a $1 billion market capitalization weeks after going live. It has since become a meme coin mainstay, reaching a $6 billion market capitalization on Thursday. This has effectively made pepe the biggest meme coin launch of 2023 in a year that saw bonk (BONK), dogwifhat (WIF) and others issued.  PEPE’s recent rise, alongside mog (MOG), has been buoyed by its use as a levered bet on the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem as traders anticipate the approval of a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S.  At least one trader has made it big from a small initial buy. On-chain analysis by Lookonchain shows a crypto address that purchased about $460 worth of the tokens shortly after launch bagged over $3.4 million in profits this week.  The buyer spent 0.22 ETH to buy 324.9B PEPE on April 15, 2023, and deposited the tokens to crypto exchange Binance on Wednesday, Lookonchain said, where the tokens were presumably sold.  It is unknown if the address was connected to the developer team that issued PEPE. However, the usage of automated bots is common among meme coin traders – who typically purchase small amounts of every token that hits the market, based on certain criteria, hoping to eventually catch a big win.  Some traders expect PEPE to eventually flip the dog-themed shiba inu (SHIB), which is valued at a $14 billion market capitalization as of Thursday.  Pepe’s early buys have minted several millionaires in the past year. A few connected wallets turned about $1,200 of initial capital to over $9 million in the week after the token’s launch, as reported, while another $260 purchase netted over $3 million in profits for a different buyer.",POSITIVE,ETH | SHIB | PEPE,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/23/pepes-surge-to-top-20-tokens-turns-early-460-purchase-to-34m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23a0e1279a0c1275a18673781581415b2c0dcb5b-3596x2023.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418106,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcc3h,1716459692,Ether Sees Strongest Bull Momentum in 3 Years as ETF Deadline Nears,"A popular technical study says ether's ongoing uptrend is as strong as the one in May 2021.  Other indicators like the RSI suggest the same, with immediate resistance lined up at $4,090.  What's the opposite of the famous market phrase ""don't catch the falling knife?"" That's the current state of the ether market, where prices are exhibiting the strongest upward momentum in three years.  A week ago, well before the spot ETH ETF speculation gathered steam, CoinDesk reported the possibility of ether's {{ETH}} price bouncing off a key bullish trendline support. Since then, it has surged at least 18% to $3,800, chalking out a bigger-than-expected increase.  More importantly, the second-largest cryptocurrency's momentum indicator, which measures the rate of change in prices over 10 days, has jumped to $880, the highest since May 2021, according to charting platform TradingView.  In other words, the bullish trend is strong; bears looking to sell, if there are any, could easily be run over. It also means that picking a top right now is as risky as attempting to pick a bottom – catching that falling knife – when an asset is experiencing a strong decline.  Traders use the momentum indicator to confirm market trends and spot divergences. A bearish divergence occurs when the indicator decouples from rising prices, hinting at bullish exhaustion and potential correction, or drop.  As of writing, ether's daily price chart (left) shows the momentum indicator rising along with the price, confirming the uptrend.  The 14-day RSI (lower pane) has crossed above 70, which is also a sign of strengthening bullish momentum. The indicator oscillates between 0 and 100. Readings above 70 indicate a strong upward momentum, not as popularly perceived, overbought conditions . Readings below 30 show an acceleration in price sell-off.  The 14-week RSI (right) is fast closing on the 70 level, a threshold that has marked previous parabolic bull runs.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to decide on an application by ETF giant VanEck and Ark/21 Shares this week. A potential launch is widely expected to make way for mainstream funds, sending prices higher.  Options traders from the decentralized marketplace Lyra are positioned for a rally to $5,000 by the end of the second quarter. The immediate resistance is seen at $4,090, the high hit in April, followed by the record price of $4,692 reached during the bull run of 2021.  12:51 UTC: Updates title, adds a para about looming SEC deadline on spot ether applications.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/23/ethers-bull-momentum-is-strongest-since-may-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a86d41a8bd3fe4a60818eaa8711b05369553bd62-1024x576.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

PEPE, the memecoin inspired by the amphibian, has seen a meteoric rise in 2024, leaving established giants Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in its dust. Related Reading: Next Big Move For Bitcoin: Analysts Predict A Potential Breakout At $71,500 From Feels To FOMO: PEPE’s Outperformance PEPE recently shattered its all-time high, reaching a dizzying $0.000014. This impressive feat comes alongside a staggering 900% year-to-date growth, dwarfing the gains of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) This outperformance has crypto investors buzzing, with many questioning if PEPE can dethrone the reigning memecoin monarchs. Analysts point to a potential shift in investor sentiment. While DOGE and SHIB boast larger ecosystems and dedicated communities, their massive market caps limit their potential for explosive growth. PEPE, on the other hand, sits comfortably in the “mid-range memecoin” category, offering investors the allure of high returns without the baggage of a bloated market cap. Can PEPE Maintain Its Momentum? PEPE’s recent price surge is backed by some compelling technical indicators. The Bollinger Band analysis suggests bulls remain in control, with PEPE hovering above its key support level. This, coupled with the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs, could fuel another buying frenzy, propelling the coin towards its predicted target of $0.000020. Total crypto market cap at $2.5 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com However, experts caution against blind optimism. Memecoins are notorious for their wild price swings, and PEPE is no exception. A market correction or negative regulatory decisions could easily send PEPE tumbling. Additionally, unlike DOGE and SHIB, PEPE currently lacks a clear roadmap for utility beyond simply being a memecoin. This raises concerns about its long-term sustainability. Related Reading: Solana Leaves Competition In The Dust: Blazing Speed To Fuel Price Surge? Is It A Worthy Investment? While Pepecoin’s recent surge is undeniably impressive, the road ahead remains uncertain. Investors considering jumping on the memecoin bandwagon should be prepared for a bumpy ride. According to latest data, there is a bullish general mood for the coin price prediction, with 86% technical analysis indicators indicating optimistic signs and 14% indicating bearish indications. While technical indicators suggest a bullish trend for the memecoin, with high investor interest and recent price gains, some caution is advised. The extreme greed reading on the Fear & Greed Index hints at a potentially overheated market.

42418105,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcc1d,1716453947,Ethereum ETF Approval Could Spur 60% Rally as ETH Buying Increases,"The approval of spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S. could lead to a significant rise in the token's value, mirroring the market reaction seen with bitcoin ETFs.  Bitcoin rose to over $73,000 from $42,000 in the two weeks after the ETF started trading on Jan. 11, CoinGecko data shows.  The decision on the ether ETF is expected soon, with significant buying activity observed on both centralized and blockchain-based exchanges.  Approval of spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S. could drive a rally of as much as 60% in the second-largest cryptocurrency in the coming months, QCP Capital said in a Thursday broadcast on Telegram  The forecast echoes the market reaction after spot bitcoin ETFs were approved in January, the Singapore-based firm said. Bitcoin rose to over $73,000 from $42,000 in the two weeks after the ETFs started trading on Jan. 11, CoinGecko data shows.  Latest News: SEC Approves Spot Ether ETF Listing, Still Needs to Approve Issuers' Filings  ""With Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,"" QCP said. ""VanEck’s ETF has been listed by the DTCC. We think approval is now highly likely with trading expected as early as next week.”  Implied volatility measures the market's expectation of future price fluctuations for a financial instrument.  Buying activity increased on both centralized and blockchain-based crypto exchanges, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant said in a Wednesday report. Holders bought over 100,000 ETH in spot markets on Tuesday, the highest daily level since September 2023, as reports of a favorable decision emerged and some analysts bumped odds to over 75% from the earlier 25%.  Open interest on ether-tracked futures spiked in tandem to a record $14 billion. That's 67% of bitcoin open interest as of Wednesday, an unusually high level.  Activity also increased at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, an exchange favored by institutions, with ether futures hitting a record notional $2.85 billion of trading on Tuesday, according to a spokesperson. Ether options traded a record 1,135 contracts ($216 million).  “Traders seem to be getting more exposure now to ETH relative to Bitcoin,” CryptoQuant said. ""The largest daily spot buying from ETH permanent holders so far in 2024.""  Ether prices in the coming days could be volatile after investors sent 62,000 ETH to exchanges, the most since early March, it said. ""High exchange flows are typically associated with price volatility.”  On the flip side, the firm’s analysts warned of a “significant price correction” should the ETF application be dismissed.  Six issuers, including BlackRock, filed updated copies of their ether ETF proposals this week ahead of a decision due today. All removed plans to stake the token, which suggests the activity may have been a regulatory roadblock.  Staking is the process of locking a cryptocurrency for a set period of time to help support the operation of a blockchain, in turn for a reward. These rewards are largely considered passive income among crypto traders.  As of Thursday, annualized yields on ether staking were nearly 3%, according to data from popular staking service Lido.

42418099,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcbwT,1716450254,"Bitcoin, Ether in Stasis as SEC ETF Decision Looms, Nvidia Hits Record High","BTC, ETH keep recent gains ahead of the SEC's decision on VanEck's ether ETF application.  The sharp narrowing in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust's discount suggests a 90% probability of an ETF approval, one analyst said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} consolidated recent gains early Thursday, lacking a clear directional bias before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision on VanEck's spot ether ETF application, due later in the day.  BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded little changed around $69,500, and ether, the No. 2, held steady near $3,700, according to CoinDesk data.  Still, technical analysis and market positioning indicate a bullish undertone. Both cryptocurrencies maintained a strong position above their respective Ichimoku cloud lines, suggesting a bullish outlook, an interpretation echoed by analyst Josh Olszewicz on X. Further evidence came from derivatives exchange Deribit, where options on bitcoin and ether continued to reveal a bias for calls, or derivatives that allow traders to profit from price rises, according to data tracked by Amberdata.  The bullish positioning is likely to have stemmed from increased expectations the SEC will approve spot ether ETFs, broadening the demand for cryptocurrencies.  ""The SEC should approve U.S.-listed ETH ETFs today. Hours before the Bitcoin ETF approval, SEC Gensler tweeted that crypto investors should consider all potential risks before making any investment. Today, a tweet could come around 9 a.m. ET. and would provide more clarity on whether approval would be imminent,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients.  Thielen added that the Grayscale Ethereum Trust's discount to net asset value has narrowed to just 8% from 30% a week ago, implying at least ""a 90% probability that an ETF would be approved.""  The change follows reports early this week that the SEC had asked for updates and amendments from spot ether ETF applicants, signaling potential approval.  ""If spot ether ETFs are approved, that signals a sharp change in the official attitude toward the crypto industry – it also looks like hostility toward FIT21 is not as strong as we had feared,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, told CoinDesk, referring to the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.  On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the act, which will clearly define whether cryptocurrencies are commodities or securities. Categorization as securities would mean a stringent SEC oversight. The legislation is also expected to establish the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a leading regulator of digital assets alongside the SEC.  The bill now moves to the Senate, where its future is uncertain. Even if passed, President Joe Biden could still veto it.  NVDA hits record high  Shares in the Nasdaq-listed chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) reached a record high during Wednesday's post-market hours after the company beat analyst estimates to report record revenue of $26.04 billion for the first quarter.  The rally might be a positive signal for cryptocurrencies, including tokens supposedly associated with artificial intelligence (AI) technology. That's because, historically, the inflow of money into the crypto market and the so-called AI coins has been partly contingent on outsized gains in NVDA and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.  According to Coingecko, top AI coins, such as FET, ICP, RNDR and GRT, traded mixed at the time of writing, having rallied in the lead-up to the NVDA announcement.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/23/bitcoin-ether-in-stasis-as-sec-etf-decision-looms-nvidia-hits-record-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d94c53d3ea828f3d8457dab408063aab24afe3f-1280x785.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analysts are divided on whether a bullish breakout or an extended consolidation period lies ahead. Related Reading: Solana Leaves Competition In The Dust: Blazing Speed To Fuel Price Surge? Reaching New Highs: Euphoric Bulls On The Horizon? Renowned crypto analyst Checkmate has ignited a spark of optimism with his “Euphoric Bull” theory. According to Checkmate, a surge to a new all-time high could signal a critical shift in market sentiment. This type of bull phase would represent a significant acceleration in bullish momentum, potentially leading to a steeper price increase. Checkmate’s theory hinges on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a metric that compares the current market value of Bitcoin to the total value paid to acquire all Bitcoins in circulation. Historically, when the MVRV ratio climbs above one standard deviation of its average, it has often preceded a shift to a “Euphoric Bull” phase. #Bitcoin breaking to a new ATH has historically represented a transition point from the Enthusiastic Bull, into the Euphoric Bull. It also coincides with the MVRV ratio getting above 1 standard deviation, but we rarely clear it on the first attempt. Bull…Crab…Bull… A… pic.twitter.com/4YyD179LRS — _Checkmate 🟠🔑⚡☢️🛢️ (@_Checkmatey_) May 21, 2024 However, Checkmate warns that Bitcoin doesn’t always follow the script on the first try. The market often exhibits cautious behavior, with Bitcoin potentially attempting to breach this key MVRV level multiple times before a decisive breakout. Bitcoin’s recent consolidation period comes after a surge that saw the alpha crypto reach a six-week high of $71,950. While a slight pullback has occurred, Bitcoin is still trading comfortably near the $70,000 level, with a healthy daily trading volume. This price movement suggests a potential pause before the next significant move, making the current moment a tense waiting game for both traders and investors. Breakout Or Consolidation? A Bullish Dilemma Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has emerged as a key voice in the ongoing debate. Rekt Capital believes a weekly candle closing above $71,500 could be the catalyst for a significant breakout. This milestone, if achieved, could trigger a surge in bullish momentum, propelling Bitcoin towards a notable uptrend. However, Rekt Capital also acknowledges the possibility of an extended consolidation phase. Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a tendency to consolidate within its re-accumulation range for several weeks before experiencing a breakout. This extended consolidation, Rekt Capital argues, would bring Bitcoin closer to aligning with historical halving cycles, events that have historically preceded major bull runs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Seen Breaching $73,000 As ‘Bull Run’ Looms, Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Prediction Meanwhile, other analysts are predicting a potential banner year for the world’s leading cryptocurrency in 2025. The high-end prediction of $168,459 represents a staggering potential increase, fueled by factors like historical price trends and the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. Buoying this optimism are technical indicators pointing towards a “Bullish” market sentiment with a hefty dose of “Extreme Greed.” However, a dose of reality is necessary. The wide range between the predicted high and low ($69,971) underscores the inherent uncertainty in these forecasts. Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, evident in the recent 4.47% price swings within just 30 days, further complicates things. While this level of greed suggests investor confidence, it can also be a warning sign of a potential market correction on the horizon.

This change was likely made to avoid regulatory roadblocks. Staking is considered a form of passive income in the crypto world.  BlackRock, Grayscale and Bitwise on Wednesday filed amended 9b-4 forms with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for their proposed spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  All the updated forms removed the provisions for staking ether, which some say was causing a regulatory roadblock.  “Neither the Trust, nor the Sponsor, nor the Ether Custodian [...] nor any other person associated with the Trust will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the Trust’s ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings,” the amended BlackRock filing said.  Staking is the process of locking specific cryptocurrencies for a set period to help support the operation of a blockchain, in turn, for a reward. These rewards are considered mainly passive income among crypto traders.  As of Thursday, annualized yields on ether staking were nearly 3%, according to data from popular staking service Lido.  All ether ETF hopefuls have now filed their amended proposals ahead of an approval or disapproval decision expected on Thursday.  Fidelity filed its amended S-1 forms earlier this week, dropping its staking plans. Later, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Invesco Galaxy and ARK 21Shares filed similar amendments to remove staking. Hashdex is the only issuer yet to file an amendment to its Ethereum ETF.  As such, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has started listing VanEck’s Ether ETF under the ticker symbol ETHV on its site, which some take as a positive sign.  On Monday, influential Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart updated their odds of approval to 75% from the earlier 25%, causing a market-wide jump. Ether rose over 17%, while bitcoin retook the $71,000 mark for the first time since early April.  Market watchers have described the move as a sudden change in tone for the SEC, which was earlier said not to be considering the approval of an ether ETF. In an interview with Unchained, Seyffart said the issue had become “political,” with the decision coming “from above, likely Biden.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/23/blackrock-grayscale-bitwise-file-updated-19b-forms-in-rush-for-ethereum-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27b53cfa82766953ae1a35280e08d80682d4961f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The transfer process is expected to be slow, and the exact location of the new prison is undisclosed.

The location of the new prison is undisclosed as of early Thursday but is thought to be in California, WSJ said. He is likely to be placed in a medium-security prison.  However, the judge who oversaw Bankman-Fried's trial issued an order that recommended he be kept jailed in New York ""to facilitate access to appellate counsel.""  As such, the actual transfer could take over a month, as the process is thought to be slow.  In March, the crypto mogul was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $11 billion. He was earlier convicted of seven counts of fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering.

28296504,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609312,1716426037,Ethereum Whales Come Alive: Are They Buying Or Selling?,"On-chain data suggests the Ethereum whales have shown a burst of activity recently. Here’s what these titans have been up to. Ethereum Whale Transactions Are At Their Highest Since March In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed how the ETH whales have become active recently. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “Number of Large Transactions,” which, according to the analytics firm, tracks the total number of Ethereum transactions on the network valued at more than $100,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals Trigger For 17% Polygon (MATIC) Rally Generally, only whale entities can make such large single transaction movements, so such large transfers are associated with these humongous investors. As such, the Number of Large Transactions indicator can tell us whether this cohort is active right now. The chart below shows the recent trend in this Ethereum metric. The graph shows that the Number of large transactions for Ethereum has sharply increased recently. This suggests that the whales have ramped up their activity. The whales have come alive as news surfaced that the ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could have improved their approval odds. The hype in the market has meant that ETH has enjoyed a rapid increase, taking its price back around the $3,800 level. With all this happening in the market, it’s only natural that these humongous entities would be repositioning themselves. As the scale of this cohort’s transactions is quite big, a large number of them taking place together can be powerful enough to cause ripples in the market. Thus, ETH could likely witness volatility shortly if the current high whale activity persists. However, the direction this volatility might take on Ethereum depends on whether these investors collectively buy or sell. IntoTheBlock data has also provided hints about this, as the below chart for the “Large Holders Netflow” shows. This indicator measures the net amount of Ethereum moving into or out of the wallets of “Large Holders.” The analytics firm defines Large Holders as those who own at least 0.1% of the entire circulating asset supply. Related Reading: Analyst Says $71,000 Bitcoin Move Is Only Halfway Through, Here’s Why The graph shows that the Large Holders have been participating in accumulation recently, as the netflow has been positive for them. Thus, it appears that the recent activity from the whales has involved net-buying. It remains to be seen if these humongous entities will continue to display this trend in the coming days, potentially helping fuel the rally. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $3,750, up more than 26% over the past week.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls On The Rise: Analyst Highlight Path To $0.2 Dogecoin Transactions Soar As ETF Speculation Intensifies According to data from IntoTheBlock, the value of these large transactions exceeding $100,000 has significantly increased within the past 24 hours. This dramatic increase saw the total value surge from $1.53 billion to roughly $3.01 billion. Concurrently, the volume of DOGE transferred by these whales expanded from 9.74 billion to 17.97 billion DOGE coins, indicating a marked uptick in investor engagement and movement within the Dogecoin ecosystem. This significant uptick in whale transactions coincides with mounting speculation in the crypto community regarding the potential approval of a Dogecoin ETF. The enthusiasm around a possible Ethereum ETF has sparked conversations about DOGE being the next cryptocurrency to have its exchange-traded fund. Amidst the rumors, a notable post by a crypto enthusiast, Vee, on X suggested that Dogecoin’s non-security status and widespread adoption make it an ideal candidate for an ETF. The post highlighted the dual-edged nature of traditional financial institutions’ interest in Dogecoin, ironically pointing out both the potential benefits and drawbacks. a dogecoin etf would be amusing — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) May 21, 2024 Billy Markus, a co-creator of Dogecoin, humorously commented on the speculation, noting that a Dogecoin ETF would be “amusing.” This sentiment reflects DOGE’s light-hearted origin but doesn’t detract from its serious investment potential, highlighted by recent market trends. Dogecoin is following the global crypto market’s uptrend, with an 11.2% increase over the past week. However, in the last 24 hours, the increase has been a modest 0.7%, with the crypto trading at $0.168. Technical Analysis Of DOGE And Future Prospects Analysts are watching Dogecoin closely. A prominent crypto analyst, Ali, noted that DOGE is nearing a critical resistance level, suggesting potential upward movement soon.
