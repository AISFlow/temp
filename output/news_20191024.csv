42374510,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWva09N,1571961524,How Should Crypto Prepare for Google's 'Quantum Supremacy'?,"""Quantum supremacy."" The term inspires images of a giant world-brain supercomputer that can count the grains of sand on every beach on Earth. But what does Google's official claim of supremacy mean and how will practical quantum computing change the world of crypto?  After a month of speculation, Google announced that it has built and tested a 54-qubit quantum processor called ""Sycamore."" The processor, which looks like it's covered in a writhing mass of serpents inside its super-cooled cryo-chamber, was able to perform a complex computation in 200 seconds. Not that big a deal, right?  ""From measurements in our experiment we determined that it would take the world’s fastest supercomputer 10,000 years to produce a similar output,"" wrote Sycamore's creators in a blog post.  Quantum processors work by using superposition and entanglement. These odd quantum behaviors essentially allow a quantum chip to process massive amounts of data simultaneously. To better understand it, imagine that, like Dr. Strange, a quantum processor can ""see"" every possible outcome at once and then, statistically, pick the most likely answer. This means time-consuming programs like factoring large numbers – finding the two large numbers that, when multiplied, makes another large number – is trivial for a quantum computer.  These machines are nothing new. Services like D-Wave's Leap let anyone write programs for a cloud-based quantum computer in Python, a feat that seems like science fiction. However, in Google's case, the company has achieved ""quantum supremacy"" over nearly every other machine in existence – a claim that means, in theory, quite a lot and, in practice, very little.  Quantum supremacy means that Google has been able to perform a calculation that is impossible to perform on traditional computing hardware. In other words, no ""classical"" computer – from the fastest mainframe to an Atari 800XL – would ever be able to complete the calculation within a reasonable time, aka before the heat death of the universe or 10,000 years, whichever comes first.  ""With the first quantum computation that cannot reasonably be emulated on a classical computer, we have opened up a new realm of computing to be explored,"" wrote the researchers.  All is not galaxy minds and AI, however. First, it's not clear whether or not Google's claims are correct because, to test whether they have achieved quantum supremacy, they would need to run the same problem on classical computers which, in theory, would take 10,000 years. Further, the problems you can traditionally solve on a quantum computer aren't completely practical. Quantum computers are great at finding the shortest path in a multi-node network but not so good at playing Doom. So the comparison is never apples to apples.  But what does quantum supremacy mean for crypto and crypto mining, where having a highly efficient machine gives you an edge over everyone else?  Quantum Leap  The biggest danger to blockchain networks from quantum computing is its ability to break traditional encryption.  If you wanted to truly ruin cryptocurrencies, you'd aim a quantum computer at SHA-256 – a popular hashing algorithm that creates 32-byte ""hashes"" of passwords, essentially turning them into unreadable gibberish (to wit: ""5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8"" is ""password"").  Quantum computing experts see SHA-256 as a proverbial canary in a coal-mine. When a true quantum exploit begins invading systems worldwide, researchers will know to panic.  “Quantum computing will impact many forms of encryption including SHA-256, which is used by bitcoin. Since Bitcoin has value, people will have more of an incentive to attack it. However, I believe many easier encryption algorithms will be broken first and alert the community that it’s time for a change,"" said Patrick Dai, founder and CEO of Qtum, a business-focused blockchain provider, adding:  ""Breaking SHA-256 isn’t something that happens overnight. We will have many warnings. Ultimately miners will pay the price when the switch happens, because they are stuck with incompatible hardware, but bitcoin will continue to progress.”  Ultimately researchers believe we are on track to break hashing algorithms and even the asymmetric cryptography systems that power our public and private keys.  ""Quantum computing will force all cryptocurrencies to adopt to new signing algorithms, as current ones (the ones used by Bitcoin and Ethereum as well) are proven to be vulnerable to signature forgery,"" said Johann Polecsak, CTO of QAN, the creator of an allegedly quantum-proof blockchain.  Vitalik Buterin, for his part, isn't bullish on quantum computing.  ""My one-sentence impression of recent quantum supremacy stuff so far is that it is to real quantum computing what hydrogen bombs are to nuclear fusion,"" he wrote. ""Proof that a phenomenon and the capability to extract power from it exist, but still far from directed use toward useful things.""  ""Asymmetric cryptography relies on keypairs, namely a private and public key. Public keys can be calculated from their private counterpart, but not the other way around. This is due to the impossibility of certain mathematical problems. Quantum computers are more efficient in accomplishing this by magnitudes, and if the calculation is done the other way (we could calculate private keys FROM public keys) then the whole scheme breaks. This is proven and we only need more qubits and stability in these systems, which are continuously developed further,"" he said.  David Chaum, creator of Praxxis, believes that proof-of-work systems will be more resistant to quantum attacks, even if wallets and keys won't be.  ""The hashing algorithms in Proof of Work (PoW) protocols that require mining are generally resistant to quantum computing,"" he said. ""The more likely angle of attack for an adversary with a quantum computer is to break the security of wallets in PoW or Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols.""  Quantum computers can use something called Shor's algorithm to factor the long integers used by cryptocurrencies to secure wallets. The expectation is that any actor able to use quantum computing to break RSA – the cryptographic standard for most popular platforms – will probably keep quiet.  ""Given the unpredictability of scientific progress, and the likelihood of secrecy, forecasting exactly when quantum computers will break blockchain crypto is a fool’s errand,"" said Chaum. ""With that said, while the barriers to quantum computer development are difficult to overcome, there is no evidence that they are insurmountable.""  He added:  ""One day soon, a quantum computer capable of using Shor’s algorithm to defeat many cryptosystems will be produced. The blockchain community would be foolish to ignore this threat until that day comes. The NSA directed government agencies to halt work on quantum-susceptible cryptosystems more than four years ago. The NSA is taking quantum computing seriously. So should we.""     The bottom line is simple: once quantum supremacy starts to touch real-world implementations – including crypto – all heck will break loose. The only way to reduce the damage is to be prepared.  ""In the case of bitcoin, if someone has quantum computing capability before others, they might be able to start moving some large bitcoin balances before the network is upgraded. The best defense right now is to only use a bitcoin address once, so the public key is not revealed,"" said Adrian Scott, CEO of Freedom Stack, a crypto startup.  Unfortunately, like the spooky nature of quantum bits, no one knows what will happen when these machines begin attacking popular crypto platforms. Said Scott:  ""This is like a Y2K problem for crypto, as it does mean significant upgrades to platforms across networks, software libraries used by many applications, integrations with other systems, etcetera. We also don't know for sure how quantum-resistant the 'quantum resistant' approaches are.""

Paul Cappelli is the portfolio manager for both funds, though they will be passively managed, meaning the investments (in this case, bitcoin) are automatically selected.

42403428,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfwpN,1571930144,PODCAST: Ikigai's Travis Kling on Why Bitcoin Is a 'Baby X-Man',"“Bitcoin is unequivocally a macro asset,” said Travis Kling, the former hedge funder and now founder and CIO of Ikigai Asset Management.  “It is a fledgling macro asset,” Kling continued, adding:  “Seven-plus years of [bitcoin’s life] it really was just kind of a computer science experiment in the closet of a bunch of computer science nerds. And then, it was a magic internet money for drug dealers to buy drugs on the internet. And then, it was ‘blockchain and not bitcoin.’ And then, it was for Americans to buy coffee at Starbucks, maybe it was to save Venezuelans from a million percent inflation. It's gone through a number of phases in its history, but I would say that two-three years ago, it stepped out onto the global stage and its presence there has only strengthened since then.”  Kling spoke with CoinDesk for one of the inaugural episodes of Bitcoin Macro, a pop-up podcast featuring the speakers and themes of CoinDesk's upcoming Invest: NYC conference on Tuesday, Nov. 12.  Listen to the podcast here or read the whole transcript below.  The last six months have seen a growing dialogue between the bitcoin industry and the larger global macro community. No longer written off as some ignorable niche, people are increasingly asking: Is bitcoin a macro asset? Is it a safe-haven asset? How will it perform in the next recession?  Travis Kling has exploded onto the bitcoin scene over the past year. Spending ten years in traditional finance before moving to crypto, Kling has become a mainstay for his clear-headed analysis of larger market trends – which he has called “the longest monetary policy experiment in history.”  In this episode of Bitcoin Macro, CoinDesk’s Nolan Bauerle sat down with Kling to discuss:  Why bitcoin is a fledgling macro asset that has significantly increased its footprint on the global stage.  Why bitcoin is currently a risk asset, but why people think it’s showing signs of a future safe haven asset.  Why how bitcoin reacts in a recession might be based on what type of recession it is.  Why he believes Fed Repo market intervention has impacted the recent bitcoin price downtick.  Why every time the bitcoin price crashes and recovers, it brings more recalcitrant institutions into the fold.  Why the most interesting charts of the year to him are those comparing bitcoin to other safe-haven assets.      Nolan Bauerle: Welcome to Bitcoin Macro, a popup podcast produced as part of the CoinDesk Invest New York Conference in November. I'm your host, Nolan Bauerle. Both the podcast and the event explore the intersection of bitcoin and the global macro economy with perspectives from some of the leading thinkers in finance, crypto, and beyond.  I'm here with Travis Kling from Ikigai Asset Management. Ikigai Asset Management is a crypto hedge fund. We're here really to give a preview of the kind of content and speaker that we'll have at our event in November. One of our major themes this year is really bitcoin as it is in the world today. We want to get some idea from some of our speakers of how they see bitcoin on the global stage.  So, we're going to be running a series of speakers through this podcast over the next few weeks to answer some preview questions about things that we'll be talking about on stage. So, these questions will be of a similar order for each of the speakers, and really are about bitcoin's behavior. The first question, Travis, is bitcoin a macro asset?  Travis Kling: Thanks for having me, Nolan. Bitcoin in unequivocally a macro asset. It is a fledgling macro asset. It's been around for going on 11 years now. And first, I would say seven plus years of that it really was just kind of a computer science experiment in the closet of a bunch of computer science nerds. And then, it was a magic internet money for drug dealers to buy drugs on the internet. And then, it was blockchain and not bitcoin. And then, it was for Americans to buy coffee at Starbucks, maybe it was to save Venezuelans from a million percent inflation. It's gone through a number of phases in its history, but I would say that two-three years ago, it stepped out onto the global stage and its presence there has only strengthened since then. It's definitely our expectation that it's going to continue to strength over time.  Nolan Bauerle: So, as you see some of these movements, global uncertainty, we see this sort of, perhaps what people have called it de-globalization of the world with a lot of these trade war issues. Do you see bitcoin ... so you've got sort of the main stage of macro assets within that, is bitcoin in the wings waiting to come on stage? Is it actually on stage and maybe in the background? Where is it in that scene? Is it right in the main stage already and no one knows, or is it in the wings, is it a background singer? Where is it?  Travis Kling: I think it's a baby X-Man.  Nolan Bauerle: A baby X-Man?  Travis Kling: That's what I think it is.  Nolan Bauerle: So, the X-Man being the mutation part of it?  Travis Kling: And stronger than everything else, but still a baby. So, a normal person could probably walk over and push on a baby X-Man and it'll tump over and maybe it'll even cry a little bit. But it's pretty clear what it's going to be when it grows up.  Nolan Bauerle: I like that assessment. And would you say that the grow up part is really a sort of Lindy effect aspect? That the length of time that it's around, does that make it more like gold because it survived?  Travis Kling: Lindy effect definitely matters. Seeing these booms in the boom and bust cycles matters. The amount of people paying attention to it as it booms and busts, I think definitely matters. Because I think 2017 ushered in ... like, that brought Bitcoin to the global stage and it ran up 13X in calendar year 2017, and it went down 73 percentage points in calendar year 2018. And you know, when we were sitting here in mid-December of 2018, there were a lot of no-coiners that were feeling really vindicated, right?  And there were a lot of RIAs that had their clients banging down their doors telling them, ""Why am I not in this? Don't I need to get into this?"" Everybody was feeling very vindicated, right? And then, just like that, it's up 160% year to date and is the best performing asset class by a wide margin. The expectation is for that to continue. And I think that the way that that continues to play out over the next couple years is pretty unequivocally heading in the right direction. And now that there are more and more eyes on it then we've got more and more potential people that have now done the work and are ready to invest.  Nolan Bauerle: So, you had mentioned a note about Venezuela. Is bitcoin a safe haven asset? Is this something that can be used in instances where there are this kind of trouble? Is there a larger scenario than the ones we're always talking about, about Venezuela? Can this be used for what's going on in Hong Kong, for example? By safe-haven asset, I mean, is this something that really is a manipulatable or maneuverable instrument right now for a lot of these people? Is it accessible to them?  Travis Kling: Yeah. Like we talked about a minute ago, bitcoin's gone through a bunch of phases in its life, and I think that sometimes people get confused about literally what is bitcoin. And so, I always like to take the opportunity. Bitcoin is a non-sovereign, hard cap supply, global, immutable, decentralized, digital store of value. And that's a lot of adjectives to throw in front of there. But each one of them is important. It is a hedge against monetary and fiscal policy, irresponsibility from central banks and governments globally. Now, bitcoin is undoubtedly a risk asset today and it acts as such. It is not a safe haven asset today. People are speculating that bitcoin will become a safe haven asset one day because it has the characteristics to be a safe haven asset. Gold has been gold for 5,000 years. Before we stored value in gold, we stored value in seashells. We stored value in salt. We stored value in really big rocks in the Asian-Pacific islands.  There's characteristics around what makes a good store of value. And it's the six characteristics of money, it's an Austrian economics framework. It's durable, it's divisible, it's portable, it's uniform, it's accepted, and it's scarce. And when you look at gold next to BTC within that framework, BTC actually lines up really well. Like I said, gold's been gold for 5,000 years, bitcoin's been around for 10 and a half years. It jumped out of obscurity about three years ago. So, it's going to take a little bit longer than three years to usurp a 5,000-year store of value. And you know, I'm not even saying that that's necessarily going to happen in our lifetime. But BTC's market cap is 160 billion right now, and gold's market cap is eight trillion. If you just claw into just a part of that, then obviously the return potential is tremendous from here.  Nolan Bauerle: So, the question then is, who gets to nine trillion first?  Travis Kling: I would guess with what's going on in the world right now, gold will get there first. The future's exceedingly bright. And to go back to the Venezuelan point, and I don't want to talk about something that I don't know about because I've never been to Venezuela, and I really feel for the folks and the situation that's going on down there. But I think that if I'm in Venezuela and I can choose between a bolivar or a bitcoin, I'm definitely going to choose a bitcoin. But what I really want is a dollar. And a dollar is a great method of exchange.  Right now, bitcoin is not as good of a method of exchange and that's okay. I like to say that bitcoin's too good at being a store of value today to be a good method of exchange today because nobody wants to be the bitcoin pizza guy that spent 1,000 BTC on a pizza. And the expectation is that the price is going to continue to rise, realized volatility is going to continue to fall as it has been. I like to remind people of that. Bitcoin's a very volatile asset, but the realized volatility of bitcoin is decreasing at a logarithmic rate. So, really quickly. As quickly as the price is going up, which is 22 million percent over bitcoin's lifetime.  As that continues to occur and you have Lightning Network being built out, which is Bitcoin's Layer 2 scaling solution, and eventually it's our expectation that you're going to have a make or die type of solution built on Lightning, where you can stake BTC, get back stable coin, pay interest on that stable coin as long as you pay that back, then you get your BTC back. Lightning is essentially infinitely scalable. And so, it's okay that it's not a great method of exchange right now.  Nolan Bauerle: So, you had mentioned that it's got these qualities, but that it is still able to be, let's say, pushed over as this baby X-Man, which I think is great image. You know, it's on stage and it can be pushed over. And the next question is, what does it do in a recession? Does a recession push it over, or do we start to see the actual attributes, those super powers come out in a recession? Because we might be there. So, this is a low time preference question.  Travis Kling: It's a great question. It's a complicated answer. I think the first thing I'd say is it depends on what type of recession. And it depends on where the recession emanates from. It depends on the severity of the cause or causes of the recession. And it depends on what the response of central banks and governments globally to that recession are. So, for example, right now we're going through this dollar shortage situation that has been certainly all over mainstream financial media, and for good reason.  Nolan Bauerle: Looks like 2006.  Travis Kling: Yeah. I mean, there's aspects. The first symptom of this dollar shortage situation first popped up when the Fed funds was offsides from the overnight offer rate, and then you had the repo market, and that's been going on now for like six months. That's not supposed to happen. The rational actor explanation for why that spread between the Fed funds and the overnight offer rate would persistently stay open is one that's kind of scary. And then, we have the repo market blowout last week. And you had the treasury, Fed, have to step in and essentially issue 53 billion dollars worth of quantitative easing to assuage this situation.  And people, Jay Powell, at the Fed meeting last week and others are calling this transitory, saying, ""This is because corporations have to pay their cash taxes right now,"" even though they have to pay cash taxes every time this year, so everybody should know that that's going on. They're saying that it's because of the 600 billion of treasuries issued between now and the end of the year, that's sucking up all the dollars. There's probably some truth to that. But this is exactly what happened right before Lehman. They said it was transitory then too. And I'm not saying that there's a Lehman lurking around the corner, because I don't think that there is. But there are problems starting to show up here.  The global economic data is undoubtedly turning down right now. And it's turning down in concert. It's all turning down at the same time. It's all turning down at the same time because the whole world is now on this central bank trade, and on this cheap money trade. But it's apparent that central banks are going to cut interest rates and juice QE into infinity to either prevent a recession or kind of have the recession be as soft as possible. And those forms of quantitative easing are going to be increasingly more exotic because in the same way that, you know, if you do heroin long enough, then you got to keep taking a bigger and bigger shot of heroin, you need increasingly more exotic forms of QE to get a similar type of effect. Because if you're in Europe and you cut the interest rates from -40 bips to -50 bips, it just doesn't make that big of a difference.  Nolan Bauerle: Yeah, they're not going to change their habits all of a sudden.  Travis Kling: Yeah. And so, if there is a big liquidity squeeze that kind of immediately kicked off the financial crisis last time around ... the financial crisis, it wasn't ... like, Lehman didn't go down because of subprime. It went down because of the overnight lending market. And then, there was a liquidity crunch. Subprime was sort of the skeleton in the closet, but it was the overnight market, repo markets that really caused this;  Nolan Bauerle: That's what made it irredeemable.  Travis Kling: Yeah. And so, if you have some kind of liquidity squeeze like that again that kicks off another recession, yeah, it's my expectation that bitcoin price will go down in that. I mean, we're sitting here talking about this the day after bitcoin's price went down more than 10%, which was a week after the repo market blew out.  Nolan Bauerle: How do you mean they're related? In a sense that they ... from a certain point of view, it's the exact opposite behavior you would expect.  Travis Kling: So, the euro-dollar market is another way to think about this, which is literally like a quadrillion dollar market annually, and most liquid sort of market of anything in the world. If you throw a big rock in the middle of a pond, how far do the ripples emanate? They ripple all the way out, increasingly smaller ripples. So, if you throw a wrench in the quadrillion dollar euro-dollar market, how far do the hiccups spread? And the 30-day circulating supply of bitcoin is 15 billion dollars. So, how small does the ripple of the global liquidity market have to be to send the 15 billion dollars of circulating supply of BTC down 10 percent on any given day. It just doesn't take much.  Nolan Bauerle: There was a chart, I think, that you mentioned to me a little while ago about the HODL Waves along that line which was, look, what bitcoin is actually available out there because you've got all the HODLers, and they have this bet and they've had this bet for a long time about the extinguishment of power of central banks and that that will be a trade, and that the global traders are coming to bet against the banks. So, you mentioned this HODL chart. How do you use this HODL chart to see what's going on, and to really understand bitcoin's liquidity in this instance?  Travis Kling: Yeah. So, we like to look at just overall trends, and we look at how much BTC has moved in the last 1 day, in the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and five years. And you know, a gentle reminder that there's like two and a half million bitcoin that have never moved before, right? And so, all bitcoin in existence is like 18 million, but like two and a half million of those are probably lost or they're Satoshi's, and I don't think he's moving them any time soon.  And you can see trends. There's really interesting trends in terms of periods of accumulation, and then periods of distribution in terms of old coins not moving for an extended period of time, and then moving. And the bottom line is that if you're seeing older coins stay put, then the price really can't go down all that much because you're just continuing to take new coin that is in sort of loose hands and transferring it into stronger hands that understand the potential and the promise of bitcoin and aren't going to sell them for $3,000 a coin, for example, in mid-December.  And so, there's lots of derivations of work that we do around HODL Waves, and we also talk about days destroyed, bitcoin days destroyed, which is the sort of opposite side of HODL Waves, which is, if I buy one bitcoin, hold it in my wallet for a year, and then I send it to an exchange. On that day, there are 365 bitcoin days destroyed, right? Because you stacked up, you held the bitcoin for a year, and then you moved it. And the beauty of the blockchain is that every single Satoshi you can track like that in real time. And so, for a naturally analytical guy like myself, there's a whole host of really fun analysis you can do there.  Nolan Bauerle: It's a dear diary.  Travis Kling: Yeah, it's great.  Nolan Bauerle: Dear diary...  So, I want to go back a bit to what we were talking about just a few minutes ago about the quantitative easing and that large trade that the central banks are asking everyone to make. You know, it's always been my opinion anyway, that Satoshi Nakamoto took the Japanese pseudonym in order to say and have a type of authority that, ""I know what happened in Japan in the 90s and the lost decade and the negative yield,"" and all that stuff. And basically, wagging his finger to America and the rest of the world to say that, ""You're now in this boat. You now have a completely weakened central bank that doesn't actually have the levers to pull any longer. They will fall into the cycle of perpetual QE."" Is that sort of a ... and I'm not saying you have to subscribe to the Satoshi Nakamoto, 1990s, tying it in to Japan thing, but is that what you're seeing? Is it basically that, that the levers are broken and this is the trade to make because this power is gone?  Travis Kling: I had never thought about the Japanese aspect of it, and it makes a lot of sense. It strikes me as, from what we know about Satoshi, it strikes me as the kind of thing that he would do. Unequivocally libertarian, unequivocally cognizant of what central banks were doing at the time, the white paper came out the week after Lehman collapsed. I mean, look no further than what written on the Genesis Block on January 3rd, 2009, ""Chancellor on brink of second bailout of banks."" I think that tells you all you need to know about what Satoshi was thinking about when he was creating and giving bitcoin to the world.\  Nolan Bauerle: So, Travis, you do come from a more traditional background. And the next question is really about how you, I guess you can say, still peer over that fence. So, how has the narrative changed round bitcoin in the mainstream financial world over the last six months? Is it that different? And I'm saying six months, not from 2017.  Travis Kling: Yeah.  Nolan Bauerle: You did mention a bit about how there was a bunch of schadenfreude back in December when everyone was laughing at bitcoin people. You know, and now here we are, I guess almost 10 months from that big laugh they had. Where are we?  Travis Kling: So, the first thing I'd say is still not dead, right?  Nolan Bauerle: Mm-hmm (affirmative), which is a very important thing.  Travis Kling: Yeah. Bitcoin's price has declined more than 70% seven times in its history. In '18 it did another one of those. And you know, every single time it's sort of come roaring back to life and now it's 230% off the lows in mid-December, far and away the best performing asset of 2019 across all asset classes. There has been increasingly more work that's been done by institutional investors and folks from more traditional asset classes that didn't have experience in crypto that have done more of the research to understand what bitcoin is, some of the mechanics around how it works because it's like, look, the mechanics are not bite-sized, I get it. I knew nothing about cryptography before I jumped into all this. I knew nothing about computer science before I jumped into all this. Mechanism design, game theory, sociology, governance. There's a lot of things that you have to think through-  Nolan Bauerle: A deep talent stack.  Travis Kling: Yeah, I mean, it encompasses many things. And so, you're not going to bang out three 30-minute blog posts and get it, right? You're not going to listen to one podcast and get it. But increasingly investors have done the work and are incentivized to do the work because now everybody's sitting in there, thinking about what they were doing in mid-December when bitcoin was $3,000 or January/February when it was low $3,000s, and thinking, ""Oh man, if I'd of ... you know, I almost put 100 grand into that thing at the time. If I'd of just done that, I would have had the down payment on a nice house right now."" People think like that, right?  Nolan Bauerle: Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Travis Kling: Institutional investors think like that. We're humans. And so, I think that that's part of it. And then, in the meantime, look you've got increasingly more institutional grade infrastructure that's being built, right? A year ago, Fidelity didn't custody this thing. A year ago, the New York Stock Exchange didn't trade this thing. A year ago, Whole Foods didn't accept this thing. A year ago, Microsoft wasn't building an identity platform on top of this thing. A year ago, you didn't have half a dozen qualified custodians in this thing. So, regulated exchanges all ... like, the space's maturation, you know, sometimes I wish it moved faster but when you take a step back and look at the forest through the trees, we've covered a lot of ground over the last two years. And so, I think the outside world is definitely taking note of that.  Nolan Bauerle: So, we've talked about a lot of things today. We talked about QE, we've talked about global hedge, we've talked about safe-haven currency, a bit about the technical innovations coming on bitcoin. But what I would like now, is really just a chart that informs this, I'd say, really optimistic and powerful belief you have behind bitcoin.  Travis Kling: Yeah. So, my chart is the chart of over the last year of the price of gold, the price of the offshore renminbi, and the price of bitcoin, which moved pretty much in tandem until a little over a month ago. And then, BTC has pulled back while gold and the renminbi have shot up higher. The safe-haven store of value digital gold, I've heard some macro investors call bitcoin high beta gold, which I think is like an interesting way to sort of think about it.  There's been a disconnect over the last six weeks or so. And why is that disconnect happening? I'm not going to pretend here and say that I know exactly. There may be a situation where bitcoin can act as a safe haven asset up to a certain level of stress in financial markets, or act as a safe haven towards some types of financial stress, or it may just be that it's a safe haven at $6,000. And it wasn't a safe haven at $13,000. And you know, bitcoin's price moves swiftly. And so, we'll see how all of that plays out.  Travis Kling: But I think, you know, I could throw aggregate negative-yielding sovereign debt, I could throw that on that chart and it would look like a pretty similar situation. I could throw the 10-year break even in terms of the inflation expectations. It's all sort of ... it's all wrapped up in this same sort of central banker type of driven trade. And you know, I think bitcoin has the ability to be right there in the middle of it. We'll see how it plays out through the rest of this year and moving into 2020.  Nolan Bauerle: Travis, thanks a ton for your time. Really interesting stuff. See you in November at Consensus Invest.  Travis Kling: Pleasure. Thanks, Nolan.  Nolan Bauerle: Thanks a ton.

42403421,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfwjT,1571930129,PODCAST: Caitlin Long on Bitcoin as Insurance Against Financial Collapse,"“To me, it's an insurance against instability in the mainstream financial industry,"" said Caitlin Long, one of the most experienced Wall Street professionals to defect to the crypto space.  ""I think about, 'What's the probability that the mainstream financial industry goes poof?'"" she continued, adding:  ""That's how I think about the asset allocation to bitcoin in my own portfolio. Specifically, what I mean by that is it's the settlement system risk that's the issue. I'm not talking about price risk. Obviously, bitcoin's more volatile than most traditional financial assets, but bitcoin is less volatile from a systemic perspective than I think the traditional financial industry is.”  Long spoke with CoinDesk for one of the inaugural episodes of Bitcoin Macro, a pop-up podcast featuring the speakers and themes of CoinDesk's upcoming Invest: NYC conference on Tuesday, Nov. 12.  Listen to the podcast here or read the whole transcript below.  The last six months have seen a growing dialogue between the bitcoin industry and the larger global macro community. No longer written off as some ignorable niche, increasingly people are asking: Is bitcoin a macro asset? Is it a safe-haven asset? How will it perform in the next recession?  After 20 years in corporate finance, Long began going to bitcoin meetups, eventually falling all the way down the rabbit hole and coming to provide a vital bridge for colleagues in both spaces. In particular, her leadership in Wyoming blazing a trail for pro-crypto, pro-innovation regulations serves as an example around the country and beyond.  In this episode of Bitcoin Macro, Nolan Bauerle sat down with Long to discuss:  Why she believes her early interest in bitcoin could have gotten her fired from Morgan Stanley.  Why bitcoin is a macro asset, but only for a very small niche (and why it isn’t ready for mainstream institutions just yet).  Why bitcoin isn’t likely to represent a safe haven asset in short-term blips – but could be powerful in the context of a major shock.  Why more traditional financial institutions are dipping their toes in, but only through VC and other risk structures (not through self-custody).  Why Wyoming is poised to do for the crypto industry what South Dakota did for the credit card industry.  Emerging issues with bitcoin lending.  Why the most interesting chart to Long is the bitcoin hashrate and the spread between household net worth and non-financial sector debt in the United States.      Nolan Bauerle: Welcome to Bitcoin Macro, a pop-up podcast produced as part of CoinDesk's Invest New York Conference in November. I'm your host, Nolan Bauerle. Both the podcast and the event explore the intersection of bitcoin and the global macroeconomy with perspectives from some of the leading thinkers in finance, crypto and beyond.  For this podcast, we're trying to do things a little bit differently, where we're going to create a series of questions for each of our speakers to really capture one of our themes and to highlight some of the subjects that will be on stage in November. This year's theme really is around bitcoin, how bitcoin is behaving in the world today given all of these circumstances that we're seeing in the global economy. Today, I'm joined by Caitlin Long, one of the most famous Wall Street defectors, refugees, I'm not sure what to call it.  Caitlin Long: Yep.  Nolan Bauerle: But certainly one of the most famous names to first enter the industry. So Caitlin Long is now in Wyoming doing important work over there to create, I think, a jurisdictional arbitrage I suppose we could call it for everyone in America to know that there is at least going to be one state that has exercised its rights to welcome this new form of finance into its borders. So, Caitlin, welcome. Thank you.  Caitlin Long: Thank you. It's great to be here.  Nolan Bauerle: Well, we're really excited. I mean, I have this idea that you can kind of get a sense of the history of Bitcoin by the human capital that started to be attracted to this industry. So, of course, it was the cypherpunks to start because this had been their project for a long time. And then there was a political slant. A lot of, let's say, libertarians or anarchocapitalists came along, and they were sort of generation two. The third generation, as far as I can tell that really jumped in two feet first, was Wall Street. It really was the first sort of non-sentimental group that joined. There wasn't really a large end game other than this trades, this is interesting, this is a finite digital resource, we can do stuff with this. I've never quite understood where you fit in that. So when and how was it that you turned towards this?  Caitlin Long: I think it was that second group. I found it through Austrian school economics circles even though I was working on Wall Street at the time. I kept my head down for fear of being fired at Bitcoin meetups and the like that I went to on my own time and dime after hours and on weekends. I learned a lot, but also just kept it very quiet that I was running a business at Morgan Stanley. I just didn't want that to break into the press at the time. That probably would've gotten me fired.  Nolan Bauerle: And a significant business at Morgan Stanley?  Caitlin Long: Well, yeah, it's a pension solutions group. I dealt with a lot of company plan sponsors of big pension funds, helped a lot of them settle, did big transactions for GM, and Verizon, and Bristol Myers Squibb, Motorola, et cetera. Through that, I got to really understand where the problems are in the mainstream financial system. I encountered them myself directly and figured out, not immediately... It took a little while for me to realize that this technology called blockchain was actually going to be the solution to a lot of those problems.  Eventually, I popped my head up and the chief technology officer of Morgan Stanley called me because he saw me on a Bitcoin forum. That was about 2014, so almost five years ago or so, and started working together to vet all of the startups that we're calling Morgan Stanley at the time. What was fascinating about it is he's a huge skeptic, and it was really helpful to me to work with somebody like that because it pushed me to become a better person in my own arguments. So far, we've both been right. Bitcoin hasn't died. It has become something. Institutions are coming into it, but he's also been right that this was all a lot slower than I think many of us anticipated in the early days.  Nolan Bauerle: Well, it sounds like the anti-fragility aspects of this technology that we love were added to your own understanding of it. So nothing wrong with being challenged and understanding how to solve other people's problems when they become your own when you understand more of them, when people bring them up. So to jump in now to the questions, we're really focused on how Bitcoin is behaving in today's global economy. So the first question is, is Bitcoin a macro asset?  Caitlin Long: Yes. But for a very small niche. It's uncorrelated. It has obviously very high volatility. It's not ready for prime time for big institutions just yet.  Nolan Bauerle: So the way I've been trying to frame this is we've got sort of the main stage of global finance, or global economics, and all the changes that we're seeing around us. So we've got this main stage. We've got people waiting in the wings to come onto the main stage and maybe some chorus singers in the background from the main part of the stage. Where would you put Bitcoin right now? Is it in the wings waiting to enter the main stage in global finance? Or is it a core singer who's already on stage, but we don't know what they're going to do yet?  Caitlin Long: Oh, it's definitely waiting in the wings. There's some very basic issues that I spotted as a former ERISA fiduciary. ERISA, as you may know, is the highest standard of care for institutional asset managers. ERISA fiduciaries have personal liability. I was personally sued as a fiduciary of Morgan Stanley's pension fund, named personally in a lawsuit. When that's your standard, you have to be very, very careful. Some of the basic things about Bitcoin need to be ironed out before it's ready for a ERISA prime time. For example, what's the exact legal status of the asset? Do I know I actually have clear legal title when I buy a Bitcoin? Obviously, if I have private keys, I know I possess it, but is a judge can recognize that?  And then obviously all of the custody issues surrounding it as well. It's not a security so there are a lot of folks, like Fidelity for example when it got into the custody business, did not pay homage to the phrase qualified custodian because only securities need to be held by a qualified custodian. But the reality is that the vast majority of investment managers are using custodians for everything. They're not set up to self-custody assets, so custody is a huge part of what needs to get solved before we start getting ERISA-level investors into this asset class, which I think is coming but we've got a few steps to get there first.  Nolan Bauerle: When you were talking about the ERISA aspect of it, I was unaware there was much skin in the game for a lot of people managing money on Wall Street. But apparently, this is an example of it.  Caitlin Long: Oh yeah. ERISA's a process statute. You have to ask the questions. It doesn't hold you, the fiduciaries, liable for the outcome. What it does is hold them liable for having examined all of the options. It's a process statute.  Nolan Bauerle: Got it. Got it. Got it. Within the context of some of the more volatile countries that we see in the world today, so we're even seeing that volatility come back to the renminbi with the recent devaluation. Is Bitcoin a safe-haven asset?  Caitlin Long: I think so. Obviously, Cyprus is the example of that where you see a so-called left-tail event, you see a real run on the financial system. That's the place where Bitcoin can really shine. I think that's coming in multiple iterations, but we're not there yet. We've just experienced the repo market meltdown related to the end of the third quarter for the big financial companies that have trouble funding themselves over the September 30th date. You know, Bitcoin actually traded down in the face of that. So it's not exhibiting in the short-term for what is probably a minor blip that's not going to be the big one, so to speak. Bitcoin isn't trading as a safe-haven asset, but if we hit a big one, that's when I think its day will really come.  Nolan Bauerle: When more of this modern monetary theory sort of takes hold and even more mistakes are made, perhaps that's the opportunity?  Caitlin Long: Yeah, absolutely. To me, it's an insurance against instability in the mainstream financial industry. I think about, ""What's the probability that the mainstream financial industry goes poof?"" That's how I think about the asset allocation to Bitcoin in my own portfolio. Specifically, what I mean by that is it's the settlement system risk that's the issue. I'm not talking about price risk. Obviously, Bitcoin's more volatile than most traditional financial assets, but Bitcoin is less volatile from a systemic perspective than I think the traditional financial industry is.  When we buy treasury bonds in our brokerage account, we don't own the treasury bonds. We own an IOU from our broker-dealer. So it's really the settlement risk that's the issue, and that's where I see there's tremendous instability. The left-tail risk is higher than we all think it is in the traditional financial sector. The severity, if it goes bust, is also extraordinarily high. So when I compare that to Bitcoin where I can own my asset outright taking 20% price volatility as an insurance policy to me doesn't feel like a bad trade-off at all.  Nolan Bauerle: Especially when you look at the, let's say there's much more of this coming. We've seen Argentina recently, so there we've already seen Bitcoin behave as a safe-haven asset simply because the options were so limited. In the United States, we saw this sort of liquidity crunch already before the 2008 meltdown. When these same signs were coming forward in 2006, there was these similar liquidity crunches. People were not able to get the kind of liquidity they required and very similar things were going on.  Of course, Satoshi Nakamoto, I've always believed that the Japanese pseudonym was really to have the kind of experience or authority to say to America that, ""What happened in Japan is now on your shores."" So where do you see some of those? What I mean by that, what happened to Japan in the last decade, they really are now addicted to quantitative easing. They're never going to get out of it. It doesn't look like they've got their demographic crunch going on, and Abenomics are just going to be the thing there. So I've always had it in my mind that what we were really hearing from, through the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto, was kind of a finger wag to say to America that, ""You actually broke your monetary policy leavers. Their broken. You can't use them anymore."" Do you see that continuing, and do you see Bitcoin being able to really thread the needle on this?  Caitlin Long: Oh, yes. The system broke in 2008, and we've been band-aiding it ever since then. In fact, actually this repo episode we were just talking about is the fourth such episodes since 2008. Now, the vast majority of people didn't even understand that because they're not watching the plumbing of the financial system. But it's very obvious that the plumbing in the financial system has been fundamentally broken since 2008, and the only reason that the system hasn't hit a wall yet is because it's been drugged with continued injections of liquidity, which is essentially just the central banks socializing losses, which is a problem because profits are privatized and losses are socialized in the traditional financial system. A lot of people have the right intuitive feel that that's unfair, and it is.  But I think that the challenge is that we don't know when this is going to come to a head. I look at one really important data point, which is, ""What's the household net worth in the United States relative to the total amount of non-financial sector debt?"" Right now, there's a spread between the two of several trillion dollars. That tells me that basically there's still balance sheet left in the United States for debt to still be piled onto the United States economy. That's why we haven't seen the financial system hit the wall yet. That's why interest rates are still higher in the U.S. and they are in other countries. When you see negative interest rates, it means there's no balance sheet left in that country. The only reason they haven't totally hit the wall yet is because the financial system is global and so interconnected, and the U.S. is carrying the rest of the world. But that U.S. balance sheet is going to get used up at some point, and that's likely when we see a regime change.  Nolan Bauerle: When I think of Bitcoin's behavior over the past few days, of course, this breaks the narrative a little bit. It's always been expected that Bitcoin, given these circumstances, would just perform. We've got a lot of rumors of or whispers of a recession. The same idea, there's a certain conviction that Bitcoin will behave well in a recession. In your opinion, what happens to Bitcoin in a recession given what we've seen in the past few days?  Caitlin Long: I think it totally depends on the severity of the recession. If it's just a blip... Like, we just talked about this is the fourth such repo episode, we didn't see Bitcoin correlate to strong performance in the previous ones because frankly, only financial market participants who were paying attention and the issues in the money markets didn't spill over into the mainstream economy. They are spilling into the mainstream economy now. But yet, as we start to see that this is the most severe such repo market episodes since 2008, will it come close to 2008? We don't know yet. It's not over at least in the short-term.  We're taping this on the Friday before quarter-end, before September 30th. It doesn't look like you're going to see a bank hit a wall before September 30th but to be clear, this was a pretty important, pretty painful episode. There was clearly a bank, or two, or more out there that wasn't going to be able to fund themselves past the end of the third quarter without an emergency bailout from the Fed, which is exactly what happened. Banks are supposed to be well-capitalized, right? The Fed, just in June, came out and talked about the resilience of the financial system and let all the big U.S. banks buy back stock and pay dividends. Now, three months later, the Fed's having to come to the rescue to inject cash into the system. It's obvious to me that the banks are under-capitalized still. I've known that for years, but we're just seeing yet another example playing that out.  Nolan Bauerle: It is a funny image, the idea of these large banks basically asking for overdraft protections from their bank. You can imagine the scene, it looks pretty ridiculous.  Caitlin Long: Yeah. Obviously, the Fed knows who it is. There are a lot of rumors in the marketplace, but at this point, the bank lived to fight another day and it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to hit a wall at some point. But you can look at the stock prices, particularly of the big European banks, where interest rates are negative and have been for quite some time. It's pretty obvious who some of the logical candidates are for funding problems. At some point, the balance sheet of the United States is not going to be able to carry the entire world on its shoulders.  Nolan Bauerle: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. That's an original take. I haven't heard that yet, but I see it the moment you mentioned it. Moving on to the next question, you're somewhat removed I would say from Wall Street these days given that you're committed to that wonderful project out in Wyoming. But I'm still curious if you've been able to pick up if the narrative around Bitcoin has changed within the main mainstream financial world over the last six months?  Caitlin Long: Sure. I still talk to a lot of folks on Wall Street, very much in touch with friends over the years. The answer is yes, but it's still folks who are dipping toes and getting off zero, as Pomp likes to say, are doing it in their venture portfolio allocation. This is high-risk stuff. This is not even any sort of significant allocation in portfolios. It's just a small allocation within the venture allocation, which is typically not that big anyway. So we're seeing toes dip into the water so far because of the timing of when some of those small pension funds got in that the returns have been amazing. But it's still not a mainstream thing, and it's all being done through VC structures. I'm not aware of any of the big pension funds that are directly buying in self-custody in Bitcoin. So far, that's only been hedge funds, and it's still not even that mainstream among hedge funds.  Nolan Bauerle: That, to me, sounds a lot like the, let's say, behavior of Bitcoin in mainstream financial world. Has there been any change in the way they might think about it? So that's not even about the commitment of any capital allocation. But if they said, ""Oh yeah, look, we saw this trade war between America and China erupt. Oh look, there was a lot of flow out of China in the OTC desks towards Bitcoin. Oh, I get it. That makes sense. There's this a way to hedge the devaluation over there in capital controls."" Is there stuff like that that people have said, ""Oh, it clicked""?  Caitlin Long: No. But I'll tell you what, they're doing for the personal portfolio. Again, when you're in a fiduciary asset management status, the asset managers don't have personal liability like an ERISA fiduciary does but they're fiduciary for their customer's assets. It's just not ready for prime time yet. I can't underscore enough how those basic issues that I mentioned earlier, being able to know definitively that you got clear legal title to the asset. That sounds so basic, but to be honest, the vast majority of law all around the world doesn't recognize digital assets and it doesn't fit into the traditional categories of commercial law. Commercial law is what I refer to as the base layer of the legal system. It tells you what the rights and obligations of parties to a commercial transaction are, and it gives a judge a roadmap for handling disputes.  Until you have that clarity, the vast majority of institutional investors just can't touch it from a fiduciary perspective. This is why Wyoming has done something really important because we've clarified those things, and we've also set up a digital asset custody regime that respects how Bitcoin works rather than trying to force it into the status quo of custody, which is... I've had all kinds of problems with it in my pension business. We can talk about if you're interested in hearing, but the gist is Wyoming's actually solving these basic issues and it's the only place within the United States.  My personal bet, part of the reason I moved back here from the New York area this summer, is we're going to end up in Wyoming what South Dakota is to the credit card industry. South Dakota grabbed the entire credit card industry away from New York State in the early 1980s because New York had a very low cap on its usury rates under New York law that it was not willing to change. South Dakota, when interest rates and short-term rates went to 21% in under the Volcker Fed, South Dakota said, ""We'll take our usury law cap off. Come out and head to South Dakota. You're welcome here."" Forty years later, we've got in South Dakota, 16,000 jobs. That's the same is going to be true in Wyoming if this plays out the way I hope and actually think it will. This is going to be the home of digital-asset custody.  Nolan Bauerle: Yeah. When you mentioned that point about the law, what I find so strange is that the purpose of common law really is that people are free to contract. I'm free to say this thing has value, and you're free to come up with a price. That's all are just basic rights. It does become strange that this isn't easily recognized. Even stranger still, when I was looking at some of the way the Chinese... I mean, I would never recommend anything about how the Chinese regime has dealt with Bitcoin. However, when it came to the OTC trades, they said something interesting. They said, ""Look, this is property and a person is free to destroy their own property and do what they wish with their property."" They said, ""Therefore, we cannot stop any OTC trading of a thing that we recognize as property."" It's funny that of all places, China came up with probably the most common law interpretation of Bitcoin. I find that remarkable for the strangest reasons.  Caitlin Long: Yeah, that's interesting. I didn't realize that, but Wyoming did something similar. It's logical. This is property. But, how do you fit it into existing categories of property? Is it money? Is it a security? Is it something else? Is it a commodity? So the point is until you actually have mapped these assets, specifically Bitcoin, to exist in commercial law categories, you don't know definitively in a dispute how it's going to be treated. I'll tell you, one of the biggest compliments that I got for the work we're doing in Wyoming was from a big institutional investor who reached out and said, ""We aren't touching Bitcoin until we know definitively that we're not going to end up in a lien mess.""  The issue is that when people are lending Bitcoin, which, of course, is happening right and left now... We've got a number of coin-lending companies that are basically paying interest for people to deposit their Bitcoin. How are they doing that? Because, obviously, there's no interest. But in the Bitcoin system, it's because they're lending it out for a spread on the other side. Right? So the issue is that there is a lien being created on that asset, and how do you know when you buy it that you're buying it free and clear of any other liens because you can't track the liens on the Bitcoin blockchain?  In fact, in the OTC markets, the Coinbase coins that comes directly from the miners trade at a premium. I think there are two reasons for that. One is that they're clear from an anti-money laundering and OFAC-type perspective and you know that they've never got to [inaudible 00:23:31] or a sanctioned country like North Korea for example. But I think the other one is this point that we're talking about. No one likes to talk about it because it's boring and it makes your head explode, but it's a really important point.  It gets back to this issue of, ""How do I know I have clean title? How do I know that somebody's not going to come back to me and say, 'The coin lending company sold you that Bitcoin that was subject to a lien? It's mine.'"" A judge is going to look at that and they're going to say, ""Yeah, that lien was valid and you have to give it up."" This is why an institution cannot afford to take risks like this. Until they know they have a jurisdiction where it's clear that they are able to take clean title... Believe it or not, there's litigation in Wyoming already. There have been a couple of court cases. We're starting to get some of the legal clarity, not just with the statute, but also the litigation in Wyoming that's going to give institutional investors comfort to come in here.  Nolan Bauerle: Yeah, I really never had considered the full depth of an obstacle that liens would have with all the lending. That is true.  Caitlin Long: Oh, yeah.  Nolan Bauerle: There's large volumes, over a billion in 2018, the last time I saw a full-year resume of what had gone and I'm sure it's more this year. So that's an important part of the industry already. Interesting.  Caitlin Long: The person who reached out to me was from a significant hedge fund, and this was five years ago. So they had identified this five years ago as an issue and stayed out of it for that reason.  Nolan Bauerle: Wow. Wow. Interesting stuff.  Caitlin Long: Yeah.  Nolan Bauerle: Well, you brought us to our last question, a chart, or a data point, or a trend that illustrates your current belief in Bitcoin's behavior in this market?  Caitlin Long: Well, the highest correlation of Bitcoin price is to its hash rate, and we continue to see the hash power coming into the network. As long as that's up and to the right, the general price trend for Bitcoin is going to continue to be up and to the right. Obviously, there are daily fluctuations, but that's the chart that I pay the most attention to. At a macro level, if I could throw in one other, it's the chart I referred to earlier which is the spread between household net worth and non-financial sector debt in the United States. As long as that stays positive, then interest rates are likely to continue to be above zero in the U.S. and we still have balance sheet to carry the rest of the world. But we're adding another $2.5-3 trillion a year on financial sector debt in U.S. dollars, and we're eating into that spread pretty rapidly.  Nolan Bauerle: That is a large amount. Yeah, you bring up the hash rate and it certainly did a signal this week's price dip. That really crashed on Monday. I noticed that and hadn't really tied the two together in my mind yet. But thanks for doing that.  Caitlin Long: It is fascinating though because that was not a withdrawal of hash rate. The way that that's calculated is it's probability-based in the sense that when you have a very long time to propagate a block, the hash rate looks like it's crashing even though the hash power in the network hasn't been withdrawn. That incident was entirely within the probability of Bitcoin. I haven't seen an analysis of how many standard deviations around the 10-minutes average block appending time. But it was an unusual situation, but it was not a flaw in the Bitcoin network. It's just one of those low probability but entirely foreseeable events.  Nolan Bauerle: Like, what you're saying is basically the hash rate was wrestling with the difficulty rate more than it had been over the last little while?  Caitlin Long: Yeah. And I'm not the right person to–  Nolan Bauerle: Therefore, propagating time's a little higher.  Caitlin Long: If propagation time was higher, yeah. I'm not the right person to explain it. Luckily, I was around some core developers who were talking about it. This wasn't a cause for alarm, no question, but yet the press reported it as if it were. This was something that was entirely foreseeable. Bitcoin, as you know, is a probability-based system so when you get something that's a several standard deviation event, you can't say that that wasn't foreseeable and you can't say that that there are fundamental problems in the system. It's going to happen periodically, and it has happened before. It just hasn't happened with as many people looking at it as happened this week.  Nolan Bauerle: Interesting stuff, Caitlin.

42403426,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfwnP,1571930111,PODCAST: Nic Carter on Bitcoin's Evolution as a Safe-Haven Asset,"“If you are fleeing a country with just the clothes on your back and you want to take your savings with you, bitcoin is an excellent kind of safe haven,” said Nic Carter, founding partner of Castle Island Ventures.  “You’re happy to tolerate some of that exchange risk for the duration of the period in exchange for being able to store your savings in 12 phrases in your brain,” Carter added, continuing:  “From that perspective, it's a great safe haven. But for a global macro allocator that cares about correlations and volatility, maybe it's not as good, but it's a lot of things to different people. It's kind of a heterogeneous asset.”  Carter spoke with CoinDesk for one of the inaugural episodes of Bitcoin Macro, a pop-up podcast featuring the speakers and themes of CoinDesk's upcoming Invest: NYC conference on Tuesday, Nov. 12.  Listen to the podcast here or read the whole transcript below.  The last six months have seen a growing dialogue between the bitcoin industry and the larger global macro community. No longer written off as some ignorable niche, increasingly people are asking: Is bitcoin a macro asset? Is it a safe-haven asset? How will it perform in the next recession?  Nic Carter is one of the most broad and heterodox thinkers in the bitcoin space. He learns in the open, shares what he thinks (whether it matches what the broader community wants him to think), is willing to change his mind, and always comes back to data.  In this episode, Coindesk’s strategy chief Nolan Bauerle chats with Carter about:  Why bitcoin is undeniably related to the larger political and economic climate.  Why the emergence of Libra piqued the interest of central banks and sovereigns in bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry more broadly.  Why bitcoin’s status as a safe haven asset is highly correlated to the specific political and economic context of the holder.  Why the fact that everyone is expecting a recession means that we might not get a traditional recession.  Japan as a rebuttal to the idea that the stock market always goes up  The type of behind-the-scenes questions previously crypto-green institutions are starting to ask about bitcoin data, valuation and more.  The power inherent in the fact that anyone with an internet connection can start to exit their local currency system.  Why the realized capital of bitcoin is at an all-time high, even if market cap is far off.      Nolan Bauerle: Welcome to Bitcoin Macro, a pop-up podcast produced as part of the CoinDesk Invest New York conference in November. I'm your host, Nolan Bauerle. Both the podcast and the event explore the intersection of Bitcoin and the global macroeconomy with perspectives from some of the leading thinkers and finance, crypto and beyond.  I'm here with Nic Carter, the founder of the data site Coin Metrics, a VC with Castle Island Ventures, a founder of that firm. And who was also Abby Johnson's personal advisor on Bitcoin for quite a while before he stepped out into the entrepreneurial game. So everyone in the industry knows you, Nic. So I'm not going to spend too, too much time on your background other than that. This series of podcasts that CoinDesk is running in its lead up to Consensus Invests in November, seeks to bring some of our speakers together to answer a few questions about Bitcoin in the world today. These questions are really focused around its behavior on the global scene and in the global economy. And Nic, who has been working at this stuff for quite a while now, is one of the best people we could possibly get to participate in this podcast. So I'll jump right in with the first question, Nic. Is Bitcoin a macro asset?  Nic Carter: Well, first of all, thanks for having me on the show, Nolan. I really appreciate that. On the macro asset front, I guess it really depends on your definition of sort of a global macro asset. To the extent that global macro is a strategy that involves kind of forecasting geopolitical trends and trading on that basis. I would say, absolutely. Some people would try and say, ""Well Bitcoin isn't big enough to be considered eligible to be a macro asset, which I think is a little silly. If you look at the, there's a really great set of data compiled by the guys over at Crypto Voices and they try and measure Bitcoin against other base monies, not against M3 or M2, but against just the base money.  And they find that it's something like the 11th largest compared to sovereign currencies and gold and silver. By their measure, Bitcoin is the 11th largest kind of base money in the world. So I would say, it's absolutely something of significance, even in its relatively small state and I think it totally, it's buffeted by sort of political wins. And it's also potentially, it's emergence is also a response to some things that are going on in the world with central banks. So while it doesn't really have any meaningful correlation to really any other financial assets out there. I would say it's totally a macro asset.  Nolan Bauerle: If I was to sort of translate what you're saying, from my point of view, you could really swap out the words macroeconomics for politics. I mean they're quite similar. We're really talking about the politics, right? And there's no doubt that Bitcoin is political.  Nic Carter: For sure.  Nolan Bauerle: Which I suppose, de-facto raises it up to the level of being a macro asset because that's the whole point.  Nic Carter: It's sort of always had political goals, but sovereigns haven't really cared about it until now. So if anything, that's the interesting thing about the year 2019. Maybe the emergence of Libra as well really piqued the interest of a lot of central banks. And they started to realize that cryptocurrencies and non-sovereign currencies were actually a meaningful trend and we're not going to go away anytime soon.  Nolan Bauerle: And bringing us back to the world of private issuance of money that was so prevalent before the federal reserve in 1912 and was really common in the United States for 100 years before that.  Nic Carter: Absolutely, yeah, private money is and was the historical default and it's only been a relatively short period of time that we've been on this latest kind of monetary regime. So you could say this is actually kind of a reversion to the mean.  Nolan Bauerle: So with all of this, I guess you could say uncertainty. We've seen bitcoin behave in certain ways. So we can define it as a macro asset, fine because of what's around it, but its behavior really would push it into the threshold of whether or not it's a safe haven asset. From its behavior, have you seen it behave as a safe haven asset, given all of the sort of tribulations we're seeing today?  Nic Carter: Safe is probably in the eye of the beholder or the eye of the holder, I guess, to make a labored pun. So assets I would consider traditional safe havens are like treasuries, maybe gold, maybe the Swiss Franc, actual cash, the dollar, most of those things are pretty stable. Bitcoin's realized volatility is many multiples of the most volatile of all those, which is gold. So just from a data perspective, it's probably not behaving in purchasing power terms like the other traditional safe-haven assets. So my official answer on that is, we don't have enough data yet. Bitcoin's only really been financialized for a couple of years. Insufficient data for a meaningful answer.  Nolan Bauerle: Safe haven to those who have no other recourse, I suppose.  Nic Carter: Yeah, so that was going to be the second part. If you are fleeing a country with just the clothes on your back and you want to take your savings with you, Bitcoin is an excellent kind of safe haven and you're happy to tolerate some of that exchange risk for the duration of the period in exchange for being able to store your savings in a 12 phrase, in your brain. From that perspective, it's a great safe haven. But for a global macro allocator that cares about correlations and volatility, maybe it's not as good, but it's a lot of things to different people. It's kind of a heterogeneous asset.  Nolan Bauerle: We've I guess you could say rumors of a real recession coming to America. We'll see if it actually plays out. But of course, Bitcoin was predicted by a lot of people within the Bitcoin world to be a hedge against that. Do you think that Bitcoin can behave in such a way given conditions around our a recession or do you think it could start mimicking other assets in that environment?  Nic Carter: It's definitely hard to know. My intuition is that as it gets more integrated into financial markets, it'll eventually come to be more correlated to traditional financial assets. Right now we realize correlations are still pretty close to zero. Although there has been some indications over the last six, 12 months that it's co-moving with gold to some small degree. Bitcoin is not at its terminal stage of growth yet. It's still, I would say fairly early in its life cycle. So it's just growing endogenously and it will continue to do so, in my opinion. So the real price drivers are almost to some degree, internal.  What I'm trying to say really is that I think the main things that cause bitcoin's price to grow is very much a function of its stage of development and the various thresholds it's hitting, in terms of growth and infrastructure, adoption. I don't think its price is really going to be driven much by macro factors. For a while, whether it will outperform in a recession, is very hard to know. Some people have talked about an inflationary versus deflationary recession and it sort of depends what kind we get.  It's plausible to me that the US just undergoes kind of a Japanification, whereby you have extremely loose monetary policy, even looser than we have today. In an effort to kind of stave off any downturn whatsoever. And where the stock market turns into a political utility, if it hasn't already. And we just have an extended period of stagnation. That may well be the case, I know everyone's expecting a recession right now, which makes me think maybe we're not going to get a classic recession.  Nolan Bauerle: I sort of have fallen into this speculative point in this podcast twice in a row now. But I've always been of the mind that the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym was really to have the type of experience or authority to say, ""Look what happened in Japan in the 1990s."" And if you go back to the context of 2008 and what was going on then. Sort of a finger wag to say, ""Look, it's now here.""  You've copied those exact conditions and you will now be perpetually stuck with a broken monetary policy lever and you can't pull on it anymore. And so you're going to have to print money and you're going to have to do along the lines of what you just mentioned, a Japanification of your economy. Is that what you've seen over the last 10 years? Is that where you see things continuing to go?  Nic Carter: I would be shocked if the Fed did anything other than continue on its current trajectory, which does sort of indicate that we would be going for more of an Abenomics, Japanese approach to a demographic slow down and just the end of the high growth era. It's really funny though, I haven't heard that theory for the Satoshi pseudonym before. It's pretty good though.  Nolan Bauerle: Yeah, I remember reading it somewhere, honestly in 2012 or 2013 and I have never been able to find the source. But maybe I dreamt it. I don't know where I got it from, but I have been operating under that assumption since 2012. So maybe I'm crazy, I don't know.  Nic Carter: I like the Japan case study, though, because it's always a good rebuttal to the people that claim that the stock market always goes up in real terms. There's this real cult of passive investing with the idea that the stock market will just reliably return 8 percent nominal, 6 percent real every year in perpetuity. I think that's asinine. And if you look at the Nikkei, I think it peaked in something like 1985 maybe and you just about broke even not too long ago if you'd held the Nikkei from 85 to present, which is a great rebuttal to this notion that growth is permanent and the stock market always goes up.  Nolan Bauerle: And there are some pretty troubling qualities of the, let's say traders and investors using then Nikkei, it's not as deep as it once was, that's for sure.  Nic Carter: And the BOJ owns a significant attraction as well, which is like, it seems to be a total distortion of the market.  Nolan Bauerle: Mm-hmm (affirmative), Mm-hmm (affirmative), to make sure it keeps rising.  Nic Carter: Yeah, it's a market for these utilities.  Nolan Bauerle: So, Nic, you've had the pleasure and I think the good opportunity earlier in your career to spend a lot of time with I guess what we consider real Wall Street players, really the mainstream financial world was kind of where you got your start in this. Definitely working on cryptocurrencies, but within that environment at your time at Fidelity. And I'm wondering now in your position with the VC that you founded, if you still are able to gather the narrative that the mainstream financial world has around Bitcoin and if you've noticed any change in the last six months.  Nic Carter: I think Fidelity was probably a special case in that they were very heterodox in their thinking, relative to the kind of traditional Wall Street firms. I was very, very lucky to start my career there or my second career maybe or my financial career there. They were already primed to be super open-minded to cryptocurrency when I joined because they'd spent several years, starting in 2014, educating themselves on the industry, on Bitcoin. And to some degree, I think all of the big firms, all of the big financial firms that engage with this stuff need to go through that fairly long cycle of learning before they're ready to sort of productively engage.  And whilst they're still in the midst of that, you see things like these permission blockchain initiatives, which don't seem particularly interesting to me at least. So my experience is a little bit colored by having been dropped into that already very open-minded environment. But I try and keep my finger on the pulse and talk to my friends that work with hedge funds, traditional allocators. I will say there's been a bit more openness to cryptocurrencies as an asset class. This is also been the experience of the folks at Coin Metrics and very close to, they're noticing traditional institutions that aren't publicly known to have any allocation or engagement with cryptocurrency at all.  They're starting to ask about the data. They're trying to get smart about how to value bitcoin or at least what maybe the drivers of its price are or what the usage of the network is and other kinds of top cryptocurrencies. So I definitely have noticed a bit of a shift. I think in 2017, institutions for the most part, were very unwilling to engage. There was the big issue with custody, market structure wasn't fully understood and there's still a lot of regulatory questions.  Nolan Bauerle: And a lot of assets to be careful about.  Nic Carter: Of course, yeah and I mean we actually haven't seen much of that uncertainty resolved because the SEC has been really standoffish in terms of doing anything about the ITOs. A few of those boxes have been checked in the last couple of years. And I think also in 2017 there was a perception, a correct perception, that it was a heavily retail-driven market and no one really wants to be buying the perceived top, in a market that's very retail-driven. And I think that's changed as well. So there's kind of a growing awareness, I think a lot of what the Wall Street institutions are doing these days is a lot more definitive in terms of acknowledging that cryptocurrencies are real and here to stay.  I also think Libra's announcement kind of moved the needle a lot. People really take Facebook seriously and Facebook, for all their flaws, were very earnest in their desire to create a new unit of account, a new non-state money, even if it looks to be rather centralized and problematic in some ways. But the fact that they had been messaging that they would be piggybacking on the infrastructure, which has been built for cryptocurrencies over the last decade, that kind of validates what we've been doing here, to some degree. Even if it's a corporation that I'm not a huge fan of, which is Facebook.  Nolan Bauerle: But it certainly ionized or has the potential to ionize a huge swath of the global population into the Bitcoin world. So I think that, that definitely got a lot of people paying attention.  Nic Carter: Totally, I think the jury's still out on whether Libra would be a net good or not if it launched. If there were some provisions to preserve user privacy, it could well be a net good. I know that's going to be a bit of a controversial opinion, but if given the choice to hold your savings and like the Indian rupee or the Nigerian naira or mostly dollar-backed Libra basket, which undoubtedly would preserve purchasing power better.  A lot of people would choose the latter and I think the effective outcome of that would be to kind of dollarize a lot of these developing world countries. Which is actually sort of hostile to the local governments and the local currencies. So that's another reason why I'm skeptical Libra would actually launch. But it's always nice to have another option, whether that's a somewhat permission coin like Libra or a preferable, in my view, something like Bitcoin.  Nolan Bauerle: But certainly it goes back to what you mentioned at the very beginning about the private money sort of reentering the scene and becoming the norm again. I mean, isn't that what it's all about? Isn't it about that? Maybe this power of minting money and borrowing and all that. Maybe it's inappropriate in general, which is what they were talking about back in 1912 when the fed was set up anyway. I mean those were the conversations they were having then. This power should not be given to politicians, who can't see past their reelection.  Nic Carter: Yeah, whether the algorithm is maybe one day Facebook would use their vast trove of data to pick some sort of non-discretionary algorithm for managing the money supply, which would be interesting. Or maybe we'll just have the very simple algorithm, which is bitcoin's kind of asymptotic issuance, which eventually ends. The constant there is the ending of monetary discretion, which a lot of people have identified as this kind of ironically pro-cyclical force, even though it's intended to manage the kind of boom-bust cycle of recessions.  I think in practice it's done the opposite and it's made them more intense and more destructive. So a lot of bitcoiners think absolutely no discretion whatsoever and capped issuance is the way. Maybe there'll be another algorithm which emerges, which is more popular, but it's sharing to me that for the first time in a long time, normal folks, all they need is an internet connection and they can fully or partially exit their local currency system.  Nolan Bauerle: So Nic, we're coming to the end, our last question of this interesting conversation and you're a data guy. You're known in the industry as a data guy. The service that you provide the industry with Coin Metrics, the free downloads, which I use regularly. And the more elaborate stuff, which here at CoinDesk we've piped into a long time ago because it is top, top quality. But you're also known for coming up with all these great new ways of understanding Bitcoin's behavior from a trading perspective. So what's one chart or trend that you're really looking at right now that really has your attention? Other than the ones that you're creating yourself or I suppose you can actually come up with and I mention one of your own, if you don't mind.  Nic Carter: You know one thing I've been paying a lot of attention to lately would be this notion of realized capitalization, which was devised as kind of an alternative to market capitalization. What you do is, you take the price at which each unit of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency of your choice last changed hands and you add all those up. So instead of pricing all of the supply at current market price, you actually look and determine where each last Bitcoin actually traded and settled on the ledger and you add it all up.  And so you get, actually most of the time it's a much more conservative view of market cap. And the interesting thing is the realized cap and Bitcoin just passed $100 billion, whereas market cap is somewhere like 150 160 billion I haven't checked. And it's actually at an all-time high compared with market cap, which is well below its all-time high. And one way that I think about realized cap is that it measures, roughly speaking, the average cost basis of your average holder.  Nolan Bauerle: It almost sounds like a blend of days destroyed and huddle waves. Like you're getting both of the good effects of those metrics and sort of seeing it blended together.  Nic Carter: Yeah, the intuition is kind of similar for sure. Which is why don't we develop a measure of economic significance, which is at least in part, indexed to the actual usage of the ledger, which is transparent. And a lot of people say that the transparency of Bitcoin is this bug and it's terrible. And I mean it's true when it comes to individual privacy for sure. But it's also a feature when it comes to evaluating the economic nature of these things. And in the case of realized cap, it allows us to determine with a good degree of precision, where the market in the aggregate actually bought into their current positions. So it's pretty fascinating to watch. And what it shows to me is that for the most part, Bitcoin holders are actually in profit because very little Bitcoin changed hands at those a really extreme heights back in 2017. And for the most part, your average holder obtained their positions at a lower threshold.  Nolan Bauerle: Fascinating stuff, Nic and looking forward to you joining us in November in New York City for Consensus Invest, where you'll be speaking about more data.  Nic Carter: That's right. Looking forward to it as well. Thanks for having me on.  Nolan Bauerle: Thanks a ton.  Enjoyed this episode? I'd like to personally invite you to come to Invest New York in November.

Speaking onstage at a Vanity Fair event  , Armstrong said Coinbase has turned a profit the last three years – including during the 2018 bear market – and has earned more operating profit than venture capital raised to date, estimated at nearly $550 million in nine funding rounds, according to CrunchBase. The firm is currently valued at $8 billion.  “Most of these profits we're plowing back into the business to create new products,” Armstrong told Vanity Fair. “I sort of think of us as the anti-unicorn unicorn... I want Coinbase to be a company of repeatable innovation.”  Commenting on the current regulatory environment, Armstrong said reactions against Facebook and other crypto innovations are puzzling:  “I don’t really know why the reaction was so negative. I’d really like to see the U.S. embrace this area of innovation.""  Armstong added:  “There are a lot of people who are unbanked in the world, who are underbanked… My hope is the U.S. embraces this kind of innovation, even if it comes from a company like Facebook that they’re not necessarily very happy with.”  The exchange has recently expanded its European ventures as well, procuring an Irish e-money license from the Central Bank of Ireland earlier this month.

42403410,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfvMr,1571914807,Bitcoin Eyes First Test of $7.2K Price Support Since April,"View  A high-volume range breakdown seen on the daily chart suggests scope for test of a long-term moving average at $7,200. A violation there would expose another major average support at $7,000.  A corrective bounce above resistance at $7,534 could be seen before a deeper drop, as the intraday charts are reporting oversold conditions.  A lagging indicator suggests BTC may bottom out in the range of $7,000 to $7,200.  A UTC close above the Oct. 21 high of $8,352 is needed to confirm a bullish reversal.  Long-term bitcoin price support at $7,200 may be put to test for the first time in six months, likely after a minor price bounce.  The crypto market leader fell by $500 to $7,500 during the U.S. trading hours on Wednesday, confirming a downside break of the recent trading range of $7,800 to $8,400.  Prices went on to hit a five-month low of $7,293 before printing a UTC close at $7,470 – down 6.92 percent on the day, according to Bitstamp data. That's the biggest single-day drop since Sept. 24, when prices had declined by 11.83%.  The range breakdown indicates the sell-off from highs above $10,000 seen on Sept. 23 has resumed and prices could test support at $7,200 – the 100-period moving average on the three-day chart. That MA line was last put to test at the end of April.  The drop to the key support, however, may be preceded by a minor corrective bounce, as the intraday chart indicators are reporting oversold conditions.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,470 on Bitstamp, representing a 46 percent loss from 2019's high of $13,880 registered on June 26. That said, the cryptocurrency is still reporting a 100 percent gain on a year-to-date basis and is the best performing asset of 2019.  Daily and 3-day charts  Wednesday's range breakdown (above left) is backed by an uptick in trading volumes to the highest level since Sept. 26 and looks to have legs.  The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has dived below the ascending trendline, invalidating the bullish divergence confirmed on Oct. 6. A failed bullish divergence is widely considered as a powerful bearish signal.  As a result, the cryptocurrency appears on track to test the three-day chart 100-candle MA at $7,200 (above right). A violation there would expose the 200-candle MA, currently located just below $7,000.  The sell-off may stall around the aforementioned crucial support levels, as the 50- and 200-day moving averages (MAs) are about to produce a death cross – a bearish, but a lagging indicator, which trapped sellers on the wrong side of the market in April 2018 and September 2015.  Hourly and 4-hour charts  The RSIs on the hourly and 4-hour charts are reporting oversold conditions with a below-30 print. So, a corrective bounce cannot be ruled out.  The former support-turned-resistance of $7,714 (Sept. 30 low) could come into play if the immediate resistance at $7,534 (horizontal line on hourly) is scaled in the next 24 hours.  The outlook would turn bullish if and when prices rise above the Oct. 20 high of $8,352, invalidating the bearish lower highs setup on the daily chart.

Both groups of investors in Telegram’s twin $850 million funding rounds have now agreed to accept extensions for the Telegram Open Network launch following the Oct. 23 deadline.  An email sent to one group of investors and obtained by CoinDesk reads:  ""We are happy to share with you that we have successfully obtained the consent of a significant majority of investors in both the Pre-Sale and Stage A to extend the deadline for the Network Launch to 30 April 2020. We would like to thank everyone for your support. This extension allows us to proceed with the necessary regulatory work described in our last e-mail.""  The offer to accept the extension was sent to TON investors a week after the SEC’s Oct. 11 injunction claiming the gram token is a security.  Under the terms of the agreement, a majority of ICO investors would either agree to extend the token issuance date or receive 77 percent of their initial investment back. Each investor cohort had to agree as well, meaning one group could have been refunded while the other held onto the promise of gram tokens. The issuance of the token is now slated for April 30, 2020.  ""We voted to wait, although we're sure Telegram will not be able to clear things with the SEC,"" one of the TON investors told CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity.  He predicted that TON will launch, but lose the battle with the regulators and, as a result, lose huge markets such as the U.S., Russia, China and possibly some European countries. However, as a first-round investor who bought grams at 37 cents apiece, he still hopes to make money on the investment:  ""There is a chance that we will get more than we would receive if Telegram just returned out investment, and, at the end, we didn't invest that much.""  The terms of the agreement also include that Telegram can spend another $80 million of the ICO funding. The seventh month period will be used to further develop the TON ecosystem, according to the company.  An Oct. 24 court hearing on the question of gram being a security was also postponed till February 18–19. In a letter to investors sent out on Oct. 21, Telegram called the delay a positive development that will give it time to prepare its case:  ""The February hearings are different from the earlier scheduled for October 24, because at these hearings they should only consider the possible postponement of the launch of the platform. We and our advisers will use the time to ensure that at the February hearing, the Telegram position is presented and supported as much as possible.""

42403401,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfvEz,1571911227,Colorado Could Be Next in the Race to Bank Crypto (and Cannabis),"The Takeaway:  Members of Colorado's Blockchain Coincil have begun the process of creating special-purpose banking legislation to cater to crypto companies.  The aim is to get a bill in front of Colorado lawmakers by December.  Additionally, Colorado is exploring the option of extending crypto-specific banking laws (similar to those passed in Wyoming) in order to cater to the underbanked cannabis industry.  Colorado is proposing a joint initiative with Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona and others to bring blockchain legislation to the attention of federal lawmakers.      Colorado could be the next Wyoming.  Following the Cowboy State’s passage of 13 blockchain-friendly laws earlier this year, its neighbor to the south is now looking to help crypto companies get bank accounts.  Earlier this month, former members of Colorado's Blockchain Council convened the first meeting of a working group focused on legislation to authorize the creation of special-purpose banking institutions in the state. Colorado’s Office of Economic Development & International Trade (OEDIT) assisted the group.  To some degree, the proposed bill will likely emulate the Special Purpose Depository Institutions (SPDI) law passed in Wyoming. Indeed, thanks to Wyoming’s work on blockchain legislation, Colorado (and other U.S. states) can save time and effort by perusing 200 pages of legislation, chock-full of banking complexity.  Colorado’s new special banking working group continues the work done over the last 12 months by the Colorado Blockchain Council. In March, Colorado signed its Digital Token Act, also similar to Wyoming’s token law.  To be sure, Colorado’s proposed crypto-banking bill has some lawmaker support. Backing the initiative, State Sen. Jack Tate told CoinDesk in an email:  “My sense is that we will continue to support blockchain industry growth in the Colorado economy while at the same time look within our own government sector for practical blockchain applications that warrant funding.”  Off to the races  The enactment of multiple state laws around crypto is good for everyone, but clearly there’s a bit of competition between states.  One attendee at Colorado’s first SPDI group meeting said his impression was it might “steal Wyoming’s thunder.”  The Colorado banking group’s roadmap was set out with military precision, according to Joseph Pitluck, CEO of FreeRange, which helps banks and trust companies manage digital assets. He told CoinDesk:  “I think Wyoming is going to be surprised. Colorado has a pretty impressive timeline for the SPDI to try and get everything lined up by December. It was less an informal discussion and more like invasion plans being drawn up, like a D-Day landing or something. They are very organized and pretty serious contenders.”  New Mexico is also looking at ways to get SPDI legislation to pass as quickly as possible, said Pitluck. New Mexico’s Legislative Council is busy drafting a version of the Wyoming bill with a view to having a hearing in mid-November, according to New Mexico House Commerce Committee chair Antonio Maestas.  In the case of Colorado, Eric Kintner, a partner at law firm Snell & Wilmer and the co-chair of Colorado’s SPDI working group said they had to “boil it down to a bi-weekly schedule to get a marker down by December.”  In terms of timelines, Kintner told CoinDesk:  “The legislature then meets for five months and this may have to go through a couple of committees because it involves banking. So we would be looking at about the end of next year.”  Not so fast  However, former Wall Street executive Caitlin Long, the gubernatorial appointee to the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force, pointed out that it took Colorado two, 120-day legislative sessions to pass its utility token law.  The SPDI is a much heavier lift, she said, particularly when factoring in the incumbent banking system. Long told CoinDesk:  “I wish Colorado luck but I am very skeptical that they will be able to pull it off. A big reason is the incumbent banking system, which was a big obstacle to us in Wyoming and is much stronger in Colorado than it was in Wyoming.”  Kintner said he was “cautiously optimistic” when it comes to the state’s bankers. The Colorado Bankers Association has been attending Blockchain Council meetings, Kintner said.  “They have concerns that will have to be addressed,"" he said, ""but I don't have a sense that they are completely opposed to it.”  Stepping back, there are various cultural and economic factors at play here. In contrast to Colorado, Wyoming is a small state with less in the way of taxes to collect. Wyoming also has a history of blazing a trail with commercially focused and innovative laws, such as the Limited Liability Company Act back in the late 1970s. Some in Wyoming feel the state lost out to other states like Delaware on LLC innovation and are keen to retain a lead with blockchain.  “Maybe they [Wyoming] need to find ways to raise revenue and they view crypto as maybe a cottage industry that might set up shop there,” said Kintner. “Maybe that works and maybe that doesn't; I don’t know. But I don’t view this process as necessarily having to be competitive one where only one state will benefit.”  Looking ahead, Kintner even suggested a joint initiative among the likes of Wyoming, New Mexico and Arizona, to pull together with a view to being heard at the federal level.  Said Kintner:  “One of the areas that we are focused on is trying to convene kind of regional conferences where like a front range conference, so Congress will realize Wyoming and New Mexico and Arizona and Colorado all have this so why don't we look at it at more federal level.""  Cannabis economy  Colorado has experience when it comes to creating a concerted push for federal law changes with its flourishing cannabis industry. And at the state level, the SPDI group is exploring whether it can service both the unbankable crypto realm as well as its chronically underbanked cannabis industry.  OEDIT Program Director Jana Persky told CoinDesk:  “We are specifically asking for industries like cannabis to get involved in this working group. Right now it’s hard to say what the actual solution will be, but we are actively working to bring members of the cannabis industry into the conversation to try and find a solution that benefits as many people as possible.”  Similar to crypto, cannabis companies inhabit a regulatory lacuna and struggle to get banking services. Colorado’s cannabis industry has been hamstrung between state and federal law for some years now, and has evolved to the point that over 30 banks and credit unions quietly provide services to the multibillion-dollar industry, according to the Colorado Bankers Association.  Meanwhile, the Secure And Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, designed to legally bank cannabis companies at the level of federal regulation, has been passed by the U.S. House and lobbyists expect there is a good chance it will go through the Senate and be signed by the end of this year.  On the subject of cannabis and blockchain potentially overlapping, Tate, the state senator, told CoinDesk:  “It’s not necessarily overlap – it's just that those two industries face similar circumstances. ... I think there is a general intellectual curiosity as to how the marijuana industry is challenged as compared to blockchain businesses, but ultimately our group is focused on blockchain technology.""  The cannabis industry is not only more mature than crypto, but the financial stakes are also higher, said Kintner.  “On the face of it,” Kintner said, an SPDI bill like the one created in Wyoming for crypto might work for cannabis too. But another consideration on the table for Colorado is lending, which would be a very different animal from the Wyoming SPDI: the latter is non-lending and not FDIC insured, requiring crypto businesses to hold reserves of cash equal to 100 percent of their deposits.  “We are not sure whether it should be something like Wyoming has done or something totally different,"" said Kintner. ""It’s an open question right now whether this [cannabis] fits within what we are trying to do or whether it should be separate or whether the current landscape is such that we don't need to do anything further.""  The official position held by Colorado banks is that there needs to be a change to Federal law. Amanda Averch, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Bankers Association told CoinDesk:  “From day one, we have said the solution to the conflict of state and federal law regarding cannabis in this state is an act of Congress. I can’t really speak to blockchain and crypto which seem to be a whole set of different challenges.”  Wyoming's Long agreed that marijuana was probably a logical motivation for Colorado to proceed with an SPBI initiative, but added:  “I don't think the impetus for Colorado to try and copy Wyoming is marijuana. I think it's that many people in the industry know what's about to happen, which is about $20 billion of assets are about to come into Wyoming.”  *This article has been updated to show Colorado’s Office of Economic Development & International Trade (OEDIT) did not convene the group meetings as was originally stated.

The derivatives regulator announced Thursday during its annual Fintech Forward conference that LabCFTC would become its own independent office within the CFTC, reporting directly to the agency's chairman, Heath Tarbert. The group will continue its mission of acting as the agency's research wing into new financial technology, including blockchain and cryptocurrency tools.  LabCFTC has fallen under the CFTC Office of General Counsel's oversight since its formation in 2017, Tarbert said in prepared remarks shared with CoinDesk.  ""In its new capacity, LabCFTC will continue to be focused on both internal and external innovation,"" he said. This will include keeping the agency's employees up to date on new technology, adopting technological tools that the CFTC can use in its enforcement and anti-market manipulation missions, and continuing to gather input from industry participants.  The group was originally created ""to be a beachhead"" for blockchain and digital assets, as well as other financial technology developments, according to a press release. Since its creation the group has published an educational primer on smart contracts and a request for information on the ethereum cryptocurrency.  The group was headed up by Daniel Gorfine, who has since left the agency, and is now overseen by Melissa Netram, who was previously Intuit's director of global public policy and regulatory affairs.  LabCFTC will continue ""to play an even greater role"" as the regulator writes rules for these new products.  In his remarks, Tarbert said ""our agency’s vision is to be the global standard for sound derivatives regulation,"" adding:  ""I want the agency to be the resource for you to help identify ways those technologies could fit into the current regulatory structure. Now that LabCFTC’s success has been demonstrated, we want to solidify its position within the agency. Now it will take on an even bigger role here at the CFTC and be a critical link to innovators for years, and perhaps decades, to come.""  As part of its efforts, LabCFTC published a primer on artificial intelligence and its role in financial markets on Thursday, as part of an ongoing series of educational materials on new tools.  The primer defines artificial intelligence, outlines historical work in the field and notes how it might benefit the CFTC and its work overseeing commodity derivatives markets.  In a statement, Netram said ""progress depends on how well regulators respond to financial innovation.""  Her division is ""at the forefront"" of evaluating new tools, she said.

42403391,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfv86,1571904053,5 Takeaways on Ethereum 2.0 From Vitalik's 'Beast Mode' Blog Posts,"The Takeaway:  Moving ETH from the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain to the old ethereum blockchain may be possible in the early months (or years) after launch, new research suggests.  Due to changes in data storage structure, recalling data to applications will become more expensive on the new network.  Ethereum will soon lose the ability to execute transactions atomically. This could change the way developers and traders manage their dapps.  Ethereum 2.0 may possess only about half the transaction capacity as originally planned.      Things are moving fast for the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 project.  Aiming to get the broader public up to speed about changes being planned for 2.0, founder Vitalik Buterin wrote four blog posts about its launch during the platform's annual developer conference, Devcon.  Tentatively planned for launch sometime in the first quarter of 2020, 2.0 is expected to move the world’s second-largest blockchain platform away from a proof-of-work (PoW) system of transaction validation to proof-of-stake.  Proof-of-stake (PoS)  is widely expected to be more scalable and energy-efficient than PoW blockchains like bitcoin.  In preparation for the historic upgrade, Buterin is currently educating users and application developers about what’s in store come 2020 and beyond.  Coupled with one additional post written shortly before the Devcon conference, Buterin’s five blog posts addressing concerns and long-held unknowns about the Ethereum 2.0 network have become highly popular reads in the cryptocurrency community.  “This is incredible. When most of us are limping into the last day of the Devcon conference … Vitalik is cranking out analyses of some of the ecosystems [sic] largest obstacles. Forever impressed,” blockchain consultant Tyler Smith tweeted on Oct. 10. Others joked Buterin had entered “beast mode.”  https://twitter.com/R_Tyler_Smith/status/1182503135165550592?s=20  For those of us without time to dissect even one of Buterin's blog posts, let alone five of them, here’s the TL;DR in layman's terms.  1. Moving ETH from the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain to the old ethereum blockchain may once again be possible in the short term.  As the current Ethereum 2.0 design stands, it's likely to be years before the old ethereum PoW chain is fully merged into the new PoS network (see below).  Meanwhile, transfers of ETH between the two chains will be disabled.  This is because the added complexity of creating a two-way bridge, according to Ethereum 2.0 developer Preston Van Loon, presents “a security risk” to both chains.  “We could see a scenario where one blockchain gets messed up by another and we have to do a hard fork to recover funds or there’s a flaw where someone can print money,” said Van Loon, team lead at Prysmatic Labs.  Enabling transfers requires a secure method of ensuring ethereum’s PoW network is synced about the veracity of claims on the PoS network.  “The assumption is, in the first few months of the Ethereum 2.0 chain, it’s going to have a limited number of [transaction validators, also called ""stakers""] and potentially will have lower security than the current Ethereum 1.0 chain,” said Ben Edgington, blockchain protocol engineer at ethereum venture studio Consensys.  “That potentially provides an attack vector. If someone wants to generate free money on the Ethereum 1.0 chain, they could try to attack the ethereum 2.0 chain and then persuade the Ethereum 1.0 chain of their [fake] funds,"" said Edgington.  In a recent blog post  , Buterin suggests two possible ways to create a “bridge” between the two blockchains. He admits that “both of these proposals would require emergency remedial action on the Ethereum 1.0 side if the Ethereum 2.0 side breaks.”  To reduce such risks, Buterin suggests voting periods enabling “human intervention” to reverse transfers from the Ethereum 1.0 network.  These suggestions are presently just proposals. Other Ethereum 2.0 researchers like Danny Ryan have presented similar solutions to creating a secure bridge between the two networks.  For now, the group has not added a bridge to the roadmap design for Ethereum 2.0.  2. Ethereum 2.0 may function as its own separate blockchain from the original ethereum blockchain for years before the two are fully merged.  The beacon chain is the “heartbeat” of the new PoS network. This blockchain will act as a central command center to receive data about confirmed transactions from all other mini-blockchains (also called shards) in the Ethereum 2.0 network.  In Phase One, shards will be launched to link to the existing beacon chain. In Phase Two, developers will roll out execution environments for different types of decentralized applications (dapps) on each shard.  Thereafter, the full infrastructure of Ethereum 2.0 will be configured such that the present ethereum mainnet can safely and securely be merged into the new network fully.  Edgington suspects moving to phase two could take three to four years to complete.  “Ethereum 1.0 and Ethereum 2.0 can run alongside each other and continue in that configuration for as long as we like. … It’s not time-critical.”  What is critical is the security of assets on the current ethereum mainnet chain.  Blockchain researcher Mihailo Bjelic says a complex system such as Ethereum 2.0 should not replace the present ethereum mainnet until developers are sure of its reliability.  “It’s better never to launch Ethereum 2.0 if it’s not safe,” he said. “The responsible decision if you cannot ensure the security of the system is just to scrap it.”  In a second blog post, Buterin says he expects the transition, if and when it happens, to be smooth.  “If you are an application developer or a user ... the changes and disruptions that you experience will actually be quite limited. Existing applications will keep running with no change,” Buterin wrote.  3. Recalling data about the ethereum blockchain will become more expensive than before.  Dapp developers recalling and accessing data from the new ethereum network will face increased transaction costs. But Buterin offers advice about limiting the pain of these increases.  “If you are a developer, you can eliminate the largest part of disruption from gas cost changes by proactively making sure you don’t write apps with high witness sizes, ie. measure the total storage slots + contracts + contract code accessed in one transaction and make sure it’s not too high,” Buterin wrote.  The cost increases are due to changes in how the ethereum state – that is, the full account of transactions and accounts on the blockchain – is stored in a PoS network.  “The way that state is stored is completely changing in Ethereum 2.0. If I run a contract today [on ethereum], the state is on my hard disk or it’s on the hard disk of the node I’m talking to,” said Edgington, adding:  “In Ethereum 2.0, everything is stateless. … I can store the bits of state I’m interested in locally or there will be providers like Infura who specialize in providing state. The idea is that a marketplace will spring up whereby people store the data on behalf of others.""  4. Ethereum will lose the ability to execute transactions atomically.  Perhaps most importantly for dapp developers: the next major iteration of the network will break the ability for transactions on ethereum to occur atomically, meaning all at once.  Developers will no longer be able to execute transactions between different applications such that, if one transaction fails, the entire series of transactions can be recovered immediately. This is only possible on ethereum today because all dapps live on a single, shared blockchain network.  Ethereum 2.0 will break up the transaction load into different shards. Theoretically, dapps creating new ethereum transactions will similarly be dispersed and hosted on differing shard networks. This introduces a new dynamic for transaction execution on the ethereum blockchain such that one shard network cannot know the full state of a different shard network instantly.  “If I execute a transaction on Shard One and then I want to transact with something on Shard Two, it takes a whole block before Shard Two knows what happened on Shard One,” said Edgington.  According to Edgington, this introduces “a layer of complexity” to dapp programming that is not entirely unfamiliar in the traditional computer science world.  “Databases do this all the time. There are locking mechanisms so that I can temporarily lock the resources I am interested in and a release it later when I’m confident that everything has happened,” said Edgington.  Mihailo Bjelic said this “asynchronous communication” is the industry standard in computer systems and networks in general.  “It’s easier to reason about and envision any possible attack vectors or flaws in the code,” said Bjelic. But dapp developers will need time to adapt:  “Every time you introduce a new developer paradigm you have this thing called a learning curve and developers don’t like it.""  Indeed, some in the ethereum community are concerned about the negative impact this change will pose to dapp composability, or as Buterin describes in his post, “the ability of different applications to easily talk to each other.”  “[Losing] atomicity will discourage a lot of these activities, and make it harder to attract [cryptocurrency] traders,"" Loi Luu, the CEO of ethereum-based token exchange platform Kyber Network, wrote in response to Buterin’s blog post.  Large-scale dapps requiring the capacity of multiple shards will become harder to manage, said Dieter Shirley, CTO of blockchain gaming startup (and CryptoKitties creator) Dapper Labs.  “Moving tokens between shards is no problem. … But when we’re looking at something like CryptoKitties, it is much more than just some tokens,” he said.  “Sharding doesn’t make anything impossible. It just makes it hard enough that certain things won’t get done.""  5. Ethereum 2.0 will only possess about half the transaction capacity as was originally planned for launch.  Buterin's fifth post about Ethereum 2.0 suggests a stark reduction in the total number of shards at launch.  The new network was originally envisaged as having an estimated 1,024 shards, but Buterin recently proposed a mere 64. The main benefit, he said, will be faster and simpler communication between shards in Ethereum 2.0.  “This provides enough functionality to … allow users to hold coins on shards, use those coins to send transaction fees, and move those coins between shards as easily as they move them within a shard,” Buterin wrote.  This would reduce the burden of cross-shard communication for dapp developers, according to Edgington.  “In the previous Ethereum 2.0 design, if Shard One wanted to know the status of Shard Two, it had to wait like 64 slots, which is roughly six and a half minutes. Under this new design, shards can become aware of the other state of a shard within one slot, so around six seconds,” Edgington said.  It will also reduce the number of complexities in the overall Ethereum 2.0 network, according to Bjelic.  “You’re taking such an operational risk [launching 1,024 shards] which have not yet been battle-tested,” Bjelic said. “It’s easier intuitively [with 64] because there are less cross-shard messages to transfer across the network.”  But the overall capacity of the Ethereum 2.0 network at its outset will be sizably reduced.  “We’re targeting about half the transaction throughput of the former design,” said Edgington.  Van Loon says that the benefit of increased cross-shard communication speeds is entirely worth it, though:  “We don’t need 1,024 times the capacity of Ethereum right now. 64 times would be a huge increase and, if we could do faster cross-linking between shards, I think the tradeoff is really worth it. ... We can grow this number later as time goes on.”  Ethereum 2.0 is a work-in-progress  All said, Ethereum 2.0 is still a work-in-progress and Buterin’s word is not law.  “Just because Vitalik posts something doesn’t mean it’s set in stone. The whole reason this is put out there is to encourage discussion with the community,” said Zak Cole, founder and CEO of blockchain startup Whiteblock. His company is assisting in ethereum 2.0 protocol development. “It helps get everyone informed and understand[ing] exactly what is happening.”  Cole has reservations about the proposals recently put out by Buterin, including the idea of creating an intermediary two-way bridge between the Ethereum PoW and PoS chains.  “It seems pretty risky to me,” Cole said. “It’s going to require additional changes to the ETH 1.0 chain. … I don’t think we should mess with the ETH 1.0 chain.”  Disagreements between researchers and constant changes in direction don't worry Bjelic. The eternal state of any complex software is eternal evolution.  “There is no final version of any software. You will always to keep improving,” he said.  Still, Cole said having a rough understanding of “what the future is going to look like” is important.  “You don’t start building a skyscraper without a blueprint. You don’t start building the first floor until you’re sure what the top floor is going to look like,” he said.  Van Loon said successful public blockchain development requires good communication between researchers and dapp developers.  “Uncertainty breeds fear,” he said, adding:  “Something Vitalik learned at Devcon is that we need to start putting these ideas out in writing more frequently and more consistently.”  Vitalik Buterin image by Leigh Cuen for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | KNC | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/24/5-takeaways-on-ethereum-20-from-vitaliks-beast-mode-blog-posts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aae535136884275442a338a0c64035ff03e60fee-1093x604.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blockchain Ventures said on Tuesday that the investment makes it the first equity investor in the gaming tech firm, which enables tokenized in-game items to be ported across ethereum-based titles built using its platform.  Blockchain Ventures didn't disclose the amount of the investment.  Singapore-based Enjin has built a number of apps to support its ecosystem, including a blockchain wallet, a marketplace for collectibles and a game-development platform allowing third-party devs to include blockchain in their projects.

According to an Oct. 22 announcement, SoftBank said it will be working with IBM as well as blockchain startup TBCASoft that develops cross-carrier blockchain networks in order to carry out applications under the Carrier Blockchain Study Group Consortium.  TBCASoft was founded in 2016 and has received funding from SoftBank. In 2017, together with SoftBank, Sprint and Taiwan's FarEasTone, it formed the Carrier Blockchain Study Group (CBSG), now an 18-member consortium working toward the development of blockchain solutions for phone companies.  SoftBank added that the first project being undertaken by the CBSG is the Cross-Carrier Payment Systemhttps://www.tbcasoft.com/solutions (CCPS), which is aimed to allow mobile-phone customers to pay locally using their devices when traveling outside their home countries.Other members of the consortiumhttps://www.tbcasoft.com/blockchain-consortium include Korea's LG U+ and KT, Malaysia's Axiata, Telekomunikasi Indonesia International, Turkey's Turkcell and PLDT of the Philippines.  The Oct. 22 announcement did not provide much detail about the terms of the agreement between the three companies, though it noted that TBCASoft will be using the IBM Blockchain Platform, IBM's Hyperledger-powered enterprise blockchain solution.  ""This is a business relationship,"" an IBM spokesperson clarified by email. ""IBM is not joining the consortium.""  TBCASoft technology helps ""optimize"" clearing between different carriers and transaction records, according to the announcement, and allows for the interoperability of mobile networks and the bolting on of networks of merchants to enable payments.  The announcement also noted that SoftBank plans to have a payments system in operation in Tokyo in 2020, when the Olympics will be held in the city.  Last year, SoftBank completed a blockchain proof-of-concept in partnership with TBCASoft that would allow peer-to-peer mobile payments across different carriers.

42413922,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAnSS8,1571889640,Ontario Regulator Lets Security Token Startup Test Secondary Trading,"The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) is allowing a tokenization startup to facilitate secondary-market trading of its tokens by giving the firm regulatory relief for a short time.  TokenGX, an affiliate of TokenFunder, has been given the green light to pilot the project to gather data on secondary-market trading, according to an OSC filing. The trading would help TokenFunder, a startup that helps other firms raise funds through token sales, provide liquidity for investors, the regulator said.  Both TokenGX and TokenFunder run on the public ethereum blockchain, so initial token offerings, as well as secondary market trading transactions, are visible to anyone.  TokenGX is the first company approved by the OSC for such testing, the company said.  This isn’t the first time that the regulator has given TokenFunder relief for token-related projects. In October 2017, the OSC gave the startup relief from a dealer registration requirement and approved TokenFunder’s initial token offering, which cleared the way for the offering of its FNDR tokens.  In April of this year, TokenGX became an exempt market dealer in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Québec so it could operate its primary distribution platform, which distributes the tokens. TokenGX is working to seek approval in other jurisdictions to run the secondary market, according to the filing.  The secondary trading will take place on a platform developed by TokenGX called FreedomX and will be limited to sellers and purchasers who are residents of Ontario and have been whitelisted as investors who have gone through TokenGX’s know-your-customer processes.  Any participant on the platform can create new orders and trading is executed by smart contracts after traders make the trade through an order book interface. The platform is open to accredited as well as retail investors, but trades for retail investors cannot exceed $2,500.  Investors pay for trades with ""settlement balance tokens"" rather than fiat currency. Token GX will buy and sell these tokens at a fixed price of one Canadian dollar. The balance tokens can be acquired by transferring funds to the user’s trust account held by a Canadian custodian that the regulator’s filing did not name, and these tokens can’t be shared with wallets outside of TokenGX’s system.  FNDR tokens can be traded on the secondary platform, as can tokens issued by no more than ten Ontario-based issuers that have already issued tokens with TokenGX. These issuers' financial records have to be regularly reviewed by TokenGX as part of the pilot.  Token Funder is participating in Creative Destruction Lab’s (CDL's) 10-month blockchain accelerator program, the filing noted. The fact that TokenFunder is based in Ontario and owned by a corporation in the Canadian province was also a plus for the commission.

42403406,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfvJu,1571882482,"Tencent Says Libra Would Pose Serious Threat to Alipay, WeChat Pay","Tencent, the Chinese internet giant and parent of messaging app WeChat, said the proposed launch of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency would pose serious risks to existing digital payment systems.  In a blockchain whitepaper published in Chinese this week, Tencent said Facebook’s Libra initiative seems “bold and radical” but is actually a “prudent and rational” move for the Silicon Valley giant.  The Libra coin could quickly win market share in countries that do not have a credible local currency of their own, or in places where people do not have access to basic financial infrastructure, it continued. But that would be direct competition the Chinese companies could not replicate.  “Any internet company that has a relatively mature digital payment system, such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, would be threatened by the stablecoin if it is ever launched,"" the whitepaper reads.  China's central bank has been working on its own national digital currency for the past few years, while banning any fiat-to-crypto trading activities in the country since 2017. Neither Tencent nor Alibaba, which operates WeChat Pay's competitor Alipay, is involved in any known cryptocurrency or trading projects.  With more than 1 billion active daily users on Tencent’s social media WeChat, its digital payment spinoff WeChat Pay is one of the two leading companies in the industry, along with Alipay, the mobile payment affiliate of Alibaba Group.  Both WeChat and Alipay have insisted on a firm stance against crypto exchanges using their payment services as a gateway for Chinese customers' fiat on-ramp in a peer-to-peer fashion through over-the-counter trading.  “WeChat Pay does not support crypto trading, and the platform has never been open to any crypto category,” the company's official account said in a post on Weibo.  “We welcome users to report on any crypto trading on our platform and proactively collaborate with authorities to crack down on such activities,” WeChat added in the post.  Alipay also reiterated its ban on crypto trading in a recently tweet directed at Binance when the exchange enabled over-the-counter trading that would allow Chinese users to exchange crypto assets with a counter-party and settle payments via peer-to-peer transactions on Alipay.  Alipay said in the tweet:  “If any transactions are identified as being related to bitcoin or other virtual currencies, Alipay immediately stops the relevant payment services.”  And yet while both Chinese companies share the official stance on crypto assets, they are heavily investing in blockchain and cloud computing technologies.  WeChat parent Tencent has been building a suite of blockchain services since they released their first white paper in 2017.  The company’s new TrustSQL platform is designed as a three-part system with the core chain layer, a product and service layer, and an application layer to provide digital asset management and authentication.  Tencent led a $20 million Series A round in blockchain provenance startup Everledger, also participated in by asset manager Fidelity Investments, in September.  The company also partnered with Intel to develop a blockchain for internet of things applications, while starting to test blockchain financial applications with the Bank of China in 2017.  In 2018, Alipay’s parent Alibaba Group actually topped the list with a total of 90 patent applications focused on blockchain-related technologies, even more than other multinational companies including IBM, Mastercard and the Bank of America.  “The launch of Libra would significantly affect the course of global expansion for digital payment companies, especially for those who are not in the Libra consortium,” Tencent's whitepaper said.  Tencent, with a market cap of nearly $400 billion, has been a communications and internet leader in China since the very beginning. Founded in 1998, the company's name echos the prior decade's favorite technology, the belt clip beeper, or pager. Known across China as ""cent,"" that suffix was added to the last character ""teng"" of the founder's name, Huateng Ma, according to Shenzhen tech lore.
