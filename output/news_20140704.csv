42397751,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3ME,1404509424,"All Things Alt: McShibe Burgers, E-Sports Currencies and a Game of Coins","There have been some exciting (and kind of bizzare) developments in the past week and a half in the alternative digital currency world. Unfortunately, in an ecosystem of hundreds of coins, one can only hope to get a taste of what’s happening amid all the activity.  With July underway and the summer of 2014 shaping up to be a big one for digital currencies of all kinds, let’s take a look at a couple of the recent happenings in alt that could have long-term effects on the altcoin movement.  McShibe burger creator pitches design to McDonald’s  In May, the dogecoin community entered a series of digital currency-themed burger designs into a contest held by McDonald’s UK. At the time, the most popular entry – the McDogecoin – was removed by administrators, resulting in the production of additional burger designs by the community. One of these was the 'McShibe', which was ultimately selected for the contest’s final round by the fast food giant.  Earlier this week, the creator of the McShibe traveled to McDonald’s UK corporate offices to prepare the McShibe for presentation and tasting. He detailed the visit on the dogecoin subreddit, describing the process and sharing the McDonald’s UK team’s enthusiasm for both the community and digital currency as a whole.  Speaking with CoinDesk, he said that several of the participants from McDonald’s had many questions about dogecoin. As well, he said that the McDonald’s UK burger testers enjoyed the taste of the McShibe, and that he felt confident the burger would be selected by McDonald’s for a week-long trial period at select restaurants.  He said:  “I rate my chances high, as the judges liked the burgers' taste and the whole community aspect behind the burger. They seemed quite impressed with the power of Internet and I had some of them ask tons of questions about dogecoin, how it works, etc.”  Now, McDonald's UK will deliberate on the final entries. CoinDesk will provide an update on this story as it develops.  Vertcoin releases stealth address update  In a recent edition of All Things Alt, we discussed vertcoin’s move to incorporate stealth addresses. This development strategy was aimed, in part, at creating a solution for users who want privacy that sidesteps some of the problems associated with integrating transaction anonymity technology.  Earlier this week, the vertcoin development team announced the release of stealth addresses in the vertcoin mainnet after testing on the alt’s merged-mined coin Monocle.  The team noted on the Bitcoin Talk forum that the stealth deployment is a good compromise between demand for transaction concealment from users who prioritise privacy and concerns from more mainstream users and investors, who feel a focus on anonymity is unnecessary and potentially harmful.  The team said:  “Business users may have worried anonymous payments would prove too litigious to be practical; personal users may have worried about the integrity of payments with full anonymity. Now both can rest assured because the privacy vertcoin's stealth addresses provide are right in line with what we would all expect from a world-class coin.”  The team cautioned that, as more nodes are being added, there could be delays for large-scale vertcoin transactions that take place via the stealth option. However, SX functionality, as it is called, is said to be working at normal speeds for smaller VTC amounts.  Minerals, leaguecoin stake claim to e-sports betting  There’s little doubt that e-sports, also known as competitive gaming, has been catching on worldwide for years. In the past two years, e-sports viewership has increased dramatically. According to a report by digital gaming market research firm Super Data Research, as many as 71 million people around the globe watch e-sports events, as of 2013.  Games like StarCraft II, League of Legends and Dota II attract huge audiences, and proportionally significant cash prizes for those who excel at the games. Players can make hundreds of thousands of dollars per year based on their gaming skill, whereas the gambling market on these events is estimated to be in the millions of dollars annually.  Demand for e-sports betting has led to the creation of at least two altcoins that will focus primarily on facilitating bets using digital currencies. Leaguecoin and minerals, both of which are proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrids, each present different approaches to how betting on popular games can lead to broader alt adoption.  Minerals launched the public beta of a new wallet-based betting feature on 3rd July, enabling users to place bets on StarCraft II matches. While the development team cautioned that there could be bugs and suggested that participants only bet small amounts, early reports indicate that the functionality worked as planned.  Leaguecoin focuses specifically on League of Legends and the development team is expected to launch an e-betting site next week. In addition to the site, the alt will feature two bot layers – a tip bot and a betting bot – to enable faster bets and provide more connectivity with the central betting platform.  It remains to be seen if one coin or the other takes a prominent role in digital currency e-sports betting. Upcoming e-sports tournaments – and the potential for both coins to launch features or events that generate enthusiasm – could play a role in how either alt develops in the weeks ahead.  Strange alt of the week  Coins that celebrate a certain public figure or character aren’t exactly new in the alternative digital currency world. For example, coin developers have created alts based on everyone from Internet celebrities to noted politicians.  We can now add fictional characters from books and TV shows with aryacoin, an alt branded after Arya Stark from 'A Song of Ice and Fire' by fantasy author George R. R. Martin. The character has become famous in recent years on the popular HBO show 'Game of Thrones', where the character is played by Maisie Williams.  The aryacoin project calls for integration with the broader proprietary property, based on the books and TV show as a vehicle for broader usage. For this, aryacoin has won this week’s Strange Alt of the Week award.  Notably, the developer stated on Bitcoin Talk that key project goals include being used as a currency for buying official merchandise, and as in-game currency for any Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire-themed video games.  The coin itself is a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid based on the X11 mining algorithm, with a maximum supply of 5 million coins and an annual interest rate of 20%.  Unfortunately, it appears that the aryacoin project may not be launched, owing to a lack of investors during an initial public-offering phase. According to the developer, aryacoin could be launched later if interest grows.  Images via Bitcoin Talk, reddit    Have a tip about a notable happening in the altcoin world?

42397738,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3AQ,1404505520,"Bitfin Day Two: We Need More Global, Organised Bitcoin Education","Greg Brockman, CTO of internet payments company Stripe, opened day two of the Bitfin conference in Dublin with his views on what bitcoin needs to become more appealing to a mainstream audience.  The Harvard and MIT graduate said the main reason people are reluctant to start using bitcoin is the lack of trust and protection that comes with traditional finance.  He believes centralised consumer trust providers will emerge, providing a stamp of approval to sites and merchants that are to known to be trusted in the bitcoin space.  These providers will be responsible for mediating chargebacks and will have to create and enforce a set of rules to make sure its approved merchants remain reliable.  Brockman went on to explain that Stripe is currently testing bitcoin payments and is pleased with how this is developing.  ""It's a very exciting time and we're still figuring things out as we go along,"" he said.    Stripe CTO @thegdb kicks off day two at #BitFin Dublin with keynote speech 'Bitcoin for the Mainstream' pic.twitter.com/ROjnUCxAuZ      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) July 4, 2014    In a panel discussion titled Next Generation Payments, Steve Beauregard of digital currency payments processor GoCoin encouraged merchants to take steps to encourage their customers to pay in bitcoin. He suggested the use of special offers or discounts for customers who pay in digital currency. ""Merchants need to be strategic right now and work to make this their main payment method,"" he said, adding:    “[Bitcoin] is the biggest no-brainer in the history of e-commerce.""          Education  The topic of raising awareness of bitcoin on a global scale came up in a later panel discussion featuring Blockchain’s Nic Carey, BTC China’s Bobby Lee, Ocean Bank’s Oleg Pokrovsky, BitPesa’s Amy Ludlum and Bitonic’s Pieterjan Goppel.  Cary  said he'd like to see universities add cryptocurrencies to their curriculums to increase awareness of the topic and also widen the talent pool available to digital currency companies. He said it's also important for existing resources, which are largely in English, to be translated into other languages and distributed widely across the world.  Ludlum, whose company BitPesa is bringing digital currency awareness to Africa by converting bitcoin to the Kenyan shilling, said the problem her company faces is that it can't rely on digital marketing campaigns to spread the word about bitcoin. She explained:    ""It's all in-person education, which hasn’t proved impossible, it just requires more time and effort.""          Localisation was also top of the agenda at the ‘Exchanges and Onramps’ panel session moderated by BTC China CEO Bobby Lee.  “You can’t just roll out a platform globally and expect everyone to jump on board,” said Bit4Coin co-founder Dolf Diederichsen, citing the need for solutions tailored to different markets, languages and legal systems.  The panel also featured a lively debate about the usability of current fiat and bitcoin exchanges. CurrencyFair CEO Brett Myers argued that his “typically non-sophisticated” customer base had no issue using an order book format when exchanging funds, with 25-33% opting in for the mechanism. However, fellow panelists Brandon Goldman and Amy Ludlum argued that Coinbase and BitPesa’s fixed-price model was preferable for new users.  Banking innovation  Members of the 'Bitcoin Adoption by Banks' panel discussed today's announcement from the ECB, which advised EU banks to steer clear of bitcoin until some clear-cut rules are put in place by regulators.  Lee Penrose, of Cayman National Bank and Trust Company, which is based on the Isle of Man, said many European banks that were previously showing some interest in bitcoin now shy away from digital currency until advised to do otherwise.  Ferdinando Ametrano, of Banca IMI, believes we could now see banks begin to innovate in the area of digital currencies. They are aware of the technology and what it is capable of, so they may try to implement some of its benefits within their existing systems. Diacle's Adam Vaziri disagreed. He doesn't see innovation coming from within banks any time soon, he said:    ""Innovation within financial services requires innovators, and those won't necessarily be found in banking.""          However, he conceded that the innovators wont succeed if they try and go it alone. Vaziri said innovators want to disrupt the industry, but they need the help of the banks in order for change to happen.  Key challenges  Michael Terpin, co-founder of BitAngels, moderated the final panel of the conference, which featured The Kaiser Report host Max Keiser, taxi-calling app Hailo's Jay Bregman, Stripe's Greg Brockman, BitPesa's Elizabeth Rossiello and Rainey Reitman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Keiser emphasised the revolutionary nature of bitcoin, stating that he sees the ability of a population to control or create its own money supply as extremely important. He went on to say the inadequacies of the current banking system are facilitating the growth of digital currency:    “The success of bitcoin will be driven by the repeated failures of the banks and traditional financial system [...] The banks are shooting themselves in the head, they're so tied to this business model of fraud. There is no room for legal behaviour in banking.”          Rossiello shared her equally scathing view of the banks, stating that people can easily go on to survive without a central financial system and labelling bankers untrustworthy and criminals. Reitman turned the discussion to developers, claiming that it’s not just regulators and the banks that can impact the progression and freedom of bitcoin, but those developing the core protocol.    ""Regarding what is and isn’t possible, core devs have more of an impact [than regulators] on end-user freedom."" - @RaineyReitman #BitFin — CoinDesk (@coindesk) July 4, 2014            Bregman rounded off the panel, and the conference, by answering an audience-posed question about his company’s plans in relation to bitcoin integration.  “From a personal perspective, I’d love to do it. From a corporate perspective I can’t say at this point. If we could pay our drivers in bitcoin, and they could remit to their families, that would be a great financial benefit,” he said.  The main takeaway from Bregman’s comments is that, for Hailo, accepting bitcoin is a question of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’.

The Wall Street Journal confirmed that several individuals on the list received phishing emails from the same source. However, not all the individuals on the leaked email recipients list were targeted.  The unfortunate victim of the attack was Sam Lee of bitcoin arbitrage fund Bitcoins Reserve, which lost 100 BTC as a result.  The funds were sent by the firm's chief technology officer, Jim Chen, after he received what seemed like an email request to do so from Lee. In fact, the funds ended up being sent outside the company to the attacker's wallet. The transaction can be seen here, according to Lee.  Operational oversight  Lee said that the funds he had been scammed out of were owned by Bitcoins Reserve and that he used personal funds to replace them. He informed Bitcoins Reserve investors about the situation in an email, saying:  ""As this attack vector was only successful due to an oversight in operations, the founders of Bitcoins Reserve will compensate the company by injecting an additional 100 Bitcoins to ensure we're still effectively performing arbitrage for our investors.""  How they did it  The complete procedure for the scam was complicated and extremely sophisticated, but the basic process was as follows.  Lee received an email on 21st June from a certain 'Linda Jackson' claiming to represent BitFilm Production, a genuine company based in Germany. Jackson falsely claimed that the firm was assembling a series of interviews about the impending auction for a client.  Jackson then sent Lee a second email containing a link that directed to a file containing the questions for the interviews. This appeared to be a Google Drive document, but was actually a website controlled by the attacker.  The faked page then requested Lee's email password to gain access to the document, and consequently, when the password was entered, the attacker gained access to Lee's email accounts.  The scammers finally sent an email, purporting to be from Lee, to various employees requesting funds be sent to an external bitcoin wallet address, and the CTO unsuspectingly complied.  Facts agree  Lee's version of the story, and the emails from the attacker corroborating it (which CoinDesk has been given access to), mirror the phishing method described in the WSJ article.  The Journal also reported that while BitFilm Production is a real company, it had never attempted to contact the individuals on the leaked email.  The US Marshals Service has since issued a statement, saying that individuals affected by phishing scams should contact the appropriate law enforcement authorities, noting that the FBI dealt with phishing scams in the United States.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/07/04/phishing-scam-targets-us-marshals-service-bitcoin-auction-list,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e48f512f36bc83b9c022f3b4a57af5bcd03e868b-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397752,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3LF,1404486125,Bitcoin: A Means for Global Independence,"With some research and a little technical aptitude, distributed forms of money such as bitcoin can be used as the digital equivalent of cash, offering the potential for anyone to theoretically bank themselves without relying on traditional financial institutions.  Additionally, innovative wallet technologies mean anyone can store vast amounts of value without the need to trust governments or banks. From brain wallets to paper wallets, multisig to BIP32 hierarchical deterministic technologies, the ability to store cryptocurrency value independent of a third party is becoming more sophisticated by the month.  This all adds up to a revolution in personal finance that can be attributed to smart and enterprising developers who see digital currencies as a means for independence that has never before been possible.  Independence and banking  The 4th July holiday is known for being a mid-summer soiree of fireworks, sun and socialising, but many forget that, 238 years ago, on 4th July 1776, the founders of America signed a document proclaiming independence, sovereignty over its land.  At that time, the founders faced the threat of war from a king very far away and it took over eight years in the Revolutionary War – a war against ‘rebels’ as the British called Americans during that time – before complete independence from Britain was secured.  The Americans who fought in the Revolutionary War believed that they could create a new country with equality and liberty as its keystone.  Now, another revolution is underway, with similar ideals. Distributed currency makes possible the independent safekeeping of monetary value previously strained by physical limitations. When fiat currency first became prevalent, banks were tasked with the security and accountancy of money.  Today, now that most value is relegated to the role of a database store, cryptocurrency can free those who distrust the motives of third parties, namely government and the banking industry it controls.  This is the mantra of so-called crypto-anarchists and many libertarians. But political aspects aside, at the very least, bitcoin and its variants bring a new concept to the mind of the traditional banker: competition in the form of a totally new type of money.  The Federal Reserve, with its ability to control monetary policy with the pulling of a few levers, believes it can compete as a capable adversary. It will be interesting to watch how this saga unfolds.  A new revolution  A startup environment is quickly evolving around bitcoin, for the most part, but other cryptocurrencies too. These small companies are embracing the upsides of decentralized technology and are starting to change the way people think about financial businesses.  The proof of a revolution can be found in the resistance, and that exists in the current financial situation, with many bitcoin companies still struggling to get bank accounts.  Very few US-based bitcoin enterprises, for example, are able to easily convert cash from a customer’s bank account into bitcoin, like Coinbase does.  The problems of failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox are likely to have exacerbated this issue in 2014. Many nascent companies wishing to start bitcoin-related enterprises even have problems getting bank accounts just for payroll purposes because their website contains the word 'bitcoin'.  Incumbent financial institutions are afraid, with big concerns about what bitcoin and its alternative counterparts might mean for their business prospects.  They are at the behest of regulators, and because there still is not clear regulation – despite some states like California making bold moves on the cryptocurrency front – there is caution towards decentralized systems that are so innovative that the old ways of doing things could disappear, if they don't adapt, at least.  A more distributed world  The United States, from its founding to the end of World War II, established itself as a global power. But the country's ability to wield financial and traditional wars appears to be waning. New, distributed disruptors have wreaked havoc on America’s traditional way of combatting enemies.  Many divisive issues such as same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization have been meted out to be contested at the state level. And the issue of terrorism is being fought with a deployment of not people, but swarms of disparate drones that can incisively target and take out nefarious and often singular actors.  The world that exists today rewards systems of distribution. Power is being held more by individuals than, perhaps, most realize.  In places where corruption is rife, uprisings such as the Arab Spring have shown that people with technology in the palm of their hands can start a revolution against government suffrage.  If George Washington had had that sort of technology in the Revolutionary War, perhaps the insurgent battles with a far-away foreign power would have been decidedly more favourable in terms of less lives lost.  The block chain is still a very new example of this idea of complete, yet public, distribution. Its technology has been in use for years now, but it has taken that long for many to fully grasp its true power.  From certification of public proof to tracking down hackers to stymieing corruption, the block chain, separate from monetary value, may have more value to change balances of power than anything before it.  Independence can bank everyone  The 4th July is a time to celebrate and ponder American independence. It is a time for reflection on how systems that don’t require third-party trust can foster a healthy dose of individual autonomy.  Reliance on technology is something that humankind deals with on a persistent and prevalent basis. It's important to remember, however, that leveraging new technology such as an imperturbable block chain can help everyone achieve a higher level of financial independence than ever before.  Consider poorer neighbourhoods all over the world that suffer from being underbanked. Or the vast majority of people in developing economies that are completely unbanked.  There’s no reason why cryptocurrency can't give everyone the ability to better control their own money – improved financial independence – without the complete reliance on a government or financial system that has sometimes clearly been a complete failure.  The unfortunate juxtaposition to bitcoin innovation is that it is happening mostly in developed countries. This is for a variety of reasons, but largely because that is where the expertise is, and investment in good ideas is common practice.  However, there is no doubt that the risk-taking and innovative ideas of digital currencies will spread money-based sovereignty to every corner of the globe.  That’s one good reason for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to think about independence on 4th July as a global prospect for financial access for everyone – something that should be a right for all individuals, no matter where they live.

42397748,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3JH,1404477017,Mycelium Announces 'Entropy' Offline USB Paper Wallet Creator,"Android wallet provider Mycelium has made announcements on a number of projects this week, including a USB device that offers a unique and more secure way of generating paper wallets for storing bitcoin.  Called Entropy, the USB dongle device allows users to create their paper wallet without an Internet connection being involved at any point of the process.  Look, no web  The small USB device is simply plugged into a compatible printer’s USB port, where it generates a random number with 256-bits of entropy, which is then used to generate a paper wallet with private and public keys.  This wallet is then fed to the printer as a jpeg image file, which is destroyed when the process is complete.  This is what the end result looks like:  The most obvious advantage of this approach is that the paper wallet does not end up on a computer or any device that could be hacked, greatly reducing the chance of having your bitcoin stolen.  Mycelium  adds that Entropy has additional security features:  “This is currently the most secure way to create paper wallets, since the keys are never exposed to the web, use true high level entropy, and only exist on paper. For extra security, Mycelium Entropy can also create M-of-N split keys, where the private key is split up in such a way that you need two out of three parts to spend from an address. In this way, if one of your paper backups is lost or stolen, the thief still can't steal your coins, and you can still access them using the remaining 2 paper backups.”  The company's video explains the basic concept well:  According to Mycelium, the Entropy devices are already fully functional, but need a few software fixes before release.  Furthermore, the company is raising money via an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign to allow a bigger production run (to bring down the cost of the devices), and because it needs about $1,500 for testing and compliance. About 30% of the necessary funds have been raised so far.  Project updates  In addition to Entropy, Mycelium also provided information on several other projects when it rolled out its new website earlier this week.  Bitcoincard  – a combination of wallet and payment device – is in the “final stages of development”, the company says, and is nearing completion. The card has been in development for some time and some features eventually had to be scaled down. However, the company indicates it should sell for less than competing hardware wallets.  The Mycelium Payment System is a new and ambitious scheme that allows offline merchants to accept bitcoin with relative ease. The company describes it as a ""revolutionary payment system"" with no commissions. More details are to be announced soon.  Also new, the Gateway bitcoin ATMis a two-way machine that acts as a gateway that can be used to sync the company's Bitcoincards with the bitcoin network.

42397734,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE37T,1404471141,"EBA: Financial Institutions Should Avoid Bitcoin, Await Regulation","UPDATE (4th July 21:25 BST): This article has been updated to include responses to the EBA by the Bitcoin Foundation and the UK Digital Currency Association.      The European Banking Authority (EBA) has published an 'opinion' warning financial institutions to stay away from digital currencies until the industry is regulated.  In the document, which was addressed to the EU council, European Commission and European Parliament, the EBA set out new requirements for the regulation of digital currencies and also instructed financial institutions not to buy, hold or sell digital currencies until new rules are in place.  The EU banking watchdog further called for a “thorough assessment” of digital currencies carried out jointly with other European authorities, including the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).  Earlier this year, the ECB said bitcoin should not be ignored or dismissed, but it also pointed out that it poses substantial risks.  Associated risks  The EBA notes that there are some potential benefits from digital currencies, including faster, cheaper transactions and more financial inclusion. However, the EBA believes the risks outweigh the benefits, which are “less pronounced” in the EU.  The EBA identified more than 70 risks across several categories: from risks for users, to those that could affect existing payments in conventional currencies and financial integrity.  The principle risk outlined by the EBA is the fact that digital currencies remain decentralised and they can be created and changed by anyone with enough computational power, anonymously. The EBA singled out miners as a threat, since they can remain anonymous and IT security cannot be guaranteed.  As a result, the EBA believes a “substantial body of regulation” is necessary to address these risks, saying:  “Based on this assessment, the EBA is of the view that a regulatory approach to address these risks would require a substantial body of regulation, some components of which would need to be developed in more detail. In particular, a regulatory approach would need to cover governance requirements for several market participants, the segregation of client accounts, capital requirements and, most importantly, the creation of ‘scheme governing authorities' accountable for the integrity of a particular virtual currency scheme and its key components, including its protocol and transaction ledger.”  EBA's immediate response  Aware that the regulatory framework cannot be changed on short notice, the EBA says it is issuing an “immediate response” to address the issue.  It is advising national supervisory authorities to “discourage credit institutions, payment institutions and e-money institutions from buying, holding, or selling virtual currencies” until the new regime is in place.  “While this response will mitigate risks arising from the interaction between virtual currency schemes and regulated financial services, it will not address risks arising within, or between, virtual currencies schemes themselves,” the EBA points out.  It continues: “This two-pronged approach will allow virtual currencies schemes to develop outside the financial services sector and will also allow financial institutions to maintain a current account relationship with businesses active in the field of virtual currencies.”  The recommendations are more or less in line with previous announcements and warnings from EU and national regulators, and also echo the EBA’s previous digital currency warning, issued last December. This time though, the EBA is calling for a comprehensive regulatory approach to digital currencies.  Bitcoin groups' response  The Bitcoin Foundation rejected the EBA report's recommendation that various financial institutions stop holding or trading in digital currencies in a statementhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/07/04/will-europe-listen-to-europe/ issued today. The Foundation said doing so would come at ""significant cost"" to Europeans.  The Foundation also criticised the EBA report's risk assessment methodology, saying that the ""blunt"" risk ranking used in the report created the impression that an overwhelming amount of risk is associated with digital currencies. A statement from Jim Harper, the foundation's Global Policy Counsel, read:  ""Europe's states and people are figuring out for themselves how to get the benefits of Bitcoin while controlling the costs. They may not listen to the European Banking Authority.""  The UK Digital Currency Association also responded to the EBA today, saying that it is ""unsurprised"" by the banking association's proposal as it is not aware of any UK banks currently offering banking facilities to digital currency businesses. It urged engagement from the EBA to create a framework that mitigates risk for all participants in a digital currency economy, and warned that ""stifling"" the development of digital currencies would be ""detrimental to the greater public good"".

42397732,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE36U,1404460254,"CoinSummit London Announces New Speakers, Startup Winners","CoinSummit London, the upcoming, two-day digital currency conference scheduled to run from 10th-11th July, has added new speakers to its already exciting lineup and announced the winning companies in its 'startup showcase' feature.  Organised by husband-and-wife team Pamir Gelenbe and Gulnar Hasnain, CoinSummit London will take place at the East Wintergarden venue in central London, aiming to connect entrepreneurs, investors, hedge fund professionals and others with an interest in the growing digital currency ecosystem.  ""The bitcoin space has changed tremendously since our first conference last year. We went from a somewhat fringe libertarian movement to venture capitalists investing $200m in bitcoin companies in the last 12 months and the US government auctioning bitcoins,"" Gelenbe told CoinDesk, adding:  ""There is a long and challenging road ahead, but it's heartening to see so many smart entrepreneurs joining the adventure.""  Lineup additions  Along with the many speakers already appearing at the event are a number of significant additions covering a wide range of backgrounds.  These include Jeff Garzik, bitcoin core developer; Emin Gün Sirer, professor at Cornell University, author of the 'hacking, distributed' website and creator of the term 'selfish mining'; and Jeffrey Smith, from cex.io and ghash.io, who will be making his first public appearance to discuss the 51% issue.  Also now confirmed to appear are bitcoin core developer Peter Todd; Gavin Wood, Ethereum co-founder and CTO; Jeremy Liew, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners; Mathias Kröner, CEO of Fidor Bank; and Geoff Lewis, partner at Founders Fund.  Garzik, who will take part in a panel discussion titled 'Will Bitcoin last the distance?', told CoinDesk that CoinSummit London offers an ""exciting lineup of business all-stars"".  Startup showcase  Alongside all the speakers and panels, CoinSummit will also feature a 'startup showcase', in which new companies in the cryptocurrency space will have the opportunity to pitch their product in front of the entire conference audience.  A number companies competed for the chance to appear, judged by a panel of experts that included entrepreneurs Jimmy Furland and Ben Davenport; Firat Ileri, an investor at Hummingbird Ventures; Martin Mignot, an investor at Index Ventures; Jez San, an angel investor and the founder of PKR.com; and conference organiser Pamir Gelenbe.  All 15 winning startups have now been decided, said Gelenbe. These include companies from across the cryptocurrency spectrum, such as BitPesa, which is taking digital currency into Africa; Holy Transaction with its multi-currency 'universal' wallet; Skyhook, the maker of low-cost, open-source bitcoin ATMs; Coinffeine, a decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency maketplace; and XBTerminal, maker of point-of-sale solutions for bitcoin.  The full list of winning startups can be found on the CoinSummit website.  Crypto and cocktails  The conference has also released new details about its entertainment offerings. To round off the opening day of the conference, all CoinSummit participants will be eligible for a free cocktail from 6pm to 8.30pm.  Furthermore, CoinSummit sponsor Swarm is hosting a conference afterparty on the same day at The Battery Club in Canary Wharf, which starts at 8.30pm.  All are welcome and can sign up here.
