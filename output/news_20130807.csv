42376581,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W35P,1375893485,Could mobile payment Lemon Network be fruitful for bitcoin?,"A new network designed to manage payment credentials could provide a useful backdoor to bitcoin adoption in the future. Lemon Network promises to make mobile payments easier, without tying users to a particular payment processor.  The system emerged from Lemon Wallet, a popular mobile app for the Android and iOS platforms. It was a simple but powerful concept: instead of carrying your various credit, debit, and loyalty cards in your wallet, scan them, and put them on your phone. You can then use your credit cards easily (as long as you don't try to swipe them). It also featured premium services, such as the ability to monitor payment card accounts for fraud, and cancel cards with a single tap.  The app garnered millions of users – a million signed up within the first four months of its October 2011 launch, and it now has over three million. It added receipt scanning, and an update that helped to categorize and filter spending.  Now, company CEO Wences Casares is turning the app into the front end for a payment network that can work with different payment processors – and he wants to enable bitcoin as part of it.  Lemon Network is designed to take the friction out of payments, by eliminating the need to enter information manually. Because Lemon Wallet now holds so much payment card information, the company is courting merchants to connect them with customers. When a merchant enables the Lemon Network, this site will connect with the Wallet app, and enable the user to select whichever payment method they wish, from those stored in the Wallet.  “A merchant that participates in the network, via our SDK, has access to a simple checkout drop-in that simplifies the consumer mobile buying experience, and facilitates a one-tap payment,” says Casares.  He isn't the only person to try and make online payments less painful. Venmo, purchased earlier this year for $26.2 million by Braintree, supplies payment services to clients like AirBnB. That service, along with Stripe, offers one-time data entry, followed by easy, one-tap payments – but they are still payment processors, he says, whereas Lemon is payment processor agnostic.  But what does all this have to do with bitcoin? The Lemon Wallet – and therefore the Lemon Network – doesn’t support bitcoin right now, but Casares says that he wants to support it soon. Bitcoin will be a world-changing technology, he predicts.  “Just like there only one billion fixed-telephone lines worldwide, mostly in the developed world, and the emerging world leapfrogged that technology and went straight to mobile phones, reaching almost six billion now, the same may happen with banking services,” he says.  “There are about one billion people with bank accounts in the world. The rest may leapfrog that old technology and go directly to something like bitcoin, which is much better suited to their need.”  Casares has a history of disrupting financial services markets. The Argentinian-born entrepreneur founded Banco Lemon, a Brazilian bank that directly targeted low-income populations. It used an emerging model known as correspondent banking, which used simple point-of-sale equipment located in 6500 partner organisations, such as business centres, drugstores, and other retail outlets (read an analysis of correspondent banking here). Most of the outlets were located in the suburbs, or in poor downtown neighbourhoods. In short, it used technology to circumvent the barriers involved in creating a financial services network. Sound familiar?  He took this venture, founded in 2002, to a successful exit. It was purchased by Banco do Brasil, the largest bank in Brazil, in 2009, as part of quest to continue moving into untapped low income markets.  “I think Bitcoin is going to do for money what TCP/IP did to information,” Casares told CoinDesk. “[It is] probably the most revolutionary technology since the Internet itself.”  There will be challenges to overcome, of course. Bitcoin's highly centralized development team appears to be less accountable than ever to the broader user base. Its block chain continues to grow, with the potential of crippling the client infrastructure. And the uncertain regulatory landscape is creating a speed bump for the currency’s development: it will be difficult to persuade mainstream merchants and customers to adopt bitcoin until an intuitive infrastructure exists, with easy-to-use services that complement the basic currency system.  No doubt such speed bumps will be overcome. The momentum behind the currency is too great for it to simply flounder and die. But if Casares can bring an easy mobile payment system into the mainstream, grabbing his base of 3 million users, and acquiring a healthy community of merchants, it could be a good opportunity to introduce bitcoin to many people who wouldn't yet have heard of it.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/07/could-mobile-payment-lemon-network-be-fruitful-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c68198ec195517002aca23152b59f1f8f2f10e0-800x562.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376587,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W3ED,1375887542,Coinbase implements zero-fee microtransactions off the block chain,"Coinbase, the bitcoin wallet and exchange payment processor, has announced that it will begin processing off-block chain microtransactions. These transactions will be free for users, and once a user has accumulated 0.01 BTC they can withdraw funds, which then incurs the normal block chain fees.  The new microtransactions are handled internally at Coinbase and are instant. For instance, you can even send a unit as small as a Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC).  This will be a useful feature for Coinbase users because while miner's fees are relatively low for most transactions, they become significant with very small transactions. Therefore in the case of bitcoin dust, the transactions are proportionately high. Indeed, the way in which bitcoin users can avoid fees rules out sending microtransactions with the 0.01 BTC limit.  Economist and bitcoin investor, Tuur Demeester, told us: ""In the same way the internet user today rarely has to pay for the bandwidth costs he's incurring on his favourite websites, bitcoin users can be offered free transactions on their favourite commercial platforms in return for the chance that they'll also make use of the non-free services offered. That is the strategy I see Coinbase developing. I think this shows us the way to the future of bitcoin, in which small or even larger transactions are facilitated off the block chain for free by private parties that have gained the trust of the public. The ultimate clearing of transactions, cryptographically secure and publicly verifiable, will of course always be done by the bitcoin miners.""  Bitcoin entrepreneur Darragh Browne praised Coinbase for developing the new processing facility: ""Coinbase are continuing to innovate in the payments space by being one of the first companies to truly enable micropayments on the web. The idea of grouping many micropayments together into one larger (0.01 BTC) transaction has been explored for some time now and it's fantastic to see Coinbase bringing this feature to end-users!""  Currently Coinbase is only available to US customers.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/07/coinbase-implements-zero-fee-microtransactions-off-the-block-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81867ff8e7dec09d76a54e69c0f39ce506cf2757-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376572,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W2vL,1375879273,US judge rules bitcoin 'is a currency or form of money',"A judge in Texas has ruled that bitcoin is a currency or form of money, which gives the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the go-ahead to sue Ponzi scheme operator Trendon Shavers.  A document signed by US magistrate judge Amos L. Mazzant details the SEC's case against Shavers, founder and operator of Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST), formerly known as First Pirate Savings & Trust.  Shavers enticed people to invest in BTCST with the promise of 1% interest per day. Some investors suffered losses, totalling 263,104 BTC, which equates to around $25 million, based on current exchange rates.  The SEC asserts Shavers defrauded investors and that the BTCST investments are classed as securities, as defined by Federal Securities Laws. Shavers, however, argues the BTCST investments are not securities because bitcoin is not money, nor is it part of anything regulated by the US authorities.  The court document states: ""Bitcoin is a currency or form of money, and investors wishing to invest in BTCST provided an investment of money. … For these reasons, the Court finds that it has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter.  Upon viewing a summary of the ruling, Constance Choi, general counsel at Payward Inc, said that this ruling signals that state courts and regulators are starting to pay attention to bitcoin and beginning to take positions on where it fits within existing legal regimes and asset classes.  ""In this case, one judicial authority in Texas appears to have preliminarily classified it as currency or form of money. By labelling it as a 'currency', this Texas court is in direct contradiction of the FinCEN guidance, which expressly stated that virtual currencies like bitcoin are not 'currency', such as legal tender or fiat currencies,"" she added.  Choi went on to say it is important to note that, if this is a lower court ruling, it has limited power of enforcement and may be overturned by a higher court on appeal.  ""Lower court rulings are preliminary findings by one court, which must withstand further scrutiny and often legal challenges in the form of appeals to its validity. And it only informs one state's definition, which will apply only in that one state,"" she explained.  This ruling indicates that the proper definition and regulation of bitcoin is being seriously considered at the state level. ""[This] underscores the need for the industry to educate the public – from users to policymakers – to ensure that when such laws or rulings are made, they are made with full understanding of the technology, including the real benefits and risks, rather than ill-informed perceived ones,"" Choi concluded.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/07/us-judge-rules-bitcoin-is-a-currency-or-form-of-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/906ca9eb81043c66d4095933332edf342cbfdf3c-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
