The agreement would include the creation of metal-backed tokens on the global Atomyze platform that represents physical assets in digital form.  The RSBN and Atomyze platforms have been built on IBM blockchain technology and powered by the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric.  By joining the RSBN, Nornickel has agreed to have its supply chains audited annually against key responsible-sourcing requirements by RCS Global.  ""We believe that the digital technologies of RSBN and Atomyze will create the path for Nornickel and its partners to participate in a circular value chain, tracing commodity flows in near real-time as well as replacing cumbersome paperwork,"" said Anton Berlin, Nornickel's vice president of sales and distribution.  In December 2019, one of the largest cobalt producers, Glencore PLC, joined the RSBN, announcing it would use RSBN’s Hyperledger Fabric platform for its cobalt production and become a full consortium member.

The trend of digital commerce is growing and RBW wants to stay on top of these trends while at the same time open new markets when possible.”      The exact time of when the NFTs will be launched has yet to be announced. Xeno told CoinDesk that the underlying digital products will include ""3D model renderings"" of fans' favorite K-Pop idols, event tickets for virtual concerts and membership tokens that ""allow artists to engage their fanbases"".      RBW’s move comes at a time of explosive growth in trading volumes for NFTs, which tripled in 2020 compared to 2019, according to data from Dune Analytics. The increased interest in NFTs is partly driven by the COVID-19 pandemic that has forced most cancellation of in-person events.      Unlike fungible cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, NFTs are unique tokens that cannot be exchanged one to one. For fans of Mamamoo, that translates into ownership of a unique digital product developed around the singers.      Xeno’s NFT marketplace launched last month after the company saw a potentially huge market for NFTs in East Asia, Xeno's president, Anthony Di Franco, told CoinDesk. The company currently operates primarily in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea.

The East Asian country also has “very high engagement” with all forms of entertainment including the K-Pop industry. The Gaon Digital Chart, South Korea's music industry standard ranking recorded singles, shows nearly 21 million weekly plays for this week's No. 1 song alone.      RBW’s news could lead more prominent entertainment companies in East Asia to follow the NFT trend, as most live events around the world are still on pause due to the pandemic, according to the executives at Xeno. Besides those in K-Pop, several partnerships with well-established names in high fashion and the online gaming industries are already “in the pipeline,"" the exchange said.      “RBW is a fairly moderately impactful company, with popular girl group Mamamoo along with several boy bands and a new girl group, Purple Kiss, under its management,” Tamar Herman, K-Pop journalist at Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, told CoinDesk in an email. “The company has a reputation for high-value performances and artistry.”      While most NFT exchanges are based on the Ethereum blockchain, Xeno is built on the Polkadot network because of its better scalability, full cross-chain interoperation and integration, and Polkadot’s unique “parachain” feature that gives the team full control of the protocol layer of the system, Di Franco told CoinDesk.

The article has been updated.      UPDATE 2 (Jan. 17, 2021, 3:10 UTC): Xeno's deal is with RBW's Japanese subsidiary. The article was updated to clarify.      UPDATE 3 (Jan 17, 2020, 18:29 UTC): After this story was published, Xeno contacted CoinDesk to retract their initial implication that Mamamoo was part of this deal.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | EXCHANGE,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/16/k-pop-stars-to-mint-digital-collectibles-on-polkadot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b2706c84b1b08666282e10fa692d4beb5434991-1024x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
