42433275,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4Llh,1606948621,US Lawmakers Introduce Bill That Would Require Stablecoin Issuers to Obtain Bank Charters,"A new U.S. congressional bill would require stablecoin issuers to secure bank charters and secure regulatory approval prior to circulating any stablecoins.      U.S. Representatives Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) introduced the Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement (STABLE) Act on Wednesday, writing in a press release that it would focus on regulating stablecoins, naming the stablecoin of the Facebook-led Libra project (since renamed Diem) as one example.      “Digital currencies, whose value is permanently pegged to or stabilized against a conventional currency like the dollar, pose new regulatory challenges while also represent a growing source of the market, liquidity, and credit risk,” the press release said.      The 18-page bill would specifically require stablecoin issuers to obtain a banking charter; require approval from the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the issuer’s specific state or federal bank regulator; require those same entities to conduct an ongoing analysis of any systemic risk; and require issuers to have FDIC insurance or maintain reserves for easy conversion back into U.S. dollars.      Read more: Stablecoins Hit $20B Milestone, a Nearly 300% Year-to-Date Surge      This would apply to stablecoins pegged to other national or state currencies, the bill said.      Chastity Murphy, an economic adviser to Rep. Tlaib, told CoinDesk that both state and federal bank charters would satisfy the bill's requirements.      Rohan Grey, an assistant professor at the Willamette University College of Law in Oregon, told CoinDesk the bill is really defining what a deposit is as far as digital assets are concerned. In his view, stablecoins are effectively an internet-native form of a deposit.      ""Any entity that wants to issue something that walks and talks like money or like a deposit should be regulated like a depository institution,"" he said. Grey is an adviser for the bill.      The press release also mentioned a letter that the sponsors and cosponsors had previously sent to Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks, that questioned the regulator’s focus on the digital asset space. Specifically, the lawmakers took issue with OCC interpretive letters on banks providing custody services to stablecoin issuers and other crypto platforms.    Impact    The bill is designed to protect individuals, Rep. Tlaib said on Twitter and in the press release.      In a tweet she wrote, ""Preventing cryptocurrency providers from repeating the crimes against low- and moderate-income residents of color traditional big banks have is critically important.""      A number of stablecoin issuers currently operate in the U.S. without banking charters, including the CENTRE consortium (which is composed of Circle and Coinbase), Gemini and Paxos. Algorithmic stablecoins like basis.cash or crypto collateral tokens like DAI would also appear to fall under this bill.      ""Any stablecoin that meets the statutory definition is eligible, because the focus is on what the coin promises (i.e., the obligation), not how it claims to be able to enforce the obligation (i.e., the collateral backing). Full-reserve, partial-reserve, algorithmically deteremined basket - these are all asset-side variations. The 'deposit' component focuses on the liability side promise,"" Murphy said.      Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the bill ""would represent a huge step backwards"" by limiting industry innovation.      ""An enormous amount of the innovation brought to the underbanked and small businesses has been driven by non-bank fintech companies, and forcing crypto, fintech and blockchain companies into the enormous regulatory burdens of Federal Reserve and FDIC regulation and supervision is inconsistent with the goals of supporting innovation in the fair and inclusive delivery of payments that comes from stablecoins,"" he said in a statement emailed to CoinDesk.      More effective ways to regulate stablecoins could come from new charters or other types of supervision, he said.      Read more: Ripple CEO Walks Back Threat to Leave US      In a statement, Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith opposed the bill, saying, ""While we have had sustained and constructive discussions with Rep. Tlaib’s office on this issue, we disagree with the perspective of this legislation and oppose this bill. It would strengthen the position of the most powerful financial institutions, while overlooking two core promises of decentralized networks: the chance to put more power in the hands of individual consumers and to catalyze innovation across payments and other financial services.""      Smith said the OCC's guidance around stablecoins was a ""progressive example"" of how these tokens could be regulated in the U.S.      The current congressional session will end in just a few weeks but Murphy said the bill will be introduced again next year.      ""Often there’s a tendency to react in the moment to technological changes or innovation by saying, ‘stop, don’t do that’ and what this bill is trying to do is preserve this in a forward-looking way,"" he said.

42433297,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4MHh,1606944739,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Flat at $19K While Ether Options Traders Bet Bearish on 2021,"Low volumes are keeping the bitcoin market in the $19,000 neighborhood; option traders expect a high ether price in December but aren’t so convinced about next year.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $19,110 as of 21:10 UTC (4:10 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.60% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $18,360-$19,357  BTC near its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a sideways signal for market technicians.    The bitcoin market is taking a bit of a breather Wednesday, with flat price action producing a tighter price range between $18,360 and $19,357 over the past 24 hours. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency is currently at $19,110 as of press time, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The sideways price performance can be partially attributed to lighter volume Wednesday. This was in contrast to earlier in the week, when the exchanges monitored by the CoinDesk 20 experienced two days of over $2 billion in volume. As of press time, daily volume was at $1.1 billion.      “Consolidation continues, judging by the signals from the RSI indicators and Bollinger Bands,” noted Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto-focused investment firm Wave Financial.      The relative strength index, or RSI, is a technical market momentum indicator and Bollinger Bands use standard deviations of moving averages to forecast an asset’s performance. Using these, Kogan anticipates another price push upward. “Potentially, another attempt will be made to break above $20,000,” he added.      Read More: Bitcoin Sees Record Number of Active Users as Price Almost Hits $20K      “Bitcoin is holding the $18,200-$19,700 range, making its new all-time high yesterday, bringing more volatility and making bitcoin more trending than ever before this year,” noted Elie Le Rest, partner at quant trading firm ExoAlpha. The all-time high price record, set Tuesday, is now at $19,920.53 according to CoinDesk 20 data.      “This market environment reminds us of 2017, but this time it’s different as it was not driven only by retail investors rushing into a new gold mine,” added ExoAlpha’s Le Rest.      In the options market, Wednesday is shaping up to be a day heavily favoring puts (66%) versus calls (33%) on bitcoin. This suggests options traders are putting in some protection on possible downsides in price. A put is a bearish bet on the price while a call is a bullish wager.      “Drops happened multiple times during the 2017 rally and we expect them to happen several times again this bull run as part of the natural market cycle,” said Andrew Tu, a representative from quant trading firm Efficient Frontier.      Traders are likely cashing in their winnings Wednesday after a strong November.      “The market did not accelerate when hitting the all-time highs twice, so there is clearly a barrage of profit-taking at this critical and significant level,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of investment firm Tellurian Capital.      Tight range days like Wednesday may just be part of the bitcoin market in December, Bonnefous added. “I suspect consolidation in a range is in order for now until fresh buying comes in.”    Bear mode for ether’s price in 2021?    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $596 and climbing 0.30% in 24 hours as of 21:10 UTC (4:10 p.m. ET).      Read More: Visa May Support USDC Credit Card After Adding Circle to ‘Fast Track’      Ether options traders see a 91% chance of ether over $400 for December 2020 expiration. However, into 2021 those price probabilities drop quite a bit, with traders seeing a 91% chance of ether only over $280 by March 2021 expiration, according to date from aggregator Skew.      “Out to the end of December, there’s a more fair distribution of topside and downside interest,” noted Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. “It could be that the downside is protection-seeking. That picture changes beyond end of year, where from January onward there is a clear favor of high strikes but there's also a lot of open interest in the low strikes.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Wednesday.

But analysts say ether should be judged on its own merits and not as a bitcoin replacement.      “I’ve always thought this digital asset space is huge – and it’s not just bitcoin – because there are going to be different applications for different things,” Raoul Pal, CEO and co-founder of financial media group Real Vision, said in Real Vision’s documentary ""Ethereum – An Investigation,"" which was released on Nov. 30. “I think of the two [bitcoin and ether] as having a very nice combined asset allocation.”      For Pal, an early bitcoin investor, the rationale seems even more plausible these days: As bitcoin’s price hits a new all-time high, the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now more expensive and thus potentially a riskier bet for new investors.      It can be expected investors are looking for a new opportunity in crypto at affordable prices. Given that ether is trading roughly 59% below its all-time high of $1,432.88, it is tempting to believe there’s a bargain to be had. What’s more, the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade to increase the network's scalability, security and energy efficiency has generated a lot of hype.      Read more: Investment Giant AllianceBernstein Now Says Bitcoin Has Role in Investors’ Portfolios      However, at least for now, analysts and traders who spoke with CoinDesk don't think ether will replace the FOMO over bitcoin.      “For institutional investors, they are buying BTC for the digital gold narrative,” Ryan Watkins, senior research analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk. “ETH just isn’t in that conversation yet.”      Ether “benefits from spillover and likely has more conversation around it from crypto-natives,” Vishal Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk. “For the uninitiated, [it is] hard to see how bitcoin is not the sole on-ramp.”    Weakening correlation between bitcoin and ether    Some analysts say that as more institutions pour money into bitcoin and push up its price, ether and other cryptocurrencies will gradually decouple from bitcoin.      Indeed, while bitcoin this week logged a record high price, ether isn't even close to its all-time high of $1,448.18. Data from CoinDesk shows the 90-day correlation coefficient between the prices of the top two cryptocurrencies, while still strong, has gradually weakened a bit since the summer from as high as 0.93 to nearly 0.7 at the beginning of December.      “The thing about correlation is it can disappear at any time,” Ashwath Balakrishnan, research analyst at digital asset research firm Delphi Digital, told CoinDesk. “In that case, you want to understand the core fundamentals of what you hold because if you hold ether as a proxy [to your] bitcoin exposure, and [when] prices decouple, you are now exposed to something very different.”      Bitcoin has been used by many investors this year as a hedge against a drop in the purchasing power of U.S. dollars. Ether is considered the currency of “the world computer,” which aims to build an ecosystem of decentralized applications.      The close historical correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be due to how tiny the digital-asset ecosystem is relative to the global economy. The total market capitalization of crypto assets is estimated at $562 billion, a mere 1.7% of the S&P 500 stock index’s combined market cap of $32.2 trillion. With almost every crypto asset built on different fundamentals, non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies may be trending with bitcoin prices simply because the nascent market is still so small and insular.      Read more: Volume Surge Brings 25% Turnover to ‘CoinDesk 20’      Correlation data doesn't tell the whole story. Prices may move in tandem but the degree to which that happens is another matter. When the explosive decentralized finance (DeFi) boom hit the market during the summer, ether’s price rallied to its highest in more than two years because most DeFi projects are built on the Ethereum blockchain. At the time, bitcoin was struggling to break a similar two-year record.    What Ethereum 2.0 could mean for investors    The market will have to wait and see what kind of real impact the ongoing Ethereum upgrade could have on its native currency because the final phase of the process is scheduled to be completed in 2023. But a major fundamental upgrade on the network underpinning ether could lead its price to move on its own fundamentals, instead of merely following bitcoin’s price.      “The heart of ETH 2.0, which makes the entire system possible, is ether,” according to a report by Messari. “ETH will not only be Ethereum’s native store of value asset and fuel for transactions, but will also be Ethereum’s ultimate source of security from its role in the [proof-of-stake] system.”      Thus, while bitcoin can be seen as somewhere between a store of value and a commodity on the “asset superclass triangle,” ether could ultimately become the first asset to be a combination of all three classes of assets: capital assets, commodities and stores of value.      “When ether’s price starts to be driven by its own catalysts, holding it as a proxy to having BTC exposure will not work as expected,” Balakrishnan added.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/02/why-ethereum-and-bitcoin-are-very-different-investments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa4b8aa93e6af1496c1f45f95350e295a627228d-2000x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433293,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4MDh,1606937766,4 Charts Showing Why Bitcoin Is an Alternative Risk Asset,"Bitcoin is a risk-asset rather than a safe haven. Similar to equities, bitcoin experienced a strong rebound this year as central banks unleashed an unprecedented amount of global liquidity. On the other hand, traditional safe haven assets, such as fixed income and cash, have done their job of producing low but stable returns, which is far from the characteristic of bitcoin.      Investors tend to diversify a portfolio of assets to minimize risk. In the risk bucket, they’ll allocate towards growth stocks, cyclicals and commodities. And in the defensive bucket, you’ll find sovereign debt, high-dividend stocks and cash.    Damanick Dantes, CMT, is a macro trader specializing in commodities, equities and crypto. He previously worked on the global asset allocation research team at Fidelity Investments.    Where does bitcoin fit in?      Alternative assets, such as bitcoin and gold, provide investors with “non-traditional” (uncorrelated) returns. The typical alternative portfolio bucket holds assets for about 10 years, which includes illiquid investments in private equity, real estate and venture capital. However, bitcoin is tradable, which means that it is more liquid – making it a good candidate for long/short strategies typically used by hedge funds.      There’s a new wave of institutional investors in digital assets, and they’re not your typical investment advisers. Large funds that invest in alternatives are starting to view bitcoin as an attractive risk bet in their portfolios. We’re talking about an estimated $14 trillion market in alternative assets by 2023, according to a Preqin survey of institutional investors.      Guggenheim, a global asset management firm, recently announced it may seek indirect exposure to bitcoin. The firm’s Macro Opportunities fund may invest up to 10% of its net asset value in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) – about $497 million. (Grayscale is a sister company to CoinDesk.)      See also: Damanick Dantes – 4 Charts Showing Why Financial Advisers Should Care About Bitcoin      Here are four charts that illustrate bitcoin’s use as an alternative risk asset.      Bitcoin has risen in tandem with the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. After a two-year period of winding down its balance sheet, the Federal Reserve returned in full force this year to resume its asset purchasing program. As a result, the “Fed put” (a belief the Fed is always there to rescue the economy and financial markets) has boosted the appeal of bitcoin as an alternative risk asset.      The number of investor-held bitcoin is rising. Wallets that store bitcoin for the long term are less likely to succumb to profit-taking. This holding trend means that investors are increasingly taking the place of traders as bitcoin matures.      Large owners continue to hold most of bitcoin. Unlike traditional assets, the massive concentration of bitcoin holdings means that a large holder can have an outsized impact on price movement. And this is where alternative portfolio strategies come in.      Bitcoin remains in a long-term uptrend. Systematic portfolios manage volatility by adjusting positions based on price trend. One method is to calculate bitcoin’s market value relative to its realized value (MVRV). The ratio suggests that bitcoin is currently trading above “fair value,” albeit below previous extremes.      These trend systems are commonly used in the managed futures industry which has $303.6 billion in assets under management, a large sum of money that could flow into digital assets.

42433290,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4MBh,1606931279,Blockchain Bites: Record-Breaking 'Active' Bitcoin Users as Wall Street Ponders Mass Adoption,"Hi all, thought we’d try something different in today’s edition of Blockchain Bites. Yesterday and today saw a flurry of news that seemed disparate and unconnected but may actually tell a bigger story about changing institutional attitudes to bitcoin and crypto, generally.      PayPal and BlackRock executives both said that digital assets could have a much larger role in the global financial system. Meanwhile, NYDIG continues to build out crypto-focused investment funds targeting high-net worth individuals.      True to crypto’s roots, adoption won’t only be spearheaded by the billionaire class. Recently, a crowdfunding initiative for a simple crypto app became the most subscribed raise on a U.K. funding platform. Plus, there are now more “active entities” on Bitcoin than ever.      Despite positive news for the spate of adoption, there are still risks in a growing, and relatively young, industry. Microsoft found cryptojacking to be a credible risk for nation-states, and at least some are concerned about what a potential Bitcoin network upgrade could mean for user privacy.    Top shelf    ‘Global asset class’ BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, head of the world’s largest asset manager with $7.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM), said crypto could possibly “evolve” into a global market asset. Speaking to the former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney at the Council on Foreign Relations on Tuesday, Fink also said that despite its small market cap, bitcoin has “caught [people’s] attention,” CNBC reported. He added that digital assets are having a real impact on the U.S. dollar, making it less relevant on a global scale for international holders of dollar-based assets. “Does it change the need for the dollar as a reserve currency?” Fink asked.      Schulman says PayPal CEO and President Dan Schulman said “the time is now” for cryptocurrencies. In front of an estimated 100,000 attendees at the Web Summit, Schulman predicted digital currencies are heading for the mainstream, even becoming a daily payments technology. The coronavirus pandemic ""has pulled these trends forward anywhere between three to five years [and] five to six months,” he said. PayPal only recently opened the floodgates to crypto on its massive ecommerce platform, though Schulman said there’s already 360 million digital wallets. Separately, Mizuho Securities surveyed PayPal users and found about 65% would use bitcoin as a currency at PayPal's 28 million merchants.      Deep pockets New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG) raised $150 million for two new funds to invest in cryptocurrencies, aimed at investors who want to go long on bitcoin. According to two U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, NYDIG Digital Assets Fund I, a fund exclusive to bitcoin, raised $50 million from institutional investors while NYDIG Digital Assets Fund II raised $100 million. Just two unnamed investors appear to have participated in NYDIG’s $50 million bitcoin fund, while it seems its larger brother got all its cash from just one – potentially signally the impact of high-net-worth individuals and companies can have on the bitcoin market.      USDC card Visa will support the issuance of a USDC stablecoin credit card, which could go live in 2021. According to a Wednesday report, Visa is adding support for the digital currency developed by Circle Internet Financial. This means some 60 million merchants can start integrating USDC software into their platforms to send and receive USDC payments. While Visa itself won’t custody any USDC, Circle will be working with Visa to help select Visa credit card issuers get set up. Eventually, Visa’s network will support a credit card that lets businesses send and receive USDC.      Crypto commitments Hong Kong-based Crypto.com has secured an Australian Financial Service License through its acquisition of a firm called The Card Group Pty Ltd. No details on the acquisition were provided, though with a working regulatory arrangement Crypto.com plans to launch a debit card in Australia. ""We are committed to accelerating the world’s transition to cryptocurrency. Working within the regulatory frameworks of the markets we operate in is a key pillar of achieving our mission,"" said Kris Marszalek, Crypto.com CEO.      Crypto crowdfund Ziglu, a U.K.-based app that allows users to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies, has raised $14.8 million from some 1,250 investors in a crowdfunding campaign, the largest equity raise on the Seedrs platform this year. Ziglu had aimed to raise a modest £1 million ($1.34 million) but hit this target within three hours of the campaign opening, eventually closing five times oversubscribed. The average investment amount was $6,445, Ziglu Chief Growth Officer Yang Li said. “I am blown away by just the reception and the support we’ve gotten from the community about our crowdfunding campaign,” Li said. Ziglu is one of many easy-to-use platforms, like PayPal, that let users gain exposure to crypto while simultaneously limiting its use.      Bitcoin use Bitcoin’s use is at an all-time high. The cryptocurrency now has 432,451 “active entities,” or wallet clusters controlled by a single participant used within a 24-hour period, according to analytics firm Glassnode. The previous peak of 410,972 was registered on Dec. 9, 2017. Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, said the rise in use has slowly accreted since the Bitcoin network halving event last spring, rather than just following bitcoin’s price rally. “While the metric has breached highs not seen since 2017, it has done so gradually without ‘bubble-like’ growth,” Dibb said. “We take comfort in this when correlating address clusters with forward-looking price action.” Bitcoin printed a record high of $19,920,53 on Tuesday before falling back.      Privacy scare? Bitcoin experts say privacy concerns over a coming network upgrade called Taproot are overblown. In a recently circulating slideshow, Blockchair’s lead developer Nikita Zhavoronkov argues that Taproot introduces a new “script” to Bitcoin, a way to program how coins can be spent, thereby adding another way to identify users and making Taproot coins distinctly identifiable from other bitcoins. “What Nikita describes is a non-issue,” pseudonymous bitcoin educator and privacy guru 6102 said, as there are already many, many scripts – another addition won’t matter. Taproot, long in the making, is meant to boost Bitcoin’s scalability, and may in fact improve its privacy.      Monero decoy Microsoft warns that cryptojacking is giving nation-state hackers a decoy for more malicious attacks. According to a new report, the company’s intelligence team said a group called BISMUTH hit government targets in France and Vietnam with relatively conspicuous monero mining trojans this summer. Mining the crypto generated side cash for the group, but it also distracted victims from BISMUTH’s true campaign: credential theft.    Quick bites  LOWER RISK? Missed the bitcoin rally?

42411934,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhE4Q,1606927246,What Is Sharding?,"“Sharding” is a proposed method of splitting the infrastructure of Ethereum into smaller pieces with the goal of scaling the platform so it can support many more users than it currently does.  Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain and was designed to make it easier to build decentralized applications that would give users more control over their finances and online data, among other envisioned benefits. The idea is these decentralized alternatives will spread, offering an alternative to apps – such as Robinhood or Twitter – that have a centralized point of control. Ethereum would thus serve as a “world computer,” open to all, that cannot be shut down.  However, in order to be able to offer strong alternatives to existing apps, Ethereum will need to be able to store massive amounts of data. For traditional apps, services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) store petabytes of data from thousands of applications. Right now, though, Ethereum is far from being able to store data as efficiently as a centralized web service like AWS. In fact, Ethereum has historically suffered platform-stopping performance lapses due to a single app taxing the network.  Sharding is one possible method of enabling Ethereum to store more data, a step it needs to take before its method of running decentralized apps, or “dapps,” will be able to go mainstream.  Read more: What Is a Dapp? Decentralized Apps Explained  Where is Ethereum data stored?  If you replace intermediary services for applications, where is all the data stored?  Under the hood, Ethereum is made up of a global network of nodes run by Ethereum users and companies. Each node stores Ethereum's entire history. That means it stores all the data – which person sent a transaction on which date and how much money they sent – as well as smart contracts, code written to administer those funds with certain rules.  As you can imagine, this is a lot of data.  Why do multiple nodes need to store this entire elephant-sized history? This is what makes Ethereum decentralized, able to create applications that ""no one can take down,"" as the primary Ethereum website puts it.  Read more: How Does Ethereum Work?  If only a few people are capable of running these nodes because they're so large, for instance, then the network is easier for individuals, or groups, to manipulate. If a single bad actor could commandeer enough of the nodes, they could rewrite Ethereum's history. Theoretically, that could empower a person to give himself more money at the expense of other Ethereum users.  That's why the easier it is to run these nodes, the less likely that scenario will happen because control is in the hands of more users. In turn, that makes it more likely that ether (or any cryptocurrency) can live up to its bold promises.  The problem is, these nodes typically require heavy-duty storage space and are complex to run and maintain.  Why does Ethereum need sharding?  Sharding could make running these full nodes easier.  According to block explorer Etherscan, Ethereum full nodes already take up at least five terabytes of space, which is about 10 times what the average computer can hold.  And the nodes are only going to grow bigger and harder to run over time and as more users join the platform.  Sharding is a common technique in computer science for scaling applications so they can support more data. If sharding can be properly implemented in Ethereum – which is still a big if – each user could store just a part of the history of changes to the database, as opposed to the entire thing, which is how a blockchain typically works.  Read more: Cardano vs. Ethereum: Can ADA Solve Ether’s Problems?  Why isn't sharding a quick fix?  Sharding is harder than it sounds.  Let's say we split up an Ethereum node – or ""sharded"" it – into six pieces.  Piece one needs to be able to know the data coming from the other five nodes is correct. Otherwise it could be tricked into thinking a change was made that didn't really occur. This turns out to be a hard problem to solve, and developers are still seeking a solution.  When will sharding go live on Ethereum?  Sharding has been an idea since Ethereum emerged in 2013. It is still not clear yet whether it will work. Also, it's not clear when it will be added to Ethereum.  Sharding is a planned part of Ethereum 2.0, a series of upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain that officially began rolling out on Dec. 1, 2020. Sharding is more likely to be incorporated in the later stages of the upgrade because of its potential dangers and complexity. The official site of Ethereum expects sharding to ship sometime in 2023.  Further reading on Ethereum  CoinDesk Crash Course: Ethereum 101  A visual guide on everything Ethereum.

42433283,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4Lxh,1606926245,"$10.8M Stolen, Developers Implicated in Alleged Smart Contract 'Rug Pull'","Another decentralized finance (DeFi) project was rug-pulled Tuesday, with some $10.8 million in investor funds stolen due to a hidden backdoor in the project's smart contracts.      Compounder Finance – a self-described clone of Harvest and Yearn Finance built by pseudonymous programmers – had its contracts drained of $750,000 worth of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), $4.8 million ether, $5 million dai and a small assortment of other tokens, according to an address associated with the exploit.      And while the attack looks similar to other DeFi rug-pulls or exploits, performed time and time again in 2020, this act of thievery is different because of the apparent con Compounder’s developers were playing, according to Robert Leshner, founder of lending protocol Compound Finance.      Read more: DeFi Exploits Can’t Be Pinned on Flash Loans, Industry Leaders Say      In a phone interview, Leshner told CoinDesk Compounder looked like any other yield farming DeFi project that took the cryptocurrency industry by storm this past summer. But the developers had snuck in a call function that allowed them to withdraw all funds from the project – an action a decentralized finance project should never allow – whenever they deemed the booty large enough.    Rug pull    That threshold was apparently met Tuesday, even though Compounder’s token contracts were only created Nov. 10, according to Etherscan.      Leshner called the rug-pull “one of the largest '' purposeful cryptocurrency exploits in recent memory; an exploit categorically different from other DeFi exploits because of its patient endgame. He also alleges that Compounder “impersonated [Compound Finance’s] name” in order to lure in more victims.      A Telegram group of investors is currently investigating legal moves against the developers, although little information is known about the faces behind Compounder. One investor who claims to have lost $1 million in funds is offering a $50,000 bounty for information leading to the seizure of stolen funds.      Compounder’s native token, CP3R, is down 98.8% in the last 24 hours and is now trading hands at $0.24, according to CoinGecko.    Smart contract audits not enough    Compounder was audited by Solidity Finance. Audits are typically seen as an act of good faith in the wild west of DeFi. Solidity Finance told CoinDesk it found the time-locked contract in question as early as mid-November and flagged it to the project’s developers. It offered documentation as well.      Unfortunately, Compounder not only knew about the function, but apparently had plans for it.      “The Compounder team swapped the safe and audited Strategy contracts and replaced them with malicious 'Evil Strategy' contracts that allowed them to steal users funds,” Solidity Finance told CoinDesk in a Telegram message, adding:      “They did this through a public, though clearly unmonitored, 24-hour timelock. This issue of centralized control by the C3PR team was raised in our audit report and our discussions with their team. The team had the power to update strategy pools and they did so maliciously here to steal users’ funds.” In other words, investors overlooked the security hole even though the time lock in question was flagged by the audit.      Many DeFi investors are learning audits don’t necessarily equate to a secure protocol. Akropolis Finance stands as another recent example. It was hacked earlier last month for $2 million worth of dai, even though its contracts had been audited by two firms.      Indeed, audits come in different flavors. Solidity Finance told CoinDesk it was mainly looking for “external attackers.” The firm plans on providing more information on possible “risks stemming from developers’ control” going forward.      Correction (Dec. 3, 2020 19:40 UTC): A previous version of this article stated that the time lock function was only disclosed too Compounder Finance's team.

Effective Dec. 17, any shareholders as of Dec. 14 will receive eight additional ETHE shares for each one held, with each being a ninth the value and price of the present unsplit shares.  ETHE, a vehicle for investors to gain exposure to ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, currently has 29.5 million shares outstanding with each share representing ownership of 0.09284789 ETH.  When the stock split takes effect, there will be 265.5 million ETHE shares with each representing 0.01031643 of an ether token, a ninth of its current value.  In a stock split, though, there are more shares outstanding, each new share is proportionally less valuable.  Companies typically split their shares to increase the number of shares in circulation, thus boosting liquidity.  In addition, by making each share a fraction of the value price of the original share, it makes the split shares more affordable to retail investors, who may have been put off by the price of the unsplit shares.  Shares of ETHE are at $109.10, up $0.11. Year to date, the shares have risen about 350%, largely in line with the price of ETH, also up about 350%.

42423991,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2j41h,1606918862,First Mover: Short Shrift for XRP Token's 169% Price Surge as Traders Obsess Over Bitcoin,"Bitcoin was higher, in an indecisive-looking market swinging between about $18,300 and $19,300. Prices have failed to push higher after surging to a new all-time high of $19,920 earlier this week.  ""Expect additional short-term volatility,"" Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey.  In traditional markets, European stocks slipped and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open as lawmakers discussed new economic stimulus measures and traders awaited new data on U.S. jobs growth during November. Gold strengthened 0.7% to $1,827 an ounce.  The 10-year U.S. breakeven rate, representing inflation expectations as implied by bond markets, rose to 1.81% on Tuesday, the highest since July 2019.  Market moves  As bitcoin dominated headlines in November with its rally toward an all-time high, one of the most prominent alternative cryptocurrencies, XRP, quietly jumped 169% during the month to top the performance rankings among digital assets in the CoinDesk 20.  The move left XRP, the payments token used in Ripple’s global payments network, up 225% in 2020, versus the older and larger bitcoin’s 165% gain. XRP has a market capitalization of $21.4 billion, a fraction of bitcoin’s roughly $350 billion.  The frenzy may be driven by a looming airdrop of free “spark” tokens to anyone who holds XRP, some digital-markets analysts told CoinDesk last month.  There’s also the possibility that some first-time cryptocurrency buyers are unaware it’s possible to buy a fraction of a bitcoin – divisible up to the eighth decimal – instead of a whole token. For the novice investor, XRP, currently changing hands at 62.3 cents, looks a lot cheaper on a price table than bitcoin’s $19,087.  “As the digital asset space has seen renewed interest in the second half of 2020, a new wave of investors are looking for ways to get exposure,” said Brian Mosoff, CEO of the publicly traded Canadian investment fund Ether Capital. “Ripple appears to offer exposure in their portfolio, and a quick Google search may result in some users believing XRP is cheap and likely to become a product banks utilize for cross-border settlement.”  Stellar, another payments token founded by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb, was the second-best performer in November among the CoinDesk 20, gaining 153%. It’s up 313% on the year.

The news was first reported by Forbes.    While Visa itself won’t custody any USDC, Circle will be working with Visa to help certain Visa credit card issuers integrate the USDC software into their platforms and send and receive USDC payments.  Eventually, Visa will support the issuance of a credit card that lets businesses send and receive USDC payments directly from any business using the card.  Circle spokesperson Josh Hawkins confirmed the move via email, saying the companies were targeting a 2021 launch.  The companies will develop a corporate card that would let users spend USDC at vendors who accept Visa cards.  Visa head of crypto Cuy Sheffield confirmed the news on Twitter, writing: ""Circle will issue the first Visa corporate card connected to USDC to enable their business clients to spend USDC from their corporate treasury at 60M merchants.""  Visa's rules require that cards in the U.S. be formally issued by a bank, so Circle will need one as a partner to launch this product. Hawkins said the company is not yet disclosing issuing details.

The funding round comes as the field of DEX aggregators – basically, front-ends for optimizing trading across the top protocols in decentralized finance (DeFi) – has grown increasingly crowded. The deal was structured as a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT), Kunz said through a spokesperson.      “We have recently released version 2 of our protocol and there are several more products in the pipeline, which we’ll reveal soon,” Kunz said in a statement, promising to come up with “solutions that will really make a difference in the DeFi space.”      Read more: DEX Aggregator Rebrands to Slingshot After Raising $3.1M From Coinbase Ventures, Others      The v2 includes a new API, dubbed Pathfinder, which 1inch says provides better routing between DEXs and supports 21 protocols, ranging from Balancer to Mooniswap. The algorithm is capable of packing, unpacking and migrating collateral tokens from Aave and Compound as part of the swap path, 1inch said.      Paul Veradittakit, a partner at Pantera Capital, said 1inch is providing users “with powerful routing and trading infrastructure behind the scenes to get them the best rates.”      When asked how 1inch stands out from other DEX aggregators, Aleks Larsen, the general partner of Blockchain Capital’s venture funds, said the firm has ""a bold vision to build the first vertically integrated DeFi platform.""      ""We believe they are well-positioned to continue their leadership in DEX aggregation and expand the depth and breadth of their product offerings across DeFi markets,"" he told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

Interviewed by New York Times columnist Andrew Ross-Sorkin for the online 2020 tech conference, Schulman anticipated digital currencies soon entering the mainstream and becoming an everyday payments tool. The global coronavirus pandemic has accelerated various trends, such as consumers ""abandoning cash,"" he said.      The coronavirus pandemic ""has pulled these trends forward anywhere between three to five years [and] five to six months,"" according to Schulman.      He continued:    ""I think that if you can create a financial system, a new and modern technology that is faster, that is less expensive, more efficient, that's good for bringing more people into the system, for inclusion, to help drive down costs, to help drive financial health for so many people... So, over the long run, I'm very bullish on digital currencies of all kinds.""    PayPal announced in October it will begin allowing users to transact with cryptocurrency as a funding instrument across 28 million merchants early next year. The company is already allowing customers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies inside the PayPal wallet, starting in the U.S. Schulman said the company conducted market research in advance that showed 54% of PayPal’s base wanted the crypto offerings.      ""As we thought about it, digital wallets are a natural complement to digital currencies. We've got over 360 million digital wallets and we need to embrace cryptocurrencies,"" said the PayPal CEO.      Bitcoin's volatility had previously been Schulman's primary concern, prompting him to consider it a ""poor form of currency"" with the potential to wipe out small merchants' profits. In order to tackle this issue, PayPal will allow consumers to know the exact exchange rate of crypto at the moment of a purchase, removing the volatility risk.

After being discussed and given the initial thumbs-up by lawmakers Wednesday, the Draft Bill on Virtual Assets now has two more hearings before it can become law.      If that happens, Ukraine will join the still-short list of nations that have put in place dedicated laws regulating cryptocurrencies. The country was named a global leader in crypto adoption by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis in September when citizens were actively using crypto for savings, investment and cross-border trade.      Things were not completely smooth for the bill during the parliamentary hearing: Some lawmakers decried spending time on virtual assets when there are more important issues besetting the Ukrainian economy. However, in the end, the bill received 229 “yes” votes out of 340 and passed this first stage of the legislative process.      The bill defines virtual assets as “a set of data in electronic form,” which “can be an independent object of civil transactions, as well as certify property or non-property rights.” The law suggests not considering virtual assets as legal tender in Ukraine.      The document singles out virtual assets backed by goods or services, suggesting they must be taken out of the market in cases where the backing ceases to exist.      The ownership of virtual assets is considered as being the entity holding the private keys, unless they are held with a custodian, forfeited by the court decision or acquired illegally.      Virtual assets would be regulated by Ukraine’s Ministry of the Digital Transformation, and crypto service providers must register to be able to operate in the nation. Firms must provide information on ownership structure and beneficiaries, as well as ensure they don’t facilitate money laundering and are diligently protecting users' personal data.      Also read: Why Ukraine Is Ripe for Cryptocurrency Adoption      The Ukrainian crypto community sometimes finds itself at a disadvantage on global trading platforms. For example, in September, Bittrex temporarily stopped serving users from Ukraine, along with Belarus, Burundi, Mali, Myanmar, Nicaragua and Panama. The exchange did not give specific reasons, citing only “the current regulatory environment” in the affected jurisdictions.

42433295,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4MFh,1606912239,Introducing Valid Points: The Risks and Rewards of Staking on Eth 2.0,"It’s alive! Welcome, everyone, to the first edition of Valid Points, CoinDesk's ongoing effort to chronicle the evolution of Ethereum 2.0. You can sign up for the newsletter here.      Today we're commemorating the launch of Ethereum 2.0, which marks the beginning of Ethereum’s live transformation into a proof-of-stake blockchain. The new blockchain is said to be several times more efficient, scalable and secure than the current decentralized application network.      While Ethereum 2.0 will take years to build out fully, its first phase of development, phase 0, is now officially underway. With the activation of phase 0, there's a new use case for Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ether. It’s called staking.      What is staking? How does it work? What is the risk/reward profile of using ether to stake on Ethereum 2.0? These are a few of the pressing questions that we’ll start to unpack over the next several months. We’ll also discuss the ramifications of Ethereum 2.0 development on the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, as well as on the competitive landscape of smart contract blockchain platforms.      Our newsletter, chronicling the progress of Ethereum 2.0, beginning with its launch, will go out every Wednesday. To support our coverage of the network, CoinDesk will be staking its own funds – 32 ETH to be exact. The goal: Deepen CoinDesk’s editorial coverage of Ethereum 2.0 and gain an unvarnished perspective on the next major iteration of the Ethereum blockchain. To that end, we’ll also be donating all proceeds from our staked ETH to charity. Read more about CoinDesk’s fact-finding mission on Ethereum 2.0 here.      Now, let’s get started!    Pulse check    There is a total of 900,129 ETH (roughly $532 million at time of writing) staked on Ethereum 2.0. That is 66% above the initial target for network launch.      With more than enough funds and user participation to secure network operations, Ethereum 2.0 has successfully worked through its first epoch, meaning it has worked through its first cycle for creating and processing new blocks.      As of 22:58 UTC on Dec. 1, a total of 100 epochs have been finalized through the participation of 21,291 validators. Validators can be thought of as the equivalent to miners on Ethereum who are responsible for securing the network and its data.      Active validators on Ethereum 2.0 are, on average, earning 0.00403 ETH/day, or $2.36/day at time of writing, for their participation on the network. This amount will likely decrease as the number of validators on the network rises.      Each day, a maximum of 900 new validators can be onboarded to Ethereum 2.0. There are approximately 6,200 validators in the activation queue as of Tuesday waiting for entry into the network... and the CoinDesk Eth 2.0 validator is one of them.      Read more on the status of our Eth 2.0 validator below.    Charting new frontiers    If you had invested in ether on Jan. 1, you’d be up 364% to date, according to the CoinDesk 20.      And while that’s impressive, assets built on top of the Ethereum blockchain have seen even greater gains this year. Take, for example, this DeFi ""blue chip"" token: YFI – robo-hedge fund Yearn Finance’s governance token that didn’t exist a year ago – is up 2,300%, per Messari. Overall, the DeFi asset class is up 456% year to date against the dollar.      But not all were lucky: Lending protocol Compound’s token COMP dropped off a cliff after a very productive summer, down 55% year to date.      Hits and misses with Ethereum tokens, and DeFi in general, may have some investors looking for more stable returns, particularly ones with less software risk. Which takes us to Ethereum 2.0 also known as Serenity, a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain promising stable returns on ETH deposits.    Stake it, baby    The proximity of “DeFi Summer” and Eth 2.0’s launch makes the pair a relatively straightforward comparison: If you have a DeFi coin sitting around, you’re more than likely to have some ether. Luckily for DeFi traders, the niche industry’s first bear market coincided with Ethereum’s relaunch and subsequent reward distribution.      A PoS network, Eth 2.0’s rewards are denominated in ether and adhere to a distribution curve dependent on participation and average percent of stakers. A lot of Ethereum developers like to compare it to a bond, although this bond’s expiry relies more on GitHub pull requests merging on time than a corporate clerk mailing out checks.      When annualized, rewards per epoch (a period of time during which transactions are proposed and validated by token deposits) are competitive against some DeFi project rewards.      Indeed, Eth 2.0 staking rewards start at some 20% for early stakers. They will continue to drop as more validators join the network to between 7% and 4.5% annually.      For comparison, a snapshot of DeFi yields from more trusted projects shows yields sitting around 5%–7%, according to DeFi Rate. That’s not to say you can’t still find higher yield, but you do take on software risk which has determined the fate of many a DeFi project this year.    Eth 2.0: Risk and reward    Staking is risky as well, complete with different trade-offs from DeFi. Not only can your initial deposit be slashed for failing to keep up with the network, but hidden software risks still exist.      Each Eth 2.0 validator has to choose its own specification to work with from five different teams that programmed Eth 2.0 in various languages. Those specifications could have exploitable flaws, regardless of how smoothly testing went throughout the second half of 2020. That’s one reason staking rewards are set so high by developers.      Some clients, moreover, were late to join the deposit contract party, leading to investors missing out on early high-yield opportunities. For example, Prysmatic Labs had breaking changes in its final implementation of the Eth 2.0 spec. Unfortunately, the client was not ready until after the deposit contract was filled up. Eager validators, including CoinDesk, are in queue for validation but will miss out on at least the first week’s juicy rewards.      Staking in Eth 2.0 also means your ether is locked up for months to years. You can look at it, but you can’t touch it.      Secondary markets might be able to address concerns around the lock-up period, however. For example, Coinbase chief product officer Surojit Chatterjee announced yesterday the intention to create a market for staked ether, also known as Beacon Chain ETH (BETH) in a blog post. It’ll be interesting to see how liquid a BETH market becomes compared to other tokens, given the inherent counterparty risk associated with staking.      Thanks for reading.

42433289,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4M7h,1606910400,XRP Led November's Crypto Bull Run With 169% Gain,"As bitcoin dominated headlines in November with its rally toward an all-time high, one of the most prominent alternative cryptocurrencies, XRP, quietly jumped 169% during the month to top the performance rankings among digital assets in the CoinDesk 20.      The move left XRP, the payments token used in Ripple’s global payments network, up 225% in 2020, versus the older and larger bitcoin’s 165% gain. XRP has a market capitalization of $21.4 billion, a fraction of bitcoin’s roughly $350 billion.      The frenzy in XRP may be driven by a looming airdrop of free ""spark"" tokens to anyone who holds XRP, some digital-markets analysts told CoinDesk last month.      There’s also the possibility that some first-time cryptocurrency buyers are unaware that it’s possible to buy a fraction of a bitcoin – divisible up to the eighth decimal, instead of a whole token. For the novice investor, XRP, currently changing hands at 62.3 cents, looks a lot cheaper on a price table than bitcoin’s $19,087.      “As the digital asset space has seen renewed interest in the second half of 2020, a new wave of investors are looking for ways to get exposure,” said Brian Mosoff, CEO of the publicly traded Canadian investment fund Ether Capital. “Ripple appears to offer exposure in their portfolio, and a quick Google search may result in some users believing XRP is cheap and likely to become a product banks utilize for cross-border settlement.”      Stellar, another payments token founded by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb, was the second-best performer in November among the CoinDesk 20, gaining 153%. It’s up 313% on the year.      For comparison, bitcoin rallied 40% in November while ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, rose 56%.      Ether Capital’s Mosoff, for what it’s worth, says he’s skeptical of XRP’s gains.      “Ripple has struggled to gain widespread institutional adoption despite years of effort,” Mosoff said.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,"Bradley Keoun, Zack Seward",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/02/xrp-led-novembers-crypto-bull-run-with-169-gain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b08b9f761b99c5c70ef50b2ff8e5d662c4c545a-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As of Tuesday, there were 432,451 ""active entities"" – wallet clusters controlled by a single participant that sent or received funds in a 24-hour period. That's an all-time high, according to data provided by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The previous peak of 410,972 was registered on Dec. 9, 2017.      ""The number of active entities has been increasing steadily since the halving and signifies a large increase in network adoption by participants,"" said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.      Bitcoin underwent its third mining reward halving on May 11 of this year. Since then, the number of active entities has increased by 70% and bitcoin's price has more than doubled to nearly $20,000.      The cryptocurrency printed a record high of $19,920,53 on Tuesday before falling back. Bitcoin was trading around $19,130 at time of writing, representing a 1.7% gain on the day.      While bitcoin's price gains have been relatively sharp over the past eight weeks, the number of active entities has charted relatively steady growth. ""While the metric has breached highs not seen since 2017, it has done so gradually without 'bubble-like' growth,"" Dibb told CoinDesk. ""We take comfort in this when correlating address clusters with forward-looking price action.""      Analysts consider increased activity as a bullish sign.

NPEX said in the announcement it brought Dusk into the fold to help digitize and grow its platform. ""We want to accelerate our growth and contribute more to the sector,"" said NPEX CEO Mark van der Plas. ""Especially during the pandemic, we see a lot of demand for better access to finance and investing ... technology plays a vital role in this.""      Dusk also sees the share acquisition as a ""strategic move,"" one where joining forces with NPEX will help ""innovate the financial sector.""      “As partner and shareholder, we have developed pilot projects to digitize NPEX’s services and infrastructure,"" said Jelle Pol, managing director at Dusk. ""Our prior experience enables us to quickly add value to the platform in the EU, using our technology.""      According to the companies, the tokenization of digital shares will allow for transactions and trades to be conducted on the exchange in smaller quantities. Dividend payments and expensive processes resulting from shareholder meetings can also be automated.

The error saw names and addresses placed in the ""to"" section rather than individually addressing each recipient or using blind carbon copy.    The emails were sent out in batches of 1,000 recipients and meaning the exposure to a bad actor was limited to the data of 999 individuals per email.

The support from some 1,250 investors brings Ziglu’s total fundraising to $14.8 million.      As for why the offering seemed to command attention on Seedrs: It’s good timing for the crypto app, which former Starling Bank CTO Mark Hipperson launched in June of this year. Apps like PayPal, Square and Revolut are embracing bitcoin and its price is near all-time highs.      “I am blown away by just the reception and the support we’ve gotten from the community about our crowdfunding campaign,” said Ziglu Chief Growth Officer Yang Li.      Read more: Just-Launched Ziglu Wants to Make It Stupid Easy to Buy Crypto      Ziglu had aimed to raise a modest £1 million ($1.34 million) but hit this target within three hours of the campaign opening.      “We weren’t being purposefully coy to set our target at £1 million,” Li said. “I was thinking it would be nice if we could get halfway there by the end of the week. And then we blew the gates apart.”      The crowdfund turned out to be five times oversubscribed. The average investment amount was $6,445, Li said.      Ziglu allows users to buy, hold and sell bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin and XRP. Earlier this year, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approved the payments platform as an Electronic Money Institution.      The momentum created by the crowdfunding, plus the febrile atmosphere around a gathering crypto bull run, has also seen Ziglu’s user numbers spike.      “We were ranked as high as number five on the App Store and we are seeing a huge upsurge in user numbers,” said Li. “We’ve doubled the number of users in the past couple of weeks.”      EDIT (Feb. 8, 2021): Removed reference to Mark Hipperson being a co-founder of Starling Bank.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | FIAT | LTC | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/02/crypto-buying-app-ziglu-bags-largest-raise-of-2020-on-uk-crowdfunding-site-seedrs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4afc4da44257d31cdb0259636ee1d16bb32b71ab-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433248,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO4HJh,1606885307,Institutional Bitcoin Shop NYDIG Raises $150M for Twin Crypto Funds,"New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG) raised $150 million for two new funds to invest in cryptocurrencies, a move that underscores the one-stop crypto shop's skyrocketing clout on the institutional bitcoin scene.      As revealed in two U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, NYDIG Digital Assets Fund I raised $50 million from institutional investors while NYDIG Digital Assets Fund II raised $100 million.      A source familiar with the matter confirmed to CoinDesk that Fund I invests entirely in bitcoin. The source said it is NYDIG's latest offering for a growing lineup of institutional clients going long on BTC.      It was not immediately clear whether Fund II also invests solely in the market-leading cryptocurrency.      But more intriguing than the size of the two new NYDIG offerings are the identity of the whales who bought in. Just two unnamed investors appear to have participated in NYDIG's $50 million bitcoin fund, while it seems its larger brother got all its cash from just one.      The funds capture the extent to which deep-pocketed players are powering the 2020 bull run. Corporations making the crypto their treasury reserve, storied investors pumping their bags on CNBC and institutions piling in have combined to push BTC to new all-time highs.      That crypto-forward institutional investors would flock to NYDIG should be no surprise to those familiar with the space. NYDIG was spun out of $10 billion Stone Ridge Asset Management in 2017 with a mission to court institutional cryptocurrency newcomers. It quickly hired BitLicense architect Benjamin Lawsky and secured $50 million in funding to build out the team.      See also: Fund Manager Got NY BitLicense 11 Months After Hiring Its Architect      NYDIG raised an additional $50 million in growth equity in October. It now offers custody, execution, investment and prime brokerage services to hedge funds, pensions, banks and other high-dollar clients.      The two funds continue NYDIG's recent trend of registering its crypto offerings as Rule 506(c) investment vehicles.

Speaking to former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney at the Council on Foreign Relations on Tuesday, Fink said the nascent cryptocurrency asset class can possibly ""evolve"" into a global market asset, CNBC said.
