Ng’s appointment as Gemini’s Asia managing director makes the firm eligible to apply for a license with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) under Singapore’s 2019 Payment Services Act. According to the act, a qualifying requirement for a license application is that at least one of the firm’s directors should be Singaporean or a permanent resident of Singapore, where Ng resides.      Previously the Asia CEO of Leonteq, a firm specializing in structured financial products, Ng has worked in the financial services sector in Hong Kong and Singapore for about 20 years. In an emailed statement to Coindesk, Gemini said that Ng would report directly to Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss.      “We look forward to building a presence in this major Fintech hub and the Asia Pacific region with Jeremy leading the way,"" Winklevoss said in the statement.      See also: Gemini First US Exchange to Integrate With Samsung’s Blockchain Wallet      According to Gemini’s press release, Ng’s appointment is part of the firm’s continued global expansion plan.

42383955,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zSg9,1591913561,"Free Transactions Invite Systemic Attacks on Blockchains, Researchers Find","The problem with paying gas to run transactions is that it discourages lots of transactions. The advantage of paying gas to run transactions, though, is that it discourages lots of transactions.      This contradiction is captured well in a new paper examining transactions on EOS, Tezos and XRP Ledger (XRPL) over a seven-month period ending in April. Researchers from Imperial College London and University College London found the overwhelming number of transactions on these three networks either have no value attached or are passing it back and forth within one entity.      Titled ""Revisiting Transactional Statistics of High-scalability Blockchain,"" by Daniel Perez, Jiahua Xu and Benjamin Livshits, the report explains these findings in detail.      ""Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of the transactions are used for value transfer purposes,"" the authors write. ""In particular, 96% of the transactions on EOSIO were triggered by the airdrop of a currently valueless token; on Tezos, 76% of throughput was used for maintaining consensus; and over 94% of transactions on XRPL carried no economic value.""      Read more: A Mysterious Airdrop Called EIDOS Is Clogging EOS to Make a Point      The authors' latest version came out Wednesday, following up on two prior versions, with this one including several more months of data. It immediately sparked discussion, with its findings that high-throughput blockchains don't necessarily have a lot of payment activity.      It also illuminated the fact that transparency doesn't necessarily equal legibility.      So many records can pile up on a blockchain that needed information can become needles in a very large haystack. As Perez, a Ph.D. candidate at Imperial College London told CoinDesk in an email, ""When the level of spam activity is very high, the size of the history gets disproportionately large given the amount of useful activity on the network. This makes such blockchains much more difficult to analyze and reason about.""      That said, the authors' analysis is based on a careful examination of each blockchain, looking at the kinds of transactions and characterizing what kind of work they represented. Then they looked at the biggest users of the networks, which generally corresponded to most of the usage, and dug deeper into what was going on in their transactions.      As the authors note, there has been a dearth of academic investigation into blockchains besides that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This analysis of EOS, XRP Ledger and Tezos covers the period from October 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, using data collected by the open source tool, Blockchain Analyzer. Here's what they found for each chain.    EOS    Last November, CoinDesk reported on a mysterious airdrop on EOS that gave users an incentive to make as many low-value transactions as they could, called EIDOS, which overall made the blockchain more expensive to use, making it look very much like a denial of service (DoS) attack (also evidenced by the fact that ""DOS"" is part of the airdrop's name).      The researchers found that most of the transactions taking place on EOS, at least through the end of April, were related to the EIDOS stunt.      The authors write, ""Before the arrival of the EIDOS token, approximately 50% of these are transactions to betting games. ... The launch of EIDOS increased the total number of transactions more than tenfold, resulting in 96% of the transactions being used for token transfers.""      To recap: The EIDOS smart contract sends a token to any EOS wallet address that sends it any amount of EOS. The smart contract instantly returns any EOS sent along with the token. The smart contract rewards transactions, not value, so it doesn't matter how much EOS gets sent. It sends the same number of tokens back no matter what.      EIDOS was worth a little less than $0.02 when we last reported it on it. It currently trades for about $0.0008, according to CoinGecko.      Read more: Tron Dapps Saw $1.6 Billion in Volume in Q1 2019, Driven By Gambling      Additionally, the authors also found that most of the transactions on one of EOS's large apps, WhaleEx, look suspicious. The WhaleEx website says it is the ""#1 Decentralized Exchange in the World,"" yet the authors looked at its transactions and found:    ""Firstly, and most obviously, we notice that in more than 75% of the trades, the buyer and the seller are the same. This means that no asset is transferred at the end of the action. Furthermore, the transaction fees for both the buyer and the seller are 0, which means that such a transaction is achieving absolutely nothing else than artificially increasing the service statistics, i.e. wash-trading.""    WhaleEx could not be immediately reached for comment.      Block.One, the creators of the EOSIO software that runs EOS among a few other blockchains, declined to comment directly to CoinDesk. Instead, they directed CoinDesk to a new Medium post by CTO Dan Larimer, which does not directly address the questions about EIDOS and WhaleEx, but instead dwells on how the report's authors define throughput.      The paper makes a theoretical argument that the true throughput on each of these chains is very low in terms of transactions with actual value, a point which Larimer disputes. In other words, Larimer emphasizes what EOSIO software could be used for. Potential aside, the researchers' findings are about what it is currently used for.      Larimer writes:    ""How the media chooses to report on this paper will reveal whether or not they have integrity to differentiate technological capability and recognize EOSIO as being the most demonstrably scalable.""    Again, Block.One declined to further comment.    XRP    XRP is periodically beset by spam. The authors write:      ""The ledger experienced two waves of abnormally high traffic in the form of Payment transactions in late 2019, the first between the end of October and the beginning of November, the second – at a higher level – between the end of November and the beginning of December.""      Why such traffic occurs, however, is unclear. ""It remains something of a mystery how such an expensive form of 'spam' benefited its originators.""      Ripple's CTO David Schwartz addressed this point when a prior draft of this paper was under discussion. He wrote in May:    ""If you have a cheap, high-capacity public blockchain that was designed for maximum censorship resistance, it's going to get a lot of spam. There's no real disincentive and no authority to stop you. What are you willing to give up to stop it given that it doesn't do much harm?""    That said, they also found that most XRP holders do very little. ""The distribution of the number of transactions per account is highly skewed. Over one third (71 thousand) of the accounts have transacted only once during the entire observation period, whereas the 35 most active accounts are responsible for half of the total traffic,"" they wrote, though such Pareto distributions are not unusual, especially when money is concerned.      Ripple has not yet provided further comment to CoinDesk on this latest draft.    Tezos    On Tezos, the authors find that most activity on the network is related to governance and staking.      They write, ""Tezos has a high number of 'endorsements,' which are used as part of the consensus protocol, and only a small fraction of the throughput are actual transactions."" Further, a large portion of the transactions appear to be bakers (the validators) making payments to users who have delegated XTZ.""      Later, the paper notes:    ""Tezos has not yet come close to maximizing its actual capacity.""    It does not, however, find suspicious or malicious transactions in any real volume on Tezos. TQuorum, an entity that promotes Tezos, had not yet provided comment as of press time.    In conclusion    As most people who follow cryptocurrency know, the Bitcoin blockchain debuted what's come to be known as the internet of value. The paper's analysis then is based on how frequently users actually transfer value, as opposed to making other kinds of transactions.      It raises questions about whether it is wise to design a blockchain so that valueless transactions are free or nearly free. The authors write:    ""While on XRPL the consequences of such a spam attack are limited, on EOSIO they forced the network to enter congestion mode, causing regular users to be unable to use the network because transactions which used to be free started to cost a fee.""    In short, the authors write, ""The massive potential of those blockchains has thus far not been fully realized for their intended purposes.""

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,258 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping 6.4% over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Thursday (8:00 p.m. Wednesday ET), bitcoin was changing hands around $9,890 on exchanges like Coinbase. By 06:00 (2 a.m. ET), its price began to decline, dipping to as low as $9,049. The price is now well below the 50-day and 10-day moving averages, a bearish technical indicator.      Read More: Bitcoin Stuck Below $10K as Stocks Drop      Traders are being confronted with a sea of red across almost all assets Thursday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech on the economy didn’t inspire any optimism about the next few quarters. “The virus and the forceful measures taken to control its spread have induced a sharp decline in economic activity and a surge in job losses,” Powell said in remarks Wednesday.      “You can't print your way out of this,” said Zachary Reece, managing partner of digital asset firm Lotus Investment Strategies Global. “I fear we are taking the opposite approach and will see the downfall of the United States dollar.”      Read More: Fed Sees No Inflation Through 2021, but Bitcoiners Are Betting on It Anyway      Indeed, the U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% off its three-month lows Thursday after Powell’s comments. That could signal investors are starting to look at classic safe havens like gold.      “I think the general negative sentiment of traditional markets affects bitcoin,’ said Sasha Goldberg, a senior trader for Efficient Frontier Markets, a digital asset quant fund. “We’re now seeing the following events priced in the market - riots in the U.S., the China-U.S. trade war, coronavirus uncertainty - among other events that happened lately.”      Bitcoin has increased its correlation to gold in 2020, particularly after March’s crash. The 90-day coefficient is close to 0.35, up from 0 back in January. A coefficient of 1.0 means two assets move in perfect tandem while a coefficient of -1.0 means they move in opposite directions. A coefficient of 0.0 implies that returns on the two assets have no relationship.      Gold is one asset trading flat, down by less than a percent at around $1,727 for the day. “In my view gold is the safe haven for old-school investors and bitcoin for more modern-thinking ones,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter cryptocurrency trader.      Cryptocurrency stakeholders have long insisted bitcoin is its own asset class, not tied to any other. However, it seems like it is increasingly operating with the traditional markets, at least for now.    Other markets    Bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency taking a hit.

42383957,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zSif,1591902943,"With Token Uptick and Israeli Election Work, It's Been a Busy Year for Bancor's Founders","Coinbase announced Wednesday it is considering listing Bancor’s BNT token, as well as 18 others, which already gave the asset’s global trading price a slight bump.      “Coinbase’s goal is to offer support for all assets that meet our technical standards and which comply with applicable laws,” the announcement said. “As part of the exploratory process customers may see public-facing APIs and other signs that we are conducting engineering work to potentially support these assets.”      Although Coinbase declined to comment further, it’s not hard to imagine why BNT made the list. The token project itself saw a resurgence in May, facilitating nearly $10 million worth of trading volume and rising from roughly $0.20 a token at the start of the month to $0.85 by the end.      Bancor’s growth, despite the broader economic crisis in 2020, may be due to a systems upgrade in April. But market analyst Andrew Kang said some of the transactions associated with the surge were related to a wallet affiliated with Bancor CTO Yudi Levi. According to the Bancor analytics site Blockchair, BNT in particular was used in more than 10,457 transactions on Friday, May 29, out of 2.67 million transactions total since 2017.      When asked about the surge, Bancor spokesperson Nate Hindman said the Bancor team practically invented automated market makers (AMMs), which he said are now organically popular.      “After introducing AMMs in 2017 and having seen their meteoric rise in the last two years, we are thrilled to solve some of the key obstacles to their widespread adoption and continue to drive innovation in this key area of decentralized finance [DeFi],” Hindman said of the upgrade in April. “AMMs are now used in a wide range of DeFi products and protocols.”      The network analytics site Dune Analytics estimates the decentralized exchange (DEX) software and token have been used to process more than $1.4 billion worth of transactions to date.      BNT’s growth comes as other DEX tokens have surged in recent months. Kyber Network (KNC) surged promptly after being listed by Coinbase in February 2020 and became one of this year’s hottest crypto assets. Ethereum-friendly DEX tokens like KNC and BNT appear to be increasingly lucrative in 2020.      Yet, even after the jump, BNT tokens are now selling for far less than they were during the initial sale in 2017. The overall DEX system, however, is only growing in value as the Bancor team garners political clout in addition to their considerable token holdings. As such, some blogs continue to promote the idea that BNT is “undervalued.”    Data experts    It’s proving to be an eventful year for the Bancor team even beyond the token activity.      On March 2, 2020, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Bancor co-founders Eyal Hertzog and Guy Benartzi, along with their business partner, LiquidApps CEO Beni Hakak, for their “help” using “data” to win the March election. Hertzog and Benartzi were among roughly two dozen campaign leaders mentioned in both the victory speech and featured in the official photo of the celebration in Netanyahu’s office.      Stepping back, the token founders – who declined to comment on the election – raised more than $153 million in 2017 for the DEX project now serving hundreds of people a day. Still, it's unclear if the crypto companies, Bancor and LiquidApps, had anything to do with this software system during the Israeli election.      Most likely, the token founders were acting as private citizens rather than corporate donors or contractors. Either way, Israeli professor Anat Ben Dov said the Netanyahu campaign’s data strategy “was turning citizens into informants” by using both Facebook and a mobile app called Elector. This strategy encouraged voters to enter sensitive information about all Israeli citizens, Ben Dov said.      “The more people you added to the app, the higher your rank was. You could get stars, like military ranks,” Ben Dov said of the app’s gamified leaderboard. “The campaign was said to transport data from Facebook to Elector … it’s also a social supervision system.”    Outsized role    Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, said that“data was the game changer in March 2020” because Netanyahu used Facebook data to push “proactive” notifications to influence voters.      “Using personal data to win an election is not unique to Israel, it’s also happening all around the world,” Altshuler said. “This is similar to what was done in America in 2016.”      Ben Dov agreed, adding this “wouldn’t be possible because of the GDPR,” but it “might be possible in the United States.”      Indeed,Netanyahu leaned heavily on American advisers for this data strategy, including President Donald Trump’s campaign strategist John McLaughlin. Netanyahu also relied on another American consultant, former Breitbart journalist Aaron Klein. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon credited Klein with the idea of interviewing former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s sexual assault accusers ahead of an October 2016 presidential debate. Altshuler said Netanyahu and Trump have similar, and complementary, digital media strategies.      “On the surface, you have leaders trying to be as extreme as they can,” Altshuler said. “The deeper layer is using personal data to target these messages and spread them through specific social groups.”      On the other hand, both Netanyahu and Trump fans see such strategies as effective leadership in an age of voter apathy and high-tech tools.      Regardless of the Bancor founders’ political activism, their proximity to such data strategies may offer a competitive advantage. Understanding how to compliantly encourage specific behaviors, whether it’s voting or trading, is part of the digital casino game. Plus, Coinbase appears to be ramping up DeFi governance features in 2020.      Update (June 12, 16:40 UTC): A passage in an earlier version of this article mis-paraphrased a tweet by market analyst Andrew Kang.

42383945,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zSUp,1591901337,"Quadriga Was a Ponzi Scheme, Ontario Securities Regulator Says","QuadrigaCX operated like a Ponzi scheme.      That's the key finding of an Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) report made public Thursday.      OSC, one of Canada's provincial securities regulators, said the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange, which went into bankruptcy a few months after founder and CEO Gerald Cotten was reported to have died in India, ""was an old-fashioned fraud wrapped in modern technology.""      The report, dated April 2020 but released publicly on Thursday, took aim at Cotten's practices, including allegations that he traded against his own customers, set up fake accounts on other exchanges to trade using his customers' funds and failed to maintain records. These allegations have been made in the past by Ernst and Young (EY), a court-appointed auditor tasked with recovering customer funds following the exchange's February 2019 collapse.      The company has recovered about C$46 million to date.      “In 2016 he became the only person in control of these assets,” the report said, adding:    ""The evidence shows that Cotten regularly moved clients’ crypto assets off the Quadriga platform and into accounts he had opened on other crypto asset trading platforms. At one point, Cotten told a Quadriga contractor that a certain wallet address was a Quadriga cold storage address, when it was really a deposit address for Cotten’s account at another crypto asset trading platform.""    While it has been speculated that the missing customer funds – close to $200 million – were lost because Cotten was the only individual to control his exchange's crypto wallets, OSC said in its report that in reality, Cotten lost the funds through ""fraudulent conduct."" The regulator totaled this at about C$169 million.      ""The bulk of the asset shortfall – approximately $115 million – arose from Cotten's fraudulent trading on the Quadriga platform. Cotten opened Quadriga accounts under aliases and credited himself with fictitious currency and crypto asset balances which he traded with unsuspecting Quadriga clients. He sustained real losses when the price of crypto assets changed, thereby creating a shortfall in assets to satisfy client withdrawals,"" the report said.      The OSC put the report together by interviewing former Quadriga contractors, advisers, clients and his widow, Jennifer Robertson. Quadriga co-founder Michael Patryn did not respond to a request for comment, though OSC said a majority of the lost funds were deposited after Patryn's departure from the exchange in 2016.      Robertson declined to comment on the report.      ""What happened with Quadriga was an extreme example, and not necessarily representative of the broader crypto asset trading platform industry. However, these events serve to highlight for investors the risks that can arise in relation to crypto asset trading platforms, particularly those that are not registered,"" the report said in its conclusion.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/11/quadriga-was-a-ponzi-scheme-ontario-securities-regulator-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36c08d81c5898441aed0b7020732d72950cbf32c-1180x907.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This includes a discussion on how FedAccounts and other digital tools might help the federal government distribute stimulus payments to help Americans suffering the economic fallout of COVID-19. The virtual hearing kicks off at noon Eastern (16:00 UTC), which you can watch here. Separately, ING Group, crypto custodian Copper, smart contract platform Cypherium and Giesecke+Devrient Currency Technology GmbH have joined the Digital Monetary Institute (DMI), which seeks to research the adoption of digital currencies by central banks.      Decentralized Storage Arweave, a blockchain network meant for the permanent storage of data, has released a completely new approach to smart contracts to run on users’ computers rather than the blockchain itself. The SmartWeave update will dispense with gas fees and only requires a smart contract’s code to be run as often as it’s needed and not by every node on the network. Meanwhile, Unstoppable Domains released an uncensorable decentralized blog (dBlog) service hosted on Protocol Lab’s InterPlanetary File System. Finally, Filecoin announced the launch of the ‘Incentivized Testnet’, the final phase of testing for its decentralized storage network.      Custody Battles Crypto custodians are in a race to build the next State Street or BNY Mellon. Recent acquisitions in the crypto space have seen a bundling together of services such as custody, settlement, lending and trade execution – including examples by BitGo, Genesis Trading and a recent partnership between Galaxy Digital and Bakkt. This pace of consolidation is likely to continue, and firms specializing in standalone custody or trade execution may need to pivot to offer additional services or risk being swallowed up, think BitGo CEO Mike Belshe.      Politics Patrick Nelson (D-NY) is running for New York State Senate, with a background in local politics, progressive activism and vocal support for cryptographic monies. CoinDesk spoke with Nelson about his previous attempts to fundraise using bitcoin, reforming the state’s burdensome BitLicense and his attempts to convince party leadership to use blockchain voting to elect the state’s delegates.      Privacy The Human Rights Foundation (HRF) will support bitcoin privacy tech with its Bitcoin Developer Fund. The first $50,000 grant has been awarded to a CoinSwap developer, and HRF will continue to support those “working on strengthening Bitcoin pseudonymity at the network level,” Chief Strategy Officer Alex Gladstein said. Elsewhere, Catallaxy, a blockchain consultancy affiliated with accounting giant Grant Thornton, is teaming up with CipherTrace to better track cybercrimes.      Financial Products Crypto exchange BTSE will price its new tether gold futures contracts in bitcoin. The perpetual contract tracks the value of one tether gold (XAUT) token, which itself tracks the value of gold, allowing traders to speculate on whether bitcoin or gold will turn out to have the most demand. Elsewhere, crypto retirement savings firm Bitcoin IRA will take on smaller accounts with the launch and redesign of its IRA products. The firm has dropped the standard account minimum to $3,000, and launched Saver IRA. Separately, crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital now holds 6.26% of GBTC shares, worth nearly $259 million. (The Block) Lastly, Coinbase is looking to possibly add 19 new digital assets, including Aragon, Aave, Bancor, Siacoin, Origin Protocol, Ren and VeChain. The news is drive prices up between 8-25%.

(Decrypt)      Human Interest Smart drugs, a class of performance-enhancing supplements are seeing widespread use in the tech and crypto sectors, and prompting much skepticism everywhere else. “Being in frontier tech means you’re (a) more exposed to new ideas and tools, (b) in a community where experimentation is normalized and widely and openly discussed and often encouraged, and (c) more willing to try new things,” Meltem Demirors, CEO of CoinShares, said.    Market intel    Inflationary Boost? There’s no end in sight to loose monetary policy at the Federal Reserve, and that’s just fine with bitcoin bulls. Fed officials said Wednesday they expect to keep interest rates close to zero through 2022, while pumping at least $120 billion a month of freshly created money into the financial system for the foreseeable future. While the monetary guardians are not expecting runaway inflation, cryptocurrency analysts said that the longer the central bank sticks to its loose-money stance, the higher the chances of inflation down the road. Prices for bitcoin, seen by many investors as a hedge against inflation, rose on the news.      Stuck for Now Bitcoin remains stuck below $10,000 amid jitters in traditional markets over the pace of economic recovery. While bitcoin’s price is down 1% on the day, the major equity market indices in Europe are reporting over a 2% drop. The futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Wall Street’s equity index, are down over 600 points and reporting a 1.8% decline on the day.

42383947,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zSZr,1591893305,Bitmain’s Power Struggle Takes Toll on Customers as Co-Founder Halts Shipments,"Its employees have been forced to choose sides but now Bitmain's customers are also in the middle of the escalating power struggle at the world’s largest bitcoin miner manufacturer.      Chinese crypto media BlockBeats reported on Wednesday that since his return in early June, once-exiled co-founder Micree Zhan has halted a Shenzhen subsidiary of the Beijing-based Bitmain from shipping bitcoin miners to its clients.      A China-based mining customer of Bitmain and a Bitmain staffer close to the matter confirmed to CoinDesk the temporary delivery halt at Bitmain’s Shenzhen warehouse.      According to its 2018 initial public offering prospectus, Beijing Bitmain owns a subsidiary called Shenzhen Century Cloud Core Technology, which is responsible for manufacturing and packaging its bitcoin miners at a warehouse for delivery and pick-ups. Despite his ouster from the parent company in October, Zhan remains a director at the Shenzhen subsidiary.      While it remains to be seen how this internal struggle will affect customers in the long term, some have raised concerns, casting doubts on the business outlook of the bitcoin mining giant.      See also: Internal Struggle at Bitcoin Mining Giant Bitmain Escalates to Physical Confrontation      Igor Runets, CEO of BitRiver, the largest mining co-location site in Russia, said many of his clients have switched to Bitmain’s main rival MicroBT with little lead time.      “But we have many clients who are waiting for [AntMiner] S19 devices from Bitmain,” he said. “Customers were not satisfied with the long wait time and this I believe was partly caused by internal issues [at Bitmain].”      “We really hope the situation will get to normal by September and won’t affect production time. Otherwise there will be a massive erosion of trust to the company,” Runets added.      Matt D’Souza, co-founder and CEO of Blockware Solutions, a U.S.-based miner distributor that also owns mining facilities, said his firm became aware of the shipment issue weeks ago, which caused him to pause orders from Bitmain for the time being. Apart from self-mining, the firm also offers hosting services for clients and has regular demand for mining equipment in thousands of units, D’Souza said.      “[The] counterparty risk is out there but we have significant demand,” he said. “It makes you fear being long Bitmain (buying coupons on the secondary, buying machines that ship several months away) etc.”    Choose a side    After being ousted by his rival co-founder Wu Jihan last October, Zhan regained status as the legal representative in China of Beijing Bitmain in early May, which caused some physical confrontation. But his return to Bitmain’s Beijing office earlier this month has fractured the company.      In China, a company's legal representative has broad powers to act on a firm’s behalf. A legal representative usually holds the company’s official seal, a crucial element for signing a company’s decision into effect.      The Bitmain staffer also said customers who have wired payments to a Bitmain subsidiary called Chongqing Guiyuan could see the shipment of their orders being halted.      Chongqing Guiyuan is a new entity registered in March, whose legal representative is Ge Yuesheng, the CEO of Bitmain’s financial services spin-off Matrixport, who sides with Wu. It is fully owned by Bitmaintech Pte, which is incorporated in Singapore and fully controlled by BitMain Technologies Holding.      On April 28, Beijing Bitmain notified customers it had changed the payment recipient account for ordering miners on its official website from Fujian Zhanhua to Chongqing Guiyuan because the Fujian sales center has been involved in a legal proceeding against Zhan.      Soon after Zhan regained his legal representative status in early May he signed off on a document to fire Bitmain’s CFO, Liu Luyao, who was also present at the physical confrontation against Zhan.      At that time, that document didn’t have the company’s official seal and Wu’s side was still in control of Bitmain’s main official communication channels.      But on Wednesday, Bitmain’s official WeChat account published a notice, saying the firm now has a new effective official seal and the old one is void.      See also: Bitmain’s Feuding Co-Founders Are Fracturing the Firm and Staff Are Caught in the Middle      That notice suggests Zhan may have taken the administrative access to Bitmain’s official WeChat account since he is in possession of the new company seal while Wu’s side has the old seal.      In a response, Bitmain’s official website published a notice on Thursday morning China time saying there have been irregular log-ins to the firm’s WeChat channel since Thursday and that the posts made since then are all fake.      Then, on Thursday afternoon, the official WeChat account published yet another notice with the new seal, ordering all Bitmain employees to return to the Beijing office to work. Otherwise, they may jeopardize their salaries, it warned.      “The Beijing office will enforce attendance checks for June. All employees at the Beijing office will only receive full salaries if they have checked in in the office for 13 days,” the notice reads.

Launched Thursday, San Francisco blockchain firm Unstoppable Domains has released its decentralized blog (dBlog) service hosted on Protocol Lab’s InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), complete with the .crypto domain.      “No one can take it down,” Unstoppable Domains co-founder Brad Kam said in a phone interview. “We expect over time all sorts of content that is currently controversial or maybe even not permissible in certain parts of the world popping up because the censorship-resistant internet is usable now.”      dBlogs come complete with tools similar to Medium, with functionality such as plain text, images, audio and video, according to the company. Notable crypto investors and enthusiasts such as CoinShares CSO Meltem Demirors, venture investor William Mougayar and Ethereum developer Alex Masmej have launched personal blogs on the network.      Read more: The Domain Startups Building an Uncensorable Internet on Top of Ethereum      In an email, Demirors told CoinDesk her experience watching the Turkish government censor Wikipedia from 2017 until earlier this year and subsequent actions by IPFS to preserve the domain made her “really interested in the application of IPFS in defending civil liberties and freedom of information.”      Masmej, on the other hand, said he is less interested in the censorship-resistant properties of dBlog than having a permanent nook on the internet for his own thoughts. “It’s like writing for the future,” he said in a private message.      Data is stored using 3Box, which leverages the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture of IPFS for secure and decentralized storage.      Kam of Unstoppable Domains noted the recent rise in censorship among tech platforms, not to mention nation-states with less lenient free speech guarantees than the U.S. He pointed to a report from think tank Freedom House that claimed some 2 billion people “experience a partially or fully censored internet.”      “The numbers are pretty alarming and I think the trend is towards more,” Kam said. “As the world digitizes, the stakes become higher.”      dBlog comes on the heels of Unstoppable Domains integration with web browser Opera on its Android product.

42432075,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9NJh,1591876800,BTSE Exchange Offers Futures Contracts Tracking Tether Gold and Priced in Bitcoin,"Bitcoin has has long been feted as a new form of money, a two-finger salute to the establishment, even as a digital equivalent to gold, but it's not often prized for its stability. That could change with the introduction of a new futures contract.      Crypto exchange BTSE has taken the unorthodox decision to price tether gold futures contracts in bitcoin, rather than in the more conventional U.S. dollar.      Here's how it works: It's a perpetual contract – a future without expiry – that tracks the value of one tether gold (XAUT) token, which itself tracks the value of one troy ounce of physical gold. It's also built on the ERC20 token standard, which means it can be pretty much traded on any crypto exchange.      Unlike other contracts, this one is priced in bitcoin. While the USD spot price of XAUT tokens is currently $1,720, according to CoinGecko, BTSE's contracts are trading around the 0.17 BTC mark.      The contract allows traders to compare and speculate on whether bitcoin or gold will turn out to have the most demand and outperform the other, as a new store of value.      ""Imagine it as gold versus bitcoin,"" a BTSE spokesperson said.      See also: BTSE Exchange Taps Into Crypto Demand by Increasing Request-for-Quote Limits      Still, a gold/BTC contract is bound to raise a few eyebrows.      Like regular futures, perpetual contracts have forced liquidations. If the spot price crosses a certain threshold the contract automatically settles, at a loss to the holder. Crypto observers are all too familiar with these and it's not unknown for millions of dollars worth of USD-quoted bitcoin contracts to liquidate in one fell swoop.      Surely, a contract quoted in bitcoin would run the risk of liquidating all the time?      BTSE reckons that's not likely because bitcoin and gold have a positive correlation against the dollar.      ""If the two assets are positively correlated, then the price volatility of this new instrument is, by right, even lower than Gold/USD,"" a spokesperson said. That's because the price of gold and bitcoin will likely fall by an equivalent ratio, so the contract remains, more or less, stable.      Bitcoin has long been dubbed ""digital gold"" without having any sort of relationship with it. That started to change earlier this year when, against the dollar, it developed a correlation to the yellow metal.      In a report in April, Coin Metrics said the correlation between bitcoin and gold ""suddenly increased"" on March 12 – ""Black Thursday."" The market, they argued, might be treating both as safe havens during increases in quantitative easing and monetary inflation.      Revisiting the relationship last week, Coin Metrics said: ""The correlation between gold [and bitcoin] has consistently maintained relatively high levels for several months now, a phenomenon that has not been historically observed.""      See also: Number of Institutions Buying Crypto Futures Doubled in 2020: Fidelity Report      Not everyone agrees. Charles Bovaird, vice president at Quantum Economics, says the relationship between gold and bitcoin over the past 90 days remains very weak, at under 0.35. ""In other words, the correlation has not been high enough to be significant, at least during this particular time frame,"" he said.      But BTSE argues that in a darkening macro backdrop, where central banks are increasingly relied upon to save the day, the market will begin to treat bitcoin more like a store of value.      As it does, so will its correlation to gold improve, making the prospect of forced liquidations for its gold contract priced in bitcoin less likely. In stark comparison, contracts quoted in dollars, which isn't correlated to gold and who's value could change depending on the effects of increased central bank stimulus, might feel the pressure a little more.      If that happens, bitcoin would become more stable than the greenback.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XAUT,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | XAUT,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/11/btse-exchange-offers-futures-contracts-tracking-tether-gold-and-priced-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54f55063fa94b6e222201c9594cd4433c386da51-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432070,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9N7h,1591876729,Bitcoin Stuck Below $10K as Stocks Drop,"Bitcoin remains stuck below $10,000 amid jitters in traditional markets over the pace of economic recovery.      As of 11:45 UTC, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at around $9,780, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      While bitcoin’s price is down 1% on the day, the major equity market indices in Europe are reporting a drop of over 2% drop. The futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Wall Street’s equity index, are down over 600 points and reporting a 1.8% decline on the day. Asian equities also suffered losses early Wednesday, according to data source Investing.      The Federal Reserve’s dour economic outlook seems to have spooked investors, forcing them to shun risk and take shelter in traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, which has hit a one-month high against the dollar.    The Fed, which held interest rates near zero on Wednesday, said borrowing costs would remain low until 2022. “We are strongly committed to using our tools to do whatever we can for as long as it takes,” Powell saidhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-puts-floor-under-bond-180000691.html, adding that the job market may not recover for years.    See also: First Mover: Fed Sees No Inflation Through 2021, but Bitcoiners Are Betting on It Anyway      Powell's comments have damped hopes of a V-shaped economic recovery, with U.S stocks sliding 0.5% soon after. They had been given a boost last Friday by a surprisingly positive nonfarm payrolls report, which showed the economy added over 2 million jobs in May.      Bitcoin is widely perceived as a hedge against the Fed’s inflation-boosting policies, such as near-zero interest rates and massive asset purchases. As such, one may expect it to climb high on the Fed's commitment to hold rates at record lows for a prolonged period.      However, the bullish move may remain elusive in the short run if the stock market sell-off gathers pace. “While the correlation between bitcoin and equities has been slowly drifting apart in recent weeks, a switch to 'risk-off' in global markets could lead to further downside pressure for major cryptocurrencies,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.      Indeed, the cryptocurrency followed the equity markets in March and April, plummetting from $10,000 to $3,867, as global equities cratered on fears of a coronavirus-induced recession, and investors scrambled to accumulate cash, primarily U.S. dollars.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: Is Bitcoin More Like Gold or Equities?      Now with the halving done, a correlation between bitcoin and stocks may begin to strengthen. Especially as increased mainstream participation from institutions and macro traders appears to make the cryptocurrency, somewhat ironically, more sensitive to global factors.      “The 2020 recession officially marks the beginning of bitcoin as a macro asset class. For retail investors and institutional investors, crypto isn’t the only asset class in their portfolio. Therefore, it’s crucial to look at crypto from a portfolio allocation perspective,” Messari analysts noted in their newsletter last month.      But some analysts still expect bitcoin to continue taking up the mantel as a new safe-haven asset. “While bitcoin may meander on its march to $20,000, future shocks may actually hasten the flight from public markets and accelerate bitcoin's rise,” said Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at blockchain investment and trading firm, Kenetic Capital.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/11/bitcoin-stuck-below-10k-as-stocks-drop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f70c3d609c8fe40af84a07bcad0bd0ca1fac4b7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432083,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9NXh,1591874178,"First Mover: Fed Sees No Inflation Through 2021, but Bitcoiners Are Betting on It Anyway","There's no end in sight to loose monetary policy at the Federal Reserve, and that's just fine with bitcoin bulls.      Officials with the U.S. central bank, led by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, said Wednesday the economy is encountering such a drastic toll from the coronavirus that joblessness is expected to remain elevated for at least three years.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      That means Fed officials expect to keep interest rates close to zero through 2022, while pumping at least $120 billion a month of freshly created money into the financial system for the foreseeable future.      The officials said they see little chance of runaway inflation in the near future because the economic downturn has harshly crimped consumer demand and high unemployment is eliminating any upward pressure on wages.      Prices for bitcoin, seen by many investors as a hedge against inflation, rose on the news, as cryptocurrency analysts said the longer the central bank sticks to its loose-money stance, the higher the chances of inflation down the road.      ""We can be quite assured that the printing presses aren't getting any rest tonight, nor any night for quite a while to come,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, told subscribers in an email.      Just this year, the Federal Reserve has already expanded its balance sheet by about $3 trillion to a total of $7.2 trillion.      And Kevin Kelly, co-founder at the analysis firm Delphi Digital, told First Mover in a Telegram message the dismal economic outlook means governments may have to pump in more fiscal stimulus to jumpstart growth. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office forecasts the federal government's budget deficit will hit $3.7 trillion this year, more than double the previous record shortfall of $1.4 trillion in 2009.      ""Such a backdrop is clearly conducive for hedges against currency debasement,"" Kelly said.      Scott Bambacigno, a vice president at crypto exchange software provider AlphaPoint, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey that ""the Fed can print money but they cannot print jobs.""      ""Assets like gold and bitcoin should do well if the economy continues in this direction,” he said.      Bitcoin prices have surged 36% this year, partly on expectations the largest cryptocurrency by market value might serve as a hedge against inflation. Economists including Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University have written that hyperinflation episodes in Zimbabwe, revolutionary France, and elsewhere, have historically occurred when “when the supply of money had no natural constraints.”      So far, inflation has remained muted. Rising unemployment damps wage growth and consumer demand, reducing upward pressure on prices for goods and services.      ""We're not even thinking about thinking about raising rates,"" Powell said Wednesday, in a televised conference.      A summary of economic projections released Wednesday by the Fed show that top officials at the central bank expect U.S. inflation to stay below the 2% target for the next three years.      Prices for personal consumption expenditures are expected to climb just 1% this year, down from a December projection of 1.9%, according to the document. Inflation will average 1.5% next year and 1.7% in 2022, the officials projected.      As reported earlier this week in First Mover, bond traders also see little threat of inflation anytime soon. And data released Wednesday reinforced the reality that, for the moment, inflation is nowhere to be found.      The U.S. Labor Department said Wednesday that another closely followed inflation gauge, the consumer price index, or CPI, climbed just 0.1% over the past 12 months, partly due to this year’s collapse in oil and other energy-related costs.      Excluding food and energy items, the so-called core CPI climbed 1.2% over the past year, less than half the rate of just a few months ago. It was the weakest core inflation readings since 2011, according to Scott Anderson, chief economist at the French bank BNP Paribas’ Bank of the West unit.      “Our forecast is for core consumer price inflation to continue to moderate year-on-year into early 2021 before turning the corner on reviving growth,” he said in an email Wednesday.      But David Hendler, principal with the bank-analysis firm Viola Risk Advisors, says it's just a matter of time.      ""There's huge inflation ahead,"" Hendler said in a phone interview. ""It's only offset because there's so many people not working. As people go back to work, there will be all this money sloshing around.""      Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of the analysis firm Digital Asset Research, says bitcoin's allure as a potential hedge against inflation dovetails with increasing interest in cryptocurrencies among institutional investors.      The money-management giant Fidelity Investments said Tuesday that, in a survey of almost 800 financial advisors, pension funds, family wealth-management offices and other institutional investors, a majority responded that digital assets ""have a place in their investment portfolio.""      And on Wednesday, the bitcoin-futures exchange Bakkt and cryptocurrency trading firm Galaxy Digital said they were collaborating to provide a trading and custody solution for big investors.      If inflation is coming, now might be the time to hedge against it.      ""Predicting the timing of inflation is very difficult,"" Cipolaro said in a phone interview. ""That's still a wild card.""    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,805 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,980 | 24-Hr Low: $9,724      Trend: Bitcoin is flashing red, having failed to overcome key resistance at $10,000 on Wednesday, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve pledge to keep interest rates at record lows through 2022.      Right now, the top cryptocurrency by market value is trading just under $9,800, representing a 1% decline on the day.      Prices rose 1.2% on Wednesday but, again, failed to close above the $10,000 mark.      Over the last five months, the cryptocurrency has faced multiple rejections in the $10,000 to $10,500 range. Analysts are citing the February high of $10,500 as the level bulls need to beat.      Once that level has been crossed, the focus could shift to resistances lined up at $10,950 (the September 2019 high) and $12,325 (the August 2019 high).      Indeed, the relentless slide in the number of bitcoins held on exchanges indicates investors remain confident about the prospects of a continued movement upward.      The macro environment also supports bullish price action. The combination of increased monetary and fiscal stimulus is widely expected to boost inflation and hedging demand for bitcoin.      Just last month, high-profile trader Paul Tudor Jones II said he held 1%-2% of his assets in bitcoin, citing it as a new hedge against inflation.      However, resistance at $10,000 has remained intact for far too long - quick progress will be needed else traders might start to sell.      If that happens, the market could test dip demand with a notable drop to $9,000. If that's breached, the higher low - the next support level - at $8,630, which was only created on May 27, will likely be tested again.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/11/first-mover-fed-sees-no-inflation-through-2021-but-bitcoiners-are-betting-on-it-anyway,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68f40e708d31553049a4d066be6cb8bc03e6f07e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The DMI is run by the Official Monetary and Financial Institution Forum (OMFIF), an independent think tank concerned with central banking, economic policy and public investment. According to Copper, the move marks a major milestone in realizing the custodian's ambitions to bridge the gap between the world of traditional finance and the emerging potential of blockchain and crypto-related technologies.  “We are delighted to be joining OMFIF’s Digital Money Institute. The forum it provides to create open and productive discussions between public and private organisations is already proving crucial to advancing the foundational structures of global finance and we are excited to have the opportunity to support in realizing this endeavour,"" said Dmitry Tokarev CEO at Copper Technologies.  See also: Copper Claims New Tool Removes Credit Risk From Crypto Trading  The DMI is a group comprised of policy makers, technologists and regulators looking to explore the opportunities presented by digital finance and has found support from the Bank of England, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  Copper joins big-name financial institutions including the multinational bank ING Group, decentralized smart contract platform Cypherium and Giesecke+Devrient Currency Technology GmbH to research the adoption of digital currencies by central banks.  “As more and more institutions are beginning to see beyond the 2017 retail-driven image of the space, the real and long-term value of crypto, and blockchain more generally, becomes apparent. OMFIF has the potential to advance this cause, and move the needle on how the entire financial system views crypto,” Torkarev said.

42432078,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9NPh,1591866000,Custody Battle Pits Institutional Boomers Against Crypto Upstarts,"Crypto custodians are in a race to build the next State Street or BNY Mellon.      There are only a handful of these types of large custody banks and most of them have been around for hundreds of years. But crypto is such a striking example of old world meeting new that it offers firms a rare opportunity to break into a market that would simply be impossible under normal circumstances.      “In the traditional world you can’t really build a custodian, it’s not something you can just break into,” said Diogo Monica, co-founder of Anchorage, a Silicon Valley-based custody platform specializing in crypto. “BNY Mellon has been around for 300 years and now, in crypto, we have a chance to actually build a foundational company that is potentially going to last for that long,” added Monica.      It’s an inspirational long view for sure, but how will things evolve over the short term?      Recent acquisitions in the crypto space have seen a bundling together of services such as custody, settlement, lending and trade execution. The latest push along the prime broker route came Wednesday with bitcoin futures platform Bakkt teaming up with Galaxy Digital to combine custodial and trading capabilities.      Read more: Behind ‘Prime Broker’ Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms      If crypto is entering a period of accelerated consolidation and following similar lines to the traditional world, firms specializing in standalone custody or trade execution may need to pivot to offer additional services or risk being swallowed up.      An evolution towards something like traditional finance is definitely how regulated crypto custodian BitGo sees it playing out.      “This space is going to consolidate very quickly around big strong reputable brands, much like what happened with State Street, JPMorgan, BNY Mellon,” said BitGo CEO Mike Belshe.      The recent unveiling of BitGo Prime allows the platform’s customers to trade directly from cold storage (where cryptographic keys are held deep inside BitGo’s offline, insured vaults) across a choice of two exchanges and two large over-the-counter (OTC) desks.      This saves firms the rigmarole of opening and funding accounts at various exchanges and moving assets around, said Belshe, declining to name the venues currently connected to BitGo’s incipient trading offering.      “All four are tier-one, top-ranked, regulated businesses you’d recognize. We will start naming them in due course. The plan is to grow that by the end of the year to more than a dozen,” Belshe said.    ‘White glove’ treatment    Although a one-stop-shop prime broker platform seems to be what many crypto firms now aspire to, it could be about the buzzword rather than a full understanding of the services being provided.      Prime brokerage is more of a financial services function than a tech function, a fact that may be lost on the new breed of crypto pioneers, said Michael Moro, CEO, Genesis Trading, which recently acquired standalone custodian Vo1t. (Disclosure: Genesis is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.)      Read more: Genesis Trading Buys Crypto Custodian Vo1t in Bid to Become Prime Broker      “As well as having a large balance sheet, attention to client services is an essential aspect when it comes to choosing a prime broker platform,” said Moro. “I think everyone wants the white glove, high touch service, which is how prime brokerage works in traditional finance. But that’s very different from a tech software model.”      The latter approach is to try and scale the business through technology as much as possible, rather than hiring customer service representatives or business development staff, Moro said.      “In institutional finance, the ability to pick up the phone and speak to your coverage person is so important,” he said. “Being able to speak to a human being, as opposed to clicking a few buttons on a platform, I think will be a differentiator among what prime broker platforms are around in a year or two.”    OK boomer    It’s tempting to write this off as an overly cautious crypto boomer approach, pandering to traditional legacy systems. But to do so could be a strategic error.      A focus on gently transitioning traditional capital markets over to crypto is gaining traction for London-based Koine, which is offering a post-trade solution for digital assets combining custody, settlement and cash management. Koine’s solution has so far been rubber-stamped by regulators in the U.K. and the United Arab Emirates.      “The path we envisage involves the ability to transition from existing infrastructure, rather than a new model everyone must switch to,” said Phil Mochan, Koine’s co-founder and head of strategy.      Read more: Coinbase Buys Tagomi as ‘Foundation’ of Institutional Trading Arm      Building bridges between existing market infrastructure and crypto native exchanges is something Koine is tackling in stages, said Mochan. Bitfinex was the first exchange to publicly announce an integration with Koine, and there are currently 12 other workflow models at different stages depending on the trading venue or OTC desk, he said.      “It’s not going to happen overnight,” said Mochan, framing the technological challenge specifically in terms of old-meets-new. “We find there are operational issues around API work almost everywhere, and that’s because 21-year-olds have built these platforms.”    Table stakes    Over the past couple of years, custody platforms have sought to differentiate themselves by offering new and innovative services such as earning yields on proof-of-stake (PoS) tokens by verifying transactions on a network or participating in governance decisions.      However, Moro of Genesis said that while this might have looked like a product differentiator at one stage, it no longer really counts – since many custodians now offer staking and even exchanges such as Binance have gotten in on the act.      “If you’ll pardon the pun, staking has become like table stakes for holding onto customers' funds,” said Moro. “I think it’s really hard to differentiate yourself because the barrier to mimicking is not that high.”      But not all staking services are the same, just as not all custody is the same, said Monica of Anchorage, which uses a complex blend of hardware security modules (HSMs), threshold signing and multiple signatures to lock down crypto assets.      Read more: Beyond Storage: How Custody Is Evolving to Meet Institutional Needs      “The space is rife with people using manual operations from 10 years ago, where they have to actually go to a vault,” Monica said, adding that cold storage solutions of this type became unworkable under COVID-19 lockdown and social distancing.      On the subject of providing staking services, Monica said: “This stuff is hard to build. It may be table stakes in the sense that nobody wants to store an asset with you unless you can generate yield for it. Nobody wants to drop dividends on the floor in the traditional market so why would that be different in crypto?”      Anchorage’s strategy from day one has been to build everything in-house, said Monica, pointing to the Frankenstein-like assemblage of crypto’s recent crop of aspiring prime brokers.      “This can’t just be bolted on. Everything that touches a cryptographic private key is deserving of the ultimate security and attention,” he said. “The path to prime [brokerage] is not by bolting on different solutions built by different individuals and companies with different backgrounds and philosophies.”    The DeFi difference    An unavoidable consequence of crypto prime brokerage is further centralization in a sector built on the premise of decentralization. While the prime broker model may bring a concentration of risk plus added costs, asking traditional players to try out new variants like DeFi (decentralized finance) is a big ask.      Nevertheless, the fast-growing world of DeFi is attracting lots of attention since it eschews traditional finance rather than simply trying to replicate it. With that, comes alternative approaches to trading, settlement and also custody.      Read more: Crypto Long & Short: The Emergence of Prime Brokers Adds Resilience but Also Risk      “We have exactly the same goals but we always try to be slightly less centralized, as much as we possibly can,” said Alex Batlin, CEO of Trustology, a custody platform backed by ConsenSys and Two Sigma Ventures.      “The question is,” Batlin said, “do you wrap it all up like in the old days into a single prime broker with all the risks associated with that, or do you try achieve the same goals but with the lower prices and lower risk associated with decentralization?”      The DeFi custody hypothesis also does away with cold storage: Trustology uses HSMs for near real-time access to assets that cannot be commingled in omnibus accounts.      While the DeFi space is definitely tech-first, Trustology recognizes self-custody without controls is not fit for business or institutional contexts.      “There’s an emerging white space which we are trying to fill,” said Batlin, “We can sign any ethereum transaction or any DeFi protocol fast and segregated, and apply controls.”      Trustology sees decentralized clearing as a viable alternative option, with custodians acting as settlement agents, trying up with protocols like AirSwap. Brokers are also eyeing the billion or so dollars of liquidity locked up in DeFi, said Batlin.      “Brokers are looking to access liquidity and margin on those protocols; asset managers are looking at it the same,” he said. “There are possibly some really interesting plays around committing funds to staking, to collateralized lending, so you get the ability to do a long while being at yield that’s relatively safe.”      While Trustology is focused on Ethereum, Fidelity-backed KNØX is applying its energy towards Bitcoin.      Read more: In Rare Deal, Crypto Custodian Wins Insurance on Full Value of Client Assets      The Canada-based custodian, which holds insurance from mega-broker Marsh, is “philosophically aligned” with Bitcoin and the technologies being built on top, according to KNØX co-founder and CEO Alex Daskalov.      “We have yet to see a custodian that has a tight integration with the Lightning Network, for example,” Daskalov said, referring to the bitcoin scaling solution built for faster payments. “We would love to be there in lockstep with a lot of the tech riding on Bitcoin and layers above it such as Lightning and Liquid.”    Cooperation and competition    Growth in the traditional trading space is not all about competition, there’s co-operation too, which benefits the whole market. There’s also evidence of this among some crypto custodians and brokers      For example, recently launched prime broker BeQuant, which has its own custody solution, says it is open to working with other custodians in the space, as clients want to spread risk just as they do in traditional finance.      “I think you need those standalone guys,” said Richard Shade, BeQuant’s head of custody. “We are open to working and collaborating with a number of these guys and we are talking to all of them, because we realize our customers may already be using them.”      Read more: Bequant Launches Crypto Prime Brokerage to Compete for Institutional Money      London-based custodian Copper, which raised an $8 million Series A in February, says it is also happy to collaborate, as well as compete.      “We are happy to work with people on financing and with people on clearing,” said Copper founder and CEO Dmitry Tokarev, who added that the recent funding affords the firm a further 18 months of runway.      Copper’s ClearLoop settlement solution differs from something like BitGo’s, which is geared towards everyone having a BitGo account, Tokarev said.      “We have already asked other custodians to join the network because that is the best solution for clients at the end of the day. The more exchanges and custodians that join the network, the more efficient (and secure) the entire trading ecosystem becomes. It’s better for everyone, not just Copper,” Tokarev said.    Custody kumbaya    It’s not all kumbaya around the crypto-custody campfire, however. When it comes to the crypto prime broker race, BitGo likes to take a jab at arch-rival Coinbase.      Last year, when Coinbase acquired the institutional business of crypto wallet and custody provider Xapo, that brought the San Francisco exchange’s assets under custody to over $7 billion. At that time, BitGo publicly courted former Xapo clients, which were said to have expressed concern over the new arrangement.      Read more: Crypto Exchange Coinbase Acquires Xapo’s Institutional Custody Business      Following this train of thought, BitGo’s Belshe said the recent acquisition of Vo1t by Genesis was probably a strategy to take back custody of about $2.7 billion worth of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust assets and bring these under common ownership. (Like Genesis, Grayscale is also a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.)      “Grayscale was with Xapo and was sold over to Coinbase, for a pretty high premium by the way,” said Belshe. “I’m guessing that DCG, the Genesis team and the Grayscale team want to pull that custody back.”      But Michael Moro of Genesis scotched Belshe’s theory.      “As I evaluated Vo1t, that was not a consideration at all,” said Moro. “I'm actually not even privy to the contract that Grayscale and Coinbase have so I don’t know the terms or how long it lasts. My understanding is it’s longer-term so that wouldn’t be a near-term event, regardless.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/11/custody-battle-pits-institutional-boomers-against-crypto-upstarts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4e155260482feb140187f26c9048eeef3738ae3-2000x1392.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432077,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9NLh,1591862400,"With Arweave's 'Lazy' Approach to Smart Contracts, Its Version of Web3 Does More","Arweave, a blockchain network meant for the permanent storage of data, has released a completely new approach to smart contracts.      In short, smart contracts on Arweave, much like must of the code on websites today, will be run by users' computers rather than the blockchain itself. Released Thursday, SmartWeave is an approach to smart contracts that allows the blockchain to dispense with gas fees and only requires a smart contract's code to be run as often as it's needed and not by every node on the network.      ""SmartWeave is a new smart contract language environment built on top of the Arweave network,"" Arweave's Sam Williams told CoinDesk. ""It uses this novel type of evaluation called 'lazy evaluation' to move the computational burden of smart-contract execution from the nodes in the network to the users of the smart contract.""      It's like the bake-at-home pizza versus Pizza Hut. Arweave keeps the data ready, available and accurate (in the freezer); users' machines only need to make sense of that data (bake it) when, and only when, it is needed.      Lazy evaluation verifies the data and, in particular, when each piece of data came into the system.      ""The key thing Arweave is offering you is the ability to say every single thing that came through the system has a time ordering,"" Williams said.      Read more: Arweave 2.0 Gets File Storage Project One Step Closer to Its ‘Library of Alexandria’ Dreams      As Ethereum's perpetual problem with front-running on decentralized exchanges (DEX) illustrates, establishing the order of events reliably is one of the more important pieces of work decentralized systems need to do.      That said, it's not important that each node on a network verify precisely how each digital document renders. Much as each computer that opens a website interprets its HTML and JavaScript locally, Arweave requires users' computers to do the processing of information, not the network itself. This logic makes sense because Arweave is fundamentally built to be a new kind of internet.      ""Arweave as a base protocol is very focused on decentralized, autonomous web services,"" Williams said.      Entering a space similar to that of Blockstack, Arweave offers a kind of internet that users log into directly. Once a wallet has logged into Arweave, it can move around all kinds of apps without needing to log into them individually. Williams expects this will create interesting new experiences that we can only partially imagine now.      Arweave's chief value add is creating a system in which data loaded onto the network can be stored there affordably, forever.    What it can do    Many apps have already been built for Arweave but SmartWeave will open a new level of functionality, both because of what it enables and the language it runs on.      ""If you know JavaScript you can write this immediately,"" Williams said. ""I would expect we see DAOs within a few weeks.""      Williams gave a simple example of a potential DAO. Imagine an Arweave based blogging platform, like Medium, that anyone could use but whose prized front page was controlled by a committee (that's the DAO).      Read more: OpenLaw Launches First ‘Legal DAO’ for Distributed VC Investments      Each committee member would have some kind of governance token that allowed them to vote posts to the front page. Whenever each of them opened Arweave and cast their votes for posts, that would get logged as data on the chain.      Each terminal that opened the blog would simply look at the votes and use that to construct the front page that each user sees when they first visit the blog's homepage.      Arweave has a few sample applications ready to go, such as a basic ERC-20-like and non-fungible token (NFT) modules that will be easy for developers to adopt.    High voltage    The limitations really come off of smart contracts when the processing moves off-chain.      ""What that means in practice is the smart contracts can involve exceptionally large amounts of work,"" Williams said. ""That wouldn't really be possible in a normal smart-contract system like Ethereum.""      After that, as developers start to realize further potential for Arweave, Williams expects people will begin to plug machine learning and artificial intelligence into SmartWeave smart contracts. By taking the processing off the network, considerably more powerful kinds of computing can be brought to bear without driving up costs or clogging up the blockchain.      There's another benefit here: safety.      As a plethora of new base layer smart contracts have proliferated, there has also been a bevy of new smart-contract languages built to be safer for everyone to use. Starting with Solidity, there's since been Pact from Kadena, Clarity from Blockstack and Cadence from Dapper Labs, among others.      Read more: Algorand and Blockstack Are Building a Multi-Chain Smart Contract Language      Said Williams:    ""It essentially allows you to run arbitrary code so there doesn't need to be so many safety checks and safety harnesses. Because the problem you have on a normal smart contract system is that I, as a smart contract developer, can get every single node on the network to execute my code, and that means that code absolutely cannot be allowed to be malicious. But with something on SmartWeave you don't need those safety rings.""    The nodes aren't doing all that work. Like on the web, the user needs to trust the code that's going to be executed but the entire blockchain doesn't need to protect itself against every smart contract.      ""I think there will be a later wave that when people start to realize that the additional computational power that SmartWeave allows you access to unlocks a huge number of things you just couldn't have built previously,"" Williams said.",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | AR,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/11/with-arweaves-lazy-approach-to-smart-contracts-its-version-of-web3-does-more,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32b3d418b7bd4e345ce4310b3ae9ed2f7f813a1f-2000x1334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a press statement emailed to CoinDesk, the firm said the launch precedes its expected main network launch this summer. Developed by Protocol Labs, Filecoin’s storage network aims to provide a safeguard against the risk of a single point of failure for data storage by using a decentralized network. Filecoin was also behind one of the major ICOs in 2017 when it raised more than $257 million.      According to the firm, the top 100 miners globally as well as the top 50 miners in each continent are promised filecoin tokens, depending on how much storage they contribute and the overall size the storage network is able to achieve. Beyond growing its network, the incentive is designed to determine how robust its infrastructure really is.      “The incentive competition will stress test the Filecoin protocol’s ability to onboard massive amounts of storage in a very short timeframe,” said Ian Darrow, head of operations at Filecoin, in an emailed statement.      Read More: Filecoin Is Mailing Out Hard Drives of Climate Data to Kick-Start Its File-Storage Network      Regarding security concerns that may arise around storing data on a decentralized network, Darrow said that although the network was targeted towards distributing publicly accessible data, such as image or video sharing, users who wish to store data privately could encrypt it prior to storing it on the network.      “When it comes to consumer adoption, we expect this data security layer to be handled by application developers building on top of Filecoin,” added Darrow.      According to a recent blog post on its website, Filecoin is expected to launch its main network between July 20 and August 21. The firm expects the final phase of testing to last about three weeks, and expects that it would help prepare the network to store large amounts of user data.

Sylo co-founder and business manager Dorian Johannink said the digital wallet can typically store, send and receive cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ERC20-compatible tokens like its own SYLO listed on Hong Kong exchange KuCoin.      “But for the Coke scenario, it’s just supported for bitcoin initially for the trial run, but we may extend the functionality,” Johannink said.      Buying a Coke with bitcoin sounds catchy, but the cryptocurrency has notoriously limited scalability, processing an average of 1 megabyte worth of transactions every 10 minutes, after which bitcoin miners prioritize transactions with higher fees.      But Sylo’s main focus is not on bitcoin as a payment form, but on the vision of connecting crypto to the real world and using the architecture of this trial to roll out digital assets as payment tools more broadly. Centrapay announced the partnership on Twitter Monday, echoing Sylo in claiming it was the “first step toward mainstream digital transactions.” The future, as Sylo envisions it, will allow customers to purchase a digital asset in the real world, perhaps a Coke token, and use it to purchase products.      Sylo has moved quickly in the last few months, going from adding bitcoin to its wallet back in March and listing its token on KuCoin, to a real-world trial run in crypto transactions. According to Centrapay CEO Jerome Faury, the initiative has already demonstrated it can work in Australia and New Zealand, and will be “targeting the U.S. market next with some world-first innovations.”      Johannink said Faury has already established connections in the United States and there are plans to move things quickly, but the regional partnership is still in its nascent stages.      Sylo is determined.      “Let’s see how this initial run goes,” Johannink said. “People are testing it out now. If it goes smoothly, we can roll it out pretty quickly.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/11/coca-cola-distributor-offers-bitcoin-payment-options-for-aussie-vending-machines,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66652f4039f15c81cf12a073a8c02ca3c0f755e0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
