According to data from CoinMarketCap, the XRP competitor is up by 17.61%, outperforming every other top 100 cryptocurrency in the past seven days. Related Reading: Stellar Tough Spot: Will XLM Prices See A Dip Amid Mid-Range Struggles? XLM To Reach $1? With XLM currently hovering around the $0.13 price zone, there are speculations on the next movement. Interestingly, a crypto analyst with the name EGRAG CRYPTO on X (formerly Twitter) predicts that XLM could rise to $1 if certain conditions are met. According to the analyst’s post on September 8, this bullish prediction is formed on a potential crossover between two technical indicators, namely the 200-day Moving Average (MA)and the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). To explain, the MA indicator reflects the average price data over a specific period of time, e.g., 200 days. It is constantly updated and can be used to identify trade areas and recognize market trends. On the other hand, The EMA performs a similar function but with a focus on more recent price points. Due to its method of calculation, the EMA reacts to price changes faster than the MA. Based on EGRAG CRYPTO’s prediction, if there is an upward crossover of the 21 EMA and 200 MA on XLM’s weekly chart, there is a possibility the token could experience a 500% price surge in the coming months, surpassing the dollar mark to trade at $1.10. This prediction is mainly based on historical price data, as XLM witnessed a similar massive price gain when this crossover occurred between 2020 and 2021. However, it is worth stating that all predictions are speculations without guarantees and should not be relied on as investment advice. Related Reading: Stellar Breaks Free: Unleashes New Open-Source Disbursement Platform Another Partnership For Stellar? In other news, the Stellar community appears to be expecting a massive positive update in the next few days. On September 2, Stellar Development Foundation shared with its crypto community that “Something cool is dropping in 10 days”. This announcement was well received, with the XLM token rising by 10% in the next 24 hours. Interestingly, some enthusiasts predict Stellar could announce a new partnership in the coming week. The blockchain network has already collaborated with companies such as American remittance firm MoneyGram and Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin. In fact, Stellar announced a minority investment in MoneyGram earlier in August. For now, it remains unknown what this new development could be. However, there is the possibility it could elicit some effect on XLM’s price trajectory. At the time of writing, XLM is trading at $0.132, having gone up by $0.132 in the last day. In tandem, the token’s daily trading volume has gained by 21.33% and is valued at $119.14 million.

17380123,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550652,1694273731,Here’s Why Ethereum Price Barely Moved Following Ark’s ETF Application,"The price of Ethereum seems to be back under the influence of the current market sentiment despite enjoying a relatively positive week. On Wednesday, September 6, Ark Invest filed for the first Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. This ETF application had a tame impact on the price of Ether, with the cryptocurrency only climbing to $1,650 the following day. Moreover, the token has almost fully reversed the minor gains from the significant development. Ethereum Price Registers 0.1% Rise Last Week – Here’s Why Ethereum currently changes hands at about $1,628, according to data from CoinGecko. A negligible 0.1% price increase in the last seven days underscores the struggling market performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency. A spot ETH exchange-traded fund is an investment vehicle that tracks the price of Ethereum on the spot market, allowing investors to buy and sell the crypto asset via a brokerage account. A product of this kind is expected to boost interest and investment in the Ether token. Related Reading: Ethereum Price is Showing Early Signs of Fresh Rally But $1,670 is the Key Nevertheless, the price of ETH has remained relatively unmoved this week despite the optimistic news. A recent report by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock has provided insight into why the news barely impacted the price of Ethereum. ‘Supply & Demand Balance’ According to the data analytics platform, the current supply and demand balance is one of the primary reasons why the ETH price continues to move sideways. “Large holdings are concentrated close to ETH’s current price, consolidating prices in a tight range,” IntoTheBlock said. Source: IntoTheBlock IntoTheBlock data shows that a total of 5.1 million ETH was acquired below the $1,600 mark to create support, while a total of 6.5 million ETH was purchased at a price above this level to establish resistance. The blockchain analytics firm concluded that traders agree to transact within a narrow range with a large concentration of ETH positions. ‘Automated Buying, Discretionary Selling’ Additionally, IntoTheBlock believes that while bullish traders seemed to have bought the news, “discretionary sellers” overtook the narrative not too long after. “A key factor behind the discretionary selling is likely to be FTX’s upcoming liquidation of reportedly $3B in crypto holdings,” the report read. While FTX has yet to disclose when it intends to execute these liquidations, it is likely that recent activity on the exchange’s wallets alarmed the market.

While the value of SOL jumped by more than 5% to trade above $20 immediately after the announcement, the cryptocurrency is back trading beneath $19.5. With the Ethereum and Solana tokens constituting a significant portion of FTX’s holdings, it is likely that the slow market performance of these assets is driven by traders being cautious because of the impending liquidation.

According to a new PEPE price update, this enigmatic figure exchanged a staggering 726 billion PEPE tokens for approximately 345.7 Ethereum (ETH). What’s more, the acquired ETH swiftly found its way to the Coinbase exchange, adding intrigue to an already sensational move. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, PEPE is currently valued at $0.00000078, with a 24-hour slump of 2.8% and a marginal seven-day loss of 0.1%. However, the impact of this whale behavior is sending ripples through the meme coin’s market dynamics. PEPE’s price saw a brief 3.48% rise on September 7th, but it quickly dropped back to $0.0000007857. This likely indicates that a significant PEPE holder sold their 762 billion tokens at a loss.

PEPEUSDT trading at $0.00000078 on the weekend chart: TradingView.com While the PEPE token continues to capture the imagination of traders, its price appears to be tightly ensnared within a converging triangular pattern. A separate report suggests that as long as this pattern remains intact, the coin’s price may persist in moving laterally over the coming days. This predicament leaves traders in a precarious position. For traders with a bearish outlook on PEPE, the recent whale transaction may present an enticing opportunity. Some are considering the possibility of short-selling the coin, anticipating a potential breakdown. If this bearish sentiment takes hold, the report notes that PEPE’s price could tumble by as much as 10%, potentially retesting the psychological support level at $0.0000007. Insights And Speculation Abound The sudden influx of PEPE coins into the market has raised several questions about its potential impact. The cryptocurrency market, known for its unpredictability, continues to offer intrigue and speculation, with events like Alleged Mattfurie’s massive PEPE token exchange sparking intense discussions.

This downward trajectory has formed a falling wedge pattern, a technical indicator characterized by declining peaks and troughs confined within two converging trend lines. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, BNB is currently trading at $214.94, with a 24-hour decline of 0.9% and a modest seven-day gain of 0.6%. On August 31, the BNB price dipped below the critical $220 local support level, signaling the possibility of further bearish movement.

However, amidst the prevailing market uncertainty, BNB’s price has turned sideways, leaving both buyers and sellers in a state of indecision. BNB weekly price action. Source: Coingecko The falling wedge pattern, often referred to as an ending diagonal pattern, can be seen as a potential signal of exhaustion within a prevailing bearish phase, hinting at a potential trend reversal. If the recent breach below $220 fails to sustain, it could open the door for buyers to challenge the overhead resistance. Binance Coin Potential For Turnaround Price analysis suggests that a successful breakout from this falling wedge pattern would signify a bullish turnaround for BNB. This could potentially propel the coin’s price to target levels of $234, and if momentum continues to favor buyers, it may even reach heights of $247 or even $263.

Token Terminal data reveals that, as of September 6, PancakeSwap generated fees totaling $96,237, indicating a substantial increase in user transactions compared to the previous day. In contrast, BNB Chain’s 30-day revenue stood at $931,700 on September 7. PancakeSwap’s revenue during the same period, however, exceeded expectations, reaching $970,800.

Investors who witnessed a major rally between mid-June and mid-August are now grappling with the harsh reality that these gains have been almost entirely wiped out. As we enter the final quarter of the year, Shiba Inu’s price has exhibited a rather lackluster performance. The token has teetered dangerously close to its July/August lows, casting a shadow of doubt over the optimism that once surrounded it. In fact, a recent price analysis indicates that SHIB has given up over 70% of its gains achieved during its summer surge. Related Reading: XLM Surges With 10% Rally – Can The Recovery Hold Its Ground? Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00000762, as reported by CoinGecko. Over the last 24 hours, it has experienced a modest 0.3% decline, while the seven-day chart shows also shows an insignificant loss of 2.8%. These figures underscore the prevailing bearish sentiment that has engulfed the Shiba Inu token since mid-August, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remaining below the crucial 50-neutral level.

Rather than trying to sell their NFTs on the open market – where NFTs are taking a bear market beating – they are rushing to get a better price directly from its trove of ether tokens.  Under the crypto club’s newly enacted rage quit rules, if 20% of Nouns NFTs call for a “fork” they can split from the main group and take their share of the project’s 30,620 ether tokens (worth about $50 million at press time) with them. Each Nouns NFT is worth about 36.5 ETH ($59,600) in book value, giving the current fork a treasury of 7,598 ETH (about $12.4 million).  Nouns are now trading near that level for the first time since last December, their price pushed up by traders looking to make easy money on the arbitrage. Some of them are well-known figures in the cryptomarket’s “risk free value” trading subculture, including the pseudonymous DCFGod, who owns 28 Nouns.  The situation is the latest in a series of ""rage quits"" that are showcasing how decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) deal with factions of investors who lose faith in their vision and demand their money back. Projects whose assets price below their book value are particularly appealing to activist traders that want to unlock those assets’ value  In the case of NounsDAO, the mechanism for unlocking that value is relatively new.

42392613,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8w0Z,1694224172,"DOJ Claims About Sam Bankman-Fried's Laptop Access Are 'Inaccurate', Defense Alleges","Prosecutors are exaggerating the amount of access FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried really has to defense material, his attorneys said in a memo late Friday.  Bankman-Fried continues to lack decent internet access when produced to a cell block at the Southern District of New York courthouse, and has not had anywhere near the amount of air-gapped computer access that the Department of Justice has said he would have, the letter signed by defense attorney Mark Cohen said.  Bankman-Fried's defense team has tried to have him temporarily released or given greater computer access to work on his defense, saying his Sixth Amendment rights were being violated. Prosecutors have maintained that he has had access to defense materials after his bail was revoked last month on public safety grounds.  Earlier this week, the DOJ filed a letter saying Bankman-Fried now had access to multiple hard drives with defense material provided by the defense, an air-gapped laptop every day of the week and an internet-enabled laptop with a new battery provided by defense attorneys.  In response, defense attorneys wrote that the plan does not work in practice, leading to Judge Lewis Kaplan ordering Bankman-Fried's team to describe what, specifically, they found inaccurate.  Friday's letter detailed these issues, saying Bankman-Fried was only able to load a single document due to poor internet speeds after being produced to the courthouse on Wednesday and granted access to an internet-enabled computer.  ""Effectively, Mr. Bankman-Fried had no access to the internet for the entire 5-hour period,"" the letter said. ""... Despite the Government’s efforts, there does not appear to be a way to solve the internet access problem in the cellblock. That means that Mr. Bankman-Fried has no way to review and search documents the discovery database or the AWS database before trial. The defendant cannot prepare for trial with these kinds of limitations.""  Bankman-Fried also doesn't have the full amount of time to use an air-gapped computer that prosecutors promised, Cohen said.  ""Almost an entire month has passed since Mr. Bankman-Fried was remanded and we have lost that time to effectively prepare for trial,"" the letter said. ""We therefore respectfully reiterate our request that the Court order Mr. Bankman-Fried’s temporary release.""
