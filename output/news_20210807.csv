Investors have continued to hoard assets as the volume of bitcoins sent to exchanges to be sold off or traded falls below the accumulation rate. Outflows from exchanges have continued to exceed inflows into exchanges. Signaling accumulation patterns rather than sell patterns. Related Reading | On-Chain Expert Predicts $162K Bitcoin Peak This Cycle Wednesday saw the price of bitcoin dropping below $38,000 to be trading in the $37,000 range. Inflows of 11.3K BTC to exchanges correlated with this drop in price. But then the next two hours following this price dip saw more outflows of bitcoins from exchanges. 19.3K BTC were removed in the next two hours following the price dip.

Exchange Reserve Volumes Continue to Plummet Outflows from exchanges to personal wallets for safekeeping continue to be on the rise. Bitcoin exchange reserve volumes have seen decreasing numbers following the price crash from the all-time high, and the number has continued to go down. More coins leaving the exchanges than coming in shows that there is currently no selling pressure.

42411928,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh5e0,1628362320,NFT Marketplaces: A Beginner’s Guide,"Do you keep hearing about people buying digital cats, NBA moments and profile pics of cartoon apes, but have no idea where they’re getting these Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.  NFTs are unique tokens that represent ownership of something inherently distinct and scarce, whether it be a physical or digital item, such as artwork, a soundtrack, a collectible, an in-game item or real estate. Unlike regular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or fiat money like the U.S dollar, these special types of digital assets cannot be mutually exchanged for one another because each token has a specific value based on its unique traits and attributes.  To get started, you'll have to familiarize yourself with the specialized marketplaces where NFTs are generally listed and traded, which differ from what you may be used to with crypto exchanges.  What are NFT marketplaces?  NFT marketplaces are platforms where NFTs can be stored, displayed, traded and in some cases minted (created). These marketplaces are to NFTs what Amazon or eBay are to goods.  In order to access and use these types of marketplaces, you will want to set up the following:  A crypto wallet: You’ll need to choose a wallet that is compatible with the blockchain network that supports the NFTs you wish to buy (below). For example, if you plan to buy or sell NFTs based on the Ethereum blockchain platform, you will need to use a compatible Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask.  An amount of coins in the wallet: You will need to pre-fund your wallet before buying, listing or minting an NFT. Again, you will need to find out which cryptocurrencies are supported by the marketplace you intend to use.  A user account: You will need to set up an account on the particular marketplace you wish to purchase NFTs from.  It’s worth noting that, for the most part, listing and creating NFTs on a marketplace platform incurs a blockchain network fee. The fee varies depending on which blockchain-based system you decide to use. For example, Ethereum boasts the largest ecosystem of NFT dapps (decentralized applications). But it has the most expensive fees.  NFT blockchain options  Ethereum is by far the most popular system for buying, selling and creating unique, digital items. There is, however, a growing list of competitors that have also entered the market, including the following:  Binance Smart Chain  Flow (by Dapper Labs)  Tron  EOS  Solana  Polkadot  Tezos  Algorand  Cosmos  WAX  Some of these blockchain systems are interoperable. For example, you can buy Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens with Ethereum-based tokens (called ERC-20 tokens, which include USDT, USDC, BNB, DAI, etc).  How do these marketplaces work?  Signing up  Signing up to an NFT marketplace can differ slightly from site to site, but the main steps to follow involve creating an account or connecting a supported digital wallet, or doing both. The button for this is typically located in the top right-hand corner of the NFT marketplace homepage. When connecting your wallet, you will be asked to enter your wallet password to complete the process.  Buying an NFT  NFTs are usually purchased directly for a fixed price or through an auction. In some cases, prospective buyers can submit offers to the owner and attempt to negotiate a better price.  Selling an NFT  Selling unique digital assets can be a more technically complicated process than buying them, particularly if the user is attempting to sell something they have created themselves (artwork, a soundtrack, a tweet, etc.).  You will need to upload the chosen digital asset onto the marketplace and enter a fixed price or opt to sell the NFT via an auction.  Next, the platform will verify the asset. If approved, it will be listed for sale.  When the seller accepts a bid, the marketplace conducts the transfer from buyer to seller.  Minting an NFT  If you want to create an NFT, you may consider starting with Ethereum, because it’s the largest system for these types of assets. You will need to have an Ethereum wallet that supports ERC-721 (Ethereum’s token standard for NFTs), such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet or Coinbase Wallet. Also, you will have to top up your wallet with about $50-$100 worth of ether to cover transaction fees (depending on how congested the network is).  Once you have completed those steps, you will be able to access and use platforms such as OpenSea or Rarible. Most platforms have a “Create” button in the top right corner that will take you to the page where you can begin minting your NFTs.  Read more: Minting Your First NFT: A Beginner’s Guide to Creating NFTs  Types of NFT marketplaces  While there are many types of marketplaces, universal and art-oriented platforms are the most popular ones. There are also niche NFT marketplaces that list specific kinds of non-fungible assets such as in-game items, digital collectible cards and virtual real estate.  Here are some popular universal and digital art-oriented NFT marketplaces currently available:  OpenSea: This is one of the most established universal NFT marketplaces. You can find non-fungible tokens representing ownership of a wide variety of things, including artwork, sports collectibles, virtual worlds, trading cards and domain names.  Rarible: This is an NFT marketplace that allows any member to create their own NFT on one of three blockchains: Ethereum, Tezos and Flow.  SuperRare: Another marketplace focused on digital art is SuperRare, which works with a select handful of leading concept artists and only allows one-of-one NFTs.  Nifty Gateway – Nifty is one of the largest marketplaces for NFTs. Here you can buy artworks from well-known artists, including Beeple (who holds the record for the most expensive NFT sold for $69 million), Steve Aoki and deadmau5.     For niche digital items like virtual world avatars or digital fantasy football cards, while there is an ever-increasing number of platforms emerging in this corner of the market, there are five main platforms where a majority of NFT sales are made:  NBA Top Shot: An NFT marketplace built on Flow where people buy and sell digital collectible cards featuring videos of memorable NBA “moments.”  Axie Infinity: This platform hosts cartoon characters for the Axie Infinity game, where players breed, battle and trade digital pets called Axies. Some people even play it professionally for a living.  Sorare: Here you can buy virtual cards representing football players and use them for Sorare, which is a global fantasy football game.  Decentraland: This platform has its own in-house marketplace where users buy and sell virtual land or in-game items such as wearables.  Valuables: This is a site where users can tokenize tweets and sell them as NFTs.

42376333,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AApd,1628360160,2 Senators Propose Exemptions to Crypto Tax Reporting Required by US Infrastructure Bill,"U.S. Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) on Saturday updated their amendment modifying a crypto tax reporting provision in the Senate's infrastructure bill.      The original amendment, introduced late Thursday, would exclude cryptocurrency miners who are involved in validating transactions on distributed ledgers and companies that are selling private key hardware or software wallets.      An initial updated version would broaden the exemption beyond just proof-of-work validators, but a second revision appears to exempt only proof-of-work and proof-of-stake validators.      The Senate is expected to vote on both this amendment, as well as a directly competing amendment written by Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). The amendment would exempt a broader swath of non-broker entities from the provision.      The current version of the crypto reporting provision in the bill would broaden the definition of a “broker” to any entity in the cryptocurrency industry that facilitates the transfer of digital currencies for another person. Opponents of the provision have said that it would force miners and hardware and software developers to track transactions of individuals who aren't their direct customers.      Jerry Brito, executive director of crypto advocacy think tank Coin Center, noted on Twitter that the amendment didn’t include protocol developers.      Early Saturday, the Senate invoked cloture by a tally of 67-27. That is the first procedural step toward passing the bill. By invoking cloture, the Senate is limiting debate on the measure to 30 hours, thus allowing for a final vote by the chamber later Saturday or on Sunday.      CORRECTION (August 8, 19:05 UTC): An earlier version of this story said U.S. Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) had introduced the amendment.

Once seized, the government has the discretion to dispose or store these assets the way it deems the best. A good amount has been seized by the IRS alone over the years.

42376324,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AAeJ,1628343000,Senate's Infrastructure Bill: What to Expect on Saturday,"The U.S. Senate is poised to vote on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that calls for $550 billion in new spending for rail networks, roads and bridges, water management and a plethora of other projects. Before that, however, it must work through more than a dozen amendments, including two that seek to narrow a cryptocurrency tax reporting provision that would raise about $28 billion over 10 years.      In its present form, the provision would broaden the definition of a ""broker"" to any entity within the cryptocurrency industry that facilitates the transfer of digital currencies for another person. That could include miners, hardware and software developers, and other parties that help facilitate a transaction, but don't participate in the transaction, the Blockchain Association, Coin Center, Coinbase, Ribbit Capital and Square said in a joint statement earlier this week.      ""Second, it makes possible a massive increase in financial surveillance, potentially requiring companies to report information about individuals even if they are not customers,"" the groups added.      The provision was one of a few that held up the introduction of the overall bill last week, and may have contributed to a delay in votes on Thursday, an individual close to the negotiations told CoinDesk.      To narrow the scope of the provision, Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) introduced an amendment that would exempt miners and other types of validators, as well as other entities that don't provide custody and trading services. The Senate is expected to vote on the amendment on Saturday, though negotiations may push the vote to as late as Monday.      However, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), one of the key negotiators of the overall infrastructure package and the lawmaker who inserted the original provision, introduced a competing amendment with Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), the other lead negotiator on the overall bill.      The amendment would specifically exempt proof-of-work validators (i.e. miners) and entities involved in selling hardware or software that allows individuals to control their own private keys. The Senate is also expected to vote on this amendment on Saturday.    Bipartisan conflict    Both amendments have bipartisan support and are sitting in front of a Senate that has 50 Democrats and Republicans apiece.      CoinDesk reached out to every senator who is not a named sponsor to ask if they would vote for either amendment. The majority did not respond by press time.      Spokespeople for Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) told CoinDesk the lawmakers would support the Wyden/Lummis/Toomey amendment.      On the other hand, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) told CoinDesk through a spokesperson that ""crypto assets and trading platforms need to play by the same rules as everyone else."" He did not address non-trading businesses or explicitly say if he would vote for either amendment.      President Biden has also thrown his support behind the Warner/Portman/Sinema amendment.      ""We believe that the alternative amendment put forward by Senators Warner, Portman and Sinema strikes the right balance and makes an important step forward in promoting tax compliance,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday.      The bill will go to the House if the Senate passes it, where there is also bipartisan opposition to the crypto provision. Reps. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) have all expressed support for either the Wyden/Toomey/Lummis amendment specifically, or at least narrowing the language.

""There is no crisis that compels hasty legislation,"" the Tesla CEO and crypto influencer tweeted after Armstrong called the most recent proposed amendment to the contentious tax provision ""disastrous.""  The amendment submitted late Thursday by Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who wrote the original tax provision, and Mark Warner (D-Va.) was meant to water down the provision by excluding proof-of-work mining and entities involved in the selling of hardware or software that gives individuals control of private keys for digital assets. Lawmakers are expected to vote on the $1 trillion infrastructure bill Saturday.  Armstrong has been among the most vocal critics of the tax provision. In a 10-tweet series, his second in two days, he largely directed his ire at the Portman-Warner amendment. ""At the 11th hour, @MarkWarner has proposed an amendment that would decide which foundational technologies are OK and which are not in crypto,"" Armstrong wrote. ""This is disastrous.""  Armstrong urged readers to reject the Portman-Warner amendment and vote for an earlier proposed change by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), which he praised in a Wednesday tweet thread for narrowing the definition of ""intermediaries who have the capacity to report.""  He believes that the bill could threaten the development of crypto in the U.S. and drive innovation in the industry to other countries by saddling miners, validators, smart contracts, open-source developers and others with ""massive reporting obligations.""
