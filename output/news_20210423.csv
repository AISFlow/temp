42434270,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAcXh,1619221796,Turkey Blocks Bank Accounts of a Crypto Exchange Even as It Hunts for the CEO of Another,"Turkish authorities blocked all onshore bank accounts of cryptocurrency exchange platform in the country, the state-run Anadolu news agency said.    The action late Friday came after crypto exchange Vebitcoin announced that it stopped all of its activities citing financial strains, Anadolu said.  The Turkish Financial Crimes Investigation Board has launched an investigation of the exchange and its managers, the state-controlled agency said.  The move against Vebitcoin comes a day after the agency reported police detained 62 people in connection with criminal complaints filed against crypto exchange Thodex.  The Thodex crypto exchange went offline April 18 with its CEO subsequently going missing, fleeing the country according to reports. Users have reportedly filed a complaint alleging hundreds of millions of dollars have been stolen, Anadolu reported.  April has not been a kind month to crypto in Turkey. Even before the actions against Thodex and now Vebitcoin, the Turkish central bank announced on the 16th that cryptocurrency is to be banned as a means of payment.  The ban is being enacted at a time when crypto use was soaring as the Turkish lira has faced significant outside selling pressure.  The currency plunged in foreign exchange markets following President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s firing of the nation’s top central banker Naci Agbal in March.

42389630,6HUmrVESdCCDHrrhgaSW5H,1619219215,NYSE Files to List Shares of Valkyrie's Bitcoin ETF,"Valkyrie Digital Assets is getting ready to launch its bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) filed a 19B-4 Form on behalf of the investment firm for its bitcoin ETF late on Friday. The form kicked off a 45-day review period when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledges the filing. During that time, the SEC has to either approve or disapprove the application, or extend the review period.  “This is something that I’ve wanted to do for five years now,” said Steven McClurg, chief investment officer of Valkyrie Investments. “It wasn’t until recently that I believed that the SEC would probably approve a bitcoin ETF. So we started working on that in earnest probably in August.”  The SEC has rejected every bitcoin ETF application, but Gary Gensler, the SEC's new chairman, could change the regulator’s attitude to the novel investment product. Gensler is a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman who taught crypto and blockchain courses at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  In January, Dalia Blass, the director of the SEC’s division of investment management, left the agency. In 2018, Blass wrote a letter expressing concerns that the bitcoin market wasn't large enough or liquid enough to be ready for an exchange-traded product.  Several firms have applied for a bitcoin ETF in anticipation of the new administration. Earlier in March, Valkyrie proposed an ETF that would invest the majority of its capital into companies that have bitcoin on their balance sheets or are otherwise connected to crypto, and it filed a registration proposal called Valkyrie Bitcoin Trust in January.  Valkyrie is the at least the fourth firm to file a 19B-4, following VanEck, which filed one in March and had its 19B-4 acknowledged by the SEC on March 18. The SEC is also reviewing WisdomTree and Kryptoin’s ETF applications.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/23/nyse-files-to-list-shares-of-valkyries-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01e4f8b8a9613ff360c98032e1dae3140eeb8c80-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434289,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAd7h,1619209941,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Steadies After $300B Market Cap Dump on Taxation Trepidation,"The value of the cryptocurrency market declined by hundreds of billions of dollars Friday but seems to be recovering at the close of the business week.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $50,993 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 3.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $47,875-$52,557 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour but below 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin fell over the past 24 hours, with the asset dipping as low as $47,875 around 09:00 GMT (4 a.m. ET) according to CoinDesk 20 data. The price is now retrenching from the loss, at around $50,993 as of press time.      Analysts pointed to U.S. President Joe Biden’s proposal to double capital gains taxes on high-income individuals as the catalyst.      “My take right now is that the Joe Biden tax has something to do with it. Sellers probably jammed the market, and bids disappeared,” said Consantine Kogan, partner at investment firm Wave Financial. “U.S. participants are just a portion of the market but probably the wealthiest, both corporate and retail.”      “Bitcoin broke the $50,000 support, going back to early March price levels with a drawdown of 25%,” noted Elie Le Rest, partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. “Holding ground at $50,000 would confirm the accumulation pattern by institutional investors at or below $50,000, leaving room to grow for bitcoin in the coming weeks and months.”      Bitcoin had been in the doldrums for most of the week while alternative cryptocurrencies shined as recently as Thursday. But no asset was completely spared during the recent fall.      Total crypto market capitalization, as provided by charting software TradingView, fell from $2 trillion to as low as $1.7 trillion, a $300 billion plunge that exemplifies the fickle nature of blockchain-based assets. As of press time, total cryptocurrency market cap is recovering but still down 1.7% over the past 24 hours.      As usual, liquidations, the crypto market equivalent of a margin call on Wall Street, exacerbated the price drop. According to data aggregator Bybt, over $3.4 billion in long liquidations occurred across all cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours.      The tumble began late Thursday in the U.S. equities markets, with the S&P 500 falling 0.80% Thursday. Not long after the U.S. market closed, bitcoin began its slide below $50,000.      Darius Sit, partner at quantitative trading firm QCP Capital, noted that larger macro events, such as the fear of higher taxes on traders and investors, cause most markets to work in tandem. “When there is a deleveraging event, everything is correlated,” he told CoinDesk.      Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of investment firm Tellurian Capital, highlighted $50,000 per BTC as a key market price point as taxes might still stay front and center in market dynamics over the next month or so.      “We are still seeing good BTC support at $50,000,” Bonnefous told CoinDesk via a Telegram message. “However, [it is] important to mention also as an exogenous factor the possibility of selling as the tax deadline is nearing in May ... always entertaining for sure.”      Read More: Bitcoin Drops Below 100-Day MA as Selling Picks Up on Biden’s Tax Plans    Ether volumes way up in 2021    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Friday, trading around $2,370 and falling 6.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      After making double-digit gains while bitcoin was in the dumps this week, ether has fallen with with the rest of crypto and was doing worse than bitcoin Friday in terms of 24-hour price performance.      “ETH usually dumps more,"" said Stefan Coolican, chief financial officer of investment firm Ether Capital. “Whereas yesterday ETH was the outlier in terms of its strength, today is a more normal sight.”      This year has seen more liquidity than ever flow into the ether market, and it seems to have occurred around the start of the year, according to data from CoinDesk Research. In 2020, average daily ether volume across exchanges was $12 billion. For 2021 so far, that figure has jumped to $36 billion in ETH volume per day. More liquidity means more traders buying and selling ether, meaning its price could easily rebound in bullish conditions, compared with previous years.      That bullishness could come back. Ether Capital’s Coolican termed Friday’s bearish-leaning market as temporary after a crazy run-up so far this year.      “Generally, the crypto markets have been really robust for the past few months and it's not unusual to see some weakness after big runs,” he said.      Ether prices are still more than triple where they started the year.

42434284,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAcvh,1619209916,South Korea's Top Financial Regulator Suggests All Crypto Exchanges Could Be Shut Down,"The head of South Korea’s financial regulatory agency has created controversy by saying all the country’s cryptocurrency exchanges could be shut down in September.      During a meeting of the National Assembly’s policy committee on April 22, Eun Sung-soo, chair of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), said the agency has yet to receive any any Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) applications required under a recently amended law going into effect later this year.      “There are an estimated 200 cryptocurrency exchanges in the country,” he added. “But if the current situation continues then all of them could be shut down.”      Eun was referring to South Korea’s anti-money laundering (AML) law, the Financial Transactions Reporting Act (FTRA), which was amended last year to apply to crypto exchanges. The legislation requires VASPs to register with financial authorities.      The FSC began accepting applications for registration on March 25, but no exchanges have applied yet. Exchanges have until Sept. 24 to have their registration approved by the FSC. The FSC will only approve exchanges that can sufficiently demonstrate the robustness of their AML systems.      On April 19, the government’s policy office issued a statement that authorities will implement a “special enforcement period” from April to September to shut down any “illegitimate crypto businesses” and ensure that exchanges are abiding by the FTRA.      The most important qualification for VASP registration is an official partnership with a local commercial bank. Out of the some 200 exchanges to which Eun alluded, only the country’s four largest exchanges, known as the “Big 4,” have established such partnerships thus far. Many industry insiders already think the Big 4 will end up being the only exchanges to survive the regulatory tidal wave, but Eun’s comments have stirred up new worries.    Read more: S. Korea’s Crypto Rules Might Only Help the ‘Big 4’ Exchanges    Eun’s remarks come at a time when interest in crypto among Koreans is booming. The Big 4 registered 2.49 million new users during the first quarter of 2021, 64% of them in their 20s and 30s. Traders in their 30s devoted over $398 million on crypto trading, outspending every other demographic. Shutting down the Big 4 would deal a severe blow to these young investors.      When asked about normalizing crypto trading, Eun’s response was, “The worry is that officializing the cryptocurrency industry and bringing it in under regulatory approval will only encourage speculation.”      Regarding legal protections for crypto traders against scams, Eun said that “it’s difficult for the state to protect crypto traders,” claiming that crypto trading is inherently more speculative than stock trading. He compared crypto transactions to fine art deals, explaining the state doesn’t take responsibility for consumers being scammed by art counterfeiters. “It’s the personal responsibility of the buyer to protect himself from [crypto] scams,” he said.      This isn’t the first time South Korea's traders have faced government-induced agita. In January 2018, the country’s justice minister announced during a press conference his ministry was “preparing legislation that effectively prohibits cryptocurrency trading” and that the ministry’s goal was to “shut down all exchanges.” Park went on to equate crypto trading with “gambling.”      The global price of bitcoin plummeted 8% on the day of Park’s comments. Due to the so-called kimchi premium, the local price plunged as much as 15%. South Koreans refer to this day as the “Park Sang-ki disaster.”      On the day of Eun’s comments, the kimchi premium stood at around 13% but fell to as low as 2% the next day. This drop was coupled with a steep decline in bitcoin’s global price.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Felix Im,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/23/south-koreas-top-financial-regulator-suggests-all-crypto-exchanges-could-be-shut-down,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3550f2488d6206f381d23cc5623dda35ef72749-1500x1019.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434281,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAcxh,1619205811,Privacy Coin Firo Re-Launches Lelantus Protocol After February Suspension,"The Firo privacy coin’s Lelantus protocol has been reactivated following a hard fork on April 22. The hard fork took place on block 365544.      The protocol was disabled due to a number of suspicious transactions while the Firo team investigated. This was the second recent obstacle for the protocol, which also underwent a 51% attack earlier this year.      “In February, an unknown attacker utilized Firo’s Lelantus privacy protocol to forge fake proofs in an attempt to generate new coins, which led to abnormalities in the system,” said project steward Reuben Yap in an email. “The Firo team swiftly noticed this and used the emergency switch functionality to temporarily disable Lelantus until the situation could be resolved.”    Read more: Privacy Coin Firo Temporarily Disables Protocol to Investigate ‘Suspicious Transactions’    According to Yap, Lelantus was audited before its deployment on the mainnet. However, while translating the math to code not everything was caught – even in the audited cryptographic library.      Firo has since incorporated a variety of optimizations to harden the protocol.    How the attack occurred    In this case, the attacker forged a spend, but in order to make the transaction seem legit the person “time traveled” back a bit to set up the necessary events. Specifically, the attacker started constructing the first proof. Halfway through, the person stopped and made a different proof.      Upon completing the second proof, the attacker went back and edited the first proof, doing the necessary back-calculation to ensure the math would check out (balancing the serial numbers to fool the verifier) and both proofs would work together.      When executed properly, this sort of double-spend attack allows the nefarious actor to “duplicate” funds.      “If the audience sees you shuffle the deck first, it’s easier to think you did something wild and magical,” said Dr. Aaron Feickert, a former Monero Research Lab researcher, describing the attack. “This attack is like being allowed to examine the deck and order it in front of the audience. The trick doesn’t seem so magical anymore.”      Earlier this month, Feickert joined the Firo team under a full-time contract through Cypher Stack, a blockchain consultancy and digital utilities provider. In this role, he has helped Firo analyze the suspicious activity attack and implement fixes alongside Firo’s Aram Jivanyan, Levon Petrosyan, Peter Shugalev and PinkPanther. He also recommended several of the optimizations Firo added, helped harden the protocol and provided design feedback for Lelantus version 2.    Read more: Privacy Coin Firo in Midst of ‘Hash War’ With 51% Attacker    The Lelantus protocol was originally launched in mid-January. It introduced “on-by-default” privacy and prompts users to anonymize their funds with the goal of ensuring transactions sent by official Firo wallets stay private. Transparent transactions have to be explicitly selected. It also allows for partial redemptions of its native FIRO coin through its burn-and-redeem model.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | XMR | RESEARCH | FORKS,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/23/privacy-coin-firo-re-launches-lelantus-protocol-after-february-suspension,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45342eb44a2719219fb878243a8bb1a4fe330643-2560x1582.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434275,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAcfh,1619202294,Chiliz's CHZ Holders Love the Nasty Elbows – And the 20-Fold Price Gains in 2021,"Friday night’s mixed martial arts bout between British featherweight fighter Brendan Loughnane and Brazil’s Sheymon Moraes could make history – and not because of the expert footwork or the nasty elbows.      It’s because the entire MMA fight was made possible through the wizardry of fast-emerging blockchain technology and one particular platform in particular: Socios, a unit of the company Chiliz, where sports fans can use the increasingly popular genre of cryptocurrencies known as “fan tokens” to express their devotion.      Some lucky crypto traders have made a fortune betting on Chiliz’s in-house token, CHZ, which has surged 20-fold this year in digital-asset markets, to a previously unthinkable $2.3 billion market capitalization. That compares with a 70% year-to-date gain for bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, and a tripling in the price of No. 2 ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain.      In the case of Friday night’s Professional Fighters League (PFL) fight, the matchup was chosen by fans who purchased PFL-related tokens via Socios; they voted on whom they wanted to see square off in the EPSN+ event. The PFL fan tokens sold out in under 10 minutes for $500,000 during the initial launch.      “This is what really got me excited,” Katie Talati, head of research for the cryptocurrency-focused asset-management firm Arca Funds, told CoinDesk in an interview, adding:    “I know we work in this space all day. But at the end of the day, we’re really a tiny subset of the overall population. And I think if we want to bring the benefits of tokenization and digital assets in the blockchain to the wider community, we need to offer more of this kind of consumer-facing applications that interact with our everyday lives.”    When it comes to cryptocurrencies, of course, there’s no way to avoid the notorious price volatility. On Friday, the CHZ tokens appeared to get swept up in a broad sell-off across cryptocurrency markets. As of press time, the Chiliz coin price was down 21% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.      Whether the tokens are a good investment might come down to just how fast the platform grows.      Malta-based Chiliz burned about $800,000 worth of Chiliz tokens Thursday after an impressive first-quarter earnings report, thanks to its business model of combining sports and crypto, two communities with some of the most committed adherents anywhere. The token burn means there’s now less supply in circulation, and so theoretically the remaining tokens should be worth more.      The Chiliz token’s price increase year-to-date makes it one of the top performers among all cryptocurrencies with at least $1 billion market capitalization, according to Messari data, in a league with the astonishing performance of the meme token dogecoin (DOGE) and the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap’s CAKE token.    Read more: PancakeSwap Widens Binance Smart Chain’s Lead Over Ethereum on Transactions    Sports and crypto have already proved to be a powerful combination, with NBA Top Shot and its FLOW tokens recently becoming one of the hottest platforms for recently buzzy non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, in the form of digital trading cards linked to fans’ favorite NBA players’ video highlights.      There are two major platforms under the company Chiliz: the Chiliz exchange, which facilitates trading fan tokens, and the Socios.com sports fan engagement platform, where sports fans can interact with their favorite sports team through fan tokens – both run on the Proof-of-Authority Chiliz blockchain.      “Since last year, the digital-assets market has really started to recognize different sectors and different themes, and have used those kinds of themes for investments,” Talati said. “Chiliz is just a very standalone project. There’s nothing else that’s in the sports realm that’s trying to use tokenization to incentivize fans in that same way.”      Chiliz raised $65 million in 2018 through a private token sale to investors including Binance, OK Blockchain Capital and FBG Capital. Earlier this year, it received an equity investment from Chicago-based trading firm Jump Trading. The company also recently launched a partnership with the European affiliate of Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten, allowing Rakuten’s users in Europe to redeem their Rakuten points for fan tokens.    When crypto meets sports    Some 25 fan tokens are now offered on Socios after the company secured a series of partnerships with sport teams and leagues including FC Barcelona, Manchester City, Juventus and the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).      “Large organizations like football clubs and the UFC need control of their brands and monetization rights,” Mason Nystrom, an analyst at Messari, wrote in a research analysis last September on Chiliz. “Tokenized loyalty points and rewards present new opportunities for increasing revenue beyond ticket sales. The push to grow digital lines of revenue will surely grow even once the pandemic subsides.”      At the time of writing, the most-traded fan tokens on Chiliz exchange are FC Barcelona Fan Token and Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token, according to CoinMarketCap.      As CoinDesk reported, the initial fan token sale of FC Barcelona ($BAR) last June hit well above $1.3 million with more than 600,000 tokens sold.      The Chiliz project’s governance, according to Talati, also has made the token appealing for sports fans to hold long-term.      ""As a woman, I love Beyonce, you know,"" Talati said. ""I can totally see Beyonce token one day"" given the high fan engagement empowered by the underlying blockchain technology of Chiliz. (In other words, catering to music listeners instead of sports nuts.)    Rising speculative interest in East Asia in Chiliz coin    Excluding the activity on the Chiliz exchange, trading volume in the CHZ token is most active on global crypto exchange giant Binance, Korea-based Upbit and OKEx, according to CoinGecko data, reflecting significant interest from retail speculators in East Asia.      Based on growing interest in cryptocurrency as a whole, as well as the long-standing passion toward professional soccer leagues, Chiliz’s success in the East Asian countries was inevitable, Jason Kim, chief investment officer of the Tokyo-headquartered investment firm Anchor Value, told CoinDesk.      Bitcoin has become too expensive for newly entered crypto investors in South Korea, and the relatively cheap and available Chiliz, especially with its sports theme, makes it a popular crypto investment there, Kim said.      Of course, CHZ tokens are not nearly as cheap as they were a few months ago.",POSITIVE,CHZ,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | CHZ | TOKEN SALE,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/23/chilizs-chz-holders-love-the-nasty-elbows-and-the-20-fold-price-gains-in-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/13a0deab75d94ef045e992ee4fbc377fd17c1ece-1300x865.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434287,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAd1h,1619201631,A Bridge Called Tether,"Once upon a time, there was a bridge strung between two mountaintops. It was made of rope and wooden boards and creaked and wobbled in the wind, but every day the mountain people used it to cross the yawning chasm. They called it Tether.      “It could snap any time!” cawed the crows that regularly circled above their heads. While the people dismissed these shrill creatures as a nuisance, deep down many of them harbored a tinge of doubt. Yet, they continued to cross the bridge back and forth, often several times a day.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    It was the most convenient way to get from one peak to the other. Alternatively, they could hike down one mountain, cross the Valley of the Banks and climb the other, but that would take days. Crossing the bridge took an hour at most. It was not simply a matter of impatience; the people made their living by trading with their neighbors on the other mountain, and by the time they had completed the journey through the valley a trade opportunity might be gone.      Besides, nobody lived on the bridge. It was only used to travel from point A to point B. If lives were at risk, as the annoying birds kept warning, it was only for brief periods of time. The bridge had been there for years. It might not be there forever, but who was to say it would collapse on a given day?      See also: JP Koning – Tether’s Report Card Offers Less Detail Than Rivals’      Over time, new bridges between the mountains were constructed parallel to the Tether bridge. These bridges were, by all appearances, far sturdier, made of steel and vouched for by the most respected engineers in the land. Meanwhile, the keepers of the Tether bridge struggled to find an engineer willing to even inspect it (until one day one came from a beautiful island far, far away).      Some of the mountain traders started crossing these new spans, known as USDC, GUSD and PAX. But the majority of them kept using Tether.      It turned out the proprietors of the new bridges stopped travelers at the edges, made them sign a journey book and searched all their pockets. “It is the law of the land,” the bridge keepers would say. “We cannot allow our bridges to be used by thieves or riffraff.” Occasionally, the bridge keepers would throw someone off their bridges mid-crossing, explaining they were ordered by the king of the valley.      By contrast, the keepers of the Tether bridge historically gave their patrons just a cursory pat-down at entry and exit (though they did get stricter over time and threw at least* one suspected thief into the abyss). For most of the mountain people, the nerve-racking experience of crossing the old bridge was preferable to the indignities required to use the new ones.      One day, an old mountain man who had managed to strike it rich in the valley constructed another, most unusual span. This one was perpendicular to the USDC and Tether bridges, connecting them.      See also: JP Koning – Regulation Could Actually Help Tether      Some of the mountain people took this as a sign the crows had been wrong all along. The man, after all, was respected among the engineers who inspected bridges, and the king had allowed him to amass his fortune. So if he was willing to have anything to do with Tether, maybe it was here to stay.      Even the white-knuckled travelers felt a bit relieved.

42434288,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAd3h,1619200507,Dogecoin and the New Meaning of Money,"In an ugly week for markets, it’s striking the crypto news that caught even more attention in the mainstream media was not bitcoin’s whopping 24% drop from its peak early Saturday morning, but dogecoin’s spectacular rally earlier in the week. This week’s column dives into why that phenomenon, while literally built on a joke concept, is not something to be laughed at. The surprising clout of the DOGE mob speaks volumes about how power is being redrawn in the digital age.      And for this week’s podcast episode, we deliberately turn a blind eye to the number-go-up (and down) obsessions of the crypto market and talk about what really matters: human dignity. Sheila Warren and I talk to Human Rights Foundation Chief Strategy Officer Alex Gladstein and a Sudanese activist who uses the pseudonym Mo and the handle @SudanHODL for his podcast to talk about what bitcoin, as a “global neutral money,” can do for human rights.      Have a listen after reading the newsletter.    The Doge age    A part of me worried I was giving in to temptation by writing this column.      There’s an understandable concern within the CoinDesk newsroom that covering dogecoin could signal that we favor easy clicks from fanatics over the risk of encouraging bubble-fueled investments in a coin with no inherent technical advantages.      But then I read Max Read’s excellent piece on the future of money from last week, which inspired a delightful New York Magazine cover that asked the question, “Can I SPAC my Stonks With NFTs?” I now realize – hear me out – there’s no more important story about the reimagination of money right now than $DOGE’s crazy price surge. (See the chart in the next section.)    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Dogecoin mania, as exemplified by the cryptocurrency community’s failed quest this week to get its price above 69 cents on Tuesday in honor of a 04/20/69 date meme associated with “national stoner day,” doesn’t just seem frivolous, it is. Yet, there’s real, serious money at stake.      In that sense, dogecoin’s wild ride encapsulates an important moment in human history. Society’s traditional “story” of money is breaking down, where new, head-scratching concepts like SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are flourishing, and where fun and games and mob-buying can overwhelm markets.      Doge is part of an intense competition for meaning within the world of money, a testament to the 21st century power shifts fueled by two separate financial crises and by the rise of social media networks. Let’s explore them.    The story’s end    We start with the idea that money is a story.      Regular readers will know I’m a fan of Yuval Harari, whose bestselling “Sapiens” argued that human civilization is built on our capacity to organize around commonly believed imagined concepts.      Harari’s examples of these constructed ideas included “the corporation” and “the nation-state,” among others that have enabled us to form complex societies. It’s money, though, he says, that’s “the most successful story ever told.”      Currencies do not have a core, intrinsic value. (Sorry, gold bugs, that applies to your favorite shiny metal as much to paper money and cryptocurrencies.) A currency’s value is dependent on shared belief in that value. That’s not to say certain types of money don't have qualities that help its story resonate, which is why bitcoin can be described as “sound money” and dogecoin cannot. But without belief, all money is worthless.      For much of the past two millennia, the dominant story was that money’s value flowed from the sovereign because the state, empowered with taxation, had an overarching interest in optimizing the societal accounting function that is money’s true purpose. Then, more recently, in the era of fiat money it was the “good faith and credit” of the government (rather than a fixed supply of gold) that would guarantee that value. Later, that story was enhanced by the idea politically independent central banks would maintain a currency’s value by managing its supply in society’s best interest.      Now, as we enter into a phase where state-backed money competes with both decentralized cryptographic money such as bitcoin or dogecoin and with corporate money such as diem (formerly libra) or Starbucks points, that narrowly defined story is falling apart. The first catalyst came a little more than a decade ago.    Crisis moment    In his piece, Read traces the current breakdown to an interview then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave to ""60 Minutes” in 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. Asked if the Fed’s monetary injections into troubled banks were funded by taxpayers, Bernanke shook his head and said: “To lend to a bank, we simply use the computer to mark up the size of the account that they have with the Fed.”      He was telling it as it had long been: The Fed creates money by adding to or reducing banks’ reserves. But to the confused masses grappling with financial meltdown it was a revelatory challenge to the foundational story.      It revealed that the creation of money is not bound by some sacred rule of scarcity and is mostly unrelated to the coins and banknotes that stand, in our collective imagination, as its representative units of value. It showed money as a digital accounting system a single entity can adjust through a few clicks on a computer.      Fast forward to March 2020 and a new crisis: COVID-19. Amid a tanking global economy and a desperate scramble for dollars, the Fed took its “quantitative easing” policy into overdrive, declaring it will put as many fresh computer-based dollars as needed onto banks’ balance sheets to stave off financial collapse, with no upper limit on the program. It also expanded the category of assets it accepts in return for those new dollars to include corporate debt, exchange traded funds and other non-government instruments. It now seems the Fed will buy almost anything to prop up markets.      Meanwhile, the “trillions” numbers attached to stimulus efforts in this new era of “QE infinity” are so unfathomably big that, as Bloomberg columnist Jared Dillian noted last spring, “money is losing its meaning.      This erosion of meaning is leading people to question money’s value, which is naturally leading them to buy other things. It is reflected in the surging prices for assets that seem to outsiders to be unhinged from real-world value: in bitcoin, in Gamestop stock, in NFTs and, yes, in dogecoin.      But before we get to Doge, consider another contributing factor: social media.    Leaderless online communities    Social media has challenged the central organizing structure of pre-internet society. Although the internet has failed to address wealth inequality in aggregate, the power for anyone to publish, and to do so pseudonymously, has had a democratizing effect, empowering communities to generate new stories around which to organize.      This is meme culture. Social media enables the crowdsourcing of stories around memes, which in turn generates new forms of belief, a sense of purpose and camaraderie. And with that, these communities can, for once, stand up to the established order.      That’s what we saw in the GameStop phenomenon, where a 7 million-strong Reddit community drove up the price of its favorite game retailer’s stock to impose huge losses on hedge funds that had tried to short-sell it on the view that its value was out of touch with reality.      The dogecoin phenomenon is similar, with a key difference: There is no focal point for a regulator or a powerful Wall Street money manager to exert pressure against. This is a big departure from the GameStop case, where regulators and private equity funds essentially combined forces to stop Robinhood, the WallStreetBets group’s favored trading app, from processing trades in the stock, causing its price to collapse.      With dogecoin, not only is there no one in charge of the cryptocurrency, trading activity is spread across dozens of exchanges, some of which are themselves decentralized.      Who or what would a regulator go after? Dogecoin was created – as a joke, literally – by someone who not only quit the project but the entire crypto movement. Like Bitcoin, there was no premine or initial coin offering creating pre-launch tokens for founders and there is still no identifiable team of leaders able to manipulate dogecoin’s performance to its benefit and at the expense of others.    Marketing meets memes    For now at least, this structure leaves the far-flung, fanatical Doge community to go about its collective business of meme and buzz creation, stirring speculation in the coin.      Equally important, it’s creating unique opportunities for others to hitch their wagon to this quirky, community-powered brand and its prevailing Shina Ibu logo: an image of fun, of absurdist irony and of common interest – a brand fit for the Gen-Z and millennial-led internet age. This is, in turn, giving rise to a new, symbiotic model for marketing as brands look to leverage the Doge community’s high-value engagement.      A defining moment came with Slim Jim’s imaginative Doge-driven social media marketing campaign. But the foundation was laid in the early days of the dogecoin community, recounted recently by CoinDesk’s Ollie Leach, when enthusiasts spontaneously contributed to various marketing campaigns to boost the coin’s prominence. In 2014, there was a dogecoin-sponsored Nascar driver and, in a stroke of genius, the dogecoin-funded Jamaican bobsleigh team.      Dogecoin will never be what bitcoin is or aspires to be: a store of value, a global reserve currency and a future medium of exchange for a decentralized economy. But in this unique convergence of memes, a fun brand, a strong community formation and some powerful marketing clout, we see how the 21st century digital media economy is reconceptualizing money.      This does not mean you should invest in dogecoin. It does mean the Doge phenomenon matters.    Off the charts: Doge and the goliaths    Today’s chart tracks dogecoin’s wild price ride against the performance of some well-established corporate names on Wall Street.      Just two weeks ago, dogecoin’s market cap was $8.3 billion, just below that of Hyatt Hotels. Then it started rising, not only beating out the hotel chain but also surpassing, in quick succession, the valuations of engineering giant Halliburton, banking conglomerate Credit Suisse and insurer Aflac. Then, last weekend, the $DOGE market cap rose above $45 billion to get beyond that of 330-year-old British bank Barclays, before peaking on Monday at $53.98 billion, a hair above Swiss banking giant UBS.      Since then, dogecoin’s valuation has slipped back and was just below $40 billion on Thursday afternoon. That’s on par with asset management giant T. Rowe Price.      Not bad for a joke coin.    The Conversation: Bitcoin Vs Gold    Stansberry Research staged a much-anticipated debate this week between MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who is a prominent bitcoin advocate, and investor Frank Giustra, a fan of gold and a bitcoin skeptic. It got a lot of attention.      Saylor, who crowdsourced his debate prep with the help of a sci-fi themed battle scene, opened with some big statements. He suggested that if a deity were to come down and design the perfect “God coin” system, Bitcoin would come closest to having the same attributes. (For the record, he also provided a detailed description of how Bitcoin works and why he believes it is the highest form of “sound money.”)      The imagery and hyperbole seemed to irk Giustra, who said the use of laser eyes and other crypto-insider jokes made Bitcoin “feel like a cult.” In a follow-up tweet, gold market media outlet Gold Telegraph chose to emphasize that point by superimposing alongside a video of Giustra an image of a laser-eyed Saylor as the Pied Piper, leading a crowd to its demise.      Who won? Predictably, opinions divided along tribal lines, though bitcoiners seemed more confident of Saylor’s victory than gold bugs were of Giustra’s. Here’s podcaster and prominent bitcoin supporter Preston Pysh, whose Twitter feed was full of snippets of the MicoStrategy CEO making “devastating” points against his opponent.      In contrast, outspoken gold investor and bitcoin critic James Rickards declared that “Frank won on substance” in what was the “best ever” gold vs. bitcoin debate.    Relevant Reads: Regulation Rumors    The weeklong bitcoin price rout began last weekend in rather dubious fashion.    As Omkar Godbole reported, bitcoin plunged $8,000 early Sunday to a three-week low of $52,148. This happened after the Twitter account FXHedge, which mostly posts all-cap headlines from mainstream news reports, published a since-removed tweet saying the U.S. Treasury was about to charge financial institutions over crypto-based money laundering.  The veracity of that report was questionable. As Nikhilesh De explained on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover"", it appeared somewhat related to reports Friday that new Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler was awaiting a report from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on the cryptocurrency industry before moving forward with his agency’s own blueprint for the sector. But Nik’s sources gave every impression that the story of an impending crackdown was unfounded.  Maybe the truth wasn’t what mattered. As Kevin Reynolds pointed out in a well-timed opinion piece later that day, the perfect recipe for a crypto sell-off had been prepared: the market had soared and new rookie investors were nervous. So when the FXHedge report combined with a CNBC tweet of a month-old story about Indian banning crypto and erroneous accounts that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong had sold most of this stock (when in fact he’d only sold 1.5%), the market was primed to go lower.  Still, once that downturn had happened, bitcoin was unable to recover and on Thursday underwent another big downturn, this time doing so in sync with wider financial markets, which got whacked by reports the Biden Administration is planning to drastically increase capital gains tax rates. At the time of print, the leading cryptocurrency was poised to clock its worst week since mid-February. And as Brad Keoun reports, it “dominance” ratio had tellingly dropped below 50% of total crypto market cap as ether and other altcoins were relatively less harmed by the declines.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Michael J.

42434271,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAcVh,1619197208,Paxos Becomes Third Federally Regulated Crypto 'Bank',"Stablecoin issuer and blockchain startup Paxos has become the third crypto-native company to score a federal trust charter through the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).      The national bank regulator announced Friday it has granted Paxos a preliminary charter, letting the firm bring its new Paxos National Trust entity online as a federally regulated entity offering custody services, stablecoin management, payment, exchange and other services.      With the approval, Paxos joins Anchorage and Protego in becoming one of the only national trusts that were born in the crypto ecosystem. Kraken and Avanti have also become state-regulated crypto bank entities after securing Special Purpose Depository Institution charters through Wyoming.      The move is another sign that the global cryptocurrency ecosystem is becoming increasingly acceptable to regulators, who have traditionally been wary of the still-young industry. In particular, the preliminary approval indicates that the OCC is comfortable with Paxos as a custodian, which is significant for an industry prone to hacks or exchange crises.      Becoming an OCC-regulated trust is one way crypto exchanges can operate nationwide without needing to secure state-level licenses in each of the 49 different U.S. states (Montana doesn’t have a licensing requirement).      “This is a preliminary conditional approval, which means that the OCC is approving our business plan,” said Paxos General Counsel Dan Burstein. “It’s deeming the activities that we have identified in the business plan to be those that can be carried out by a national trust, that we have the right team in place and the right controls and plan in place to control our risk and to operate as a national trust company.”      Paxos now has a year and a half to execute on its business plan and show the OCC that it can operate safely. At the end of that period, the regulator will evaluate Paxos’ operations and determine whether it will sign off on a final charter, though Burstein said he expects that process to occur well before the 18 months are up.    Dual approach    At the moment, Paxos’ business plan doesn’t stray far from its existing operations, which include its stablecoin-as-a-service offering, exchange and custody products and crypto brokerage services.      Paxos, which filed with the OCC in December, will set up the Paxos National Trust to operate under the OCC charter, while maintaining its New York Department of Financial Services-chartered Paxos Trust Co.      “Our business is not going to change immediately because of this,” Burstein said. “We’re going to continue operating our existing business through our New York trust.”      In other words, Paxos’ new trust has a ""de novo"" charter, meaning it’s starting from scratch, which is a more difficult process than just converting an existing trust, Burstein said.    Read more: Federal Credit Union Regulator Should Look at Crypto Rules, Official Says    In his view, however, the effort is worth it for Paxos’ customers, because they will be able to choose which entity to work with.      The new entity will borrow from Paxos’ existing team as it expands, though.      “Paxos has a tremendous team of engineers and people in our compliance, legal, infosec (information security) and other functions and [we] want to be able to draw from their experience and have the national trust be able to get access to the best possible resources,” Burstein said.      To be clear, Paxos isn’t forming a full bank at this time. It does not have Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) or Federal Reserve approvals, which it would also need in order to form a full bank.      Burstein said Paxos will continue to build out its regulatory stack but the company hasn't determined yet whether it will apply for FDIC insurance or a Fed charter.    OCC charter    In a discussion this week on the Clubhouse audio app, OCC Principal Deputy Chief Counsel Bao Nguyen said the banking regulator has based its approach to crypto companies and trust charters on listening sessions with technology and crypto firms that are seeking ways to offer custody services.      While some companies operate under state trust charters, they may be limited by what those states permit.      The OCC looked at what states such as California, New York, South Dakota and Wyoming did regarding digital assets as it evaluated the trust charter regime, Nguyen said, speaking generally about the regulator’s approach and not about any particular company.      “Our work was largely really identifying that the trust charter, which sort of tees off of state law, permits a firm to provide the kinds of services that I think crypto companies are interested in providing – custodial services, some shared services in terms of handling client assets, in dealing with client trades,” Nguyen said.    Read more: Paxos Trumpets Same-Day Shares Settlement Using Blockchain    That led to an approach focused on leveraging existing law for trust companies, he said.      “We have this charter that doesn't take deposits, that doesn't have to be treated as a bank holding company that could provide all the kinds of services that digital assets companies are interested in providing at the moment,” he said.      Indeed, the OCC's approval notice on Friday highlighted the similarities between Paxos' existing state-chartered entity and the future national entity.      ""Since the bank’s activities will be similar to those of an operating entity, general information as to the business model and operations of the bank is publicly available,"" the approval notice said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/23/paxos-becomes-third-federally-regulated-crypto-bank,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

In the bitcoin crash of March 2020, several crypto lenders, including Celsius, had to make margin calls in the hundreds of millions of dollars.      In Friday’s tweet, the lender said clients should be prepared for margin calls because of “market conditions.”      Crypto lending is popular among holders who want to raise cash without selling their coins and market makers who want to fill orders quickly. The phenomenon could potentially improve liquidity and price discovery for crypto assets but it also has introduced systemic risks.      On Sunday, Nexo, another crypto lender, sent out an email to clients titled ""Safeguarding Your Assets Throughout the Current Market Volatility,"" in which the lender encourages its customers to set up ""adequate notifications for price fluctuations and potential margin calls to avoid liquidation of your assets.""      ""Yes, we issued a few margin calls but nothing dramatic at this stage,"" said Nexo co-founder and managing partner Antoni Trenchev.      Meanwhile, crypto lender Unchained Capital adjusted its loan-to-value maximum down to 40% in February in response to crypto price increases at the beginning of the year. The new LTV is meant to ""help protect clients from margin call scenarios,"" said Unchained Capital CEO Joseph Kelly.      Over at crypto lender BlockFi, CEO Zac Prince noted that BTC, ETH, and LTC loans at his firm max out at LTVs of 50%.      ""I think others may finance coins further down the market cap stack at higher initial LTVs, which may be creating a higher risk environment for their clients now,"" Prince said.      Matthew Ballensweig, lending director at Genesis, a crypto lender that's owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group, said that all of Genesis' clients have fulfilled their margin calls or have paired back loan balances.      ""On the most recent selloff, we’re seeing some trading firms take some profits on the short basis trade and return USD loans until the spread widens out again,"" Ballensweig said.

42434277,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAcjh,1619187557,Millionaire Ex-Banker Who Hates Banks Starts a DeFi Firm in Russia,"Alexander Lebedev is not your usual Russian millionaire.      A KGB officer in the Soviet Union, prominent banker in the post-Soviet Russia and out-of-favor millionaire under President Vladimir Putin, Lebedev is now hitching his wagon to cryptocurrency. A big part of crypto’s appeal is it is supposed to bypass the same banking industry that made Lebedev rich.      “For 20 years, I’ve been investigating fraud in banking,” he said. “And I thought it would be wrong to miss such a chance [to do transactions] without those crooked auditors, banks, lawyers. It’s a great story.”      Lebedev met this CoinDesk reporter in his office with a view of the Moscow skyline and art pieces on every wall. He wore gray sweatpants with white sneakers, sat rocking on a soft bean bag chair and was ready to set off for another meeting as soon as his secretary gave word.      He usually invests in fiat-funded businesses, he said, but today he’s talking about his new crypto enterprise, a “smartbank” taking advantage of decentralized finance (DeFi) named InDeFi.      Lebedev joins the growing ranks of fiat-world capitalists falling in love with the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, including giants like Tesla’s Elon Musk and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, among others, and the Russian oligarch Vladimir Potanin.    From banker to anti-bank    Lebedev was named a billionaire by Forbes back in 2012 (he contests this label). He was owner of the National Reserve Bank and has a colorful political past, having been part of various political parties in Russia. Although a former KGB officer, Lebedev earned a reputation as a liberal tycoon, supporting Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta and the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s charity foundation.      He also owns British newspapers The Independent and The Evening Standard, managed by his son Evgeny, which helped the family into the U.K. elite. However, in 2008, a small Russian newspaper owned by Lebedev published a story saying President Putin had an affair with the Olympic champion gymnast Alina Kabaeva. The article started the tycoon’s downfall in Russia, journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan wrote in their book “The Compatriots: The Brutal and Chaotic History of Russia's Exiles, Émigrés, and Agents Abroad.”    My approach to crypto: We should eliminate banks as a structure. Crypto eliminates this system that is facilitating fraud.    Following police raids on his bank, an assasination attempt and a criminal case for being involved in a fist fight during a TV show, Lebedev ended up selling his banking business and shares in Russia’s leading airline company Aeroflot. His wealth shrunk to $400 million in 2014. He blamed his troubles on running afoul of Russia’s powerful secret service, the FSB, which he criticized for corruption, in an interview with Forbes in 2019.      He also loudly criticized the global financial establishment, calling the industry of offshore tax havens and tax-avoiding practices “the global financial aparteid.”      And this is what brought him to crypto.      Lebedev’s argument is that established financial institutions, in addition to making cross-border transactions excessively onerous, sometimes facilitate fraud instead of preventing it. His belief has been recently validated by the so-called FinCEN files scandal, showing that the world’s most reputable banks helped transfer trillions of dollars for criminal entities.      ""My approach to crypto: We should eliminate banks as a structure,"" he said. ""Crypto eliminates this system that is facilitating fraud.""      In Lebedev’s view, crypto can not only prevent money laundering better than existing anti-money laundering mechanisms that, he believes, don’t work, but it can also be used to more efficiently launder stolen or otherwise hidden funds. This money laundered through crypto would at least re-enter the economy, which would be a net benefit, he said.      “There are a lot of Federal Security Service and police generals [in Russia] who keep billions in cash in their mansions’ cellars,” Lebedev said. “And they will never get caught, so that money would stay out of circulation. So why not let them launder [the] money through crypto and let [it] serve the needs of Russia? I’m getting on a disputable territory here,” he adds.      Andrei Soldatov, the co-author of the book about Lebedev, among others, believes the ex-banker might be expecting to benefit from crypto in two other ways.      “For a while now, Lebedev has been in a tough situation. He’s ambitious but has to operate within very narrow boundaries drawn for him by the Kremlin. Of course, he would be happy to widen those boundaries,” Soldatov said.      Read more: FinCEN Files: BNY Mellon Processed $137M for Entities Linked to OneCoin      Lebedev built his entire career based on being helpful to the Kremlin, Soldatov added, implying the ex-banker could be able to help the government address cryptocurrency issues if needed.      Russia’s authorities have been mildly interested in crypto over the recent years. Last summer, president Putin signed a law regulating issuance and circulation of digital securities, which mentioned cryptocurrency as a type of property. A draft bill regulating taxation of crypto is currently waiting for passage in the national parliament. In the meantime, Russia’s central bank is on its way to pilot a prototype of the national digital currency, the digital ruble.    DeFi game    For now, Lebedev is excited about decentralized finance (DeFi) and wants to marry it with traditional, fiat-based business in his InDeFi startup. A company with an Estonian license but based in Moscow, InDeFi is currently offering deposits in DAI, BUSD and USDT stablecoins.      Clients are rewarded by interest their deposits accrue on platforms like Compound and Venus, although part of it is taken by InDeFi, and also receive the project’s own reward tokens, IDF, which is now traded (but not whitelisted yet) on BSC-based DEX PancakeSwap with a price 2.25 BUSD for one IDF token.      Lebedev says InDeFi has a proprietary method for boosting rewards as an incentive to DAI holders to use his company rather than deposit their funds into Compound directly. The white paper does not reveal any particular profit-boosting mechanics, said Sergei Tikhomirov, postdoctoral researcher studying blockchains at the University of Luxembourg, in providing an overview of the project.      “It’s not clear from the website and white paper how exactly the project can guarantee profit and why it states that ‘negative profit is impossible’,"" Tikhomirov said. “Profit requires risk taking, but it’s not clear what risks are in play here. At the moment, it’s impossible to evaluate the prospects of this project,” he added.      InDeFi CEO Sergey Mendeleev, founder of the Estonia-registered crypto exchange Garantex, told CoinDesk the project uses a set of DeFi tools, including deposits, farming and flash loans, under the umbrella of a single smart contract, which allows it to minimize the number of transactions and trading fees.      The smart contract in question was audited by Pessimistic blockchain audit firm (the audit cites the project named DeFireX, which joined InDeFi and contributed their tech work to it, Mendeleev said).      Among the issues, the auditors said that “the project has no documentation,” so it’s “sometimes unclear for the auditor what is the intention of the code, is its behavior correct, and whether the architecture of the project is appropriate.” More information will be published on the website later, Mendeleev told CoinDesk.      He also said that more products are to be launched, including investing in traditional, brick-and-mortar companies with crypto.      InDeFi was launched in December, and reported raising $3,5 million in DAI from investors including Lebedev and Mendeleev. The money was put on Compound, the interest earned was put into the project development and investors got their investments back, with a bonus of IDF tokens, Mendeleev said. Before the launch, Lebedev pledged to invest up to $15 million of his own funds into the new enterprise.      There is currently no know-your-customer (KYC) process on the website, although the team is now working on implementing that, Mendeleev said. There are also no geographical restrictions so far: Both Lebedev and Mendeleev claim they have no control over the money as funds get “deposited on the blockchain.” However, they admit that private keys for the smart contract depositing DAI are managed by several people involved in the project.      Read also: DeFi Is Transparent, Unless You Look Closely    Back to fiat    Lebedev wants InDeFi to become a vehicle for crypto fundraising, starting with the company he invested in a couple of years ago: a Russian motor-boat building firm called Emperium. Lebedev expects the boat company to go public one day. But in the meantime, he’s ready to play with crypto fundraising.      Investors would be able to put their crypto into Emperium and in exchange would receive the project’s tokens. In the future, the tokens will be exchanged for company’s shares, the announcement said.      Lebedev admits he is dipping his toes into the crypto industry without totally exiting the familiar fiat world.      “I feel more comfortable if my clients’ money would be both on Compound and in some cool fiat project,” he said.      Although crypto has matured quite a bit recently, Lebedev said, he still doesn’t feel completely comfortable in that space:    “I want to take something from crypto, enhance my understanding of crypto and get back into fiat.""

If the U.S. regulator deems the Form 10 filing effective, shares of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund would be registered under the Exchange Act of 1934, meaning it would have to regularly file public updates on its holdings and quarterly reports with the SEC.  That could help woo investors who prefer the clockwork disclosures of public companies like Apple over the tight-lipped mystery of many crypto products. Investors who do buy in can also sell their shares within six months, rather than the 12 months accredited investors must hold shares.  Shares in Bitwise 10 already trade on the over-the-counter market under the ticker BITW. But reporting company status would improve transparency and liquidity for shareholders.  Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund would become the first non-Grayscale-owned crypto product with that distinction and the first reporting company to offer investors broad exposure to coins. (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.)  At the end of March, the Bitwise fund disclosed major positions in bitcoin and ethereum, and sub-100 basis-point stakes in litecoin, chainlink, filecoin, bitcoin cash, stellar lumens, uniswap, aave and cosmos. It has historically traded at a “substantial premium” to those coins, according to a press releasehttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitwise-10-crypto-index-fund-120000784.html.

According to a report by the Yonhap News Agency on Friday, the city's tax collection department discovered cryptocurrencies being held in three crypto exchanges belonging to 1,556 individuals and company heads.      The department has since seized around 25 billion won ($22 million) in digital assets from 676 of the alleged perpetrators.      The 676 individuals reportedly owed the local government 28.4 billion won ($25.4 million) in overdue taxes. Of those 676, 118 of individuals have paid back 1.26 billion won ($1.1 million).      According to a statement from the city, many are asking the city to allow them to pay their taxes rather than sell their seized crypto. ""We believe the taxpayers expect the value of their cryptocurrencies to increase further due to the recent spike in the price of cryptocurrencies and have determined they will gain more from paying their delinquent taxes and having the seizure released,"" the statement said.      The city government will continue to pursue the remaining 890 people in order to reclaim any outstanding taxes being held in cryptocurrencies.      On Monday, the country's Office for Government Policy Coordination announced it will begin cracking down on “illegitimate crypto businesses” as well as all forms of money laundering and scams involving crypto. The move is in line with the recent pursuits by the country's financial regulators targeting illicit activity involving digital assets.

42406253,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAet9zl,1619178905,The Future of Money Is Unbundled,"Money performs three social functions simultaneously. First, it is an asset, a vehicle for storing value, empowering savings. Second, money is currency, a medium to exchange value, enabling consumption. And third, money acts as a unit of account (e.g. credits and debits), a way to keep track.      For as long as anyone can remember, those three roles have been bundled together. The development of crypto markets and financial technology, however, are unbundling those functions, creating new instruments that perform a single role rather than all three simultaneously. In turn, that alleviates trade-offs faced by money-issuers, expanding the possibilities for monetary policy.      To illuminate the unbundling process, let’s look at three recent case studies with key lessons for central bankers who are exploring digital currencies: 1) Bitcoin’s hard fork; 2) China’s DCEP experiments; and 3) the evolution of DeFi on the Ethereum network.    Ben Falk is an Insights Director at EYQ, EY’s global think tank, focusing at the intersection of technology, finance, public policy, and macroeconomy.  Case Study #1 – Money-as-asset: Bagehot’s Dictum Drives a Hard Fork    Bitcoin’s evolution resulting in the 2017 “hard fork” of the network illustrates this unbundling. The term crypto-“currency” is a misnomer applied to Bitcoin, whose architecture and governance make it better suited to store value rather than exchange it. With a fixed token supply, and released in declining quantities on a fixed schedule, Bitcoin creates incentives to hoard tokens. The resulting artificial scarcity makes the token price highly volatile.      Volatility is undesirable in a currency (and unit of account), and as a result, the adoption of Bitcoin as a means of payment has been slow. Scarcity, however, is an attractive feature in an asset and indeed most interest in Bitcoin is speculative with new demand from private investors, including retail, institutional asset managers and hedge funds.    Read more: Money Reimagined: Can Coinbase Live on The Street?    Thus, Bitcoin-as-currency suffered from what technologists call poor product/market fit. The misalignment between the design of the architecture and the targeted application created conflicts among Bitcoin constituencies. Some members of the network sought to increase token supply or to raise the block size limit, making Bitcoin better suited for exchange purposes but at the cost of undermining Bitcoin’s role as an asset. No compromise was reached, and so a breakaway sub-network “hard forked” by duplicating the blockchain to create “Bitcoin Cash.”      Central bankers might recognize the trade-off driving that conflict as the same one surmised in Bagehot’s Dictum. Because money performs multiple functions, issuers trade off satisfying demand for exchanging value with demand for storing value. This feature of money in a simple macroeconomic model generates business cycle fluctuations, as rising uncertainty gives people the incentive to hoard cash.      But where central banks rely on Bagehot’s rule of thumb, the Bitcoin network devised an alternative technical solution by unbundling money’s dual functions. The hard fork created a second, entirely different token targeting the more specific role of money (exchanging value) demanded by a more narrowly defined user base.      That highlights a key lesson technology founders and venture capitalists have known for some time. The design of the token must be aligned to the purpose of the instrument. Product/market fit comes from a deep understanding of user perspectives, and many rely on “design thinking” to drive innovation with that principle in mind.      Further, the experience demonstrates the expanded policy possibilities created by emerging technologies. Freed from the constraints of the physical cash world, central bankers have a wider range of options to pursue their objectives, including, but not limited to, deeply negative interest rates.      Some instruments even target specific liquidity motives; for example Ripple satisfies a preference for international liquidity by relying on a design that sacrifices decentralization to instantly transfer and settle cross-country balancesat scale. Similarly, Z-cash leverages a decentralized architecture alongside zero-knowledge proofs to target a privacy motive. The designmaximizes user privacy without sacrificing market transparency, helping to alleviate the trade-off between the two objectives.      Combining emerging technologies in novel ways may enable the creation of additional new unbundled varieties of more targeted money to better satisfy divergent constituencies with varying demands, possibly alleviating the trade-off Bagehot identified several hundred years ago.    Case Study #2 – Money-as-currency: China Resurrects Gesell Money    No country is as advanced in developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as China is. One of the leading innovators globally, China has been researching “digital yuan” since 2014, and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is committed to deploying a digital currency nationally. It recently completed an experiment in the southern city of Shenzhen of the “Digital Currency Electronic Payment” (DCEP) mechanism, a stablecoin backed 1:1 with fiat Chinese yuan (CNY).      In one of the largest trials of its kind, residents applied to participate in a lottery administered by the Shenzhen local government. Selected participants were issued “red packets” of e-CNY deposits, which could be accessed by opening an e-wallet through the official Digital Renminbi app.      To ensure consumers used the tokens, and in doing so tested the new infrastructure supporting DCEP, the PBoC set special conditions on the trial: The digital currency paid no interest, it could not be transferred to a bank account to be saved, and it couldn't be given to another person. The cash could be spent only at designated retailers for a limited period. Thus, consumers faced strong incentives to spend the money before it expired, as the balances carried an implied negative interest rate. And indeed, spend they did, with about 95% of the money issued ultimately used to buy goods and services during the test.    Read more: Money Reimagined: Crypto as a Payment System? Here We Go Again    The design of the experiment is (perhaps accidentally) very close to proposals from Silvio Gesell, a German entrepreneur whom the late economist John Maynard Keynes called an “unduly neglected prophet.” Gesell argued for a variety of unbundled money that could not be saved, but rather could only be spent (e.g. a medium of exchange, but not a store of value). As an incetive, Gesell suggested money should decay and expire, just as the e-CNY did in the Shenzhen trial.      Gesell's controversial ideas have re-emerged among leading central bankers globally in recent years as they search for new policy tools at, or even below, the zero-bound on interest rates. Emerging innovations are helping to make them a reality again nearly a century after they were first attempted.      China’s proof-of-concept, therefore, demonstrates that high-powered varieties of decaying digital currency are technically feasible, an important international milestone. Innovative varieties of money may give central banks greater firepower to stimulate growth, employment and inflation. The experiment also highlights that hypothesized financial stability risks, such as disruptions to existing payments mechanisms, are manageable, opening the door to further trials globally and rapidly accelerating innovation.    Case Study #3 – Money-as-accounting units: Ether, DeFi and Smart Money    One sector demonstrating rapid innovation is the development of smart contracts and programmable finance, incubated on the decentralized Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts encode in software the terms of a paper contract, which are automatically executed depending on certain conditions.      These automated, programmable credits and debits perform a range of functions, from simple expressions like expiry dates or numerical thresholds, to more complex programs with multiple triggers like those in loan agreements. Innovation taking place in the open and transparent Ethereum community is therefore generating positive knowledge spillovers for policymakers.      A host of new applications are proliferating within this network, broadly under the umbrella term “decentralized finance,” or DeFi. For instance, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where users can trade tokens directly with one another without a trusted intermediary, are seeing user adoption. Lending platforms that encourage loaning and borrowing of digital assets have also grown in popularity.    Read more: Opinion: Five Years In, DeFi Now Defines Ethereum    The application Compound even sets interest rates algorithmically to balance supply and demand for funds, in a fascinating test case for monetary policymakers. Because these programs are open source, they can be used as building blocks and combined to create entirely new applications.      For example, smart contracts could be linked to macroeconomic shocks like recessions, financial events such as bank runs, or policy measures including tax changes to automatically provide liquidity relief to distressed firms and households. Or they might be linked to one another, creating a controlled chain reaction to propagate liquidity injections at specified velocities.      Importantly, because the overall structure is observable and can be known prior to events, smart contracts might provide visibility into how financial instability cascades through the system. Deploying smart money could help central banks achieve their objectives.      This Ethereum ecosystem offers a real-world test of the competitiveness of central bank instruments relative to private digital ones. The good news is that, by an overwhelming margin, Ethereum participants prefer (at the moment) to denominate transactions in U.S. dollars. As soon as private entrepreneurs issued digital tokens backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars, their instruments became the most popular in the network and the primary unit of account in DeFi applications.      The experience demonstrates the importance of ecosystems in stimulating innovation. A core driver of Ethereum’s success so far has been the wide range of developers, engineers, economists, traders, financiers, borrowers and investors who contribute to the platform. Large firms frequently invest in ecosystem strategies to boost the transfer of knowledge from beyond their borders, before incorporating new insights into their business models.      These ecosystem models help organizations stay abreast of the latest ideas, enabling faster experimentation and subsequent deployment of emerging technologies. Central banks should consider building their own fintech ecosystems to encourage innovation, as indeed some already do with regulatory “sandbox” approaches.    Unbundled Money, CBDCs and the Future of Finance    Across crypto platforms, a primary stated motivation is reducing rent-seeking by “middle men” in mainstream financial markets. From the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) scandal, to Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme, to the Panama Papers and associated money laundering and tax evasion, the list of proven, visible, demonstrable rent-seeking behavior in the financial sector continues to grow. The public has obviously taken note. It is that loss of trust that probably represents the greatest threat to monetary sovereignty, not any single technology, community or platform.      Disruption from fintech is now unbundling money, stripping out each role by creating powerful new instruments targeting a more precisely defined user base. New designs might enhance the implementation of monetary policymaking by alleviating fundamental trade-offs. Bitcoin emerged, in part, in response to quantitative easing and perceived inflation risks after central banks sacrificed long-run price stability objectives in order to uphold economic activity and the financial system in the short run. The ability to target highly specific constituencies with distinct user needs indicates the revolution is not so much in money itself, but perhaps rather in monetary policy.      For illustration’s sake, imagine a world in which all savings (e.g. future consumption) is denominated in Bitcoin, and all spending (e.g. current consumption) is denominated in Bitcoin Cash. Such a world is obviously a fantasy, as neither instrument satisfies the diverse needs of their constituencies at large.      But in this imaginary world, one must cross the market to convert savings into spending and vice versa. As such, the exchange rate between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash represents a freely floating interest rate. If such a dual-token strategy was adopted by central banks, state-issued money could be priced rather than fiat.      Will central banks bring such a future forward?

According to data provided by the South Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant, bitcoin's Kimchi premium, a gauge of retail frenzy in South Korea, has declined to 2% from the lofty 20.6% observed on Sunday.  The Kimchi premium is a widely tracked indicator that measures the spread between bitcoin's price on Korean exchanges and other venues.

South Korea announced on Monday a special enforcement period from April to June to target all ""illegal activity involving virtual assets"".  The move comes a month after the Financial Services Commission's (FSC) warned crypto investors to ""check the registration status"" of exchanges and trade with those that have long-term sustainability.  Aside from regulatory developments, bitcoin's 25% drop from record highs above $64,000 reached on April 14 may have taken the wind out of frenzied action on Korean exchanges.

But the effect may be temporary, according to the CEO of a leading crypto-dedicated payment services provider.      Biden’s proposed treatment of capital gains as income, which stipulates a rate of up to 39.6% instead of the current 23.8%, has had ""a shock effect in all markets,"" BCB Group CEO Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie told CoinDesk.

42406269,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetAGU,1619171351,Bitcoin Leads Price Sell-Off Across Crypto Markets as Biden Tax Plan Bites,"Bitcoin slipped on Friday as reports of U.S. President Joe Biden mulling a tax hike on wealthy Americans drew stronger selling pressure in the spot market.      The biggest cryptocurrency traded well below the 100-day simple moving average support of $49,470 during the European hours, marking the first breakdown of the widely tracked technical line in six months and extending the recent sell-off from record highs above $64,000.      Other alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether, binance token, XRP, dogecoin, suffered bigger pullbacks, having outperformed bitcoin in recent days. Dogecoin slipped nearly 25%, while others witnessed 14% to 18% drawdowns against bitcoin's 11% drop.      ""The market has been trading extremely risk on due to Federal Reserve's [liquidity-boosting] policy that supported risk trades. Now the reality of the Biden administration hits, and the market is going to start worrying about taxes & regulations,"" Phillip Gillespie, CEO of the over-the-counter liquidity provider B2C2 Japan, told CoinDesk.      As per The New York Times, President Biden is planning to roughly double the tax on capital gains or proceeds earned from selling assets to 39.6% from 20%. The new rate will be applicable for people earning more than $1 million a year.      The news hit the wires late Thursday and tanked the U.S. equity markets, aggravating the weakness in bitcoin.      ""The cryptocurrency was already on the defensive, having breached the long-held 50-day SMA support earlier this week,"" Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange. ""The tax news invited more profit-taking.""    Spot market sell-off    Bitcoin dropped sharply from $60,000 to $52,148 early Sunday, taking the cryptocurrency below the 50-day SMA for the first time since October. While that move was largely derivatives-driven, the latest drop below $50,000 is likely a result of selling in the spot market.      ""I think ultimately at the core, it's a spot-driven sell-off, with the market having been quite vulnerable to pullback after a parabolic price surge in Q1 2021,"" Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said.      The U.S.-based Coinbase exchange has seen big offers (blue) in the past 24 hours. Bitfinex sellers (green) appear to have played a role as well, according to data provided by Coin Metrics.      Further, exchanges witnessed a net inflow of 20,370 BTC on Wednesday, the highest since March 20, according to data source Glassnode. Investors typically move coins to exchanges when they want to liquidate their holdings.    Market to stay choppy?    Bitcoin might regain some poise over the next few days, having seen a 25% drop since Coinbase's debut on Nasdaq on April 14. However, a solid v-shaped recovery may remain elusive, as per trader and analyst Alex Kruger.      ""Crashes characterized by heavy spot selling don't bounce as hard, making BTFD (buy the f***ing dip) much more challenging,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted early today.      According to Delta Exchange's Pankaj Balani, the market is likely to remain choppy till the end of June, and rallies could be short-lived. ""It's a sell on the rise market for now,"" Balani said, a convincing move above $60,000 would revive the bullish bias.      Renewed whale buying may be needed to revive the animal spirits in the bitcoin market.      Bitcoin's bullish momentum has steadily weakened over the past two months alongside the near 10% drop in the whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 bitcoin      For now, short-term technical studies appear to have rolled over in favor of the bears, and the negative bias would strengthen if prices find acceptance under the 100-day SMA.      ""A deeper pullback is certainly possible. One needs to look no further than a still well extended monthly chart that warns of the risk for additional weakness and consolidation before that next major leg higher,"" LMAX Digital's Joel Kruger said, adding that their focus is on a longer-term upside.      According to Curtis Ting, Kraken's managing director of Europe, the latest 25% pullback is typical of a bull market correction and the broader bias remains constructive. Indeed, bitcoin saw several 20%-30% drawdowns during the 2017 bull run.""We won't attempt to make short-term predictions on the price, but bitcoin's core fundamentals and value proposition remain unchanged."" Ting said.      Bitcoin is changing hands near $48,000 at press time, and the SMA is located at $49,470, according to CoinDesk 20 data.
