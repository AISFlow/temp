Ethereum And Google Trends &apos;The last time Vitalik surged on Google Trends, $ETH pumped 2x from April-May,&apos; a Twitter user noted while showing a recent surge of the founder&apos;s name: To see if this could actually be taken into account as a possible indicator, we compared different moments in time in which Vitalik Buterin has surged on Google Trends and the price action that followed. In the following chart we can see the most relevant moments during 2022: And tracing back to 2021, we can further see this price action (yellow arrows still point at moments in which &apos;Vitalik Buterin&apos; surged on Google Trends): But does it really mean the price has increased after people get interested in googling Vitalik? The trending searches most likely followed these news: Buterin revealing he has burnt 505 trillion SHIB tokens in January 2022; similar SHIBA related news in October 2021; earlier in the same month he trended after calling El Salvador&apos;s decision of making Bitcoin a legal tender &apos;reckless&apos;; then on August of the same year, it was the five-year anniversary of Ethereum and he addressed several issues and the complexity of Ether...",POSITIVE,ETH | SHIB,BTC | ETH | REGULATION | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/the-weird-relationship-between-ethereum-price-and-vitalik-buterin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The “Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act” was introduced by Sens. James Risch (R-Idaho), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on Feb. 16.  “As El Salvador has adopted [b]itcoin as legal tender, it’s important we understand and mitigate potential risks to the U.S. financial system,” Risch said in a statement on Wednesday. He added the legislation would require the State and Treasury departments, among other federal agencies, to mitigate risks such as potential empowerment of China and organized criminal organizations.  The bill would also ask the U.S. to monitor remittances from El Salvador.  El Salvador President Nayib Bukele expressed his discontent after the bill passed out of committee.  “Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that the U.S. [g]overnment would be afraid of what we are doing here,” he tweeted on Wednesday afternoon.  El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender last autumn, launching a government-backed wallet and offering incentives for bitcoin usage.

42435232,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBuMn1,1648075101,"First Mover Asia: With Finance Bill Vote, India Continues to Reckon With the Growing Crypto Industry; Bitcoin, Ether Tread Water","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Insights: The Indian Parliament's expected passage of a finance bill that includes a high crypto tax will end a seven-week debate, but at what cost?  Technician's take: Buyers remain active on pullbacks, keeping support levels intact.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.

Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $42,464 -0.4%  Ether (ETH): $3,011 +0.1%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cardano ADA +9.0% Smart Contract Platform Dogecoin DOGE +4.7% Currency Polkadot DOT +4.4% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC −5.0% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin Cash BCH −4.8% Currency XRP XRP −1.1% Currency  Bitcoin, ether go sideways but other major cryptos shine  Bitcoin and ether were trading sideways but other major cryptocurrencies continued the largely bullish trend of the past few days.  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was recently holding above $42,400, roughly where it perched 24 hours ago. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was about as flat over the same period. Cardano's ADA and Axie Infinity's AXS were the stars of the day, each rising about 10%. Popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB were solidly in the green, as was SAND.  Alternative coin prices veered mostly from equity markets, which lost momentum after a series of increases dating to late last week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 were both off 1.2%.  While the jump in altcoins seemed to underscore at least a temporary appetite for riskier assets, investors also continue to watch macroeconomic conditions warily and are largely holding a more cautious posture.  The horror images from Ukraine showed no sign of ending as Russia continued its rocket and artillery attacks on major cities, even as it continued to suffer its own massive casualties and loss of equipment. In a statement Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the Russian army of war crimes, although he did not mention Russian President Vladimir Putin by name. U.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Brussels to discuss NATO imposing even more severe sanctions against Russia, although German Chancellor Olaf Scholz seemed to reaffirm his country's decision not to boycott Russian energy products during a speech to lawmakers.  Scholz said a boycott could spur the loss of ""hundreds of thousands of jobs"" and send Germany and Europe as a whole into recession.  Brent crude oil was selling at $114 per barrel, down from a March peak of $130 but up 50% from the start of 2022.  Oanda Americas Senior Analyst Edward Moya struck an optimistic note in an emailed analysis of investment assets, including crypto, describing bitcoin's holding pattern above $40,000 as ""a good thing for long-term investors. Moya said bitcoin was ""performing nicely given today's risk-aversion theme.""  He added: ""Bitcoin should remain a sideways trade until Wall Street makes up its mind as to whether equities can continue to perform well with all the geopolitical uncertainty at hand.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,456 -1.2%  DJIA: 34,358 -1.2%  Nasdaq: 13,922 -1.3%  Gold: $1,946 +1.3%  Insights  India reckons with the growing crypto industry  Is Parliament's likely yes vote on a finance bill that contains laws on crypto taxation the end of the saga? Or is it an intermediary step, albeit a big one, until India develops its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), or even beyond?  Whatever the answer, India is reckoning with the fledgling industry's rapid growth. The country is finding, as others are worldwide, that there are no blueprints on how to regulate crypto without hamstringing the innovation that makes it special or enraging its growing number of investors and advocates.  Crypto has created its own category.  It has presented legislators in India and other countries where developers and investors have established a toehold with new challenges.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government seems to have adopted deterrence at least until the digital rupee arrives as the cornerstone of the country's crypto policy. The passing of the finance bill without reducing crypto taxes, which is expected later Thursday, offers yet another example of India's uncompromising stance against crypto.  On Feb. 1, India announced the stiff crypto taxation proposals – a 30% capital gains tax, a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS), no offsetting of losses, and taxation of gifts – along with its plans to launch a CBDC by the end of the financial year 2022-23. Since then, the industry had pleaded with the government to tone down its taxation policy, particularly the 1% TDS.  The government said that gains from the trading of one cryptocurrency could not offset losses from the trading of another cryptocurrency. Investors and the crypto industry have expressed disappointment with the likely outcome, which came after groups had lobbied lawmakers and tried to win public support with presentations and other activities.  Brain drain  Among their criticisms, crypto advocates have said the law will cost India some of its brightest technology minds.  This report published Tuesday supported their criticism, saying there were signs of a brain drain that was likely to worsen once the bill becomes law.  ***  India has viewed crypto suspiciously as it has become more popular. In April 2018, the Indian central bank effectively prohibited banks from supporting or engaging in crypto transactions, although the Supreme Court overturned the ban two years later.  As prices started to climb in late 2020 and early 2021, the government softened its stance. Proposed crypto-specific regulation evolved from prohibiting “all private cryptocurrencies in India” while allowing “for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses,” to enabling cryptocurrency to be used as an asset but banning its use as currency or payment.  In announcing the finance bill, the government didn’t introduce this crypto specific regulation. Instead, it said it was seeking global consensus to frame regulation.  Meanwhile, reports suggested that the central bank and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which regulates markets, would punish violators of crypto regulations with non-bailable warrants and/or fines and jail time.  The biggest signpost of what’s to happen over the next few days is the opinion of the man who was responsible for the government’s first position on cryptocurrencies in the form of a report.  Whatever is to come, some policy experts believe Indians have a penchant for managing or making do or coming up with the craziest solutions to the darkest circumstances. They even have a word for it – jugaad!  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holds Support Above $40K; Initial Resistance at $46K  Bitcoin (BTC) pullbacks have been limited during the Asia trading day, suggesting that buyers could remain active above the $40,000 support level. There is room for additional upside, although resistance at $46,700 could stall the price bounce.  Bitcoin's trading volume remains low relative to prior highs, although a decisive breakout above $46,000 could encourage additional buying activity. For now, BTC remains in a month-long trading range and is attempting to reverse a four-month long downtrend.  Elsewhere, the recent outperformance in alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as ether (ETH) relative to bitcoin indicates bullish sentiment among traders. That means higher trading ranges are expected over the short term.

The token could break above $0.27 and rally to February 2022 highs. Past Performance The GALA price remains in consolidation inside a bull flag considering gains over the past few months. GALA has been stable in the past 24 hours but is up 11 percent in the previous trading week. Overall, bulls are in a commanding position, sustaining prices inside the broader ascending wedge with clear support at $0.21 marked by March 16 lows. GALA Technical Analysis The path of least resistance is northwards based on the recent price performance. Technically, GALA prices are consolidating, trading inside a narrow $0.07 trade range with caps at $0.27 and $0.20 on the upper and lower ends. There has been confirmation of the bullish engulfing bar of March 16, suggesting strength. Aggressive traders can load the dip inside the March 16 trade range above $0.20 with targets at $0.27 and later $0.38—marking February 2022 highs. What to Expect Blockchain gaming and NFTs are finding widespread adoption—a fundamental factor supporting GALA bulls in the long haul. The immediate resistance level is at $0.27. However, if prices crash below $0.20, the token may drop towards 2022 lows of $0.17.The post GALA Prices inside a Bull Flag, Surges 11% as Buyers Target $0.38 appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,GALA,BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | MARKET | TRADING | GALA,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/gala-prices-inside-a-bull-flag-surges-11-as-buyers-target-0-38/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Digital Currency Group (DCG), Hypersphere, Defi Alliance and D1 Ventures led the round at a $60 million valuation, according to a press release. (DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.)  Joystream seeks to act as a decentralized YouTube, according to Chief Marketing Officer Robert Neckelius. Creators can mint their videos as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Joystream blockchain, and each channel has its own native token. Consumers can invest in their favorite creator's success, as well as take profits from their NFT sales on the platform.  It’s part of a broader crypto movement that aims to empower individual creators over corporations. While content stalwarts such as YouTube tightly govern how their creators make money (and grant them limited say in how the platform evolves) Joystream’s planned decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) would hand over the keys.  “Giving the stakeholders the tools required to decide, fund and direct the operation and evolution of the system is a much more durable approach, and one which is going to make it much more attractive for developers to build applications on top of Joystream,” said Bedeho Mender, CEO of the primary company building Joystream, called Jsgenesis.  According to Mender, the startup, which has been around since 2015, was originally building atop the BitTorrent protocol. It pivoted to creating a video platform in 2018 and has been preparing for mainnet launch ever since.  Right now it’s preparing to launch a mainnet in Q2 or Q3 of this year that will allow for a custom DAO, an NFT marketplace for creator’s videos and a platform for creator’s to monetize their videos with their own tokens. Currently on the testnet, there are 3,434 memberships and creators have been paid out $132,301 thus far.  Other decentralized video platforms such as LBRY and DTube are more limited in scope, hosting crypto tipping.  In a phone interview, Neckelius told CoinDesk the funding will help Joystream recruit creators and is setting aside $12 million in JOY tokens as an incentive. The company is “committed to attracting high talent to control the DAO,” he said.

Lawmakers hailed the pilot legislation Wednesday as putting the bloc at the “forefront of innovation.”  The measure was first proposed by the European Commission. It will give EU members the chance to test out new crypto applications that would otherwise be blocked by existing laws governing financial market infrastructure.  “It is not only vital to make existing financial legislation fit for digital, but also to show an openness towards new technology that could make financial markets safer and more efficient,” said Parliament member Johan Van Overtveldt, who negotiated the deal between Brussels and national governments that had been tentatively approved last year.  But Van Overtveldt, who previously served as Belgium’s finance minister, warned that crypto experiments that appeared to work on a small scale might still raise unexpected risks if they move beyond the pilot stage.  “What works in a limited testing environment does not necessarily work in a broader context,” he said, adding that lawmakers in the future would need to “thoroughly scrutinize the exemptions … before upscaling.”  Mairead McGuinness, the European Commission’s most senior financial-services official, hailed what she described as “groundbreaking work” that could enable financial markets to “safely experiment” with innovative technology more efficiently by allowing traditional financial instruments like stocks, bonds and exchange-traded funds to be tokenized in spite of strictures normally contained in EU law.  The plans, which now seem set to pass into law, represent a relatively pro-innovation move from a legislative body that is also dabbling with ending anonymity in online payments and limiting proof-of-work assets like Bitcoin because of their supposed environmental impact.  For some lawmakers, the pilot goes too far, and they say it amounts to a loophole in laws on financial trading and infrastructure intended to protect investors and safeguard financial stability.  Voting against the pilot project law “is not opposition to innovation,” said Ireland’s Chris MacManus, a member of Parliament’s far-left political caucus. Rather, his vote is “opposition to irresponsibility and industry lobbying leading to a pilot project spiraling into what would be effectively be an exercise in deregulation.”  Read more: MiCA Could Still Be Delayed by EU Parliamentarians Over Proof-of-Work Provision",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/23/eu-set-to-experiment-with-blockchain-based-stock-bond-and-fund-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17d483c9313e7c466a599e37395d173e1fee5d16-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407272,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVUN3W,1648069815,"Don’t Blame NFT Artists for Mining’s Environmental Cost, Says Researcher Kyle McDonald","NFTs have been polarizing from the start.  When these pricey, crypto-backed JPEG files wormed their way into the mainstream early last year, there were far more questions than answers about what these things could actually do, and what, if anything, they meant for the future of digital art.  The biggest and most pressing of those questions had to do with non-fungible tokens’ relative energy consumption: Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies have long been known to require huge amounts of energy, much of which comes from cheap fossil fuels. How exactly do NFTs fit into that existing framework, and what’s the responsibility of artists looking to put their work on the blockchain?  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Mining Week series.  Kyle McDonald is an independent researcher and artist looking to answer some of these questions. Inspired by an online challenge from cantankerous bitcoin advocate [and CoinDesk columnist] Nic Carter, McDonald created a dashboard for determining the percentage of Ethereum transactions attributable to NFTs. Late last year, he shared another dashboard, this time looking at the emissions of the entire Ethereum network.  His work is informed by lessons learned from the early NFT backlash. Even if we understand in some vague way that crypto is bad for the environment, it’s important to have hard, current data to back it up.  Last spring, Memo Akten, an artist and assistant professor at the University of California at San Diego, devised his own methodology for calculating the carbon cost of a single NFT transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, and publicized it in a series of viral posts on social media; he took them down soon afterward, citing their role in directing “abuse and harassment” toward artists engaging with NFTs. (McDonald points to several errors in his work, which may have over-indexed those emissions numbers.) Another viral anti-crypto post from last spring called the ecological cost of NFTs a “crime against humanity,” but mostly cited studies that were woefully out of date.  Blockchains are essentially giant public lists of transactions; each new transaction added to the list is verified by a network of computers running special software. That verification process is at the heart of what makes blockchain networks “decentralized.” There’s no one central actor (say, a bank) signing off on every transaction and making sure it’s good to go.  It can also happen in one of a few different ways. These different processes are known as “consensus mechanisms” – the means by which this network of computers reaches agreement as to which transactions are legit.  The oldest consensus mechanism, known as “proof-of-work,” is structured as a kind of race between all the computers in the network: The first to crunch enough numbers and solve a complicated math problem is rewarded with a certain amount of the blockchain’s native token. It uses by far the most energy of any mainstream consensus mechanism, and is also the most popular. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Monero,and Zcash all operate this way.  Proof-of-work’s big rival is proof-of-stake – a consensus mechanism that selects computers to verify transactions according to the amount of cryptocurrency held, as opposed to the amount of computing power expended on one of those math problems. It uses significantly less electricity than proof-of-work.  Read More: What Is Cryptojacking? How to Protect Yourself Against Crypto Mining Malware  Scientists and data researchers tend to agree there’s already one sterling resource for quantifying the energy consumption of the bitcoin network, from Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance. Even Cambridge’s numbers are essentially guesses – its low estimates for energy consumption are 1/10th of the high estimates – but the analysis is more rigorous than it is for any comparable metrics for Ethereum. (The most commonly cited dashboard for Ethereum comes from Alex de Vries, the blogger and researcher behind the website Digiconomist.)  Looking past the hyperbole, McDonald’s work targets the numbers themselves, incorporating far-reaching data about chip performance and energy mixes for international power grids.  In a recent conversation with CoinDesk, McDonald explained how he put his Ethereum energy dashboards together, and what he thinks about the responsibility of artists making their way into the fraught crypto space.  The following Q&A has been edited and condensed.  How did your dashboards end up growing out of the debate around NFTs and carbon emissions?  I made the NFT activity one first, directly in response to Nic [Carter’s] bounty. Nic's bounty came about because there was a lot of discussion around that time about the emissions of art NFTs. This all started with Memo Akten releasing his crypto.wtf NFT emissions calculator, and then people started using it not just to check on their own emissions but to shame other artists for their emissions. And there are some problems with Memo's calculator. He had a bug in there for a little bit, where I think it pooled the entire emissions for the entire Foundation smart contract, and if you put one artwork in, it would end up pulling the entire platform. [Foundation is a popular NFT marketplace – it launched on Ethereum, switched to a low-emissions layer 2, or companion, system called xDai in late 2020 and then eventually switched back to Ethereum.] It just made it look like anybody who put in from that platform had a ton of emissions that was super-disproportionate to anybody else. And eventually he took it down, because he felt like his main point had been made.  But around that time, and I think even before he took it down, Nic posted this bounty saying, “I don't think that NFTs are the majority of the activity on the Ethereum – maybe it's misplaced to be blaming artists for the emissions of Ethereum when it's not even the main thing that Ethereum’s doing.” And this was true. It’s always been less than 20% of Ethereum activity, with a few brief spikes. I think, though, that he was also engaging with his other question, which was how do we assign responsibility for emissions within this network where emissions do not go up or down depending on how many people are using the network? And then there was this third thing, which was like, “Are these emissions numbers that we're working from in the first place even right?”  There's this paradigm in carbon accounting where if you can't really find a direct correlation – like a marginal change in emissions – based on your use of a service, then one way that you can compute emissions is by looking at how much you pay for that service versus how much that service is raking in from everybody. This is an idea called value-based carbon accounting, and that's sort of the approach I've been taking when thinking about NFTs.  It comes down to transaction fees. What people are paying to use the system should be a kind of proportional marker of what their emissions responsibility is. So instead of looking at the number of transactions, I look at the fees to make an estimate of what percentage of the Ethereum network’s emissions belong to NFTs. And that's been hovering somewhere between 15% and 20% for the last few months. And it was also around 15% to 20%, towards the end of last year, with a little lull around the New Year.  What about the overall emissions dashboard?  I started working on that because when the first NFT debate was happening, with Memo’s stuff, there were people like Sterling Crispin and other artists who were pushing back and saying, “All this stuff is based on the work from Alex de Vries – Digiconomist – and who even trusts his stuff? Is this really good science?” I think Alex actually has done a lot of great work on this topic, but he's also very loud and opinionated. And he has, I think, created some misdirection. For example, he talks about, “per-transaction emissions.” And I understand why he does that, it gives you a useful understanding of scale. But it also misleads people by making them think that every transaction has a marginal [cost in] energy or emissions. And so he's gotten a lot of blowback from the crypto community for those kinds of things.  I saw that and I thought, to have this discussion we need to have some kind of trustworthy source. Where are we going to find that?  I need to know, what is the data center overhead, the PUE [power usage effectiveness]? What is the grid loss for the different places where Ethereum is running? What is the hashing efficiency of all the different GPUs [graphics processing units], or the PSU [power supply unit] efficiencies? I tried to do my best to get real answers to each of these questions, and then piece them together like a big puzzle. I looked at a ton of GPU benchmarks and really tried to understand how hashing efficiency has changed over time with the release of different GPUs.  How do you even begin figuring that out? How many of these data farms and mining centers actually report what equipment they’re using, and what sources their power grids are drawing energy from?  There’s a few good tricks here. Once you know that 30% or 40% of the mining is happening in China around 2020, then you can look at China and say, “Well, what do we know about China?” We know that miners are moving from South China, like, Sichuan, to Xinjiang in the Northwest, and they're going back and forth with the wet season. So they can take advantage of the hydropower. And then you can find basically government documents from China, as well as external estimates of the energy mix from companies that are interested in getting good prices for their electricity, and use that as a proxy for understanding what the energy mix of the miners is. There's always the possibility that, you know, a bunch of the mining in a region is actually off-grid, and it's using electricity sources that are not connected to the grid at all, but I haven't found an indication for Ethereum that that's a major thing. I think for Bitcoin it's much more true that there's a lot of off-grid mining. Like, there's something like 1% to 2% of bitcoin which is mined using flared gas, which is not connected to any grid at all, in Texas, mainly.  The question about the GPU mix is actually a little more direct, in some ways. There's two services I looked at for that. When you register your workers with Nanopool, they actually publish your “worker” IDs publicly. So, if you go into your Ethereum farm and you name your workers “3070-row one-column three” or something, then I can go in and see they're using 3070 GPUs to do this mining. And I can also see what your hashrate is on that collection of GPUs and do that for a ton of GPUs and then use that to extrapolate to the ones that I don't know about.  And then I can also kind of cross-check it against one other resource, which is [HiveOS]. It’s a tool that people use on their big farms, and they use it to keep track of how the GPUs are running.  There have been a lot of arguments, mostly from companies in the industry, that bitcoin mined with flared gas is actually good for the environment because it mops up extra gas that would otherwise be burned on-site at refineries. On the other hand, it’s a process that piggybacks on existing gas businesses. What’s your take on that argument?  There's two main things that come up, which are the kind of pro-energy argument for proof-of-work, which basically is [that it uses up] flared gas and stranded energy sources, and proof-of-work as a controllable load resource – something that is constantly providing this base load of demand that can be turned off to provide some additional capacity.  I think it's complicated because bitcoin is genuinely reducing emissions through flared gas mining. However, the portion of emissions that it's reducing is so minuscule compared to the portion of emissions that it's incentivizing. I'm not sure that's a great argument. The other thing with flared gas mining is a lot of the places where that's happening right now, [local governments are] considering just telling oil well operators to just stop flaring it – just bottle it up and sell it.  It turns out the reason they don't do that is because it's expensive. But if you get the government to make people do things that are slightly more expensive, it turns out it doesn't necessarily end their whole operation. It can be a net benefit for everybody.  Read More: What Does a Crypto Mining Farm Look Like? Striking Photos From Siberia to Spain  I also have to admit, like, yes, bitcoin is a controllable load resource [CLR]. Yes, it has actually added capacity to the West Texas grid in the winter, when they turned it off. At the same time, I'm still not convinced that it's the best way to do things. I think a lot of these pro-bitcoin arguments are right – bitcoin does some good things. I don't know if it's the best way to do those things.  With this situation of bitcoin being a CLR – so are car batteries for electric vehicles [EVs], and I think there's a lot of potential that has yet to be unlocked in terms of recharging EVs at the right time of day in a way that can take advantage of more renewables. I think EVs, even now, have more potential than bitcoin as a resource on the grid to provide a little bit of that backup capacity.  I know bitcoiners would like to see bitcoin as something with everyday utility, but it's really hard for me to accept that argument when there's proof-of-stake coins that seem to be operating in a similar way to proof-of-work coins.  Is there a kind of cynicism baked into the idea that governments shouldn’t be playing a role in this stuff?  I think the crypto project in general is about being free from regulation and oversight. And I understand that, I understand that feeling – I don't want to have a boot on my neck either. But the extreme vision of that gets into this zone where no one is accountable to anybody anymore, and we're not really listening to each other about what we all want the future to be, or crafting it together. It's just sort of giving up to market forces. And I'm not resigned to that. I think the only future that is workable is a future that we figure out together.  We’re in the middle of climate change right now, and there's not space for “trying stuff out” at this point. We know what we need to do, and it’s massive reductions [in emissions]. And proof-of-work is not helping with that right now. There is a way to get rid of proof-of-work, and it's not by banning mining, because people will just move to places where it's still allowed. But the way to get rid of proof-of-work is by banning crypto exchanges that trade proof-of-work coins, and to not allow them to exchange between fiat and proof-of-work coins. I think that will severely dent the volume and market cap of proof-of-work coins, if you’re not allowed to hold them and you're not allowed to trade them at the exchange level.  Would you advocate for that?  I would advocate for government-imposed restrictions on exchanges trading proof-of-work coins. I don't know yet that I would advocate for restrictions on holding proof-of-work coins because I think the kind of oversight that's required to make that happen is getting into a very surveillance-y society, beyond what we have now. And I'm not really interested in regulations that can’t be implemented.  I think a lot of bitcoiners, Nic Carter among them, see proof-of-work as the real innovation, and proof-of-stake as essentially traditional centralized computing with a crypto sheen – to them, saying you’d ban it is probably like saying you’d ban what’s worthwhile about the project of crypto. How do you balance that with the question of preserving the environment?  Read More: After Short-Lived Ban, City in Upstate NY Is Still Reckoning With Crypto Miners  He wouldn't even see it as a thing to balance because he looks at the idea of proof-of-work as a good, as a CLR. He says this is incentivizing renewables, which in some weird way is a little true. It's just not the thing that I want to see incentivizing renewables. When you get really down to it, I don't know that it's about the environmental question at root level, because you can make some environmental arguments for proof-of-work.  Is it tied up with a broader culture war around crypto?  It's about this war between whether we should all be able to figure this out independently, through market forces, or whether it's something that we need to figure out together, interdependent instead of independent. And, yeah, I've got a perspective on that, and a lot of bitcoiners feel exactly the opposite.  The battle is currently being lost by my side, and I don't know yet that it's going to change around, but we'll see. Canada has put restrictions on how much proof-of-work mining can happen there, Kazakhstan has restrictions on how much proof-of-work mining can happen there. When we continue to see more restrictions like that, I think we're going to have to start asking, how much do we really want to be doing this?  As far as I can tell from anything we have up to this point, [crypto] is the acceleration of all of the deregulation. It's an acceleration of the “capital always wins” situation.  What responsibility do artists have, at this point, to mitigate their own emissions through NFTs?  This idea of personal responsibility in the context of emissions was kind of co-opted in 2005, when [advertising firm] Ogilvy made the carbon footprint campaign for BP. This huge oil company was realizing that they had an impending crisis on their hands, because people were going to start realizing very soon that climate change was due to their company. And what they decided to do was to say, “Okay, well, look away from us for a second and look at yourself. Maybe it's your problem.” This idea of the personal carbon footprint – that was an ad campaign. That wasn't something that scientists came up with or economists came up with.  Read More: Why Some Bitcoin Devs Say Lasers Can Cut Mining’s Energy Costs  That ad campaign was so successful that we still have this idea of personal responsibility being the most important thing. And we kind of lost, culturally, our ability to hold large polluters accountable and people with power accountable. So what I feel about the personal responsibility of artists is, yes, you need to follow your conscience. And there's a lot that you can do as an individual to make a difference. But ultimately, if that is distracting you from holding power accountable, it's a problem.  I don't want to focus on whether any individual artists should be or should not be working with proof-of-work. I want to focus on the exchanges, the marketplaces, places like the Ethereum Foundation, that still [have] some ability to guide whether proof-of-work is used or not, and make plans around it and allocate resources to it.  Every dollar that's taken away from supporting proof-of-work is well spent.  The other thing with “decentralized” systems is that it can be hard to know who to hold accountable.  Theoretically, yes. But practically, there’s still Infura [the Ethereum APIs developed by the software giant ConsenSys]. There's still the Ethereum Foundation. There's still all of these centralized points where there are individual people that are keeping things running, and individual organizations keeping things running. Web 3 people haven't solved this goal of having a truly decentralized web yet. You still have servers, you still have organizations that are providing API endpoints.  In a way there’s also an opportunity for accountability, in crypto, because so much of the data is transparent.  One of the reasons this has been such a big topic is because it is legible. When you look at Facebook or Google, all you've got is their ESG [environment, social, governance] reports or sustainability reports. And then you go through there and you're like, “Okay, theoretically this is from a third party, but also Google hired them to make this, they probably want to make it look good somehow.” And then you've got things that are totally impenetrable, like the U.S. military. It is incredibly intangible, there is no blockchain for the military that we can analyze to figure out how many emissions there are.  We need to keep the pressure on here, because this is something new, and it's probably something like one whole percent of all global emissions. But we shouldn't let it distract us from some of the bigger issues too, like transportation and electricity more broadly.

42422856,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qU3h,1648068274,"Market Wrap: Altcoins Outperform Bitcoin, Traders Cautiously Await Breakouts","Bullish sentiment is returning to crypto markets after a sluggish start to the year. The recent outperformance of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) indicates a greater appetite for risk among traders.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were down 1% over 24 hours, compared with an 8% rise in Cardano's ADA token and a 3% jump in dogecoin (DOGE). Meanwhile, LRC, the native token on the Ethereum scaling network Loopring, rallied as much as 34% after the blockchain project shared an update on its partnership with GameStop (GME).  Some analysts expect crypto prices to remain elevated over the short term, albeit in a higher range. That means a relief rally could be short-lived. For reference, BTC's prior range between $30,000-$40,000 earlier this year preceded the current range between $40,000-$45,000, indicating a decline in selling pressure.  ""There will be an upper limit to prices of risk assets, depending on how big [Federal Reserve] rate hikes will be,"" Justin Chuh, a trader at Wave Financial, said during an interview with CoinDesk. Chuh also mentioned that some traders have not been picking price bottoms. Instead, traders have been unwinding downside hedges and selling volatility contracts as prices stabilize, according to Chuh.  From a technical perspective, short-term indicators are improving for bitcoin. ""We expect recent highs near $45,000 to soon be cleared as a positive catalyst,"" Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies wrote in a report. ""A breakout earlier this month suggested bitcoin has upside toward $51,000.""  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $42,334, −0.36%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,978, −0.81%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,456, −1.23%    ●Gold: $1,947 per troy ounce, +1.38%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.32%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Tepid breakouts  Open interest, or the total amount of outstanding contracts in the bitcoin futures market, has stabilized over the past few months. That could point to fewer liquidations as bitcoin trades within a narrow price range, according to a report by Arcane Research.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices, as opposed to spot trading, where traders own the actual assets.  ""We’ve rarely seen open interest being maintained at such levels for such a long duration without any major squeeze setbacks,"" Arcane wrote. Low trading activity doesn't last long, however, which means a breakout of the current BTC trading range could be imminent.  The chart in the second panel below shows the 30-day volatility of BTC open interest, which is far lower than the previous lows of 2% seen in July, late August and early December, which preceded brief upticks in trading activity.  Still, some indicators show a high degree of uncertainty among bitcoin traders, which suggests upswings in price could be limited.  For example, funding rates, or the cost holding long BTC positions in perpetual futures listed on major exchanges, have been neutral/negative over the past few months. That means sentiment among traders is neither bullish or bearish (lacking conviction) despite bitcoin's 30% advance from its Jan. 24 price low near $33,000.

42407271,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gVUMqI,1648068148,The Future of Mining Finance: Time to Get Creative,"Access to capital is the backbone of any industry, not least of all for cryptocurrency-linked companies that are relatively young and in a hyper-growth mode. For digital asset miners, the need for capital is more pronounced because these companies require a large amount of funding for infrastructure and equipment to prosper.  This post is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week.  In 2021, when bitcoin (BTC) was hitting new highs, investors were pouring money into miners both private and public. But now that bitcoin and the broader crypto market have been pulled off from their peak from last year, the capital market has dried up for the digital asset industry as investors became more risk averse.  With miners’ margins being compressed from their peak of as much as 90% to around 60% to 70% this year, thriving in the brutally competitive industry has become even more challenging.  That hasn’t stopped miners from spending to expand their companies by adding mining computers and processing power, or hashrate. Most of them have signed contracts to receive mining computers throughout this year.  Read more: 8 Trends That Will Shape Bitcoin Mining in 2022  So how can mining companies raise capital for growth, assuming the bitcoin price stays at current levels for a prolonged period of time and investors remain skeptical of risky assets?  Miners will need to get creative and are likely to go through a period of consolidation, according to industry experts and participants.  Why invest in crypto miners?  Before digging deeper into the future of mining finance, let's get this often-asked question answered first: Why invest in mining companies when an investor can just simply buy digital assets from an exchange?  The main reason investors put their money into public crypto mining equities is because they act as a proxy for investing in bitcoin, given that many institutional investors remain hesitant to invest directly in cryptocurrencies due to regulatory concerns. Theoretically, by investing in mining equities that hold onto their mined bitcoin, investors are gaining a way to profit on the mined currency at a lower cost than its market price, while owning a real business. At the same time, shares of the public miners are easy for these traditional investors to buy or sell. No need to set up a fancy bitcoin wallet or open an account with some online exchange or specialized market maker; just call your stockbroker as usual.  “Public miners are the best option for most investors because they provide exposure to this fast-growing asset class through their existing portfolios with liquidity to more optimally enter and exit positions,” said Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer of publicly traded mining company Bitfarms (BITF).  Particularly, in a down market, publicly traded miners can offer a better value for investors as their prices are highly correlated (sometimes as much as 70%) with those of crypto assets and the shares often provide a better upside when the market eventually rallies.  “Given the market is weaker and mining is more discounted, it is advantageous to invest in mining as miners function effectively as leveraged exposure to bitcoin,” Gagnon added.  Year of reckoning for crypto mining industry  However, such high correlation also exposes investors to the downside.  If broader cryptocurrency prices decline significantly, as seen this year, the miners’ shares react even more swiftly, causing a sea of red for investors. This is when funding dries up and investors start to scrutinize individual miners and look for companies that can differentiate themselves from the pack in the long run, rather than buying all the equities in bulk.  On top of that, during the rally of 2021 lucrative margins brought in many new entrants into the sector, saturating it with too many miners with similar business models. This became a problem when bitcoin prices pulled back from their peak.  “Investors have expressed frustration with a seeming lack of differentiation in the digital asset mining industry,” said Wall Street investment bank B Riley’s analyst Lucas Pipes in a recent research note.  Access to capital will be fairly limited for miners that cannot distinguish themselves from the pack.  “I think what you're going to see, hopefully, in 2022, ‘the year of reckoning’ for some of the publicly traded miners, where the market really starts to mature and starts to recognize all the publicly traded miners on an individual basis,” said John Warren, CEO of privately held bitcoin mining company GEM Mining, which was formed recently, after raising over $200 million in institutional capital.  Investors will likely dig deeper into the publicly traded companies’ growth plans and ask if they have paid for the mining computers that they said they would. If they haven't, the question becomes whether these miners have enough cash to pay for the machines, Warren said. If they don’t, they will have to raise money by issuing more equity – and diluting their shareholders’ stakes.  Pipes said he expects a “greater differentiation” this year among the miners, as they try to reach the targets in their business plans and pursue further exposure in adjacent markets. Pipes said miners that vertically integrate, or own their own infrastructure for power and hosting mining machines, are “ideally positioned for this evolution.” (Think of Netflix (NFLX) producing the shows it streams or, going further back, Ford Motor Company (F) making its own steel rather than buying it.)  As examples of this change in mining business, Pipes pointed to Stronghold Mining (SDIG), which is using power for both digital mining and open market electricity sales, as well as Hut 8’s (HUT) data center business that is used for both digital asset mining and cloud computing.  In fact, diversification has become a theme among the miners recently, to differentiate themselves from their peers. Most recently, miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) launched an in-house unit that does a variety of things other than mining in the blockchain ecosystem and miner Hut 8 bought a cloud and colocation data center business from TeraGo to branch out into Web 3 infrastructures.  A maturing market  In a market where investors are looking for a unique investment case among a surfeit of miners, if a public company tries to raise capital by offering shares, it will dilute the shareholders, and the stock will likely be punished. Meanwhile, raising debt could also become expensive as lenders might demand higher interest rates for a growing company. To stay profitable in a hotly competitive market, miners will need to find creative ways to fund their growth plans.  “As investors become more mature, so do the financial products,” according to Ruslan Zinurov, CEO of privately held bitcoin mining company Merkle Standard, which recently announced a partnership with miner manufacturer Bitmain to develop a data center with up to 500 megawatts of capacity.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining and ESG: A Match Made in Heaven  “The offerings available for miners today are vastly different from what was available even six months ago,” Zinurov said. However, it seems that asset backed loans (ABL) will become a popular option for miners, he added.  In February, bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK) said in an earnings call that given the company has top-of-the-line, latest-generation ASIC mining machines, it will use them as leverage to raise capital.  “We believe this makes us attractive to asset-backed lenders and we are exploring the use of the ABL or similar facilities to provide the growth capital needed to expand our operations,” the company’s chief financial officer, Gary Vecchiarelli said. CleanSpark said other options include monetizing some of the company's bitcoin holdings, which doesn’t necessarily mean only selling it; the company could deposit coins with a crypto lender to earn yield, as well.  Another form of financing that has been seen recently is bitcoin-backed loans. Last year in December, Bitfarms raised a $100 million bitcoin-backed loan from Galaxy Digital. Aside from miners, even Goldman Sachs (GS) and other Wall Street banks are exploring options of such crypto-backed loans.  Soon, there likely will be more financial options that come along, according to GEM’s Warren.  “As the market matures, you're going to see more bank financing come in, and then you're going to have funds and different lenders take lines of credit from the banks in order to loan it out and that's going to bring down the cost of capital for all of the miners significantly,” he explained.  Read more: Pipe Introduces Alternative Financing Product for Bitcoin Miners  But for now, Warren thinks bitcoin-backed loans are one of the cheapest forms of debt that’s available to the miners, followed by machine financing. He thinks convertible debts are expensive at the moment, given the market is still very young.  “Again, because it's an immature market, and it's just so expensive to take that convertible debt, if you can do the machine financing, I think that's a better deal,” Warren said.  M&A becoming ‘more real’  However, the cash crunch could become a reality for the miners as margins compress, particularly if the bitcoin price remains stagnant for a prolonged period of time and capital remains scarce while competition intensifies.  Such a scenario would usher in an age of consolidation among the miners, particularly the ones that are smaller in size and not cashed up, according to Fred Thiel, CEO of one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA).  “If you are a smaller company, trying to grow, it’s gonna get very difficult,” he said. “I think [cash-strapped] companies are going to start struggling within the next year or two,” he said. Potential acquisition targets are the companies that might have access to a lot of mining computers but either didn’t deploy them or didn’t have the capital to pay for them.  “You'll see M&A start becoming something more real later this year and into the next year,” Thiel said.  This was echoed by Sue Ennis, vice president of corporate development at Hut 8.  “It’s possible we will see some industry consolidation as the hashrate grows, particularly if the current economic, geopolitical, and inflationary environments remain volatile,” Ennis said.

It was from this date that the long-term correction in the SAND market began, which corrected the growth wave from October by about 70%. During the whole period of SAND price correction, the trading volumes decreased significantly. This fact indicates the reluctance of large investors to fix profits and give up their positions. Therefore, the probability of the beginning of the formation of the SAND cryptocurrency&apos;s new growth wave is quite high. https://www.tradingview.com/x/jFDqsmNO/ At the time of writing, the price is near the important liquidity zone of $2.7. At this critical point, buyers have been in circulation since mid-January 2022. And since the end of February 2022, the SAND market has formed a fairly narrow consolidation in the range of $2.7-$3.5. If buyers manage to keep the $2.7 mark and take control of the $3.5 mark in March, the baseline scenario for the SAND price will grow to $5.2. However, even if sellers break the $2.7 mark, the positive trend in the SAND market will continue. The fact is that the SAND price from January 2021 is moving in the global growth channel. The bottom line of the global growth channel is close to $1.7. Therefore, in the case of a deep correction of the BTC price and its return to the range of $38,000-$39,000 SAND cryptocurrency may make the final fall wave.

If November 2021 was the beginning of the price fall wave, UNI began its correction in May. During this correction, investors experienced two fall waves. The first, which took place in May, was quite panic and powerful. In just one week, sellers were able to lower the price by 60%. However, in order to organize the next fall wave with the final result, 75% of sellers took almost 200 days. Nobody has seen aggressive sales on the UNI market for a long time. At the moment, the UNI price is falling at low volumes in the hope of finding a strong buyer. Starting from the end of February, buyers managed to stop the process of updating local lows and the reversal process began. The critical point, breaking which buyers will regain the initiative in the market is the mark of $11.7. In our opinion, the formation of consolidation in the range of $8-$11.7 will allow buyers to gain strength to storm the global liquidity level of $14.5. The importance of this level can be seen in the way buyers kept it from May 2021 to January 2022. However, organizing a foothold for a new growth wave in the range of $8-$11.7 breaking the $14.5 mark will be a matter of time.

While mining requires some technological understanding, it is not as complex as it may seem. Here are the steps to mine cryptocurrency so even as a beginner, you can quickly get started and begin earning.

Bush and Barack Obama, will advise MoonPay’s executives and compliance officials as the startup further establishes its systems for allowing people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies using a range of payment methods, such as credit cards, bank transfers and Apple Pay, the company said in a statement.  “As MoonPay works to bring the next billion people into the crypto economy, Jim brings an unparalleled wealth of experience to the business and will be instrumental in helping us continue our growth,” Ivan Soto-Wright, chief executive officer and founder of MoonPay, said in a statement.  MoonPay, which said it is valued at $3.4 billion after closing a Series A funding round last November, is registered with FinCEN as a money-services business, in addition to having money transmitter licenses held in 36 states, according to the company.

However, several in the industry say they’re not that concerned about the potential new rules and even welcome them.  The SEC’s proposal would require publicly traded companies to report greenhouse-gas emissions from their operations and from the energy they consume, and some to obtain independent certification of their estimates. Among crypto-linked companies, digital asset miners would be the most affected by such rules, given their demand for large amounts of energy to run their operations.

With the U.S. becoming the digital asset mining capital of the world, after China’s sweeping ban on the crypto sector, the impact of crypto mining on the environment has become a big debate both in the U.S. and around the world. Most recently, the Environmental Conservation Committee of the New York State Assembly voted on Tuesday afternoon to move along a proposed law that would ban so-called proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency mining for two years. Earlier this month, a similar PoW ban narrowly failed to pass in a European Union Parliament committee vote.  These efforts to regulate the mining industry may not have come into effect yet, but it shows that lawmakers around the world and U.S. are taking a hard look at the environmental impact of crypto mining. “The SEC’s agenda isn’t startling, given Gary Gensler’s past statements and the Biden administration's goal to tackle perceived climate risks,” said Will Foxley, content director at bitcoin mining service provider Compass Mining, as well as co-host of CoinDesk TV’s ""The Hash.""

Striking Photos From Siberia to Spain  An advantage for larger firms  The SEC’s proposal will be open for public comment for at least two months before the agency will begin its work on a final rule. However, if the proposal requires companies to report more detailed emission disclosures, it may be challenging to comply with, said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark (CLSK), a Nasdaq-listed bitcoin miner that uses renewable energy sources.  Overall, the bill would require firms to disclose their governance of climate-related risk; the material impact, if any, of those risks on a firm’s business, strategy or outlook; and how these risks might affect its financial statements. Bradford thinks this part will be easily handled by miners.  However, the proposed bill would also require companies to disclose varying levels of information about their own emissions. Scope 1 pertains to direct greenhouse (GHG) emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an organization – for example emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, furnaces and vehicles, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat or cooling. Finally, the bill would also require some companies to report Scope 3 details, which include the emission disclosures of its supply chain and customers.  This level of detail might take a long time for miners and other companies to comply with. “I would expect that reporting of level 1 and level 2 emissions in a mandatory fashion will encounter an uphill battle,” Bradford said, adding that complying with them will be “fairly heavy and expensive lift, especially for smaller filers.”  Compass’s Foxley agreed. “The difficulty for miners comes in terms of reporting. More regulation means more paperwork, which increases overhead,” he said. “We’ve seen this story before in other industries: large-capital backed miners will benefit at the expense of smaller players.”  Large companies may not be completely spared either, however, if they are required to include independent assurance of their Scope 3 emission disclosures, Bradford said, noting that “if this portion does pass, I would expect a fairly long adoption period being added to a final rule.”  Either way, Bradford said he expects CleanSpark will not be impacted significantly by the proposed new rules. “At CleanSpark, we are always aiming to be ahead of the regulatory environment so we anticipate a minimal impact to our reporting and operational efforts should any of these rules be adopted,” Bradford said.

In fact, a fourth-quarter survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council estimated that bitcoin miners globally are now utilizing a 58.5% mix of sustainable energy for their mining operations, up one percentage point from the third quarter.  The SEC’s proposed new regulation could raise the adoption of more sustainable energy sources for crypto miners even further. “By asking public companies to report their carbon footprint, I think, it only pushes people towards more use of renewable energy, which only helps the deployment of renewable energy and speeds our transition from legacy fuel types to renewables,” Marathon’s Thiel said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/23/mining-industry-not-that-worried-by-secs-proposed-new-climate-reporting-rules,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42395729,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASz8Ia,1648056994,PUBG Publisher Krafton Partners With Solana Labs,"Video game developer Krafton announced a partnership with Solana Labs on Wednesday that could bring non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to its popular battle-royale game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG).  South Korea-based Krafton said its plans for the Solana Labs partnership include the “development and operation of blockchain and NFT-based games and services,” according to a press release.  A source familiar with the deal told CoinDesk the partnership is a memorandum of understanding, meaning Krafton can still pull the plug on the partnership without legal repercussions.  PUBG is one of the all-time top downloaded games on the Steam platform, with an active user base in the tens of millions; it was reported to have as many as 696,000 active users playing concurrently in early 2022. The game is second in popularity in the battle-royale genre only to Epic Games' Fortnite.  “Krafton will continuously see ways to work closely with blockchain companies like Solana Labs as we work toward establishing our Web 3 ecosystem,” HyungChul Park, lead of Krafton’s Web 3 division, said in the press release. “Solana represents the best of the Web 3.0 ecosystem and its technologies. Through this cooperation, Krafton will acquire the insight needed to accelerate its investment in and output of blockchain-based experiences.”  The announcement comes as attitudes toward NFT adoption in the traditional gaming sector remain tepid, stemming from recent instances of backlash to the technology.  In February, Krafton invested $6.6 million in a pair of Korean-based NFT startups to help build out its budding Web 3 operations.

42411479,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glONfN,1648056990,"Ray Dalio, Sigma Males and the New Grindset","Early this week my colleague Danny Nelson reported that billionaire investor and author Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater hedge fund, one of the largest and most influential capital managers in the world, may be gaining exposure to crypto. This is a significant advance on one of the “narratives” that many industry commentators think will lead to the “mass adoption” of crypto assets: Institutions will lead the way.  Essentially, ever since crypto was first created (god bless you, Mr. or Ms. Nakamoto), people have said that “the institutions are coming,” and that the influx of capital from banks, money managers and the like will send token prices skyward. Indeed, this hypothesis was in part proven true over the course of the coronavirus pandemic: Publicly traded corporations began putting bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheets, banks started offering crypto exposure to clients and so on – and crypto prices moved up and to the right on the charts.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  CoinDesk podcaster Nathaniel Whittemore recently offered a different, compelling take: Institutional adoption is already here, and Bridgewater’s unconfirmed exposure simply represents this new “post-narrative institutionalization.” “What I mean by that is that this institutional entry into the market – TradFi coming in – is no longer the narrative driving crypto markets. It's simply a fact of reality,” Whittemore said.  I largely agree with Whittemore that we’re in a new growth cycle of crypto adoption. It’s just a matter of fact that big banks, nation-states and the billionaire class are getting clearer on the basics and potential benefits of crypto, and in some cases embracing it. But I’d offer a caveat to this thesis. “Mass adoption” is hardly assured, and crypto will likely remain a fringe asset class. In fact, that might be better for all involved.  Crypto is a set of protocols, tools and assets that allow for social, monetary and infrastructural networks to route around “middlemen.” Bitcoin allows the transfer of a novel type of digital currency to be sent peer-to-peer. Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains allow developers to write apps that run any number of computer programs.  If done correctly, blockchains offer particular benefits over traditional financial and internet architectures; namely, if they are decentralized, the flow of money and information is resistant to tampering (read: censorship). They are further, theoretically, accessible to anyone, run all-day and may even provide the possibility of pseudonymity. (Though, there are serious challenges there.)  None of those attributes are absolutely necessary for financial or data systems to run effectively. And they come with trade-offs, like limited transaction throughput and steep energy bills. In wider society, many still look at crypto as an experiment, and an increasing number of people are skeptical of the industry’s claims or even the need for token-based markets at all.  See also: LimeWire and the Zombie Brands Pivot to Crypto  In short, there’s a conflict between whether crypto is this world-historical vehicle for techno-economico change across industries – (everywhere there’s market inefficiencies, a token could thrive) – and crypto’s position as a marginal asset class. We still don’t know where it’ll all land. But one thing is sure, crypto is thriving on the fringe.  Sigma male grindset  It’s not a stretch of the imagination to say that people, especially those who spend a lot of time online, gravitate towards group identification. We all like to signal our relationship to certain causes or identities. (See the perennially popular Buzzfeed lists, the quick adoption of neologisms like “wordcels” or “shape rotators,” niche subreddits.)  “Sigma male” is one of the newer ways for people to self-identify. It’s a term that supposedly, somewhat-ironically, describes people that “operate outside of social systems and hierarchies,” according to Dazed. They’re the lone wolves of the world. They’re motivated by internal desires, rather than social acceptance. They’ve always existed, but some of the clearest examples come from the social media age.  Serial investor Gary Vaynerchuk is perhaps the archetypical “sigma male.” He cosigns a worldview where friends, family and personal enrichment ought to be sidelined for a singular pursuit of profit and success. His life’s desire, reportedly, is to own the New York Jets U.S. professional football team. He has a unique ability to “translate the strange, technical language of finance and investing into something that is accessible and entertaining,” which has won him the appraisal of many Gen Z social media users.  The “self-made” soprano with a penchant for cursing represents a real trend of people that “rise and grind,” or put all of their energy into work. They’re the type of social-media investor that might recommend putting you “entire pension … into this three-times levered zinc-futures ETF today,” as Bloomberg columnist Paul J. Davies wrote.  Lately, crypto has become a key component of this “grindset.” It offers a risky way for people to build “generational wealth,” and rewards those who do their “own research.” Of course, Vaynerchuk is big on crypto – particularly NFTs (or non-fungible tokens that add a price and a way to track pieces of digital media). He’s called CryptoPunks the “next Facebook,” a company in which he was early to invest.  I’m just scratching the surface here on the “sigma male grindset.” One particular trend seems to capture its perils best, that memes of Patrick Bateman, the archetypical fictionalized portrait of 1980s greed and vanity in “American Psycho,” have been recuperated as a positive example of what grinding can bring. Apparently, zoomers aren’t “in on the joke,” but they’re also pretty hard to read.  There are many things that separate Dalio from Vaynerchuk. They operate in different leagues. Vaynerchuk appeals to retail investors while Dalio deals with mega-corps and nation-states. They’re focused on different levers of socio-economic change: Vaynerchuk sees the internet as the prime mover reshaping the world while Dalio looks to oil and greenbacks.  Dalio runs a hedge fund with a product called “Pure Alpha”(referring to “alpha,” or the rate of return you can earn above normal markets), but the man is pure “sigma.” He advocates for consistent self-improvement, for a rational outlook on reality and has implemented procedures at Bridgewater where all meetings are filmed to be reviewed and notated on later. Although there is a Bridgewater c-suite, with Dalio at top, all employees are encouraged to second-guess and pushback on their superiors and inferiors work.  Last year, I wrote about “Wall Street’s oddest duck” ahead of his keynote speech at Consensus (buy tickets for this year’s festival in Austin, by the way), where I noted that his theory about the “changing world order” aligns pretty well with bitcoiners. At that conference he announced he preferred bitcoin over “bonds.”  And now, it appears, he’s steering his company to examine crypto more closely. Bridgewater might be said to be moving slowly here – as mentioned, many hedge funds have already allocated to bitcoin. So is the latest news an indication of the “post-narrative institutionalization” of crypto? Or just the latest example of crypto thriving on the sidelines?

42395721,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASz8Ai,1648056787,India’s Crypto Industry Fears Proposed Tax Rules Will Increase ‘Brain Drain’,"India's crypto entrepreneurs have long sought to set up shop outside the nation's borders, citing a hostile response to the industry from regulators.  The nation's new proposed tax law – which would impose a staggering 30% capital gains tax and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS), coupled with an ongoing lack of clear regulation for crypto companies – may exacerbate this brain drain.  Industry participants have little hope that the current administration, headed up by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will have a change of heart before the legislation is formally introduced into parliament this week.  CoinDesk has reported that industry participants now only have hope that the government may reduce the 1% TDS, but the capital gains tax will remain as is. If the government does not ease the taxation burden, the industry has mulled challenging the law in the Supreme Court of India.  Should India proceed with implementing its tax bill in its current form, industry advocates fear developers and startup founders will launch their products in friendlier jurisdictions, which would result in an acceleration of crypto brain drain from India – a potentially irreversible human resource and financial loss for the nation.  India’s brain drain  Earlier this month, Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of one of India's most famous crypto firms, the layer 2 protocol Polygon, said “the brain drain is absolutely crazy.” Nailwal is based in Dubai, rather than India.  Brain drain includes both entrepreneurs setting up shop outside of the country, and to a much greater extent, Indian developers joining companies based in crypto-friendly nations.  Although there is little data or research to support the brain drain theory, the trend is apparent to industry executives.  Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO of Unocoin, a prominent Indian crypto exchange, said that although there is no data to support brain drain, the issue is real.  “More than half of the Indians into crypto have settled in Dubai. From my nine years in the business, depending on the number of founders, HNIs, customers and how big the industry is my educated guess would be 30,000 people. Maybe two-thirds would be high-net-worth individuals and the remaining would be crypto professionals who have tried to become entrepreneurs there,” Viswanath said.  Unocoin’s parent company was registered in Singapore in 2013. Since then, Viswanath claims to have met more than 200 Indian entrepreneurs in crypto.  “Not even 10 said they would register their companies in India. The entire ecosystem is moving. Forget about developers or traders, even marketeers,” Viswanath said.  An external government policy adviser, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak with the press, said that “it appears that the industry has taken a position to collectively promote the narrative that India is going through a brain drain.”  A top industry executive, who was not authorized to comment on the record, denied allegations of a collective or coordinated campaign. Rather he said that the narrative is simple “unilateral messaging by exchanges and crypto-related companies” to reassert the “genuine nature of India’s brain drain.”  The policy expert said they heard anecdotal evidence of brain drain “particularly to countries like the UAE and Singapore as those are destinations that Indians are familiar with and are hospitable to entrepreneurs.”  The policy expert argued that the “exodus” is similar to the brain drain in India’s IT industry, which has witnessed this phenomenon for 30 years. The reason for the exodus is simple: The work culture in other countries is “more mobile (work from home is new to us but not to most IT entrepreneurs) and more sensitive to their operational environments,” the individual said.  The policy expert said “IT professionals are easy to lose when they feel uncomfortable or unwelcome,” but the concern here is that “India is getting left behind in the crypto race too after falling behind in the internet age.”  Back then India’s slow adoption resulted in tech talent leaving the nation. A lack of support for tech innovation failed to attract significant foreign and domestic investment in technology.  A survey by the World Economic Forum revealed that more than 80% of senior executives from Indian companies believe that ""policy-makers were behind the curve in terms of the laws they passed relating to technology and innovation”.  Unocoin’s Viswanath said that the crypto brain drain is different from India’s IT “exodus” because “this is new, salaries are 20% to 30% higher, and the growth rate for companies is exponentially higher.”  “Here the industry is fast-paced. Companies that were born two or three years ago are now unicorns. Their market capitalization is close to $10 billion. That kind of value creation is not possible in such a short period of time in other industries yet. This is about money and everyone wants in,” Viswanath said.  Another major Indian exchange, BuyUCoin is one of the few to be registered in India. Its approach was to build a platform by Indians for Indians, said Shivam Thakral, its CEO. Today, the leadership of BuyUCoin feels confused about its approach.  Thakral said young blockchain developers are in “high demand across the globe,” and if India does not provide a promising career path “they will be poached by foreign companies easily” resulting in the “biggest brain drain India has ever witnessed.”  “More than 30 of our engineers have left to work in countries like Dubai, San Francisco and Singapore due to the ambiguity around the crypto sector in India,” Thakral said.  According to Siddharth Sogani, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency research organization Crebaco, “developers are getting paid up to $150,000 abroad and in India, there is no respect for their talent.” “India will see the biggest brain drain in history in the next 8 to 12 months. Making #crypto difficult is not going to stop innovation. The smarties will move offshore! And you know what, these smarties will make billion-dollar enterprises in the crypto space!,” Sogani later said in a tweet.  CoinDesk spoke to more than 20 startup founders who echoed Sogani's comments, saying it is clear that India's crypto developers are seeking friendlier grounds.  Sogani explained that most of the well-known crypto companies in India, barring a few, have “holding companies abroad in crypto-friendly countries like Singapore where regulation is clear.”“A large chunk of foreign institutional investors, who were otherwise bullish on the India crypto story, have indefinitely postponed their plans to invest in India because of the regulatory uncertainty and unrealistic proposed tax laws,” BuyUCoin’s Thakral said.  Negotiation battlefield  A few days after Feb. 1, when India announced the tax proposals for cryptocurrencies (referred to as virtual digital assets or VDAs in the legislation), government officials opened their doors to gather information and “feedback.” These meetings happened both informally and formally but remained unpublicized by both the industry and government.  Industry participants expressed concern that the new tax proposals would scuttle the potential of India’s burgeoning industry. The industry’s argument is that such rules would add to a perception that India is not a crypto-friendly place and as a result, the ongoing “exodus” of crypto industry and talent would be exacerbated.  ​​The government expressed surprise at the rationale behind the claims that the 1% TDS was impractical, government officials not authorized to speak on the record told CoinDesk. They were also reluctant to believe that there was a crypto industry exodus.  These meetings have slowed down over the past two weeks. A top executive at a major Indian exchange, who requested anonymity to speak frankly about industry-regulator relations, said this “does not bode well” for the industry.  Activists have been trying to gauge public sentiment around the crypto taxes.  A change.org petition started by Aditya Singh, co-founder of Crypto India, urging “the government to reconsider & reduce crypto tax” has garnered over 100,000 signatures. “New crypto tax rules are too harsh & will hurt the entire industry if they are not changed. This will result in Brain Drain, kill trading, mining, and on top of that will create a lot of confusion. Only a few days remain before it becomes applicable. Urging the government to reconsider & reduce crypto tax,” Singh tweeted.  “I know of more than five major crypto projects that were founded in India but are now shifting or have already shifted abroad,” Singh told CoinDesk.  Reasons behind ‘exodus’  Coupled with the impending tax bill, another reason behind the exodus is a lack of clarity around how crypto companies are to be regulated.  It’s unclear whether crypto tokens amount to goods under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), or how founders can launch businesses without policies governing their operations.  The second is compliance. Legal interpretations in the absence of any crypto-specific law give a disproportionate advantage to law enforcement authorities. Investigations and settlements can take up to five or six years. A slow and unfriendly crypto regulatory environment produces chartered accountants with inadequate backgrounds in blockchain and Web 3 and that is dangerous, according to an industry source who requested anonymity for fear of retribution from law enforcement. The third factor contributing to the exodus is external forward thinkers – crypto-friendly nations beating India and “whales,” or large crypto investors, happy to set up shop outside India. Both the nations and whales have incentivized opportunities through ease of doing business, speed and monetary compensation for developers and crypto entrepreneurs. Industry executives said it is cheaper to hire blockchain developers from India. They see Indian-founded Web 3 firms using India-based talent and offices, but these companies are registered in other countries due to better compliance clarity and investment opportunities. This is a loss of foreign direct investment to India.  According to insiders, the industry to some extent understands the government’s desire to seek global consensus and wider consultations before coming up with regulations.  What new founders want  Ashish Anand is a chartered accountant and the co-founder and CEO of Bru Finance, a platform that makes non-fungible tokens (NFTs) out of real-world assets and uses those NFTs as collateral for loans.  He chose to register Bru Finance, a public decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchain firm in the Caribbean islands. Anand says he set up shop abroad because India has no clear regulation, high taxes and NFTs are not clearly defined.  “We don’t want gray areas. TDS (tax deducted at source) should be removed. Instead, like the equity market, we may have something on the lines of securities transaction tax (STT). And TDS is not revenue for the government, STT is,” Anand said.  Bengaluru, India-based Nilesh Lalwani, who is setting up a Web 3 shopping platform in which shoppers can earn cryptocurrencies as cash back, is planning to register the venture in the British Virgin Islands, in the U.S. in Wyoming or in Dubai.  “India’s crypto policies are a long way to go and that’s why 99% of the companies launching tokens here have not registered the companies in India,” Lalwani said.  Lalwani, a professional with a digital payments background, said that before deciding on entering the crypto world he “spoke to at least 15 or 20 founders, and all said that you need an offshore entity.” Most of them registered in Singapore and Dubai.  Lalwani wants India to “adopt a model like Dubai, take proactive steps to understand how it is working on becoming a worldwide hub of crypto, and understand that Web 3 is the future.”  Girish Ahirwar, co-founder and managing director of Create Protocol, a multichain protocol for creators, set up shop in Dubai.  Speaking from a blockchain conference in Dubai where a month-long crypto-related conference is taking place, Ahirwar said in the past few months he has met more than a hundred Indian origin crypto founders and developers who have all left India.  “I talked to several lawyers. They were uncertain about the legalities and so they suggested moving out. If I have to play big I have to move out. It’s a long game since this tech is here to stay and will bring a paradigm shift in how the world will work,” Ahirwar said.  Vikas Ahuja, CEO at CrossTower India, is optimistic. He believes the exodus is short-term and the nation's talent pool is big enough to turn things around once clear regulation comes through.  “For short-term investors who are into day trading, margin trading, arbitrage trading, the 1% TDS becomes infeasible. The majority of the population is still waiting on the fence, once we see the bill then we should see exponential growth. India is very rich in talent. Most tech-savvy people are here. So, if India gets the right crypto framework, it can be the next Silicon Valley,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/23/indias-crypto-industry-fears-proposed-tax-rules-will-increase-brain-drain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b10323559c0ac06320c3ae569e11184b238630c9-509x339.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395734,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASz8PT,1648056370,MiCA Could Still Be Delayed by EU Parliamentarians Over Proof-of-Work Provision,"The next 24 hours may be critical for crypto enthusiasts in the European Union (EU) as lawmakers negotiate a mandate for the proposed landmark legislation for digital assets before it moves on to the next phase of discussions.  UPDATE (March 25th, 11:36 UTC): EU's MiCA Bill Moves Forward Without Bitcoin Limiting Provision  European parliamentarians that have been calling for measures aimed at restricting the use of cryptocurrencies that rely on the energy-intensive computing process called proof-of-work in the EU could still stall the proposed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, the EU’s sweeping regulatory package for cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, EU legislators are also split on which agency should enforce MiCA.  EU parliamentarian Stefan Berger, who is tasked with overseeing MiCA through the EU’s legislative process, tweeted on Tuesday that the MiCA negotiating mandate for the upcoming trilogue (three-way discussions between the EU parliament, commission and council) “can be challenged if a tenth of the MEPs (71 votes) are in favor.”  The deadline to decide is Wednesday, Berger said, adding that, if these votes come together, the entire parliament would have to vote on it in April.  “I hope it does not go to plenary. I don’t know. To be honest, I don’t know. Let’s see. This is politics,” said Berger during an interview with CoinDesk on Wednesday.  Berger fears that if the legislation does go to a plenary session, some parliamentarians may make one last attempt to stop the MiCA draft in its current form, which does not include the provision to ban proof-of-work.  Last week, relief swept through the European Union’s (EU) crypto community after a MiCA draft shed a divisive provision that could have effectively banned bitcoin (BTC) over energy concerns as it passed through a parliamentary committee vote last week.  “I am more than relieved that the [committee] voted against the ban of proof-of-work-based assets for EU companies in the end,” said Patrick Hansen, head of strategy at Unstoppable Finance and an outspoken critic of the political movement targeted at limiting proof-of-work cryptocurrencies in the EU.  Crypto advocates, including Hansen, pointed out that although there are plans to move Ethereum to proof-of-stake, a consensus mechanism that is less energy-intensive, Bitcoin may not have the same option. Critics of the proposed provision also said that suggesting Bitcoin could be transitioned out of proof-of-work may have revealed how little lawmakers understand blockchain.  “While action against climate change is important, the solution to ban proof-of-work in the EU is misguided. It shows that the blockchain community must engage with lawmakers and educate them to make informed decisions, which are based on facts and not guided by political considerations,” said Benedikt Faupel, blockchain project manager at Bitkom, Germany’s digital industry association, in an email to CoinDesk.  Faupel added that it’s unlikely that the scrapped proof-of-work provision will find its way back into MiCA. But that doesn’t mean it’s completely out of the picture, he said.  Hansen said that there is a good chance that parliamentarians in favor of the provision would take it up with the parliament once again.  Meanwhile, although the controversial provision was essentially scrapped after last Monday’s vote, it was discarded in favor of an alternative measure that would require the European Commission, the government arm in charge of proposing new legislation in the EU, to come up with a proposal to be included in the EU taxonomy on “any crypto-asset mining activities that contribute substantially to climate change” by 2025.  “The EU taxonomy classifies economic activities according to their environmental sustainability. Thereby, states, companies and investors shall be enabled to be direct investments to sustainable economic activities in line with the European Green Deal,” Faupel said, adding that classifying proof-of-work as unsustainable under the taxonomy would make it harder for proof-of-work mining companies to attract capital.  “But it would only marginally affect other crypto businesses like exchanges,” Faupel said.  In the days following the vote, EU committee members on opposite sides of the aisle began sparring on Twitter over the result of the vote.  “We narrowly lost the vote, but the debate on this continues. Clear ecological criteria will come sooner or later & then cryptocurrencies that optimize their energy consumption will prevail. Others will disappear,” said EU parliamentarian Rasmus Andresen, who supported the provision that would require cryptocurrencies to meet climate standards in the EU on Twitter.  While Andresen said it was “absurd” that Green and Left parliamentarians pushing for this provision wanted to ban cryptocurrencies that use renewable energy, Berger, who proposed the alternative compromise that ended up winning the majority vote last week, fired back saying Andresen’s reasoning was “a clear attempt to conceal the potential for harm of one’s own proposal.”  Berger added that the ecological criteria crypto assets would have had to meet under the scrapped provision were indeed linked to a requirement to phase out of proof-of-work and amounted to “a de facto PoW ban.”  “There’s never a dull moment in this nascent industry. Although the proof-of-work amendment, which would have meant a de facto EU ban on Bitcoin and Ethereum, was voted down, the sigh of relief we are breathing is likely short-lived,” said Ian Taylor, executive director at CryptoUK, an independent industry association, in a statement.  In the same statement, Taylor said it was very concerning for the industry that 23 members of the EU’s economic and monetary committee voted in favor of a de facto bitcoin ban.  Hansen said that that amendment would have had dramatic consequences on the European crypto market, since it would have pushed EU consumers towards foreign, unregulated exchanges and taken European companies, capital and talent out of the EU.  “Even if, in all likelihood, that amendment would not have found its way into the final agreement, the mere symbol of the EU Parliament calling for a [proof-of-work] ban would already have had detrimental effects on the market,” Hansen said.  Berger said that the European council and commission have other areas to focus on during the upcoming trilogue, and that the commission has no intention of banning any crypto.  Enforcing MiCA  A key discussion point during the trilogue will be about which EU regulators will have the power to supervise the EU crypto space under MiCA.  According to Berger, the council and the parliament will have to reach a compromise on which regulator – the European Banking Authority (EBA) or the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) – will have more supervision power.  Another problem is deciding how to authorize coins, Berger said. MiCA was drafted in the wake of the now-defunct Diem, Facebook’s infamous stablecoin project.  “The European Central Bank must have a binding opinion when a coin is authorized,” Berger said.  European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde has, in the meantime, been calling for MiCA to be finalized and enforced with urgency in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and concerns that sanctioned entities in Russia might use crypto to evade restrictions.  Berger said it will take at least a year to implement MiCA.  “When we finish the trilogue and MICA comes into reality, we will need about one year so it is not the case that we bring MiCA to answer the Russia and Ukraine conflict, but the very important thing is that we raise a signal with MiCA that we want to create a supervision architecture,” Berger said.  The MiCA trilogue is expected to begin next week, Berger said.

Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, agreed that regulators have to “quickly” get a handle on DeFi and the sector’s growth.  ""We have to do it together, internationally. Because if we try to do it within our own locations, we're going to fail because it will escape us and… it'll always be somewhere else,” Bailey said at the summit.  The U.K. had $170 billion in value received from DeFi protocols between June 2020 and July 2021, the most in Europe at the time, according to a Chainalysis report.  Central bank digital currencies  The Fed is sharing its analysis on central bank digital currencies (CBDC) with six other central banks at the BIS, Powell said. Their discussions will cover the whole digital landscape including stablecoins, crypto assets and financial innovation.  “We are dedicated to working with our domestic and international colleagues on making sure that the payment and monetary systems evolve in a responsible way that brings about improvements while also maintaining safety, soundness and financial stability,” Powell said.  The Fed released its long-awaited white paper on central bank digital currencies in January, but did not commit to creating a digital dollar. The white paper stated any CBDC should ensure privacy, be an intermediary with the private sector, be transferable and adhere to rules on money laundering and financing terrorism.  Meanwhile, private parties in the U.K. launched the Digital Pound Foundation, an organization that aims to promote the development of a CBDC in the country in October.  Around the world  The Fed is actively engaged with other central banks and international partners in moving the Group of 20 (G20) nations’ cross-border roadmap forward. Powell added the roadmap carries the potential to address the frictions in international payments for G20.  The BIS Innovation Hub, along with central banks in Australia, South Africa, Singapore and Malaysia, concluded their ongoing experiment with a multi-CBDC platform, dubbed Project Dunbar, on Tuesday. The researchers found their prototype platform for settling state-backed virtual assets was ""technically viable.""  Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said it was urgent for the bank to complete its digital euro work. The ECB is on track to finish its digital euro project in two years.

42417126,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSJwNx,1648054924,The Rise of Illegal Crypto Mining Hijackers – And Big Tech’s Response,"Big tech firms like Google and Amazon are on high alert about cryptojacking threats to their cloud servers. As this type of attack grows more prevalent, consumer awareness remains the key to cyber defense, experts say.  Cryptojacking is a type of cyber attack whereby hackers hijack a computer’s resources and use them to mine cryptocurrencies. The most popular coin mined this way is the privacy coin monero (XMR), which is widely used throughout the dark web.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Mining Week series.  The cloud-services providers are essentially renting out apartment buildings to their users, said Wei Xian Tee, Cybercrime Specialized Officer at Interpol. They have limited visibility into what users are doing, and if they peek inside those apartments, privacy issues arise. Hence, there isn’t much that cloud providers can do to prevent users from downloading cryptojacking malware that infects their computers. Instead, when it comes to cryptojacking, Interpol's top priority is to educate the public about the threats this kind of malware poses, so that users can alert authorities, he said.  Read more: What Is Cryptojacking?  Cloud services pool hardware resources, offering them as virtualized on-demand services to paying subscribers. Often taking up city blocks' worth of data center space, these powerful, globally distributed systems are a juicy target for cryptojackers. By hacking into one virtual machine, they can gain access to vastly larger hardware resource pools on these virtualized environments.  Most companies and individuals rely on cloud vendors, such as Google or Amazon, to store data and run applications. When they use these services, they create their own virtual machines on the vendor’s cloud, and share them with staff, who in turn connect them with different devices. This process opens up several attack vectors for the cryptojacker to gain access to a company’s virtual machines, and perhaps ultimately, the vast server resources of the cloud vendor, which can include GPU farms often used by enterprises to train artificial intelligence systems.  The growing threat of cryptojacking  Cybersecurity firm SonicWall estimates that the amount of all cryptojacking attacks grew 19% year over year in 2021, with the bulk of the increase coming from Europe.  In its 2021 cybersecurity report, Google Cloud said that 86% of compromised cloud instances were used for crypto mining.  “As cryptocurrency grows in value, some attackers are turning to cryptojacking over ransomware,” Karthik Selvaraj, security research director at Microsoft, told CoinDesk. “Cryptocurrency is here to stay, which unfortunately means crypto thieves are too,” he said.  Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky’s general manager for Southeast Asia, Yeo Siang Tiong, pointed out that as bitcoin prices soared in September 2021, the number of users encountering crypto mining threats reached 150,000 – its highest monthly level. The Russian cybersecurity firm also noted data last year indicating that hackers have diverted resources away from traditional cyberattacks like distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) to cryptojacking.  The switch to proof-of-stake mining could help curb the growth of cryptojacking, as it would render this type of attack less profitable, Microsoft’s Selvaraj said.  Big Tech fights back  “Microsoft and Intel recently partnered to improve Microsoft Defender for Endpoint’s ability to detect cryptocurrency mining malware,” said Selvaraj. Microsoft uses behavioral and memory scanning technology to “detect both cryptojacking and Infostealers that target wallets,” the security director said.  Endpoint security protects a network, say a corporate cloud network, by securing the devices that connect to it from outside its firewall. These endpoint devices are those that humans, for example a firm’s employees, interface with, like laptops, tablets, etc.  Earlier in February, Google Cloud launched a new product, dubbed Virtual Machine Threat Detection (VMTD), aimed at protecting clients from cryptojacking threats. Google Cloud declined to comment on this story and pointed CoinDesk to the blog post announcing their VMTD.  Read More: Don’t Call It a Comeback: The Unlikely Rise of Home Bitcoin Mining  Unlike Microsoft, Google Cloud’s security solution aims to detect crypto mining malware running in virtual machines by looking at the hypervisor, the software that creates and runs the virtual machines. This method will soften the performance blow compared to traditional endpoint security, the firm said.  “Truthfully no single vendor approach will be sufficient,"" John Wethington, a cybersecurity expert and whitehat hacker, told CoinDesk. “While you can argue the merits or pros and cons of a specific vendor’s approach it's important to note that those decisions are often made in a vacuum of information by a handful of people, not a single individual,” he said.  Amazon Web Services (AWS), the online retailer’s cloud service provider, refused to comment on this story. A spokesperson said that it is a “credit card/identity fraud issue.” According to cybersecurity firm Cado, AWS was the victim of a crypto mining attack in August 2020. A group known as TeamTNT successfully stole AWS credentials and deployed XMRig, the most common cryptojacking malware, to servers, the firm said at the time.  Alibaba Cloud was also the target of a cryptojacking attack in November 2021, according to research from Trend Micro. A representative from Alibaba Cloud directed CoinDesk to a webpage about their anti-ransomware capabilities and said the firm would not comment at this time.  Cryptojackers: Hidden in plain sight  Unlike other attacks, crypto miners flourish by being stealthy over long periods of time, so that they can mine as much cryptocurrency as possible, Yeo said.  For this reason, “the Golden rule of thumb in this space is not to make a lot of noise,” according to Wethington.  Cryptojackers will “hijack enough devices so that their processing power can be pooled” to create a large cryptojacking network that is more effective in generating income, said Kaspersky’s Yeo. This leads to a “sudden slowing of devices or a rise in cross-company complaints about computer performance,” he said.  However, hackers will often opt for a quiet modus operandi: a distributed low impact botnet of XMRig miners, which are easy to deploy and, “unless something is horribly wrong with the configuration,” cloud customers won’t notice, Wethington said. These attacks are typically run by cryptojacking crews instead of being offered as a service, he said.  On top of the hackers’ cunning methods, users might just think that their computer is getting old and slow when, in fact, hackers are using their resources to mine cryptocurrencies, Interpol’s Tee explained.  Often the malware resides in compromised versions of legitimate software, such that “security scans are less likely to flag the downloaded application as a threat,” Yeo said.  More broadly, organizations are struggling with “multiple cloud providers, non-standard security controls, and a lack of visibility into what is occurring inside of their environment,” VMware’s principal cybersecurity strategist, Rick McElroy, told CoinDesk via email.  Many of the vulnerabilities exploited for cryptojacking are the same as those used in other types of cyber offensive operations, Tee pointed out.  The growing sophistication of cryptojackers  In its cybersecurity report, Google Cloud said 58% of attacked cloud instances had the malware downloaded within 22 seconds of the initial compromise, indicating the hackers used automated tools.  McElroy pointed to an attack on a Kubernetes environment. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications that has been increasingly popular among tech firms like Spotify and Booking.com.  Read More: Why Some Bitcoin Devs Say Lasers Can Cut Mining’s Energy Costs  Kubernetes options are available on cloud services like AWS and Google, along with their own cloud management software, but the container system can also be configured and deployed independently of providers.  Graboid, a type of worm malware, specifically targeted so-called containers, akin to virtual machines but running on Kubernetes. This shows the innovation of cryptojacking cybercriminals, as well as their improved understanding of the lack of defensive tools protecting Kubernetes environments, said McElroy.  The complexity and sophistication of threats has grown in recent years, said Kaspersky’s Yeo. “The number of unique modifications have also increased by 47% in Q3 2021 in comparison to Q2 2021,” he said. Modifications are changes to the code of a crypto mining application to mine a new token or adapt to new systems.  Interpol’s Tee said cryptojacking attacks are still not as sophisticated as other types of cyberattacks. Crypto-mining scripts can be bought online for as little as $30, research from threat intelligence firm Digital Shadows showed in 2018.  A cryptojacker’s attack methods  The most popular method of attack is phishing, said McElroy. In 2021, SonicWall observed cryptojacking also spreading through pirated and cracked software.  “Systems that aren’t patched or have configuration issues that are public facing, such as websites or email servers, still remain at the top of the list as well,” he said. Hackers have been known to scan networks for unprotected endpoints; these can be anything from laptops, to virtual machines on cloud servers, to the Internet of Things (IoT) devices like your smart fridge.  In 2019, Interpol found more than 20,000 routers were affected by illegal crypto mining malware. Operation Goldfish, as it was called, took five months and involved law enforcement authorities from 10 Southeast Asian countries. Through these routers, the hackers were able to infect machines, and the mining software was actually running on the background of browsers, Tee said.  “We will start to see a number of edge computing devices used for this purpose,"" McElroy said, adding that he sees attackers going after soft targets, such as IoT devices. These generally lack “prevention, detection and response capabilities as organizations have prioritized driving up security and visibility inside of cloud environments,” he noted.  The more cryptojackers turn to the growing attack surface offered by IoT devices, the more consumers will have to be aware of the threat to protect themselves.  “To protect against cryptojacking attacks specifically, it’s also necessary to monitor processor usage across all endpoints, including those hosted in the cloud,” Kaspersky’s Yeo said.

The Sports Metaverse will allow users to trade NFTs, buy and develop land and visit stadiums. The London-based company is developing games where users can earn its native token, ICONS, a representative said.  Ownership of the NFTs can also include a masterclass from sporting figures, according to a press release.  “In The Sports Metaverse, I’m going to coach you on how I take a penalty – one of the hardest moments in my job,” Romelu Lukaku, a striker with English Premier League soccer club Chelsea, said in the statement.  Sports players and brands have been considering the metaverse – a conceptualized virtual world – as a way to expand their reach. Adidas teased in November about forming a partnership with The Sandbox metaverse, and in December, Nike purchased an NFT fashion collectibles startup called RTFKT that can be worn in the virtual world.  Manchester City, the 2021 Premier League champion, said in December it was teaming up with Sony to launch a metaverse that replicates its Etihad stadium. It will feature online experiences, customizable avatars and interactive loyalty programs.  SportIcon is in talks to expand the soccer, tennis, mixed martial arts, basketball, baseball players and brands involved.  A public land sale for the Sports Metaverse will take place in June, when the metaverse officially opens. Every person who buys land will get an interactive fan cave where they can display their NFTs, a representative from the SportsIcon team said.  SportsIcon, which is led by CEO Chris Worsey, is backed by Roham Gharegozlou, CEO of digital collectibles company Dapper Labs, Chad Hurley, the founder of YouTube, and Andrew Bogut, an ex-National Basketball Association star.

42417140,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3bx,1648052643,"Location, Location, Location: Investing in Real Estate in the Metaverse","For metaverse real estate investors, the reality that property online will appreciate more than property in the real world isn’t too hard to imagine, says Armando Aguilar, a digital asset strategist who made the decision to cash out a portion of his crypto holdings to buy a physical house in October 2019 and later bought a lot in the The Sandbox, an online platform, in spring 2021.  “My metaverse backyard is appreciating more than my real estate,” Aguilar said. “Real estate prices in the metaverse have been insane.” Since making both purchases, Aguilar says the price of his three-bedroom, two-bathroom home outside New York City has appreciated two and a half times, while his plot in The Sandbox has surged 1,400 times its original value.  What actually is virtual real estate?  If the notion of virtual land is new to you, you’re not alone. While a quick scroll through crypto Twitter makes it seem like every major company, brand and celebrity is buying up virtual property, the reality is that relatively few people are partaking in the metaverse land rush.  Yet, as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) grow in popularity, the concept of metaverse real estate doesn’t seem so far-fetched. In a recent ""New Rules of Business"" podcast produced by the professional membership network Chief, Janine Yorio, CEO of Republic Realm, a metaverse investment platform, broke down exactly what metaverse real estate investing is for those who haven’t taken the plunge:  “Metaverse real estate is an NFT,” Yorio said on the podcast. “They are a JPEG or [digital file that] points to a specific file that is logged on the blockchain, which is this ledger that tracks who owns [each asset]. Much the same way that if you bought land in a town, you'd go to the town hall and open a drawer to find your deed. Instead, you're looking at the blockchain.”  On a blockchain, you can look inside people's wallets, Yorio explained. Every transaction is also the receipt or deed in the cryptocurrency world, unlike in the real world where the two are distinct.  “In the real world, you usually own something, but then there's paperwork to back it up. In crypto, owning it is part of the transaction. And once it's in your wallet, your ownership of it is indisputable,” Yorio said.  And this indisputable ownership is appealing. Prices on digital property in metaverse worlds like The Sandbox and Decentraland rose 700% last year, and rapper Snoop Dog built an interactive metaverse (the “Snoopverse”) in which you can pay as much as you would for a physical house to be his virtual neighbor.  But does location matter just as much in the metaverse as it does in real life? Yorio argues that no, it doesn’t when you can simply click where you want to go. Property values can fluctuate based on factors we’re already used to – proximity to desirable locations, prestige, digital “curb” appeal – along with new dimensional limitations and benefits. If they seem entirely new and made up, it’s because they are.  “Bringing a big brand or big project raises the value of the land around it,” says Sam Huber, founder and CEO of the metaverse advertising agency Admix. That is a notion we can wrap our minds around.  Does location matter in the metaverse?  In a digital world in which one click can transport you from a particular neighborhood in the metaverse to another, developers are also getting creative when it comes to constructing the new limits and possibilities of virtual worlds.  “Different platforms are solving it or trying to solve it in different ways,” Huber says. “On one extreme, you have platforms where distance doesn't matter at all, which is kind of currently the case on Sandbox because you can just basically click in the area that you want to go and go there directly.”  The problem with that, Huber says, is that it becomes harder to determine value based on your proximity to, say, Snoop’s house.  “If the distance is not a problem, then technically you shouldn't have areas that are much more expensive than others because you can always get anywhere, even if it's at the edge of the map,” Huber says.  The virtual world known as Somnium Space, for example, has a teleporter just for that reason – but it comes at a cost.  “It’s the token that they have,” Huber explains. “So you can ‘walk’ [where you want to go] for free or you can skip the ‘walk’ by taking a teleporter, which is also sold as an NFT.” Some people own the teleporter and can effectively charge people to use it – a nice little side hustle.  The idea of a teleporter NFT may seem a little out there, but that’s the fun of The Sandbox, or of any metaverse. Architects, developers, coders, gamers, designers – and basically just about anyone who loves Web 3 – enjoys building in these new, digital lands because the limits of reality get to be however we define them.  “We don't want to recreate the barriers of the physical world, like distance and gravity in the digital world. We build [in the metaverse] to avoid that in the first place,” Huber says. “Some people might see it as a value add to be able to teleport,” he says, adding that others may see it as “artificial scarcity” created just to get in on the metaverse cash cow.  But the artificial scarcity of the metaverse doesn’t seem to be stopping people from joining in on the fun. The Reddit community for the Ethereum-based Decentraland metaverse has more than 85,000 members discussing topics like which luxury brands will be a part of the metaverse fashion week, how to open storefronts to sell digital wares, what’s the price of MANA – the digital currency used in the Decentraland metaverse – and more.  How to invest in metaverse real estate  When you feel ready to take the plunge and get in on the metaverse real estate game, there are a few practical steps you can follow:  Pick a metaverse to buy in and know why  According to Yorio, who wrote a guide on metaverse real estate investing earlier this year, there are two distinct ways you can look at the prospective value of your metaverse property and therefore determine which metaverse platform to go with.  First, there’s what she calls the ""Asset-Based Valuation,"" which is looking at metaverse economics similarly to how we view physical real estate. This model requires researching how much metaverse real estate sells for on different NFT marketplaces and understanding what makes property valuable in every metaverse.  For instance, casinos drive property value up in Decentraland, Yorio explains, whereas a spot near Snoop’s house in The Sandbox will be priced at a premium. You can also look at factors such as plot size, zoning requirements (e.g. how tall buildings can be) and the overall scarcity of the metaverse (if less property is available, prices will be higher).  Popular metaverse platforms like Decentraland, The Sandbox, Axie Infinity, Crypto Voxels, Somnium Space and EmberSword, among others, have all published the total number of parcels they plan to make available to purchasers. That helps with the simple supply-and-demand assessment of each metaverse, but for a deeper analysis, there’s more to consider.  Therefore, a second way to look at value is through the lens of a venture capitalist. With this strategy, it’s more important to focus on metrics such as the number of monthly users who interact in a particular metaverse, the types of companies that are building projects there and what kind of return on investment a person may get from plunking down his dollars in the early stages of what could be the next virtual hangout space or virtual gaming community. Look for three main indicators of a project’s buzz worthiness, Yorio says:  Traction  Team  Road map  How many people are talking about the prospective metaverse in the Discord messaging app, what teams are building and promoting the projects there and how solid are the plans to bring these ambitious ideas to fruition?  Yorio points to a few examples that have made considerable splashes from the lens of someone thinking like a venture capitalist. For example, Star Atlas, a metaverse that ""gamifies"" virtual real estate acquisition, details its unique marketing plans on its website. Community-building strategies include NFT posters, musical artist collaborations and tiered rewards that get people excited to join.  Other projects, like the Ethereum-based immersive platform, Wilder World, will work with influencers to achieve a similar hype-building effect. If you are buying in such spaces, it’s wise to think like a venture capitalist to decide for yourself if a project’s road map has legs.  Prepare for the costs  Whether buying metaverse property on the platform’s marketplace or on an NFT marketplace such as OpenSea or Non-fungible.com, there will likely be processing fees of between 0% and 5%, along with fluctuating gas fees for Ethereum-based projects.  If purchasing land in a metaverse that uses a type of cryptocurrency you don’t own, such as Decentraland’s MANA, you should also prepare to pay the normal transaction fees required to buy that new currency on an exchange like Coinbase, in addition to taking into account the capital gains or losses you may incur from trading one currency for another.  As for the actual price of the plots themselves, costs vary depending on each metaverse’s economics. A small parcel in Somnium Space, for instance, is going for 2.1167 ETH (about $6,362) on OpenSea at the time of this writing in March 2022. That would entitle the buyer to 2,153 square feet of virtual land, with a maximum build height of 33 feet. Meanwhile, the most expensive parcel in Decentraland was recently sold for more than $2.4 million.  Look at the price history  Thanks to blockchain’s transparent transaction history, you can make a well-informed decision when buying metaverse real estate without using a third-party real estate agent (though, yes – metaverse real estate agents are becoming a thing).  Third-party platforms such as OpenSea will more than likely show the purchase history for any parcel of land you’re eyeing. View the price history so that you can get an idea of how much the price has already appreciated or depreciated since it was listed.  Weigh the pros and cons  Just like buying a physical plot of land, you should consider the logistics of building on your plot, which would require purchasing more NFT materials and tools, along with potentially hiring developers to help you code your vision – or simply purchasing the land for its future resale value.  You can also opt to buy estates with structures built on them, such as a house or a billboard, or turn multiple parcels into estates by linking them together, which increases the value even more.  According to Yorio, there’s more value in large swaths of properties linked together, and so one strategy may be to buy more affordable plots with the intention of combining them – but of course, timing is everything here.  It’s clear that novice investors (and yes, everyone in the metaverse is basically a novice because it is so new) have cashed out big time on initial investments of less than $10,000.

42395730,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASz8LX,1648051261,"Acala, VCs Commit $250M for Polkadot DeFi Investments","Some of crypto’s leading venture firms are teaming up to fuel decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Polkadot blockchain network.  Acala (ACA), a DeFi-focused network built on Polkadot, announced Wednesday it is launching a $250 million “aUSD Ecosystem Fund” to support startups in Polkadot’s budding DeFi ecosystem. Acala says the funding will be granted out specifically to teams building use cases for the Acala dollar (aUSD) – a crypto-backed stablecoin that aims to become the backbone of DeFi on Polkadot and Kusama.  Over 30 venture firms are invested in the fund, including Hypersphere, Pantera and Jump Crypto. CoinDesk’s owner, Digital Currency Group, is also involved.  Dan Reecer, Acala’s chief growth officer, described the initiative to CoinDesk as a “group effort” among teams who want to grow Polkadot as a whole.  In addition to working with venture firms, Acala has enlisted nine of the network’s largest parachains as partners in the aUSD initiative.  “It’s a way for us to all come together around this common goal of aUSD and helping to establish this kind of foundational liquidity – this foundational kind of tool – enabling the Polkadot economy to begin to grow,” Reecer said.  Polkadot and stablecoins  Polkadot has spent the past several years building out infrastructure for a multi-chain crypto ecosystem, whereby different blockchains co-exist with one another to service different use-cases.  The Polkadot network – a so-called layer 0 blockchain – provides a foundation upon which layer 1 “parachains” like Acala can securely interoperate. Polkadot’s hub-and-spoke model aims to provide a safer alternative to the problem-prone cross-chain “bridges,” that are currently used to send and receive information between wholly independent blockchains.  Read more: Polkadot Parachains Go Live, Capping Yearslong Tech Build for Ambitious Blockchain Project  Acala, which markets itself as “The DeFi Hub of Polkadot,” was the first parachain to go live on the network. Back in February, Acala launched aUSD to serve as the default stablecoin on Polkadot and its canary network, Kusama.  Stablecoins like USDC, DAI and aUSD are tokens that employ mechanisms to keep them “pegged” to the price of some other stable asset (like the U.S. dollar).  The advent of tokens with steady prices is what has enabled DeFi protocols on other blockchains, like Ethereum, to flourish. Activities like lending and borrowing, for instance, become far easier to execute on a blockchain when users can provide less volatile assets – e.g., stablecoins – as collateral.  aUSD takes after other “crypto-backed” stablecoins like DAI by relying on over-collateralization to maintain its peg. aUSD is issued out to users in the form of an overcollateralized loan, and the amount of collateral required is automatically regulated to keep aUSD trading around $1. aUSD currently accepts collateral in the form of DOT, the native token of Polkadot, Acala’s ACA token and LDOT, a variant of DOT used for liquid staking on Acala.  Today, aUSD has a circulation of $7 million with $72 million in backing, according to Acala’s official dashboards.",POSITIVE,DOT | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | MARKET | TRADING | DAI,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/23/acala-vcs-commit-250m-for-polkadot-defi-investments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd4096dca34dab03db03f39873fa869d9f3a98b2-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390174,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bX2l07,1648047918,Why Do Old-Line Businesses Enter Crypto Mining? Simple: Fat Profits,"Margins as high as 90%? It doesn’t take a Harvard MBA to know that’s an unusually profitable business model.  Such was the allure of cryptocurrency mining, back when bitcoin and the broader digital asset market hit all-time highs last year, leading many traditional businesses to venture into the mining world in search of juicier returns.  Fast forward to 2022, when miners’ margins have shrunk to 60%-70%, yet old-line businesses continue to enter the sector, as net margins of other industries are still reeling from many macroeconomic factors, including the COVID-19-related downturn. Of course, the margins are based on where the prices of the crypto currencies are going. But for now, they remain lucrative.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week.  To take advantage of such currently profitable opportunities, some long-established companies have completely transformed themselves into digital currency miners, while others diversified their legacy business for an extra revenue stream by mining and providing mining-related services.  However, the question is whether these new entrants survive and thrive in this sector. The incumbents think it might be a stretch.  But first, let's examine how these new entrants have done so far with their new ventures.  A total transformation  One of the best examples of complete transition is Nate’s Food, which rebranded itself to NHMD Holdings by transitioning from its original product – premixed pancake and waffle batter in pressurized cans – to bitcoin mining, last year. Prior to the announcement, the company reported no sales in the fiscal quarter that ended Aug. 31, 2021. In the quarter ending Nov. 30, 2021, the company reported $21,204 in revenues from mining, perhaps a glimmer of hope. However, the company was still in the red, as its net loss for the period was $74,565.  Read More: Why Some Bitcoin Devs Say Lasers Can Cut Mining’s Energy Costs  Shares of the small company, which is traded on the over-the-counter markets, more than tripled in price last year as bitcoin rallied toward all-time highs around October and November. The shares now have pared almost all of their gains since then, along with those of other crypto miners, and NHMD now trades slightly above the levels of its pre-mining days, according to TradingView data. The company didn’t immediately reply to requests for comments.  Another example of a company completely transforming itself is the Chinese sports lottery firm 500.com, which announced early last year that it would start buying bitcoin miners and subsequently rebranded itself as BIT Mining (BTCM). The company now has 4,800 gigahash per second (GH/s) ether and 825.4 petahash per second (PH/s) bitcoin mining capacity, according to its recent earnings report. However, the stock has fallen about 88% in the last 12 months, according to TradingView data.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  And even though the examples are plenty, it would be a missed opportunity not to include Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based anti-inflammatory and antiaging formula manufacturer, Graystone Company (GYST) in this feature. The company announced last year that it would move into bitcoin mining to improve its own financial health and use mining as a “hedge” against its legacy business. The company now plans to bring in 1 EH/s of mining power by 2024 and currently has 2.1 PH/s of mining power, according to its website. Shares of Graystone have also fallen about 27% in the past year.  A sixfold rally  So, a total transformation didn’t really help the above companies, at least based on their share price performance. But what about the companies that kept their core businesses, but added mining as an extra source of income?  The strategy likely helped a Thai information technology company boost its share price more than 500% after it announced plans to diversify into bitcoin mining.  Jasmine Technology Solution, which changed its name from Jasmine Telecom System Public Company, announced its foray into crypto mining on Aug. 10, 2021. At the time, the company cited the economic uncertainty brought by a new wave of COVID-19 cases as the reason to look for new business ventures that could provide a fresh source of income for the company.  It seemed to have worked in Jasmine’s favor, as the shares are now up almost fivefold since the announcement, according to TradingView data. However, the company didn’t generate a large amount of revenue from mining, as its recent presentation shows telecom service accounted for most of its top line in the fourth quarter of 2021.  “We did not transform, but we extended our potential of competency, investment and other aspects such as space, electricity and partners relating to bitcoin mining operation,” a company spokesperson told CoinDesk.  The company saw an opportunity to grow its business into an ever-expanding digital assets market and, given it was already involved in the IT sector, delving into crypto mining came naturally, the spokesperson said. Jasmine already “had a continuous growth with high recurring income and margin” before it entered mining, the representative said.  Jasmine Technology expects that its revenue from bitcoin mining will rise gradually as it gets more mining computers. The company plans to have 500 machines by the first quarter and another 3,000 within this year, while negotiations for more mining rigs are underway. “We perceive that bitcoin mining has a shorter payback period compared to investment in technology and telecommunications infrastructure, and it is a huge market giving us an opportunity to grow further,” Jasmine’s spokesperson said.  Surviving a crypto bear market  Bitcoin mining itself is not an overly complicated industry for new entrants to break into. In fact, anyone can start mining, given lots of different options are now available in the market. However, given mining is a very volatile and cyclical business, staying profitable is the main challenge for any newcomers into the industry.  “I think there are a lot of people who are very good at identifying high-margin businesses,” said Sue Ennis, vice president of corporate development of Hut 8 (HUT), one of the oldest and largest publicly traded crypto mining companies in North America. However, neophytes don’t understand the amount of complexities, including procuring power contracts and managing supply chain constraints, that come with building and operating a crypto mining business successfully, she added.  Lot of these businesses ordered their mining equipment at high prices when bitcoin was trading around $65,000, but now that it's barely catching a bid past $45,000, “how do you protect your balance sheet?” Ennis said. These are some of the questions the new entrants have never wrestled with before, but incumbents like Hut 8 have. Having weathered bear markets is what differentiates the established miners from the new ones, Ennis concluded.  This was echoed by bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK). “There are a lot more barriers to entry than people realize when mining at an industrial scale (as opposed to home mining where barriers are coming down),” said CEO Zach Bradford, adding that it’s not as simple as just “plugging in a machine.”  Read more: What Is Cryptojacking? How to Protect Yourself Against Crypto Mining Malware  “The capital requirements are substantial, and operating requirements are considerable —both in terms of new machines, infrastructure and power,” he said. The need for technical expertise also shouldn’t be overlooked, including the need to know and understand global supply chains, electrical and mechanical systems, regulatory frameworks and many other considerations, Bradford added.  Jasmine Technology said it’s coming in with eyes wide open. “There will be more companies diversifying into mining,” said the IT company’s spokesperson, adding that in the past there had been a similar trend of firms diversifying into the clean energy businesses. However, companies that can gain an understanding of the bitcoin mining business and access to the capital markets as well as source mining machines at cheaper prices through partnerships with manufacturers like Bitmain will be able to stick around, the Jasmine rep added.  Crypto mining service providers  There are of course other ways of entering the industry than mining the digital assets directly. For example, Vancouver, British Columbia-based Top Speed Energy provides data centers powered by flared natural gas that would have otherwise burned into the atmosphere to power bitcoin mining operations for customers. The company also uses the heat generated by the mining operations to supply nearby communities.  Top Speed also expects demand for computing power to multiply as metaverse related applications ramp up, which the company plans to service as well, “In the future, the metaverse's demand for computing power will be 10 times that of the present, so in the future we will not only consider mining is such a simple service, and we are also considering the future development of our company and the ability of metaverse development,” Top Speed CEO Ronan Xu told CoinDesk.  'The time has come'  Top Speed is not unique; providing flared gas as a source of power was pioneered by Crusoe Energy and has started to become a more widely used energy source for digital asset mining. Most recently, ConocoPhillips (COP), the giant oil and gas exploration and production company, said that it was routing excess natural gas from one of its Bakken region projects in North Dakota to supply power to a bitcoin (BTC) mining operation.  Given the explosive growth in the mining sector, “the time has come” for traditional enterprises to get a piece of the action, Xu said. “The digital currency mining industry chain is exceptionally long, including upstream wafers, software services, hardware services, energy services and follow-up transaction services, as well as new custody generated by future compliance supervision,” the CEO added.  Perhaps it would better suit non-crypto native businesses to service these subsectors of the mining industry, rather than start mining digital assets themselves. Such an approach might hedge them against the industry’s ups and downs and provide indirect exposure to mining at the same time.  After all, it’s often said that during the California gold rush of the mid-19th century, the merchants selling supplies to miners typically prospered more than the miners themselves.

42394535,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBWhz,1648047715,What's the Story Behind Bored Ape Yacht Club Creator Yuga Labs?,"Before the explosion of profile picture (PFP) non-fungible tokens (NFTs), creators and developers rarely stuck around to build utilities around their collections or projects.  Instead, they typically cashed in on a particular NFT craze and then immediately set their sights on the next lucrative opportunity. That was until Yuga Labs came along. That's the company behind the $3 billion Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection.  Unlike most NFT projects before it, Yuga Labs introduced new and improved strategies for enabling engagement and building a sustainable NFT ecosystem. Part of Yuga Labs' success can be attributed to the company’s decision to build a community-focused blueprint for managing the BAYC brand.  Read more: What Is ApeCoin and Who Is Behind It?  That and many more achievements continue to put Yuga Labs at the forefront of the emerging NFT movement. In this article, we will explore the operations of Yuga Labs and highlight its products.  What is Bored Ape Yacht Club?  Yuga Labs is the creator of Bored Ape Yacht Club, a project consisting of 10,000 ape-themed NFTs with different traits and unique characteristics.  Like most PFP-based NFTs, BAYC was inspired by CryptoPunks, the first of many NFT projects looking to create a library of characters with unique traits and rarity levels. While this is a given, Yuga Labs has elevated the entire concept of PFP-based NFTs, such that owners of Bored Apes automatically become a member of an exclusive club, with perks ranging from early access to new offerings to the possibility of receiving the commercial usage right to purchased Bored Apes.  As such, it is easy to see why the prices of Bored Apes NFTs have continued to soar since they launched in April 2021.  At the time of writing, the floor price of BAYC (that is, the lowest price for a Bored Ape NFT) is $304,000, according to Coingecko. This is amazing when you consider the whole idea that birthed Yuga Labs and BAYC stemmed from the perceived tendencies of crypto participants of aping (jumping) into unproven investment opportunities and, in the process, making tons of money.  The entirety of BAYC revolves around the storyline that in the distant future, these rich but bored individuals form an exclusive club and hang out in in a bar. Each ape-themed character in the NFT collection depicts the various personalities and traits you would most likely expect from a futuristic crypto club.  It’s worth mentioning that Yuga Labs is the brainchild of two friends, Gargamel and Gordon Goner, which are both pseudonyms. Interestingly, the pair decided to maintain their anonymity until only recently when a February 2022 Buzzfeed article revealed their identities as Greg Solano and Wylie Aronow.  Both had been involved in the crypto space as ""hodlers"" and traders since 2017. They eventually discovered that the emergence of NFTs created opportunities for them to showcase their creative sides and actively contribute to the crypto movement. To materialize their goals, they enlisted two software engineers, namely Emperor Tomato Ketchup and No Sass, as part of the project’s founding team.  What are MAYC and BAKC?  Following the success of BAYC, Yuga Labs went ahead to create a template for evoking sustained euphoria and prestige among its members. In less than a year, the company has issued other NFT collections as part of its plans to reward BAYC holders. The first was the Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC), which consists of 10,000 NFTs that are a collection of unique digital dogs bred as companions to the Bored Apes and distributed to all BAYC members for free.  There is also Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), a collection of mutant, or zombified, variants of Bored Apes. Yuga Labs airdropped mutant serums to holders of the 10,000 BAYC NFTs, which they can use to mint Mutant Apes that either share some semblance with the original form or come with very rare traits.  The rarity and traits of Mutant Apes depend on the tier of serum vial used to mutate the Bored Apes. Tiers M1 and M2 serums will most likely yield Mutant Apes that share some traits with original Bored Ape NFTs. In contrast, the M3 tier creates very unique and rare Mutant Apes that are more likely to fetch a higher price.  The acquisition of CryptoPunks and Meebits  On March 11, 2022, Yuga Labs expanded its NFT ecosystem further by acquiring CryptoPunks and Meebits from Larva Labs. It will interest you to note that both collections are two of BAYC’s most prominent competitors in terms of value and following. And so, it is safe to say that this move cements Yuga Labs’ position at the top of the PFP NFT market.  With this deal, Yuga Labs now owns all IP rights, brands and copyright of the CryptoPunks and Meebits collections along with 1,711 Meebits NFTs and 423 CryptoPunks.  How does Yuga Labs operate?  As mentioned earlier, Yuga Labs focuses on creating a community-focused business that looks to create more utilities for NFT holders. For the team, the goal is to keep pushing the boundaries of what an NFT ecosystem can become, which is why their products and services are strategically designed to build and preserve the exclusivity of the BAYC community.  Some of the features and services put in place by Yuga Labs are:  Holders are offered commercial rights over their NFTs, including Bored Apes, Mutant Apes, Bored Ape Kennel Club, CryptoPunks and Meebits. As such, members can create merchandise and leverage other means of monetizing their NFTs.  BAYC often releases merchandise exclusive to Ape owners.  Yuga Labs historically prioritizes BAYC members when allocating new NFTs or launching new products.  Yuga Labs has a history of involving NFT holders in some of its decision-making processes, particularly when it comes to donating to charity.  Yuga Labs has introduced ApeCoin (APE), an ERC-20 token, as a utility and governance token that would further democratize the BAYC ecosystem and allow members to access services within and outside the ecosystem. To implement full decentralization, ApeCoin was launched by ApeCoin DAO, an entity made up of council members that would execute the decisions of the community.  Yuga Labs now has a $4 billion valuation thanks to a recent $450 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The team plans to use the funds to create a metaverse project and a game that will encapsulate all of the NFT collections it owns. According to the team, the plan is to launch a gamified and interoperable metaverse, called Otherside, where users can connect to the broader NFT world. This product will most likely go live sometime in April 2022.  How does ApeCoin work?  According to the project’s bio on Twitter, ApeCoin is a “governance and utility token used to empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3.”  Yuga Labs hopes that ApeCoin can become the anchor for the BAYC economy and governance system. The goal is for it to function as a governance and utility token in the BAYC ecosystem. Holders can not only use the token to vote on policy changes but also use it to purchase items both in the digital realm and real world.  And as mentioned earlier, the votes and decisions of the BAYC community will be administered by the board of ApeCoin DAO, which will also act as the committee members of Ape Foundation, another organization that will handle day-to-day operations. More specifically, the board consists of high-profile individuals. They include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian; Amy Wu, head of crypto exchange FTX’s venture arm; Maaria Bajwa of Sound Ventures; Animoca Brands’ Yat Siu; and Dean Steinbeck of Horizen Labs.  Looking at the structure that powers ApeCoin, it is clear that Yuga Labs has strategically removed itself from the operations of ApeCoin DAO for legal reasons. However, this has not stopped the team from allocating or receiving a share of the total supply of ApeCoin.  Interestingly, 160 million APE has been allocated to Yuga Labs, of which 10 million APE will go to charity. Another 80 million APE goes to the founders of BAYC and Yuga Labs. Also, 140 million APE was allocated to “launch contributors,” which will most likely include Yuga Labs' investors and partners.

42395727,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASz8JZ,1648046253,India’s Proposed Crypto Tax Rules Likely to Become Law Thursday,"India’s Finance Bill, the legislation that includes proposed rules on crypto taxation, is scheduled to be passed in parliament Thursday evening.  Any easing of the government's stance will be contained in amendments to the bill, which will be introduced to the lower house and followed by voting on each of the amendments, according to people familiar with parliamentary proceedings.  The bill was sent to the upper house for consideration. As a money bill, the role of the upper house is minimal. Suggestions of the upper house may or may not be considered by the lower house.  Discussions have already taken place with members of the lower house. The bill is expected to be passed by the lower house by the end of the day.  “Unless major changes are made to the first proposed finance bill, the passage of the bill is merely a formality,” said Shehnaz Ahmed of the policy think tank Vidhi Legal.  Crypto taxation proposals include a 30% capital gains tax, a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS), no offsetting of losses and taxation of gifts.  “I don’t expect the government to make any changes to the proposals on 30% capital gains tax, the 1% TDS or on other aspects of the tax proposals that needed clarity such as the offsetting of losses,"" said Subhash Garg, former secretary in the Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs, who helmed the government’s first report to propose actions concerning cryptocurrencies.  When initially announced, the government's proposals spurred excitement and confusion over whether the country was approving crypto as an asset by taxing it. The government has since clarified that cryptocurrencies remain unregulated in India. Just because they are taxed does not mean they are legal.  Since the announcement, efforts to reduce the taxes in the form of a change.org petition, an online campaign like #reducecryptotax, and meetings between industry and government have taken place.  Reports have indicated the government has also been working on classifying crypto under the indirect tax law of GST (Goods and Services).

42394547,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBXcP,1648044720,What Is Avalanche? A Look at the Popular ‘Ethereum-Killer’ Blockchain,"Decentralized finance (DeFi), which is a term for crypto-based financial services and products like lending and borrowing, is a major use case for Ethereum, the largest smart contract-focused blockchain.  But the problem with Ethereum, according to its critics, is that its transactions are slow and fees are too steep for average users, leading some to call it “the blockchain for the bankers.”  In response, a wave of contenders has tried to usurp Ethereum’s success by solving its problems with a rival blockchain. One of the main rivals is Avalanche, which bills itself as “blazingly fast, low-cost and eco-friendly.”  Avalanche’s development is led by New York-based Ava Labs, which was co-founded by Emin Gün Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University, Kevin Sekniqi, a Ph.D. student, and Maofan “Ted” Yin, who wrote the protocol used in Facebook’s ill-fated digital currency project Libra.  What is Avalanche?  Avalanche is a blockchain that promises to combine scaling capabilities and quick confirmation times through its Avalanche Consensus Protocol. It can process 4,500 TPShttps://support.avax.network/en/articles/4136568-how-many-transactions-per-second-does-avalanche-support (transactions per second). For Ethereum, that number is 14 TPS.  Avalanche’s native token, AVAX, is the 10th-largest with a market cap of $33 billion as of this writing in March 2022, according to data from CoinDesk.  Avalanche went live in September 2020 and has since become one of the largest blockchains. It has over $11 billion total value locked in its protocol, according to data from Defi Llama, making it the fourth-largest DeFi-supporting blockchain after Terra and Binance Smart Chain.  Avalanche’s thriving DeFi ecosystem contains some of the protocols from Ethereum, such as the lending protocol Aave and decentralized exchange protocol SushiSwap.  Trader Joe (no relation to the American supermarket chain Trader Joe’s) is Avalanche’s main decentralized exchange, with $1.47 billion locked into its liquidity pools. Benqi, with $1.26 billion locked into its smart contracts, is a popular lending platform that fulfills similar functions to Aave.  Avalanche isn’t only for DeFi, though. Ava Labs financially supports metaverse investments in the network, too, with the idea being that a fast and cheap network could effortlessly support blockchain-based games and virtual worlds.  How does Avalanche work?  A blockchain, as a decentralized system, needs a way to reach decisions among its globally distributed participants (validators) who maintain the public ledger – a way to reach consensus governed by a protocol. In Avalanche, that role is fulfilled by the Avalanche Consensus Protocol, which was first proposed in 2018 by a pseudonymous group called Team Rocket – a precursor to Ava Labs.  The Avalanche Consensus Protocol claims to combine the benefits of two other sets of consensus protocols known as Classical and Nakamoto.  Classical protocols: These are fast, green and low-maintenance, but aren’t typically decentralized or scalable. HotStuff, a Classical protocol, was famously used in Meta Platforms' (formerly Facebook) stablecoin project, Diem (formerly Libra).  Nakamoto protocols: A breakthrough technology by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, this kind of protocol offers decentralized, robust and scalable blockchains – as is the case with Bitcoin. But the network is costly to run, and transactions aren’t swift.  Avalanche is built across three chains:  The C-chain.  The X-chain.  The P-chain.  They stand for contract, exchange and platform. The C-chain hosts Avalanche's DeFi ecosystem, which is where most users conduct a majority of their transactions. The C-chain is powered by the Snowman Protocol, a specific application of the Avalanche Consensus Protocol. (Many things on Avalanche are winter-themed.)  How does AVAX token work?  Affectionately called the “red coin” by its holders, AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, with a maximum supply capped at 720 million tokens.  AVAX has at least three use cases on the network.  Avalanche users need AVAX to pay for transaction fees on the network. That’s similar to how ETH is used to pay for gas fees on Ethereum. In fact, Avalanche’s fee algorithms are based on Ethereum’s dynamic gas fee model, which is known as EIP-1559.  While Ethereum’s gas fee is partly burned and partly paid to miners, Avalanche’s fee is entirely burned. According to tracker site BurnedAvax, more than 1 million AVAX have been burned as of this writing, or close to $1 billion.  Second, AVAX is used in staking, which is a term for pledging crypto, in this case AVAX, to participate in the validation process and help secure the blockchain.  Proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin rely on validators running powerful computers known as mining rigs to secure the network. For proof-of-stake networks like Avalanche, the economic resource required to be given the right to validate isn't running powerful computers, but locking up crypto assets. Users who stake at least 2,000 AVAX can run their validator nodes and receive AVAX rewards. Those with less AVAX can join staking pools and combine their assets together with others in the network to become a single validator.  The third use of AVAX is more technical and less of an interest to regular users. It’s used as a basic unit of account between the multiple subnets deployed on Avalanche. A subnet is a set of validators working to achieve consensus.  Read more: Top 6 Cryptocurrencies You Can Stake  And of course, like all cryptocurrencies on the market, AVAX is also a speculative, volatile crypto asset investors can buy and sell in the hopes of making a profit.  How to use Avalanche  To get on the Avalanche network and try its DeFi protocols, you will need to buy AVAX on a centralized crypto exchange like Binance or Kraken. Then you will need to select “withdraw” on your exchange and transfer your AVAX tokes to a DeFi wallet, such as MetaMask.  Remember to choose C-chain, as otherwise your funds may be irreversibly lost on the wrong chain.  The user experience on Avalanche is similar to Ethereum’s interface because the C-chain runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). If you have used Ethereum before, your Ethereum public crypto wallet address that starts with 0x will also be your Avalanche address.  It’s also easy to bridge crypto from other chains into Avalanche, simply by connecting your DeFi wallet to a bridge protocol like Hop Exchange and following the instructions. Bridges are used to transfer tokens from one blockchain, or sidechain, to another – even if the two chains are directly interoperable.",POSITIVE,AVAX | ETH,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-avalanche-a-look-at-the-popular-ethereum-killer-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae653d5d34983892fea5ffca4435d11e8e0a0e9f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin, ether drop as investors reassess bearish implications of lingering macro uncertainty.  Featured stories: Investors in the cryptocurrency options markets are showing less demand for protection against prolonged price declines in ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. Trading indicators suggest there might a big move coming in the ratio between ether’s price and bitcoin’s, known as ETH/BTC.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Tim McCourt, senior managing director, CME Group  Daniel Lacalle, chief economist, Tressis  Damanick Dantes, markets reporter, CoinDesk  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin slipped to $42,000, pausing the post-Federal Reserve announcement recovery rally as the U.S. stock futures pointed to a weak open. Ether fell under $3,000, with chart traders waiting for a bullish UTC close above critical resistance on technical charts.  Market participants continued to assess the implications of the recent hawkish moves by the Federal Reserve ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden's Europe trip to discuss additional sanctions on Russia.  ""My take here is that fundamentals are very supportive, but fear of border risk appetite contagion is holding back the price action,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email.  ""The recent bounce in global equities – concurrent with spiking inflation, hawkish Fed and war – has left many investors unconvinced the recovery is sustainable,"" Solot added.  The cryptocurrency's 90-day correlation to the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, has hit a 17-month high of 0.495.  In other words, the cryptocurrency's near-term prospects appear tied to U.S. stocks and a continued rally in the S&P 500 could see bitcoin gain more ground. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 closed above its 200-day moving average – the first so-called bullish close in a month.  Also read: Bitcoin's Correlation to S&P 500 Hits 17-Month High  Latest Headlines  Crypto Lender Nexo Spins Out $150M Venture Arm for Web 3 Investments, Acquisitions  Bitcoin's Correlation to S&P 500 Hits 17-Month High  Thailand Bans Crypto as Means of Payment  Indian Superstar Amitabh Bachchan Pays Up After Tax Authorities' Action On Platform Hosting His NFTs  Worldcoin to Raise $100M at $3B Token Valuation: Report  Ether Options Shed Bearish Skew, ETH/BTC Eyes Big Move  By Omkar Godbole  The demand to protect against a prolonged weakness in ether appears to have waned, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives analytics firm Skew.  The six-month put-call skew, which tells how much lower strike puts expiring in six months are being bid up versus higher strike calls, has declined from 5% to 0% this week, shedding bias for puts or bearish bets offering downside protection for the first time since Jan. 25.  The long-term gauge has flipped from bearish to neutral a week after Ethereum developers successfully tested the long-awaited merge of the programmable blockchain's proof-of-work and proof-of-stake chains, dubbed Eth 2.0.  The upgrade will allow users to hold coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support network operations in return for newly minted coins and is likely to impact ether's price positively, analysts told CoinDesk.  The turnaround validates the bullish breakout on ether's daily chart confirmed on Monday.  While the one-week, one- and three-month skews have retreated from February highs, they continue to show a preference for puts, meaning fears of a short-term pullback persist. Given the lingering geopolitical uncertainty and U.S. recession fears, that's hardly surprising.  The dollar value dedicated to ether options contracts has topped the $6 billion mark for the first time in more than a month. On Friday, ether options worth $2.28 billion are set to expire.  Ether-bitcoin volatility spread suggests a big move in ETH/BTC  The spread between the one-month implied volatility (IV) for ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC), a measure of expected relative price turbulence between the two, has turned negative for the first time since March 2021, per data provider Skew.  In other words, ether's implied volatility is trading at a discount to bitcoin for the first time in a year. Historically, the negative ether-bitcoin IV spread has marked the beginning of big rallies in the ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio.  For instance, ETH/BTC rallied over 180% to 0.082 in the weeks following the implied volatility spread's negative turn in mid-March 2021. The ratio doubled to 0.040 in less than two months after the implied volatility spread dipped below zero in mid-May 2020.  Outsized gains in most alternative cryptocurrencies usually accompany a rally in the ether-bitcoin ratio. ""The fundamentals for ETH are aligned for a move upwards, however a rally in ETH would also likely lead to an alt-wide rally across the board,"" Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.  ETH/BTC was trading near 0.07 at press time, according to charting platform TradingView.  ""We are seeing some strength in ETH, particularly relative to other assets in the ecosystem. ETH/BTC is now trading at around 0.07 again and will soon me meeting some short-term technical resistance at 0.072,"" Dibb added.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/23/first-mover-americas-ether-options-shed-bearish-skew-for-first-time-in-2-months-ethbtc-ratio-eyes-big-move,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38d940fc382553bd4e9e0622d59c230c256b3ce8-612x407.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395737,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASz8RR,1648040432,Ex-Polychain Partner Tekin Salimi Launches $125M Crypto Venture Fund,"Tekin Salimi, a former general partner of crypto venture giant Polychain Capital, is launching a $125 million fund for seed investments. He said he later plans to convert the fund into a founder-owned decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  The fund, called “dao5,” arrives as the lines between traditional venture vesting and crypto-native investment DAOs are becoming increasingly blurred, and big players are leaving the incumbent venture giants to strike out on their own.  Soon to be announced at the Avalanche Summit conference in Barcelona, Spain, dao5 has already secured the $125 million in funding, raised primarily from “crypto-native” investors and with Salimi himself contributing a portion of the capital.  While dao5 will target check sizes of roughly $500,000 to $2 million for pre-seed and seed-stage deals, Salimi is experimenting with the fund’s structure, namely, giving the founders of the fund’s portfolio company a stake in the carry by eventually converting the fund into a DAO.  “I think one venture capital ideal has always been to create a community of their founders,” said Salimi, pointing to incubators like Y Combinator, which organizes its founders into cohorts and boasts an illustrious alumni network. “It’s hard to incentivize founders to help each other. What DAOs really unlock is the financial incentives.”  How dao5 works  Every time dao5 makes an investment, the founders of the projects will receive an allocation of tokens representing the profits of the fund. Namely, Salimi and the rest of the dao5 investment team get diluted.  Over time, this process results in every portfolio founder having economic exposure to the token of every other portfolio founder. The goal is to incentivize founders to collaborate with each other, collectively driving up the value of the tokens.  Salimi admits that much of the tokenomics is still up in the air, and the fund does not plan to convert into a DAO until approximately three years in, or when at least 70% of the capital has been deployed. Additionally, the DAO’s tokens will only be valuable if the fund is profitable.  The fund’s advisory board – which will help with diligence and originate deals – boasts heavyweight founders like Terra’s Do Kwon and Avalanche’s Emin Gün Sirer.  Salimi said he’s looking to invest in “category-defining” projects that fall more into the fringes of crypto than the traditional platform or infrastructure companies. Salimi points to OlympusDAO as one project that “changed his thinking” about tokenomics, and the type of boundary-pushing experiment he’s looking to fund.  “I use the word ‘experiment’ a lot to describe this,” Salimi told CoinDesk. “On the one hand, it’s a traditional venture fund. On the other hand, it’s uncharted waters in starting a new form of founder money.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/23/ex-polychain-partner-tekin-salimi-launches-125m-crypto-venture-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d452b3ea128b2174d606c03eefbf3497e678064-2587x1848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Web 3.0 is appealing because it is decentralized, which means that instead of customers accessing the internet through services mediated by firms like Google, Apple, or Facebook, individuals own and regulate areas of the internet themselves. Web 3.0 does not require &apos;permission,&apos; which implies that central authorities do not have the authority to select who has access to what services, nor does it require &apos;trust,&apos; which means that virtual transactions between two or more parties do not require the use of an intermediary. Web 3.0 technically preserves user privacy better because these agencies and intermediaries are conducting the majority of the data collection. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is a Web 3.0 component that&apos;s gaining traction. It comprises using the blockchain to conduct real-world financial transactions without the involvement of banks or the government. Meanwhile, many significant corporations and venture capital firms are pouring money into Web 3.0, and it&apos;s difficult to imagine that their involvement won&apos;t lead to concentrated authority.

42411478,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glONpI,1648036800,Vitalik Buterin Should Let Ethereum Be Ethereum,"Every time I come across Vitalik Buterin, I’m impressed by his intellectual curiosity and underlying earnestness.  The former is rare; there aren’t many folks who can hold their own with Tyler Cowen. The latter, fortunately, is something he shares with other high-achieving folks, many of whom work in Washington, D.C., and other areas considered “intellectual power centers,” like Silicon Valley.  Eric Seal is a professional real estate developer and amateur Bitcoin advocate.  Despite what you hear in the media, most of them don’t care primarily about building their financial and reputational wealth; the majority strive to do the right thing and work to create products and services that better the lives of others, often for underserved communities. That’s a good thing.  (Now comes the “however” you knew was coming.)  However, what happens time and again is that unquestionably well-intentioned and decent folks like Buterin become uncomfortable when the interests and judgments of others collide with their own. They doubt the free market when it begins to take something they created in a direction they didn’t foresee and don’t particularly like.  Read more: Vitalik Buterin's Dad on Ukraine, Censorship and Decentralization  And here’s what’s most important for folks like Buterin. Individual interests, the decisions they underlie and the actions they cause are what make free markets work, and free markets – as ugly, unpredictable and unfair as they can often be – are what drive human progress. Billions of people making their own decisions as to how they spend their time, energy and resources are the best way to allocate the world’s time, energy and resources. Bitcoin and Ethereum are tremendous new technologies that offer unparalleled opportunities to improve this allocation.  Bitcoin accomplishes this through its unstoppable and uncaring process of block verification. A simple process of 1s and 0s grinding forward every 10 minutes without human interaction or influence. Bitcoin takes all comers equally and doesn’t stop to assess the merit of individual blocks or the direction those blocks are taking things. Quite literally, it aggregates the private decisions of all who participate and doesn’t ask, “Well, gee, do I really like where this block is headed?”  As is clear in his recent Time interview, Buterin favors impersonal decentralization in concept, but not so much in practice. Intellectually, he understands the power of a decentralized network like Bitcoin, but in his heart he wants it to do the right things that matter to him. That’s why he helped create Ethereum, as he believed that “using [Bitcoin] purely for currency was a waste” (a belief that many bitcoiners probably share). Ethereum is great technology, an awesome platform for individual human creativity to flourish.  But it may not stay that way forever. According to Buterin, “we can’t wait years,” and we can’t allow crypto, generally, and, by inference, Ethereum, to be “implemented wrong.” We can’t allow the focus to be on “things that are immediately profitable,” so we must “exercise our voice.” After all, “[there] definitely are lots of people that are just buying yachts and Lambos.” (Sorry to anyone who works for yacht and Lambo manufacturers; I’m sure you can find jobs providing other goods and services on the approved list.)  More generally, in Buterin’s own words, “[t]he goal of crypto is not to play games with million-dollar pictures of monkeys; it’s to do things that accomplish meaningful effects in the real world.” (Sorry, again, if you’re an artist who has figured out a way to support yourself by creating pictures of monkeys or other unapproved content that folks want to buy.)  Read more: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Touts Essay Collection in ETHDenver Talk  Buterin and his Ethereum brethren have brought immense opportunity and created great prosperity for the world and will likely continue to do so for many years. We’re lucky to have them around. Seriously.  But they must stop thinking they know what’s best for everyone. They must stop judging what everyone else is doing with the platform they created. Humans don’t advance in a straight line up and to the right, and it probably doesn’t appear like a line at all if you live through the twists and turns of innovation. Those “intellectual power centers” referred to above are full of smart, well-intentioned folks who think they know how everyone else’s time, energy and resources should be allocated to maximize human flourishing. They don’t. They can’t. No one can.  Buterin and his Ethereum supporters have already shown themselves willing to put their collective thumb on the scale to effect an outcome they viewed as right. Moving forward, I hope that won’t be repeated. I hope they’ll let Ethereum develop unfettered and go wherever its user base takes it. Based on everything we’re hearing from Buterin, however, I wouldn’t bet on it:  “Good crazy is when there’s tech work and research and development and public goods coming out of the other end. So there’s this battle. And we have to be intentional, and make sure more of the right things happen.”  Read more: Vitalik Buterin Calls Canada's Use of Banks to Stifle Protestors 'Dangerous'",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Eric Seal,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/23/vitalik-buterin-should-let-ethereum-be-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69ce676974db09b5890fbee2b61a5d3e645c9739-4000x2668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Along with Cowen co-President Dan Charney, Forman told CoinDesk the launch has been a year in the making. “We will have [a] significant first mover advantage,” they said.  Further, they added, Cowen’s “more nimble, entrepreneurial culture” puts the bank at an advantage versus its larger bulge-bracket competitors.  Cowen’s move comes as more investment banks are using their positions to try bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and institutional crypto demands. Earlier this week, for instance, Goldman Sachs (GS) completed its first over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency-related trade with former partner Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital.  Cowen’s Forman said the bank is already trading around 16 tokens including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL) and USD coin (USDC), and has a client list in the hundreds. In addition to trading, he said, being “thought leaders” for clients will also be part of the new unit’s mandate.

42410898,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3hQ,1648035000,"Vitalik Buterin, Crypto’s Public Intellectual?","There are a lot of things that the blockchain faithful, myself included, have been right about. Many of the predictions I made years ago about the popularity of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and the rise of DeFi (decentralized finance) have borne out. In turn, my conviction about the inevitability of these technologies borders on the pathological.  But in spite of that conviction, sometimes it’s still so strange to see it all play out. Take, for instance, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin – previously best known on social media for this dance – on the cover of Time magazine:  The accompanying piece was an evenhanded treatment from staff writer Andrew Chow, as evidenced by the fact that it made both blockchain fans and skeptics extremely angry. It was also a sign of a possible pivot from Buterin, one that I think would be good for both his career and for Ethereum: his increased willingness to work in the spotlight as a public intellectual.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  “One of the decisions I made in 2022 is to try to be more risk-taking and less neutral. [...] I would rather Ethereum offend some people than turn into something that stands for nothing,” he said during the Time interview.  More than a talking head with Vulcan cheekbones  While the 29 year-old Canadian was discussing stepping more into the public light in the context of guiding Ethereum’s development, I would encourage Buterin to consider pivoting to a role as a cultural commentator.  If he chooses to take up the mantle of a public intellectual, he would be imminently qualified.  As a writer, he’s been a hidden gem for the better part of a decade, commanding not just vast technical knowledge but also possessing the unique gift of making esoteric topics digestible. He can single-handedly establish disciplines – and I would argue he did just that with DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) following the publication of “DAOs, DACs, DAs and More: An Incomplete Terminology Guide” – as well as with advancing the discourse around an existing topic, as he did with Endgame, a piece speculating on the future of the multi-chain world.  Read more: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Touts Essay Collection in ETHDenver Talk  His detractors, however, will say he’s too orthogonal of a thinker to be a popular commentator (which is the nicest way I can think of to say “the dude is pretty f**king weird”). Whenever his name comes up trolls are quick to point toward a tweet he made years ago arguing that the consumption of child pornography is less ethically odious than the consumption of heroin.  Likewise, another tweet at the end of last year about the importance of artificial wombs prompted a range of angry reactions, with some observers accusing Buterin of misogyny while others simply seemed to be exhausted with how bizarre and unprompted the conversation was to begin with.  Personally, I think the good outweighs the bad. While profiles tend to center on his libertarian influences and leanings, he is immensely well-read across the ideological spectrum: He also frequently cites anthropologist David Graeber, and some of his best s**tposts are plays on British philosopher Derek Parfit thought experiments, including the Teletransportation Paradox and The Repugnant Conclusion. That’s the good kind of weird, and the kind of breadth I like to see in commentators.  All that esoterica and knowledge and talent devoted simply to thinking things and relying those thoughts – there aren’t many technologists, writers and thinkers of his caliber – and it would be a gift to have him touring universities and writing op-eds for a few decades.  The wider public would be lucky to have him.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.

Validated takes  Ethereum scaling startup Optimism closed a $150 million Series B funding round at a $1.65 billion valuation. BACKGROUND: Paradigm and Andreessen Horowitz, two giant Silicon Valley investments firms, co-led the funding round to help Optimism address user demand on the Ethereum blockchain. With about $367.04 million in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFi Llama, Optimism is continuing to play an essential role in the future of how Ethereum will address its ability to expand its rapidly growing network.  Leading lending platform, Aave, launched its V3, the latest version of its protocol. BACKGROUND: With about $20.08 billion of locked liquidity across seven networks and more than 13 markets, Aave’s third iteration “provides greater capital efficiencies, increased security, and cross-chain functionality.”  Owners of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection were airdropped 10,000 ApeCoin each. BACKGROUND: Even though Yuga Labs, BAYC’s parent company, said it will use ApeCoin for new products and services, the ERC-20 token is owned and operated by ApeCoin DAO, where holding ApeCoin is the only requirement for DAO membership. Data from CoinGecko indicates that ApeCoin, the latest instance of a meme-driven token, has a market capitalization of $1.49 billion making it the 76th largest coin as of March 22.  Andrew Yang, former U.S. presidential candidate, launched GoldenDAO to focus on Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) issues. BACKGROUND: GoldenDAO is intended to be a platform based on Web 3 infrastructure for AAPI solidarity. Joining GoldenDAO requires the purchase of a membership NFT, with public minting slated for March 31. The advent of GoldenDAO reflects the growing trend of how DAOs are being used as vehicles for social activism.

The regulators cited that rising issues related to money laundering and the inability of the Central Bank to provide assistance led to the banning of crypto payments as the only solution. The reason stated by the regulators is the extensive usage of digital assets that have been threatening the financial system and economy of the nation. Additionally, the Thai SEC stated that digital assets did not offer improved efficiency and caused volatility in the market and high transaction fees as well. What Does The New Rule State? In a statement shared on Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission stated that crypto exchanges have until the end of April to comply with the new rules. Crypto exchanges can do so by halting advertisements and systems that help facilitate payments through digital wallets. Firms are requested to warn their customers against the use of digital assets and users found breaching the rules will have their accounts canceled.

Nexo Ventures will also ""explore the feasibility of enabling Nexo's users to invest alongside us, thereby leveraging our capabilities to facilitate investor diversification and wealth maximization,"" Metodieva said in the statement.  The Web 3 ecosystem has become an area of interest for investors in the crypto and blockchain industry, with several similar funds emerging in recent months. In December, Hashed raised $200 million for Web 3 ecosystem development, and in March Griffin Gaming Partners announced a $750 million fund.  Gaming, in particular, has attracted industry heavyweights, with crypto exchange FTX last year investing $100 million to fund gaming studios that integrate the Solana blockchain into games. The fund was raised alongside Solana Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

42395720,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASz8Cg,1648024660,Bitcoin's Correlation to S&P 500 Hits 17-Month High,"The perennial debate of whether bitcoin (BTC) is a gold-like haven asset or a risky investment may heat up as the cryptocurrency's sensitivity to stock markets increases – amid concerns the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening plans may tip the U.S. economy into recession.  The 90-day correlation between bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, and Wall Street's benchmark equity index, the S&P 500, rose to 0.49 on Friday, the highest since October 2020, according to data tracked by Arcane Research.  ""Bitcoin's correlation to the S&P 500 has only been higher for five days in BTC's history, showing that the current correlation regime is unprecedented in BTC's history,"" according to Arcane Research's weekly newsletter published on Tuesday.  The correlation has strengthened alongside a relentless tightening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, a sign the Fed may have a hard time avoiding much-feared stagflation with rapid-fire interest rate rises without destabilizing the economy. The yield curve, represented by the spread between the 10- and two-year yields, is now just 20 basis points (bp) short of inversion, or turning negative – an unusual setup that's often viewed as a recession indicator.  So the long-held crypto market belief of bitcoin being a digital haven is yet to come to fruition.  ""I wish I could say that crypto is really responding to fundamentals [high inflation], but I think the chief fundamental here is the crypto is responding to the rise in equity prices,"" Marc Chandler, managing director and chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, told CoinDesk TV when asked about bitcoin's recent rise.  Are stocks an inflation hedge?  The rising correlation comes as some analysts in traditional financial markets are starting to argue that stocks might actually serve as a decent hedge against inflation – because companies could theoretically raise prices to protect their profit margins.  It's a shift in focus that brings the stock market narrative closer to that of bitcoin, which has long been viewed by many investors as a potential hedge against fast-rising prices or a depreciating U.S. dollar.  The cryptocurrency has risen 8% since the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, last Wednesday, the first hike since 2018. Officials with the U.S. central bank also raised their inflation forecasts.  Bitcoin's price move higher since then has some wondering whether investors are parking money in the cryptocurrency to hedge against inflation.  However, the ascent seems to have been powered by the uptick in the stock markets. The S&P 500 has risen 6% since the Fed rate hike and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has rallied by 8.7%, according to data provided by charting platform TradingView.  ""What I am interested in is the change in bitcoin and change in Nasdaq and what you find is the correlation is over 60%,"" Chandler said. ""The stock market [has been] going bid.""  What could drive bitcoin's price higher?  According to Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading, macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties seem to be keeping bitcoin from drawing store of value bids. Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, of which CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary.  ""One of the main reasons is uncertainty,"" Acheson said in a LinkedIn post. ""Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and in times of uncertainty, harnessing that volatility – which is usually a feature, not a bug – is difficult enough to dissuade even the most experienced volatility traders. This is especially acute in the current market, given that the uncertainty is driven largely by the war in Europe, and it is hard to predict outcomes when we do not know if the news emerging from the conflict zone is trustworthy.""  In the post, titled ""Bitcoin's battle,"" Acheson added: ""The outlook for rates is also a source of significant market uncertainty, as last week's hike of 25 [basis points] will not make a dent in the inflation already hurting consumers' pockets, let alone that which is yet to come.""  Bitcoin was last trading near $42,180, representing a 0.8% drop on the day. Since late January the cryptocurrency has been restricted between $36,000 to $45,000.  Per Acheson, bitcoin needs needs ""either renewed speculation or new macro investment to be able to break out of the current range.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/23/bitcoins-correlation-to-sp-500-hits-17-month-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5431cf97922d74340a5daa4a9fc0231e936ad3d-1920x1434.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The regulator cited money laundering concerns and the inability of the central bank to step in and provide assistance as the reason behind the ban.  The Thai SEC stressed this is not a ban on crypto trading and digital assets, which has become more popular among the locals in the last two years, just a ban on the use of crypto for payments.  In January, Thai authorities announced a plan to regulate digital asset payments in the country.  In the latest announcement, the Thai SEC said that digital assets do not provide improved efficiency to the payments market because of their volatility and high transaction fees.  Last year, many domestic property developers looked to crypto as a way to revitalize interest in the country’s condominium market, which is largely geared towards foreigners.
