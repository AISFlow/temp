42380882,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX90c9J,1529445043,Tron Bought BitTorrent And Crypto Won't Stop Talking About It,"The founder of a little-known cryptocurrency is making big waves.  First leaked last week, more details emerged Tuesday on how Justin Sun, the founder of a controversial cryptocurrency project called Tron (with a market capitalization of more than $3 billion), is acquiring the file-sharing service BitTorrent for as much as $140 million.  (A subsequent CoinDesk report pins that total at closer to $120 million).  If you just did a double-take, you're not alone.  A quick recap: Tron, the 10th-largest cryptocurrency in the world according to data published by CoinMarketCap, is in the midst of gearing up for its big software launch.  The project officially kicked off efforts in May to shift from the ethereum token it used for fundraising (in what's called a 'token swap') to new coins on a wholly independent blockchain, dubbed Odyssey 2.0. But the road to that point has been a tumultuous one, marked by allegations of plagiarism about its white paper.  As such, the acquisition was yet another opportunity for supporters and critics to spar.  Investors, you can guess, were more than ecstatic about the news.  What motives?  Amidst the social celebration, though, some of the network's more ardent critics took the opportunity to raise questions about the timing of the news as well as the reasoning behind the acquisition.  Variety  and TorrentFreak provide some key background to the sale's origins.  Sun reportedly began pursuing acquisition of BitTorrent last September under a ""no shop"" clause that prevented BitTorrent from engaging in similar talks with other potential buyers.  On May 25, word got out that this clause had been violated by BitTorrent and that Sun had filed legal paperwork to sue. Fast forward to today, when news was broken by Variety of a merger between a registered company called Rainberry Acquisition Inc. owned by Sun and Rainberry Inc, the actual company owning BitTorrent.  Beyond the speculation over how negotiations for the acquisition of BitTorrent actually went down behind the scenes, critics have questioned the strategic motivation of even purchasing BitTorrent's file-sharing services in the first place.  For one, the technology behind the services BitTorrent offers is entirely open-source and available for public view.  As such, some have been suggesting that what Sun is going after with this acquisition is not BitTorrent's services per se but rather the established platform BitTorrent possesses from which to create entirely new services.  Others feel that the speculation is unnecessary given the sheer reach of BitTorrent around the globe servicing millions of users each day.  Open questions  Still, without a clearly defined motive, critics of Tron continue to warn away investors and view this acquisition as a poor attempt to ""legitimize"" what is clearly, to some, a ""scam.""  For now, it seems Sun is content with staying tight-lipped about potential next steps for Tron as it relates to BitTorrent. (BitTorrent announced Tuesday that it doesn't plan to shift its services in light of the deal).  Still, it might be too early to tell just what's in store.  In an interview on Huobi Talk, transcribed and translated on Medium, he said:  ""Regarding how we can unite with BitTorrent, I will keep it secret first. In July, we will have some activities with BitTorrent, please pay attention to that, thank you.""

The Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO said in an interview on Tuesday that ""it's not for me"" when asked about the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Appearing at the Economic Club of New York, he remarked:  ""I don't do it. I don't own bitcoin.""  Blankfein has struck a kind of middle-of-the-road tone on cryptocurrencies in the past, which is notable considering that his firm is reportedly toeing the waters of services built around the tech.  The investment banking giant is said to have developed plans for a bitcoin futures trading operation, according to New York Times, with an eye on growing that capacity depending on the results and approval from regulators.  In a previous interview with Bloomberg in November, Blankfein said he has a ""level of discomfort"" with bitcoin but is open to it.  ""I've learned over the years that there's a lot of things that workout pretty well that I don't love,"" he said at the time. ""Maybe in the new world, something gets backed by consensus ... If we went into the future and bitcoins were successful, I would be able to explain how it's a natural evolution of money.""  The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Blankfein is preparing to exit the company, a move that could come as soon as the end of this year.

In a statement posted to its website Tuesday, BitTorrent wrote that the company has ""no plans to change"" its business model and will not charge fees for any of its services. Further, the company stated that it has ""no plans to enable mining of cryptocurrency now or in the future.""  The company was recently acquired by the Tron Foundation's Justin Sun, according to a report from Variety.  The statement continued:  ""BitTorrent has been a pioneer of peer-to-peer file sharing and we believe our vision of democratizing the Web by enabling decentralized, resilient access to information remains as relevant as it was when we started.""  News that the company would be acquired first emerged last week, and on Tuesday it was reported that the price tag of the deal was $140 million. However, BitTorrent co-founder and former president Ashwin Navin told CoinDesk in an interview that the actual acquisition cost was $120 million.  ""The value of the deal is about $120 million. I think there are some numbers out in the public that were wrong, I think the value is lower than that,"" Navin told CoinDesk.  Price tag aside, the news sent Tron's TRX token's up nearly 20 percent, according to a previous report from CoinDesk.  Sun, who founded the Tron Foundation, reportedly said during a radio show that he has ""full respect for BitTorrent."" However, he declined to say what he hoped the two companies would work on after the merger, only noting that news would be released next month.  On Tuesday, BitTorrent concluded its post by saying ""we reiterate that we are committed to our hundreds of million users worldwide and will continue to invest and innovate in the BitTorrent and uTorrent products.""

The world's largest brewer has launched its first ad campaigns through the Kiip mobile marketing app, which uses ethereum's blockchain to record and track data. The goal is to monitor and, eventually, expand the reach of a particular ad, according to a press release.  The campaign, which started two weeks ago, has featured five of AB InBev's most popular brands, including Budweiser, Bud Light, Michelob Ultra, Limeatrita and Estrellas.  The campaign is built around Kiip's new blockchain product, which is designed to enhance transparency and tackle issues like mobile ad fraud by keeping the campaign database available to all players in mobile ad sales.  Different metrics - including impressions, engagement and price - are encoded on the ethereum blockchain, and AB InBev can track these ad activities every hour. This approach reduces the amount of time that the campaign's organizers spend in tracking the metrics. Meanwhile, the ad buyers can pay only for the ads that meet their criteria.  The new ad system is only AB InBev's latest move into the crypto space. The Belgium-based behemoth joined a consortium to experiment with the blockchain technology for global shipping uses in March, as previously reported by CoinDesk.

42380877,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX90c4H,1529428251,John McAfee Won't Promote ICOs Anymore Because of 'SEC Threats',"John McAfee, the cybersecurity tycoon-turned-cryptocurrency backer said Tuesday that he will end his work on initial coin offerings (ICOs).  In a tweet, McAfee cited ""SEC threats"" when revealing that he would stop working on token sales or recommend them to his 800,000-plus followers on Twitter.  It represents the end of what was reportedly a notable line of business, with McAfee revealing in April that his ICO team was charging more than $100,000 for a single promotional tweet, according to a report from The Verge.  McAfee's statement follows a period of sustained criticism against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the U.S. securities market regulator that has steadily increased its oversight – and activity – in the crypto space since it said last summer that American securities laws may apply to some token sales.  It also comes just days after a senior SEC official said that ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – isn't a security, which largely came as a relief to members of the crypto community.  Just last week, for example, McAfee declared via Twitter that he would not accept the SEC's view that many token sales qualify as securities offerings. Indeed, earlier this month, McAfee challenged SEC chairman Jay Clayton to a public debate, posting what he claimed was the agency chief's phone number and encouraging his followers to make contact.  Plans to cease promoting ICOs aside, McAfee indicated that he isn't walking away entirely.  McAfee wrote that he was drawing up ""an equivalent alternative to ICOs"" which he said ""the SEC cannot touch.""  ""Please have Patience,"" he concluded.  The SEC declined to comment when reached.

42380881,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX90c6n,1529424031,Tron Price Spikes After Blockchain Founder Acquires BitTorrent,"Tron (TRX) is reporting double-digit gains on Tuesday and is the biggest gainer among top 100 cryptocurrencies.  The cryptocurrency seemingly picked up a bid after reports started doing the rounds that Tron Foundation founder Justin Sun acquired BitTorrent - the owner of popular file-sharing client uTorrent - for $140 million. Rumors of the acquisition have been floating around since the end of May and the deal was reportedly signed last week.  As of now, it is unclear how the acquisition will help TRON cement its reputation as a truly decentralized internet. Though Sun is generally rather vocal, he has remained unusually silent about the deal. Nevertheless, the acquisition has certainly revved up investor interest in the cryptocurrency.  At press time, the world's 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $0.04938 - up 17.9 percent, having clocked a nine-day high of $0.051107 at 18:44 UTC, according to CoinMarketCap. Its market capitalization has moved above $3.2 billion.  Despite the stellar gains, it is still too early to call a bullish trend reversal, the price chart analysis indicates.  Daily chart  The above chart shows (prices as per Bitfinex) TRX is trapped in a falling channel (bearish setup). So, the broader outlook remains bearish despite double-digit gains seen in the last 24 hours.  That said, the recovery from $0.0374 (June 13 low) to $0.051 (daily high) has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has breached the falling trendline resistance in favor of the bulls. Thus, TRX may remain better bid in the next few days.  View  TRX may attack the 100-day moving average (MA), currently lined up at $0.0553 in the next few days. A break above that level would expose the falling channel hurdle, currently seen at $0.0638.  Only a high volume close (as per UTC) above the falling channel resistance would confirm a long-run bearish-to-bullish trend change.  Bearish scenario: TRX will likely drop to $0.032 (falling channel support) if the bulls fail to defend $0.041 despite the positive news flow.

In a joint statement signed on May 11 and published on Tuesday, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), the Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia and the General-Commissariat of National Police said that the decision was made after observing a growth in cryptocurrency trading in the country.  Suggesting that such activities ""will cause potential risks to the publics [sic] and society as a whole,"" the statement declares:  ""Competent authorities clarify that the propagation, circulation, buying, selling, trading and settlement of cryptocurrencies without obtaining license from competent authorities are illegal activities.""  The statement further says that failure to obtain a license for the above activities ""shall be penalized in accordance with applicable laws.""  The three agencies go on to explain that involvement with cryptocurrencies can bring investor risk arising from price volatility, cybercrime, and a lack of consumer protections, further listing several crypto projects – including the alleged Ponzi scheme OneCoin – as examples.  So far it isn't clear just what license needs to be applied for, or what would be required for a successful application, but the requirement is likely to present a notable barrier for investors.  The joint statement marks a notable widening of crypto-focused restrictions kicked off by the NBC in December 2017, when it prohibited domestic financial institutions from offering account services to cryptocurrency investors and traders, according to an earlier report from Phnom Penh Post.  Since then, cryptocurrency related projects such as initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto trading activities continued to operate in a gray area, as regulators had yet to publish an explicit legal framework providing clarity for users of the nascent technology.

42380868,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX90bsx,1529409623,"Bitcoin, DLT and Bank Ledgers: A Central Banker's View","Yao Qian is the director-general of the Institute of Digital Money of the People's Bank of China.  This article represents his personal, academic opinions, not those of the institution.      Bookkeeping refers to the recording of economic data in account books.  A ledger, therefore, is a book with a certain format based on original vouchers and recorded in sequence for all economic transactions. The original vouchers are those obtained when business occurs or is completed to record or prove the evidence of the occurrence or completion of the economic business.  It is the original data and an important basis for accounting, reflecting the most primitive transaction information. It is also key to clarifying economic responsibility.  Ledgers are kept in various material, traditionally, in paper form. But with the development of information technology (IT), ledgers have gradually been digitalized and various types of accounting databases have emerged. Indeed, accounting computerization has become the main tool for accounting work today.  The emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT) may be another major leap forward after the digitization of ledgers. In the proof-of-work mechanism, miners complete the bookkeeping process for transaction records through ""mining"" and provide a publicly visible decentralized, shared ledger for each node of the network.  Each blockchain is a ledger, and there is no essential difference in the accounting sense from the traditional ledgers. However, from a technical point of view, the DLT ledger not only inherits the traditional bookkeeping philosophy, but also has incomparable advantages thanks to certain innovative aspects.  As such, DLT can play an important role in addressing some acute problems regarding corporate ledgers, country ledgers and industry ledgers.  A shared philosophy  The traditional model for bookkeeping is based on accounts.  In accounting, an account is set up according to accounting categories. It is used to record the increase and decrease of account elements and to reflect the result of the changes. In terms of system implementation, an account is the carrying body of a series of service agreement. An account can contain a variety of products and services. The balance of the account is changed as a result of recording, aggregating, categorizing and consolidating of the original transaction data from the products and services.  Traditional e-payments are achieved through changes in the balance of accounts opened at centralized institutions, relying entirely on the behavior of the central agency. In contrast, the bitcoin system uses another new model in bookkeeping processing: the UTXO (unspent transaction output) mode.  From the perspective of economics, a UTXO is essentially a claim on future value based on public consensus.  Specifically, when a transaction is completed, each node forms a consensus on the transaction behavior and its results. The consensus confirms that the seller, after selling the goods or services, obtains the right to buy the same valued goods and services from other sellers in the future. This future value-claiming right is widely accepted with no objection and is used in the next transaction for payment and is refused by no one.  The necessary and sufficient condition for obtaining this right is that there must be a corresponding transaction that has obtained the consensus between the nodes. With related terms, the input of a transaction (input) is required for getting the output of the transaction (output).  Inputs and outputs  The blockchain system underlying bitcoin describes and completes the transfer of future value-claiming rights arising from transactions by constructing transaction inputs and transaction outputs that contain unlocking scripts and locking scripts. The input of a transaction is the hash value and the output index of the previous transaction, indicating that the transaction input corresponds to the previous transaction output.  The output of this transaction contains a locking script which will be unlocked by the unlocking script of next transaction in the future. The owner of the future value-claiming right constructs an unlocking script through the bitcoin transaction verification engine to prove his right in the transaction, and then transfers this right to the next entity by locking script, and so on. The unlocking script and the locking script are connected into a continuous value circulation chain.  The bitcoin blockchain does not require an account, but completes the ""value"" transfer through its UTXOs. UTXOs play the role of ""currency.""  In fact, the essence of currency is a future value-claiming right that is widely recognized by society. A UTXO, then, is a kind of future value-claiming right obtained by consensus of the participants in the blockchain network, which is closer to the essence of currency.  However, it plays the role of a trading medium and performs a payment only within limited consensus.  The bitcoin system also stipulates that UTXO 's price unit is a ""satoshi"" and that a Satoshi is equal to one bitcoin in order to make UTXO perform better as a currency.  This is the essence of bitcoin. Bitcoin is a kind of value symbol or value unit that represents the future value-claiming right of a certain value on which a consensus has been reached.  UXTOs and accounts (differences)  When applied against other blockchains, we can understand more about this approach.  A UTXO is a form of value transfer completely different from an account, but the two things do not conflict with each other. In a sense, we can understand the blockchain as a transaction ""journal account,"" which immutably records all the transaction information by means of encoding.  In reality, the account information we are accustomed to is also the secondary processing of information on a transaction's ""journal account."" It is only that UTXO, through the design of the unlocking script and the locking script, concatenates a transfer and distribution channel for the future value-claiming right between the transactions with different timing. UTXO information and transaction information are unified.  Therefore, using the traditional account processing ideas, the value expressed by the UTXO forms can also be converted into that expressed by the account forms.  For example, the account balance in a bitcoin wallet is the result of the aggregation calculation of its UTXOs. Ethereum, on the other hand, introduces a traditional account based on the blockchain, and describes the process of trading on the account as a state transition function.  In this way, the state is composed of objects called ""accounts,"" and state transitions that transfer value and information between accounts. Each account is a 20-byte address, which can be trader's address or the contract's address. Through the state transition, the system automatically calculates the balance of each account.  Obviously, this is no different from the account processing originally undertaken by the central agency, except that the agency has been changed to the algorithm code. Thus, following the UTXO mode, in a DLT ledger, the account mode similar to the traditional ledger appeared.  Balance and flow  Balance and flow are two important concepts in accounting.  Balance refers to the amount of a variable at a certain point in time. Flow refers to the cumulative change over a period of time. The balance sheet reflects the ""financial status"" of a company on a specific balance sheet date, including the actual amount of the company's assets, liabilities and the owner's equity.  The cash flow statement reflects the ""cash flow"" of a certain accounting period of the company, and the income statement reflects the ""business results"" of a certain accounting period of the company.  Therefore, the statement of asset and liability is the balance accounting of the company's economic information and is a ""snapshot"" of the company at a specific point in time. The cash flow statement and the income statement are the flow accounting of the economic information of the company and reflect the changes of the company during a specific period. The commonly seen periods include the month, quarter, half year and year.  The balance is static and reflects the status quo, and the flow is dynamic and ongoing. The two are linked to each other and can be converted into each other: (opening balance + increase in current period - reduction in current period = ending balance).  Among them, the balance at the beginning and the end of the period are balance. The increase in the current period and the reduction in the current period are flows.  The analysis of financial statements needs to not only analyze the financial status of a company at a certain point in time in terms of balance, but also compares with historical data, analyzing the changes in the financial status of the company and the reasons behind it in terms of flow, so as to provide a more thorough understanding of the financial situation of the company  Mix and match  As mentioned above, in essence, the UTXO mode immutably records all transaction information by means of encoding, and it is a mode of flow accounting.  Reduced by aggregation, UTXOs can be converted to account balances, and by splitting the account balance the UTXO result can be obtained. In computer terms, we can describe the conversion between UTXO and account as a split/map/reduce architecture. From UTXO to account, it is the process of map/reduce.  When a miner verifies and packages each transaction, it is map, which verifies and updates each UTXO, equivalent to generating a new key-value pair. The process of reduce is shifted to user's wallets, and each UTXO is aggregated, thereby obtaining the fund balance based on the concept of the account in the user's wallet.  From the account to UTXO is a split process, this work also occurs in user's wallet. After receiving a currency transfer request, the wallet needs to split the transfer amount and quote multiple UTXOs as transaction input.  Compared with account mode, the advantage of the UTXO mode is that it is easy to parallelize and improve efficiency. However, the UTXO mode needs to store all flow information, and data storage burden is high. The account mode only requests the current balance information and ignores all flow information, but the premise is that the current balance information is reliable.  From a regulatory point of view, the UTXO mode stores all flow information and is more conducive to supervision and auditing. Still, it should be said that bitcoin's UTXO model is rather extreme in that it removes the concept of an account in a sense.  However, UTXOs and accounts have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the two models can be integrated to show their respective strengths.  For example, in order to speed up synchronization, one can introduce an account in UTXO mode (ethereum is a typical example). For concurrent processing, account mode can refer to the UTXO concept to split accounts, that is, different departments create different accounts. the same user has multiple accounts, and the transactions of the respective accounts can naturally be processed in parallel.  After processing, the balances of all the accounts are added to obtain the total balance. Just as traditional bookkeeping accounts for both balance information and flow information, the integration of the UTXO model and the account model provides information demanders with more complete, three-dimensional ledger information, and is becoming the current trend in the development of DLT ledgers.  UXTOs and bookkeeping  A systematic exposition on the principle of double-entry bookkeeping was first presented in 1494 by Luca Pacioli an Italian, in his paper ""Summary of arithmetic, geometry, proportions and proportionality.""  Double-entry bookkeeping is based on the equality between the asset amount and the amount of equity plus liability. It is a method of bookkeeping that, for every economic activity, records the corresponding changes in two or more linked accounts, thus systematically reflecting the result of fund movement.  A decrease in one account, there is an increase in another account, the debit and credit must equal. Taking capital as an example, the borrower is the receiver of funds, and the lender is the source of the funds.  If there is a spending of fund, the fund must come form somewhere. The ""debit equals credit"" means that the amount of the money spent equals the amount of the money deducted from the source. The double-entry bookkeeping method scientifically obtains important information on economic transactions and business results from relevant documents and creates a perfect bookkeeping methodology for the formation of modern enterprises and business society.  German philosopher Goethe praised it as ""one of the wonderful creations of human wisdom, every shrewd businessman engaged in business activities must take advantage of it.""  Interestingly, like traditional account processing, UTXO 's processing also includes a bookkeeping philosophy of ""A decrease in one account, there is an increase in another account, the debit and credit must equal."" The manifestation is that if UTXO has a transaction output, there should exist a transaction input, and if there is a transaction input, there should exist a transaction output.  The amount of transaction input should equal to the amount of transaction output, consistent with the connotation of, ""A decrease in one account, there is an increase in another account, the debit and credit must equal.""  DLT ledger improvements  With this context, we can examine the benefits of distributed ledgers.  Hard to forge, difficult to falsify, highly efficient, traceable and easy to auditTraditionally, both paper ledger and electronic ledger are easy to forge and falsify. And the accounting process from the original voucher to the accounting book is error-prone.The UTXO of blockchain technology is designed through sophisticated data structures such as hash functions, time stamps and Merkle trees, supplemented by cryptography and consensus algorithms, to achieve the unforgeability and immutability of historical transaction records, and uses algorithm functions (eg. ethereum's state transition function) to automatically calculate the account balance.The whole process is of high efficiency and with no error. The UTXO accounting model is also traceable and easy to audit.  Ensures consistency of distributed ledgers through transaction signatures, consensus algorithms and cross-chain technologies, and automatic completion of account-document matching, ledger matching, and account-reality matchingIt should be said that any entity has its right to perform bookkeeping and has its own account. And the same entity usually holds a variety of ledgers, for example, a company has cashier ledger, cash ledger, bank deposit ledger, inventory ledger, invoice ledger, operating expenses ledger, general ledgers, administrative expense ledger, accounts receivable ledger, fixed assets ledger, 17 column breakdown ledger, intangible assets ledger, paid-in capital ledger, etc.From this perspective, ledgers are always ""distributed"" and there is no so-called centralized ledger. Because ledgers are easy to be forged and falsified, the question how to protect and maintain the consistency of various ""distributed"" accounts has become the key point of accounting and auditing.  Traditionally, a reconciliation regime is used to achieve consistency of various distributed ledgers.  The account reconciliation refers to checking and collating the relevant data recorded on the ledgers and accounts, so as to achieve the matching between account and document, between different accounts, and between account and real amount. Matching between account and document means that the account records match the related account documents. Matching between accounts means various books, including various books of an entity, various books from different entities that have matching entries. Matching between account and reality mean that the account balance of various property goods matches the actual amount.  DLT first guarantees the matching account and document through transaction signatures. The account is the document and the document is the account. The two are consistent and difficult to tamper with.  Second, DLT achieves the matching of accounts of various entities through a consensus mechanism.  The transaction information is written into the shared ledger only when consensus is reached. Information written into the account must have been agreed by the entities and the accounts are automatically matched. In addition, DLT uses cross-chain protocols to carry out cash-cash transaction and cash-voucher redemption, which automatically accomplishes the account-reality reconciliation.  DLT ledger improvements  Cross-chain technology not only guarantees the atomicity of pay in cash-cash transactions and cash-voucher redemption, it also guarantees the consistency between the accounts of different cross-chain entities.  Cross-chain technology includes three types:  Notary schemes – This is a centralized or multi-signature-based witness model. The main feature is that it does not focus on the structure and consensus characteristics of the cross-chain, but instead introduces a trusted third party to act as a notary, acting as an intermediary for cross-chain operations.  Sidechains and relays – The side chain is a kind of chain structure anchored to the primary chain. It is not a fork of the primary chain, but extracts specific information from the data flow of the primary chain to form a new chain structure. Relay is a channel for cross-chain information exchange and delivery. Whether it is a side chain or a relay, data is collected from the primary chain and it plays the role of a listener.  Hash-locking technology – It sets an interoperable trigger between different chains, usually a hash value of a random number to be disclosed. The hash value is equivalent to a puzzle for currency transfer, and only those who get the secret random number can get the money. At the same time, it also constructed two ""redeem contracts,"" which need to be double-signed to become effective and have a time limit, in which the redeem contract for the person making the transfer hash puzzle is longer in duration than the other. One can thus protect his rights and interests.  It can be said that through specific single-chain and cross-chain bookkeeping technology, DLT ledger eliminates a lot of time-consuming, costly and error-prone reconciliation work. It automatically achieves the consistency of all kinds of ""distributed"" ledgers in real time.  Returning data rights to individuals  Traditionally, individual information of many participants has been ""marked out"" on various types of ledgers.  Especially with the development of digital economy, privacy protection of personal data is becoming more and more prominent. China's ""Cyber Security Law"" and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provide legal protection for data subject(owner) to enjoy such rights as the right to know, the right to access, the right to object others' access, the right to carry the data elsewhere, and the right to be forgotten, in order to strengthen personal privacy protection.  With the signature, encryption and other technical methods, DLT is truly able to return data rights back to individuals on a technical level.  By using cryptographic primitives and schemes such as zero-knowledge proof, homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, ring signature, group signature, hierarchical certificates, and coin shuffle, the privacy protection of transaction identities and contents can also be achieved.  Improving value of financial statement information  DLT ledgers are traceable, immutable and hard to be forged, which can guarantee the authenticity and reliability of financial statement information. Moreover, DLT ledgers can further enhance the value of financial statement information in the following aspects.  This can happen in three ways:  Improving the timeliness of financial statement information – Traditionally, account processing, recordkeeping, and reconciliation require costs. Therefore, based on the principle of cost-benefit, traditional accounting practices generally require one to create and disclose accounting statements on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis.This kind of financial statement is based on a periodic assumption that has serious time delay, which affects the timeliness of the financial information. Investors, creditors, financial analysts, business managers, and other entities that need such financial information make decisions continuously. They hope that they can obtain information needed at any time for decision-making.The timeliness of financial information is crucial.From the technical feasibility point of view, based on the DLT with automated execution, real-time accounting and achievable global consistency, instantaneous balance sheet generation has become possible. This may be an important innovation in financial accounting.Of course, some necessary preconditions are required. For example, the DLT ledger should have enough ubiquity to cover all types of accounting elements globally.  Improving the relevance of financial statement information – According to the principle of meeting demand, financial statements are designed to satisfy the information users' decision-making needs. Therefore, financial statement information should be relevant to the decision process of the information user.Compared with historical cost information, fair value information is more relevant.However, traditionally, due to the difficulty in achieving the timeliness of the preparation and disclosure of the aforementioned financial statements, one has to rely more or less on historical cost method, which impair the relevance of the financial information to the user's decision-making process.The use of DLT not only can achieve the reliability of financial information, but also can achieve the timeliness of the preparation of financial statements, making measurement based on fair value method more feasible, so as to better meet the needs of information users.  Improving the completeness of financial reporting. Similarly, because bookkeeping requires cost, based on the cost-benefit principle, traditional financial statements often selectively reflect information that is presumed to be useful or important to decision makers. Information users can only access the part of information about the company's business activities, rather than global information.DLT not only reduces accounting costs and improves efficiency, but also allows the user to penetrate to the bottom of the business operation and obtain complete information, thus improving decision-making efficiency. However, in this process, it may touch upon the information disclosure boundary between the relevant stakeholders' right to information and the company's need for protection of trade secrets, which needs further balancing.In addition, the acquisition of global information means the large-scale growth of information, and how to extract information value better becomes crucial. From this perspective, the integration of DLT with big data analysis, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other technologies will probably become the future direction of the ledger technology.  DLT for national ledgers  Although existing ledger technology can fully meet the economic needs, as the economic activities continue to evolve toward digitization and intelligence, the upgrading and transformation of traditional ledger technology will be inevitable.  As an emerging technology that is still developing, DLT is not necessarily a must-have item for future ledger technology. However, strengthening research and exploring its application in the generation of various types of ledgers are undoubtedly of practical significance.  In the modern economy, as government deepens its degree of economic participation, national balance sheet management is becoming increasingly important. The 1992 European currency crisis and the Mexican currency crisis from 1994 to 1995 indicate that serious sovereign country asset and liability maturity mismatches, currency mismatches, and fiscal deficits will trigger currency crises.  The outbreak of debt crisis in Europe and the U.S. is even more prominent.  Maintaining soundness of sovereign countries' balance sheets is particularly important for the effective response to financial crisis and for achieving speedy economic recovery  Not only that, the compilation and management of national balance sheets has become an important part of promoting the modernization of national governance systems and governance capabilities. June 26, 2017, The 36th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Comprehensive Deepening of Reform examined and adopted the ""working scheme of national and local government balance sheet generation.""  Results so far  It can be said that the national ledger is an important support for finding out what is the bottom line, revealing risks, and helping the country's governance. However, in the actual preparation process, it faces many challenges and difficulties. So far, only Canada has compiled the balance sheet of the local government, and other countries have not, which shows how difficult it is.  Among all the difficulties, the most fundamental issue is data collection.  National balance sheets require a large amount of basic data, high data quality and high technical requirements, and is difficult to implement.  For example, there are insufficient data and statistics; it involves a wide range of cross-agency cross-ministry, cross-industry, cross-regional transaction data, which is difficult to collect and aggregate. In this regard, DLT may have a role to play in making the preparation of the national accounts a reality.  Using blockchains to link natural resources, intangible assets, financial assets, and physical assets, and building a data sharing platform that breaks down various information barriers, unifies information entry, avoids a lot of duplicate work, and reduces the error rate of data validation. Data sharing, verification, and statistics among agencies, ministries, industries, and regions become more efficient.  Judging from the technical characteristics, each participant of the blockchain system is a remote multi-active node. It is an innate multi-active system and can achieve consistency of information across different ledgers through cross-chain technology, and it is suitable for a wide range of coverage.  DLT in financial accounts  The importance of comprehensive financial statistics is self-evident.  Accelerating the development of comprehensive financial statistics is the key information foundation to effectively monitor the effectiveness of the financial services for the real economy and to improve service efficiency. It is an urgent need to preemptively prevent and resolve systemic financial risks and safeguard financial stability. It is an important move to comprehensively deepening the reform of financial system and to establish a modern financial system.  On April 9, 2018, the State Council issued ""Opinions on Fully Promoting Financial Comprehensive Statistics Work"" to decisively deploy the comprehensive financial statics work, and made the request for a working mechanism of a unified standard, synchronous data capturing, centralized data validation, and aggregate data sharing.  Undoubtedly, from a technical point of view, DLT is more suitable for these four requirements and may become an infrastructure for comprehensive financial statistics.  Conclusion  Modernization of ledger technology is the foundation of modernization of corporate governance and even state governance. DLT has unique advantages and is expected to play an important role. Of course, it also has its shortcomings. For example, DLT is not scalable enough to meet requirements.  Data privacy and access control need to be improved. Integration of DLT into existing accounting systems still needs research. How to further applied it to generate various types of ledger requires further trial and error and exploration. Obviously, higher-level DLT ledger application is based on the maturity of lower-level application.  For example, it will be natural for DLT ledger to be applied at national and industry level when it is already widely used at enterprise level.  Therefore, attention should be paid to the scale effect and synergy effect of technology application, so as to release the positive energy of DLT ledger to the greatest extent.

According to The Indian Express, a sessions court in Ahmedabad granted an application from the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Monday to declare Nalin Kotadiya an absconder from justice. According to Indian law, can now be arrested by any resident and is banned from leaving the country.  The decision comes after Kotadiya – a former Member of Legislative Assembly – failed to appear in court despite repeated summonses and after the CID could not reach him with an arrest warrant.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Kotadiya's name surfaced when the CID started investigating the case in which businessman Shailash Bhatt accused 10 policemen of extorting 200 bitcoin (then worth around $1.7 million) from him by force in February.  According to the new report, Kotadiya is believed by the CID to have helped the police officers kidnap Bhatt.  In an intriguing twist to the tale, the CID is also accusing the apparent victim, Bhatt, and an associate, Kirit Paladiya, of extorting around $22 million – including cash and over 2,000 bitcoin – at gunpoint from a member of BitConnect, an alleged bitcoin Ponzi scheme which reportedly closed in India in January.

42380880,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX90c83,1529401513,$7k? Bitcoin Price Looks North After Six-Day High,"Despite the bearish chart setup, bitcoin (BTC) rose to a six-day high on Monday, putting a corrective rally to $7,000 back on the map.  The leading cryptocurrency unexpectedly picked up a bid around $6,450 at 16:00 UTC yesterday and rose to $6,850 – the highest level since June 12, according to Bitfinex data.  The $400 rally may have trapped a few bears on the wrong side of the market, given the pennant breakdown on the 4-hour chart had called for a drop to $6,000.  Yesterday's gravity-defying price action in BTC has boosted the odds of a rally to $7,024 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $9,990 to $6,108). However, the long-run outlook remains bearish for now.  At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $6,700 on Bitfinex.  4-hour chart  As seen in the chart above, the 4-hour candle crossed the upper Bollinger band in a convincing manner yesterday, signaling a bullish Bollinger band (standard deviation of +2 and -2 on 20-candle moving average) breakout.  Trading volume also picked up (circled on chart), adding credence to the bullish move. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has also found acceptance above the 50-candle moving average (MA) and the relative strength index (RSI) is biased bullish (above 50.00).  So, BTC will likely clear the immediate resistance at $6,736 (yellow dotted line) and test supply around $7,024 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $9,990 to $6,108) in the next 24 hours.  It's worth noting that the descending (bearish) 100-candle MA is located at $7,045, marking a key resistance level for the bulls.  The positive Bollinger band setup also validates the argument put forward by the bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence last week that the cryptocurrency has found a temporary low at around $6,100.  Daily chart        BTC closed above the 10-day MA yesterday, invalidating the immediate bearish outlook. It also created a bullish outside-day candle on Monday (price action engulfed Sunday's high and low) – that is, the day began on a pessimistic note, but ended optimistically. Thus, the probability that the corrective rally will gather traction is high.  View  BTC looks set to take out immediate resistance at $6,736 and rally towards $7,024 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $9,990 to $6,108).  A daily close (as per UTC) above that level would open the doors to $7,500–$7,600, although the rally could be short-lived as the long-run technicals are still biased to the bears.  Bearish scenario: A sell-off to $6,000 could still happen this week, if BTC closes (as per UTC) below the 10-day MA ($6,582) today.

42380876,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX90c0V,1529398819,Major Crypto Exchanges Face Action Over Money-Laundering Fears,"Japan's financial watchdog is reportedly planning to force improvements at a number of licensed cryptocurrency exchanges over perceived issues with internal systems, including anti-money laundering (AML) measures.  According to a report from Nikkei on Tuesday, the country's Financial Service Agency (FSA) intends to ensure full compliance with current AML rules at larger exchanges as their holdings of customer funds rapidly increases. The report suggests at least five exchanges, including bitFlyer, Quoine, and Bitbank, are on the FSA's list to receive ""business improvement orders"" this week.  The report said that, based on its recent inspections, the FSA found that some licensed exchanges still do not have sufficient measures in place for spotting suspicious transactions. Further, the agency is also concerned that the firms have not recruited enough staff to cope with the growing volume of transactions on their platforms.  Back in April, the FSA was already raising questions over what it considered a loosely enforced ID-verification process at bitFlyer, after which the firm pledged it would strengthen its procedures.  The agency also issued business improvement orders in March to a number of registered but lesser known cryptocurrency exchanges – including GMO Coin and Tech Bureau – as part of its review of crypto trading platforms following the $530 million Coincheck hack in January.  And, earlier this month, the FSA gave its first-ever license rejection to cryptocurrency exchange FSHO after having issued two suspension orders to the firm over its alleged failure to properly implement security and AML improvements.  The latest move by the FSA comes just days after a Japanese self-regulatory group of cryptocurrency exchanges proposed to strengthen their AML measures by prohibiting member platforms from listing anonymous cryptocurrencies such as monero and dash.

42380867,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX90brh,1529395235,Central Banks Will Jump-Start the Decentralization of Money,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Whether bitcoin or its imitators eventually achieve global ubiquity, they have already achieved success in one fundamental way: forcing humans to rethink their relationship with money and banks.  Cryptocurrencies weren't on the ballot during Switzerland's ""sovereign money"" referendum last weekend, in which Swiss citizens rejected by a ratio of three to one a proposal to end fractional reserve banking and give sole money-creation authority to the Swiss National Bank. But they were the elephant in the room.  The very presence of the crypto alternative, I believe, will eventually force economies worldwide to disintermediate banks from money, yet the direct authors of that change won't be activist voters wielding ill-conceived referenda or crypto enthusiasts voting with their wallets.  The first phase of a transition toward a true ""money of the people"" will be implemented by central banks themselves, striving and competing to remain relevant in a post-crisis, post-trust, digitally connected global economy.  That might disappoint adherents of the cypherpunk dream who birthed bitcoin. But the good news for those who want governments out of money altogether is that when currencies become digital – and enjoy all the bells and whistles of programmable money – they will foster more intense global competition among themselves.  When smart contracts can manage exchange rate volatility, for example, people and businesses involved in international trade will not need to rely solely on the dollar as the cross-border currency of choice. This more competitive environment will ultimately open the door to non-government digital alternatives such a bitcoin.  Backlash against CBDCs  To be sure, official enthusiasm for central bank-issued digital currency, or CBDC as it has become known, has waned somewhat as the old guard of central banking has dug in its heels.  At the Bank of England, which spearheaded research into the idea three years ago, Governor Mark Carney has lately warned of financial instability if his institution were to directly provide digital wallets to ordinary citizens -- a change that would, in effect, give everyone the same right to hold reserves at the central bank as regulated commercial banks.  The Bank of International Settlements – a kind of international club for central banks – has echoed Carney's concerns, as have other officials.  This backlash, which suggests that the bank supervisory teams within central bank bureaucracies have regained ascendancy over technologists and innovators in their internal debates over CBDC, stems from a well-founded expectation: bank runs would be a real possibility.  Why hold your money at risky, friction-laden institutions paying near-zero interest when you can store at zero risk with the central bank itself and trade it automatically with other fiat digital wallet holders?  But why, also, should we care what happens to banks?  Banks are the problem  The only reason to promote digital fiat currencies is precisely to bypass the banks. Whether the currency is fiat or decentralized, banks are the problem. The technical, social and regulatory infrastructure upon which they operate is decades old and fraught with unnecessary compliance costs.  Banks maintain centralized, non-interoperable databases on outdated, clunky COBOL mainframes. They rely on multiple intermediaries to process payments, each managing their own, siloed ledgers that must be reconciled against each other through time-consuming fraud-prevention mechanisms.  All these inefficient systems, instituted to address the problem of trust, merely add to the cost of trust in the system.  ""Why, in a digital age, can't we move money around 24/7? Because we have bad middleware, and that bad middleware is existing financial infrastructure,"" says Charles Cascarilla, CEO of Paxos, which is building blockchain-based trading infrastructure for the financial system.  In addition, there's the massive political risk that comes with banks' involvement in our payments system.  The reason why it was deemed necessary for governments to bail out the world's banks to the tune of trillions of dollars in 2008 was that not doing so would have thrust our highly complex payments systems into chaos. The global economy would have had a cardiac arrest. It's that threat of bringing us all down with them that gives ""too-big-to-fail"" banks a hold over policymaking.  Many central bankers, still smarting from the fallout from that crisis, know this is the problem. Many see real benefits in removing banks from payments and recognize that digital currencies can help. The question is how to get there without fomenting chaos.  Gradual solutions  One solution: a phased approach over time. You don't provide CBDC to everyone at first; you start with large non-bank financial institutions, follow it up with a certain class of large corporations, then move to smaller businesses, and only make it available to individuals as a last step.  Another solution: the introduction of a unique, central bank-determined CBDC interest rate. This would be an addition to the central bank toolkit for managing money supply, which currently hinges on a combination of a policy rate imposed on banks' reserves and interventions in the two-way market for buying and selling government securities with banks.  A separate CBDC interest rate would provide a means to calibrate the flow of money between banks and digital fiat wallets, potentially within a long-term plan to gradually shift it from the former to the latter without overly disrupting the system.  As Sheila Bair, the former Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., argued in a recent op-ed, this new interest rate tool could enhance monetary policy, as central banks could use it to either stimulate or cool the economy. By directly affecting the rate at which people's currency holdings grow, incentives to save or spend could be directly implemented.  Still, I don't see developed-world central banks rushing to do this. Their relationships to commercial banks are too entrenched. And, for now at least, it's hard for many in that system to even conceive of a monetary system that doesn't revolve around them.  But it's different for developing-world central banks. For too long those countries' monetary policy has been driven by the policies of the world's biggest central bank, the Federal Reserve. If the Fed cuts rates, foreign, inflationary money floods into their bank-centric financial systems; if it hikes rates, they face deflationary risks. In theory, a fiat digital currency could allow them to offset those forces.  Now, of course, all of this could go wrong. A new tool for profligate governments to debase their citizens' money does not look desirable. For proof, look no further than the rogue state of Venezuela and its new, centrally controlled digital currency, the petro.  Yet that may also be what ultimately gives bitcoin, or some other viable altcoin, a chance to shine, especially as Layer 2 solutions start to help with scalability and liquidity. Central banks can't put the cryptocurrency genie back in the bottle. Their potential embrace of digital fiat currencies will happen in an era when their citizens have a choice – they can shift to these new decentralized solutions, with increasing ease.  Whether they take over the world or not, the power of the market in a more open system of currency choice will mean that cryptocurrencies will hopefully play a vital role in forcing these politicized, centralized institutions to better manage their people's money.

42380866,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX90bqR,1529388001,Internet Cafes Hacked to Mine $800k in Siacoin Cryptocurrency,"A group of hackers has allegedly colluded with computer maintenance firms in China to hack into computers owned by internet cafes to mine cryptocurrency.  According to a local news report on Saturday, police in Rui'An city in Zhejiang province arrested 16 suspects who, it's claimed, have gained 5 million yuan ($800,000) by hacking more than 100,000 computers in internet cafes across 30 Chinese cities since July of last year.  The report said the hackers first developed a piece of malware that can specifically mine the siacoin cryptocurrency on an affected device, then marketed it to computer maintenance firms who allegedly helped to inject the malware to computers at internet cafes whilst carrying out routine checkups.  The profits made by mining and selling the siacoins would then be split among the hackers and their alleged accomplices, the report said.  The issue emerged in July 2017 when internet cafes in Rui'An started to notice their computers had become extremely slow, since the CPU usage rate was often at 70 percent even after a restart.  Notably, it was also at a time when the price of siacoin jumped by 400 percent from $0.002 in May to over $0.01 in July, data from CoinMarketCap shows.  Meanwhile, the utility bills of the affected internet cafes in Rui'An also went up significantly during that period, the report said. Subsequently the owners reported the case to the local police.  Since most internet cafes in Rui'An used the same computer maintenance firm (which was unnamed in the report), the police arrested the firm's chief executive officer in August, who later revealed information on the hackers.  Currently, the investigation is still ongoing, since the malware has now spread across more than 30 cities in China, with over 100 computer maintenance firms in the country being allegedly involved.

42380870,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX90buD,1529380282,One Mathematician's Mission to Boost Bitcoin's Privacy (And Soon),"Have modern internet companies gone too far?  According to mathematician and Blockstream research director, Andrew Poelstra, the answer is unequivocally yes. In his view, companies are simply now vacuuming up troves of customer data, which they then sell to others without the owner's knowledge or benefit. (Think how Instagram owns user images, or Target acquires huge amounts of data on what products people buy).  Not just a bad deal for customers, though, security experts even worry that with all this data, AI systems will be able to predict what a person will do next by following data trails, conjuring up concerns about real-life dystopias like those of sci-fi books and movies.  As such, Poelstra is using his two passions – math and bitcoin – to try to bring added privacy to online money.  To this end, Poelstra has been tinkering away, formulating mathematical equations and writing code, to hide bitcoin's ""trails."" Trails being the traces of personal information – who you are, what you buy, for how much – that can be gleaned when transacting online when using bitcoin.  Because the world's first cryptocurrency rides on a public ledger, users who aren't especially careful can leave traces for all with an internet connection to see.  ""Those trails that no one thinks about, I wish that they weren't there,"" Poelstra told CoinDesk, adding:  ""I would hope I'm not leaving one and I would hope that no one that I love is leaving one. That's who I'm working for.""  And that statement might just reveal Poelstra's true mission.  Unlike many privacy advocates, who to describe the point of creating a private money system typically point to extremes, Poelstra isn't focused on these edge cases, he's focused on his friends and family.  Speaking during a panel at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference, he summed up his outlook stating, ""I think about myself, not people who are really in any extreme turmoil or instability.""  Scriptless scripts  Poelstra's recent work revolves around a project called ""scriptless scripts,"" which allow for bitcoin smart contracts that don't use so much data.  More complex smart contracts can sometimes require more storage, so while they offer the ability to perform more complicated transaction types, they've become a key hurdle for smart contracts platforms.  One popular cryptocurrency project, mimblewimble, has struggled with this exact tradeoff. In creating a protocol that improved upon bitcoin's scale and privacy limitations, it was thought mimblewimble might be unable to support more complex transactions through smart contracts. So Poelstra, not convinced it was impossible, put his interest in math to work on this issue, and came out with scriptless scripts.  ""Then I realized there's no reason to do this in mimblewimble. You can do it in bitcoin,"" he told CoinDesk.  On top of the smart contract benefits for mimblewimble, the concept also has scalability and privacy advantages for the longest-running and largest cryptocurrency.  According to Poelstra, scriptless scripts can help improve the privacy of lightning payments, those that take place on bitcoin's layer-two scaling technology that pushes transactions off the blockchain.  ""With it, you no longer need to publish to the world all the details of your payment channels,"" Poelstra said.  And all this work could come to fruition sooner than many might expect.  Scriptless scripts are just a couple steps away. They merely require Schnorr signatures, a technology pioneered (for bitcoin at least) by veteran developer Pieter Wuille – which Poelstra has also contributed to – to be implemented and voted on and approved by bitcoin users.  But Poelstra believes this technology will only really have the biggest effect on privacy by being joined by other technology.  For instance, Poelstra would like to see the recently unveiled and much-applauded Taproot, which was created by long-time bitcoin core contributor Greg Maxwell, also implemented.  In that, the lightning network would get even more private, since it makes all bitcoin transactions look the same – so people wouldn't be able to tell the difference between on-chain and lightning's off-chain transactions.  ""That is, the user does not even need to reveal that she is using payment channels at all!"" Poelstra said.  Minor changes  But all these various small code changes seem like a slow, patchwork way of making bitcoin private. Instead, why can't developers just do something big and all-encompassing?  According to Jameson Lopp, an engineer at key management startup Casa, ""There's no silver bulletproof for fixing cryptocurrency privacy problems.""  Poelstra echoed that, saying that no one's so far been able to wave a magic wand and suddenly create a completely private cryptocurrency without any downsides. One particularly stubborn trade-off is scalability.  But Poelstra is also working on this as well in a recently unveiled breakthrough he's been contributing to called bulletproofs. In short, bulletproofs helps to decrease the size of another privacy technology called confidential transactions, which is a cryptographic way of shielding bitcoin user balances.  The size of these transactions is the main thing holding back the long-in-the-making privacy technology, so bulletproof's reduction is important.  But even with this breakthrough, the transactions are still not small enough.  ""I can't see it ever getting enough community support because of scalability,"" Poelstra said.  Not only that but confidential transactions only shield bitcoin balances, and do not hide the other various parts of a transactions – like where a transaction came from and who the sender and receiver are.  That's why Poelstra is only one technologist taking on this thorny problem.  Developers of the core protocol, but also technologists in other areas, such as wallet developers are all working on privacy-enhancing technologies for users.  And because that's happening today, Poelstra thinks there's a ""whole pile"" of other promising ways to shield various pieces of bitcoin.
