42425215,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvU7h,1387966506,Reserve Bank of India Issues Virtual Currency Warning,"On Tuesday the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a statement warning the public against the use of virtual currencies. The bank cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security-related risks they are exposing themselves to.  The bank pointed out that it has been keeping a close eye on developments in the virtual currency world, including bitcoins, litecoins, bbqcoins, dogecoins and other altcoins.  “The creation, trading or usage of VCs including Bitcoins, as a medium for payment are not authorised by any central bank or monetary authority. No regulatory approvals, registration or authorisation is stated to have been obtained by the entities concerned for carrying on such activities.”  RBI outlines digital currency risks  The RBI outlined several potential risks related to digital currencies, echoing warnings issued by several central banks and national regulators over the last few weeks. The bank specifically identified the following risks:  Digital currency stored in wallets is prone to theft and loss via misuse or malicious intent, ranging from loss of password, hacking, malware and compromised access credentials. “Since they are not created by or traded through any authorised central registry or agency, the loss of the e-wallet could result in the permanent loss of the virtual currencies held in them,” the RBI said.  Payments and transactions handled in digital currencies take place on a peer-to-peer basis without an authorised central agency to regulate such payments. Therefore there is no established framework for recourse to customer problems / disputes / chargebacks etc.  There is no underlying value or backing for digital currencies. As they lack intrinsic value, the bank warns that their value is a “matter of speculation.” The bank adds that huge volatility in value exposes users to potential losses.  Exchange platforms are set up in various jurisdictions and in many cases their legal status is unclear. This means users of such platforms are exposed to potential legal as well as financial risks.  The RBI also pointed out that there have been “several media reports” on the usage of digital currencies for illicit and illegal activities in several jurisdictions.  “The absence of information of counterparties in such peer-to-peer anonymous/ pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws,” the bank warned.  Potential implications  The Reserve Bank of India says it is in the process of examining issues associated with digital currencies, including usage, holding and trading of virtual currencies under India’s existing regulatory framework. Applicable legislation includes foreign exchange and payment systems laws and regulations.  There are a few exchanges and trading platforms in India and most of them were launched earlier this year. Although they tend to allow users to purchase bitcoin in rupees, none of them appear to have regulatory approval to do so. However, since India does not have digital currency legislation, it is impossible to get such approval, unless Indian regulators decide to apply existing foreign exchange regulations to bitcoin.  For now though, India does not have bitcoin regulation and it is unclear whether the RBI’s statement will change anything moving forward.

42425226,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvUVh,1387964415,Check Out These 5 Cool Items of Bitcoin Merchandise,"With bitcoin now hotter than ever, there's no shortage of ways to associate yourself with the cryptocurrency through related merchandise and paraphernalia. Whether for your personal use or as a gift to a loved one who understands the benefits of the digital currency this holiday season, here's our list of five cool types of bitcoin merch:  1. Mega Hash energy drink  Bitcoin mining  is hard work. The miner has to stay laser-focused on the task at hand amidst the drone of cooling fans and the stress from the unpredictable spikes and dips in the CoinDesk BPI. Intrepid miners can now turn to specialist nutrition to maintain their levels of concentration: A German bitcoiner has developed an energy drink that is specially formulated, with tongue firmly in cheek, for a ""hot day at the mine"".  The energy drink is named Mega Hash. Its makers claim that it will help bitcoiners harness ""the power of the network"". The post promoting the drink on Bitcoin Talk rhapsodises about the drink's taste:  ""Mega Hash tastes invigorating, like 'future', 'move' and 'independence'! The best way to enjoy Mega hash is ice-cold. For example, on a hot day in the mine.""  According to Mega Hash's producer, the drink's taste roughly translates to that of popular energy drinks.  ""It tastes very similar to Red Bull,"" Mega Hash's maker posted, in reply to a question asking about the drink's flavour.  The Mega Hash ingredients list includes 50% whey powder, a dose of taurine, an organic acid that's also found in Red Bull; some caffeine and even a number of vitamins. A can of Mega Hash will set you back €1.59, while a six pack costs €8.99. A 'mega pack' of the stuff is priced at €31.99. Shipping ranges from €1.90 to €36.90.  2. Bitcoin Miner flask  There are many ways to express your belief in an mathematically mined cryptocurrency with no central authority. One of those ways is to swig beverages from an appropriately designed hip flask. At the eBay store 'yourwholesaleheadquarters', you can choose from several bitcoin-themed hip flasks made of 8oz stainless steel.  Select the 'Bitcoin Miner' flask, which features the outline of a pick-axe apparently dislodging some bitcoin in the depths of a mine, or the white-on-black 'Keep Calm and Mine Bitcoin' tumbler, which also includes the orange bitcoin symbol. Or perhaps the more straightforward 'Bitcoin' flask, which features the bitcoin symbol rendered in gold, speaks to you more directly. Whatever your decision, know that each flask design is professionally printed on high-quality UV-coated vinyl at a cost of $14.95 each.  3. Cryptocables neon bitcoin sign  Have you ever felt the urge to advertise that your business, or you personally, accept bitcoins, loudly and in neon? If so, you're in luck, because some absolutely gorgeous neon bitcoin signs are available for purchase.  The neon bitcoin signs are made by a company called Cryptocables, and more specifically, by someone who goes by the name of Crypt0queen. Crypt0queen designed and commissioned a set of neon bitcoin signs after a series of posts on Bitcoin Talk soliciting feedback and responses for everything from design details to pricing.  The result of Crypt0queen's community consultation was the first version of the neon bitcoin sign: two concentric circles of orange and yellow surrounding the bitcoin symbol with the legend 'accepted here' below it. This version started shipping in late September. The sign proved so popular — half the inventory was sold within a day — that a new version will be available for delivery next January.  The second iteration of the neon bitcoin sign will feature the additional script 'bitcoin' above the concentric circles. The new version is slightly taller (at 73cm compared to 65cm) but shares the same 50cm width and comes with a USA standard UL plug like its predecessor. It requires a 120 volt power outlet and are rated at 65.5 watts. The new sign costs $325.  In case the original neon bitcoin sign tickles your fancy, look out for units floating around eBay. The original retailed for $225. The one CoinDesk found has a Buy It Now price of $545 with an additional, eye-watering, $679 shipping fee. Unfortunately for the true bitcoin believer, this seller will only take payment from a verified PayPal account.  Cryptocables also sells a tabletop 'Bitcoin Accepted Here' sign that lights up with a white LED for $49.99 and rubber bracelets (think 'Livestrong') emblazoned with bitcoin-supporting slogans like 'We Love Bitcoin' for $3.50 each.  4. Bitcoin wallet QR code T-shirt  A bitcoin wallet isn't being fully utilised until its address is exhibited on your torso for the public to see. Ebayer americanbitcoin will send you a T-shirt with the slogan 'I Love Bitcoins' printed across the chest and your wallet address embedded in a QR code under it for $25. If you're feeling slightly less sanguine towards fiat currency-loving society in general, you can also opt for the 'Bit Me!' slogan shirt, which is also replete with QR code and wallet address.  One satisfied customer who bought a 'Bit Me!' T-shirt recently left this glowing review of the product:  ""Very comfortable, the QR scan works! Amazing T-shirt. Highly recommend!'  5. Precious metal bitcoin rings  If only your love of bitcoin could somehow be expressed constantly through an article of jewelry wrought of precious metal. Well, that's exactly what you can do with these bitcoin rings available in silver or brass that's been plated in 22-carat gold.  A Bitcoin Talk user named goebat designed two rings featuring the bitcoin symbol as its bezel. The difference between the two designs appears to be the hoop, which is relatively thicker on one design. The rings are manufactured by Shapeways, a platform that turns user-submitted designs into physical objects using 3D printers.  The bitcoin rings are available in four precious metal configurations: two types of sterling silver, gold-plated brass and brass. All the precious metal rings are hand polished, according to Shapeways. The rings are also available in a series of other metallic configurations, including bronze-infused stainless steel, mechanically polished sterling silver and steel that has been ""enrobed"" in 24-carat gold. The most expensive ring, in sterling silver, costs €82.46 and the cheapest ring in 'matte bronze steel' costs €19.43.  Goebat sold his first ring in June 2011 through an auction on Bitcoin Hop. One of the issues with buying the bitcoin rings is that Shapeways doesn't accept the cryptocurrency. If you want to pay in bitcoin for this fine piece of jewelry, you'll have to send goebat a message on Bitcoin Talk. The designer is currently looking for distributors who would resell the rings for the digital currency instead of fiat currency.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/25/check-out-these-5-cool-items-of-bitcoin-merchandise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff8e8039df44ea3986ca5b588083bb73db0c783d-700x393.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
