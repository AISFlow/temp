42399765,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyduK,1492465578,Traders Raise Concern as Biggest Bitcoin Exchange Halts Deposits,"An announcement by one of the world's largest bitcoin exchanges has stoked fears another Mt Gox-style meltdown may be brewing.  The largest bitcoin exchange by US dollar volume in recent weeks, Bitfinex revealed today it will be unable to accept incoming wires starting tomorrow, a statement that comes after it disclosed late last week that it was experiencing delays in US dollar withdrawals.  The exchange said in a statement today:  ""Beginning 18th April, all incoming wires to Bitfinex will be blocked and refused by our Taiwan banks. This applies to all fiat currencies at the present time.""  Notably, Bitfinex didn't offer any details as to why the banks – the subject of a previous wire transfer dispute that began earlier this month – will not accept the transfers. (The exchange ultimately went to court over the decision, but withdrew its lawsuit one week later.)  While Bitfinex is said to now be working on solutions to its banking issues, market observers are suggesting cause for concern.  Jacob Eliosoff, cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to the general reaction that this situation has so far provoked, discussing how the resulting freeze in withdrawals could create abnormal pressures in the market.  ""This is a dynamic many of us remember from the Mt Gox days when there were problems with fiat withdrawals,"" he said. ""Investors responded by converting fiat they had on the exchange to bitcoin so they could withdraw it. [In other words], they buy bitcoin to withdraw, pushing up the price on the exchange.""  Eliosoff went so far as to state that some market observers could perhaps view this as an opportunity for arbitrage, using it as an excuse to deposit bitcoin in order to sell at the high price and buy the bitcoin back again.  Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, provided a similar sentiment.  ""The hiatus [of] Bitfinex's banking facilities have led to a rush by some to extricate their bitcoin from the exchanges,"" he told CoinDesk.  Widening exchange spreads  Because of these developments, exchange spreads have widened, with Bitfinex enjoying a more than $50 premium in some cases at the time of report, according to data from CryptoCompare.  Bitcoin was trading at roughly $1,235 at 18:55 UTC on Bitfinex, compared to roughly $1,185 on Bitstamp and $1,190 on GDAX.  The spread harkens back to the final days of Mt Gox, when data showed the exchange consistently traded between 10% and 26% above its competitors.  While analysts voiced their concerns, they were optimistic that Bitfinex would emerge from this situation unscathed.  The victim of a hack last August, Bitfinex has shown a propensity to bounce back from operational difficulties. After losing nearly $65m in customer funds, it would go on to ""socialize"" losses among exchange users, using a new cryptographic token to credit customers.  The system would later win praise from supporters, who saw it as a creative way to avoid bankruptcy and pay back users.  Hayter offered similar input, emphasizing that Bitfinex has a ""solid"" reputation. ""The hope is this will be dealt with in a timely and professional manner,"" he said.  Eliosoff concluded:  ""The big picture here is that these operational hiccups are still common in the space.""

Tom Jessop is joining the firm after serving as Goldman's managing director for business technology development since January 2016, according to LinkedIn.  Between 2008 and 2012, he served as managing director for principal strategic investments, serving stints in Hong Kong and New York. He served as a vice president for the Wall Street investment bank between 2000 and 2008. Prior to working for Goldman Sachs, worked for credit ratings firm Standard & Poor’s.  According to Chain, Jessop will be chiefly responsible for pursuing commercial opportunities for the firm.  He said in a statement:  ""I am excited to collaborate with Chain's team, customers, and strategic partners to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology in financial services and other industries.""  Jessop is far from the first Goldmanite to head for the blockchain space.  Earlier this year, a former Sachs vice president sought to take on the traditional hedge fund concept using blockchain. And in early 2016, the Blythe Masters-led Digital Asset Holdings tapped another ex-VP to serve as a senior software developer. The digital currency exchange space has also attracted veterans of the firm over the years.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Chain.

42399754,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydjV,1492453809,India's Bitcoin Startups Speak Out As Government Debates New Rules,"A group of local bitcoin and blockchain businesses has a message for India’s government: hear us out.  Last week, India revealed that it has convened a special committee that will develop and report back on possible regulatory approaches to the tech. The country’s central bank and several government departments, including its main tax authority, are taking part.  In new statements, the Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India – formed earlier this year to represent the domestic industry’s interests – says it wants to play a role in those discussions. Members include bitcoin exchanges Unocoin and Coinsecure, as well as wallet service Zebpay and online search startup Searchtrade.  The group says it wants to meet with the committee, explaining in a statement:  ""We request the committee to give us an opportunity to meet them and showcase the benefits of this technology for our country. Financial inclusion, cheaper cross-border remittance, full trace and track on the movement of value on the blockchain network, and the potential for India to become a financial hub are key benefits that can be derived using virtual currencies.""  As for what position the Indian government might fully adopt, outside observers will just have to wait and see.  More than three years ago, the Reserve Bank of India issued a warning to domestic consumers about the risks involved in buying digital currencies. The central bank has issued updated versions of that warning, most recently earlier this year – sparking concerns that the government was about to ban bitcoin.

42399758,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydlT,1492444210,Ethereum Developers Eye Proof-of-Stake Shift with New Geth Update,"The team behind ethereum’s most popular user client have released a new update that includes support for alternative consensus systems.  Late last week, the developers behind Geth unveiled version 1.6, featuring support for a ""plugable consensus model"" in anticipation of ethereum’s shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.  In the past year and a half, the project has been laying the groundwork to move away from proof-of-work – also utilized in other public blockchains like bitcoin – as part of a broader evolution of ethereum. In recent days, developers have also hinted at momentum towards Metropolis, the next version of ethereum.  The goal, according to the post, is to create the conditions for developers who are looking to stand up ethereum networks that utilize different consensus models, such as proof-of-stake.  The team explained:  ""The result is that Geth 1.6 features a plugable consensus model where developers, wanting to roll their own fork of ethereum with wildly different ways of agreeing on block validity, can now do so by implementing a simple Go consensus engine interface. The current ethash backed proof-of-work consensus model is also “just” another implementation of this interface.""  The release also notably includes a tool called 'Puppeth', which, according to the post, allows a more streamlined process for standing up new ethereum networks. While not applicable in every instance, the team said the tool can help take out some of the heavier lifting involved.  ""Puppeth is not a magic bullet. If you have large in-house ethereum deployments based on your own orchestration tools, it’s always better to use existing infrastructure,"" the blog post explained, concluding:  ""However, if you need to create your own ethereum network without the fuss, Puppeth might actually help you do that… fast.""

42399750,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyddb,1492436156,CME Patent Sees Derivatives Opportunity in Bitcoin Mining,"Derivatives giant CME Group is looking to patent a way for bitcoin miners to hedge against operational risks.  As detailed in a patent application published last week by the US Patent and Trademark Office, the proposed system would receive data from the bitcoin network as a means of keeping contracts up to date – monitoring metrics like network difficulty and price.  CME previously launched a pair of bitcoin price indexes last year.  The filing is notable as bitcoin mining, the process by which new transactions are added to the bitcoin blockchain, is a kind of commodities production. Miners expend energy and manpower in exchange for newly minted bitcoins.  Yet, the ever-rising difficulty of mining can mean ever-encroaching costs for for miners.  With the mining derivative, ""a miner can lock in a projected growth rate of the difficulty factor"", the patent filing reads.  The application goes on to explain:  ""If the network hash rate grows faster than anticipated, the income from mining may fall, but the variation and settlement of the futures or the funds received by exercising a cash-settled call option contract would cover the loss. On the other hand, if the difficulty factor grows more slowly than anticipated or falls, the contract would lose value or the call option premium would expire as worthless, but a miner would make more money than expected on mining operations.""  Per the application, CME envisions the bitcoin mining derivative as a way to position against the depreciation of mining hardware as well.  ""...as the difficulty factor rises, mining computers may become less marketable, so taking a long position in the generated contract, or being long a call option on the generated contract, would allow manufacturers to lock in a projected growth rate of the difficulty factor and hedge against the risk of falling hardware prices,"" CME continues.  CME first applied for the patent on 13th October, 2015. Mansoor Ahmed, Ryan Pierce and Sandra Ro are listed as inventors.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, in which CME Group is an investor.

42399759,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydoQ,1492434004,Top US Business Schools Are Racing to Incorporate Blockchain,"Top US business schools are working to incorporate blockchain and cryptography into curriculums to meet evolving employer and student demands.  As commerce and finance become more digitized, schools say they are experiencing pressure from all angles to graduate students skilled in data science areas such as blockchain, while demand for the traditional MBA skill set subsides.  The shift is being driven by the changing nature of the Wall Street and consulting jobs that MBA graduates have traditionally assumed, as well as organically evolving interests among students.  David Yermack, finance department chair at New York University's Stern School of Business, who began teaching a course on digital currencies and blockchains in 2014, explained that the reason for this shift is that Wall Street jobs are changing.  ""They really aren’t hiring generic MBAs or finance MBAs – they are hiring data scientists,"" he said.  Yermack told CoinDesk:  ""The result is that our students don't want to take generic MBA courses on classical finance topics. We have courses like futures and options where the enrollment has really dropped like a stone.""  While NYU is a finance-oriented institution, technology firms like Amazon have surpassed traditional Wall Street titans like Citigroup as the leading recruiters of his students, he explained.  Campbell Harvey, who teaches an innovation and crypto-ventures course at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, explained that having even a working knowledge of blockchain can be a powerful tool for career advancement.  ""After taking this course, you can quickly tell if somebody doesn't really know about blockchain. If this happens within their job, this all of a sudden really gives them some leverage,"" Harvey said.  He cited a former student who quickly rose through the ranks of his company because he was well-versed in the subject.  Packing the seats  In addition to employer demands, organic shifts in student interest were also cited by the schools surveyed for this article as key drivers behind their efforts to introduce blockchain offerings.  ""What the students want is a glimpse of the future,"" said Harvey. ""If they can get that, that gives them a lot power in terms of being able to generate new ideas and an advantage over their competitors.""  Harvey said that his course began in 2014 with a mix of 13 business, law and computer science students. Now, the 75-seat class is filled up instantly by second-year MBAs.  ""It basically sold out in minutes,"" he said.  Bhagwan Chowdry – known for his publicized nomination of bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Economics – began teaching the first-ever blockchain course at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management course earlier this month and was surprised to see his roster and waitlist quickly fill to capacity.  His objectives are to help students establish a foundational knowledge of blockchain, communicate with technologists and ultimately be able to distinguish the wheat from the chaff.  ""We want the technology people to tell us honestly what is just hype,"" he said. ""We hear that these things are unbreakable and then there’s a hack. So, we want an honest assessment of what's feasible and what actually requires development.""  Fintech plus  Other top schools are packaging blockchain as part of broader financial technology initiatives.  Reena Aggarwal, director of the Center for Financial Markets and Policy at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, said that her school recently reached the tipping point of student interest to begin exploring ways of incorporating blockchain into its fintech program, which focuses on the nexus of business, policy and regulation.  Georgetown also played host to the 2nd Annual DC Blockchain Summit in March, which was hosted by the Chamber of Digital Commerce.  The University of California-Berkeley’s Haas School of Business is also offering courses that examine blockchain into broader fintech areas, such as mobile payments.  “Some of the aspects of the technological innovation that we're seeing have very, very different patterns and require somewhat different logic from the management side than traditional brick-and-mortar type businesses,” said Christine Parlour, chair of finance and accounting at the school.  The schools see their role as facilitating greater understanding of the business applications of blockchain, and stress that such knowledge is essential for the technology to fully realize its potential.  “If you want to build a process or system that’s eventually going to have an extremely large payoff, you have to understand how it fits into the economy and whether or not it can grow,"" said Parlour.  Others insist that business schools need to help build greater synergy and a higher baseline of communication between the technical and operational sides of the blockchain community.  “The dialogue between the technologists and the policymakers and those who actually make stuff happen has to take place at a reasonably serious level,” said UCLA’s Chowdry, casting off visions of a crypto-libertarian utopia as science fiction.  “There are so many technology ideas that fail because they don’t think through the execution, and there are many business ideas that fail because they don’t think through the technical aspects,” said Harvey of Duke. “For [blockchain] to become mainstream, you need that business expertise.”  Double duty  But the growing demand for blockchain education has created a new and tangible problem for business schools: finding professors and lecturers who can speak on the subject with authority.  This means that the schools are not only competing to attract the brightest students, but also to draw the best minds from a small pool of blockchain experts.  ""It’s hard to find really good instructors and keep them in the university,” said Yermack, who emphasized that these difficulties come despite his location in Manhattan – one of the epicenters of the blockchain community.  ""I could easily do another section with this, but it’s really hard to juggle speakers,"" added Harvey.  While some in academia may point to the emergence of blockchain and data science as simply a fad, others are taking the position that it is a phenomenon that they cannot afford to overlook.  ""I’ve heard more times than I can remember people try to wave this off and say 'This is just a bubble that is going to burst',"" Yermack said, drawing a comparison to the dotcom bubble of the 1990s.  “The risk is not that we commit resources to something that turns out to be pointless,” he added, concluding:  ""The risk is the other direction: that we don’t commit and fail to keep up with it.""

42399755,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydkU,1492430386,Bitwage Upgrades Bitcoin Payroll Service for EU Customers,"Bitcoin startup Bitwage has moved to improve its payroll service for customers based in the EU, launching a new upgrade aimed at speeding up the process for users in the region.  Founded in 2013, the startup provides a means for employers to pay their workers in bitcoin or fiat currencies, using bitcoin as a way to quickly move money worldwide.  Bitwage said today it is now offering unique International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to EU customers who subscribe to its premium service, as well as those who see monthly transaction volumes in excess of €1,999.  An IBAN is a unique string of numbers signifying a specific bank account, and should see customers able to access wages more quickly. Previously, an EU-based customer might have found themselves waiting for a claim to go through.  ""With our new unique IBANs, users receiving wages for EU companies no longer need to create deposit claims, as payment descriptions are no longer required for these transactions,"" the startup said in a statement.  San Francisco-based Bitwage further positioned the upgrade as part of a broader push into the European market, saying:  ""We hope to bring our innovative solution from the US into the European markets so that people can begin receiving their wages in digital assets and leverage the solution for faster, cheaper payments across borders.""

42399764,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbydtL,1492426805,Millions in Minutes: How Polychain Makes Sense of the ICO Wild West,"Token fever is taking hold in Bitcoinland.  Call them 'token sales', 'initial coin offerings' or just plain 'ICOs', the idea that funding a new project can be as simple as creating cryptographically unique units of data, linking them to a blockchain and selling them to the public is attracting venture investors and web crawlers alike.  Yet, if there is some shape to a sometimes senseless market (where millions are raised in minutes on white papers and web pages alone), it's being defined by Polychain Capital – one of an increasing number of 'crypto hedge funds' that have sprung up to buy stakes in what's being heralded as a new asset class.  Unique to Polychain, however, is the $10m mandate it received from VC firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. The message sent in the December announcement was clear – a shadowy part of the crypto world was finally being opened for business.  So, if there's someone who knows the secret to the budding market, then Polychain CEO Olaf Carlson-Wee might be that person, or at least, the one best positioned to figure it out.  Founded in mid-2016  (shortly after Carlson-Wee left VC-backed bitcoin exchange Coinbase), Polychain has emerged the de-facto leader in the market (if for a lack of competition at the moment).  The first notable pillar of its investment strategy, however, is that despite what headlines might advertise, Polychain doesn't see token sales as necessarily a new way of funding, a disruptor for traditional Silicon Valley deals.  In a sense, anything that could be considered an existing security isn't of interest to the firm.  Carlson-Wee told CoinDesk:  ”If your token really doesn't interact with your business, that token isn't part of what you're building. You're building a business. You're using tokens to raise money but you could use something else.”  So far, Polychain has made only a few of its bets public, but it is largely investing prior to any public sale in lesser-known token-based projects such as Tezos and MakerDAO.  It's also backed ethereum, the second largest blockchain by way of its ether token, hinting that it's also interested in existing players as well.  The investments come amid a banner year for ICOs, which attracted nearly 50% of the capital raised by more traditional blockchain ventures in 2016, according to a report by CoinDesk Research released in March.  Still, the survey also found that problems in the market remain.  For example, 76% of participants in token sales indicated they were interested in the projects primarily for financial gain – a statistic that backs up the perception that many ICOs may be just 'pump and dumps', little more than modern get-rich-quick schemes.  Secret sauce  But Carlson-Wee disputes these notions about the nascent market.  In discussion, he was open about what his team looks for in a token sale, and how it is turning speculation into informed investment strategy.  Essentially, it amounts to this: Polychain is looking for tokens that incentivize 'core actions' of the protocol, and considers that doing so could result in 100x opportunities.  The line of thinking is similar to what was put out last year by Union Square Ventures in a blog post that touted the idea of 'fat protocols', a theory that says blockchains will create the most value for investors at the infrastructure layer, not in applications.  What does this mean in practice?  For one, Polychain is paying close attention to attempts to tokenize elements of base blockchain components, like the scripting languages they use to describe commands that can then be read by their distributed networks.  ""We think that application developers are similar to applications on the normal internet, they want a selection of programming languages, and certain applications make more sense in certain languages,"" Carlson-Wee said.  That’s why Polychain made a bet on Tezos, a husband-and-wife project advertised as having new governance innovations.  Tezos is written in OCAML (a language that can be formally verified). This makes it an interesting differentiator, Carlson-Wee said, though even he isn't yet sure if the feature will create value.  ""It's unclear how useful that will be,"" he said.  Value-added services  One thing that the firm does believe can add value, however, is its support.  For example, the firm's co-founder (an investor who became the firm's second staff member), Ryan Zurrer, described Polychain less as a VC firm and more as an investment bank, one that is directly involved in helping to boost the projects that it puts its money in.  This includes helping projects with marketing efforts and even the structure of their token offerings, he indicated.  Take Cosmos, a project aiming to build an 'internet of blockchains' that raised $16.8m in 30 minutes last week.  ""They were only planning on raising $10m, but we realized it's going to take a long effort to get Cosmos operating, and that it's a many-year project,"" Zurrer said. ""Raising the soft cap [on total investment] made sense.""  Further, assisting in security auditing is one of Polychain's biggest value-adds, according to Zurrer.  He mentioned Jordie Melina, Joey Krug and the developers behind the smart contracts project Zeppelin as some of the more active auditors working with the firm. Despite high-profile issues with auditing, he also contended that understanding of the science of token issuance is advancing.  ""It's increased significantly since The DAO and because of The DAO,"" he added, referring to the failed project that lost more than $60m last year.  The decentralized internet stack  But Polychain is also interested in investing toward a larger vision.  Ultimately, Carlson-Wee sees blockchain as providing ways to replicate the entire functions of companies programmatically.  ""When you think about the endgame of Uber as a protocol competing with Uber as a company, that's great, but Uber is built on a massive stack of technologies,"" he explains. ""Mobile, identity and reputation, and without each component, Uber wouldn't exist.""  ""What is interesting to us is a decentralized server protocol, a computation protocol, a mobile internet status,"" he continues.  Asked what the world will look like if the firm's investments succeed, Zurrer defaulted to similar assessments of change brought about by the internet.  Projects like IPFS, Cosmos, Polkadot and ethereum, he said, will form the backbone of an internet where power isn't centralized in single entities.  In the meantime, he explained, the nascent community supporting token-based projects will simply have to work through issues, including the inevitable ""spectacular failures"" while trying to prove the market can offer more than high-tech penny stocks.  For Polychain, that means continuing to invest in talented and robust teams, just like VC firms historically have.  He concluded:  ""It comes down to the technical maturity of the project. Is their white paper a hype paper or is it a technical specification? The rules of early-stage investing haven't changed.""

42399748,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybpR,1492423209,What the Father of Venture Capital Can Teach Us About Blockchain,"William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"" and a board advisor to, and investor in, various blockchain projects and startups (See: Disclosures).  In this opinion piece, Mougayar discusses the early days of venture capital, drawing parallels and comparisons to the state of cryptocurrency and token-based investing taking shape today.  Investor Fred Wilson posted the other day about General Georges Doriot, giving us a timely reminder of his work as the 'father of modern venture capital'.  The post inspired me to revisit Doriot's story as told in the book ""Creative Capital: Georges Doriot and the Birth of Venture Capital"", published in 2008 and written by Spencer Ante.  In doing so, I was struck by the similarities between what happened in the 1940s and what is happening now with cryptocurrency, specifically how these early venture capitalists were pushed to break the regulatory mold in order to allow something new to flourish.  Following World War II, Doriot founded the world’s first public venture capital firm, American Research and Development Corporation (ARDC), but it wasn't greeted with the fanfare we associate with the modern VC firms of today.  Consider this:  ""The idea of venture capital was so new that the founders of ARDC were forced to reengineer aspects of various financial regulatory structures in order to make it viable. Before ARDC could offer its stock, for instance, it had to obtain a number of exemptions under the Investment Company Act of 1940 from the Securities and Exchange Commission.""  What's startling about this sentence is that it is almost exactly where we are with cryptocurrency tokens and funds.  New asset class  Today, the industry is begging for a rewrite and a reengineering of the financial regulatory structures of yesteryear, giving hope to the current array of activities that have developed around cryptocurrencies  If that sounds far-fetched, remember that stocks were once considered a new asset class.  The current asset classes include stocks, bonds and cash as 'traditional assets'. Alternative assets include commodities, REITs, collectibles, insurance products, derivatives, foreign currency, venture capital, private equity and distressed securities.  It is also worthy to note that the alternative asset classes have varying degrees of compliance requirements: from being regulated to non-regulated.  Should regulators stop scratching their heads and treat cryptocurrencies simply as a new alternative asset class, we'll be done with the debate.  There is a precedent to that evolution, citing Doriot's work.  Calling on regulators  Most regulators have been waiting and watching the industry. Their wait has been useful, and will be vindicated because we are starting to see progress.  Crowdfunding via cryptocurrencies, I believe, is a viable practice. A lot of good ideas and innovative companies are coming out of these ventures, and while we may not readily see it, this segment is creating thousands of jobs and companies all over the world.  Cryptocurrency fund management is also gaining steam, even though today it looks like a fringe activity or strange beast that has characteristics so unique they can’t be described in the current legal lexicon.  The main point, however, is that cryptocurrencies are not just for money launderers and scammers.  They are for entrepreneurs, technologists, change-the-world dreamers and anyone who believes they can (and will) enable new business models, new types of organizations and new ways to service consumers and businesses alike.  Sound familiar? The prose dedicated to early VC firms will ring a bell.  From Spencer Ante:  ""ARDC may have been launched in 1946, but it took close to 20 years before the investment community bought into the whole the 'venture capital' thing. It really took one big success for investors to take the venture capital business model seriously, which for ARD came in the form of its investment in Digital Equipment Corporation. In 1957, ARD invested $70,000 into Digital Equipment Corp for a 70% ownership stake. By 1967 the position was worth $200 million or 2,800x its original investment.""  Time and persistence  Hopefully, crypto will not take 20 years before the investment community buys into that concept wholeheartedly.  These groups should note, it has already seen big successes. Bitcoin, ethereum and many other crypto projects have generated financial returns for their early investors, while creating a new economy – the blockchain economy.  Just as Georges Doriot was credited for seeing that capital needed to get 'creative' to birth venture capital, we need to be creative today, in order to birth 'crypto capital'. The difference now is we have a roadmap to replicate.  This topic will be discussed in greater depth and with a variety of experts we have assembled from around the world, at the upcoming Token Summit in New York, on 25th May.

42399733,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbybbf,1492419607,Bullion on the Blockchain: A New Gold Standard?,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  It's hard to believe that the price of gold was fixed twice a day via conference call as recently as two years ago.  In 2015, the London gold market (the largest in the world) switched to an electronic pricing system, broadening participation and, in theory, ending decades of opacity, inefficiency and occasional manipulation. However, the price is still fixed only twice a day and most trading of physical bullion still occurs on OTC markets, perpetuating the lack of transparency and cumbersome reconciliation.  This partially explains the recent flurry of activity in gold trading technology.  This past week alone, both Euroclear and the Royal Mint announced progress in testing blockchain-based gold trading. IEX also has trials under way, and the Canadian Royal Mint already allows the public to buy and sell bullion on a blockchain platform.  Other exchanges are looking at non-blockchain clearing solutions.  While each project has different specifications, the common aim is to improve price discovery, smooth settlement, lower counterparty risk, make it easier to verify ownership of the underlying bullion and offer traders and investors a more liquid market in which to buy and sell.  Yet, the magnitude of the upcoming change to the gold market is largely misunderstood. It's not just the mechanics that change – it's the entire ecosystem.  Far-reaching benefits  Let’s take a look at what a more liquid and verifiable market for physical gold could do.  To start with, greater trust in ‘digitized gold’ is likely to further increase demand by lowering skepticism about price fixing and removing doubts about the authenticity of the underlying asset.  Furthermore, late last year, Shariah law was clarified to allow digital gold investment for Islamic finance if physically backed, opening up a potentially huge market.  Also, it would allow for the creation of new types of securities. Rather than 'paper gold' and 'gold reserve banking' (in which derivatives and funds are only partially based on possession of the real thing), investors would have a choice of instruments with solid backing.  Increased demand and a greater choice of vehicle is likely to further boost liquidity, which in turn would increase circulation. This would enhance gold’s functionality as collateral or even as a means of exchange.  The greater the 'usefulness', the greater the value.  New possibilities  Assuming all gold trading eventually moves to systems with verified reserves and instant settlement, we would finally get a better idea of how much gold is actually stored in vaults.  This could create an opportunity for new applications, or even old applications revisited. For example, as a basis for a new kind of digital currency.  While a return to the gold standard is unlikely for the world’s major economies (if only for the magnitude of the operation), the growing interest of central banks in digital currencies is telling.  Bitcoin is often referred to as a 'good' money because of its limited supply, relative fungibility and ease of exchange. If gold can also start to satisfy those requirements, a seismic shift from fiat to digital could be easier to 'sell' – the public is predisposed to trust gold, certainly more so than cryptography.  It could also open the door to the creation of a new global currency as an alternative to the dollar, something that Russia and China are rumored to be looking at.  Thus, a system that started out by backing cryptographic representation and distribution with a solid underlying value could end up doing so much more than boosting transparency, efficiency and demand.  Looking ahead, it could even be setting the stage for a new age in monetary policy.
