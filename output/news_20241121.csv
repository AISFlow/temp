According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, Ethereum’s netflow on Binance has reached a balanced state, with deposits and withdrawals stabilizing. So, what does this mean for ETH? Related Reading: Is Ethereum Undervalued? Investors Hold Firm While Price Targets Rise A Signal To Buy Or Sell? According to the analysis shared by Darkfost, this current behavior seen in Ethereum’s netflow on Binance might indicate an “accumulation phase,” where investors refrain from significant transactions as they await a “catalyst” to guide their next moves. The CryptoQuant analyst wrote: Ethereum’s netflow on Binance has recently turned neutral, indicating a balance between deposits and withdrawals. It could indicates that there is currently no significant buying or selling pressure. This may suggest that ETH is in an accumulation phase, with investors holding their positions and awaiting a catalyst to either buy or sell. Furthermore, Darkfost pointed out that Ethereum’s Open Interest—a measure of the total number of outstanding derivative contracts—has steadily risen. According to the data cited by the analyst, this ETH metric is approaching an all-time high on Binance, potentially signaling increased market activity. Darkfost hinted that this could be the calm before a significant market shift. The analyst concluded by noting: As Open Interest continues to rise and approaches an all-time high on Binance, we can wonder if this is the calm before the storm ? Is Ethereum Gearing For A Major Rally After several weeks of lagging and failing to keep up the bullish pace with Bitcoin, the Ethereum price performance in the past day now signals that the asset may just be ready to fulfill the anticipated major rally many investors and enthusiasts may have been expecting. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has surged by 5%, with a trading price of $3,276 at the time of writing. This price increase has also unsurprisingly spiked the market cap of the second-largest crypto asset. Ethereum’s market cap valuation currently sits at $394 billion, a roughly $26 billion boost from the $368 billion valuation seen in the early hours of today.

36681436,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654213,1732228207,"Crypto Analyst Predicts 37% Upshoot For Dogecoin Price, Points Out Support Levels","Crypto analyst MadWhale has provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. The analyst predicted that the foremost meme coin could witness a significant rally and highlighted support areas that market participants should focus on. Dogecoin Price To Witness A 37% Surge In a TradingView post, MadWhale predicted that the Dogecoin price would likely witness a 37% rally to $0.55 soon. However, the crypto analyst warned that short-term bearish movements or consolidation phases could occur before the major uptrend. MadWhale suggested that this wasn’t something to worry about, as these patterns often appear before a significant surge. Related Reading: $4,000 Solana Price Possible As SOL Breaks Out Of Massive Cup And Handle Pattern MadWhale highlighted key support levels using Fibonacci retracements to manage these Dogecoin price fluctuations better. The crypto analyst’s accompanying chart showed the $0.3 level as the main support based on the Fib level. A bounce of this support level could send Dogecoin to the $0.55 target. The crypto analyst also indicated that the Dogecoin price is showing significant strength, surpassing long-standing resistance levels, which MadWhale mentioned signals an important shift. The analyst said this is a key development as Dogecoin gains momentum with higher trading volumes and growing social media influence. Regarding resistance levels, $0.4 might be the next big hurdle for the Dogecoin price. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital recently stated that $0.4 is a crucial resistance level for Dogecoin, representing the 0.786 Fib level. He noted that Dogecoin has been testing this Fib level but faced rejection on November 19. While the analyst is confident that the Dogecoin price will eventually break above this resistance level, he remarked that it must happen “cleanly and violently” if the foremost meme coin is to witness any major price rally to the upside. Dogecoin breached this $0.4 level following its run after Donald Trump’s victory but couldn’t hold that level as support and has since been consolidating in the $0.3 range. DOGE Ready For The Next Move To The Upside? Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade suggested that the Dogecoin price was ready for its next leg to the upside. In an X post, the analyst stated that Dogecoin is ready for the next run. He identified a Hidden Bullish Divergence on the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) chart, which provides a bullish outlook for DOGE. Related Reading: 297% Spike In Cardano Large Holder Volume Suggests ADA Price Could See Another Uptrend Trader Tardigrade noted that this RSI Hidden Bullish Divergence occurs when the price forms higher lows while the RIS forms lower lows. He added that this signal indicates an uptrend continuation for the Dogecoin price. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently affirmed that the Dogecoin bull run is on and noted that these corrections are typical in every parabolic bull run Dogecoin has recorded. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.38, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42435257,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4koor4,1732226103,Bitwise Joins Mounting Race for Solana ETF,"Crypto-investments firm Bitwise took a big jump Thursday toward offering a Solana exchange traded fund (ETF) in the United States.  Paperwork filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) makes Bitwise the fourth investments company vying to offer a Solana ETF, behind Canary Capital, which filed in October and VanEck and 21Shares which kicked off the race in June.  Donald Trump's coming return to the White House has reset expectations for the crypto industry, making once far-off regulatory propositions more plausible. Current SEC Chair Gary Gensler is set to step down from the agency on Jan. 20, when Trump is sworn into office.  One of those propositions is that SOL — the fuel for transacting on Solana in much the same way that ETH is on Ethereum — could soon be wrapped in an ETF for easy trading by Wall Street investors.  Read more: Solana ETF Applications Look Like Bets on Trump Retaking White House, Making U.S. Friendlier to Crypto  Bitwise already offers a variety of ETFs tracking BTC and ETH, the two cryptoassets generally treated as commodities in the US. It also has shown a gambler's propensity for filing ETF applications over more controversial assets, such as XRP and now SOL.  Solana is one of the stars of this year's bull run as a hub for trading activity, especially among memecoin traders. Its SOL token is also knocking on the door of all-time highs not seen since late 2021, at the peak of the last great bull run.  Bitwise telegraphed its SOL ETF plans earlier this week with a corporate fining in Delaware. Chief Investments Officer Matt Hougan confirmed the filing's legitimacy but declined to comment further.  The crypto-investments company markets heavily to registered investment advisers in the US. It reported $5 billion in assets under management last month.  Cboe, Bitwise's exchange partner for the proposed product, published 19b-4 forms for all four applications on Thursday. Bitwise's S-1 form, another necessary piece of paperwork for the launch of an ETF, had not been published at press time",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/21/bitwise-joins-mounting-race-for-solana-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18172463a019e513e643fd2ed9ab0e0806baf68b-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At one point lower by more than 20%, MicroStrategy closed the session down 16.2%. The move isn't much more than a large blip on the longer-term chart, with shares still higher by more than five-fold for 2024 and ahead nearly eight times from the level of one year ago.  ""MicroStrategy's [valuation] has completely detached from bitcoin fundamentals,"" wrote Citron Research's Andrew Left earlier in the day. A former bull on the stock who recommended four years ago that investors get long bitcoin by buying MicroStrategy, Left said he remains bullish on BTC but has hedged by shorting MSTR.  Of that valuation, MicroStrategy's market cap yesterday and earlier on Thursday topped $100 billion, or more than three times the value of the roughly 331,000 bitcoin on its balance sheet ($32.5 billion at the current price near $98,000). With today's price decline, MicroStrategy's market cap has sunk to about $80 billion.  ""MicroStrategy has officially met my criteria for a textbook parabolic short,"" wrote well-followed technician Bracco on X prior to the market open on Thursday. Bracco noted three consecutive days of double-digit percentage gains and another major overnight gap higher, among other factors, including that MSTR's dollar volume on Wednesday topped that of mega-cap names like Nvidia and Tesla and that a leveraged ETF dedicated to the stock was the fifth-most traded fund in the entire market.  Writing early Thursday in the WSJ's Heard on the Street column, Jonathan Weil took note of the positive flywheel effect that's provided such a boost to the stock of late. The stock's high valuation allows the company to raise capital at favorable prices and buy bitcoin. Bitcoin rises, the stock rises further, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor and team buy even more bitcoin. And so on.  ""If you want to speculate that bitcoin is heading higher, buy some,"" concluded Weil. ""To go long MicroStrategy’s stock is to wager that bizarrely inefficient markets will become even more so.""

Wurster, who will step into the new role on Jan. 1, said that clients of the bank have already been very active in the crypto space through vehicles like exchange-traded funds (ETFs), futures and closed-end funds, and have done well with those.

The crypto asset’s price then spiked 5.7%, reaching $97,811 on Bitstamp, boosting its market cap to $1.93 trillion. Related Reading: XRP On Fire: Over 90% Weekly Growth Catapults Altcoin To Fresh 2-Year High The recent surge in Bitcoin’s value is not just a market trend, but a reflection of the growing optimism surrounding incoming US President Donald Trump’s potential crypto-friendly policies and his pick for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief. This optimism has led to a 3% increase in the cumulative cryptocurrency market cap, now standing at $3.37 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume on Thursday saw a 5% increase, reaching $ 190 billion. Bullish Trend Thanks To Trump’s Win The obvious sign of the optimistic trend in the bitcoin market: its price has more than doubled this year. The whole industry has joined the upward surge, contributing an amazing $900 billion to the total crypto market capitalization. Given that Bitcoin is barely $3,000 short of the $100,000 milestone, the sector is bursting with hope about what the next few weeks can bring for the digital asset. According to Edu Patel, CEO of Mudrex, Bitcoin’s price last year was $30,000. Today, the asset’s price surged to more than $97,000, reflecting a growth of over 300%. Patel said several factors are pushing Bitcoin’s price, including Trump’s election and optimism over his pick as chairman of the SEC, and his friendly crypto policies. In addition, he also acknowledged the growing institutional participation in Bitcoin options and ETFs. Is Trump Planning A Special Position To Oversee Crypto? The recent price surge of Bitcoin underscores the growing importance of the asset and cryptocurrency to the economy. The Trump administration has also signaled the possibility of creating a specific office to oversee the administration’s cryptocurrency policies.

42435263,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kooyI,1732219094,Why the Media Loves the Worst of Crypto,"Is your social media feed once again full of crypto bros taking victory laps attesting to the inevitability of bitcoin?  If you’re wondering, ""How did we get back here?"" or why TV news told you that Bitcoin died, you're not alone. Driven by viral social media campaigns like Elizabeth Warren’s “Anti-Crypto Army,” crypto has become as dirty a word as investment banking was in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The crypto-is-a-scam crowdmay have sounded prescient as FTX blew up in 2022, but the kindest thing you can call these critics today is lazy.  Several areas within the crypto sector are solving tangible problems at scale, from facilitating digital transactions to supporting an internet-native financial system. For instance, stablecoins, which peg digital assets to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, are reaching new heights in adoption, particularly in emerging markets where people face unstable local currencies.  Then there’s decentralized finance (DeFi), which enables users to lend, borrow, and trade assets directly, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries. Yes, in countries with limited access to banking, DeFi represents a significant opportunity for financial inclusion. But in a world radically rethinking trade and dollarization, these primitives also offer a neutral ground to transact, while furthering use and proliferation of the dollar.  Not all crypto projects have clear value, however. Memecoins, digital tokens whose value is driven by internet attention rather than tangible use, are divisive — even within crypto circles. For example, dogecoin, a favorite of Elon Musk, has a market value exceeding 94% of companies in the S&P 500, despite lacking a product or business model. Recently, Chris Dixon, at Andreessen Horowitz, even criticized memecoins’ as undermining understanding of the sector’s utility. If one was looking for a reason to argue crypto is a scam, you could find it in pockets of the memecoin world.  But since Sam Bankman Fried’s ignominious fall in 2022, another new primitive is using crypto rails to rebuild the tangible world: decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). These networks let individuals contribute resources — such as data or connectivity — in exchange for rewards. By crowdsourcing infrastructure, DePIN projects can compete with large incumbents, offering cheaper and more accessible services.  The Atlantic has already called the term DePIN (which was coined by an analyst at Messari) “boring.” But these networks are already changing the market structure of legacy industries. Today, there are over 1,400 DePIN projects building, having raised more than $1 billion in venture funding. But if you relied solely on the Atlantic and Warren’s Twitter feed, you’d still think the industry was fraudulent.  One prominent example is Helium, a network that crowdsources mini-tower and hotspot deployment to create a decentralized mobile coverage network. With over 120,000 active mobile plans in service, Helium provides affordable connectivity by pushing operating costs to the edges of the network. But one could also find reporting calling Helium a scam and declaring it a failure after its token price fell 90% in 2022.  All of which misses how Helium’s business has transformed into a cellular provider from an IoT network. This misunderstanding reflects how volatile token prices often overshadow real business developments. Crypto networks like Helium are often “antifragile,” adapting through volatility, even as extreme price swings fuel misleading narratives.  Perhaps this explains Trump’s affinity for crypto: both he and the crypto industry are often misrepresented or taken out of context. Like with MAGA, certain crypto actors become conflated with the whole industry, and those looking for something to blame find an easy scapegoat. It also explains why crypto-natives feel so misunderstood.  Yes, there is a cohort of crypto-owners that support anarchy, and others still that have abused this unregulated market for personal gain. As the failures of the end of last cycle pushed the mainstream media to pessimism, it makes sense that many believe that The Worst of Crypto is yet to come. But as real use-cases in stablecoins, DeFi and DePIN continue to abound, it’s clear that the best of crypto is yet to come, too.

42435272,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kop5W,1732218298,Ethereum Layer-2 Teams Welcome Proposal to Overhaul Blockchain,"What's good for the L1 is good for the L2s.  That's the assessment the teams behind zkSync and Polygon, two of the leading layer-2 networks running on top of Ethereum, gave of a recent proposal to overhaul the $400 billion blockchain, dismissing suggestions it would make their auxiliary networks redundant.  Last week, at the biennial Devcon gathering in Bangkok, Thailand, developer Justin Drake laid out an ambitious plan to revamp Ethereum’s consensus layer architecture. As part of that plan, which has come to be known as the “Beam Chain,"" Drake suggested incorporating zero-knowledge cryptography, which several L2s use to compress data in order to make transactions faster and cheaper, into the Ethereum protocol.  Over the past few years, many in the Ethereum ecosystem have pushed a rollup-centric roadmap, meaning they would rely on layer-2 networks to overcome Ethereum’s scaling challenges. Zero-knowledge rollups specifically were seen as the superior technology because they have advantages over so-called optimistic rollups in terms of speed and security.  Ahead of Drake’s Devcon talk, many were left wondering what the Beam Chain would mean for the zero-knowledge rollups on Ethereum, and whether they would become obsolete.  “That's really a misconception,” said Alex Gluchowski, the CEO of Matter Labs, the developer firm behind zkSync. “The changes that Justin announced are focused on the consensus layer, not on the execution layer. It's not going to affect the execution layer.”  Ethereum, the base layer, is itself made up of several layers. The consensus layer is responsible for ensuring that blocks are validated, while the execution layer is in charge of executing transactions. Layer-2s, which post their transaction data back to Ethereum, are mostly affected by changes on the execution layer.  In addition to incorporating ZK, Drake's proposal seeks to shorten block times, which could cut transaction costs for L2s settling on Ethereum. Drake also said he wants to introduce single-slot finality, meaning blocks with transaction data could be finalized immediately, and that information would become permanent right away. If all goes as envisioned, the Beam Chain would go live in 2029 (although Ethereum has a history of delaying ambitious technical upgrades.)  “All of those things are great because we depend on Ethereum as the global settlement layer,” Gluchowski said.  Glow-Up for Rollups?  Brendan Farmer, a co-founder at Polygon, also told CoinDesk he doesn’t think the Beam Chain would obsolesce layer-2s. Instead, he said, the upgrade would “make rollups work better.”  “Shorter block times, faster finality, ZK verifiability of what's happening on the consensus layer – those are things that I think have a really positive impact for L2 usability and for L2 interoperability between different ecosystems,” Farmer said.  Faster finality on Ethereum would be especially useful for making layer-2s interoperable, a widely shared goal for scaling networks.  “A big problem with Ethereum right now is that for a block to be considered finalized, it generally takes 12 to 19 minutes,” Farmer said. “If you're moving funds between like Arbitrum and Polygon: until that transaction has been withdrawn from Arbitrum and deposited to Polygon, Polygon can't safely credit those funds to a user until that transaction has been finalized on the L1. So that just leads to a bad user-experience, whereas if you have 12-second finality, that becomes a better user experience.”  Gluchowski of Matter Labs called the Beam Chain a vindication of zero-knowledge proofs as a scaling method.  “Using ZK really emphasizes the fact that ZK is the end game,” he said.

The cryptocurrency market is exciting as Bitcoin leads the charge, delivering explosive gains that have fueled widespread bullish sentiment. Investors and traders alike speculate this rally is far from over, with Bitcoin edging closer to the monumental $100,000 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Charts Signal Potential Breakout Key data from Coinglass reveals another significant milestone: Bitcoin’s Open Interest has reached an all-time high. This surge in Open Interest indicates a flood of capital entering the market, signaling heightened activity and confidence among traders. Such metrics further confirm the euphoric state of the market, where optimism reigns supreme and momentum continues to build. With Bitcoin’s price rallying at an unprecedented pace and market indicators hitting record levels, the stage is set for what many believe to be an almost inevitable breakout above the psychological $100,000 level. The market’s focus is whether BTC can sustain its trajectory or if a temporary pullback will precede the next leg up. Either way, the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin as it cements its status as the leading force in this explosive bull run. Bitcoin Greed Enters The Market Greed has gripped the Bitcoin market, with the average Fear and Greed Index hitting 76%, signaling heightened optimism among investors. This elevated level of greed suggests that market participants are buying aggressively, anticipating that Bitcoin’s price will continue its upward trajectory without significant setbacks. Such sentiment often leads to increased speculative behavior as traders look to capitalize on the ongoing rally. Critical data from Coinglass supports this narrative, revealing that Bitcoin Open Interest—representing the total value of outstanding derivative contracts—has reached an all-time high of $62.69 billion. This unprecedented figure highlights the speculative nature of the current market, as traders use leveraged instruments like futures to amplify their potential gains. While this fuels bullish momentum, it also adds volatility, making the market susceptible to sharp moves in either direction. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s optimistic environment starkly contrasts the broader crypto market, where altcoins continue to struggle to reclaim yearly highs. While BTC leads the charge with record-breaking performance, altcoins have yet to catch up, underscoring Bitcoin’s dominance during this market cycle phase. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Expects A Retrace Before It Breaks ATH – Targets Revealed As speculative activity and investor optimism drive Bitcoin’s price action, the market waits to see if the rally has more fuel or if a correction looms. For now, Bitcoin remains the focal point of this euphoric bull run. BTC Enters Price Discovery Again Bitcoin is trading at $97,500 after setting a fresh all-time high, continuing its explosive rally. The market leader has entered price discovery—a phase often characterized by parabolic trends like the one currently driving BTC higher. Investor anticipation is growing, with the $100,000 mark only 2.5% away. This psychological milestone could act as significant resistance, potentially holding Bitcoin down for an extended period. A consolidation phase around this level would benefit the broader market, allowing altcoins to catch up and the rally to maintain stability. However, price discovery can be unpredictable. If Bitcoin fails to reach the $100,000 mark in the coming days, the market could see a pullback as bullish momentum cools. A retrace to lower demand zones, such as the $88,500 level, would provide the market with a necessary reset before the next leg upward. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Reveals Target Despite the possibility of a short-term correction, Bitcoin’s price action remains strong. Its dominance over the crypto market and the current euphoric sentiment suggest bulls are still firmly in control.

Under his tenure, the lead U.S. securities regulator led a wide-ranging campaign against digital assets companies that was both damaging and frequently unfair. Meanwhile, Gensler offered no clarity to crypto companies wanting to do business the right way. At times, it seemed that Gary, along with his ally, Senator Elizabeth Warren, simply wanted to let crypto die on the vine — such was their obvious distaste for the industry and its arguments.  Having said all this, let’s take a step back and consider Gensler’s crypto legacy in a wider context. Was the lack of regulatory support for crypto all his fault? Or, did he at times become a convenient scapegoat for problems that still exist in financial regulation?  No legislation action  Regulation follows legislation (or ought to) and, in Gary’s defense, he was regulating without much help from Congress. In the 16 years that bitcoin has existed, our legislators have managed to pass precisely no new laws covering digital assets. Is that Gary’s fault? No. He could have pushed more for new laws, stating why they were needed (including with his friend Warren). But he was not a sitting senator or representative and some of the same people in Washington now rejoicing Gensler’s exit are the same people who long failed the industry legislatively speaking.  Historic scandals  Gensler’s tenure coincided with scandals that any SEC chair would have been required to deal with. FTX, an $8 billion fraud, wasn’t Gary’s fault but he was required to deal with it. It’s true that the enforcement-first policy of the SEC seemed like more of a crackdown than cleaning house. But, any SEC would have been required to clear up the law-breaking that occurred during the last market run-up. Some of the SEC’s actions were structural or situational: something anyone sitting in the hot seat would be required to sort out. And some of the enforcement actions are surely good for crypto, helping raise confidence in the sector among its many skeptics.  Too many regulators  Most countries have a single regulator that oversees both securities (stocks and bonds) and commodities (in large part derivatives like futures and options) markets. Not the USA. Here, we have the SEC for securities and the CFTC for commodities. For crypto, that has sowed uncertainty and confusion. Some cryptocurrencies are deemed commodities (bitcoin is the most prominent example) and some — well, nearly all of them — are viewed regulatorily as commodities. The SEC and CFTC act differently. Being overseen by the SEC is generally tougher.  Gensler has certainly battled the turf war while heading both the SEC and (years ago) the CFTC, but the confusing dual-regulator system is, again, hardly his fault.  All of which is to say: Yes, Gensler has been bad for crypto. But it’s overly optimistic to believe that crypto’s regulatory problems will end just because he is heading to the exit on Jan. 20.

FTX Nears Completion Of Chapter 11 Plan In Thursday’s announcement, FTX confirmed that it is nearing the completion of the final prerequisites necessary for its Court-approved Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization to take effect, marking a significant milestone toward initiating creditor and customer distributions. John J. Ray III, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Restructuring Officer of the FTX Debtors, expressed optimism about the upcoming distributions, saying that they will begin distributing proceeds in “early 2025”. Ray emphasized that the timeline reflects the diligent efforts of the team working on behalf of FTX’s creditors and customers, who have reportedly recovered “billions of dollars to date.” He reassured stakeholders that the team is committed to maximizing recoveries and is actively working to finalize arrangements with distribution agents to expedite the return of funds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Almost Hits $98,000: Key Reasons Behind The Rally FTX provided updates on the anticipated timeline for these distributions. In early December, the estate expects to finalize agreements with specialized distribution agents tasked with facilitating the global distribution of recoveries to customers in supported jurisdictions. At that time, FTX will provide detailed instructions for affected customers on how to establish an approved account with these agents through the existing customer portal. What Customers Must Know By the end of December, FTX plans to announce the exact effective date for the distributions, contingent upon a Court Order that will approve the Disputed Claims Reserve Amount—a necessary step outlined in the Confirmation Order. The current expectation is for the Plan to be effective in early January 2025. Following this, the first distribution will be made to holders of allowed claims in the Plan’s Convenience Classes within 60 days. Importantly, the distribution record date will coincide with the effective date, meaning customers will need to be prepared to act swiftly. For customers to qualify for the initial distribution, they must establish an approved account with a distribution agent and complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, along with submitting the required tax forms before the distribution record date. Additionally, claims traders should be aware of specific provisions in the Plan regarding trades made within 45 days prior to the distribution record date. Claims traded during this period may not be reflected on the claims register by the end of business on the distribution record date, which could result in distributions being made to the original claim holders rather than the current traders. FTT Price Reacts To Distribution Announcement At the time of writing, FTX’s native token, FTT, is trading at $2.36, reflecting a substantial surge of nearly 10% within the past 24 hours. Over a longer time frame, the token has posted impressive gains, rising around 40% over the past fourteen days and 18% over the past thirty days, in line with the broader market rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory on 5 November. Related Reading: Whale Alert: $2 Million PEPE Purchase Sees 105 Billion Tokens Snapped Up Data from CoinGecko further indicates that FTT has experienced a significant rise in trading volume over the past 48 hours, which has surged by 38%, resulting in over $135 million traded during this period. However, it is important to note that FTT’s current price remains significantly below its all-time high of $84, reached during the bull market of September 2021, marking a decline of over 97% from its peak value.

42415486,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJcx5,1732214956,U.S. SEC Loses Crypto Lawsuit Over 'Dealer' Definition That Pushed Into Crypto,"The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas has ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission to throw out its so-called ""dealer"" rule, finalized in February.  Crypto industry groups had sued the agency, arguing its rule marked an inappropriate stretch into the sector.  The ruling emerged just as SEC Chair Gary Gensler was announcing his resignation and touted the agency's legal wins against the crypto industry.  A Texas federal court has rejected the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's recent rule expanding the definition of a securities dealer to include a wider swath of firms — including some in the cryptocurrency sector. This adds a significant legal loss to the crypto legacy of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on the same day he announced his January departure.  In response to a lawsuit from the industry lobbying group Blockchain Association and the Crypto Freedom Alliance of Texas, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted an early decision Thursday that slammed the SEC for overextending its legal reach. The court ordered that the rule be thrown out.  ""The court concludes that the SEC exceeded its statutory authority by enacting such a broad definition of dealer untethered from the text, history, and structure of the Exchange Act,"" according to the ruling from Judge Reed O’Connor.  The judge, who previously handled a Consensys suit against the SEC, issued an order that no part of the final rule approved in February can stand.  An SEC spokesman told CoinDesk, ""We’re reviewing the decision and will determine next steps as appropriate.""  The agency's rule was among several it's worked on during the tenure of Chair Gensler that explicitly sought to reinforce that the SEC's authority extended to crypto businesses. The dealer definition was expanded in such a way that it included crypto operations, and the industry argued it was dangerously vague and would have made impossible demands on decentralized finance (DeFi) and also captured crypto traders who didn't offer any dealer services.  Read More: Crypto Lobbyists Sue SEC Over 'Dealer' Definition  Blockchain Association and the Texas group quickly sued, and this rapid response from the court marks a significant legal win against an agency whose chairman has been touting its legal victories against crypto in recent speeches.  Gensler's departure press release on Thursday referenced the agency's clashes with crypto, noting, ""Court after court agreed with the Commission’s actions to protect investors and rejected all arguments that the SEC cannot enforce the law when securities are being offered — whatever their form.""  The Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith called Thursday's ruling a victory for the entire industry.

Bitcoin has been surging when the US stock market has been open outside of a slight sell-off from 2-4 PM ET. Forward one-month historical median seasonal returns rank in the 85th percentile of all days of the year, and forward three-month returns are even better, just shy of the top decile of readings. Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) relentless rally has pressed on. In the past 24 hours, the world's largest crypto has surpassed the $98,000 mark for the first time ever as it closes in on the $100,000 milestone. As shown below, after trending lower from the end of the first quarter through late summer, Bitcoin hit a low on September 6 and finally broke out of that downtrend by mid-October with a parabolic move upwards after the election. Currently, the crypto is up over 80% from that September low. Bitcoin has seen a lot of big green candles in the past few weeks. To gauge how it has traded during the day, below we show an intraday composite of Bitcoin's action since Election Day a little over two weeks ago. This is essentially the average 24-hour path that Bitcoin has taken since Election Day. We have shaded in gray the period from 9:30 AM ET to 4 PM ET, which represents regular trading hours for US equity markets. As you can see, Bitcoin has been surging when the US stock market has been open outside of a slight sell-off from 2-4 PM ET. Is this because of all the new Bitcoin ETF buying that has been happening lately? The surge in Bitcoin prices has also come at a time when seasonality hasn't exactly been at its best. In the second chart below, we show the average path of Bitcoin throughout the year for all years since 2015, over the past five years, and this year. As shown, this year in March and the second half of May, Bitcoin bucked seasonal trends as it saw much stronger runs versus a historical seasonal pattern in which prices have tended to fall. That parallels with this month in which prices have absolutely soared, whereas in the past, Bitcoin has tended to move lower in November before rebounding through the holidays. In fact, as the first days of December approach, forward one-month and three-month seasonality is reaching some of its strongest readings of the year. As shown in the dials below, forward one-month historical median seasonal returns rank in the 85th percentile of all days of the year, and forward three-month returns are even better, just shy of the top decile of readings. Of course, seasonality is no guarantee of future price movements, and the recent rally already leaves Bitcoin very overbought.

The streamlined onboarding process will enable Salvadoran residents to access capital raise opportunities and trading via Bitfinex Securities’ El Salvador-regulated entity more efficiently, while ensuring compliance with regulatory KYC requirements. Salvadorans will now only need an official El Salvador photo ID, a tax ID number, a biometric photo, a residence address and a phone number to open a Bitfinex Securities El Salvador account. Jesse Knutson, Head of Operations at Bitfinex Securities, commented : “Democratising access to investment opportunities is one of the fundamental benefits of bringing capital markets on-chain, and is a principle very much supported by El Salvador’s policymakers. Thanks to a robust regulatory regime, we have a strong pipeline of innovative issuances coming to the El Salvador market, and we want El Salvador’s residents to be first in line to participate. By enabling express onboarding, we are making it as frictionless as possible for millions of Salvadoran residents to access tokenised investment products.” El Salvador passed its groundbreaking Digital Asset Issuance Law in January 2023 to foster financial innovation and growth. In April 2023, Bitfinex Securities became the world’s first international digital asset platform to be licensed as a Digital Asset Service Provider under this framework. It has since worked closely with El Salvador’s regulators to drive new issuances. About Bitfinex Securities Founded in 2021, Bitfinex Securities seeks to harness the technological advancements of the digital asset industry to transform global capital markets.

36674719,177662,1732212029,"USDC and CCTP to launch on Aptos, with Stripe adding Aptos support in crypto products","Palo Alto, California, November 21st, 2024, Chainwire Integration to enhance DeFi use cases on Aptos, expand interoperability, and streamline global payment solutions for merchants. Aptos Foundation today announced the upcoming integration of Circle ’s native USDC and Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) on the Aptos Network, as well as Stripe adding support for Aptos in its crypto products. These integrations make Aptos the home for interoperable DeFi and the fastest, cheapest, and most reliable enterprise-grade blockchain, further expanding its global financial ecosystem. The integration of Aptos into Stripe’s crypto onramp and payouts products, paired with native USDC, will provide reliable fiat on and off-ramps for the Aptos network, streamline merchant pay-ins and payouts, and offer a seamless connection between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Today, USDC is the largest regulated dollar-backed stablecoin with over $37B in circulation. With more than $160M in circulation on Aptos, bridged USDC is the most prevalent stablecoin available on the network. With this integration, native USDC will be issued through the regulated entities of Circle directly on the Aptos network and CCTP will enable developers to design cross-chain experiences by connecting their Aptos apps to the network of supported blockchains. Bridge providers such as Stargate, built on LayerZero, will provide a smooth transition from the existing bridged USDC on Aptos to native USDC over time. There are no immediate changes to the AptosBridge built on LayerZero, and it will continue to operate as normal. Additionally, ahead of the native launch of USDC, bridged USDC from the AptosBridge will be renamed to “lzUSDC” on block explorers. There will be outreach to ecosystem apps to encourage them to make the same change in their app UI and documentation. The launch of CCTP will bring new levels of interoperability to DeFi on Aptos, enabling secure and efficient native USDC transfers. With the addition of Aptos, CCTP will support nine blockchains - including Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum, and Solana —and 72 routes with 1:1 capital efficiency. This move will allow for seamless cross-chain onboarding, swaps, purchases, treasury rebalancing, and more – all while maintaining an accessible and intuitive user experience. With the addition of Aptos to Stripe’s crypto products, users will be able to seamlessly convert fiat currencies into USDC, directly through Aptos-enabled wallets. This integration will enable the use of USDC for Stripe's global network of businesses. The combination of Stripe's payment tools and Aptos’ scalable network unlocks new opportunities for global merchants and payment providers to process transactions faster, more securely, and at lower costs. “Adding support for the Aptos blockchain inside our crypto products broadens consumer and merchant access to more efficient global fund flows with stablecoins; whether it be a retailer accepting payments from around the world, or a platform paying creators no matter where they are,” said John Egan, Head of Crypto at Stripe. “This collaboration brings Stripe's global network together with the power of the Aptos blockchain, opening new avenues for both merchants and consumers to access efficient, stablecoin-based payments.” “The DeFi ecosystem on Aptos has grown to five times its original size in the past year alone, and it’s clear why,” said Nikhil Chandhok, Chief Product Officer at Circle. “Aptos has emerged as a highly efficient way to move money across the globe. The arrival of native USDC and CCTP will only enhance this, and further the vision we share with the Aptos Foundation team of a future where secure digital dollars create a more accessible economy for everyone.” “USDC and CCTP are the gold standards in DeFi, and Stripe is among the most trusted names in financial infrastructure,” said Bashar Lazaar, Head of Grants and Ecosystem at Aptos Foundation. “Circle and Stripe’s integration of Aptos moves the needle in creating a more accessible, secure, and decentralized future of finance. We’re all looking forward to this integration, and are eager to see what the incredible builders in the Aptos ecosystem make possible with this powerful new technology in their toolkit.” “Aptos makes the globally connected economy accessible to everyone by simplifying the movement of economic value,” said Mo Shaikh, CEO of Aptos Labs, which provided technical expertise for the integrations. “I’m looking forward to seeing Aptos becoming a unifying force in the global economy, providing infrastructure that enhances payment efficiency while bringing the peer-to-peer money movement to life for its ecosystem and builders.” For more information about Aptos Foundation and DeFi on Aptos, visit: https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/projects/defi .

36673831,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654214,1732212009,"Analyst Reveals When The Ethereum Price Will Reach A New ATH, It’s Closer Than You Think","The Ethereum price has been consolidating for about a week since it hit a four-month high at $3,420. As the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum has the biggest price correlation with Bitcoin. However, you could argue the Ethereum price has been largely left behind in terms of performance throughout the ongoing bull cycle. Interestingly, a crypto analyst, Ben Lilly, has shared a bold prediction about the trajectory of the Ethereum price. Taking to a post on the social media platform X, Ben Lilly forecasted that the Ethereum price will reach a new all-time high (ATH) between December 21, 2024, and January 7, 2025. The prediction stems from his analysis of the previous performance of the ETH price movements during Bitcoin’s ATH discovery phase in 2021. A Historical Parallel: Ethereum’s 2021 Rally In his analysis, Ben Lilly referenced Ethereum’s price behavior during the historic rally of the Bitcoin price in the 2021 bull run. At the time, the Ethereum price was trading nearly 60% below its 2018 peak. After Bitcoin broke out to fresh ATH levels, it took Ethereum five weeks to follow suit, rallying by about 640% to reach its current ATH of $4,878. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Test Of 0.786 Fibonacci Level, What Happens Next? Lilly believes the present market conditions mirror those of 2021, with the Bitcoin price recently entering price discovery mode. Ethereum, which was approximately 50% below its 2021 peak of $4,418 as of November 2024, has started to rebound, showing over 20% gains within just two weeks from a low of $2,366 on November 4. Interestingly, the analyst’s comments suggest that as the Bitcoin price continues to set new price records this bull run, Ethereum is likely to follow with a substantial price leap very soon. The timeframe for this substantial price leap, he projects, aligns closely with late December 2024 and early January 2025. Based on his projections, the analyst asserts that Ethereum could repeat its historical pattern and rally significantly within a short timeframe. He highlights that a 300% surge from Ethereum’s November 4 low price level could push it toward the $10,000 mark. ETH will form a new ATH between Dec 21-Jan7. I don’t make the rules. pic.twitter.com/NVgVdQ8Bsj — Ben Lilly (@MrBenLilly) November 20, 2024 Current State Of The Ethereum Price Ben Lilly’s Ethereum price prediction highlights the importance of the Bitcoin price momentum to that of the second-largest asset. Particularly, the 2021 pattern he pointed to is a result of an altcoin season where the altcoin market (led by Ethereum) started to outperform the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: 297% Spike In Cardano Large Holder Volume Suggests ADA Price Could See Another Uptrend As it stands, an altcoin season has yet to materialize this cycle, and all the interest is going into Bitcoin. The Bitcoin price is currently on an all-time high roll, meaning the market will have to continue to wait for the interest to roll into Ethereum.

42415478,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJcsg,1732212000,Crypto Foe and SEC Chair Gary Gensler Will Quit When Trump Takes Office,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler — a frequent foe of the cryptocurrency industry — said he will fully leave the agency the day Donald Trump becomes president in January.  He's not just stepping down as head of the main U.S. securities regulator. He will also not stick around as a commissioner, meaning he won't be around to defend his regulatory policies, which have included an aggressive stance toward crypto.  Gensler's resignation will be effective at noon on Jan. 20, the moment President-elect Trump is sworn in, the SEC said in a press release.  In a statement, Gensler called the regulator ""a remarkable agency.""  ""The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants,"" he said. ""It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world.""  The statement went on to thank President Joe Biden and Gensler's fellow commissioners.  Gensler, who took office in April 2021, oversaw a number of enforcement actions and rulemakings directly affecting the crypto industry. Though industry participants hoped he would offer a light-touch approach to crypto, the regulator instead expanded its enforcement actions from targeting crypto issuers, as it did under former SEC Chair Jay Clayton — who served under Trump — to instead filing suit against crypto trading platforms.  The SEC sued Binance, Binance.US, Coinbase, Kraken, Shapeshift and others during Gensler's tenure, alleging the exchanges were unregistered securities brokers and clearinghouses.  Gensler also oversaw the first approval of spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded products, after a decade of crypto companies trying to introduce these products to U.S. markets. He initially opposed them, but a court ruling against the agency pushed him to vote alongside the five-member commission's two Republicans to ultimately approve the ETFs.  Trump has not yet named his nominee to succeed Gensler as SEC chair. A number of individuals have been floated, including former SEC and now private practice attorney Teresa Goody Guillén, former Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks — who also briefly ran Binance.US — and a number of others. Trump's SEC chair, Clayton, has been named as the next president's U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York — the Department of Justice branch usually associated with prosecuting corporate crimes.  In Gensler's absence, the commission will have two members from each party, not yet allowing a three-member Republican block until Trump's future appointment is confirmed by the Senate. Until the GOP has a majority at the commission, major policy shifts or enforcement decisions may have to wait.  In the SEC's press release, Gensler said his work built on Clayton's, including with the lawsuits alleging registration violations.  ""In the last full fiscal year, according to the SEC's Office of the Inspector General, 18 percent of the SEC's tips, complaints, and referrals were crypto-related, despite the crypto markets comprising less than 1 percent of the U.S. capital markets,"" the press release said. ""Court after court agreed with the Commission's actions to protect investors and rejected all arguments that the SEC cannot enforce the law when securities are being offered — whatever their form.""  Still, Thursday's announcement came hours after a federal judge in the Fifth Circuit ruled that the SEC's effort to expand the definition of a ""dealer"" exceeded its authority in a lawsuit brought by crypto lobbyists.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,"Nikhilesh De, Jesse Hamilton",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/21/crypto-foe-sec-chair-gary-gensler-will-quit-when-trump-takes-office,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8cd5049a00576d1f5283c6f9a5b5257f70a7b76-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin's breach of $90,000 this week led to OTC desk balances rising by another 20,000 tokens, according to CryptoQuant.  Retail exchange balances, however, have fallen to less than 3 million tokens, according to Glassnode, the lowest level in two years. That would seemingly be evidence of strong buying interest.  Bottom line: There appears to be a tug of war in the data, with one set indicating sizable retail profit taking similar to the market top earlier this year and another set showing the opposite.

36671172,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654175,1732206657,"Bitcoin Price Almost Hits $98,000: Key Reasons Behind The Rally","Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, surging to $97,852 on Binance. The cryptocurrency is up 5% in the last 24 hours and has gained an impressive 43% over the past 16 days since November 5. The momentum shows no signs of slowing as BTC price continues its steady ascent. Several key factors are driving this remarkable rally: #1 US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Trade Following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, market sentiment has shifted significantly. The initial “Trump trade” has evolved into the “US Bitcoin Reserve Trade,” fueled by speculation that President-elect Trump may establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). This follows his pledge at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville. Industry insiders like David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc and a Trump campaign advisor, and Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, have hinted at the possibility of the SBR becoming a reality. Both have urged that the SBR be established within the first 100 days of Trump’s presidency through an executive order. They warn of the United States potentially falling behind in the global race to accumulate BTC. Related Reading: Countries Are Already Buying Bitcoin ‘In Huge Volumes’, Says Novogratz Bailey revealed on November 9, “There is at least one nation-state that has been actively acquiring Bitcoin and is now a top 5 holder. Hopefully, we hear from them soon.” He emphasized his certainty with a meme, indicating his information is based on knowledge rather than speculation. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, confirmed in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV that “countries are already buying BTC in huge volumes.” The “US Bitcoin Reserve Trade” is expected to continue until Trump’s inauguration on January 20. It remains to be seen whether Trump will follow through on his promises, potentially moving over 208,000 BTC confiscated by law enforcement into the reserve or even adopting Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act proposal to purchase 1 million BTC over five years. #2 Potential Appointment Of A ‘Crypto Czar’ A leak on Wednesday suggests that President-elect Trump’s team is in discussions about creating a new White House position dedicated solely to Bitcoin and crypto policy. Sources familiar with the transition efforts indicate that candidates are being vetted for this role. If established, it would be the first-ever Bitcoin and crypto-specific White House position, underscoring the influence the nascent industry stands to wield in the incoming administration. It is unclear whether the role will be a senior White House staff position or a “crypto czar” overseeing policy and regulation across the federal government. Crypto industry advocates are pushing for the role to have a direct line to Trump – a massive news for the entire industry. #3 Launch Of Bitcoin ETF Options The introduction of Bitcoin ETF options has had a significant impact on the market. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) ETF options, launched on November 19, 2024, saw an unprecedented $1.9 billion in notional exposure on their first day of trading. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart stated, “Final tally of IBIT’s 1st day of options is just shy of $1.9 billion in notional exposure traded via 354k contracts. 289k were Calls & 65k were Puts. That’s a ratio of 4.4:1. These options were almost certainly part of the move to the new Bitcoin all-time highs today.” Related Reading: US Bitcoin Reserve Will Push Price Above $1 Million, Expert Predicts Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Invest, recently highlighted the game-changing nature of Bitcoin ETF options: With the approval by the SEC to list and trade Bitcoin ETF options, we are on the verge of witnessing the most extraordinary upside ‘vol’ of ‘vol’ in financial history. For the first time, Bitcoin’s notional value will be ‘fractionally banked’ with ETF options. This marks the most monumental advancement possible for the crypto market. Park explained that Bitcoin ETF options provide a regulated market where the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) protects clearing members from counterparty risks, allowing Bitcoin’s synthetic notional exposure to grow exponentially. He emphasized that this could lead to an explosive recursive effect on Bitcoin’s price due to unique volatility characteristics and the “volatility smile.” If there were one thing to read today re the game-changing nature of Bitcoin ETF options, read (and bookmark) this one for 2025 – it’s going to be wild. pic.twitter.com/On2DmUsbHX — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) September 20, 2024 #4 Surge In Spot Market And Bitcoin ETFs The latest rally has also been driven by significant activity in the spot market. Heavy spot bids have propelled the price higher, with yesterday’s BTC ETF inflows being a crucial factor. Inflows amounted to $773.4 million, with BlackRock contributing $626.5 million, Fidelity $133.9 million, Bitwise $9.2 million, and ARK Invest $3.8 million. Over the past three days, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have purchased a staggering $1.856 billion worth of Bitcoin. Good morning, Yesterday’s Bitcoin ETF flows were positive for $773.4 million.

42415482,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJcuZ,1732205393,Jito Token Holders Slated for Payday Under TipRouter Proposal,"Investors in Jito's JTO token could soon start collecting payouts on top of their holdings under a redesign of the major Solana protocol's economic rails.  Billions of dollars in crypto value already flow through the network Jito Labs built to make Solana crypto transactions more efficient. Along the way, profit-seeking bots spent billions more in SOL to reorder transactions in their economic interest.  While Jito Labs has historically overseen the distribution of those tips to validators running Jito software, a new setup called the TipRouter is spreading that burden across a network of node operators. They'll be tasked with reaching consensus on who gets a piece of the $15 million worth of tips Jito generates every few days.  In return, those node operators will get a taste of the upside. And so too will JTO holders who grant them legitimacy by staking their assets with them, assuming the new governance proposal JTO-10 is adopted.  The proposed system leans on two of Jito's recent headline-grabbing plays. First, its decision over the summer to build a restaking network for Solana. Second, its embrace of a new type of governance model called futarchy that empowers markets, instead of tokens and votes.  Jito's governance token JTO was created in the image of most every cryptoasset tied to a DAO: holders vote on proposals, and the more tokens they have, the more power they wield in the DAO. Like most governance tokens, JTO captured no direct economic upside.  That will change if JTO-10 passes first through Jito's traditional DAO and then is approved at the futarchy-based MetaDAO. Passage there seems all but certain because futarchic models push traders toward the outcome that is most likely to be economically beneficial for the token.  Interest in MetaDAO has been steadily building the Solana venn diagram of market nerds who care about decentralized governance, but struggled to catch on more broadly because it's quite complicated to participate in. Jito is MetaDAO's most prominent user and a proposal of this magnitude could drive more engagement with futarchy.  The TipRouter setup will also be an early stress test for Jito's restaking setup, one of the first to launch on Solana. Jito Foundation's Brian Smith said the project partly built a restaking setup in order to support the decentralization of the TipRouter.  ""Its a good demonstration that these networks actually have utility, and people are willing to pay to use these networks,"" he said.  Some critical pieces of the final design won't be ready at launch of Jito restaking and TipRouter. For instance, there won't initially be a slashing mechanism that would punish node operators who attempt to lie about where tip rewards ought to flow. Slashing would cut the JTO that stakers allocated to them.  That would be a costly reversal on a setup that — if all works properly and if current network activity persists — might see $3.6 million in tips flow to node operators and their JTO stakers annually.  Slashing is a critical element of ensuring economic security in crypto's broader restaking movement. It's also seen as a paradoxically optional piece of early-days design by the biggest proponents of restaking, most notably sector leader and pioneer EigenLayer.  Smith said Jito's TipRouter will probably have some sort of slashing mechanism eventually. But there's a lot of ""really complicated edge cases"" that need to be accounted for in the meantime, he said.  ""You can have a carrot and a stick. The carrot is big enough at the moment that we probably don't need a stick,"" he said.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/21/jito-token-holders-slated-for-payday-under-tiprouter-proposal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3b1f149d53abb48f80c70a8cae84e218a1fa55e-4770x2683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  2024 - The Year Bitcoin Went Mainstream  2024 has been a year of significant progress for the crypto industry, as bitcoin adoption has reached new heights and regulatory clarity has emerged. From institutional investment to mainstream recognition, the year has seen a major shift in how the world views and interacts with digital assets. In this wrap-up, we will take a closer look at the key events and trends that have shaped the crypto space.  In January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. This marked a major turning point for the cryptocurrency industry, demonstrating the SEC’s willingness to regulate and approve bitcoin ETPs. Building on the bitcoin ETF approval, the SEC approved spot ether ETFs in July. The approval of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs represents a pivotal development in the financial markets, offering a more direct and transparent way for institutional investors to gain exposure to a high-grade asset class.  Notable events this year:  Bank of New York Mellon is set to enter the crypto space as the SEC approves custody services for digital assets, a move that could bring further legitimacy to the industry.  BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust just got a major boost with theSEC approval of spot bitcoin ETF options. It helps to pave the way for wider investment access with increased liquidity, bringing sophisticated hedging strategies and developing bitcoin covered calls from other ETF issuers.  Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed a $67 billion strategic bitcoin reserve to bolster the U.S. dollar. The plan aims to diversify Uncle Sam into bitcoin, securing the dollar’s global reserve currency status. The proposal includes a 1-million-unit BTC purchase program, mirroring the size of U.S. gold reserves. The BITCOIN Act would establish a strategic bitcoin reserve to serve as an additional store of value to bolster America’s balance sheet and ensure the transparent management of bitcoin holdings of the federal government.  We have seen the House pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (“FIT21”) for better consumer protection and regulatory certainty necessary to allow digital asset innovation to flourish in the U.S. This regulation helps to define the roles of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC for a clear crypto framework.  According to SEC 13F filings, the State of Michigan Retirement System is the first state pension fund to buy an ether ETF. It owns 460,000 shares, valued at $11 million, of Grayscale ETH Trust., in addition to the $6.9 million holding of Ark 21Shares bitcoin ETF from this summer.  A 13F filing indicates that Canada’s five largest banks, RBC, TD Bank, Scotiabank, BMO and CIBC, continue to add allocations of bitcoin and ether ETFs to their institutional holdings. The total exposure from the Canadian banks is over $38 million, with Bank of Montreal holding $16.7 million.  January to March 2025 filings will be interesting. They will reveal which new banks and institutions were buying during fall 2024, as the calculus for bitcoin buying changed.  MicroStrategy's recent Q3 2024 financial results announced a Bitcoin Treasury Company strategy. Over the next three years, the company aims to raise $42 billion to invest in bitcoin, with half raised through equities and half through fixed-income securities. By the end of October, MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings amounted to 252,220, valued at approximately $18 billion.  Much like the Bitcoin blockchain layer provides a secure and stable foundation for growth backed by 700 EH/s of energy, the progress made in 2024 has established a solid foundation for the crypto industry’s future development.

It is provided as a general source of information and should not be considered personal investment advice or solicitation to buy or sell securities. The views are those of the author, Kevin Tam. Investors considering any investment should consult with their Investment Advisor to ensure that it is suitable for the investor’s circumstances and risk tolerance before making any investment decision.  - Kevin Tam  Ask an Expert  Q. What is the outlook for the digital asset industry and crypto performance? Is this still a good price entry for investors?  The future of the digital asset industry looks bright. Reasons for optimism include:  · Interest rate cuts create a favorable macro backdrop for bitcoin—the asset benefits, especially during periods of increased money supply or economic stimulus..  · Potential policies such as tariffs might lead to higher inflation. Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a store of value and a hedge against inflation and performs well in these environments.  Q. What regulatory developments could boost advisors' willingness to participate in the crypto market?  A major regulatory development would be repealing SAB 121, which requires custodians to record crypto holdings as both assets and liabilities at fair market value, necessitating a 1:1 reserve in dollars. This policy inflates balance sheets and dissuades institutions from offering crypto custody services.  The FIT21 Act also promises to provide a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets by defining the roles of the SEC and CFTC and categorizing assets based on their decentralization and functionality. This positions crypto as a more structured asset class and boosts confidence for advisors.  Additionally, Trump’s strong support for DeFi could lend legitimacy to the sector and help position DeFi as a viable component of client portfolios.  Altogether, these initiatives could position the U.S. as a leader in digital assets, creating a robust regulatory foundation that encourages advisors to view crypto as a viable, regulated asset class.  Q. How are crypto assets safeguarded, and how can they alleviate investor concerns? What makes an issuer diversified with respect to custody?  Crypto custodians use a combination of security measures to protect against unauthorized access and cyber threats. A primary method that has become a standard by crypto ETF issuers is the use of cold storage, where digital assets are kept offline in secure hardware wallets. These wallets often require multiple signatures to authorize transactions, adding an extra layer of security and reducing the risk of hacks.  - Federico Brokate, VP and head of U.S. business at 21Shares  Keep Reading  Microstrategy now holds 1.5% of all available bitcoin after its recent investment.

36670494,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24473,1732204800,What are the Advantages of Tokenised Funds?,"Tokenised funds offer a transformative approach to asset management by leveraging Bitcoin and Web3-based technological foundations to enhance liquidity, efficiency, and accessibility. Unlike traditional funds, they enable 24/7 trading and secondary market opportunities and self-custody, allowing investors to buy and sell assets with greater flexibility. Fractional ownership increases access to high-value assets like real estate and private equity, democratising investment opportunities. Smart contracts streamline administrative processes, reducing costs and potentially increasing returns for investors. Additionally, tokenised assets can serve as collateral, unlocking liquidity without liquidation. While these advantages are compelling, addressing regulatory and infrastructure challenges remains critical for the widespread adoption of this innovative financial model. How are Tokenised Funds Different from a Traditional Fund? Tokenised funds represent a cutting edge evolution of traditional investment funds, utilising Bitcoin and Web3 technologies to offer unique benefits and efficiencies. At their core, tokenised funds digitise ownership of a fund by issuing tokens on a blockchain, where each token corresponds to a share or unit of the fund. This structure allows for decentralised ownership and management, differing fundamentally from traditional funds, which rely on centralised systems and intermediaries for operations like trading, record-keeping, and compliance. The use of either Bitcoin-based or EVM-centric Web3 tech stacks introduces transparency, immutability, and the potential for automation, setting tokenised funds apart from their legacy counterparts. One key difference is in the way ownership and transactions are recorded. Traditional funds use centralised databases maintained by trusted third parties, such as banks, brokers, or fund administrators. These systems often involve manual processes, are prone to delays, and depend on intermediaries to verify and execute transactions. In contrast, tokenised funds operate on decentralised ledgers, where all transactions are recorded immutably on a blockchain. This system eliminates the need for intermediaries, enabling peer-to-peer (P2P) trading and reducing the time and cost associated with transactions. Additionally, the inherent transparency ensures that ownership and transaction histories are accessible and verifiable by all stakeholders. Tokenised funds significantly reduce or eliminate the reliance on traditional intermediaries such as underwriters, insurers, custodians, and other third parties by utilising decentralised technologies and smart contracts. In traditional investment funds, these intermediaries play crucial roles in processes like validating transactions, holding assets securely, and facilitating compliance. However, in tokenised funds, a blockchain acts as a decentralised, immutable ledger that transparently records all transactions and ownership details. Smart contracts could potentially further automate tasks such as compliance checks, asset transfers, and payment distributions, ensuring that predefined conditions are executed without the need for manual intervention. By embedding these processes within the technology, tokenised funds streamline operations, reducing costs and transaction times while minimising the potential for human error or fraud. This automation creates a more efficient and accessible system for investors, challenging the necessity of many traditional intermediaries in fund management. Another significant distinction lies in liquidity and accessibility. Traditional funds, particularly in private markets, often have limited liquidity, long lock-up periods, and high barriers to entry due to large minimum investment requirements. Tokenised funds address these issues through fractional ownership, allowing investors to purchase smaller portions of high-value assets. Furthermore, tokenised funds can be traded on digital marketplaces, often 24/7, providing continuous liquidity and enabling investors to enter or exit positions at their convenience. This flexibility contrasts sharply with the rigid trading hours and restrictions typically associated with traditional funds. Tokenised funds benefit from operational efficiencies driven by smart contracts, which automate processes such as compliance checks, dividend payments, and settlement. These contracts reduce administrative burdens and operational costs, while traditional funds rely on manual or semi-automated systems that require multiple layers of oversight and reconciliation. As a result, tokenised funds can offer lower fees and faster transaction times. Despite these advantages, tokenised funds still face challenges, such as regulatory uncertainties and the need for robust technological frameworks, which must be addressed for widespread adoption to rival traditional funds fully. Join the discussion about Tokenised Funds in our Discord! What Kind of Advantages do Tokenised Funds Offer Investors? Tokenised funds offer investors enhanced liquidity and flexibility, addressing one of the most significant challenges of traditional funds. Unlike conventional investments that often come with restricted trading hours or lengthy lock-up periods, tokenised funds enable 24/7 trading. Investors can buy, sell, or transfer their fund shares at any time through digital platforms, making it easier to access their investments when needed. This liquidity is particularly transformative for traditionally illiquid assets, such as real estate or private equity, which can now be fractionalised and traded in smaller, more accessible units. By creating a secondary market for these assets, tokenised funds allow investors to manage their portfolios with greater precision and agility. Another major advantage is lower barriers to entry, as tokenisation allows for fractional ownership. In traditional funds, high minimum investment requirements often restrict access to lucrative opportunities like venture capital or private equity. Tokenised funds democratise these investments by enabling smaller, more manageable commitments, making them accessible to a wider range of investors. This inclusivity allows individuals to diversify their portfolios more effectively, gaining exposure to a broader array of assets that were previously reserved for institutional or high-net-worth investors. Fractional ownership also enables investors to participate in high-growth sectors without overcommitting their capital. Cost efficiency is another key benefit offered by tokenised funds. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, many administrative processes, like compliance, record-keeping, and settlement, are automated, reducing operational expenses. This efficiency can lead to lower fees for investors, as fund managers no longer need to rely on intermediaries like brokers, custodians, or underwriters to facilitate transactions. Additionally, the speed of blockchain-enabled settlements minimises delays, allowing investors to realise returns more quickly. These cost savings not only enhance net returns but also make investing more accessible to smaller-scale participants. Lastly, tokenised funds provide greater transparency and security, which are particularly appealing to modern investors. The decentralised nature of blockchain focused technology platforms ensures that all transactions and ownership records are immutably recorded, reducing the risk of fraud or unauthorised changes. Investors can independently verify fund performance and holdings, fostering trust and confidence in the system. The programmability of smart contracts enables features like automated compliance and built-in investor protections, ensuring that all actions adhere to predefined rules. These advantages make tokenised funds a compelling choice for investors seeking a modern, efficient, and secure way to diversify and manage their portfolios. What is the Potential of Tokenised Funds Going Forward? The potential for tokenised funds moving forward lies in their ability to reshape the global asset management landscape, offering innovative solutions to long-standing inefficiencies. As blockchain technology matures and regulatory clarity improves, tokenised funds are likely to see wider adoption across diverse asset classes. Their appeal stems from their ability to democratise access to traditionally illiquid and exclusive investments, such as real estate, private equity, and infrastructure projects. By breaking down assets into smaller, more accessible units, tokenised funds can attract a broader pool of investors, including retail participants who have historically been excluded due to high minimum investment requirements. This shift could lead to greater capital inflows into markets previously dominated by institutional investors. The scalability of tokenised funds offers opportunities for both asset managers and investors. Blockchain technology enables seamless integration with Decentralised Finance (DeFi) ecosystems, where tokenised assets can be utilised as collateral for lending, borrowing, or yield-generating strategies. This interoperability unlocks additional use cases, enhancing the utility of tokenised funds beyond traditional investment purposes. Tokenised funds could support dynamic portfolio rebalancing or automated compliance with evolving regulations, further streamlining operations. Such features position tokenised funds as a key tool in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the emerging decentralised financial ecosystem. Regulatory developments will play a critical role in shaping the future of tokenised funds. As governments and financial authorities establish clearer guidelines for blockchain-based financial products, investor confidence is likely to grow. Well-regulated frameworks can address concerns around fraud, security, and market manipulation, ensuring that tokenised funds gain acceptance among both retail and institutional investors. Collaboration between innovators and traditional financial institutions could lead to hybrid models that combine the advantages of tokenised systems with the stability and trust of legacy infrastructure. This convergence could accelerate the adoption of tokenised funds and establish them as a mainstream investment option. Looking ahead, the adoption of tokenised funds could drive financial inclusion on a global scale. By lowering barriers to entry and increasing accessibility, tokenised funds could empower underserved populations to participate in wealth-building opportunities. Additionally, as technology advances, innovations such as programmable tokens and decentralised identity verification systems could make tokenized funds even more efficient and secure. However, challenges remain, including technological interoperability, the need for robust security measures, and the establishment of industry standards. Addressing these challenges will be critical for unlocking the full potential of tokenised funds and fostering their long-term growth in the financial sector.

In this series, we’ll highlight the spiciest and most interesting projects in the Web3 space. Each article will introduce you to a unique project, explain what it’s all about, and share insights directly from the creators. If you're curious about what’s happening in Web3, this is your place to find out. Our first feature? A creative memecoin project called Department Of Government Inefficiency - D.O.G.I.N.. DoginHood: A Memecoin with Real-World Products D.O.G.I.N. is not your typical meme token. Built on the Solana blockchain, it blends the playful spirit of meme culture with meaningful, real-world ideas. Originally called DoginHood, the project recently rebranded to reflect its evolving vision and purpose. The original name DoginHood was inspired by Robin Hood, symbolizing a desire to stand apart in a crowded market of meme tokens. Unlike many projects that mimic popular tokens like Doge or BabyDoge, the creators aimed to bring something new to the table. As they put it: ""We wanted to create a meme token with a story, a purpose, and a brand that resonates beyond the digital space."" This vision led to the transformation into D.O.G.I.N., an acronym for Department of Government Inefficiency . The name humorously references a recent initiative by President Donald Trump , who announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) , with Elon Musk leading the charge. A unique part of DoginHood is its Gamified Token Launch Platform —the first on Solana. This platform lets users interact with the project through games, adding a fun twist that appeals to both crypto fans and newcomers. DoginHood is also branching out into real-world products. They started by launching their own branded energy drinks to help spread the DoginHood brand in both Web3 and the wider world. And this is just the start: “Our goal is to build a strong community and culture around the brand,” say the creators. The next product on the list? A line of dog supplements, soon to be sold in five countries across Europe, showing that DoginHood aims to connect Web3 with real-life products. DoginHood is more than a meme—it’s a project with a bigger vision. By combining gamified tech, a community-focused story, and real-world products, DoginHood is setting a new path for memecoins.

The token has fluctuated wildly over the course of the last several months and this particular exchange on November 20, has caused significant interest due to its enormity and the prevailing market tendencies. Related Reading: Upbit Listing Sends BONK Skyrocketing 67% For A Fresh ATH In Memecoin Mania Investor Confidence In The Face Of Volatility A bold move from an anonymous investor comes at a time when the meme coin is seeing some volatility. PEPE has been down, trading at about $0.00002027 as of November 19 after hitting an all-time high of about $0.00002457 earlier this month. Based on data from Lookonchain, the unknown investor shelled out $2 million worth of USDC to purchase 105,328,301,633 (approximately 105.33 billion) PEPE in a single transaction.

Some investors might agree with the choice. This includes “whales,” who have been buying PEPE during market swings. PEPE: Market Trends And Performance Since its April 2023 launch, PEPE has undergone significant transformation. Starting extremely modest at $0.00000001, its market value skyrocketed in a few weeks to over $1 billion. This coin got rather more well-known as prominent exchanges like Robinhood and Coinbase started trading it. Still, PEPE is vulnerable to market patterns swayed by more general economic events and social media, just as many cryptocurrencies are. Among the meme coins that have lately gone somewhat popular are PEPE, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. Actually, PEPE saw an amazing increase of more than 106% just in mid-November. Prospects And Obstacles Although the recent acquisition indicates robust investor interest, PEPE and comparable meme currencies are confronted with numerous obstacles. Market volatility continues to be a significant concern, as prices can fluctuate significantly in response to regulatory news or social media trends. Related Reading: Poland Could Lead With Bitcoin Reserve, Presidential Hopeful Says PEPE’s standing in the market could potentially be impacted by rival coins. To maintain its drive, PEPE needs to draw in fresh investors while also showing practical usefulness that goes beyond its status as a joke. For those investors pondering an initiation or increase of their stakes in meme currencies like PEPE, keeping abreast with the shifting rhythm and patterns of the cryptocurrency ecosystem is of utmost importance, given its constant advancement. The most recent large-scale transaction is indicative of the risks and opportunities that are inherent in this rapidly evolving market. Investors are closely monitoring the outcome of this audacious maneuver to determine whether it will prove advantageous or whether the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies will generate additional uncertainty in the near future.

42415483,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJcvp,1732202837,Why We Need Decentralized AI,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping the world around us, from powering novel drug discoveries, to enhancing workforce productivity, to personalizing content on a Netflix feed. With the artificial intelligence industry projected to grow around 40% annually and reach a trillion-dollar market by 2030, AI’s influence could reshape industries at possibly an unprecedented scale. Crypto has potentially a critical role in enabling open-source AI to reach its potential and address some of the current shortcomings in AI development.  Despite this potential, the current AI landscape is largely dominated by closed-source systems controlled by a few tech giants. Closed-source AI refers to proprietary models that are owned and operated by a single entity, with underlying code hidden from public view. Users have little insight into how these models are trained or what data influences their outputs, raising concerns about unethical applications and manipulation, such as promoting addictive content for profit or pushing certain products or biases (see the instance of Google’s Gemini and its historical inaccuracies earlier this year).  Moreover, projections show that frontier models will cost over $1 billion to train in the next few years.High capital requirements and network effects associated with AI development create substantial barriers to entry, stifling innovation and competition from smaller players.  How Open-Source AI Improves the Landscape  Open-source AI offers a way to counter these challenges.In contrast to closed models, open-source AI makes the source code publicly available, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and improve upon the work for free. This openness helps build trust and accountability, as developers and users alike can evaluate the alignment of these models with their own needs and values. A few months ago, Meta announced its support of open-source AI by releasing Llama 3.1, the first frontier-level open-source AI model, citing its accessibility and adaptability.  Despite its benefits, open-source AI faces its own challenges, particularly around funding and coordination. Because open-source AI models can be freely replicated or adapted, it can be difficult to monetize and sustain development efforts. In Meta’s case, Mark Zuckerberg’s decision to open-source didn’t directly lead to revenue generation. Of course, this isn't a significant issue for the company given Meta’s other income streams. For others, this poses a major challenge — particularly startups and independent developers who lack similar resources. The lack of financial incentives can hinder ongoing maintenance and improvement of open-source models, leading to fragmented efforts and inefficiencies.  Decentralized AI: A Solution Through Crypto  Decentralized AI presents a promising alternative to open and closed-sourced AI by leveraging blockchain technology and crypto-based incentives. In decentralized AI systems, no single entity controls the network; instead, ownership, access, and rewards are distributed among participants. This approach addresses the funding and coordination issues that plague open-source AI by introducing token economies that provide ongoing financial incentives to contributors. For example, decentralized networks like NEAR, Bittensor, Allora, Sentient, and Sahara aim to reward participants with native tokens for their contributions to training and improving AI models, creating a sustainable economic model that could enable developers to fund ongoing development.  DCG, the parent company of where I work, yesterday announced that it's setting up Yuma, a new company, to develop decentralized AI technology within the Bittensor ecosystem.  Decentralized AI networks like Sahara, Grass, and Masa are experimenting with rewarding users for contributing their personal data. Anytime personal data is used for training a model on Sahara, users are rewarded with tokens. This example illustrates how blockchain-enabled economic incentives can help bootstrap open-source AI networks by rewarding data contributions, effectively bypassing traditional capital constraints that have hindered access to expensive proprietary data sources like Reddit.  Decentralized AI also enhances coordination through decentralized governance. In the case of OpenAI, a corporate board has control over major decisions that can have major ripple effects; for example, last year, they decided to fire Sam Altman – a decision that was ultimately reversed. In contrast, these decentralized AI networks are public, out in the open, and eventually may be governed by tokenholders. This would enable collective decision-making and resource allocation in a manner that is more aligned with community goals, rather than the goals of only a select few.  As AI continues to expand its influence, the need for more transparent, accessible, and sustainable development models becomes increasingly urgent. While open-source AI offers significant improvements over closed-source systems, it still falls short in areas of funding and coordination. The decentralized AI category is nascent but offers a compelling solution to some of these problems by aligning economic incentives with collaborative innovation and ensuring that AI technologies evolve in a way that can benefit all stakeholders.

Ethereum has failed to trade at par with Bitcoin’s continuous northward push. For context, the pioneering crypto asset broke to a new price discovery today, reaching a new all-time high of $98,000 .Meanwhile, Ethereum has struggled to find its bullish footing, rising just 3.87% in the past week compared to Bitcoin’s 7%. However, analysis from IntoTheBlock suggest Ethereum could witness its bullish phase soon.In a recent analysis, the market intelligence platform stated that Ethereum has historically been the next asset investors rotate their Bitcoin profit to. As a result, the massive capital deployment catalyzing Bitcoin’s bullish outburst would soon flow into the altcoin king.https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1859558492211666999Ethereum Whales Anticipating RedeploymentIntoTheBlock insisted that on-chain activities indicate that Ethereum proponents are expectant of this impending cash flow. The platform mentioned that reduced Ethereum selling pressure shows that the asset’s whales are aware of what’s coming.However, the Thursday commentary suggests a mixed sentiment around the Ethereum ecosystem. The analysis infers that key on-chain indicators have not flipped bullish compared to previous cycles.For instance, IntoTheBlock’s data signals that the creation of a new Ethereum address remains mild in relation to the previous bull cycle. Notably, the analysis mentioned this may likely stem from the surging usage of Ethereum sidechains such as Base.Meanwhile, the data indicates a positive uptick in metrics like daily transactions, transaction volumes, and whale accumulation. The commentary shows that the average 24-hour transactions on the Ethereum network have grown from 1.1 million to 1.22 million in the past three months.IntoTheBlock asserts that an Ethereum upsurge might be on the horizon if Bitcoin consolidates at its current high. However, the analytical firm mentioned five metrics that would indicate Ethereum’s next move.Indicators of Ethereum’s OutbreakPer the analysis, IntoTheBlock emphasized the importance of Ethereum’s daily transactions as the first metric to watch. With around 8 million transactions processed last week, the analytical firm noted that a spike in daily transactions signals growing interest in the Ethereum network. Secondly, the analysis indicated the correlation between increased large holders and Ethereum’s price. Holders of at least 0.1% of Ethereum’s circulating supply maintain a positive net flow, signaling confidence in the asset. Meanwhile, IntoTheBlock noted that the behavior of short-term holders is the third metric that influences Ethereum’s price. An increase in addresses holding Ethereum for less than one month signals retail interest in the altcoin king. The fourth vital indicator is the holding time of transacted coins. Notably, the time users hold Ethereum before distributing their tokens has increased to 11 months, signaling reduced selling pressure. This strengthens the demand-supply curve. Conclusively, the analysis showed the importance of Ethereum’s exchange flows.

Until now, USDC has been available on the network only in a bridged version. The stablecoin company will also add Aptos to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), a tool that helps move USDC across different blockchains. This will help Aptos better connect with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  Stripe will provide crypto on-ramp services on Aptos, aiming to help merchants move money between traditional payment systems and blockchains. Users will be able to directly convert government-issued currencies into USDC through Aptos-enabled crypto wallets.  “Adding support for the Aptos blockchain inside our crypto products broadens consumer and merchant access to more efficient global fund flows with stablecoins, whether it be a retailer accepting payments from around the world, or a platform paying creators no matter where they are"" John Egan, head of crypto at Stripe, said in a statement.

36682342,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102341,1732201752,"CryptoQuant CEO Outlines Reasons Why Bitcoin Bull Market is Just Starting As BTC Breaks $98,300 Peak","Bitcoin is nearing the $100,000 milestone, and on-chain indicators suggest the bull run is still in its nascent phase. Today, Bitcoin climbed to unprecedented heights, surpassing $98,000. This milestone comes after Bitcoin broke its previous peak of $93,000 earlier in the week.Bitcoin's new peak at $98,300 brings it within 2% of the highly anticipated $100,000 mark. However, experts suggest that the ongoing BTC price movements, while substantial, may just be the beginning of more major price action, echoing historical patterns.Indicators Signal Bull Market Transition for BitcoinData from CryptoQuant highlights a shift in Bitcoin’s Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator, entering a zone associated with bullish market behavior. This pattern mirrors conditions seen in early 2020, a precursor to the cryptocurrency's remarkable surge during that year. https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1859457863447703811Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant’s CEO, noted that recent on-chain whale accumulation has become a driving force in this rally. Previously criticized as exaggerated, the data now aligns with rising market activity, suggesting significant investor confidence.Additionally, mining economics underscore the bullish outlook. With mining costs doubling after the latest Bitcoin halving event, miners require higher prices to sustain profitability. The market’s current trajectory suggests these cost pressures may be contributing to the upward movement. Notably, short positions taken by traders are adding fuel to the rally through short squeezes.Q4 Performance and Halving CyclesMoreover, the timing of Bitcoin’s rally aligns with historical patterns, particularly its performance in the fourth quarter following halving cycles. In 2020, Bitcoin’s bull market accelerated during Q4, marked by a steep rise in cumulative returns. Young Ju has suggested a similar trajectory for 2024, emphasizing that whales are unlikely to allow a flat year-over-year performance during this period.Recovery, Consolidation, and Expansion PhasesMoreover, Bitcoin's current rally reflects a structured progression through three key phases: recovery, consolidation, and expansion. In the recovery phase, Bitcoin rebounded from $15,000 to $45,000 between 2023 and 2024, mirroring its 2020 recovery from $3,000 to $9,000. The consolidation phase saw Bitcoin reclaim its previous all-time high (ATH), as observed in 2020-2021, when it moved from $9,000 to $19,000, regaining its 2017 ATH of $19,000. Similarly, in the current cycle, Bitcoin's rise from $45,000 to $68,000 represents a consolidation phase aimed at surpassing its 2021 ATH of $68,000.The expansion phase follows, historically marked by a significant surge after reclaiming the ATH. In 2020, Bitcoin soared from $20,000 to $68,000. A similar expansion is predicted for the 2023-2024 cycle, where Bitcoin is expected to establish new cycle highs far beyond $100,000.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/21/cryptoquant-ceo-outlines-reasons-why-bitcoin-bull-market-is-just-starting-as-btc-breaks-98300-peak/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cryptoquant-ceo-outlines-reasons-why-bitcoin-bull-market-is-just-starting-as-btc-breaks-98300-peak,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Interest in Dogecoin (DOGE) among crypto market participants reached a new height in the past few weeks. This follows Dogecoin’s spectacular price pumps following the U.S. presidential election. Since November 5—the day of the election—when Dogecoin was priced at just $0.1582, the meme coin has seen a 175% increase, reaching $0.4359. According to a recent analysis by Santiment, over 74,800 wallets, mostly retail investors, have joined the Dogecoin ecosystem in the past few weeks, accumulating around 100,000 tokens.While Dogecoin's sensational bull run has cooled, with the coin now trading at $0.3607, market participants expect DOGE to make a comeback and eventually hit the long-awaited $1 price point.Amid this anticipation, The Crypto Basic explores how much a $1,000 investment in Dogecoin today could be worth if the asset reaches higher price levels like $2.55 and $4.35.Value of $1,000 in Dogecoin If DOGE Hits $2.55With Dogecoin trading at $0.3607, a $1,000 investment today would buy an investor 2,772 DOGE tokens. If DOGE reaches $2.55, the value of this $1,000 investment will rise to $7,069. This results in a massive 606% gain or a 6x return on investment.Can Dogecoin Reach $2.55?Researchers at Changelly, a cryptocurrency exchange, believe Dogecoin could reach this price point. However, the analysts projected an eight-year timeline for DOGE to hit $2.55. Notably, this analysis was published before Dogecoin began its explosive price movement earlier this month. Remarkably, the report accurately predicted that Dogecoin would reclaim the $0.30 threshold this month. Meanwhile, some independent analysts in the crypto community believe DOGE could reach $2 in the coming weeks. Value of $1,000 in Dogecoin If DOGE Hits $4.35Meanwhile, if Dogecoin hits $4.35, the 2,772 DOGE tokens purchased today for $1,000 would be worth $12,058. This would represent a staggering 1,105% gain for investors who buy DOGE at current prices.When Can Dogecoin Hit $4.35?According to Changelly analysts, Dogecoin could take up to nine years to reach $4.35. However, crypto community analyst Ali Martinez has predicted that Dogecoin could reach as high as $18, or even $23, as soon as next year. Martinez based this forecast on historical trends in Dogecoin's price movements.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/21/heres-how-much-1000-in-dogecoin-would-be-worth-if-doge-hits-2-55-or-4-35/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-much-1000-in-dogecoin-would-be-worth-if-doge-hits-2-55-or-4-35,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The technical team behind the L1 blockchain announced the development in the hours leading up to press time, emphasizing that Sui Network is now operational again. Following the quick recovery, validators can now approve transactions on the network. First Major Network Issue For context, Sui experienced its first major network issue today, halting block production for more than two hours. The outage stemmed from an issue within the transaction scheduling logic, which eventually crashed the network’s validators.Notably, Sui's official X handle issued a public service announcement confirming its awareness of the network outage. It disclosed that the technical team had identified the issue and would provide a quick fix. Interestingly, it issued another announcement a few minutes later, revealing that the network is back online and processing transactions again. According to the announcement, its community of validators carried out the quick recovery.https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1859569509687849469Sui and Solana Comparison Launched in May 2023, Sui Network is a decentralized L1 blockchain that allows developers to deploy smart contracts while enabling simultaneous processing of multiple transactions. Many crypto enthusiasts labeled it the Solana Killer because it has not experienced any major outage before now. However, with its recent outage, some critics referred to Sui as the next Solana, referencing the latter’s history of network disruption. For context, Solana has experienced major outages since its launch in March 2020. Its first technical issue occurred in January 2022, when it suffered a degraded performance. The network experienced other technical problems ranging from mainnet outages to degraded performance between June 1 and September 30, 2022.On February 25, 2023, Solana experienced another network disruption due to cluster instability. According to data from Protos, its most recent outage happened on February 6, 2024.At the time, the technical team did not provide details about the cause of the outage. However, its mainnet went offline for five hours. Since the last issue, Solana has been a beacon of operational stability, not experiencing any network outage for 289 days.SUI Price Action Meanwhile, the price of SUI plummeted heavily immediately after investors learned about the network's recent outage. Specifically, SUI, which was hovering around $3.55 before the incident, crashed 5.63% to an intraday low of $3.35. Following the network’s quick recovery, SUI’s price rebounded to $3.67, where it trades at press time. Despite this surge, SUI is down 0.26% in the past day. Conversely, the coin has witnessed a weekly increase of 9.42% and a monthly growth of 91.33%. Like most crypto assets, SUI also embarked on a major rally after the U.S. election, hitting an all-time high (ATH) of $3.93 on November 17.

Market observer Ali Martinez drew public attention to the recent whale accumulation spree. Citing data from Santiment, Martinez disclosed that whales have acquired over 550 million DOGE worth $214.5 million over the past week.Whales Buying More DogecoinNotably, these whales typically hold between 10 million and 100 million Dogecoin tokens. They engaged in the latest acquisition while Dogecoin’s price consolidated around the $0.36 to $0.38 range in the last week.Furthermore, when Dogecoin first encountered its notable dump since hitting $0.4350 on November 12, data from Santiment showed that these same whales even added 140 million tokens to their holdings. At that time, their portfolio rose to 19.9 billion DOGE tokens. Interestingly, following the latest buying spree, their holdings have reached 20.6 billion DOGE tokens.This tier of high-net-worth investors has continued to accumulate over the past two months. The accumulation shows a passive trend alongside Dogecoin’s price performance in October. However, as Dogecoin’s price spiked significantly in the first week of November, their holdings mirrored the trend. Now that Dogecoin is about to break out of its short-term consolidation, the whales are positioning themselves for the upcoming momentum. At press time, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3884, down 1.24% in the last 24 hours. Notably, Dogecoin and other meme coins are struggling in the red even as Bitcoin makes a notable push to break $100K.Dogecoin Price to Watch for When the Bulls ReemergeIn an earlier analysis, Martinez predicted a 120% rally for Dogecoin after it formed a bullish pattern following a brief cool-off phase from its speculative run. Martinez suggested the meme coin could surge to $0.82, assuming the $0.37 support holds.He added that after Dogecoin breaks out of its consolidation phase, it will face resistance at $0.4400, with further hurdles at $0.5500 and $0.6500. This would open the door to potential growth toward $1. Additionally, Martinez has emphasized Dogecoin's potential for more significant growth, citing data from Google Trends to suggest that the meme coin is not yet at its peak popularity despite reclaiming a multi-year high two weeks ago.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/21/dogecoin-ready-for-major-pump-as-whales-amass-550m-doge-now-holding-20-6b-tokens/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dogecoin-ready-for-major-pump-as-whales-amass-550m-doge-now-holding-20-6b-tokens,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36667708,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24468,1732199233,What Are Quantoz’s EURQ & USDQ Tokens?,"Quantoz Payments has introduced MiCA-compliant stablecoins, EURQ, and USDQ, designed to operate within the European Union’s regulated cryptocurrency markets. These tokens, classified as Electronic Money Tokens (EMTs), bridge traditional financial systems and blockchain technology while adhering to stringent regulatory standards set by the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR). The EURQ and USDQ tokens are designed to address liquidity and payment needs in secondary markets, such as digital asset trading platforms and Decentralised Finance (DeFi) protocols. EURQ, backed by the Euro, and USDQ, backed by the US Dollar, provide stable, low-cost solutions for cross-border transactions, trading, and hedging against cryptocurrency volatility. These tokens are issued on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-20 tokens, leveraging blockchain’s decentralised infrastructure to enable rapid, secure transfers while adhering to MiCA’s requirements for stability, transparency, and consumer protection. Get started with USDQ Now MiCA compliance is a distinguishing feature of Quantoz’s stablecoins, ensuring that they can be confidently used within regulated EU crypto markets. This compliance mandates robust safeguards, such as independent audits and strict oversight by the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) under an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) licence. Quantoz Payments also ensures the segregation of customer funds from corporate assets, managed by the independent Quantoz Foundation, which oversees the minting and redemption of stablecoins. These measures provide additional layers of trust and security, aligning with regulatory frameworks to support the adoption of stablecoins in institutional and retail markets. The stablecoins’ utility spans several applications, from facilitating cross-border payments and reducing transaction costs to enhancing DeFi activities like lending and liquidity provision. Their programmability supports diverse use cases in Web3 and the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling compliant micropayments and automated machine-to-machine transactions . With their adherence to MiCA and the advantages of blockchain technology, Quantoz’s stablecoins serve as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the evolving digital asset ecosystem in the European Union. Join the discussion about EURQ & USDQ in our Discord! What is the EURQ Token? The EURQ token is an EMT issued by Quantoz Payments, backed by the Euro, and designed to facilitate liquidity and payment needs in secondary markets. As a stablecoin, EURQ is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, offering stability and compliance with the EU’s MiCAR regulatory framework. Its primary use cases include enabling low-cost, fast transactions for trading on crypto exchanges, cross-border payments, and participation in DeFi protocols. By leveraging Ethereum, EURQ provides a secure and efficient means for digital currency transfers while adhering to strict regulatory standards to ensure transparency and consumer protection within the EU. GET STARTED WITH EURQ NOW What is the USDQ Token? The USDQ token is an EMT issued by Quantoz Payments, backed 1:1 by the US Dollar, and designed to facilitate stable and efficient transactions within secondary markets. It operates on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, providing a reliable digital representation of the US Dollar for use in trading, cross-border payments, and DeFi applications. USDQ’s compliance with the newly adopted MiCAR rules ensures it meets rigorous standards for transparency, consumer protection, and regulatory oversight. With its stability and digital asset-based functionality, USDQ enables users to mitigate cryptocurrency volatility while participating seamlessly in digital asset ecosystems across the EU. EURQ & USDQ Tokenomics The tokenomics of EURQ and USDQ are structured to maintain their stability by being fully backed 1:1 by reserves of Euros or US Dollars, respectively. For every EURQ or USDQ token issued, an equivalent amount of fiat currency is held in reserve in secure, regulated accounts managed by the Quantoz Foundation. This independent foundation operates solely to safeguard customer funds, ensuring they are segregated from the operational funds of Quantoz Payments. The reserve mechanism is regularly audited by independent entities to verify that the total amount of tokens in circulation is always fully collateralised by corresponding fiat reserves. This backing ensures the tokens’ value stability and compliance with the EU’s regulatory standards, providing users with confidence in their use as digital currency equivalents.

Throughout 2024, we’ve also placed an emphasis on bridging the knowledge gap that has historically held back adoption in this asset class locally. According to the Ontario Securities Commission, last year only 54% of Canadians could provide a basic definition of crypto. While this is an improvement from 2022, when only 51% could provide a basic definition, there is room for improvement as we enter 2025, and Kraken is dedicated to playing a leading role in accelerating this learning curve. Mehrdad continued: “While we’re pleased with this progress, we’re aware that our mission is not complete and that most people have still not made their first crypto transaction. We’re committed to reducing barriers that are holding some Canadians back from entering the asset class and to ensure that everyone can achieve their own version of financial freedom through cryptoassets.” Get started with Kraken These materials are for general information purposes only and are not investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell, stake or hold any cryptoasset or to engage in any specific trading strategy.

36666678,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654102,1732197629,XRP Binance Inflows Spike: What It Means For Price,"On-chain data shows the XRP Binance Netflow has spiked to positive levels recently. Here’s what this could mean for the asset’s price. XRP Investors Have Been Depositing To Binance Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, a large amount of XRP deposit transactions have headed to Binance recently. The on-chain metric of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which keeps track of the net transfers going in or out of a given centralized exchange. The traditional form of this metric measures the difference between the inflow and outflow volume for the platform, but in the context of the current topic, a different version of the indicator is of interest: one that counts the net number of deposit/withdrawal transactions. When the value of the metric is positive, it means there are more inflow transfers happening for the exchange than outflow ones. As one of the main reasons why investors deposit to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can be bearish for XRP. Related Reading: Cardano Outperforms Market With 50% Surge: Here’s Why On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies withdrawals are dominant on the exchange. Such a trend can be a sign that holders are interested in HODLing into the long term, which can naturally have bullish effects on the price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) of the XRP Exchange Netflow for Binance over the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, the XRP Exchange Netflow for Binance has mostly stayed inside the positive territory during the last two years, which suggests investors have constantly been making withdrawal transactions. Recently, however, the metric appears to have diverged from the norm, as its value has registered a sharp positive spike. The asset has seen a sharp rally of over 54% in the past week, so it’s possible that the traders making the deposits are looking to sell and realize their profits. Now, the main question is, is this selling a potential threat to XRP’s value? The indicator is sitting at 470 right now, which suggests significantly more inflows than outflows. Considering that this is also just the 30-day MA, the peak value is bound to be even higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is About To See A Historically-Profitable Crossover In This Metric While this high number of inflow transactions may look like a danger at first glance, it may actually not be so, since it corresponds to activity that’s mostly from the retail investors. Whales don’t tend to leave behind too many transactions, as they prefer to move large amounts with a single transaction. Thus, whenever this version of the Exchange Netflow spikes, it’s a sign that the small holders are depositing. Naturally, there could still be a few whale transfers among these inflows, which can indeed end up having a negative effect on the XRP price. It only remains to be seen, though, which of the scenarios holds true. XRP Price XRP has pulled ahead of the rest of the market with a sharp rally during the past week, which has taken its price to $1.09.

CORRECTION (Nov. 21, 19:14 UTC): Corrects headline to say the partnership is for cross-border payments. A previous version of the story said it was for FX. Removed fourth paragraph about FX settlement on blockchain and clarified details of Kinexys rebranding.  Mastercard (MA) has connected its blockchain-based system for shifting tokenized assets, the Multi-Token Network (MTN), with JPMorgan’s (JPM) recently rebranded digital assets business Kinexys (formerly known as Onyx).  The collaboration is to enhance B2B cross-border payments, the companies said in a press release on Thursday, “providing greater transparency and faster settlement as well as reducing time zone friction.”  The payments giant said it has invited a number of banks onto its MTN when the platform emerged in mid-2023 with a view to testing out tokenized bank deposits, the use of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC). Mastercard’s token network is working specifically with the JPMorgan’s Kinexys Digital Payments, which was formerly known as JPM Coin.  The firms said in a joint statement that by integrating Mastercard MTN's connectivity with Kinexys Digital Payments, mutual customers of MTN and Kinexys will be able to settle B2B transactions through a single API.  “At Kinexys, we believe our solutions can play a transformative role in the ecosystem for digital global commerce and digital assets, where the value proposition of commercial transaction venues is enhanced by the availability of commercial bank payment rails that can natively integrate with any digital marketplace or platform,” said Naveen Mallela, co-head of Kinexys by J.P. Morgan in a statement.  “By bringing together the power and connectivity of Mastercard’s MTN with Kinexys Digital Payments, we are unlocking greater speed and settlement capabilities for the entire value chain. We are excited about this integration and the new use cases it will bring to life, leveraging the strengths and innovations of both organizations,” said Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president, Blockchain and Digital Assets at Mastercard in a statement.  The banking giant recently rebranded its blockchain platform, Onyx, to Kinexys as it doubled down on real-world asset tokenization efforts. The rebranding was accompanied by plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities to the platform as early as the first quarter of 2025, paving the way for the ""automation of 24/7, near real-time multicurrency clearing and settlement.""

Will this downfall result in a retest of the $400 psychological mark? Let's find out. Bittensor Falls Under $474In the daily chart, Bittensor's price trend shows a declining phase. The TAO token is struggling in a falling wedge pattern and has dropped nearly 25% in the past 9 days. Bittensor Price Chart The downfall started at $624 on November 12 and has now reached $463. The falling wedge pattern has also breached the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $474.Despite the broader market recovery, the increasing bearish influence reveals the lack of underlying demand for the AI token.

The company increased the compute power sold by 92% year-over-year and improved the rate by 12%. Canaan's Avalon Nano 3 machine could conceivably generate increased interest from home miners if the psychological level of $100k BTC is breached. We are not yet in the 'gold rush' phase of the market judging by current Nano 3 prices, but BTC leads CAN stock higher if history is a guide. When I last covered Canaan Inc ( CAN ) for Seeking Alpha in March of this year, I rated the stock a 'hold' and noted the company's high cash burn and reliance on shareholder dilution for funding operations. The latter of which is certainly not unique to Canaan and is generally standard operating procedure among public Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining companies. In this update, we'll look at Canaan's recently reported Q3 earnings report and assess if any further boost can reasonably be expected in the stock now that Bitcoin is seemingly surging toward a six-figure dollar-denominated coin price. What Canaan Does To briefly recap Canaan's business; the company derives most of its revenue from selling Bitcoin mining machines. The company's primary product line is the AvalonMiner machine - the most recent of which is the A15 series: Canaan Q3 Deck Subsequent to the end of September, Canaan announced sales of its A15 series machines to publicly traded Bitcoin miners HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) and CleanSpark ( CLSK ). The company also offers a consumer-focused miner via the Avalon Nano 3 machine. We'll get into that product a bit more shortly. In addition to selling machines to both consumers and major mining businesses in the industry, Canaan also has a self-mining operation that has typically generated between 10-20% of the company's quarterly revenue over the last two years. Canaan's Q3 Earnings For the quarter ended September 2024, Canaan reported $73.6 million in total revenue with $64.5 million in products revenue and just under $9 million in self-mining revenue. The company beat estimates on the top line but missed expectations on EPADS of -$0.27. Canaan While the company managed to reduce COGS year over year by 7% from $102.4 million to $95.1 million, Canaan still reported a gross loss of $21.5 million in Q3. Canaan Quarterly opex came in at $35.3 million which made the total loss from operations $56.8 million; this was actually an improvement from the $112.8 million operating loss in the period from the prior year but a larger operating loss sequentially. Breaking the company's figures down a bit more, Canaan increased the computing power sold by 92% year-over-year: Canaan The average selling price of that compute was $8.8 TH/s, which was up 12% year over year. Something I find interesting from that slide is the Nano 3 sales and revenue from those sales. At $1.4 million for 10,000 units, the Nano 3 generated roughly $140 per unit sold for Canaan last quarter. Canaan I actually think this is a fairly interesting product because it's marketed toward the general public rather than professional miners. When Bitcoin inevitably eclipses six figures, machines like this Nano 3 could conceivably be profitable as in-home miners if energy expenses are low enough. That said, the most realistic scenario is these types of home mining machines will fail to generate a positive return after all-in energy and machine purchase costs. But judging from the company's website, it appears as though December Nano 3 shipments are being sold at a discount. This is not what I'd expect to be seeing with Bitcoin's price nearing $100k. So where is ""digital gold"" fever? In a 'gold rush', there is certainly logic to being in the picks and shovels business. When digging for ""digital gold,"" the shovels are computer chips. During the last cycle, the price of CAN exploded from under $2 per share in October 2020 up over $39 by March 2021: Data by YCharts What's telling to me from the chart above is the fact that it took the price of BTC rocketing over $30k per coin for CAN stock to enter a mania. This cycle, we have a Bitcoin price that is quickly closing in on $100k per coin yet CAN is still close to its nominal share price lows from August. The chart below is similar to a chart I shared in my last CAN piece: Data by YCharts Canaan had a negative net income in 2020 and a deeply negative net income in 2019 - thus, the depressed share price at that time shouldn't be all that surprising. But I think the story that this chart really conveys is pretty simple: Bitcoin led CAN stock and CAN stock led CAN's quarterly revenue. There is certainly no rule that says this has to happen again. But I actually don't dislike the stock down here if we do indeed get a six-figure BTC price. Balance Sheet Considerations Like many other Bitcoin mining stocks, operations are generally subsidized by shareholder dilution. This has certainly been the case for Canaan as well. The company continues to raise capital through preferred share sales and even announced another $30 million of securities sales the same day it released Q3 earnings. This latest preferred offering comes after Canaan closed the third tranche of additional preferred shares for $50 million less than a month prior. Canaan At the end of Q3, Canaan had $71.8 million in cash and $138.2 million in prepayments and other current assets. There was $186.3 million in total liabilities - 81% of which were current with $77 million of that being convertible preferred shares. Canaan The company does have a fairly large BTC stack at 1,212 million coins. That hoard has a market value of $114 million at a $94k BTC price per coin. However, 730 million of those coins are not directly held and thus introduce counterparty risk into the equation. Closing Thoughts If we think about this from the perspective of the market, six-figure Bitcoin is going to probably generate headlines in the broad media landscape. Those headlines may trigger a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency market from the larger public. Higher BTC prices inevitably make the economics of mining more viable. And mining profitability generally strengthens the incentive to mine whether the 'gold' is physical or digital. The point is, as long as Michael Saylor's ' infinite money glitch ' positive feedback loop keeps pushing BTC prices higher, I think there is a realistic scenario where CAN shares can have a run again provided the market starts sniffing out increased machine sales before the revenue is disclosed in Canaan's earnings. But to be clear, I don't think this company is a great long-term investment by any stretch. But as a speculative swing trade with $100k BTC as a primary catalyst, it might be worth a shot at $1.70 per share. I have a small position in CAN that I expect to hold for the next few months. I do not anticipate the share price will get remotely close to revisiting previous cycle highs. I'll reiterate the 'hold' call.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739278-canaan-stock-q3-earnings-is-digital-gold-rush-coming?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36665820.jpeg

The largest crypto has advanced 4.5% over the past 24 hours, leaving the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index behind. Some altcoins are quickly catching up to BTC's gain, with ether (ETH), Chainlink (LINK) and Uniswap (UNI) surging 5% in the past hour. The $100,000-per-BTC mark is just a stone's throw away and BTC futures on Deribit maturing next year are already trading above the threshold. Still, the round-number level might pose a barrier at least in the short term as investors take some profits after a 40% rally in only two weeks. ""If BTC breaks through $100K, there is a high probability of a pullback,"" Gracy Chen, CEO at crypto exchange Bitget, said in a note. It's a ""psychological barrier where investors might reassess their positions, leading to a natural sell-off point, as seen in other asset classes when significant round numbers are breached.""  Crypto-focused U.S. equities also rallied pre-market open. MicroStrategy (MSTR), owner of the largest corporate bitcoin treasury, rose 11% to $520 before the open of U.S. trading. Public companies following MicroStrategy's approach of buying BTC for its treasury also gained. MARA Holdings (MARA) added 10% and Semler Scientific (SMLR) 24% before the opening bell. Options trading on Defiance's 2X long MicroStrategy ETF, which is a leveraged bet on MSTR share prices, took off yesterday and showed extreme bullish positioning with risk-on sentiment at record levels.  The creator of the Chillguy meme threatened legal action for profit-related assets or applications using his character as a spoof token went viral on social media. The Solana-based meme token CHILLGUY, inspired by Phillip Banks' copyrighted character, skyrocketed in price this week nearing $500 million market value fueled by its viral spread on TikTok. Banks’ legal threats tanked the token's price from Wednesday's peak, as holders likely took profits.  Chart of the Day  Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge interest in trending topics, is returning a value of 100 for the worldwide search query ""memecoins"" over the past five years.  A score of 100 represents peak popularity — the maximum number of searches for the query during a given time frame — and points to an impending retail investor frenzy.

36664909,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654002,1732194025,Cardano Outperforms Market With 50% Surge: Here’s Why,"Cardano has outperformed most of the market with a sharp 50% rally during the past week. Here’s what’s driving this run, according to on-chain data. Cardano On-Chain Metrics Have Lit Up Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, a couple of activity-related metrics have spiked for ADA recently. The indicators in question are the Transaction Volume and the Whale Transaction Count. The first of these, the Transaction Volume, keeps track of the total amount of Cardano that’s becoming involved in transfers on the blockchain every day. This metric basically tells us whether the ADA investors have a high interest in trading the coin or not. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is About To See A Historically-Profitable Crossover In This Metric Whereas the Transaction Volume is a general metric, the Whale Transaction Count provides information about the activity level of only a specific investor group: the whales. As the metric’s name implies, it measures the total number of transfers that these humongous investors are making on the network. More formally, it specifically tracks the transactions carrying a value of more than $100,000. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Transaction Volume and the Whale Transaction Count for Cardano over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, both of these on-chain indicators have shot up for Cardano recently, which implies activity across the board has risen on the network. This recent spike in activity has coincided with ADA’s sharp rally, which has put the cryptocurrency at impressive gains of more than 50% over the past week. Given the timing, it’s likely that the increased interest from the investors has played a role in the price surge. At present, the weekly Transaction Volume for Cardano is sitting at around $52 billion, which is a 7-month high for the metric. Similarly, the Whale Transaction Count has a value of 8,900, the highest in 6 months. From the chart, it’s apparent that ADA also saw a simultaneous surge in these metrics back in June. This previously elevated level of activity led to a 26% increase for the coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hashrate Falls Off, Miners Expecting Pause In Bull Run? Something to note, however, is that this last activity spike occurred alongside a bottom for the coin, while the recent one has come as the asset has been rallying. The current high interest in Cardano could certainly act as more fuel for the rally, but it could also very well turn into a profit-taking storm as investors’ gains balloon up. It only remains to be seen which scenario would follow for ADA in the coming days. ADA Price With positive returns of 12% during the last 24 hours, Cardano is currently the best performer among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap.

The crypto market is currently witnessing the second phase of the ongoing bull run, and Shiba Inu has leveraged the bullish phase to record substantial gains. As the uptrend prevailed, SHIB eventually crossed the much-coveted $0.00002 territory on Nov. 9.Smaller Wallets Accumulating SHIB Amid ReboundWith Shiba Inu up 49.01% over the past week, smaller investors are returning to the market amid a period of FOMO. Data from IntoTheBlock suggests that this group of investors, especially those holding less than 100 million SHIB, has been accumulating more tokens.Per the data, wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million Shiba Inu tokens currently amount to 302,660, representing 22.07% of total addresses. Notably, these addresses now hold a whopping 9.46 trillion SHIB tokens, about 0.95% of the total Shiba Inu supply. Shiba Inu Holdings Distribution IntoTheBlock Shiba Inu Holdings Distribution | IntoTheBlock Should these investors hold onto their tokens, their holdings could skyrocket if Shiba Inu reaches certain price milestones. For instance, most recently, market analyst Alex Clay suggested that SHIB could be looking to claim $0.00005685 as its next target.Interestingly, this price level would bring Shiba Inu’s market valuation to value it has not attained in over three years. For context, a $0.00005 price would bring SHIB’s market cap to about $30 billion. The last time the meme coin’s market cap saw this level was in mid-November 2021.The fact that Shiba Inu had attained this valuation in the past confirms the feasibility of the price target. Specifically, a $30 billion valuation translates to a price of $0.00005091 per SHIB. At this value, investors with 10 million to 100 million tokens could witness a rise in their investments.Worth of 10M, 50M, 100M Shiba Inu at $30B Market CapThose holding 10 million tokens are currently sitting at $263 worth of tokens, as SHIB trades for $0.00002630. This value confirms that prospective investors could amass these tokens at a lower price. Notably, if Shiba Inu spikes to the $0.00005091 level, this holding would increase to $509.1, a 93% ROI.Further, investors with 50 million SHIB tokens currently hold $1,315 worth of the crypto asset. A price rally to $0.00005091 would bring the value of these tokens to $2,545. This would mark an addition of $1,230 if SHIB’s market cap hit $30 billion.Meanwhile, holders of 100 million Shiba Inu, currently worth $2,630, would witness more substantial gains should the $30 billion market cap materialize. At this position, these holdings would rise to $5,091, translating to a yield of about $2,461.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/21/here-is-what-10m-50m-100m-shiba-inu-will-be-worth-if-shib-market-cap-hits-only-30b/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-is-what-10m-50m-100m-shiba-inu-will-be-worth-if-shib-market-cap-hits-only-30b,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36682335,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102286,1732191992,Top Trader Says Shiba Inu Set to Break Seven-Month High at $0.000036,"Well-known crypto analyst Carl ""The Moon"" has suggested Shiba Inu could be headed for a seven-month high amid recent chart patterns. In a recent post on X, he asked his followers whether they had been trading Shiba Inu recently. He argued that if the cryptocurrency breaks out to the upside, it could surge to $0.00003630. Carl expressed the sentiment amid an emerging trend in Shiba Inu charts.Shiba Inu Recent Price ActionNotably, Shiba Inu has been in a bearish trend in recent days. The token even lagged behind the broader crypto market during the recent bull frenzy of the past two weeks. At the time, rival meme coins like PEPE and BONK set all-time highs with gains of over 200%, while others, like Dogecoin, surpassed their 2021 peak.While Shiba Inu moved from $0.00001626 to $0.00003031 during the same time, it quickly lost momentum. Now, SHIB is struggling at around $0.000024, down 7% in its weekly performance.SHIB Setting to ExplodeMeanwhile, market watchers like Carl are confident that Shiba Inu is poised for a reversal. In his tweet, he shared a chart showing that Shiba Inu was primed to break out of its short-term downtrend, which followed its peak at $0.00003031 on November 12. His chart outlined the possibility of Shiba Inu experiencing a mild 42% price pump, which could push it to $0.000036 in the short term, potentially before the week ends. Notably, Shiba Inu last traded at $0.000036 range seven months ago in April. Other market analysts share similar views regarding Shiba Inu's price action. For instance, according to analyst Roaring Kitty, Shiba Inu is warming up for a 2X surge despite its underperformance.Ambitious SHIB TargetsMeanwhile, Carl has even bolder, more ambitious targets for Shiba Inu. Last week, he disclosed that he would not sell his SHIB holdings until the token reaches $0.50 . This would present a massive 1,967,629% rise from Shiba Inu's floor price. Previously, he mentioned a price target of $1. It's important to note that these projections are highly futuristic and speculative. Interestingly, as reported by The Crypto Basic in an earlier analysis, if Shiba Inu were to replicate its 2021 success, the price could eliminate all zeros and trade as high as $0.19. However, the chances of this happening in the near term are slim, as Shiba Inu is now a project with a multi-billion-dollar market cap. The token achieved an astronomical 884,400% increase last season as its market cap was a few hundred dollars at the start.",POSITIVE,SHIB | BONK,DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | BONK,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/21/top-trader-says-shiba-inu-set-to-break-seven-month-high-at-0-000036/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-trader-says-shiba-inu-set-to-break-seven-month-high-at-0-000036,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Crypto analyst Quinten Francois commented, “SUI has been down for 55 min, with no blocks produced during this period. SOL 2.0?” Similarly, WantCoinNews expressed interest in how the Sui community and developers will handle the downtime, stating that their response could “either destroy or strengthen the trust in the chain.” They added a personal note, saying, “Let me just ignore this Solana type FUD and look for entries. Minimum $5.” Ben Armstrong, known as BitBoy, weighed in on the matter: “It is with great pause, I declare SUI officially the next SOL. How many times do I have to say it? Can’t wait to hear from the team on this one. Solana has taught us that it’s way better for a blockchain to be overwhelmed than not used.” Related Reading: Aptos Following SUI’s Lead?

36662969,https://coinpaprika.com/news/chinese-court-declares-bitcoin-and-crypto-ownership-legal,1732189903,Chinese Court Declares Bitcoin and Crypto Ownership Legal,"China's High Court has clarified its stance on cryptocurrencies, acknowledging their ""property attributes"" under Chinese law. This means cryptoassets can be treated as commodities but are not recognized as currency or business instruments. While this recognition offers limited legal protections, the court emphasized that raising funds through token issuance or circulation remains illegal. The ruling came during a case involving two businesses embroiled in a fraud dispute over a failed token launch. The court condemned their actions, labeling them as illegal public financing. It reaffirmed that no organization or individual is allowed to engage in unauthorized token issuance or fundraising activities, underscoring China's strict regulatory environment. Despite this firm stance, the court's acknowledgment of crypto as a commodity suggests some legal applications. This view aligns with China's selective support for blockchain technology, particularly in areas like cross-border payments and trade facilitation. At the recent BRICS Summit, China highlighted blockchain's potential in international trade, even using cryptocurrencies for transactions with Russia. Additionally, the digital yuan, China's CBDC , has been integrated into various global trade initiatives. China's strict crypto policies have sparked global discussions about the country’s position in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. While Hong Kong recently approved its first Bitcoin ETF , offering mainland investors indirect exposure to Bitcoin, China continues to limit broader cryptocurrency usage. Meanwhile, other nations, including the U.S., have considered leveraging Bitcoin to counter China's economic influence. The High Court’s ruling reflects China's cautious approach to crypto. While acknowledging its value as a commodity, the court reiterated concerns about the risks associated with token launches and business transactions involving cryptocurrencies. It warned that Bitcoin and similar assets could disrupt financial systems and facilitate illegal activities, reinforcing the country's entrenched anti-crypto stance. Although figures like Tron founder Justin Sun advocate for greater adoption of blockchain technology in China, there are few signs of significant policy shifts. For now, China remains focused on regulating crypto usage , allowing its use only in specific contexts, while maintaining strict control over the broader industry.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/chinese-court-declares-bitcoin-and-crypto-ownership-legal,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36662969.jpeg

Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Parabolic Phase Just Begun’, Is BTC Hitting $100,000 This Week? Solana-Based Memecoin Rug Pulled By 12-Year-Old As the market enters the rally’s second leg, Solana memecoins remain the cycle’s top narrative, and many traders continue to try to find and profit from the next big thing. However, scammers continue to attempt to take advantage of the memecoin frenzy. A Gen Z trader has made the headlights after trying to rug a Solana-based memecoin he created on a live stream. The 12-year-old trader has a crypto-dedicated X account and has previously shared his profits. On Monday, he posted a picture sharing he “just made $2k before school.” The next day, the young trader launched the Gen Z Quant (QUANT) token on the popular Solana-based launchpad, Pump.fun. While the token’s price rose, he expressed surprise before flipping the watchers. According to the on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, the kid sold all his QUANT holdings, around 51 million tokens. The Gen Z trader got 128 Solana (SOL), worth $30,000, for the tokens, making a $29,600 profit in minutes. After the kid ended the live stream, the crypto community took over the Solana memecoin, sending the price toward the $0.08 mark as “revenge.” The token rose over 77,000% to a market capitalization of $82.3 million in the early hours of Wednesday before retracing toward the $50 million mark. As a result, the Gen Z trader’s holdings would have been worth around $4 million just a few hours after rug-pulling. Some crypto investors considered the takeover a “lesson for all of those who rug.” Meanwhile, others questioned the state of the community for it to be scammed by a child and argued that investors should not abandon the Solana memecoin “to prove a point.” The Rapid Fall Of QUANT Following the rug pull, the kid created another two memecoins, LUCY and SORRY, seemingly poking fun at the crypto community for his QUANT scheme. However, he sold these tokens for 103 SOL, worth $24,000 at the time of the report. The Gen Z trader’s scheme also resulted in several memecoins related to the event. However, some of the tokens were based on the kid and his family, who had their information doxxed online after the incident. Notably, a lucky trader managed to get a 2,141x return on his QUANT investment despite the rug pull. Lookonchain also reported on an investor who spent 2 SOL, valued at $462, to buy 18.89 million QUANT tokens. Related Reading: Aptos Following SUI’s Lead?

Despite the takeover, the memecoin’s rally has significantly slowed throughout the day, falling 57% from its peak. As of this writing, the token trades at $0.035, with a market capitalization of $35.11 million.

Trump's pro-crypto stance and Bernstein's $200k BTC forecast support a bullish outlook for MSTX, despite inherent risks. MSTX's leveraged returns align with its goal, but volatility decay and non-diversification elevate risks, making it suitable for momentum traders. Despite high potential returns, MSTX is a momentum play, not a long-term hold, with the future of BTC being the key driver. It's been a while since I covered leveraged ETFs, so I'm back with an analysis of the Defiance Daily Target 2X Long MSTR ETF ( MSTX ), which is leveraged to its underlying security, MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ). As most investors are now aware, a major aspect of MSTR's growth strategy is its Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holding. With BTC rallying on the back of Trump 2.0 and now at dizzying highs that threaten to rapidly breach the $100k per BTC level, every single ETF associated with this crypto, as well as several others, has seen a fortnight-long rally that seems to have plenty of steam to keep moving up. Greed often brings danger and risk, and this is probably one of the most dangerous and risky scenarios there is in the world of investing today. BTC longs are having their day/week/fortnight/etc., and investor expectations around the future of cryptocurrencies have, for all intents and purposes, gotten far ahead of themselves. Ironically, though, that impetus is far from being fully priced in. When you look at it from that angle, a leveraged play like MSTX sounds exciting because it comes with the chance to create wealth overnight. It's almost reminiscent of the 'accidental millionaire' stories of investors who bought BTC at ridiculously low prices. That being said, however, this is when investors need to be most cautious. Although the signs are all largely positive around decentralized currencies, there are several other factors to consider at this macro level. Let's break it down in the context of investing in MSTX, which I would definitely not suggest at this time unless you're a momentum trader who knows their technicals. How Does MSTX Work to Provide 2x Leverage? MSTX achieves leverage by entering into swap agreements and trading options. These swaps are backed by collateral in the form of treasuries, bond ETFs (short-term), money market funds, corporate debt, and any combination thereof. The strategy also involves shorting the stock when it's headed downward, but as of November 19 , the fund mostly holds long swaps dated September and October 2025. On the options side, the fund holds short-term calls at strikes between $200 and $235. The fund also holds about 7.5% of its total assets in MSTR stock. The leveraged returns thus far have been in line with the fund's goal of achieving a daily 2x return on the underlying, as can be seen from this since-inception chart. Please note that the fund was launched in the middle of August this year. SA So the leveraged approach has clearly worked here, but I also posit that this has largely been the result of a largely predictable appreciation in BTC value since president-elect Trump was voted into office. It's also obvious that any weakness in BTC prices becomes more pronounced in MSTX's performance due to the leverage effect, and that's what I'd like to discuss next. Leverage Risks Leverage on an investment position is always subject to additional risk, but in the case of a leveraged ETF, there are even more risks piled on top. For instance, volatility decay is amplified in such an ETF because of the daily reset. In other words, if you hold such an ETF for any period greater than a single trading day, the daily rebalancing of assets to maintain the 2x leverage can have a significant detrimental effect - particularly if the movement on down days exceeds the movement on up days. And this is true even if the overall movement of the underlying security is positive. That's one of the biggest risks here, and the risk is so impactful that the SEC and FINRA have warned investors for years about it. Here's an extract from a more recent warning: ...because most leveraged and inverse ETFs reset each day, their performance can quickly diverge from the performance of the underlying index or benchmark. In other words, it is possible that you could suffer significant losses even if the long-term performance of the index showed a gain. The warning uses the terms 'index' and 'benchmark' because leveraged ETFs typically use an underlying index as the benchmark against which to compare returns. In the case of MSTX, however, the risk is further elevated because the underlying security is a single stock, not a basket of stocks that can often help absorb some amount of selling pressure. Invest in MSTX or No? That's the real question we're trying to answer here, but that answer isn't as straightforward as it might seem. Although MSTX has managed to achieve a price return of 464% since inception, there's absolutely no guarantee that it will appreciate further. In fact, one single day of BTC price reversal could wipe out a significant chunk of your gains on this ETF. The added risk here is the performance of MSTR itself. Since the fund is leveraged to this single stock, there's also the risk of non-diversification to think about and account for. In essence, you're literally doubling down on your core MSTR investment with this ETF. Of course, you don't really need to own MSTR to own MSTX, but that's where your gains are truly maximized. Owning both securities not only gives you the 2x leverage, but also the base gains from MSTR's positive price action. Moreover, it can help absorb some of the losses incurred with the ETF on BTC down days. In order to definitively address the investment dilemma, the real question we need to ask ourselves is whether or not we think there's much more of a runway for BTC prices in the near term. In order to determine this, let's look at the various catalysts that support a bullish BTC view. President-elect Trump is now pro-crypto This is probably the most bullish catalyst right now. Trump is unequivocally a 'converted' supporter of cryptocurrencies, and Fortune this week reported a phone call between the 47th President(-elect) of the United States and the CEO and founder of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong. I'm posting an extended extract because several points from that report are relevant to a bullish MSTX thesis (emphasis mine): This newfound influence was reflected in a phone call this week between President-elect Donald Trump to Brian Armstrong, founder and CEO of Coinbase. Armstrong and his company poured nearly $50 million into supporting pro-crypto candidates, whose ranks now include Trump , a onetime Bitcoin skeptic who became a full-on convert to digital currency earlier this year. In recent months, Trump has floated ideas like a crypto advisory council and a strategic reserve for Bitcoin. He also counts a number of longtime crypto boosters in his inner circle, including Elon Musk and the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick , whose firm helps manage the reserves of stablecoin giant Tether and who on Tuesday was tapped to be Commerce Secretary. A person familiar with the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Armstrong and Trump did not discuss specific appointments but instead spoke about crypto on a broader level. Coinbase declined to comment on the call. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the two would meet . There have also been unconfirmed reports on X that another prominent crypto CEO, Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse, has had direct access to the President-elect. A Ripple spokesperson told Fortune the company does not discuss private conversations. There's some conjecture here, naturally, but all signs point to the fact that cryptocurrencies have the broad support of the Trump administration, which bodes well for MSTX over the next four years at a minimum. Bernstein predicts $200k BTC in 2025 Brokerage firm Bernstein issued a forecast back in June that saw a $200,000 price target for BTC-USD in the next year. That potentially gives it a +100% upside from its current price of over $92k (as of this writing), which might look optimistic but is nevertheless in line with the bullish sentiment around crypto in general and BTC in particular. Bernstein via The Block That's a fairly confident claim that projects $1 million BTC over the next decade. Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra, in a note to clients at the time, said this: We believe that the U.S regulated ETFs were the watershed moment for crypto that brought in structural demand from traditional pools of capital,” the analysts wrote. “Around $15 billion of net new flows have been brought in by the ETFs combined. We expect Bitcoin ETFs to be equivalent to ~7% of bitcoin in circulation by 2025 and ~15% of bitcoin supply by 2033. Crowdsourced Projections on Binance are more conservative but still very bullish Binance has a forecasting tool on its website that allows visitors to input their estimates of growth rates for BTC price over the next several years. Interestingly, these numbers are much more conservative than those of professional analysts and show a 2030 estimate of $122,985.97 based on growth estimates from users. Now, crowdsourcing predictions and projections is not a new phenomenon. Indeed, here's a nugget that dates back to the early 20th century: The classic wisdom-of-the-crowds finding involves point estimation of a continuous quantity. At a 1906 country fair in Plymouth , 800 people participated in a contest to estimate the weight of a slaughtered and dressed ox. Statistician Francis Galton observed that the median guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate within 1% of the true weight of 1198 pounds. [6] This has contributed to the insight in cognitive science that a crowd's individual judgments can be modeled as a probability distribution of responses with the median centered near the true value of the quantity to be estimated. [7] Further evidence supporting the accuracy of crowdsourced predictions comes from a decade ago, when the office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence sponsored a 3000-participant study called the Good Judgement Project . To cut to the chase, here's what they found (emphasis mine): The group has tackled 250 questions in the experiment so far. None of them have been simple; current questions include whether Turkey will get a new constitution and whether the U.S. and the E.U. will reach a trade deal. But the group consistently got answers right more often than individual experts , just through some simple online research and, in some cases, discussions with each other. The crowdsourced predictions are even reportedly more accurate than those from intelligence agents . One report says that when “superpredictors,” the people who are right most often, are grouped together in teams, they can outperform agents with classified information by as much as 30% . So we now have experts predicting $200k BTC and the ""wisdom of crowds"" projecting $123k BTC by 2025, presumably marked by the end of the calendar year. This actually answers the question we asked in the subheading - should you or should you not invest in MSTX? By definition, since MSTX is an indirect reflection of BTC performance, the consensus all around appears to be decidedly bullish, with upside potential from the current price being between 33% and 116%. The crowds have spoken, and the president-elect appears to have put his stamp of approval on the whole thing. MSTX, therefore, has a Buy recommendation from me. The Downside and The Takeaway There's obviously a ton of risks associated with this stellar potential return on your investment. That return, leveraged 2x based on MSTX's recent historical price return, implies a lower-end upside potential of 66%. So, what balances out that reward? The biggest risk I see is a systemic failure to support the growth of cryptocurrencies, and of all the catalysts on the horizon, the president-elect's political agenda is logically going to be the biggest driver of BTC - either up or down. Judging by the developments I've covered, it seems like a marginal risk at this point, but you never know. Overall, I'd say the future is extremely bright for BTC and, thereby, MSTR and, thereby, MSTX. I call a Strong Buy, but with a caveat that this is purely a momentum play and not a long-term holding by any measure. That momentum is currently very strong, so it makes sense to increase your risk exposure a little and try to make significant gains while it lasts.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739234-mstx-take-the-risk-make-the-gains?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36661544.jpeg

Bitcoin can be a rational investment, especially as a hedge in unstable economies, but its necessity for US investors is debatable. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin-driven strategy is either a financial masterstroke or recklessly risky, with its success hinging on BTC's continued price rise. Here is one thing I think I am thinking about three times. 1) The money supply as the cost of capital. In a recent interview, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor was criticizing Warren Buffett's cash management. Buffett has a colossal cash hoard of $325B sitting in T-Bills earning 4.5%. Saylor, on the other hand, invests his cash in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). He justifies this ""cash management"" by arguing that his ""cost of capital"" is 15%. Saylor makes this claim by arguing that the money supply is increasing by 15% and that that is essentially the real cost of future money. Oh boy. Where do we even start with that? I hesitate to criticize Saylor because this bet has worked out brilliantly so far, but that doesn't change the way economics and finance works. First, I have to defend Buffett for obvious reasons. Warren Buffett is the greater capital allocator in human history. The essence of Berkshire Hathaway is that it's a cash flow monster that he has masterfully allocated across time. Cash management isn't just something he's good at. It's why he is who he is. And a crucial element of that is in understanding that he allocates his cash in productive entities, while leaving roughly 10% of his capital in a liquid form to be deployed when needed. There's absolutely nothing wrong with buying Bitcoin, and it's worked out beautifully so far for MSTR, but Bitcoin is not cash. In fact, Bitcoin increasingly looks like a levered form of QQQ. And the whole point of owning something like TBills is that they can be deployed when things like QQQ become discounted. If BTC were to crater for some reason MSTR would not be able to lean into this ""cash"" holding and in fact, there's a very real chance that the internal leverage could result in them becoming forced sellers of BTC. It's not just dissimilar to what Buffett is doing with TBills. It's almost the opposite of the way Buffett thinks about dry powder. And in fact, Saylor is funding his BTC purchases…wait for it, by selling bonds to obtain fiat. The difference between him and Buffett is that he isn't using organic cash flows to fund the asset purchases and is instead getting his fiat from lenders. Second, the money supply isn't inflation. That's like saying that calories are fat. Sure, if you eat too many calories and don't put your calories to good use by being active then you will get fat. Similarly, if we just printed off money and didn't do anything productive with it then that money would just lead to inflation. But that's not what actually happens. Money creation very often (not always) leads to productive uses that create real resources and are therefore deflationary in many cases or inflation neutral. That's why economists specifically measure inflation based on the change in prices of a basket of consumer goods. You can't just say ""NVIDIA borrowed $100M from JPMorgan; therefore inflation will go up"". No, NVIDIA is very likely creating money and then using it in a manner that will be accretive to earnings and generate real resources that are inflation neutral in the long run. Of course, it's also true that government spending is often inflationary. We experienced very high inflation during Covid, in large part due to government spending. But even then, the 15% assumption is wildly overstated. Don't get me wrong. There are lots of smart reasons to own something like Bitcoin, and I am not some anti-coiner type. But sometimes the narratives are a bit much. 2) TradFi's inability to adopt Bitcoin I guess I am what Bitcoin Maximalists might call a ""traditional finance"" (tradfi) guy. I've long stated that there are perfectly rational reasons to own Bitcoin. I believe this is especially true if you live in a 3rd world economy where the probability of currency collapse is even moderately high. I believe the story is more complex for US investors, where the Dollar is so stable. When it comes to practical money management, it's an asset you might want, but don't necessarily need. I think most people in tradfi think of Bitcoin somewhat similarly. I've mentioned this in the past, but Bitcoin falls into the Defined Duration model as a form of insurance. It's a super long duration instrument that exhibits huge asymmetric upside at times and gives you an insurance hedge against fiat currency. The question someone has to ask themselves about an asset like this is: a) Do I need insurance of this type? b) If yes, then how much? These are super personal questions and in the case of a US investor I'd argue the use case isn't nearly as compelling as the use case for someone in, say, Argentina. When you think of it as a form of insurance there's nothing within traditional finance that says this is wrong. In fact, traditional finance mastered the art of selling insurance to people. But there's nothing wrong with a traditional finance portfolio holding something like Bitcoin. I just think you have to compartmentalize it properly and thinking of it as insurance has helped me understand the use cases without getting caught up in all the competing narratives about it (or worse, dismissing it entirely). 3) The world's best (or worst) investment bank. Speaking of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) - I can't stop loving this story. I've said this for a year now, but it's either the greatest thing to ever happen in finance or it's the most reckless thing to ever happen in finance. I have no idea, but there's really no in between in my view. To some degree, it's all very ponzi-like. MSTR is selling bonds to fund purchases of BTC, and those purchases help drive the price of BTC up, which allows MSTR to finance more bonds. It's magnificently brilliant as long as the price of BTC keeps going up. As long as it keeps going up. I've joked that MSTR has turned into the world's most successful investment bank, except instead of helping finance capital formation, they're just financing number go up. And look, it's worked brilliantly so far. Saylor is winning. In fact, you could argue he's won. He could walk away right now and say, ""I won all finance forever and ever"". MSTR is up 3,000% in the last 5 years. This kinda makes you wonder - if Saylor is right that the cost of capital is 15% per year, then MSTR has generated about 24 years' worth of returns in just the last 5 years. When do you step back and say, ""I won""? Or do you? Can you? I don't know the right answer. I'm just a boring old traditional finance guy. But me personally - I'd be really tempted to pack up my bags, declare victory and go buy… anything I wanted.

42415488,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJcyL,1732185060,Futures Open Interest on CME Surpasses 215K Bitcoin for the First Time as BTC Eyes $100K,"Bitcoin futures open interest on the CME exchange has hit 218,000 BTC ($21.3 billion).  The cryptocurrency's market cap is closing in on a historic $2 trillion.  CME growth is largely coming from active and direct participants, K33 research says.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the largest token by market capitalization, is approaching a $2 trillion market cap for the first time after its price added $30,000 since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election at the beginning of the month.  Currently at $1.93 trillion, a price of about $101,000 per bitcoin would achieve this landmark. The BTC price crossed $97,000 for the first earlier Thursday, and its market dominance reached a high of just below 61.8%.  According to Coinglass data, bitcoin futures open interest (OI) on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) hit a record 218,000 BTC ($21.3 billion), more than a third higher than before the Nov. 5 election. Rising open interest when prices are also ratcheting higher is a sign of bullish sentiment in the market.  ""The relentless surge in CME open interest shows no sign of stopping; back-to-back all-time highs,"" Velte Lunde, head of research at K33, wrote in a post on X. ""To contextualize, the growth in CME OI over the past 15 days is larger than the average notional open interest on CME in any year before 2022.""  Lunde noted that active and direct market participants are behind the rally. This cohort engages directly with the futures market, whereas other growth could have come from futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the ProShare Bitcoin ETF (BITO), as CoinDesk reported last month.  The introduction of options tied to U.S. spot ETFs should also help CME futures grow.  ""CME open interest crosses 200k BTC, with active market participants continuing to be the force moving exposure higher. Expect CME futures to continue to thrive with the launch of ETF options"", Lunde wrote.  Volatility should decrease over time  The larger bitcoin's role and the more intertwined it becomes with the traditional financial (TradFi) system, the more likely volatility will decline over time. We have seen this over the past few years, as realized volatility has decreased from over 100% to approximately 40%, according to Glassnode data.  Cash-margin contracts are also at an all-time high. These contracts use stablecoins or U.S. dollars as the underlying collateral and are inherently not volatile. That's in contrast with crypto collateral, which is volatile by nature.  CME uses only cash margin for futures open interest, while retail-focused exchanges such as Binance are prepared to accept crypto margin.

36659508,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654131,1732183257,"Bitcoin Soars To New Highs Near $95,000: Analyst Reveals Bullish Price Targets Ahead","Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new record high of $94,730, continuing a significant uptrend that began on November 5. Analysts are dubbing this rally the “Trump trade,” as the recent political developments surrounding Donald Trump’s victory have instilled renewed confidence among investors in BTC and the broader crypto market. Analyst Forecasts 42% Increase For BTC Despite the impressive surge, analysts believe Bitcoin’s price discovery is far from complete, indicating substantial potential for further growth. Among those sharing this bullish sentiment is analyst Ali Martinez, who draws parallels between Bitcoin’s current price movements and those seen in December 2020, before the notable uptrend that ultimately led to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Related Reading: Dogecoin Forms A ‘Nasty Triple Top’: Analyst Reveals What’s Next Martinez notes that the relative strength index (RSI), a key technical indicator used to gauge momentum, is currently mirroring the patterns observed in late 2020. This similarity suggests that the BTC price may be poised for significant upward movements in the coming months. According to Martinez, if this trend continues, Bitcoin could target the $108,000 mark, followed by a potential correction to around $99,000, before bouncing back to a predicted milestone of $135,000. This forecast represents an increase of over 42% from current levels, although Martinez did not specify a timeline for these movements, indicating they might occur anywhere between now and the first quarter of 2025. Bitcoin To Reach $1 Million By 2029? In even more optimistic projections, market expert Timothy Peterson, who identifies as a network economist, suggests that Bitcoin’s current bullish trend could persist until November 2025, with ambitious targets set for the future. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Peterson predicted that Bitcoin could reach $275,000 per coin by Thanksgiving Day 2025. He bases this projection on Metcalfe’s Law, which posits that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its number of users. This indicates that as more individuals adopt Bitcoin, its value is likely to increase significantly. Related Reading: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Options Surge: December 20 Call Signals BTC Price Target Of $180,000 Looking further ahead, the economist also asserts that the Bitcoin price could achieve the coveted valuation of $1,000,000 per coin by 2029, representing a staggering 954% increase from current levels. Trading at $94,730 as of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has seen massive gains in recent weeks, with a 26% and 39% increase in the fourteen and thirty day time frames, respectively. Furthermore, BTC has reached a market cap valuation of $1.8 trillion, making it one of the most valuable assets in the world, currently ranked 7th, just behind companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Amazon. But quite far from the leading asset in this matter which is gold with a market cap of $17 trillion.

This move signals the company’s strategy to expand its crypto offerings, capitalizing on the growing popularity of blockchain assets like Solana. The filing is a step toward submitting the ETF for approval to the SEC, though challenges remain. The proposed Solana ETF aims to track the price of Solana (SOL) and is part of Bitwise’s broader expansion efforts. This year, the company has experienced remarkable growth, with assets under management (AUM) surging by 400%, now totaling billions of dollars. Recent acquisitions and the success of other ETFs, including its Bitcoin and Ethereum offerings, underline Bitwise’s aggressive approach. The firm joins competitors like VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital in seeking to capitalize on Solana’s rising prominence. However, the road to approval remains uncertain. The SEC has historically scrutinized crypto ETFs, citing concerns about asset classification , custodial risks, and potential market manipulation. Solana’s status as a commodity has been debated in the past, adding to the challenges. Earlier this year, similar proposals were removed from regulatory exchanges, casting doubt on approval timelines. Despite these hurdles, Bitwise and other firms remain optimistic, banking on a changing regulatory landscape. Optimism has increased with the election of Donald Trump, whose administration has signaled a more crypto-friendly approach. Industry experts believe Trump’s policies could reduce regulatory barriers, fostering innovation and increasing the likelihood of ETF approvals. Trump’s pro-crypto stance has created hope for greater institutional adoption , as the administration prioritizes blockchain innovation and investor accessibility. Analysts suggest that approval of a Solana ETF under Trump’s leadership could reshape the U.S. crypto market, allowing the country to compete with nations like Brazil, which already launched a Solana ETF. The move could strengthen the U.S.’s position as a global leader in blockchain technology and attract more investments and talent. Bitwise’s Solana ETF, if approved, could pave the way for broader crypto ETF adoption, including potential funds focused on other tokens like XRP, ADA, or AVAX. The industry views these developments as a sign that crypto regulation is evolving toward a more supportive framework, driving further innovation and institutional involvement.",POSITIVE,ADA | SOL,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitwise-pushes-for-solana-etf-amid-crypto-optimism,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36658859.jpeg

This position would act as a link between Congress, regulators, and the White House to shape and oversee cryptocurrency policies. While no official candidates have been named, rumors suggest Brian Brooks, a former Binance.US and Coinbase executive, is being considered. The responsibilities of this role remain unclear, but some speculate that the advisor could play a significant part in policy implementation and regulatory decisions. Trump’s campaign has emphasized a pro-crypto stance, with promises to support Bitcoin-friendly reforms and appoint industry advocates to key financial roles. He also proposed the creation of a Bitcoin Reserve as part of his broader plans to promote cryptocurrency growth. Reports indicate that Trump’s team has been conducting interviews with potential candidates, including discussions at Mar-a-Lago. However, there has been no official comment on the selection process, and other potential contenders have not been disclosed. During his campaign, Trump received informal advice on crypto policy from Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, who helped draft executive orders aimed at supporting the industry. Bailey described the Bitcoin Reserve as a transformative policy that could ensure Bitcoin’s growth in the U.S. Trump himself spoke at Bailey’s conference in Nashville, signaling his commitment to the cryptocurrency space. While details about the new role are still emerging, it is expected to bolster the presence of crypto-friendly advocates in the federal government. Whether the advisor will solely operate within the White House or take on a broader ""crypto czar"" role remains to be seen.

The payout includes principal amounts and interest for those eligible, marking a major step in compensating participants impacted by the collapse of the blockchain startup. BitClave, which raised $25.5 million through its Consumer Activity Token (CAT) ICO, faced a lawsuit from the SEC in 2020 for violating federal securities laws. The funds for the distribution came from the BitClave Fair Fund , established by the SEC to assist affected investors. While the company initially agreed to pay nearly $29 million to the fund, it had only contributed $12 million by early 2023. Eligible investors were required to file claims by August 2023, and the SEC completed its review process in March 2024. The SEC confirmed the distribution via a post on X (formerly Twitter), stating: “The checks are in the mail. We are sending out more than $4.6M to investors harmed by BitClave, PTE Ltd.’s unregistered ICO of digital asset securities.” The 2017 ICO was one of the fastest fundraising campaigns at the time, collecting its target amount in less than a minute. However, the startup’s failure left many investors at a loss, prompting the SEC to take legal action. This reimbursement represents a significant step in addressing the fallout from the unregistered ICO. Looking ahead, major changes are expected in the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation. President-elect Donald Trump, set to take office in January 2025, is reportedly planning a pro-crypto shift in regulatory policies. Reports indicate that SEC Chair Gary Gensler may resign after Thanksgiving, following criticism over his strict enforcement-focused stance on digital assets. Trump’s administration is considering appointing pro-crypto officials to key positions, including a new SEC chair. One leading contender is Scott Bessent, a strong advocate for cryptocurrency, who may also be in line for the role of Treasury Secretary. In addition, Trump is reportedly planning to establish a permanent crypto advisor role in the White House, which would act as a bridge between Congress, regulators, and the administration on crypto-related issues. These developments signal a potential shift in US cryptocurrency policy, with the new administration aiming to balance innovation with oversight. The SEC’s recent restitution to BitClave investors reflects ongoing efforts to address past missteps in the crypto space while laying the groundwork for a more regulated and investor-friendly environment in the future.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/sec-refunds-4-6m-to-bitclave-ico-investors-amid-crypto-policy-shift,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36658380.jpeg

Notable figures in the crypto community responded by humorously suggesting Banks accepts tokens or money through a Solana address.  The CHILLGUY token's popularity was supposedly fueled by its viral spread on TikTok, where even non-crypto users were discussing how to buy it, leading to a speculative trend of searching for new viral tokens on social media.  Chillguy's 100,000 token holders aren’t feeling so chill anymore.  Phillip Banks, the meme’s creator, is threatening to issue takedown notices for profit-related assets or applications using the character he created as a spoof meme token that went viral on Crypto Twitter.  “Chill guy has been copyrighted. like, legally. I'll be issuing takedowns on for-profit related things over the next few days,” Banks said on X. “not like brand accounts using him as a trend, that's kinda something i dont really care about (i do just ask for credit. or xboxes.). mainly unauthorized merchandise and shitcoins.”  Banks’ legal threats turned down the heat on the CHILLGUY token, whose creator is unkown. It is almost 50% below its Wednesday peak, with the decline strengthened by profit-taking.  Notable Crypto Twitter traders, meanwhile, are asking Banks to post a Solana address for receiving money or tokens — in the hopes of keeping the fun going. It's not clear whom Banks plans to target.  The meme took Crypto Twitter by storm this week as the parody Solana-based CHILLGUY token rocketed more than 1,000% in a single day, notching up a $500 million market capitalization at Wednesday's peak.  Chillguy portrays a character unfazed by life's challenges. It has attracted interest from brands to El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, boosting narratives around the token.  Early backers claimed the memecoin went viral on video content network TikTok, where “normies” — or the general public that doesn’t hold crypto — were supposedly making videos on how to buy the token and how it was on track for higher gains ahead.  That spurred an entire narrative of scouring TikTok for new crypto picks, with speculators hoping to find tokens going viral among normies for short-term trading.  Such memecoins often rise rapidly due to speculation, community hype and social media trends. They are, however, also extremely volatile, with prices driven more by sentiment and marketing than a strong community.  These trends often don't last long. They can peak quickly due to hype but are prone to rapid declines once the excitement wanes.

The company, led by CEO Michael Saylor, adopted a bold Bitcoin-focused strategy that has propelled its market value to over $110 billion. This milestone follows a series of massive Bitcoin purchases, including $4.6 billion worth of BTC acquired through funds raised from convertible senior notes. The company’s recent success puts it ahead of notable firms like Intel and Dell. MicroStrategy announced the sale of $1.75 billion in convertible notes on November 18, specifically to buy more Bitcoin. Strong demand prompted the company to increase the offering to $2.6 billion just two days later. This strategy reflects Saylor’s belief in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Since its first BTC purchase in 2020, MicroStrategy has steadily expanded its cryptocurrency reserves, setting itself apart from other firms in the US stock market. Bitcoin’s bullish performance has also contributed to MicroStrategy’s rise. The firm’s heavy investment in Bitcoin has created a positive feedback loop , where its purchases support BTC prices, further boosting the company’s stock. In 2024, MicroStrategy’s stock saw remarkable gains, and at one point, it was the most traded stock in the US, surpassing major names like Tesla and Nvidia. While some analysts praise MicroStrategy’s visionary approach , others warn of the risks tied to Bitcoin’s volatility. A sudden decline in BTC prices could lead to significant losses, given the company’s Bitcoin-heavy balance sheet. This has raised concerns among risk-averse investors, who see the lack of diversification as a potential weakness. Despite this, Saylor’s BTC-first policy has positioned the company as a leader in institutional Bitcoin adoption. MicroStrategy’s actions have also had broader implications for the cryptocurrency market. The firm’s large Bitcoin purchases have contributed to increased liquidity and price stability. Its success signals growing confidence in Bitcoin among traditional investors and institutions. As one of the largest holders of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy’s moves influence market trends, reflecting the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. The debate over the company’s strategy remains active. Some view its Bitcoin-centric approach as a bold innovation that has paid off significantly, while others question whether the lack of diversification will be sustainable in the long run. Despite differing opinions, the company’s actions serve as a case study for how businesses can adopt cryptocurrency to drive growth and achieve market prominence. Looking forward, MicroStrategy’s journey will provide valuable insights into the risks and rewards of heavy cryptocurrency investments. Whether its approach will continue to outperform more traditional strategies remains uncertain, but the company has undoubtedly reshaped how businesses view Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Its rise into the top 100 public companies marks a significant milestone , showcasing the growing role of cryptocurrencies in today’s economy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-surges-to-top-100-us-firms-with-bitcoin-bet,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36658193.jpeg

Though BitGo has operated in APAC since 2015 and had a presence in Singapore, it did not provide specific Singapore-regulated services. The firm received a Major Payment Institution License (MPI) from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), in August this year. As a result, it is now rolling out a wider suite of products that will put its local offerings on par with those offered in Europe and the U.S.  In addition to its custody and wallet services, BitGo will now offer regulated cold storage for over 1,100 digital assets, 24/7 electronic and voice trading, real-time automated settlements and full-service token management solutions.  Globally, BitGo already has over 1,500 institutional clients in 50 countries and secures approximately 20% of all on-chain bitcoin {{BTC}} transactions by value. In Singapore, it’s hoping to tap into demand from institutional clients operating in the city for regulated infrastructure services, CEO of BitGo Singapore, Youngro Lee told CoinDesk.  “A lot of institutions in Singapore and Asia haven't really done much [in crypto]. There have been some traditional institutions that have been working with digital assets, but in a very limited fashion,” Lee said, adding that most of the activity in Singapore is coming from “non-traditional institutions” such as investment funds, venture funds, hedge funds, family offices and high net worth individuals.  “We believe the market will grow larger over time, especially with the U.S. elections and how the world is trending toward digital asset adoption, especially bitcoin. More traditional investors and traditional institutions will want to both offer and engage in digital asset services, and we hope to be one of the partners in Singapore,” he said.  Singapore has emerged as a strong contender for becoming a regional crypto hub in Asia, thanks in part to introducing a regulatory framework for crypto service providers in 2019. That said, despite hundreds of applications, to date only 29 companies are listed on MAS’s website as holding an MPI for digital payment token services. This includes other well-known crypto companies such as Coinbase, Circle, OKX, Paxos and Ripple.  While BitGo’s team in Singapore remains small – less than 20, according to Lee – the company also expects to grow its local team if and when market demand increases over the next few years.  In addition to its Singapore subsidiary, BitGo also has operations in South Korea, where Hana Financial and SK Telecom have 25% and 10% stakes in its local company, respectively.  BitGo is also mulling further expansion into other areas in APAC. “We don't have any specific plans yet, but obviously we're looking at the different opportunities and challenges. A lot of it depends on the regulatory environment and how effective and efficient the process will be for us to work with regulators,” Lee said.  “So far, we've had a great relationship and great dynamic with MAS, and that's one of the reasons why we decided to commit to building in Singapore,” he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Callan Quinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/21/bitgo-launches-singapore-services-eyes-other-crypto-friendly-regions-in-asia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a2e939ffe53631551c3fa9f584b610f0958de3b-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly considering creating this position to guide US policy on blockchain and digital assets, signaling an effort to modernize crypto regulations. Among the names suggested, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum, has proposed Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, for the role. Hoskinson believes Armstrong’s expertise makes him a strong candidate. He emphasized Armstrong’s leadership at Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, as evidence of his ability to navigate complex regulatory challenges. Hoskinson highlighted the need for a neutral, well-informed leader who understands the unique value of cryptocurrencies and can unite the industry while fostering innovation. Criticizing the Biden administration’s approach to crypto regulation, he described it as overly aggressive and focused on enforcement rather than collaboration. Hoskinson also announced Operation Baseline, a project by IOHK to identify inefficiencies in US crypto regulations. Drawing on his experience in helping Wyoming pass 31 crypto-friendly laws , he expressed his willingness to work with lawmakers to modernize the regulatory framework. The crypto community, however, remains divided on Armstrong’s suitability. Some support Hoskinson’s view, seeing Armstrong as a pragmatic choice capable of appealing to various stakeholders. Others are critical, citing his association with centralized entities like Coinbase and its perceived alignment with traditional finance (TradFi). Critics argue this could conflict with the decentralized ethos of the cryptocurrency movement. Supporters highlight Armstrong’s experience and neutrality as valuable assets. One commenter noted that a non-partisan leader with ties across the crypto ecosystem would be ideal for the role. Armstrong’s work with Coinbase , which interacts with a broad range of crypto projects and stakeholders, positions him as a candidate with a holistic understanding of the industry. Another potential candidate is Brian Brooks, former Binance.US CEO and former Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase. Brooks, who also served as Acting Comptroller of the Currency, has significant regulatory experience. He played a key role in integrating digital assets into the banking system and is respected for his efforts to bridge the gap between crypto and policymakers. His deep understanding of both the crypto industry and traditional financial systems makes him a strong contender. Both Armstrong and Brooks bring unique strengths to the table. Armstrong’s pioneering role in crypto exchanges gives him a market-first perspective, while Brooks offers extensive experience in navigating regulatory landscapes. The debate over who should take on this role reflects broader challenges in balancing innovation with regulation. Hoskinson sees this potential appointment as an opportunity for the US to establish itself as a global leader in blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation. He urged the industry to unite behind a common vision, focusing on fostering growth while addressing regulatory gaps. Trump’s consideration of a Crypto-Czar reflects a growing recognition of the role digital assets play in the global economy. Whether Armstrong, Brooks, or another candidate is ultimately selected, the choice will significantly influence the future of US crypto policies. The outcome will also signal how the administration plans to balance the need for regulation with the drive for innovation in this fast-evolving space.",NEUTRAL,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-eyes-crypto-czar:-coinbase-ceo-backed-for-key-role,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36657240.jpeg

Efficient Operations in Two Major Governance Modules The HTX DAO Governance Modules focus on the trading ecosystem and its related functional modules. Each Governance Module corresponds to a specific functional area, including external cooperation and community governance , and is assigned specific committee positions that focus on specific governance tasks within that module to achieve detailed management and effective governance. Key responsibilities for the roles are detailed below: 1. Committee Members for Community Governance: Focused on increasing engagement and building consensus in community governance, these committee members will encourage DAO members to get deeply involved in governance discussions and proposal formulation while expanding the depth and reach of content dissemination. 2. Committee Members for Brand Building: With a focus on boosting HTX DAO’s brand influence and market recognition, these committee members will drive the brand’s external visibility and expand collaborations while strengthening external users’ understanding and support of HTX DAO. Ensure Transparency in Recruitment with Layer-by-Layer Selection The recruitment for HTX DAO Governance Committee members is open from November 15 to December 4. (Application link: https://forms.gle/oBWRfgMcxXhagCH26 ). Candidates will be announced on December 6, followed by community voting until December 13. The final list of selected committee members will be revealed on December 16, and the new governance committee will officially begin its term. For the latest updates and news on recruitment, follow the HTX DAO’s official account on X and Telegram. A market-competitive basic pay will be offered to ensure committee members’ dedication and continuous participation in DAO governance. In addition, extra rewards will be provided based on governance contributions, motivating members to actively drive community development. HTX DAO now rotates its committee members every six months to ensure the vitality and innovation of the governance team at different stages. In the future, as the DAO becomes more decentralized, the rotation mechanism will be more flexible. The community will vote on committee members’ terms to adapt to the evolving governance requirements. HTX DAO is in the early stages of building an exchange-oriented DAO. The establishment of a governance committee plays a key role in HTX DAO’s development, as it will help convey its philosophy to the global crypto community. Looking ahead, HTX DAO will focus on attracting users from around the world, while exploring methods to grant more decision-making power to community members. This will strengthen democratic governance, foster greater engagement, and boost community vitality.

36656612,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654101,1732177802,Analyst Reveals Bitcoin’s Hidden Price Zones: Key Levels Investors Need To Watch,"A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst tugbachain sheds light on an important aspect of Bitcoin market behaviour — the UTXO Realized Price Age Distribution. This metric plays a significant role in understanding the holding patterns of different investor groups and the market’s response to price fluctuations. The realized price, calculated as the Realized Cap divided by the total supply, is pivotal for identifying cost bases among long-term holders and recent buyers. According to tugbachain, the realized price levels for one-month and three-month periods often serve as critical zones during bull market corrections. These levels provide a lens through which market sentiment, especially among smaller investors, can be analyzed, offering insights into the underlying dynamics that drive buying and selling activity. Related Reading: Is $135,000 Bitcoin’s Current Ceiling? This Model Says So Key Support Levels For BTC The analyst identifies two specific realized price levels—$75,100 and $62,400—as key cost bases for small investors. These levels are significant because they act as support zones during periods of market volatility. tugbachain noted that historically, when Bitcoin’s price tests these levels, it often triggers buying reactions, highlighting the psychological and financial influence of these price points on smaller investors. The CryptoQuant analyst also points out that these support levels reveal not only the patterns of small investors but also how their actions can be influenced, or even manipulated, in a bull market. In bullish cycles, it’s common for market dynamics to amplify fear among smaller investors, often prompting panic selling. tugbachain concluded noting: Monitoring these levels closely can provide valuable insights for making informed investment decisions. Bitcoin Market Performance Meanwhile, Bitcoin has just renewed its all-time high (ATH). So far BTC’s peak stand at $94,784. However, at the time of writing, the asset has retraced slightly away from this peak with a current trading price of $94,523 albeit still up by 3.1% in the past day. While the asset has seen consistent upward momentum in recent weeks, CryptoQuant has shared an interesting analysis on whether it is time to sell or still hold BTC in a recent post on its official X account. Citing major key metrics, CryptoQuant mentioned BTC’s MVRV ratio. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market Is Still In An ‘Healthy Growth’ Phase, Says Analyst—Here’s Why According to the on-chain data provider platform, historically, an MVRV ratio greater than 3.7 suggests that Bitcoin has marked a market top.

36654692,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654086,1732174234,Leveraged Bets On Ethereum Soar: What This Means For Traders and Investors,"The Ethereum (ETH) market may now be heading for a significant shift in momentum as its derivatives market continues to exhibit unprecedented growth. Particularly, while Bitcoin’s price action remains a dominant force in the market, Ethereum’s derivatives activity suggests that it could be gearing up for notable upward momentum. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Undervalued? Investors Hold Firm While Price Targets Rise New Highs In ETH Open Interest And Leverage Ratios According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant’s EgyHash, the open interest in Ethereum has surpassed its previous all-time high, marking a 40% increase in just four months and exceeding the $13 billion threshold. The surge in open interest, which represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, reflects a growing engagement among traders and institutions in Ethereum’s market. Alongside this, EgyHash also mentioned that funding rates have turned moderately positive, signalling that long-position traders are currently dominant. This aligns with a sentiment favouring further price increases for ETH in the short term. The rise in open interest is not the only indicator of Ethereum’s increasing activity in derivatives markets. The CryptoQuant analyst pointed to Ethereum’s estimated leverage ratio. EgyHash disclosed that this metric which is calculated as the ratio of open interest to the exchange’s coin reserves, has also reached a new all-time high of +0.40. Commenting on what these rising metrics means for market participants, the CryptoQuant analyst wrote: While these trends underscore positive market sentiment toward ETH, it would be prudent to remain mindful of potential risks. The elevated leverage and dominance of long positions could increase the likelihood of a long squeeze if sudden price volatility occurs, potentially leading to market corrections. Ethereum Market Performance Regardless of the positive key metrics, Ethereum has continued to be one of the underperforming crypto in the market especially when compared to Bitcoin. Particularly, while Bitcoin has consistently being breaching major resistance to hit new highs, ETH still remains 36.2% decrease away from its all-time high of $4,878 registered in 2021. However, as of today, the asset seems to be gearing up for an uptrend. At the time of writing, Ethereum has surged by 0.9% in the past day with a current trading price of $3,112. Renowned analyst known as Ali on X has recently shared his outlook on the asset noting that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin soon. The analyst backed this statement citing several key metrics and trends. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Challenges: Will It Find Traction Soon? According to Ali, the altseason indicator is flashing buying opportunity and ETH’s MVRV momentum nears a key moving average suggesting significant upside potential. The analyst also mentioned the spot exchange-traded flows (ETF) Inflows and increasing whale Activity. Ali then suggested that Ethereum could test $4,000 and $6,000 levels based on an ascending parallel channel. He also highlighted a bullish theory on ETH’s potential to hit $10,000. But there is another bullish theory!#Ethereum could be mirroring the price action of the S&P500, which puts a $10,000 target on $ETH.https://t.co/ifn1zGnn9x — Ali (@ali_charts) November 19, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/leveraged-bets-on-ethereum-soar-what-this-means-for-traders-and-investors/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/36654692.jpeg

Garlinghouse also discussed how Ripple, and the broader digital asset industry, fit into the upcoming regulatory landscape expected under President-elect Donald Trump in the coming year. Ripple CEO Optimistic About Trump’s Pro-Crypto Stance Garlinghouse emphasized that since its inception, Ripple has focused on addressing the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, which he described as “slow and expensive.” By utilizing XRP, the company aims to streamline these transactions, making them faster and more cost-effective. However, the CEO criticized the Biden administration’s stance on digital assets, referring to it as an “unlawful war” against the industry. He expressed optimism that with Trump’s pro-crypto approach, the landscape may be transforming. Related Reading: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Options Surge: December 20 Call Signals BTC Price Target Of $180,000 When asked about the potential for increased revenue opportunities in the US under the upcoming regulatory changes, Garlinghouse explained that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against XRP had effectively “frozen” Ripple’s market potential in the country. Currently, 95% of Ripple’s customer base is located outside the US, with Garlinghouse pointing out that the company cannot fully realize growth in a market where regulatory clarity is lacking. Garlinghouse observed that while the cryptocurrency industry is flourishing in countries like China, Japan, the UK, and Switzerland, the US has lagged behind in embracing digital assets. Ripple’s CEO expressed hope that the anticipated deregulation under Trump would lead to clearer guidelines, allowing agencies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to play a constructive role in shaping the industry. Garlinghosue criticized the existing regulatory framework, particularly the application of the Howey Test, which he believes fails to adequately address the unique characteristics of the crypto sector. He also underscored the need for updated regulations that reflect the realities of an industry that has developed significantly over the past decade. US As Digital Asset Hub In Coming Years During the interview, FOX Business highlighted comments from Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer, Faryar Shirzad, regarding the private meeting between Trump and Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase. Shirzad noted that Trump has expressed a willingness to engage with the crypto industry, fostering a vision for the US to become the global leader in digital assets. Garlinghouse echoed these sentiments, recognizing Coinbase’s influential role in advocating for the cryptocurrency agenda during the election campaign. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Driven By U.S. Coinbase Investors – Top Analyst Shares Metrics As speculation mounts regarding potential candidates for the SEC chair position under Trump—names like Dan Gallagher, Teresa Goody, and Commissioner Mark Uyeda have surfaced—Garlinghouse emphasized the importance of the new chair working collaboratively with Congress to address regulatory gaps that contribute to confusion in the market. Garlinghouse concluded with an optimistic outlook, stating that he believes a new era for cryptocurrency is on the horizon in the US. He envisions the country becoming a central hub for digital assets and blockchain technology over the next five to ten years. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.10, marking a massive 104% surge in just two weeks since Trump’s election victory. However, the token is still trading 67% below its all-time high of $3,040, which it reached nearly seven years ago.

The leveraged ETF is designed to two times or 200% of the daily performance of MSTR's share price.  The crypto market right now is like a roller coaster racing ahead and then adding a few extra loops for good measure, pushing the thrill and risk to new heights.  With bitcoin {{BTC}} on the run toward the $100,000 mark, traders are using options tied to an already leveraged 2x long exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to bitcoin holder MicroStrategy's share price to amplify gains.  The Defiance Daily Target 2X Long MSTR ETF, trading under the ticker MSTX on Nasdaq, seeks to deliver two times or 200% of the daily performance of MSTR's share price. The ETF surged 20%, briefly topping $180 on Tuesday, as MSTR jumped 10% to $473.  Meanwhile, trading volumes in options tied to the ETF blew up, with market participants piling into the deep out-of-the-money (OTM) higher strike call option at $230, according to data tracked by analytics platform ConvexValue. Deep OTM calls are cheaper than those near the going market rate of the underlying asset, offering an asymmetric payout potential.  The demand for the $230 strike call was spread across multiple expiries, including contracts set to settle on June 20, 2025. A call option gives the purchaser the right but not obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. The option allows the buyer to control a large position in the underlying asset while paying a small premium upfront, thereby amplifying potential gains.  The extreme bullish sentiment is consistent with the MSTR options market, where calls recently traded at a record premium relative to puts usually used to protect against price slides, according to data source Market Chameleon. Similar uber bullish flows have been crossing the tape on the CME, Deribit and the nascent options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, hinting at retail investor mania and build up of speculative excesses that often lead to market corrections.  The frenzied action comes as expectations for friendlier regulatory approach under President-elect Donald Trump and Fed rate cuts drive BTC higher. The leading cryptocurrency by market value set new lifetime highs above $97,000 early Thursday, taking the month-to-date gain to 38%, CoinDesk data show.  MSTR is the world's largest publicly listed BTC holder, with a coin stash of 331,200 ($3.04 billion) steadily accumulated since 2020. At one point on Wednesday, the company was the most traded U.S. stock, outpacing even Nvidia (NVDA), according to Eric Balchunas, a senior analyst at Bloomberg.

36650671,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654044,1732167039,"Countries Are Already Buying Bitcoin ‘In Huge Volumes’, Says Novogratz","Mike Novogratz, the founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings—a leading crypto investment firm listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange—has signaled a significant shift in the global adoption of Bitcoin. In a post on Tuesday via X, Novogratz declared that countries are already purchasing Bitcoin. Nation-State Bitcoin FOMO Is Real “Countries are already buying BTC in huge volumes—these are massive pools of capital entering the market. We’re witnessing global adoption at scale and the next rally could be massive. Buckle up. Caught up last week with Bloomberg TV, he stated via X. In the Bloomberg interview, Novogratz elaborated on the unprecedented interest from sovereign entities. He mentioned a close associate—the person who introduced him to BTC in 2013—who is currently in the Middle East. “He’s never seen anything like it,” Novogratz said. “He’s convincing more people to buy Bitcoin in the three days he’s been there than any time in his whole career, and they’re huge pools of capital. And so we’re seeing something globally.” Related Reading: US Bitcoin Reserve Will Push Price Above $1 Million, Expert Predicts Novogratz noted that when former President Donald Trump advocated in Nashville that he intended to be a “crypto president” and a “Bitcoin president,” it caught the attention of international leaders. “Other leaders heard that,” he remarked, suggesting that geopolitical factors could contribute to an “amazing rally” in the Bitcoin market. When questioned about the likelihood of the United States establishing a Strategic BTC Reserve under a Trump presidency, Novogratz remained cautious. “I still think it’s a low probability,” he stated. He cited the complexities of US legislative processes, emphasizing that while the executive branch or the House might show enthusiasm, the Senate often urges restraint. “That’s the role of the Senate,” he said, pointing out that Republicans do not hold a 60-seat majority necessary to push through such initiatives unilaterally. Nonetheless, Novogratz acknowledged the potential benefits of the US embracing Bitcoin at a strategic level. “It would be very smart for the United States to take the Bitcoin they have and maybe add some to it,” he suggested, adding that it would signal a commitment to being a “technology-first country, a crypto and digital asset-first country.” While he doesn’t believe the US dollar requires backing by Bitcoin, he admitted that if a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve were established, “Bitcoin heads to $500,000.” Related Reading: BitMEX Founder Predicts How Bitcoin Goes To $1 Million Under Trump He added: “If it happens in the short term without a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, it’s going to mean six, seven, eight years,” Novogratz cautioned. “Then it’s just a scramble to get the hot commodity.” He expressed concerns that such a scenario could be indicative of hyperinflation, which historically leads to societal instability. “In every country that experiences hyperinflation, the results are really crappy,” he noted. Discussing Bitcoin’s potential to rival gold as a store of value, Novogratz highlighted a generational shift in investment preferences. “The total market cap of gold is like $16 trillion,” he explained, which translates to approximately $800,000 per BTC if it were to reach parity. “When does Bitcoin become gold?” he asked rhetorically. Novogratz, who is turning 60 next week, admitted he still owns gold, calling himself “an old guy.” However, he pointed out that younger generations are less inclined to invest in gold. “Forty-year-olds own no gold. Thirty-year-olds own none,” he observed. “As we see this generational shift, Bitcoin should match gold within five or ten years, and that gets you to $800,000.” At press time, BTC traded at $93,000.

LTC could start a fresh increase if it clears the $88.00 resistance zone. Litecoin is showing positive signs from the $80 support zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $88 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $86.00 on the hourly chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $88.00 resistance zone. Litecoin Price Eyes Fresh Increase After forming a base above $85, Litecoin started a fresh increase. LTC price broke the $88 and $90 resistance levels to move into a positive zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price gained over 10% and even cleared the $95 level. A high was formed at $98 before there was a pullback. The price dipped below $88 and tested $82. A low was formed at $81.69 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $94.71 swing high to the $81.69 low. Litecoin is now trading below $88 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $85.00 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $86.00 on the hourly chart of the LTC/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $88 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $94.71 swing high to the $81.69 low. If there is a clear break above the $88 resistance, the price could start another strong increase. In the stated case, the price is likely to continue higher toward the $92 and $95 levels. Any more gains might send LTC’s price toward the $100 resistance zone. More Losses in LTC? If Litecoin price fails to clear the $86 resistance level, there could be another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $82 level. The next major support is forming near the $80 level, below which there is a risk of a move toward the $75 support. Any further losses may perhaps send the price toward the $68 support. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone.

36648559,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654034,1732163400,Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Charts Signal Potential Breakout,"Ethereum (ETH) has consolidated since November 12, when it hit a local high of $4,446. Despite Bitcoin’s impressive rally capturing market attention, Ethereum has struggled to maintain upward momentum and reclaim its yearly highs. The price action reflects a period of indecision, as ETH faces challenges in breaking through significant resistance levels that could reignite bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Outweighs Supply As LTH Enter Active Distribution Phase While Ethereum lags behind Bitcoin in performance, analysts remain optimistic about its potential for a breakout. Notably, Carl Runefelt, a prominent crypto analyst, recently shared a technical analysis suggesting that ETH is on the verge of a major move. According to Runefelt, Ethereum must push above a key resistance level to trigger a breakout and rejoin the broader market’s bullish trend. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum’s next steps will be crucial for traders and investors watching the market closely. A breakout above resistance could signal the start of a new upward phase, while continued consolidation might test the patience of market participants. With technical signals aligning and speculation building, Ethereum’s price action in the coming days will likely set the tone for its performance in the weeks ahead. Ethereum Prepares To Surge Ethereum has been underwhelming in its price action since March, struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. Despite a few notable surges, ETH has yet to achieve the breakout investors eagerly anticipate. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Expects A Retrace Before It Breaks ATH – Targets Revealed The prolonged consolidation has frustrated some traders, but an optimistic sentiment remains among those who believe Ethereum is poised for a significant rally once it clears key supply levels. Top crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared his technical analysis on X, highlighting Ethereum’s current position within a bullish flag pattern. According to Runefelt, ETH has attempted to break out of this formation for the past two weeks, facing stiff resistance at critical supply zones. However, he remains confident that it could rapidly surge to $4,150 once Ethereum breaches this level. Such a move would mark a substantial percentage increase from current prices, sparking a wave of investor enthusiasm. The fear of missing out (FOMO) could drive additional buying momentum, creating a self-reinforcing price appreciation cycle. If ETH follows this trajectory, it would confirm the bullish flag breakout and signal Ethereum’s return to a dominant position in the crypto market. ETH Price Action: Technical Details Ethereum is trading at $3,120 following several days of sideways consolidation below its recent local high of $3,446. Despite the pause in upward momentum, ETH has shown strength by surging above the critical 200-day moving average (MA), currently at $2,957, and maintaining its position above this key technical indicator. The 200-day MA is often a pivotal line between bullish and bearish trends. Ethereum’s ability to stay above it signals robust support from buyers and growing confidence in the market. If ETH continues to hold this level, it could pave the way for a bullish surge, with the first target being the local top at $3,446. Beyond that, a break above this resistance level could see ETH aiming for yearly highs near $4,000, reigniting enthusiasm among traders and investors. Such a move would likely confirm Ethereum’s return to a sustained uptrend, aligning it more closely with Bitcoin’s recent bullish performance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Reveals Target However, losing the 200-day MA as support could introduce risks of a pullback, potentially sending ETH to retest lower levels.

Leading cryptocurrency exchange HTX has launched the Crypto Gem Hunt program, where its research and investment team doubles down on identifying high-potential assets, delivering stellar returns through several 100x cryptocurrencies for its users. The platform unveiled its first Crypto Gem Hunt report, after reviewing the performance of newly listed assets over the past month. Seven cryptocurrencies, each making its first listing on the platform, achieved impressive price surges and generated substantial returns for users. *Data reflects performance between Oct 16 and Nov 19, 2024, for reference only. ACTSOL Leads Program Gainers with Early Access Advantage The standout performer in the program’s debut phase was ACTSOL (Act I: The AI Prophecy), a pioneering project blending AI and meme coin themes. Launched on October 26, ACTSOL debuted at 0.0078 USDT and skyrocketed to 0.95 USDT, marking a staggering 12,079.49% gain. HTX secured an early listing for the project, providing users a 14-day head start over other platforms—a critical advantage in capturing this wealth opportunity. Another notable gainner in the AI meme coin sector was GOAT (Goatseus Maximus), which combines AI technology with blockchain innovation. Backed by endorsements from industry leaders like a16z’s founder, GOAT achieved a 705.29% price surge after its debut on HTX, demonstrating the exchange’s foresight in identifying AI-related crypto market trends.

The price is now trading below $1.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.1380 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $1.150 resistance. XRP Price Holds Support XRP price struggled to start a fresh increase above the $1.150 and $1.180 levels. It started a downside correction and traded below the $1.120 level. It underperformed Bitcoin and struggled like Ethereum in the past two sessions. The price is now trading below $1.120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.1380 level. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.1380 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $1.150 level. The next key resistance could be $1.1680 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.2747 swing high to the $0.9988 low. A clear move above the $1.1680 resistance might send the price toward the $1.200 resistance or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.2747 swing high to the $0.9988 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.2250 resistance or even $1.2320 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $1.250 or $1.265. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $1.1380 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.100 level. The next major support is near the $1.0650 level or the triangle’s lower trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.0650 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.020 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.980 zone.

BTC traded above $97,500 in early Asian hours, less than 3% from a landmark $100,000 figure that would push it above a $2 trillion market capitalization.  It has added nearly 30% in the past 14 days, data shows, driven by a pro-crypto government in the U.S. and a fresh round of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve that brought back risk appetite among traders. The run is being colloquially termed a “Trump trade” among traders, with all asset classes from stocks to bond gaining since Donald Trump’s election win.  Swift interest in the newly-offered BlackRock IBIT options, which track bitcoin prices and are physically settled, and a pro-crypto cabinet serve as a bedrock for the latest run.  As CoinDesk first reported Wednesday, the Trump transition team is considering Teresa Goody Guillén, partner at law firm BakerHostetler and co-lead of its blockchain team, among several candidates to become the next SEC chair, industry sources said.  Meanwhile, IBIT options launched to a $2 billion milestone on their first day, indicative of a shifting market structure.  “The options market for BlackRock's BTC spot ETF (IBIT) made a strong debut, trading an astounding 73k contracts within the first hour on Tuesday with a bullish call-to-put ratio of 4.4:1,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram message earlier Thursday. “This activity places IBIT among the top 20 most active non-index options, underscoring the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a mainstream asset class.”  “This market response is likely to attract new investor cohorts and enable diversified trading strategies, which could help reduce both volatility and downside risk, solidifying Bitcoin’s place in mainstream markets,” they added.

36645555,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654023,1732158025,"Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Test Of 0.786 Fibonacci Level, What Happens Next?","The Dogecoin price has been trading sideways for the past few days, consolidating around the $0.4 mark as it targets a breakout to the upside. This $0.4 price point is represented by the 0.786 Fibonacci level, which an analyst has confirmed that Dogecoin continues to test in order to witness a price rally. Dogecoin Price Targets 0.786 Fib Breakout Kevin, a Dogecoin analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has shared his analysis of the DOGE price action, highlighting a key resistance point that could catalyze the meme coin’s anticipated rally. Given the recent surge in the Dogecoin price this month, many analysts have forecasted that the meme coin is gearing up to hit the $1 ATH. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Possible 40% Crash For XRP Price With Gravestone DOJI Candle Formation Some of these analysts have also suggested that factors like Donald Trump‘s win in the U.S. Presidential election, Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E commission, and growing positive sentiment in the crypto community, could become the critical drivers for the Dogecoin price, pushing it to new highs. Despite this bullish sentiment, the DOGE price continues to trade sideways, struggling to break through the $0.4 price. Kevin has disclosed that the $0.4 mark is a crucial resistance level for Dogecoin, representing the 0.786 Fib. He highlighted that the Dogecoin price has been testing this critical Fibonacci level but was sharply rejected on November 19. This price rejection is also among several failed attempts in the past few days, as Dogecoin has repeatedly tested this crucial level. While the optimism for a Dogecoin price surge is high, Kevin has stated that unless the meme coin can break above this crucial resistance level “cleanly and violently,” there’s no reason for investors to expect any major price movement or get overly excited about a potential rally. The Dogecoin analyst also highlighted a critical resistance level for the Bitcoin price. Kevin has revealed that Bitcoin’s next upside rally will occur once it clears the resistance level at $100,000. The analyst suggests that the market will likely move slowly and remain relatively uneventful until the pioneer meme coin can break past this crucial milestone. Dogecoin Next Target: Monthly Close Above $0.335 In another X post, Kevin explained the downside target for the Dogecoin price if it fails to break the 0.786 Fib resistance level. He revealed that the DOGE price moment, via its chart, is showcasing a “nasty triple top” at the macro 0.786 Fib level. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Surge To $138,000 Before Recording A 30% Crash Kevin has predicted that a drop to the $0.30 mark is highly possible for Dogecoin if volatility and market uncertainty persist. This decline could also be triggered by selling pressures and a lack of bullish momentum. Conversely, the analyst has revealed that the next big rally for Dogecoin could be seen if the meme coin can close a monthly candle above $0.335 in the next 11 days. Kevin has stated that achieving this feat would be a significant milestone, marking Dogecoin’s highest monthly candle close of all time.

BTC is showing positive signs and might continue to rise above the $95,000 level. Bitcoin started a fresh increase above the $92,000 zone. The price is trading above $92,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $93,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $95,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Sets Another ATH Bitcoin price remained supported above the $91,000 level. BTC formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $92,000 level. It cleared the $94,000 level and traded to a new high at $94,980 before there was a pullback. There was a move below the $94,200 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,500 swing low to the $94,980 high. However, the price is stable and consolidating near the $94,200 level. Bitcoin price is now trading above $93,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $93,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $94,800 level. The first key resistance is near the $95,000 level. A clear move above the $95,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $98,000. A close above the $98,000 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $100,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $102,000 resistance level. Another Downside Correction In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $95,000 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $93,700 level. The first major support is near the $92,800 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,500 swing low to the $94,980 high. The next support is now near the $91,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $90,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $93,800, followed by $92,800.

36642401,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654062,1732152632,Upbit Listing Sends BONK Skyrocketing 67% For A Fresh ATH In Memecoin Mania,"BONK, the Solana-based meme coin, has been making headlines with its extraordinary performance since listing on the largest South Korean cryptocurrency platform, Upbit. Related Reading: Poland Could Lead With Bitcoin Reserve, Presidential Hopeful Says Upon listing, this solid upward trend catapulted BONK to its all-time high, raising its market capitalization to an impressive $4.2 billion. The trading volume of the token increased by 77%, indicating significant individual and institutional interest. Such frenzy ensured that the memecoin became the number one meme coin within the Solana network. Nevertheless, the accompanying positive sentiments (and anxieties) will lead investors to ask whether BONK will be able to keep the pace considering the historical volatility of the market. 신규 디지털 자산 봉크(BONK) 거래지원 안내 ✅ 지원 마켓: KRW 마켓 📅 거래지원 개시 시점: 2024-11-20 12:30 예정 🔗 공지 바로가기:https://t.co/r2DhwVlJcO#Upbit #BONK pic.twitter.com/vSTAAG5cLv — Upbit Korea (@Official_Upbit) November 20, 2024 Whales Join The BONK Party Institutional investors see BONK’s promise. A recent whale transaction shows the increasing faith in this meme coin: 65.4 billion BONK tokens for $3.4 million in USDC were bought. Such big sales not only confirm BONK’s popularity but also show how it affects Solana’s bigger ecology. The rise of the token has drawn more than just whales. Blockchain data shows that the amount of people interested in BONK futures topped $53.5 million, which is around seven times the monthly low. This means that traders are betting on BONK’s rising trend, even though such assets come with risks. Technical Breakthrough Fuels Optimism The recent end of BONK’s long-term consolidation period offers traders a hopeful signal. Experts say the major causes driving the meme coin’s rise are aggressive trading and increasing buying pressure. BONK temporarily exceeded joke currencies like DogWife when its price shot to $0.00005916 for a fresh ATH. At the time of writing, BONK was trading at $0.00005364, up 67% in the last seven days, data from Bitstamp shows. Nonetheless, analytical tools suggest that the buying pressure in the market is reaching its limits. This, however, may lead to some temporary downward movement, but experts are still positive on BONK coming back after a certain period. Although the token has retraced to $0.00005684, this hasn’t dampened the community enthusiasm. Related Reading: Solana Market Cap Hits Milestone: $400 Price Target Gains Traction Bright Future For BONK And Solana More than just a viral currency narrative, BONK’s explosive expansion is a triumph for the Solana ecosystem. The buzz around BONK has refocused attention on Solana, attracting fresh users and so strengthening its reputation as a top blockchain platform. At the same time, the prospect appears to be very optimistic, showing an increase of 252% in price expectations during the next three months, and a further 185% increase in six months. While the thrill of speculation is there, veteran traders ring in their warning. As BONK rides this wave, it’s clear the memecoin is no longer just a joke—it’s a phenomenon reshaping the crypto landscape.

This milestone has ignited widespread speculation about the key factors fueling the rally, as Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines and capture investor enthusiasm. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Expects A Retrace Before It Breaks ATH – Targets Revealed Key insights from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju shed light on the drivers of this historic surge. According to Ju, this rally has been powered by Coinbase investors, with U.S.-based buyers playing a significant role. The influx of demand from these investors underscores the growing domestic interest in Bitcoin and highlights the critical influence of American market participants on global crypto trends. Adding to the excitement, market sentiment appears to be heavily influenced by the pro-crypto stance of President-elect Donald Trump. His support for digital assets has sparked optimism across the industry, potentially creating a favorable regulatory environment that could sustain Bitcoin’s growth. Bitcoin Demand Continues To Drive The Price Bitcoin demand remains remarkably strong, even as miners and long-term holders (LTHs) take profits during this rally. Despite selling pressure from these groups, BTC continues to rise, underscoring the robust market appetite for the leading cryptocurrency. This strength suggests buyers readily absorb the distributed supply, fueling Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently shared insightful data on X that highlights the driving forces behind this rally. According to Ju, U.S.-based investors using Coinbase have played a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s surge. He referenced the BTC Hourly Coinbase Premium (Volume-Weighted, USDT/USD Adjusted), which measures the difference in Bitcoin prices on Coinbase compared to other exchanges. The premium is currently positive and growing, indicating that U.S. investors are willing to pay more for BTC than their international counterparts. This trend demonstrates strong demand from U.S. market participants, likely buoyed by improving market sentiment and potential regulatory optimism. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Reveals Target If this upward momentum in U.S. demand persists, Bitcoin’s rally could extend further in the coming weeks, potentially setting new highs before any major correction occurs. However, as with all parabolic trends, traders and analysts remain cautious, recognizing the possibility of eventual pullbacks. The focus remains on Bitcoin’s strength, as buyers continue to outpace sellers, driving the market higher. BTC Setting New Highs (Again) Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $93,300, following its recent break above the all-time high (ATH) of $93,483. While this move marked a new milestone for BTC, the price has since entered a sideways range within a defined uptrend, indicating that demand continues to outweigh supply. However, the breakout above the ATH lacked significant momentum, resembling more of a small spring than a decisive rally. This suggests that bulls might be starting to lose steam. Despite this, BTC’s ability to maintain above $89,800 in the coming hours will be critical. Holding this key support level could pave the way for a surge to $95,000, aligning with broader market expectations of continued bullish momentum. Such a move would likely reaffirm confidence among investors, potentially driving further buying interest as Bitcoin eyes the psychological $100,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Outpaces Supply – On-Chain Metrics Reveal Low Seller Volume On the other hand, a drop below $89,800 would shift the short-term narrative. This scenario could lead to a retrace toward lower demand zones around $85,000, where buyers might regroup to push prices higher again.
