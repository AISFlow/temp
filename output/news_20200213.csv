42431540,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3LLh,1581637538,US DOJ Calls Bitcoin Mixing 'a Crime' in Arrest of Software Developer,"Larry Harmon was arrested earlier this week for allegedly participating in a money-laundering conspiracy worth more than $300 million in cryptocurrency involving darknet marketplace AlphaBay. However, the family of the Coin Ninja CEO claims he was never involved with AlphaBay.      Harmon’s case raises pressing questions about developer liability in the crypto industry.      In addition to the crypto media site Coin Ninja, Harmon created the bitcoin (BTC) mixer Helix, which sends transactions out in mixed batches so individual payments are harder to trace. In its indictment, Department of Justice prosecutors refer to Helix as a “money transmitting and money laundering business.”      “Helix enabled customers, for a fee, to send bitcoins to designated recipients in a manner which was designed to conceal and obfuscate the source or owner of the bitcoins,” the indictment continues. “This type of service is commonly referred to as a bitcoin ‘mixer’ or ‘tumbler.’”      In a statement Thursday, Justice Department Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski made the department’s views on bitcoin mixers clear. “This indictment underscores that seeking to obscure virtual currency transactions in this way is a crime,” he said.      Harmon’s brother and Coin Ninja coworker, Gary Harmon, said Helix did not directly partner with AlphaBay and the darknet market recommended the mixer without Larry’s permission or input. (Helix shut down in 2017; AlphaBay was seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in July 2017.)      Since the arrest, Larry’s wife Margot has received threatening phone calls and texts from unknown numbers saying the harasser knows the location of her home and she is no longer safe there, Gary told CoinDesk in an interview.      “Now our family is getting threatened because the FBI decided to tell the world that there might be money hidden with us somehow,” Gary said. “They have no proof of this and are now putting our family in danger.”      Gary said all his brother’s assets have been frozen and he was denied bail over flight-risk concerns. As such, the family has started a GoFundMe campaign for its expenses during the trial.      ”Our address is on it,” Margot Harmon said of the indictment. “At the bond hearing they alleged that he may have had some more bitcoin. So that put us at risk.”      Gary said the authorities have already confiscated all of his brother’s hardware wallets and Margot doesn’t have any more bitcoin at home.      The Department of Justice says it worked with the Belize National Police Department to search Harmon’s timeshare in Belize as well. Gary said the police “trashed” both of his brother’s homes.      Listen with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica or via RSS.    Major implications    Many bitcoin experts are concerned this could establish a precedent where simply creating a bitcoin mixer is seen, in itself, as a money-laundering conspiracy.      Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo tweeted that if this accusation was upheld by the federal court in Washington, D.C., it would be “the beginning of the end.”      Margot said her husband was interested in privacy technology, not criminal activity. She offered the example of queer people who may want to purchase porn or sex products without judgment from conservative family members.      “Larry has always been an advocate for privacy. He doesn’t know any bad guys from the dark web. He just wanted to help people have better privacy,” she told CoinDesk Thursday. “It’s a basic right we are guaranteed in the Constitution.”      The courts may decide in this case if the Fourth Amendment actually relates to bitcoin when it says Americans have the right to be “secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” Whether or not this includes a right to privacy, generally speaking, is a hotly debated issue among legal experts.      In May, the Dutch Financial Criminal Investigative Service seized and shut down the popular mixing service Bestmixer.io but other companies, such as the privacy-centric bitcoin wallet Wasabi, have built-in mixers as the backbone of their business strategy. These bitcoin wallet startups typically offer non-custodial mixers, unlike the custodial mixer Helix. The Canadian venture fund Cypherpunk Holdings is invested in both Wasabi’s parent company and Samourai Wallet, which also offers a mixing service. The public policy group Coin Center argued non-custodial mixers should not be subject to regulation because they offer user-hosted software tools. Only time will tell if the court agrees this reduces the developer's liability.

42431544,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3LTh,1581635708,Novogratz's Crypto Investment Firm Galaxy Digital Shrinks Workforce 15%,"Galaxy Digital, the cryptocurrency merchant bank founded by Wall Street veteran Michael Novogratz, has laid off 13 people, roughly 15 percent of its workforce, people familiar with the situation said.      The layoffs occurred across the board in early January, and all of the New York-based firm's business divisions – asset management, trading, principal investments and advisory services – were left intact. In other words, no business line was singled out or discontinued.      Nearly 80 people remain on staff. The company is hiring for several open positions, one source close to the company said. (None were listed on its LinkedIn page as of Thursday evening, but the source said the company is relying on inbound inquiries, recruiters and networking for prospects.) This person and another insider described the cuts as ""standard year-end"" activity.      A third source, a former employee, said Galaxy had hired people expecting the digital asset markets would develop more quickly than they actually did, and realized it had overbuilt.      Novogratz mentioned the reductions at an all-hands meeting to kick off the year, and they were ""reasonably well taken in stride,"" one insider said.      The cuts occurred just before a recent run-up in the price of bitcoin (BTC), the bellwether of the digital asset sector, which has climbed from under $7,000 at the beginning of the year to over $10,000 this week.      A spokesperson for Galaxy declined to comment.    In the red    Founded in 2018, Galaxy has yet to consistently turn a profit. Its net loss for the third quarter of 2019 (the most recent period for which figures are available) narrowed to $68 million from $77 million a year earlier, according to a securities filing.      Operating expenses fell over this period, largely because Galaxy had paid more equity-based compensation in 2018. Trading volume declined from the second quarter, in line with the market, according to the company, whose shares are publicly traded in Canada.      For the first nine months of last year, Galaxy made a profit of $58 million, compared to a $176 million loss for the comparable period in 2018. Its digital asset portfolio nearly doubled, to $133.5 million, over that nine-month period, due primarily to price increases.      In addition to trading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether (ETH), Galaxy holds stakes in high-profile startups including payments unicorn Ripple, crypto lender BlockFi, blockchain sleuthing specialist Ciphertrace, futures market Bakkt and industry-friendly financial institution Silvergate Bank.

The New York Times reported the Trump administration “has expressed growing concern” that this technology is being used to “evade American sanctions on countries like Iran.”      Earlier this week, the Parliament of Iran Research Center published a report suggesting cryptocurrency mining licenses issued in January could generate new tax revenue and bureaucratic fees. A related proposal by the same government-run center suggested this could bring the government upwards of $1 billion in annual revenue from the domestic cryptocurrency mining industry, which is estimated to be valued at $8.5 billion.      The report also recommends allocating a portion of the Iranian government’s 2021 budget to cryptocurrency mining, though the specifics of that proposal are unclear.      In short, if the Trump administration is trying to starve the Iranian regime into submission, bitcoin (BTC) may give the Islamic Republic a lifeline.      Mnuchin’s comments come days after the Trump administration proposed increasing the Treasury Department’s 2021 budget for cryptocurrency oversight. In 2019 alone, various U.S. government agencies spent $5 million on blockchain analytics services from Chainalysis.

42431555,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3Llh,1581627614,B2C2 Teams With SFOX Exchange to Bring Transparency to OTC Trades,"B2C2, a London-based over-the-counter (OTC) market maker, is sharing its data and allowing transactions on the Los Angeles-based exchange aggregator SFOX.      The partnership began at 10 a.m. Eastern time (15:00 UTC) Wednesday. It offers traders more access to price discovery in a thinly traded cryptocurrency market that lacks transparency. It also allows traders to view comparative pricing with exchanges and over-the-counter markets.      Price discovery is the process of determining the price of an asset in the marketplace through the interactions of buyers and sellers.      The B2C2 OTC price feeds available on SFOX are the platform’s supported BTC/USD, ETH/USD, LTC/USD and the BCH/USD trading pairs.      Estimated by research firm Alite Group to be over 65 percent of the overall cryptocurrency market, OTC trades are transactions that don't take place in a standard exchange. They generally range in size between $50,000 and $250,000 in cryptocurrency and are often much larger.    Creating market efficiencies    SFOX aggregates — that is, combines — exchange order books to give traders better pricing and help with “slippage” issues. A big problem on many cryptocurrency exchanges, slippage is when a trade participant receives a different trade execution price than expected. Adding B2C2’s OTC pricing is expected to increase liquidity, in turn helping to solve the slippage problem.      OTC trades in crypto tend to be more expensive than exchange prices. One of the reasons is that OTC desks bake in fees to price, whereas exchanges take their transactional fees at execution. The B2C2-SFOX partnership allows traders on their platform to view comparative pricing with exchanges and OTCs.    Unlocking price data    Unlike exchange-based trading, volume and liquidity are much harder to track with OTC deals since they happen via email, phone or messaging apps like Telegram or Skype. SOFX expects B2C2’s data feed will provide more transparency by offering a glimpse into the OTC market, even by showing small-sized orders.        B2C2’s software offers more flexibility than a manual desk that takes in and delivers orders. Such automation lets the firm execute trades worth as low as $1,000 around the clock, B2C2 CEO Max Boonen told CoinDesk.    All about algorithms    Though tiny trades seem arbitrary, they are many times the product of algorithms from various aggregators such as SFOX at work on exchange order books. Such regular flow of orders give better pricing information.      After going through Silicon Valley’s YCombinator startup accelerator in 2014, SFOX originally started out by providing OTC services using its algorithmic technology.      Meanwhile, B2C2 has been a player in the OTC world since 2016. However, they are more known for serving the European market.      Thus, the pairing doesn’t just give the U.S.-based platform access to OTC pricing but also a sense of where Europe is trading the largest cryptocurrency market pairs.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/13/b2c2-teams-with-sfox-exchange-to-bring-transparency-to-otc-trades,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/110d25fa1ab15fa6ab0bea091f12d1b5c19999c9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The EFF – a non-profit digital rights group – has taken up the cause of a John Doe defendant and is asking California's Marin County Superior Court to quash a motion by Kraken to identify the individual who allegedly gave the exchange a poor review on the employer rating site.      According to the EFF's court filing, the client left a review, praising aspects of life at the firm, but also saying they felt ""a deep sense of trepidation much of the time."" Kraken had originally replied and thanked the reviewer, the EFF says, but later changed tack and ""began targeting Doe and other former employees.""      According to the filing, the anonymous reviewer also checked boxes saying they would not recommend Payward, had a ""neutral outlook"" on the company and ""disapprove[d] of [the] CEO.""      The client had taken care not to disclose confidential information or defame the firm in the review, the EFF said.      In May 2019, Kraken filed a lawsuit against 10 anonymous reviewers, including the EFF client, alleging breach of severance contracts over the reviews and seeking to obtain identifying information. Kraken further emailed ex-employees ""demanding that they delete any reviews that were in violation of the severance agreement,"" said the EFF.      According to EFF staff attorney Aaron Mackey, the lawsuit is intended to ""harass and silence"" both current and former employees at Kraken who wish to talk publicly about their experiences at the firm.      “Kraken’s efforts to unmask and sue its former employees discourages everyone from talking about their work and demonstrates why California courts must robustly protect anonymous speakers’ First Amendment rights,"" Mackey said.      The EFF's client is said to have deleted their review despite feeling it did not break the severance agreement.      ""In the cryptocurrency industry, security and reputation are paramount. Like its peer companies, Kraken uses confidentiality and severance agreements to protect the platform's security and its reputation,"" Jesse Powell, co-founder and CEO of Kraken, told CoinDesk in a statement.

Volumes have risen sharply over the past three weeks from $750 million to above $4.5 billion, according to data from Skew Markets. During that time, ether’s (ETH) price rallied by nearly 70 percent, from $160 to $280.       The surge in trading volumes and prices shows renewed interest in ether and alternative cryptocurrencies in general, as a large amount of altcoins are built on ethereum.       “It seems the market has been gradually warming up and willing to revisit altcoins this year after a long sequence focusing on bitcoin and upcoming halving,” Emmanuel Goh, co-founder and CEO of Skew Markets, told CoinDesk.

42383286,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v2gV,1581607684,Here's How to Inspect Bitcoin's Next (Likely) Major Upgrade Yourself,"As the bitcoin community gears up for its next likely major code upgrade, students of the cryptocurrency have an opportunity to inspect the changes themselves, with help from core developers.      The weekly Bitcoin Core review club has started guiding users through the proposed Taproot/Schnorr code, designed to improve privacy and scalability and boost smart-contract usage for the largest crypto by market cap.      Bitcoin's (BTC) code is open-source, so anyone can scan proposed changes. Reviewing code is one of the best ways new contributors can dip their toes into the complex world of making improvements to bitcoin at the base layer.      But few people are familiar with the process, which can be tricky to learn from scratch. Developer John Newbery started the weekly club last year in an effort to teach more developers to review proposed changes to bitcoin's code.      The club meets Wednesdays on the old-school chatting service Internet Relay Chat (IRC). A host usually starts the meeting with a description of a change, then lurkers jump in with questions to get a better idea of how the code works and the motivation behind it.      Newbery has been contributing to Bitcoin Core – the basic version of the bitcoin software from which other customized implementations are derived – since 2016.      This week's inaugural Taproot/Schnoor chat covered ""some small changes to script [execution]"" from two ""pull requests"" (PRs). PRs are proposed changes that aren't quite ready to be added to bitcoin.      Once a PR is submitted, developers will look over it, to approve, reject, or leave feedback so the change can make it to the next step.      The changes discussed this week were ""small, non-behavior-changing modifications to script execution,"" according to club notes. They touch an important piece called ""consensus code,"" which are the rules that all bitcoin nodes need to follow to prevent the network from splitting into two.      ""Generally, for consensus code,the 'if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it' rule prevails,"" the review club notes explain. But in this case the changes might be warranted because it ""simplifies the changes for Taproot significantly.""      For those who are new to the process, it might not be easy to make a judgment about the quality of the code. But it could be a springboard to diving into the code further.      The club website does not say what pieces of the Taproot/Schnorr code will be covered next. The timetable for the upgrade itself is uncertain; some hope it will get done by the end of the year, but others call that overly optimistic.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/13/heres-how-to-inspect-bitcoins-next-likely-major-upgrade-yourself,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d58374b351fee54af4f1a58ae71b91c7140251f6-953x741.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383275,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v2Q9,1581607506,Torus Launches to Bring One-Click Login to Web 3.0,"Torus, a key-management startup offering one-click logins for decentralized apps (dapps), launched out of beta Thursday and announced eight initial hosting partners for its Web 3.0 product.      Alongside Torus itself, Binance, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Etherscan, Matic Network, Ontology, Skale, Tendermint Core and Zilliqa will be running nodes supporting the decentralized login system.      The move positions Torus among a handful of startups offering simple login solutions for the web’s next, decentralized chapter.      An emerging vision of the internet, Web 3.0 enables users to hold personal data independently of major corporations without sacrificing speed or efficacy. To date, however, using such services has been clunky at best.      Like cryptocurrency itself, users are still required to hold a private key to login into dapps – a stick in the spokes for most consumers who are liable to lose the string of letters and numbers comprising a private key.      Torus confronts this reality by combining mainstream login applications with private keys, Torus CEO Zhen Yu Yong said in a phone interview.      Torus raised a $2 million seed round in July 2019, led by Multicoin Capital and joined by notables including Coinbase Ventures and Binance Labs. Yong said Torus allows users to log into any Web 3.0 application with the same speed as the current internet’s OAuth protocol, without compromising security.      Torus is also available for Web 2.0 applications such as Google and has recently added five one-click partners including Facebook, Twitch and Discord, Yong said. The startup has over 100 total partnering applications to date.      Notably, users can send crypto to friends who do not yet have a crypto wallet. ERC-20 tokens can be sent via Gmail, for example, and claimed once the recipient creates an account with the startup.    Login race    Unlike other decentralized login startups, Torus does not sacrifice censorship resistance for usability, Yong said.      “The difference between us and [other projects] is they are all using a password manager model,” he said. “While they can’t outright keep your key, it's not quite censorship-resistant – they can withhold your key from you.”      Implementing its own version of decentralized custodianship, private keys are broken apart and stored on the network’s node partners as opposed to one central entity, Yong explained. Binance and others will receive portions of fees from subscribing dapps such as crypto exchange DDEX, he added.      Yong said Torus is looking to add more partners in the coming year as well as issue a token for the network, although he declined to give a definitive timeline.",POSITIVE,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | ENS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/13/torus-launches-to-bring-one-click-login-to-web-30,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/263f17c3548d42b0c119cf2e290acc7c2ce69839-1500x946.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a white paper published Wednesday, the New York-based post-trade financial services firm said participants in the financial sector should work to establish a set of ""agreed-upon standards"" that could address some of the security concerns surrounding the tech.      ""In light of the speed of digital transformation within the financial services sector, DTCC calls for a coordinated strategy for the development of a principles-based framework to identify and address DLT specific security risks,"" reads the whitepaper.      The industry consortium can more effectively identify best practices and develop baseline security procedures, the whitepaper reads. To improve its effectiveness, DTCC says standardization ""requires collaboration from professional organizations, the financial services sector, and its regulators.""      DTCC has been planning on integrating blockchain into its own operations for the past couple of years. But Wednesday's white paper argues some of the associated risks have not been adequately addressed and could leave traditional players totally unprepared.      Addressing these risks will allow firms to more easily identify potential security risks, the white paper reads. Greater security standardization may also improve overall understanding and user confidence in the technology, as well as foster greater collaboration.      By including regulators in the creation of the framework, the firm argues, will ensure alignment with future legislation that can also be a better safeguard for industry participants as well as customers.      DTCC is the world's largest trade repository, holding data for more than four-fifths of the global derivatives market. Its central role has helped standardize basic practices in traditional markets such as introducing a cost basis information framework – determining the original value of an asset for tax purposes – in equities clearing.      Although there have been some previous attempts to introduce standardized blockchain security practices, DTCC argues it can ""leverage our unique role within the financial services sector"" to begin developing a comprehensive framework that can be used by all industry participants.      DTCC has already begun the process of standardizing a new blockchain-based financial system. It effectively called on participants to adopt its guidelines, published in March 2019, for the post-trade processing of tokenized securities.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/13/dtcc-calls-on-banks-and-regulators-to-help-address-blockchain-security-issues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d87d06b7b0bf00f1c872c8e4163d7dbfadc779f9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Thursday, the new funding will help the firm expand both its product offering and geographic footprint.      “We decided to opportunistically raise the Series B to expand the balance sheet and give ourselves the ability to invest in the things we’re doing this year,” BlockFi CEO Zac Prince said in an interview.      The Series B was led by Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures with participation from repeat investors Morgan Creek Digital, PJC, Akuna Capital, CMT Digital, Winklevoss Capital and Avon Ventures. New investors included Castle Island Ventures, Purple Arch Ventures, Kenetic Capital, Arrington XRP Capital and HashKey Capital.      Having Hong Kong-based HashKey as an investor will help BlockFi expand into Singapore later this year, Prince said. While the company has been serving customers in the region, this would be its first physical presence there.      In the Asia-Pacific region, BlockFi expects to attract a lot of institutional customers, Prince said, given the number of mining companies, asset managers, exchanges and market makers that exist there. BlockFi also plans to begin attracting more retail customers in the region as it translates its site and products into local Asian languages.      In the first quarter of this year, the startup plans to develop a mobile app and the ability to send fiat wire transfers. In Q2 2020, BlockFi plans to offer Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments.      It also expects to double the size of its 75-person team by the end of 2020, Prince said.      BlockFi has been providing fiat loans with bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) collateral since the beginning of last year. In March, it launched a service offering clients interest on their crypto, which the company then loaned out to institutions. BlockFi has had to cut rates more than once because borrower supply has not been able to meet depositor demand.      The firm reports having more than $650 million in assets on its platform, a 160 percent increase from the $250 million in assets it reported in August, with a 0 percent loan loss rate.

42383278,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v2VB,1581598800,Wells Fargo Invests $5M in Startup Connecting Crypto Exchanges and Banks,"Banking giant Wells Fargo is backing blockchain forensics firm Elliptic.      Announced Thursday, the fresh $5 million from Wells Fargo Strategic Capital (WFSC) brings Elliptic’s Series B up to a total of $28 million. The investment is partly geared toward a recently launched product that helps crypto exchanges win banking relationships, Elliptic said.      The product, Elliptic Discovery, provides a bill of health for over 200 crypto exchanges worldwide, covering everything from how they conduct know-your-customer (KYC) checks to whether they’re regulated in the first place.      “Previously, a bank just didn't know much about the exchange that was wanting to open an account with them,” Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CoinDesk. “This will give them insights into how risky or otherwise a given crypto exchange is.”      Almost all big banks have avoided crypto businesses because the perceived risk of dealing with potentially unsavory transactions was thought to outweigh the benefits. The job has been left to a handful of smaller financial institutions, including the U.S.-based Silvergate and Signature banks.      Helping banks hook up with exchanges is a use case that's probably underappreciated, said Robinson. “Elliptic Discovery really does help a bank to engage more closely with crypto exchanges,” he said.      Crypto sleuthing firms like Elliptic and similarly bank-backed Chainalysis are thought to have a bright future, with law enforcement agencies doubling down on crypto and industry regulations becoming clearer.      Wells Fargo is not the only bank to have taken an interest in Elliptic, but it is the first one from the U.S.      Last September, Japanese banking group SBI Holdings invested $10 million to help drive Elliptic’s Asian expansion plans. Other investors include Santander InnoVentures, SignalFire, AlbionVC and Octopus Ventures.      “We are excited to invest in Elliptic and to help them execute the next phase of their business plan,” said Basil Darwish, managing director for strategic investments at Wells Fargo, in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/13/wells-fargo-invests-5m-in-startup-connecting-crypto-exchanges-and-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4feedd9216044ac61a1e86b34bccd83606fceca7-2560x1921.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383292,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v2mn,1581588574,$400 Drop: Bitcoin Faces Further Downside After Rejection at Price Hurdle,"View          Bitcoin's (BTC) daily and four-hour chart indicators are reporting buyer exhaustion. That, coupled with a bull failure at $10,500, has opened the doors for a correction to a rising trendline at $9,900. A violation there would expose next support at $9,707.  A bounce from the rising trendline support will likely yield another rally to $10,500.  The overall bull case will remain valid as long as prices are holding above support near $9,100.    Bitcoin could be staring deeper losses, having faced rejection at key price hurdle on Thursday.      The top cryptocurrency by market value was seeing bids around $10,400 during the Asian trading hours. Buying interest weakened after the cryptocurrency failed to stay above Wednesday's high of $10,500 and prices fell sharply to $10,077 around 08:30 UTC.      Bitcoin is currently trading near $10,200, representing a 1 percent drop on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Overall, the trend remains bullish, with prices still up 42 percent on a year-to-date basis and trading well above the 200-day average at $8,867. However, the $400 drop seen earlier is suggestive of buyer exhaustion, as it was preceded by repeated failure at $10,500 and accompanied by an overbought reading on the money flow index.      As a result, deeper correction to levels below $10,000 cannot be ruled out.    Daily chart    Wednesday's green candle has been engulfed bearishly by today's retreat from $10,500 to $10,077.      Alongside that, the RSI has produced a lower-highs pattern over the last three days, contradicting the higher highs on price, a bearish divergence that often precedes notable corrections.    4-hour chart    Bitcoin charted multiple four-hour candles with long upper wicks in the last 24 hours, indicating bull fatigue in the range of $10,400-$10,500.      The downward move seen at press time has confirmed the weakening of bull momentum and shifted risk in favor of a slide to the ascending trendline support, currently located near $9,900. That level is also housing the ascending 50-candle moving average.      Supporting the case for a correction is the lower highs (negative divergence) on the relative strength index. Additionally, the MACD histogram is about to cross below 50 in favor of the bears.      If the ascending trendline support caves in, a further decline toward $9,706 could be seen. That level is crucial as it marks the low of a major bullish engulfing candle created Feb. 11.      The bulls would breathe a sigh of relief if the trendline support holds and, if so, would likely mount another charge on $10,500. The overall trend will remain bullish as long as prices are holding ground above $9,075 (Feb. 4 low) keeping the higher-lows setup intact.

Created in partnership with blockchain firm Chiliz, the Barça Fan Tokens ($BAR) will be used to allow fans to vote in polls and surveys on Chiliz' mobile app, Socios.com.      Barça has one of the largest supporter bases globally and is the richest soccer club by revenue. Unusually, it's in part managed by a group of paying supporters called socios, who take part in elections for the president and the board. The team has achieved a record-breaking 74 trophies in its home nation of Spain.      ""With over 300 million fans worldwide, Barça's fandom spans countries as well as cultures,"" according to Alexandre Dreyfus, Chiliz and Socios CEO and founder. ""The club is without a doubt the most renowned and the most supported football club in the world and we can't wait to see their fans start to influence club decisions.""      In an announcement Thursday, Chiliz said supporters interacting with the club via its app will be rewarded with points that can be swapped for merchandise and club experiences. Other features are planned for token holders, including chat, token trading, games and more.      Forty million of the club's new token will go on sale in Q2 2020 at a cost of €2 (US$2.18). To get their $BARs, fans will need first to own Chiliz' $CHZ token, which is available from a number of exchanges worldwide, according to the firm.      The move into the blockchain space comes as part of Barcelona's global expansion strategy as it seeks new digital means to build fan engagement.

The Blockchain Education Alliance is part of MouseBelt's university program, an initiative to train the next generation of blockchain developers in more than 80 student associations all around the world. Members provide funding and educational resources that help students and professors develop curriculums and stay up-to-date with industry developments.      ""The members all share our ethos: The best way to invest in the space is to make long-term investments in education,” said Ashlie Meredith, director of MouseBelt University. ""The better the education, the better developers and projects we will see.""

Warren Paul Anderson, head of developer relations at Ripple's Xpring, which provides tools and funding for developers and startups working with XRP, said joining the alliance allowed it to prepare prospective developers with the skills and resources they need.      “Mousebelt’s mission to promote blockchain technology at the curriculum level within universities is directly aligned with that of Xpring,"" he said.

42383272,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v2Ot,1581552917,Could a Digital Dollar Compete on Privacy? Fed Chairman Powell Hints It Might,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has given advocates of financial privacy a glimmer of hope – and hinted at how the U.S. might competitively position a future digitized dollar.      In testimony before Congress this week, Powell was asked whether the Fed had any “visibility” into China’s progress developing a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      “Yes, we certainly have that,” Powell said. “But they’re in a completely different institutional context. For example, the idea of having a ledger where you know everybody’s payments, that’s not something that would be particularly attractive in the United States context. It’s not a problem in China.”      These were welcome words to those spooked not only by authoritarian China’s approach but also the potential privacy risks posed by Libra, the proposed digital currency originated at Facebook, a company that has paid billions in fines for abusing customer data.      “Powell implied that any digital currency implemented in the U.S. would have to be privacy-preserving or privacy-respecting, and not provide another method of surveillance ala the Chinese government’s plans for a CBDC that provides the government with a backdoor to surveil transactions,” said Elizabeth M. Renieris, a fellow at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.      “This should be reassuring to Americans who otherwise find themselves increasingly at risk of widespread government surveillance through their mobile location data, facial recognition systems, and law enforcement access to social media activities,” Renieris said in an email.      Rainey Reitman, chief program officer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, similarly approved of Powell’s acknowledging “the very real risks of attempting to create a state-run cryptocurrency here in the United States.""      ""Records relating to your financial transactions can hold clues to everything from your medical conditions to your political affiliations to your location at a given time,” Reitman said in an email. “As we look at cryptocurrencies and an overall societal shift toward digitizing our financial transactions, it's vital that we build privacy values into both the technology and the regulatory systems.”    Proceeding cautiously    To be sure, Powell indicated the Fed is still in the early stages of researching digital currencies, and was noncommittal on whether the central bank would ever issue one.      “Having a single government currency at the heart of the financial system is something that has served us well. It’s a very, very basic thing, it really hasn’t been in question, and I think before we move away from that, we should really understand what we’re doing,” he said. “Preserving the centrality of a central, widely accepted currency that is accepted and trusted is an enormously important thing.”      This was consistent with his prior remarks, as recently as December, which came as another relief for Renieris.      “Realistically, this means it may be many more years before the Fed reveals any details of its research and development on a digital dollar to date, as we hope there would be many rounds of public consultation before any kind of official announcement or rollout,” she said. “That is, unless we really do go the way of China and implement this top-down.”    Selling point    But Powell was not the first Washington veteran to bring up privacy in the context of a potential digital dollar.      Christopher Giancarlo, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and now an advocate for an electronic greenback, touted U.S. constitutional protections as a differentiator.      In a recent video interview with CoinDesk, Giancarlo described a scenario where a digital dollar was competing against an electronic yuan and against Libra.      “One government is going to want to know every transaction, especially transactions to political opponents, freedom movements,” he said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. “One of those operators is going to want to know every commercial transaction to know whether you're shopping with Target or you're shopping with Nordstrom. And one of those providers is going to be constitutionally restricted from collecting either of that information. And that one is going to be the U.S. government.”      Hence, “people could see a [U.S] digital dollar as your information being more secure, not less, than a central bank currency offered by other governments or commercial vendors,” Giancarlo said.    The race is on    China kicked its work on a digitized yuan into high gear last year following the unveiling of the Libra project, which Beijing officials specifically cited as a competitive threat to fiat currencies.      Despite his tentativeness this week, Powell told lawmakers that Libra “really lit a fire” under the Fed to investigate the possibilities of CBDCs.      “It was a bit of a wake-up call that this is coming fast, and could come in a way that is quite, you know, widespread and systemically important fairly quickly if you use one of these big tech networks like Libra did,"" Powell told lawmakers.      That remark “suggests the Fed is even more motivated to explore a so-called ‘Fedcoin’ by the prospect of private rivals to the primacy of the U.S. dollar (along the lines of Facebook’s Libra), than it is by CBDC’s like China’s digital yuan,” Renieris said.      But if Libra was the catalyst, it shouldn’t be a model for Washington, she said.      “Given the all-time high levels of mistrust in Facebook, which is still perceived to be at the helm of Libra (despite the Libra association’s formal independence), the Fed would be wise to focus on a more privacy-respecting approach to digital money to compete with the likely bells and whistles that Facebook will provide (including the ease of in-platform use, the shiny UX, etc.),” Renieris said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,"Benjamin Powers, Marc Hochstein",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/13/could-a-digital-dollar-compete-on-privacy-fed-chairman-powell-hints-it-might,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca97166978fadb5b6512568f89a612e40ae4feed-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
