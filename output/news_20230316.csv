42421319,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpjZ,1679009938,Is Ether a Security?,"Last Thursday morning, I wondered whether I needed to write a follow-up piece about Silvergate Bank. On Thursday evening, I wondered whether my main topic should instead be about ether potentially being a security. And then, obviously, some things happened.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Registration woes  The narrative  Last week the New York Attorney General’s office sued KuCoin for operating an unregistered securities/commodities broker in the Empire State. Most of the complaint is pretty straightforward – the NYAG alleges KuCoin offered tokens that are securities under New York’s General Business Law (the Martin Act, which we’ve seen a few times before). More intriguingly, the suit alleged that ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and one that has futures products built on top of it, was also a security listed by KuCoin.  Other details include the fact that KuCoin apparently did not bother responding to a subpoena from the NYAG.  Why it matters  If ether really is a security, that means every crypto exchange in the U.S. will need to register as a securities trading platform with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and abide by a strict disclosure regime that will probably make it difficult for many, if not all, of these exchanges to continue operating. But it’s a really big if.  Breaking it down  The NYAG sued KuCoin last week under state law, alleging that ether, post-Merge, is a security under the Ethereum blockchain’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The NYAG also alleged that terraUSD (UST) and luna (LUNA) are securities, as well as KuCoin’s Earn platform. I’m not going to get into the last two – regulators have alleged for a while now that “earn” products are securities, and have settlements with various lenders to support that contention, and there are other cases looking at the terraUSD/luna ecosystem.  And not to pull a bait-and-switch on you but I have no answer to the question asked in the heading to this section. However, I did want to figure out what the result from the New York Attorney General’s suit against KuCoin could be.  Matthew Blaine, a New Jersey-based partner at the Davison, Eastman, Muñoz, Paone law firm, doesn’t think there will be much of a result.  The case is likely to end in adjudication, he said in a phone call.  “If there is any adjudication that [ether] is an unregistered security, it's not binding on any issue or things of that nature,” he said. “It really just has to be viewed in the narrow lens through which this case is proceeding.”  He compared the NYAG suit against KuCoin to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) suit against former Coinbase director Ishaan Wahi. In that suit, the SEC alleged that a number of tokens were securities but did not sue Coinbase for listing the tokens, or the token issuers themselves.  Similarly, KuCoin hasn’t sued the Ethereum Foundation, just the one exchange, Blaine said.  It’s also unclear whether the NYAG is seeking registration from these other types of entities, or indeed from other crypto exchanges operating under the New York Department of Financial Services’ BitLicense.  The NYAG did not return multiple requests for comment, including a question as to whether it would require licensed crypto exchanges to register as securities trading platforms as well.  NYDFS is, of course, the state banking and financial services regulator overseeing all crypto companies, but the regulator’s authority may be challenged by the lawsuit.  One former NYDFS official told CoinDesk that the New York Attorney General’s office and the bank regulator did not have good relations while they were at NYDFS, describing those relations as a “perennial power struggle.”  The other factor is, of course, the SEC. SEC Chair Gary Gensler is on the record (a few times now) as saying he believes proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies resemble securities. The NYAG suit against KuCoin may not lead to much precedent for the SEC, but it’s still yet another sign regulators are starting to nail down what they’re thinking.  At least one judge, however, has very little patience with how the SEC is currently approaching these questions of whether or not something is a security. Judge Michael Wiles, of the New York Southern District Bankruptcy Court, wrote a pretty scathing order explaining his approval of Voyager Digital’s restructuring plan to sell itself to Binance.US, saying the regulator was not providing any clarity for industry operators.  “If the current regulatory environment can be characterized as uncertain, the future regulatory environment can only be characterized, in my mind, as virtually unknowable,” the judge wrote. “There have been differing proposals in Congress to adopt different types of regulatory regimes for cryptocurrency trading. Meanwhile, the SEC has filed some actions against particular firms with regard to particular cryptocurrencies, and those actions suggest that a wider regulatory assault may be forthcoming.”  Repeating his oral order from March 7, the judge went on to say the SEC’s arguments were vague and that the regulator did not provide any evidence backing up its arguments that Binance.US may be operating an unregistered securities exchange or that the VGX token might be a security.  “Although the SEC contended that the Debtors somehow had to prove a negative – i.e., that the Debtors were not violating securities laws and that Binance.US is not violating registration requirements for brokers – the SEC had not even affirmatively contended that the Debtors were doing anything wrong, or that Binance.US was doing anything wrong,” the judge wrote. “Nor had the SEC offered any guidance at all as to just what it was that the Debtors allegedly were supposed to prove on these issues, or how the Debtors possibly could prove what the SEC wanted them to prove without receiving any explanation at all from SEC as to just why the Debtors’ operations, or Binance.US’s operations, might raise legal issues.”  For further reading, I recommend my colleagues Sam Kessler and Cheyenne Ligon’s article asking what it means if ether really is deemed to be a security.

Signature Bank, Stablecoins Might Benefit From Silvergate Exchange Network's Demise: Remember when there was really only one bank collapse in 2023? Those were the days. CoinDesk’s Helene Braun took a look at what the end of the Silvergate Exchange Network might mean for other companies.  The Great Banking Crisis  So the crypto industry just lost three banks that actually onboarded crypto companies: Silvergate, Silicon Valley and Signature. Their collapse has been seen by some as part of a coordinated conspiracy to de-bank crypto in the U.S., due to the timing and the explosiveness of the near-simultaneous failures.  In the aftermath, crypto companies are looking for alternatives (including CoinDesk, which banked at SVB). While this is going to be an interesting timeline in and of itself, another question may be what happens with the loss of the Silvergate Exchange Network and Signet, two tools created by Signature and Silvergate to allow crypto companies to process transactions 24/7.  Right now, Signet is still alive, but that may change if and when the FDIC sells Signature.  A Coinbase spokesperson said the exchange had contingencies in place should Signet be shut down.  ""In that hypothetical situation, there are other players in the market that could step up to fill the void. As we saw over the weekend, crypto is resilient and we would absorb this and move on just as we have in other events,” the spokesperson said.  Dante Disparte, the chief strategy officer and head of global policy at stablecoin issuer Circle, said the two services helped build crypto, though he noted that ACH transactions and wire services also remain important.  “While [Signet and SEN] may go down in history as ignominious failures, they demonstrated that banks can innovate,” he said.  Another result may be that larger banks continue to gain new business while smaller community or regional banks and credit unions lose out, Disparte said.  One such company forced to make changes was Circle, whose USDC stablecoin lost its dollar peg for an entire weekend as a result of SVB’s collapse, starting on Friday and continuing after Circle acknowledged that it held $3.3 billion, or around 8%, of USDC reserves at the bank. The stablecoin finally regained its peg earlier this week.  There's also a matter of whether or not bank regulators are forcing banks to remove crypto clients. It’s a conspiracy theory that’s taken on fresh life in recent weeks, with everyone from lawmakers to industry participants saying “Operation Choke Point 2.0” is real.  Recent guidance from bank regulators, suggestions that Signature and Silvergate were forced to fold due to anti-crypto animus and news of the FDIC’s demands that Signature’s bidders not acquire its crypto business have bolstered these claims.  Disparte, however, does not believe it.  “I categorically reject the idea that this is Choke Point 2.0,” he said. “For one thing, [the original, Obama-era] Choke Point was covert, [but] this is overt … some companies create an unbankable asset.”  Other individuals CoinDesk has spoken to, including legal counsel at an exchange and a member of a Washington, D.C., lobbying group, also does not believe in Choke Point 2.0.  It may well be that banks are just derisking, and some crypto companies are genuinely riskier than others – Signature was reportedly under Department of Justice investigation prior to being shut down.  Austin Campbell, a Columbia University adjunct professor and former Paxos official, told CoinDesk that we may get an answer to this question over whether Choke Point is real within the next six months.  “The thing I would be watching is there's an obvious commercial voice for banks that can control risk. The crypto community should be watching to see if that's allowed, or if feds step in and block this,” he said. “If new banks step in and start servicing all these clients and onboarding them, then it's probably just a story of failures of risk.”  This week  Monday  13:00 UTC (9:00 a.m. ET) U.S. President Joe Biden addressed the banking events of the past few days.  14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. ET) There was a BlockFi bankruptcy hearing.

Jack Schickler reports that BlockFi withdrew its motion without prejudice while the parties work on a potential compromise. A complicating factor may be the fact that the U.S. Department of Justice is also looking to seize the shares under a forfeiture motion.  Wednesday  18:00 UTC (2:00 p.m. ET) There was a Genesis bankruptcy hearing.  18:00 UTC (2:00 p.m. ET) U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) spoke about the need for bipartisan legislation on crypto, saying a bill may be introduced in the coming weeks.

42421318,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnphV,1679006913,Bitcoin Ordinals Custody Solutions Would Be Better if They Embraced Bitcoiner Values,"Casey Rodamor’s Ordinal project has grown from a niche interest to an accelerating technology that’s captured the attention of collectors and developers in and out of the world of Bitcoin. Like them or hate them, Ordinals are – at least at time of writing – experiencing hockey stick-like growth.  It is still early days for the project – the market has not yet even picked an authoritative word between Bitcoin NFTs, inscriptions and Ordinals, though personally I prefer Ordinals – though there are signs of approaching adoption.  Johann Sheafson is a fundamentals-oriented crypto analyst and commentator, you can follow him on Twitter @0xsheafson. This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Culture Week.”  Case in point: Yuga Labs, the company that owns Bored Apes Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, Meebits, recently net 735 BTC (~!$16.5 million) from its Ordinals-based “Twelvefold” auction. Setting aside cultural judgments on whether this is a major boon for Bitcoin or an example of selling out, it represents a meaningful derisking event for Ordinals and validation of the category’s potential future growth.  Yet, Bitcoin’s product stack (including infrastructure, tools and platforms), which enables collecting and trading Ordinals, is lightyears behind those of alt ecosystems with mature non-fungible token (NFT) markets such as Ethereum and Solana.  For example: custody. For Ordinals collectors who haven’t spent any time in existing NFT ecosystems, what follows is one early Ordinals collector’s take on the custody products available today and how they ought to evolve over the coming weeks and months.  Custody for Bitcoin NFTs today  Ordinals collectors today have a few main custody options:  A hot, open-source local wallet (the Ord code on Github and a full node, Sparrow)  A custodial, closed-source web wallet (Ordswap.io, Ordinalswallet)  A cold, open-source wallet (Ledger + Sparrow)  The first option is suboptimal for the average Ordinals collector for the same reason it is suboptimal for the average bitcoin (BTC) holder. Most users don’t want to run full nodes, and Sparrow wallet – an excellent open-source bitcoin wallet that gives power users fine-grained control and visibility – is too complicated to be adopted by the masses.  The third option – using a hardware wallet along with Sparrow – confers the best “security sans trust” but, along with the first option, suffers from being too difficult and accident-prone for non-experienced users to adopt.  See also: Bored Ape-Parent Yuga Labs' Next NFTs Will Live on Bitcoin Blockchain / Web3  As is the case with NFT users from other chains, the average Bitcoin Ordinals collector will likely trade off security for convenience, and thus gravitate to option two: the worst option, and in my opinion, one we ought to actively discourage, as it undermines the central Bitcoin value of self-custody.  Custody aside, two major problems with wallets today are the lack of an easy and safe user experience (UX) for the two most common expected user behaviors: transferring and transacting.  Problem 1: Transferring Ordinals  Current wallets (outside of Ord, which requires running a full node, and interacting via the command line) offer no or half-baked support for Ordinals. Many users have accidentally sent or burnt valuable Ordinals by commingling them with their BTC in wallets incompatible with Ord.  State of transferring ordinals ux today  Problem 2: Transacting Ordinals  Thus far, most Ordinals buying and selling has required costly and trustful intermediaries like third-party escrow services. Trustless transacting is table stakes UX on smart contract-based chains and also ought to be on Bitcoin.  But why bother catering to left-curve degens from alt chains? Because the majority of growth in Ordinals will either be driven by existing NFT users or be first-time Bitcoin or crypto users. I do not think Ordinals (or Bitcoin for that matter) gets scaled growth from existing Bitcoin users alone.  Ordinals solutions should embrace bitcoiner values  As Ordinals adoption (and Bitcoin and Bitcoin application adoption) grows, the marginal user will increasingly resemble the average NFT user from communities based around Ethereum or Solana. In my opinion, products designed for this user profile should advance three main goals: friendliness, self-sovereignty and trustlessness.  Friendliness  If you believe all products should maximize control and customization at the expense of useability and cognitive friction, or that user safety and protection is for feebleminded plebs unworthy of your coin/chain, we’re not going to agree. A good mass-market custody product should be designed for the lowest common denominator user: maximize convenience and ease of use, minimize user mistakes and cognitive friction.  Self-sovereignty  That said, I draw the line at not compromising our movement’s normative maxim of “not your coins, not your keys.” Self-custody is admittedly hard: People forget or lose their passwords, seed phrases and private keys. But a product that gives on self-custody would abet the permissioned institutions we’re trying to disrupt and perpetuate the problematic behavioral patterns we’re trying to reform.  Trustlessness  Finally, we need to evolve beyond transacting via trusted intermediaries like escrow services and OTC [over-the-counter] brokers. Fortunately, well-adopted standards like Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs, from BIP 174) are already being implemented by upcoming wallets and exchanges to achieve this goal.  Gold standard custody and interacting UX  In my opinion the ideal Ordinals custody and interacting experience should feature the following:  A cold hardware wallet that holds your keys (e.g., Ledger) – bonus if it’s air-gapped from the web (e.g., Foundation Devices)  An open-source browser wallet for interacting with apps like exchanges  Ordinals compatibility on (1) and (2) so the average user doesn’t need to run Ord  The ability to import watch-only wallets from (1) into (2), required for:  A interacting flow that enables users to sign transactions (e.g., PSBTs) with their hardware wallet in (1) without exposing keys  This is, in theory, how that might would using an air-gapped hardware wallet:  Users wanting to send or interact triggers a browser wallet.  The browser wallet generates a PSBT in the form of a QR code.  The user scans this QR code with their air-gapped hardware wallet.  The hardware wallet generates a new QR code of a signed transaction.  The user scans the new QR code with their browser wallet.  That browser wallet confirms the transaction is valid and broadcasts it to the Bitcoin network.  To get wide adoption, the above should be wrapped in a friendly-to-use UX that minimizes user mistakes. (Hat-tip to @bitcoinbeezy for helping me think through this flow.)  Mass adoption  I believe Ordinals (and the technology and social consensus that enable it) represents a historic inflection point for Bitcoin that will catalyze the next leg of the network’s scaled adoption by masses of new users and applications.  See also: Bitcoin Ordinals Can Lift the Entire Crypto Ecosystem / Opinion  As of this writing, teams shipping “next-generation” consumer wallets include Hiro (PSBT support, but can’t transfer), Unisat (PSBT support, but poor UX and can’t transfer) and Oyl (not yet launched). At the advanced user and enterprise end of the market, Casa, which currently supports Ordinals transfers but has a clunky UX, and Trident Wallet will soon support Ordinals.  I intend to support the teams that advance the above “gold standard UX.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,Johann Sheafson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/16/bitcoin-ordinals-custody-solutions-would-be-better-if-they-embraced-bitcoiner-values,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d9789597958264503b85ca0315a6f66f1c31b57-2400x1899.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412625,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5SeO,1679005203,Playboy Lost $4.9M on Ether It Accepted as NFT Payments,"PLBY Group (PLBY), the parent company of the late Hugh Hefner's Playboy enterprise, said it took an impairment loss of $4.9 million on the ether (ETH) it held last year, as crypto winter created a significant decline in the broader market prices.  The lifestyle and media company said it accepted ether as payments for its “Rabbitars” non-fungible tokens (NFT) launched in 2021, which it holds in its balance sheet as digital assets, according to an annual filing on Thursday. The value of the digital assets sits at $327,000 as of last year, the filing said.  A previous filing shows the company's digital assets, which it refers to as Ethereum, were worth $1.75 million as of Sept. 30, 2022.  The company explained that the company accounts for its digital assets as “indefinite-lived intangible assets,” which are subject to impairment losses if the fair value of the assets fall below their carrying value, at any time. The impairment losses the company takes on the digital assets can’t be recovered, even if the fair value of the assets rise after taking the impairment losses.  “The market price of one [ether] in our principal market ranged from $964 to $3,813 during the year ended Dec. 31, 2022, but the carrying value of each Ethereum we held at the end of the reporting period reflects the lowest price of one Ethereum quoted on the active exchange at any time since its receipt,” according to the filing. ""Therefore, negative swings in the market price of Ethereum could have a material impact on the company's earnings and carrying value, while only time a rise in prices will impact the company’s earnings positively, is when the Ethereum held in the balance sheet, are sold at a gain,"" the filing said.  The company launched its “Rabbitar” NFT project in October 2021, during the peak of the crypto market. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, lost about 60% in value since October 2021, according to TradingView data.  Earlier in 2021, Playboy entered into NFT and blockchain technology industry with its NFT drop called “Liquid Summer,” which is a collection of digital artworks created in collaboration with the artist Slimesunday. The collection, which minted in May 2021, features archival photographs of Playboy model Lenna Sjööblom – the so-called “First Lady of the Internet.”  However, these NFT drops weren’t the first foray for the company into the world of digital assets.

42412624,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5SfK,1679004975,Lightning Labs’ Taro Project Faces Halt as Judge Issues Temporary Injunction for Trademark Infringement,"Blockchain software development firm Tari Labs sued Bitcoin infrastructure firm Lightning Labs in December for trademark infringement over the use of the name “Taro” – Lightning’s protocol that allows users to issue assets such as stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain.  On Wednesday, Judge William H. Orrick issued a temporary injunction forcing Lightning Labs to halt further development of Taro until the project has been sufficiently rebranded. In its complaint, Tari argued that it and Lightning “compete in the same digital blockchain ecosystem, provide similar, and in some instances identical, goods and services, market to similar developers and users, and appear on the same blockchain platforms.”  The lawsuit has drawn criticism from several members of the open source community who insist that trademark enforcement has no place in free and open-source software (FOSS).  “We wish we could have avoided litigation. We tried very hard,” Naveen Jain, co-founder of Tari Labs, told CoinDesk. “We are huge fans of Lightning Labs. Instead of simply changing the name, they chose to fight us tooth and nail. We are never happy or proud when things result in litigation.”  Read more: Lightning Labs Releases Software to Allow Bitcoin Developers to Mint and Transfer Assets on the Blockchain  Tari Labs launched Tari – a blockchain protocol that focuses on digital assets – in April 2020 and subsequently registered the name as a company trademark. Tari has “an Arabic or Italian etymology relating to a Mediterranean gold coin used in the Middle Ages,” according to court documents.  Two years after Tari’s debut, Lightning Labs announced Taro after raising $70 million in a Series B funding round.  “I was having dinner with a developer friend and he mentioned ‘taro,’” said Lightning Labs CEO and co-founder Elizabeth Stark in a declaration in the case. “I knew that taro is a common ingredient used in Latin American, Southeast Asian and African cuisines, which were three key regions for the growth of this technology – so, I responded, ‘Wait, that’s a really cool name!’”  A test version of the Taro software was released last September and a subsequent iteration was on the verge of being announced. The injunction, however, means Lightning’s development of Taro has been halted and Lightning Labs will have to rebrand or appeal the decision before moving forward.  “This whole thing could’ve been avoided if they changed the name,” Jain said. “I met with Elizabeth personally, we sent multiple messages and we offered to help brainstorm new names. Now with the temporary restraining order, they must change [their] name to continue shipping near term.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/16/lightning-labs-taro-project-faces-halt-as-judge-issues-temporary-injunction-for-trademark-infringement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27e22df8938acf97a46c423d8d5444051f5f1d1e-2000x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a statement posted to Discord on Thursday, Castro, known online by his alias, Poopie, discussed the brand's plans to build away from ""trends that fuel speculation"" in the NFT market.  ""We're trying to go from a startup to a leading media franchise,"" he wrote. He also pledged to focus energy on Doodles' ""most loyal collectors.""  ""We are not going to spend any resources appeasing those with financial motivations,"" he added. ""We never have and we never will.""  The statement received mixed reactions from holders who asked for clearer communications.  Others supported the measure as a way for the brand to evolve and innovate.  Several hours later, Castro posted a response to the criticism on Twitter, affirming his commitment to blockchain technology and pledging to ""continue to use NFT tech as the connective tissue between everything we do.""  He also said that Doodles aimed to ""go beyond"" the ""vicious speculative cycles"" that dominate the NFT space by creating products with market fit, solving real-world problems and bringing in ""intrinsically motivated users.""  Doodles, along with other NFT collections, has seen its floor price steadily decline in recent months. The rise of trader-focused marketplaces like Blur suggests that NFT consumers have shifted their focus to trading NFTs for profit rather than collecting NFTs for their artistic value.  According to NFT Floor Price, the floor price for a Doodles NFT sits at 3.4 ether (ETH), or about $5,700, down from a high of 21.8 ETH in May 2022. The recent news has had a negative effect on the collection's floor price, which has dropped over 8% in the past 24 hours.  Doodles was launched in October 2021 as a collection of 10,000 NFTs made up of colorful artwork by Burnt Toast, the alias of Canada-based artist Scott Martin. The project was created by Castro and Evan Keast, who previously worked together at Dapper Labs. The hand-drawn, pastel characters quickly attracted a passionate consumer audience, and holders of the project are able to access exclusive perks like access to live events and brand-related merchandise.  Over the past year, Doodles has focused its efforts on expanding its ecosystem, and brought on notable figures to help lead its creative ventures, including former Billboard President Julian Holguin as partner, and CEO and musician and producer Pharrell as the project’s chief brand officer. It also previously laid out plans for expansion across music, gaming and intellectual property (IP) partnerships and has stated that it aims to become one of the largest consumer brands in the world. In January 2023, the company acquired animation studio Golden Wolf as part of that roadmap.  “Our vision at Doodles is to be one of the world’s leading producers of media and entertainment,” the brand tweeted in June 2022. “We're building an ecosystem rich in diversity and utility.”  Interested in keeping up with Web3 news and trends?

42421335,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqmb,1679001214,U.S. Banking Collapse Doesn't Necessarily Make Crypto Trustworthy,"The world is saved in ""Superman: The Movie"" when (spoiler alert) our eponymous hero flies so quickly around the world that he turns back time and undoes a confluence of disastrous events where a nuclear missile detonated in the San Andreas Fault. (Wait, he could do that all along?)  This turn of events may have seemed familiar, as did our collective sigh of relief, when the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced extraordinary measures on March 12, to “strengthen confidence in the U.S. banking system” following the dramatic closure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).  Jess Cheng is a partner in the New York office of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and former senior counsel at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C. Amy Caiazza is a securities, fintech, and blockchain partner in Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati's Washington, D.C. office.  Does such a deus ex machina of the crypto industry exist, or could it? Should it? The Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) headlines did not revolve around crypto. However, there are important lessons for the crypto community to consider, especially as the recent instabilities in the banking system have once again prompted cries that decentralized finance can solve many of the problems raised by traditional banking and incumbent financial systems.  The Treasury, Fed and FDIC save the day  SVB was closed March 10 by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, with the FDIC appointed as receiver. Among the measures announced on Sunday were actions taken to enable the FDIC to complete its resolution of SVB in a manner that “fully protects all depositors [such that] depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13” (emphasis added).  Even deposits over the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit would not take losses under this measure. Signature Bank, which was also closed that day by the New York Department of Financial Services with the FDIC appointed as receiver, received similar treatment, with all depositors to be made whole.  Any losses to the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund to cover these uninsured deposits would be recovered in a special assessment on banks. In other words, the cost of making SVB’s and Signature Bank’s customers whole has fallen directly on the banking industry as a whole: Not customers, and not taxpayers. Regulators have stepped in but they put the financial responsibility for protecting depositors firmly with the private sector.  See also: Signature Bank’s Prospective Buyers Must Agree to Give Up All Crypto Business: Report  Importantly, there was a second measure announced on Sunday. The Federal Reserve also created a new lending facility to help ensure banks have the ability to meet the needs of their depositors, with the Treasury Dept. making available up to $25 billion as a backstop. The facility offers loans for up to one year against certain securities – including long-term U.S. Treasury bonds and government-backed mortgage securities, whose market prices have plummeted as interest rates have soared. Importantly, those assets would be valued at par, not market value. As a result, a bank desperate for liquidity would not need to sell its portfolio of long-dated securities at a loss; it could pledge that collateral for a loan at par.  The Fed can stand up this liquidity facility because it is special. Like any balance sheet, the Fed’s consists of assets on one side and equal liabilities on the other – but the Fed can expand its balance sheet in ways that other entities can’t, and central bank money is unique in that it serves as the foundation for the safety and efficiency of the U.S. payment system as a whole.  Lessons for crypto  It remains to be seen whether the measures announced on Sunday are enough to calm investors, depositors and the broader market. Just as the U.S. bank supervisory and regulatory framework may be at a crossroads, so too might the crypto community.  A challenge to consider: Can technology replicate, for the crypto markets, the effects of the Fed’s unique central bank powers, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government?  Perhaps, to some degree. It doesn’t take a central bank or finance minister (or Superman) to develop clear, well-calibrated loss allocation schemes. As a point of comparison, the concept of loss-sharing is already a fundamental principle of payment systems in that the burden of unanticipated operational losses should rest with the providers of the payment system rather than with the users of the payment system. The crypto community might consider developing clear, enforceable legal terms or system rules that leverage this fundamental loss-spreading principle – beyond operational losses and on an industry-wide basis.  But, of course, that is not a deus ex machina of crypto, which would seem to be in philosophical tension with the decentralization goals of many in the blockchain and crypto industries. Ultimately, although crypto and traditional banking may be ostensibly competing in financial services, they are living in fundamentally different realities. In the wake of the Terra and FTX collapses, there was no Superman to swoop in and undo the calamitous ramifications.  See also: Bitcoin Was Built for This Moment / Opinion  The resulting cascade of losses has undermined trust in crypto outside the close-knit community. In response, this means the crypto community itself needs to be united, vigilant and disciplined – through rigorous rules, standards and protocols that protect customers and strengthen confidence. Only by rebuilding this trust can crypto have a chance at regaining its momentum and a shot at mainstream adoption.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,"Jess Cheng, Amy Caiazza",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/16/us-banking-collapse-doesnt-necessarily-make-crypto-trustworthy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/158a64be2f70b8784b4a985952819c7022925c8e-4581x3025.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The decrease in U.S. jobless claims from 212,000 to 192,000 missed expectations of 205,000 and showed the jobs market remains overheated.  Unemployment claims remain almost identical to where they were in January, defying the U.S. Federal Reserve’s efforts to cool labor markets. Tight labor markets have historically kept wages high, which is a key inflationary factor. The central bank’s uncertainty in recent months about how to account for the strong jobs data as it considers interest rate hikes has roiled financial markets.  Meanwhile, the two largest crypto currencies by market cap have leveled off after climbing on Tuesday.  Ether has joined bitcoin in trading in a narrow range, a sign that the recent spate of volatility for both is beginning to wane. While still at levels last seen in August and November, the Average True Range (ATR) for both assets has begun a decline from their recent peaks.  The decline in ATR aligns with a reduction in trading volume. Volume can often indicate who has the loudest voice in the room among bullish and bearish investors.  While bulls certainly had the most to say between March 11 and March 14, early signs indicate they are beginning to go quiet.  This contrasts to the rapid see-sawing of expectations for the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee to raise interest rate hikes, and by how much. Over the most recent week the probability of a 50 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates has fluctuated from as low as 32% to today’s 79%.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, unveiled the release in a blog post on Tuesday, stating the latest version can pass a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. By contrast, GPT version 3.5’s score was around the bottom 10%, according to OpenAI's website.  Other AI-related tokens have also recently surged, with SingularityNET (AGIX) – a decentralized AI marketplace running on blockchain – up 16%. According to data from CoinMarketCap, “Top AI and Big Data” tokens have outperformed the largest-cap cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether over the past 24-hours.  “AI could be a threatening technology for some in the Web3 space as it immediately achieved widespread mass adoption through the launch of chat GPT almost overnight,” said Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at blockchain consultancy Storm Partners.  Ahmed added: “AI tokens are leading the charge and will likely continue to do so as AI becomes more sophisticated. AI is a fantastic opportunity for crypto and will likely form a symbiotic complementary relationship.”  The Graph is an open-sourced indexing protocol used to collect, process and store data from various blockchain applications. It removes the need for data consumers like app developers to expand complex infrastructure for gathering on-chain data. The Graph currently supports indexing data from 26 different blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Near, Arbitrium, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, Celo, Fantom, Moonbeam and IPFS.  The foundation also released its annual grants report on Thursday, outlining the protocol’s growth over 2022 and how grants have played a vital role in stimulating and developing the Graph ecosystem.

42412618,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5Sae,1678996682,Bitcoin Holds Steady Above $24.5K as European Banking Crisis Eases,"Bitcoin maintained steady above $24,500 after the Swiss National Bank seemed to head off a European banking crisis by agreeing to lend troubled investment bank Credit Suisse about $50 billion, and investors’ hopes rose that the U.S. central bank would turn more dovish at its next rate-setting meeting.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $24,791, up 1.4% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. BTC has remained largely range-bound between $24,000 and $25,000 since Tuesday afternoon when U.S. inflation data took a slight turn for the better. BTC is up 19% over the week amid renewed market optimism about the U.S. banking sector and the Federal Reserve potentially suspending its current regime of interest rate hikes.  On Wednesday, the CME FedWatch Tool, a predictor of interest rate decisions, forecast a 45% chance of a zero basis point rate hike. It’s now predicting an 80.5% chance of a 25 basis point (bps) increase. Both numbers contrast sharply from last week when the CME showed a 68% chance of a 50 bps rate boost.  ""The resilience of BTC since shows that while it's clear now that BTC is not an inflation hedge, it certainly is a hedge against monetary irresponsibility,"" Singapore-based crypto options trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram broadcast note.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was recently hovering around $1,690, up 2% from Wednesday at the same time. BNB, the native token of the Binance-initiated blockchain network BNB Chain and fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, jumped 7% to trade at $328 from roughly $300 a day ago. Indexing protocol The Graph's GRT token surged 13%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was recently up 2%.  U.S. equity markets also turned green as markets continued to digest U.S. regulators’ backstop for depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, recently rose by 1.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were up 1.8% and 0.7%, respectively.  Meanwhile, the European Central Bank continued its own monetary tightening amid rising inflation on the continent, increasing its interest rate by 50 bps on Thursday.  In a note, QCP Capital saw the move as a precursor of the Fed raising interest rates by 25 bps.  “Anything overly dovish would strike fear in markets that the Fed knows something more, while pausing would confuse the message on inflation,” QCP Capital wrote. “Central banks will be keeping up their fight against inflation while working separately on ring-fencing troubled financial institutions.”  UPDATE (March 16, 21:10 UTC): Updated latest price of bitcoin in headline and story.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/16/bitcoin-holds-steady-above-25k-as-euro-banking-crisis-eases,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89fb711fbfb259c0c3e96855007ae2bbbc0e0160-1140x620.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412620,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5SZi,1678995991,LinksDAO Inches Closer to Closing Scottish Golf Club Deal,"LinksDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for golf enthusiasts, is one step closer to purchasing a Scottish golf course, the group announced on Thursday.  The DAO has signed an exclusivity agreement with the owner of Spey Bay Golf Club, an 18-hole property located on the northern coast of Scotland. The collective expects the property will come under its ownership in the next three to four weeks, pending due diligence.  “We're extremely excited about this development for our membership, greater community and friends throughout web3 and hope to close on the property within the month,” LinksDAO CEO Jim Daily told CoinDesk.  LinksDAO declined to disclose the value of its offer, noting that the deal has not yet been fully closed. Spey Bay’s seller listed the property at $905,000, according to the property’s listing. Golf Digest has reported that the deal is expected to close higher, however, without naming a specific figure.  Money for the purchase will come from two sources: an equity funding round and $10.5 million in profits the DAO reaped from its non-fungible token (NFT) project that sold out early last year.  It remains unclear how often the DAO’s members will be able to access the course, and at what cost. The community is still “working through the details” of the course’s membership structure, a process that will include the community’s more than 5,000 members, according to Daily.  “The community's voice has been an integral part of the success of this project thus far and will continue to be as we form our physical locations,” said Daily.  Daily declined to comment on whether or not that process would include a community vote.  If the Spey Bay deal goes through, it will mark LinksDAO’s first property purchase. The organization has agreements with several clubs across the U.S. that can be accessed by its players, 80% of whom are located in the U.S., but the DAO does not yet have its own club. It is currently looking at dozens of properties with the hopes of purchasing a club in the U.S. as well.

However, the firm recently experienced its second-highest January since its 2018 founding in terms of net new assets.  The products on the chopping block include the 21Shares Crypto Layer 1 ETP (LAY1), the 21Shares DeFi 10 Infrastructure ETP (DEFII), 21Shares S&P Risk Controlled Bitcoin Index ETP (SPBTC), the 21Shares S&P Risk Controlled Ethereum Index ETP (SPETH) and the 21Shares USD Yield ETP (USDY), which will all close after the April 6 trading day. The sixth product – 21Shares Terra Classic ETP (LUNA) – will keep trading until June 12. The six closures have less than $700,000 in assets under management combined.  “It is a routine/standard practice in the ETP industry,” said the spokesperson. “While these ETPs saw relatively low demand, we're seeing continuous strong demand in our other products. In fact, we closed out our second-strongest January in company history this year.”  21Shares added $26.95 million in net new assets in January compared to the $26.73 million during the same period last year, according to the firm. The record was held by January 2021 with nearly $44 million in assets. The firm’s 21Shares Ethereum ETP (AETH) and 21Shares Bitcoin ETP both surpassed $200 million in assets under management, becoming the second and third products to cross that mark. 21Shares will also continue to offer its first fund, 21Shares Crypto Basket Index ETP (HODL).

42412622,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5SdS,1678993933,Former FDIC Regulator: Friendliness Toward Crypto 'Does Not Exist',"U.S. regulators may be using recent turmoil in the financial world as a way to kick crypto companies out of the banking system, said Jason Brett, a former regulator at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  “It’s about the friendliness towards crypto, and it just does not exist,” Brett, managing director at consulting firm Key Bridge Advisors and a Forbes regulatory analyst for digital assets, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday.  Last week, California-based Silvergate Bank said it would be “voluntarily liquidating” its assets and closing its doors. The firm, which primarily served crypto companies, also closed its SEN platform.  Two days later, Santa Clara, California-based Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a go-to institution for venture-backed tech startups, was taken over by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which said the firm had “inadequate liquidity and insolvency.” This past Sunday, New York-based Signature Bank was closed by state regulators in what they called an effort “to protect investors.” Like Silvergate, Signature Bank operated its own real-time payments platform, Signet.  The FDIC took receivership of SVB and Signature, giving the agency discretion to manage each of the bank’s assets and liabilities.  According to Brett, efforts by federal regulators to keep crypto companies from accessing the U.S. banking system may have been taking place even before the recent bank collapses.  Case in point: He mentioned former FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams, appointed by former President Donald Trump, “who was a big fan of crypto,” and who was “pushing that at the FDIC.” She resigned effective Feb. 4, 2022, according to her letter to current President Joe Biden.  She “was basically ousted in what was almost a coup d’etat,” Brett claimed, adding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) swooped in and took over the FDIC’s agenda.  “Now, you see Chairman [Martin J.] Gruenberg there at the top of the FDIC, and he has not been a fan of fintech, much less crypto,” Brett said. Gruenberg was sworn in as FDIC chairman on Jan. 5, 2023.  Yet, Brett said he “wouldn’t go so far as to say all of the banks have been shut down because of crypto.”  The latest failures in the banking industry raise some questions for regulators “about how much attention they paid,” Brett said.  “We're not in a crypto crisis. This isn't a financial crisis, yet, but this is a banking crisis,” he said. “This is a crisis of how the banks are managing their books.”  Read more: Stop Blaming Crypto for Traditional Finance Failures / Opinion",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/16/former-fdic-regulator-friendliness-toward-crypto-does-not-exist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/401734f8373099054c9ab8587c89caed24e20a46-1536x1024.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421233,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqu5,1678992776,How Talent Agency WME Is Expanding Into Crypto,"Denzel Washington. Ben Affleck. Serena Williams. Tina Fey. Rihanna. These are the types of names that are represented by WME (William Morris Endeavor), an elite talent agency that runs a good chunk of Hollywood.  Founded in 1898, WME has a roster of talent across nearly every branch of culture – film, music, television, comedy, books, art, theater. And in 2021, the firm expanded its scope to include a new vertical: crypto.  The impact of Web3, ultimately, is “going to be very similar to the way that the rise of the internet completely changed humanity,” says Chris Jacquemin, head of digital strategy of WME and the partner who led the firm’s embrace of Web3. Under Jacquemin’s watch, WME has signed more than 50 Web3 creators, building an eclectic roster that now includes Mack Flavelle (co-founder of Dapper Labs, the company behind NBA Top Shot), AI (artificial-intelligence) artist Claire Silver and pseudonymous NFT artist FEWOCiOUS.  This interview is part of CoinDesk's Culture Week. Chris Jacquemin is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus festival in April.  “I've always evaluated data and media trends,” says Jacquemin, who began his career in research and has a knack for spotting trends in tech on the early side – from DVRs to YouTube to the rise of social media. Years ago, Jacquemin started the firm’s digital media business, which led to signing podcasters, esports gamers, Web2 creators and others.  And Jacquemin saw the potential with Web3. He discovered bitcoin (BTC) over a decade ago (alas, he says he wasn't “tech savvy” enough to buy any at the time) and had been curious about the sector for years. In 2020, he asked his colleagues things like, “Have you ever heard of an NFT?” Most hadn’t. But he also knew that younger employees at WME, like assistants, were buying crypto and trading non-fungible tokens. He felt a generational shift.  Over two years later, WME continues to sign talent – even during crypto winter – who often works with existing clients on Web3 collaborations. (This is the benefit of scale. New Web3 clients can help WME’s “legacy” clients get into Web3, and the traditional arm of WME can offer new playgrounds for the Web3 clients. Win/win.)  WME is even signing Web3 developers, as Jacquemin thinks of them almost as “producers” who can help creators fulfill their vision. “There’s real value in understanding the developer ecosystem,” says Jacquemin, who is pushing the boundaries of what it means to sign creative talent. He opens up about why WME has embraced Web3, how he explains it to his colleagues, why he’s not too concerned about crypto winter and why he’s spending “an inordinate amount of my career in this area.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  When did you first explore the idea of WME getting into Web3?  Jacquemin: It was actually in the fall of 2020. My background is in research, so I really obsess over a lot of consumer trends and behavioral trends. And what I was seeing in 2020 was that everybody's at home during the pandemic and the collecting market exploded. Sneakers, coins, trading cards, stamps, you name it. And everybody was feeling isolated. There was a thirsting for community and connectivity.  And, in parallel, crypto was on fire. So it felt like this perfect storm. I stumbled on a data report that suggested that by the end of 2020, there would be roughly $300 million in NFT sales.  It reminded me of how when YouTube launched, I had made this proclamation like, ""This is going to become the most disruptive thing to happen in video we've ever seen."" This felt similar. We were seeing the emergence of a new file format and collectible construct of assets. And it tied into a generational shift that I thought was happening. It felt like, “Okay, this is all coming together. This is real. Let's go.""  How’d you pitch the idea internally, to your colleagues?  I was explaining that, “Much like you’ve heard me say many times before, technology allows creators to tell stories, using these new platforms and devices and tools. So this is just another canvas for our clients to paint on and to play in.”  We really came at it from this point of view as an opportunity to tell stories in a different medium and reach a different community.  Smart. But I’m guessing this wasn’t always an easy sell. What kind of pushback did you get?  One thing people said was, “Is this kind of a fad? Is this going to be something that goes away?” We had a little bit of that.  There was certainly a little bit of, “I don't even understand what we'd be making here. What does this look like as a creative project?” That was a big one. And there were a lot of other issues at the time that are no longer as prevalent, such as the environmental pushback.  How’d you overcome the objections?  I think one of the things that I have a good reputation for is removing a lot of the technical speak. So for NFTs, it’s, “Let’s just talk about these as digital collectibles.” And I’d tell them, “This is a theme that you’ve seen before, no different than the rare Fortnite skins that you might have bought or the World of Warcraft secondary market that was happening illegally on eBay. We’ve seen this before. And because these are familiar themes, the technology that underpins these new developments is not going away.”  Read more: How Web3 Animation Project 'The Gimmicks' Survives a Crypto Winter  And I would tell them that it’s going to be very similar to the way that the rise of the internet completely changed humanity and our access to information on a global scale. The rise of social media allowed for the world's population to connect over common areas of interests. This is another wave of that. So let's think about how it [Web3] complements a lot of the work that we’re already doing in these areas: artist fan clubs, merch as collectibles.  How’d you guys jump in?  Well, a few years before we were early-stage investors in Dapper Labs. But in 2020 there was nothing on our roster that represented Web3, if you will. And the pattern I kept seeing was that the success of so many projects tied back to particular artists, such as Beeple or FEWOCiOUS or XCOPY.  And it became very clear that this is no different, in a way, than how you wouldn’t make a television show without a showrunner or you wouldn't make a movie without a filmmaker. I saw the importance of the visual artist to be central to the success of these projects. So if you are an athlete or a music artist or a storyteller looking to get into Web3, then you should really think about partnering with these [Web3] visual artists who have a track record of building communities, in building creative projects and certainly building value in this space. And to look at them as partners, not look at them as somebody that you can pay a small fee.  It’s very analogous to how you would put together a television show or a film. So over the course of the first few months in 2021, we began to identify people like Mack Flavelle and FEWOCiOUS. We said, ""Okay, we should go sign them and build up a roster to represent them. And this will then help us as we're putting more projects together in this new area.""  Interesting. So signing Web3 clients also helps your current clients get into Web3. Smart. What are some of your favorite success stories?  I think a more recent one is bringing Scottie Pippen into the Web3 space. This was met with a really positive reception, and it has done quite well. Orange Comet, who we partnered Scottie with, had a really thoughtful and creative take on the project. Scottie got really excited about the space overall.  And also getting Jim Carrey into it. In addition to being a highly successful movie star, he's a painter and is genuinely passionate about his artwork. So we worked with him and partnered with SuperRare (a crypto art and NFT marketplace). I think it was a good example of bringing an artist into the space in the right way. He started by collecting first, as opposed to just putting out his own art. We feel really proud about that one.  You’ve signed such a wide range of Web3 clients, from artists to developers to founders. I can see how a visual artist makes sense – that feels like the kind creative talent that an agency typically signs. But I wouldn’t have guessed you’d be signing … developers?!  Yeah, so it's interesting. I think of people that fall into that category, or companies that fall into that category, as essentially producers.  When I look at new technologies, I describe them to our [traditional] clients as opportunities to tell stories. In this area, there is a bit of a technical barrier. So if you look at something like generative art, for example, there's a coding aspect to it. Yes, you need to make a visual design and something aesthetically pleasing. But there’s also a coding component to creating the generative output. Or, in the example I shared about Transient Labs, bringing a technical dynamic aspect to an art project is often not something that the visual artist inherently knows how to do. Or an athlete or music artist, for that matter.  So it’s just working backwards off a potential creative concept, and realizing that there are actually some partners – or producers, if you will – that happen to have a much more technical background. It was an early observation that we made. Because when I zoom out and I talk about Web3, I'm including gaming and the metaverse and AI and a lot of these technologies. So it’s understanding how to build in these different environments and across these different platforms. There’s real value in understanding the developer ecosystem that exists around it, and identifying ways to either represent those companies, like Transient, or where we've got some referral-oriented relationships and can create some sort of a strategic partnership.  What advice would you give Web3 creators who are hoping to get signed by an agent? What are you looking for?  What we look for is unique storytelling. And unique is the operative word here, because there are a lot of projects that seem to copy other projects.  So we’re looking for both creative uniqueness and also strategic uniqueness. What our client Gmoney has been doing with his 9dcc apparel collection – this is highly unique, super innovative and really thoughtful around the community. And if I wasn't representing him and I saw what he was doing, he would absolutely be an obvious target for us to go after.  How has your work with Web3 been impacted by crypto winter? And how have you handled it?  There are a couple things that I tend to say. One is, we've obviously seen a global [challenge] in broader financial markets, with equities and with inflation and rising interest rates. And economic downturns are just cyclical. We'll have the downturn, then there'll be a recovery period. I can't predict how long that will be, but I take comfort in the fact that this is just part of a series of different macroeconomic cycles. And I think that's largely what's affecting this space.  And the second thing you say?  I think it's safe to say that there's no systemic issue that underpins blockchain technology to its detriment.  What do you mean exactly?  What happened at FTX is different than what happened with Luna. And to some extent, it's different than what happened at 3AC. Yet all these things add to the clickbaity headline of “crypto's in the toilet, and there's no business to be done here.”  And in some ways, what [crypto winter] has done to the benefit of this community is to really shine a light on who's here to stay. Which companies are well-funded, well -run, have strong entrepreneurship inside of them and are still interested in doing partnership deals with our clients? It's really important to play this for the long haul. This is not a one-and-done transaction that we're talking about.  This is about making a commitment into this category. I think the statement is overused, but this is the time to build. And if you look at the number of tech unicorns, the majority of them were built in a bear market. I take a lot of comfort in that. It's why I've personally invested into the space and collect in the space, and am really spending an inordinate amount of my career in this area. I'm not naive to the crypto winter, but I'm also not concerned to where I've exited stage left.  That’s two of us!

State Street will continue to work on “a multi-faceted solution for both tokenized securities as well as native tokens,” the bank said, adding that the “regulatory environment for digital assets has continued to evolve, as has the requirements for servicing this asset class.”  The latest wave of uncertainty to grip the crypto industry has seen several of its dedicated banking partners collapse or step back from crypto firms. Adding to this trend, Copper announced somewhat out of the blue Thursday that it was closing down its enterprise infrastructure business to connect banks and hedge funds with digital assets. It will instead focus on its Clear Loop custody and settlement business.  Copper’s association with State Street, one of the largest custody banks in the world, was seen as a major coup for the London-based crypto firm, whose chairman is former U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond.

42421072,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRaf,1678988626,"Taking Photos and Minting NFTs at the Ends of the Earth, With FOTO’s John Knopf","Good photography often requires as much technical skill as artistic sensibility, making it uniquely fit for experimentation in Web3. Yet, talk to any non-fungible token (NFT) collector or creator and they’ll say it took a while for “photography NFTs” to take off.  John Knopf, an Emmy Award-nominated landscape photographer who works for National Geographic, was an early adopter. While he came into crypto during the heady days of the NFT bull market thinking he could make a “quick buck,” he said, he quickly became enthralled with the potential of distributed networks.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Culture Week.""  “Web3 is all about elevating one another and working to advance the art form,” Knopf said. Together with seven other prominent photographers – Alejandro Cartagena, Ben Strauss, Cath Simard, Dave Krugman, Isaac “Drift” Wright, J.N. Silva and Ravi Vora – Knopf helped found FOTO, a collective geared at training artists to work in Web3.  FOTO boasts hundreds of members of amateur and professional artists today. Knopf curates members’ art to exhibit at sponsored galleries and events. The idea is to elevate digital art, Knopf said, adding he makes “no money from the artists whether their work sells or not.” In 2021, Time magazine partnered with FOTO on its own NFT drops. Knopf’s work has also been featured by Red Bull, USA Today, Billboard Magazine and Google.  See also: Better Policy Can Turn NFTs Into an Intellectual Property Powerhouse  A self-taught photographer, psychonaut and fun-loving guy, Knopf will be speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus this year in Austin, Texas. We reached out to him ahead of the event to hear his thoughts on the NFT bear market, pricing artwork and the early days of the Bored Ape community. The conversation has been lightly edited.  What do you think has changed most about the crypto conference circus during the bear market?  I've spoken at Art Basel along with NFT NYC and will be speaking at the upcoming NFC Summit in Portugal. To be honest, things have become more cutthroat, especially considering the trading aspects of everything; a lot has changed. Conferences had better vibes and art. Now it's more focused on trading.  Cutthroat is kind of an interesting phrase. Is that how you’d describe the NFT market now?  Yeah, I mean, when liquidity dries up and there’s blood in the water, everyone's just kind of at each other trying to get what they can while they still can.  Speaking of – let’s call it – luck, isn’t there a story about you selling a BAYC NFT and profiting over $1 million?  Yeah, it's an insane story. You have like 10 minutes?  If you do.  So when I first got into Bored Apes, I minted 13 originally one night when they first came out, and I got one with a spaceship, pipe and laser eyes, and I held onto him because I really wanted a lot of money because I knew it was rare and I liked it a lot.  One night I was at a furniture store with my wife and I got $1 million transferred to my Ledger out of nowhere and an email that said, I just sent you 230 ETH [ether] by accident. I immediately called Keith Grossman [former Time president, now at Moonpay] and said, “Someone just sent me a million dollars. What do I do?” And he said, “Don't respond to them. We'll contact your attorney. We'll figure it out on Monday,” because it was a weekend.  I figured, it's Web3. I'm gonna hit this guy up at 1 a.m. and see exactly why this guy did what he did. I found him on Twitter, and DMed him and I said, “Hey, man, you just sent me a million dollars, like, what's going on?” And he responds: “I wanted to buy your Space Ape, and made you an offer. Since you didn't accept it, I meant to retract the bid and send the ETH back to myself but had your ETH address copied and accidentally pasted that instead of my own.”  Apparently, Deepak, the buyer was doing these transactions on his phone, which sort of explains the mistake.  We both laughed, and I said, “That's probably the dumbest mistake I've ever heard of. But you know, I'm gonna send it back to you, obviously, I just wanted to confirm this wasn't a wash trade.” It seemed shady. So I said, “It looks like you want my Space Ape so why don't we work out a deal, what do you want for it?” And he said, ""230 ETH, my original offer."" I responded, basically, ""I need life-changing money for him.”  See also: Why NFT Artists Shouldn't Expect 'Royalties' | Opinion  So we agreed on 347 ETH, which was $1.420 million, for the culture. He then proceeded to make me an offer for 347 ETH on OpenSea, which I accepted, and then returned his original 230 ETH I still had in my wallet. A month later he returned and bought both the Space Ape's mutants derivatives for 230 ETH.""  It's hard to imagine someone so flush with cash to send $1 million on spec.  It's one of those moments in crypto history. We ultimately agreed on a $1.42 million sale price, and then he bought [Bored Ape] Mutants for another million dollars so the total sale ended up being around $2.5 million.  Are you still involved in the Bored Ape scene?  No, not really. I mean, originally I kind of helped them in the market in the beginning – going back to the time when everyone was on Clubhouse. Me and Farokh [a popular Web3 podcaster and Knopf’s co-founder for Rug Radio] would talk about the Apes and, you know, brigade different rooms. That’s kind of how the market started with Apes – we would raid rooms and show off our NFTs. Gary Vee didn’t know about them – nobody knew about them – before we raided their rooms on Clubhouse, and they would be like, what are these stupid Apes?  Are you at all surprised with how successful BAYC has become? Yuga Labs is probably the most important company in NFTs today.  It’s funny, I remember when you couldn't even trade an Ape for a Punk [editor’s note: short for CryptoPunk, the first NFT series created in 2017, which became highly desirable digital assets as the NFT bubble crested]. Six months into it, I remember the Punk community saying, “Well, I guess Apes could be a community but they gotta kind of work on it.” Like they were laughing at us.  So to see the collabs now – and when Yuga bought out the entire Punk IP – it was pretty incredible to watch.  Yeah. Who knew ape cartoons could be so valuable? Could still be so valuable.  Yeah, they're killing it. Not to denigrate – the agents are killing – but luck was a major factor in their situation.  Have these digital communities, NFT communities changed?  Originally I think it was all about, like, the art and the good vibes and everything. I think now that we're in a bear market, liquidity has dried up so everyone's going at each other and attacking each other. It’s a little scary out there, a little toxic. But that happens with any community. Like, I grew up in the Rave scene – it was a similar situation where it started off as this whole Respect, Unity, Love thing. We're in this interim moment, figuring out where we're going to end up.  I also created a Web3 photo community. I love those people. Everybody involved in our photo community is just incredible. It really goes to show what this technology can offer. I grew up as a photographer not really knowing a lot of other photographers out there. And then the Instagram photography community was just competitive – everyone scrambling for likes. Web3 is all about elevating one another and working to advance the art form.  What are the guiding principles of FOTO?  The idea is, it’s a mix of artists – some well-known, a bunch who are completely unknown – who are all peers, all equal within our community. We all work together. We all pitch in and try to create events. We do galleries.  Photography always seemed like such a perfect blend between artistic sensibility and technology. It makes sense for photographers to find their way to crypto.  Funny story: Also, like, two years ago during the [COVID-19] pandemic, my friends and I were on Clubhouse trolling people. We'd make Flat Earth rooms, Scientology rooms, stuff like that. One night I stumble into an NFT photography room with five or 10 photographers in there, basically debating whether or not photography would even work on the blockchain. People were convinced that an NFT would have to be 3D art or we’d have to animate our photography. It hit me – I can't animate my photography; I'm good at what I do, but I can’t do that – that this was an opportunity to dive in while everyone else was holding back. I was just going to do what I‘ve always done, taking photos and setting prices I believe they’re worth.  I've always been curious about how photographers price their work. The material inputs – camera and equipment – are expensive but the art objects are infinitely scalable.  I'll give you an example: My first trip to Hawaii early in my career, like 12 years ago. I paid for the trip myself. It cost me around $15,000 – a lot of money for me back then. I was basically camping on the beach to eat and survive, but I stayed there for months and it cost me a fortune to be able to do that. So there’s the cameras, the equipment and paying for an experience worth documenting. And I take my time into account. But mostly what I look at when I price my work is not necessarily what goes into it but the expertise of being a craftsman. The costs are all mixed into one price point but I always think whether I would regret the sale 10 years down the line.  I underpriced some of my best work that I can't reshoot. I went back to Hawaii about a month ago and found that about 60% of my shots 10 years ago could not be reshot today – like, the rainbow eucalyptus trees have been destroyed and the vantage points for a lot of shots were gone. So it's not just about the time that you put into it but the fact that you're capturing a moment in history that will never ever be captured again. So you have to price your work accordingly.  With NFTs, it's different from traditional art or traditional photography. You do editions, you rarely do one-of-ones. Famous photographers can sell a single shot for millions of dollars because it's a one-of-one and they can't sell 500 editions to make their entire budget back. I'm not used to doing a one-of-one sale, so when I'm pricing my art it's like I have to remember that in 10 years from now I don't want to regret what I'm doing now.  Heavy. Do you think you might come to regret crypto?  When I first entered the NFT scene I thought it’d be a great cash grab to make some money really fast while it was going because no one knew how long it would last. After about two weeks of sitting with the community, talking to people, I realized I had a much larger place here because of my background. You know, I had two galleries that I opened myself because galleries wouldn't take my art – I literally lived out of my car to open my first gallery. So my conviction in my art is a lot higher. When I finally understood the technology behind crypto, what the blockchain will do for the future, especially future generations of artists, I went in full speed.  I have a very long-term vision. You know, as artists we've been sold the idea that exposure is going to pay our bills. We've been told, if this was in your portfolio you'll get that bigger job. And so on. It’s always been exposure, exposure, exposure – very rarely are we valued. Web3 is a place where we can set the market for ourselves, for future generations.  Do you think NFTs has made an indent on the traditional art scene?  It’s huge right now! We're seeing kids come into the space like Nyla Hayes, a 12-year-old artist who made $8 million for her family [Knopf helped advise her “Long Neckies” project]. Richard Zheng is a 15-year-old photographer who has made enough ETH to pay his mom’s mortgage. He’s one of my employees for the FOTO galleries; he designs all the templates. So it's an opportunity for not just adults but really anyone. If I had this opportunity as a teen I don’t want to know how much further along my career would be. The community and the culture is what's proving stronger than the monetary value.  See also: The Art World Underestimates the Power of NFTs | Opinion  I like to compare the early internet community to crypto. Do you have an “aha moment” of being online?  I've been online since probably 1995. I was like an early user of Prodigy [a computer program that predates the World Wide Web]. But actually, my aha moment about tech was when crypto came out. In 2011, when I won my first StarCraft competition, I was paid in bitcoin and was able to go to the Silk Road and buy something and realized, wow, this is a really cool opportunity for us. It was the first time I bought acid.  That stuff seems to be popular in tech. Do you do a lot of psychedelics?  Another funny story: I hadn't done psychedelics in a decade but the night I minted Bored Apes, the only reason I minted them was because I was on mushrooms and, well – I thought it was the stupidest art I'd ever seen. I love art. This is not art. But on mushrooms, I was like, these are insane! I used my wedding money – my wife almost left me.  I can keep this out of the piece if you prefer. It is funny.  It's hilarious. I tell the story all the time.  Any closing thoughts?  I have to say something about the photography community – the reason why photography has become more and more dominant in the Web3 art scene is because there’s a community that has rallied behind it. I compare it to the 3D and animated art communities. You look at any of the other communities and there's just not the same cultural force. With crypto it feels like we all rise together.

42421326,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqeL,1678987990,The Banking Crisis Has Been Good for Stablecoin Experimentation,"Who would have thought the U.S. government would be bailing out stablecoins? Well, through sheer coincidence, this week when the U.S. Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and FDIC announced plans to backstop all deposits at two failed banks, they were also pledging to secure at least 8% of the collateral for the USDC stablecoin. Circle, the stablecoin’s issuer, said it keeps around a quarter of USDC’s reserve assets at about six banks. What are the odds?  The bailout benefited Circle, which was working overtime last weekend while USDC depegged from the U.S. dollar. In a recent ""Bankless"" episode Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire spoke about the emergency measures his company took, as well as the serious game theorizing Circle has played over the past two years to spread out its cash and one day essentially turn stablecoins into “straight-through government obligation money.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  If you balk at the idea of a crypto-based tool like stablecoins essentially functioning like a “proxy” central bank digital currency (CBDC), as host Ryan Sean Adams suggested, making Allaire smile, then you’re likely not alone. Stablecoins may be the bridge between crypto and the real economy, but they should also retain some of the aspects that make crypto crypto, beyond 24-hour access and a different transaction settlement mechanism. Censorship resistance is all but impossible if crypto nuzzles close to the banking system.  Read more: Anna Baydakova – Why Stablecoin USDC’s Unstable Weekend Matters  But why be so prescriptive? “Stablecoin” is an imperfect word to describe a whole host of blockchain-based assets that can have a range of attributes and completely different mechanics. Apart from the promise to have a sticky price, there is little USDC has in common with terraUSD, the stablecoin whose algorithm failed.  In fact, in the wake of the recent banking crisis, there’s been a flutter of stablecoin experimentation. Just today, a Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Sovryn introduced the Sovryn dollar (DLLR) backed entirely by BTC. There have been similar experiments with stablecoins backed with gold.  Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, recently plugged the idea of nakacoin, a stablecoin that would be issued by member crypto exchanges that list the inverse bitcoin perpetual swaps that would back the asset.  I can’t vouch for any of the soundness of the ideas behind these projects, but I can say, generally, experimentation is good. USDC showed the world this weekend that the idea of issuing a dollar proxy backed by safe investments and cash stored at banks can be resilient even when a critical component fails. Tether, the company with a checkered past that issues thje USDT stablecoin, has not only grown despite being caught lying by New York State prosecutors but is thriving.  But crypto is also supposed to offer alternatives to banks and finance. There are doubtless people who would prefer to take on “protocol risk” of an all-on-chain stablecoin rather than the “platform risk” of a stablecoin with a bank account. But there I go again, being prescriptive.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | USDT | USDC,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/16/the-banking-crisis-has-been-good-for-stablecoin-experimentation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a95ca21c7d01a59993d2008992716cbc1158482-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412621,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5Sba,1678985703,Investors Flock to Tokenized Diamond as Crypto Banking Crisis Props Hard Assets,"The collapse of three prominent U.S. banks over the weekend led to market volatility and a lot of uncertainties as to where investors could stash their cash. Gold, the age-old safe haven, saw a boost in prices by about 5% since last week, and another asset that caught investors' attention was diamond – digitized diamond.  Diamond Standard, a blockchain company that tokenized and standardized the diamond market to allow investors buy the previously hard-to-invest-in gemstone, said it saw a large spike in its marketplace after the banks started to shut down.  During periods of market uncertainty investors often flee to hard assets, such as cash, commodities and real estate to protect investments from volatility.  “[Sales] of diamond coins and other products increased substantially since Friday on the back of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank being shut down by regulators, USDC breaking its [dollar] peg and amid fears of contagion spreading to other banks and to digital assets,” said Cormac Kinney, founder and CEO of Diamond Standard.  The company gathers physical diamonds together in a ""coin"" of standardized value that's stored in a vault. Each holds eight to nine diamonds. The diamond-embedded tokens are digitized through an Ethereum-based digital coin, bitcarbon, which is tradable on different exchanges.  Trading volume of the tokenized diamond jumped almost 300% during the weekend as investors scrambled to find a haven, said Kinney. Most of the clients who wanted to buy tokenized diamonds wanted to get out of stablecoins, he said.  Read more: Circle Scrambles to Right USDC After Signature Bank Failure  Most of the clients that bought into Diamond Standard’s coins were long-only, meaning they wanted to buy and hold the asset to diversify their portfolios while participating in the upside, Kinney said.  “Our investors, who very often have gold in their portfolios, sees diamonds as something that is uncorrelated to other assets,” providing them an opportunity for diversification and hedging, he said. Kinney noted that the price of diamonds is still playing catch-up with other precious metals, opening doors for investors to participate in the appreciation.  Most of the buyers are existing customers, which include individuals, family offices and some smaller hedge funds, Kinney noted. During the chaotic weekend, Diamond Standard Spot Market, a peer-to-peer marketplace with a centralized limit order book, remained open 24/7 and handled a jump in volumes, the company said.  Read more: Blockchain Startup Aims to Open the $1T Diamond Market to More Investors  Kinney, a software entrepreneur and developer of market heat maps, started Diamond Standard in 2018 with a goal to open up the $1.2 trillion diamond market to a wider group of investors.  The firm's patented technology is designed to create a more transparent system allowing investors to track supply chains and subsequent ownership of the world’s ultimate bling more easily and efficiently. The company also standardized the value of diamonds by creating a uniform system through blockchain technology.  Kinney said his company primarily banks with Signature Bank, though it has relationships with other banks. While the weekend’s events had been worrisome at the time, he says the company is still using Signature Bridge Bank – a new interim entity that will be temporarily run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) – which has transferred all of the deposits and majority of the assets of former Signature Bank.  “We are using Signature Bridge Bank.

The token will provide decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance rights for the Arbitrum network.  Currently, ARB is the sixth-most trending Twitter topic in the United States with more than 10,000 tweets. Arbitrum posted a 93-second short movie that ends with Ed Felten, co-founder of Offchain Labs, saying, “Let’s build Arbitrum together. 3.23.” The tweet has 1.4 million views.  Offchain Labs is a New York-based company that develops Arbitrum, a dominant leading layer 2 rollup and fourth-largest blockchain by total value locked.  Arbitrum moves one step forward in its decentralization efforts by issuing its ARB token which “enables community-driven DAO governance,” as stated in a blog post.  When asked “why now?” in a Twitter space, Arbitrum co-founder and CEO of Offchain Labs Steven Goldfeder said, “Giving over permissions to the community to build on the chain and to license other [layer 2s] – to put that in the hands of the community, there has to be a community first. There has to be a DAO, and this is the natural time to do that and to really empower the community in that way.”  Contrasting emotions in Arbitrum’s Discord channel  The Arbitrum Discord has been rife in activity. Since the announcement, users have sent thousands of messages in the general chat that highlight a full spectrum of human emotion.  Several are frustrated by virtue of being ineligible for the airdrop despite claiming they qualify; others are thankful for “free money,” while many are asking for help with the airdrop, asking questions on the February snapshot and what the circulating supply of ARB will be at launch.  Moreover, messages speculating about the potential price level of the ARB token have also been abundant.",POSITIVE,ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | ARB | AIRDROP,Sage D.

The news was later confirmed in a post from the company.  The reasoning was that focusing on Copper’s Clear Loop custody and settlement business made more economic sense going forward.  Copper's enterprise division was focused on securing digital asset custody and infrastructure solutions for banks and funds. There will be some job losses on Copper's enterprise business, but it's too early to say how many people will be affected, according to the source.  ""Given the present challenging conditions in the digital assets space, an uncertain US regulatory environment and a desire to focus on strategic offerings, Copper is streamlining its business, and as a result has announced a redundancy process,"" Copper said in a statement.  Copper was alerted to a security issue in December of last year involving the company’s GitHub repository, which contains a blueprint for how the firm secures customers’ assets.

42411041,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB4Ur,1678980207,How AI Is Changing Artistic Creation and Challenging IP Laws,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining notoriety among traditional and Web3 artists alike. While some creatives worry that AI will one day replace their jobs or steal their work, other artists have welcomed the technical experimentation and have even found ways to use bots to execute their artistic vision.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Culture Week.  But questions about the moral implications of AI have left artists divided, and concerns about plagiarism to data privacy have been raised. Some artistic communities have gone so far as to ban AI-generated images created using tools such as DALL-E, Midjourney and StarryAI from being shared.  Meanwhile, the artists who embrace AI speak passionately about their work and are eager to provide insight into the expansive technology. Some artists view their relationship with AI bots in a similar fashion to a parent teaching their child how to read, write or draw. “I did lots of drawing with my kids when they were little,” said Australian artist Lilyillo on Twitter Spaces in February. “I was watching his brain actually learn in real-time … I feel the same wonder when watching these [AI] tools.”  Artists who work closely with AI are helping those of us outside the field understand it through their craft and experimentation. Along with researchers, authors and technologists developing AI tools, the world of AI art illuminates some pressing questions regarding intellectual property (IP) and ownership in Web3.  Intellectual property and originality  Artificial intelligence is creating a new artistic canon, says AI researcher and poet Sasha Stiles, who has been a poetry mentor to Hanson Robotics’ humanoid robot BINA48 since 2018.  Language models such as the AI chatbot ChatGPT and similar tools like Sudowrite create neural computer networks that absorb vast quantities of text and other data on the internet, then process it through an algorithm to form comprehensible statements.  The human-led process of developing language models creates what Stiles describes as a “pool of data” which users can collectively draw upon from things like books, films, encyclopedias and ideas found inside a physical or digital library.  “As a writer I think there is this romantic stereotype of the solitary writer, toiling away in the empty room, and that the ideas we're coming up with spring out of thin air,” said Stiles. Yet, in reality, artists have always been inspired by and have drawn inspiration from existing cultural works, she said.  “How many ideas inform the things I'm doing as a poet?” Stiles asks, noting the similarities between how humans and AI gather information to create new things.  As for plagiarism and concerns about originality, Stiles said some writers and artists are looking into ways to opt out of having their text included in language model data sets. But at this time there is no clear avenue to protecting one’s published words from AI crawlers, or tools used to scrape data from online sources.  These challenges tend to be more fraught in the context of text-to-image art generators such as DALL-E or Midjourney, which have the capability to create images from text prompts in the style of a particular artist – sometimes without that artist’s knowledge or permission.  For instance, a New Yorker staff writer generated an image of a Havanese dog in the style of the late Harper’s Bazaar photographer Richard Avedon using DALL-E 2. This ability has incited accusations that AI tools trivialize plagiarism and make it too easy to violate intellectual property protections.  The challenges of applying existing IP laws to AI works  Many of these ideas and technologies are still emerging, and therefore fall under several legal gray areas, said Jessica Neer McDonald, a Florida-based trademark and copyright lawyer at Neer McD PLLC.  “The question here is to try to figure out where the copyright ownership begins,” she said. The first consideration is input – who actually owns the unique combination of prompts, text and data used to generate a signature style, and what effect does that ownership have on the output generated?  These boundaries will likely be worked out through court cases and statute interpretation that funnel through the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  “These are ethical concerns that, as a society, we're really confronted with for the first time,” said McDonald.  Another consideration is intent. Is the artist purposefully using a protected logo, slogan or design for monetary gain or promotional purposes? It’s not yet clear how blatant one is allowed to be in their description or how closely an output may resemble a protected image without legal implications. There are few existing parameters when it comes to AI-generated works, and some AI tools have limits in place for how closely they can mimic protected symbols, characters and texts.  While there isn’t yet precedent for these questions surrounding AI and intellectual property, USCO and USPTO have generally upheld the precedent that AI-generated artwork is generally not protected under IP law.  “Intellectual property law has historically focused on protecting the fruit of human intellect,” said McDonald, citing an August 2022 case in which the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia affirmed that only a “natural person” can be considered an inventor. In another recent instance, USCO rescinded a copyright registration granted to AI artist Kristina Kashtanova for her graphic novel because the artist failed to disclose that the images in the book were generated with the help of Midjourney. After careful review, the office granted protection only for the text and compilation of the book but not for the images because they were “not the product of human authorship.”  An updated set of guidelines on the ""Human Authorship"" requirement published on March 16, 2023, by the USCO was lauded by AI artist Silver as a ""vital win,"" noting that the text calls out exceptions that may qualify AI-generated work as ""original.""  In her tweet, Silver cited a passage in the new guidelines that said ""a work containing AI-generated material will also contain sufficient human authorship to support a copyright claim. For example, a human may select or arrange AI-generated material in a sufficiently creative way that ‘‘the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.’’  Regardless, AI mimicry poses multiple concerns, even though AI-generated art is not protected by IP law. Even fan-generated artwork with no obvious monetary incentives may, as digital artist Greg Rutkowski says, conflate the artist’s authentic works with computer-generated images. Rutkowski, who is famous for illustrating fantasy landscapes in games like Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has complained the internet is too overcrowded with AI artwork resembling his own for his original work to receive attention anymore.  “There are many lawsuits where an artist's style may try to be protected under copyright law, and those are decided on a case-by-case basis,” said McDonald.  While style is not something that can always be copyrighted, the larger question being posed is whether the ability to create artwork easier through an AI tool interferes with an original artist’s exclusivity provided under copyright law.  Artists who are interested in releasing AI-generated artworks and books — such as Stephen Thaler’s AI-generated picture, ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise,"" Claire Silver’s selected works or this entire sci-fi magazine — should look at the terms and conditions of each AI machine used, noting specifically what kind of intellectual property rights you or the company may be granted to the work generated between human and bot.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/03/16/how-ai-is-changing-artistic-creation-and-challenging-ip-laws,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43a6b923957db97c7b3fafe9461ae87a417d3e07-6240x3510.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387872,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQw1Ib,1678976266,Ethereum’s Shanghai Hard Fork Now Has Official Target Date,"Ethereum developers set a target date of April 12 for its long-awaited Shanghai hard fork during the All Core Developers Execution Layer #157 call Thursday.  The Shanghai upgrade, more accurately called ""Shapella,"" marks the completion of Ethereum’s full transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network, and will enable staked ETH withdrawals.  Once the date is voted on by developers and confirmed via GitHub, slot 6209536, occurring on or around April 12, will be set in stone for the Shanghai upgrade. This means that Shanghai will be slightly delayed from the developers initial target for this month.  Read more: Shanghai + Capella = 'Shapella': How Ethereum Devs Now Refer to Upcoming Upgrade  When Ethereum switched to a PoS consensus mechanism in September in an event known as the Merge, the network began using validators instead of miners. Validators had to stake 32 ETH in order to approve or add blocks to the blockchain.  Before validators joined Ethereum’s PoS blockchain, they were made aware that their staked ETH and any rewards would remain locked up until Shanghai. Some validators have had their funds locked up since December 2020, when Ethereum’s PoS Beacon Chain went live.  Now, those validators will be able to decide after April 12 what they want to do with their stake.  Since the Merge, Ethereum developers have run numerous tests in order to ensure that staked ETH withdrawals would function properly. All three tests on Ethereum’s testnets ran smoothly, though the last testnet hard fork on Goerli experienced low participation rates because validator nodes didn't upgrade in time.  While staked ETH withdrawals were able to be processed on the testnet, blocks weren't completed until about 90 minutes after the fork went live.  Ben Edgington, product lead of Teku, an Ethereum client, told CoinDesk that “despite the reduced participation, we could see that all client types were producing valid blocks, and that participation increased over time. This reassured us that nothing was fundamentally wrong, just late upgraders.”  Edgington added that “losing finality for 90 minutes is inconvenient, but not critical for most applications or users of Ethereum.”  Ethereum developers aren't worried that this will happen on the mainnet too. “It's quite typical for testnet upgrades to be a little bumpy, but people are very diligent about maintaining their mainnet staking infrastructure,” Edgington said.

The collection, based on Whale’s popular black and white doodles, will include 3,500 creatures, colorized and animated by Orange Comet. The collection will be for sale as a primary drop on non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea in April.  Whale told CoinDesk he’s enthusiastic about bringing new life to his work through NFTs. The teen has already partnered with Nike and Disney and has fans including Prince William and his wife. He’s now ready to take his career as an artist to the next level by tapping into digital collectibles and further expanding his fanbase.  “I’ve only ever drawn with a black marker and a blank sheet of canvas, but I’ve always imagined my art coming to life in other formats in my head,” Whale said.  “There's so many things you can do [with NFTs], and with my characters I imagine them in my head coming to life, just being able to see that I think it's really important,” Whale told CoinDesk. “Being able to interact and look at the storylines and things and really get into the characters is one way that it will help my community.”  While the mint begins April 25, the collection will evolve throughout the week of its release. Users who buy the NFT will start with Whale’s original doodle, which days later will turn into a clay rendering that will then become the final, digitized 3D model of the token.  “The reason we want to do that is because we have to pay homage to how this collection started. And it's all with Joe and a doodle,” Dave Broome, CEO of Orange Comet, told CoinDesk.  Orange Comet has had success in its celebrity NFT partnerships in the past, including actor Sir Anthony Hopkins’ collection in October (which broke OpenSea records by selling out in under seven minutes, as well as NBA champion Scottie Pippen’s virtual sneaker drop in December. In February, Orange Comet raised $7 million in equity, and expects a larger funding round later this year.  Interested in keeping up with Web3 news and trends?

42387881,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQw1u1,1678971600,Arbitrum to Airdrop New Token and Transition to DAO,"Arbitrum, the biggest player in Ethereum’s layer 2 scaling landscape, is finally getting a token.  The Arbitrum Foundation said on Thursday that ARB, Arbritrum’s new token, will be airdropped to community members on Thursday, March 23.  According to the Arbitrum Foundation, ARB will mark Arbitrum’s official transition into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning ARB holders will be able to vote on key decisions governing Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova – networks that allow users to transact on the Ethereum blockchain with greater speeds and lower fees.  “Arbitrum DAO will have the power to control key decisions at the core protocol level, from how the chain's technology is upgraded to how the revenue from the chain can be used to support the ecosystem,” the Arbitrum Foundation said in a statement.  Although the Arbitrum Foundation plans to grant a relatively high number of tokens to investors and core contributors (44%), Arbitrum’s creator – Offchain Labs – boasts that the ARB token will make the Arbitrum ecosystem more decentralized than alternative scaling chains.  “For me, the most exciting part is the decentralization – the fact that Offchain Labs will no longer have any control over the future of this chain,” Offchain Labs CEO Steven Goldfeder told CoinDesk. “We will be a service provider, and if the DAO calls on us to build software, we will.”  What is ARB?  Arbitrum worked with Nansen, the crypto analytics firm, to “snapshot” user activity in February in order to determine who should be eligible for ARB tokens. “How many transactions you did, how many different applications you used, and how long you've been using” Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nitro were among the factors used to determine eligibility, according to Goldfeder.  Arbitrum users will be able to check their eligibility for the airdrop and claim tokens by visiting gov.arbitrum.foundation. Users are encouraged to use caution while claiming their tokens; scammers frequently use the occasion of airdrops to phish people via spoof websites and other schemes.  ARB’s total circulation will number 10 billion. The Arbitrum community will control 56% of those tokens – the airdrop will grant 11.5% of the total supply to eligible Arbitrum users, and 1.1% to DAOs that operate in the Arbitrum ecosystem. The remaining community tokens will go to a treasury controlled by the new Arbitrum DAO, which will allow ARB holders to vote on how to disburse the funds.  The other 44% of ARB’s circulation will go to the investors and employees of Offchain Labs – the development firm that built Arbitrum. CEO Goldfeder says these tokens will be subject to lock-up periods and vesting schedules, though the proportion of ARB reserved for insiders is somewhat high in comparison to similar projects (Optimism, Arbitrum’s main competitor, rewarded 36% of its OP tokens to investors and core contributors, for example).  Unlike ether (ETH), which is used to pay out fees on Ethereum (and Arbitrum), the ARB token will only be used for protocol governance. Arbitrum DAO’s governance process will be self-executing, meaning votes can be used to directly alter Arbitrum’s core code.  Code changes will be subject to a time delay (to leave time for audits and other safety considerations), but a 12-person security council governed by the Arbitrum DAO will have the ability to make quicker bug fixes.  ARB’s introduction has been timed to coincide with the launch of Arbitrum Obit, which will allow third-party apps and protocols to build new “layer 3” blockchains based atop Arbitrum’s low-fee infrastructure.  Why now?  Arbitrum has $3.69 billion locked into its Ethereum rollup network, Aribtrum One, making it the clear market leader in a cut-throat field of competing chains. According to L2 Beat, a layer 2 analytics site, Arbitrum holds 55% of the Ethereum Layer 2 market share.  As one of the largest crypto projects without a token, anticipation for an Arbitrum token has been at a fever pitch since the network went live in 2021.  Read more: Arbitrum Surges Ahead as Ethereum’s Layer 2 Landscape Takes Shape  Arbitrum’s main competitor in the Ethereum scaling space, Optimism, launched its OP token nearly a year ago when it made its own transition to DAO governance.  Both Arbitrum One and Optimism are so-called Optimistic rollup networks. They are blockchains that operate alongside Ethereum, bundle up big groups of transactions, and then write those transactions to the Ethereum ledger in bulk – slicing the fees that one would need to pay to execute those transactions individually.  As for why Arbitrum took longer to launch its governance token, Goldfeder said, “The tech came first. And based on our technical road map, now was the right time.” According to Goldfeder, Arbitrum has reached certain technical milestones, such as working fraud proofs (the technology underpinning Arbitrum One’s security) that its main competitor has yet to achieve.",POSITIVE,ETH | ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | ARB | AIRDROP,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/16/arbitrum-to-airdrop-new-token-and-transition-to-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba3c6f4d3643cd3fd133ae77a540c40e17f13edc-1980x1021.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421328,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnqgP,1678970700,Stop Blaming Crypto for Traditional Finance Failures,"Recent news has been dominated by the collapse of several banks, including Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate and Signature Bank – all of which provided vital services to the crypto industry by bridging the gap between blockchain technology and traditional finance.  However, some media outlets are quick to blame the crypto industry for these financial disasters. Is this fair, or are traditional financial institutions failing us again? Many crypto advocates argue that blockchain technology offers a solution to the issues plaguing traditional finance and it isn’t the problem.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  What happened to Silicon Valley Bank?  Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest bank globally with $210 billion in deposits, recently experienced a devastating collapse that impacted the global financial system. As a leading provider of banking services to nearly half of the United States' venture capital-backed technology and life-science companies and over 2,500 venture capital firms, the bank's downfall had a significant effect on the technology and financial sectors.  The collapse can be traced back to the bank's investment strategy, which involved placing a substantial portion of its funds into Treasurys. As interest rates rose, the value of lower-yielding Treasury bonds declined, with new issues offering higher interest rates entering the market. Holding these bonds to maturity would usually have mitigated the impact of interest rate fluctuations. However, the situation worsened when depositors began withdrawing their funds en masse.  On March 8, Silicon Valley Bank publicly revealed its losses, leading to a massive sell-off of its stock on March 9. The bank attempted to raise $2 billion in capital to stabilize its financial position, but this move was met with skepticism, fueling further panic among depositors. A bank run ensued, forcing the bank to liquidate its Treasury holdings at a steep discount, exacerbating its losses.  Ultimately, the situation spiraled out of control, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had to step in to take over the bank. The FDIC's intervention is thought to be necessary to prevent further damage to the financial system and to protect depositors' funds.  How does the SVB collapse affect crypto?  There are a number of ways this situation affects the crypto industry negatively overall, including the following:  Loss of banking services: Crypto companies and startups that relied on Silicon Valley Bank's services now face operational disruptions and financial challenges as they scramble to find alternative banking partners.  Reserve instability and illiquidity: The collapse of SVB sent worries through the industry as the bank was revealed to have held reserves for the USDC stablecoin. Other crypto companies, including Ripple, also had announced exposure to the bank  Reduced investor confidence: The collapse has raised questions about the stability and sustainability of the crypto ecosystem, which may lead to decreased investments and slower growth in the sector.  Increased regulatory scrutiny: The failure of a major bank involved in the crypto industry is likely to prompt regulators to push for stricter regulations to protect investors and maintain financial stability.  Short-term price volatility: The collapse has caused temporary fluctuations in the prices of cryptocurrencies because panic selling and uncertainty around the implications of the collapse affect the broader industry.  Accelerate crypto adoption  Bank failures can expose the vulnerabilities of traditional centralized financial systems, prompting individuals and businesses to explore alternative solutions. The shortcomings of these systems, such as single points of failure, inefficiencies and the potential for mismanagement, can encourage more people to turn to decentralized financial systems like blockchain and cryptocurrencies, which offer increased security, transparency and autonomy.  As traditional financial institutions falter, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies can emerge as more reliable and secure alternatives, building trust among users. The transparency, immutability and consensus mechanisms in blockchain technology can foster a higher level of confidence in the data and transactions recorded on the network. In times of financial instability, individuals and businesses may also view cryptocurrencies, particularly those with limited supply and strong fundamentals, as a hedge against traditional financial risks, driving up demand and potentially accelerating adoption.  Read more: When Will Crypto Learn From the Mistakes of Banks?  Bank failures can also serve as a catalyst for innovation, creating demand for better financial solutions. Entrepreneurs and developers may seize this opportunity to create new blockchain-based financial products and services that address the shortcomings of traditional banking systems. This can include innovations in cross-border payments, lending and asset management.  Moreover, bank failures may disrupt cross-border transactions, making it more challenging for businesses to make payments or transfer funds internationally. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies can offer faster, cheaper and more secure cross-border transactions, making them an attractive alternative for businesses dealing with international partners.  Finally, the collapse of traditional financial institutions may prompt regulators to scrutinize financial systems more closely, potentially leading to clearer regulations and guidelines for blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Regulatory clarity can encourage more businesses and individuals to adopt these technologies, as they can better understand the risks and benefits involved.  Blockchain may actually be the solution  The situation with Silicon Valley Bank has exposed the vulnerabilities and shortcomings of traditional banking systems. However, blockchain technology holds the potential to revolutionize the financial sector by addressing these long-standing issues. Far from being the problem as pointed to in the media, blockchain emerges as a solution by providing a decentralized, secure and transparent financial system.  Read more: How U.S. Judges Might Save Crypto From the SEC  Its capacity to foster trust, prevent fraud and facilitate efficient transactions establishes it as a viable alternative to centralized banking. By capitalizing on blockchain's inherent strengths, the financial sector can surmount vulnerabilities, inefficiencies and mismanagement, ultimately paving the way for a more resilient, innovative and clean financial ecosystem.  As we learn from the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, it's crucial for the financial industry to adopt and embrace blockchain technology to prevent similar crises in the future. By leveraging the unique advantages of blockchain, we can create a more robust and reliable financial infrastructure that benefits businesses, individuals and the global economy as a whole.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,DJ Windle,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/16/stop-blaming-crypto-for-traditional-finance-failures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e76dd1595cc6969a402496f272ea508e4fa2857-2120x1192.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin funds are bleeding coins even as U.S. bank failures fuel expectations of an early Federal Reserve pivot in favor of liquidity easing. Usually, if the Fed doesn't raise rates aggressively like it has been doing, risky assets like bitcoin benefit, but the opposite is occurring with the bitcoin funds. Data tracked by ByteTree Asset Management shows the number of coins held by close-ended funds, spot and futures-focused exchange-traded funds in Europe, the U.S. and Canada has declined by 16,560 BTC ($409 million) this month, reaching a 17-month low of 826,113 BTC. ETFs and other investment vehicles that allow taking exposure to bitcoin without having to own the cryptocurrency are widely considered a proxy for institutional activity.  Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX transferred $2.2 billion to founder Sam Bankman-Fried through various entities, the firm's new management said. A total of $3.2 billion was paid to Bankman-Fried and other key employees, according to a financial report filed Wednesday. The next largest beneficiary after Bankman-Fried was Nishad Singh, FTX’s former director of engineering, who received about $587 million. In February, Singh pleaded guilty to charges including fraud and conspiracy for his role in FTX’s collapse. The payments were made predominantly from the Bankman-Fried-owned trading firm Alameda Research, whose precarious finances set the wheels in motion for FTX's collapse in November.  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler is doubling down on his opinion that proof-of-stake tokens could meet the definition of securities under the Howey Test, thus bringing them under his agency’s regulatory authority. Speaking to reporters after a commission vote on Wednesday, Gensler said securities laws could be triggered because investors anticipate a return when they purchase tokens underpinned by a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The Block first reported the news.  Chart of the Day  The chart by CryptoCompare shows that bitcoin's 1% market depth for BTC/USD pair or collection of buy and sell offers is within 1% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices.  The market depth tanked to fresh multi-month lows over the weekend after USDC lost its dollar peg, making it harder for traders to execute large orders at stable prices.  ""Coinbase’s BTC-USD liquidity (which is a unified market for USD and USDC on Coinbase) saw a sharp decline of its 1% market depth which was more severe than when FTX collapsed. 1% market depth fell from 846 BTC on the 10th to 417 BTC on the 11th, a 50.7% decline,"" CryptoCompare said in a report on Tuesday.  Deterioration in liquidity, as measured by market depth, means a few big orders can trigger outsized price moves in either direction.

Last week, stocks fell as regulators shut Silicon Valley Bank after investors withdrew their deposits en masse. The news hit crypto markets a day later when traders reacted to reports that USD coin (USDC) issuer Circle Internet Financial held over $3.3 billion in reserves at Silicon Valley. That led to USDC redemptions and to the price of the coin, which is supposed to be pegged to $1, falling to as low as 87 cents.  In a separate move, crypto-focused Signature Bank (SBNY) was shut by regulators over the weekend.  The collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank came shortly after Silvergate Bank, another banked that dealt mainly with crypto, imploded.  Signature is now on the market, but any potential buyer reportedly has to agree to a major caveat: no services to crypto companies, as CoinDesk reported.  But founders and developers of crypto firms remain focused on expanding the crypto universe, despite the scrutiny.  “In the near term, this (unbanking) could add to the increased regulatory scrutiny on crypto and the banking rails that serve crypto, and closer scrutiny of crypto’s contribution to systemic risk,” Ramani Ramachandran, co-founder and CEO of Router Protocol, said.  “It will also increase scrutiny on stablecoins such as USD tether, which were already under the spotlight even before the current USDC depeg,” he added.  Jonathan Zeppettini, head of international operations at cryptocurrency issuer Decred, said: ""The situation with Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature is a combination of a few things banks failing to properly hedge interest rate risk, a classic bank run stemming from that illiquidity as they are forced to realize losses if they do not hold those assets to maturity and opportunism by regulators to force the unwind of banks that are seen as 'crypto-friendly.'”  The “attempt to restrict liquidity” was the result of governments trying to strangle many of the weaker, relatively unregulated players and eventually set back adoption, he said.  Zeppettini, whose long-term outlook remains optimistic, said clampdowns could eventually create a more robust crypto economy.  “It may end up having the opposite effect as exchanges and other players in the industry move offshore to jurisdictions that are courting financial technology innovators, leading to more robust infrastructure and less hostility,” he said.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/16/crypto-observers-believe-us-banking-crisis-could-strengthen-crypto-ecosystem-in-the-long-term,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9a91fcf127fc9d93b3a1b9d85705f2a32a8ce4f-1296x729.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

XRP and Cardano's ADA dropped 4%, while shiba inu (SHIB) fell as much as 12% after drama surrounding the code of its forthcoming blockchain on Thursday morning.  BNB coin (BNB) gained after decentralized exchange Uniswap, which processes the highest daily trading volumes among counterparts, expanded to the network. The move is expected to offer several significant benefits for both the exchange and the network, including user growth, lower fees and the ability to tap into new geographical markets.  Analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex said indicators tracking wallet data show that while a long-term bullish trend remained intact, a shorter-term view describes the latter stages of a bear market.  ""Long-term indicators still indicate strength in the crypto market, and hence, the current pullback might be close to forming the higher low expected for the past three weeks,"" Bitfinex told CoinDesk in an email.  ""Bitcoin’s net realized profit and loss indicator suggests that the market has returned to a regime of significant realized losses. So it is important to remember that we are still in the latter stages of a bear market and not the beginning of a bull market,"" Bitfinex said.

It provides a reflection of aggregate market sentiment, capital inflows or outflows, and trends in network profitability.  ""It would be premature to state that the market has turned completely bullish. However, the current rise in net realized losses still pales in comparison to the peak seen during the luna crash or the FTX implosion.

Data tracked by ByteTree Asset Management shows the number of coins held by close-ended funds, spot and futures-focused exchange-traded funds (ETF) in Europe, the U.S. and Canada has declined by 16,560 BTC ($409 million) this month, reaching a 17-month low of 826,113 BTC.  ETFs and other investment vehicles that allow taking exposure to bitcoin without having to own the cryptocurrency are widely considered a proxy for institutional activity.  The decline in fund balance suggests a lack of institutional participation in bitcoin's recent rally, reportedly fueled by safe-haven demand and renewed hopes for Fed interest rate cuts in the second half of the year. According to some observers, the gains are evidence of bitcoin's strengthening appeal as a hedge against the banking system.  Bitcoin picked up a strong bid near $19,600 late Friday after Silicon Valley Bank, formerly one of the top 20 lenders in the U.S., shut operations. Bitcoin's price has risen over 25% since then, reaching a nine-month high of $26,501 on Tuesday, CoinDesk data shows.  ""Institutions aren’t buying the narrative that BTC is serious and here to stay,"" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, told CoinDesk. ""Wealth management industry globally is very light in both bitcoin and gold.""  Morris, however, cautioned against drawing conclusions from the data, saying a large outflow from a single fund is mainly responsible for dragging the tally lower.  Besides, the decline in the balance held in funds does not necessarily mean the price rally lacks strength and is unsustainable. Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said the balance held in funds accounts for a small portion of the total market and other sources of demand are lifting prices higher.

For the community around the SHIB token and Shibarium blockchain, it’s the difference between code that has been plagarized and open-source code that’s been recycled.  The drama began Thursday Asia time where an established member of its Discord pointed to the Shibarium chain using the same Chain ID number, 917, as the Rinia Testnet chain.  While Discord members were quick to generate their own explanations for the similarity, with some panic-selling the token, pushing it down 10%, the explanation from developers behind the Shibarium chain is something far more benign.  “Few chain IDs were picked randomly - 417(Alpha), 517(Staging), 917(pre-pod/beta) and these chains were not registered anywhere at that time, I made a mistake to not recheck when the puppynet network was launched,” tweeted Kaaldhairya, one of the pseudonymous developers.  Kaaldhairya tweeted that they were going to be “redeploying a new version of BETA network with a new chain ID.”  “Fresh deployments will be rare in the future but are possible because we will still be in BETA phase,” he continued.  Others pointed to similarities in code found on Github, a code repository.  Coders often re-use each others’ work for mundane and benign tasks. These pre-written blocks are known are libraries, and are available as open-source code. That is, code that’s intended to be copied and reused.  Andrew Angrisani, a member of the project’s Telegram community as well as its Discord, and a crypto security engineer, explained the code similarities to both Rinia and Shibarium using the same open-source code.  “Both Rinia TestNet and Shibarium copied open-source code for their block explorers called Blockscout and likely both were lazy in their implementation,” he said.  Another high-ranking community member, JesusM, called this all a “minor mistake made on beta.” JesusM said that this is the point of the beta process.  “Mistakes in it get tested and then fixed,” they said.  Angrisani speculated that part of this could be a ploy to drum up free marketing for Rinia and an upcoming project.  “The Rinia Testnet chain Dev is launching an [initial coin offering] for Firechain called a Shib Killer on March 31. They could be using this mud in the water to drum up free marketing since the ChainIDs were the same,” he said. “It may be an artifact of copying source code from an open-source project.”  This is also not the first time accusations have flown around. In February, questions on the Discord were being raised about similarities between Shibarium and Rinia.  “At the end of the day, Shibarium is likely still far off, Open Source code is being used (which is okay – other projects do it), Unification Fund is still working on Shibarium, and the Firechain/Rinia dev is using this to market their upcoming ICO,” Angrisani concluded.

The much-awaited Shibarium blockchain released its beta version for the layer 2 network last week, as CoinDesk reported. A beta testnet is a blockchain that mimics real-world functioning. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems (separate blockchains) built on top of layer 1 protocols that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data.  However, the euphoria surrounding the launch paused on Thursday morning after a top-ranked community member on Shiba Inu’s Discord channel flagged concerns. The concerns came from Shibarium beta testnet using the same Chain ID as an existing blockchain.  “Chain ID is the simplest thing any Blockchain dev looks for first when deploying a Blockchain,” community member Steve wrote. “As using an ID that already exists is just incompetent as your chain wouldn't work properly and everyone trying to interact with your chain would instead interact with the other chain.”  “Why is it that it looks like shibarium test net has taken rinia testnet genesis file. Changed the name from renia. But forgot to change the chain ID,” Steve added.  Developers and other prominent community members were quick to address the concerns. “There is absolutely no evidence that this is a fork of a chain that launched last month,” wrote one JesusM on the Discord channel. “Code is forked all the time. Moreover, there is no confirmation that it was.”  Discord user “Justinlime,” another network validator, chimed in: “Even if some of the code was used in the beta does not mean all of it was. To me it's very doubtful that it's a direct fork with nothing changed. Forking, and building upon already established software, is the core foundation of what FOSS (free and open source software) stands for.”  Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens BONE and LEASH were also down more than 10% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing.",NEGATIVE,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | SHIB | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/16/shiba-inu-token-falls-10-amid-shibarium-code-drama,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea4a7db7373043932c3fbc9bc3d2c19c85d98e71-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Click here for more.  Signature Bank is on the market after being shuttered by New York state regulators on Sunday, but any potential buyer reportedly has to agree to a major caveat: no crypto.  Reuters first reported the development on Wednesday evening, citing people familiar with the matter. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said bids for the bank must be submitted by Friday, the report said.  The New York-based bank’s weekend closure came two days after the collapse of another bank, California-based Silicon Valley Bank, and less than a week after the voluntary closure of another California-based bank, Silvergate Bank. All three of the now-defunct banks were considered crypto-friendly financial institutions.  Signature Bank, whose crypto clients accounted for a quarter of its deposits, was reportedly under investigation by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for potentially lax monitoring that may have enabled money laundering.  A class-action lawsuit was filed against Signature Bank in February, alleging the bank knew about – and facilitated – the “now infamous FTX fraud.” Specifically, the suit accuses Signature Bank of having knowledge of and permitting “the commingling of [the FTX exchange's] customer funds within its proprietary, blockchain-based payments network, Signet.”  Many in the crypto industry – including former acting Comptroller of the Currency, and one-time Binance.US CEO, Brian Brooks – have speculated the closure of the three banks is indicative of a coordinated effort by regulators to choke the crypto industry off from the banking system.  Barney Frank, a Signature Bank board member and former Democratic U.S. congressman who co-authored the Dodd-Frank Act, also suggested the takeover was spurred by an anti-crypto motive, telling CNBC that Signature Bank was solvent – and that regulators intervened anyway to send a message.  “I think part of what happened was that regulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message,” Frank told CNBC.  However, the New York Department of Financial Services has denied that crypto had anything to do with its decision to shutter Signature Bank, instead saying that was due to a “crisis of confidence” in the bank’s leadership.

42387871,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQw1Dv,1678933092,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Dips Below $25K as Market Worries About Liquidity,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether are coming off a multi-day rally, slipping into the red.  Insights: Bitcoin and ether volatility stunned bears and bulls alike over a 24-hour period earlier this week. Was the price movement the result of the bank crisis?  Prices  Bitcoin Dips Below $25K as Market Debates Liquidity  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,089 −28.3 ▼ 2.5% Bitcoin (BTC) $24,330 −621.2 ▼ 2.5% Ethereum (ETH) $1,649 −63.7 ▼ 3.7% S&P 500  3,891.93 −27.4 ▼ 0.7% Gold  $1,919 +12.6 ▲ 0.7% Nikkei 225  27,229.48 +7.4 ▲ 0.0% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin and ether began the Asia trading day in the red, with bitcoin declining 2.5% to $24,330 and ether declining 3.7% to $1,649.  Liquidity is on everyone’s mind, especially in the face of record drawdowns from the Treasury General Account during the COVID-19 era, and more after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.  Most recently, something appears to have spooked the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as it replaced $40 billion in funds it took from the TGA, initially earmarked to help ease market disruptions from the closure of SVB.  As Reuters recently reported, over the past week the TGA was down nearly $100 billion before the FDIC returned its $40 billion.  “The TGA was drawn down all during 2023, and that helped markets in general including bitcoin. But as of late in the last five days, the TGA had nothing to do with bitcoin's outperformance,” Mark Connors, head of research at 3iQ, told CoinDesk in a note. “There's a little more confidence that the bitcoin thesis is not just intact, but it's been validated at a level that we've never seen before.”  Connors says this is a question of confidence for the Federal Reserve.  “When you see the Fed creating a bubble, popping the bubble and then not knowing which game to play by inflation, or stabilize financial markets, it does not instill confidence,” he continued.  A bigger question at hand is rate volatility, according to Connors, and the market hates uncertainty.  “The reason that's important is because rates are used to price every asset on the planet,” he said. “And when you have uncertainty on interest rates, you have uncertainty on what everything is worth.”  The next meeting of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to take place March 21-22.

Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Bitcoin and ether briefly inched above $26,000 and $1,770 respectively on Tuesday as investors brushed off the long-term effects of a regulatory clampdown on crypto-friendly banks and U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data pointed to slowing inflation in the coming months.  Bitcoin's weekly chart shows the cryptocurrency is again struggling to establish a foothold above $25,000, which capped gains last month and in August 2022. According to chartered market technician Aksel Kibar, a breakout above $25,000 would shift focus to the next hurdle at $28,600. ""All About Bitcoin"" host Christine Lee breaks down the ""Chart of the Day.""  But the euphoria was short-lived as both major tokens dipped as much as 5% from Tuesday's highs before gradually stabilizing. In Asian morning hours on Wednesday, bitcoin traded just under $25,000 while ether traded slightly over $1,700.  The volatility caused over $140 million in bitcoin futures and $80 million in ether futures to take on losses. Of this, 58% of futures losses came from shorts, or bets against price rises, while the remaining came from longs, or bets on price rises – meaning both short sellers and long traders were hit almost equally.  Among other major tokens, futures on Conflux's CFX tokens and Filecoin's FIL had $8 million and $5 million in liquidations, respectively, as trading volumes for both surged on fundamental developments.  Meanwhile, some market observers said the price action came as investors looked for alternative assets following last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.  ""Bitcoin's rally to a new yearly high as Silicon Valley Bank falls and inflation remains stubborn shows that investors are looking to bitcoin for stability in highly uncertain market conditions,"" Alex Adelman, co-founder of bitcoin rewards app Lolli, told CoinDesk.  ""While many have looked to bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and tracked its price moves accordingly, bitcoin's relationship to traditional finance is more complex,"" Adelman stated, adding that bitcoin worked as an ""alternative to the traditional financial system at large.""  ""Weakness across the banking sector has heightened investor awareness of bitcoin's unique value proposition. In the coming weeks, we will continue to see increased demand for bitcoin as a superior system for holding and moving money securely,"" Adelman said.
