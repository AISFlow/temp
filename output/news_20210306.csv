42433843,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5iVh,1615053448,"US Senate Approves $1.9T Stimulus Plan, Measure Returns to the House","The U.S. Senate passed President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package Saturday, a possible positive development for cryptocurrencies.    The measure, which was passed by a 50-49 party-line vote, now heads back to the U.S. House, which would have to approve Senate changes to the package before the bill can go to the president for signing.  The House is expected to take up the measure next week, according to The Wall Street Journal.  The legislation would provide $300 in weekly unemployment benefits until early September, send $1,400 payments to some Americans and direct $350 billion in aid to state and local governments.    Why this matters to the crypto world:    Because the stimulus package would likely be a boost for stock markets, it could also provide a lift to the price of cryptocurrencies, particularly if stimulus check recipients use that money to buy cryptocurrencies.  Crypto investors have been betting for months that the flood of government and central bank spending to fight the coronavirus-caused economic slowdown will eventually lead to inflation, which would also be beneficial for bitcoin.  All the stimulus is calling into question the independence of the Federal Reserve, which to prevent short-term economic ruin has been basically printing money with abandon, leaving itself open to criticism about the mountain of debt these spending sprees are creating.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) moved back into positive territory after news of the bill's passage broke, quickly rising $500.

42433847,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5idh,1615042775,Into the Money-verse: Central Banks Under Siege in 2028,"We dive into the money-verse again to imagine how the choices being made today will shape the future of money. Once dominant, sovereign currencies are facing increasing competition, from bitcoin to diem and beyond. It is true that private currencies, and bitcoin in particular, have so far failed to promote the monetary revolution many people expected.      If, however, governments and central banks can’t offer a sound version of the sovereign money for the digital age, their downfall could be tragic. Let’s catch a glimpse of Washington, D.C., in 2028 to explore how the money wars could play out.    Marcelo M. Prates, a CoinDesk columnist, is a central bank lawyer and researcher.    On the outskirts of the capital, it’s possible to see drones dropping bags of money in the neighborhoods most affected by the latest cyberattack on the e-Gov platform. It isn’t clear yet if the attack came from a domestic rebel or a foreign foe. But with the e-Gov platform down, nobody can transfer digital dollars or even check their FedAccount balance.      When designing digital dollars, the government decided that FedAccounts shouldn’t offer an offline option. The concern was that people would finance domestic terrorism with an offline FedCoin that could be transferred from person to person without identification. Any project that involved anonymous transactions became a nonstarter after the second U.S. Capitol invasion.      See also: Jeff Wilser - The Man Who Forecast a Currency Cold War      Because of this limitation, every time the e-Gov platform is attacked, the government has to send military drones to disperse old dollar bills that can be used to make everyday payments until the platform is back on. That has been the reality since the money wars started in earnest.      After several years agonizing over the right model for digital dollars, the U.S. Federal Reserve had to rush its introduction in 2024. Since millions were moving every day to BTAs, the global cryptocurrency the BigTech Alliance launched the year before, the demand for dollars was falling fast while inflation started to climb at a record pace.      The massive fiscal expansion of the early 2020s was finally taking its toll, and the government could no longer roll over its soaring debt. The situation was so dire that, to avoid a massive default on U.S. Treasurys, the Federal Reserve had to print money and pay off all the bonds maturing in the last quarter of 2023.      The rapid migration from the traditional monetary and financial systems to the BigTech Alliance platform also affected banks. With customers converting deposits into BTAs and using favorable loans from the Alliance to consolidate other debts, most banks failed. The wave of failures accelerated the shift of financial intermediation toward the hands of the BigTech Alliance.      The debacle wasn’t just a result of the Federal Reserve’s long-lasting ambivalence about digital dollars. Many believe the breaking point came when the government insisted on having exclusive control over the digital ID scheme created to provide every American citizen and corporation with a single digital identity. The goal was to keep track of the vaccination progress amid different coronavirus variants and better target the relief money sent monthly.      But despite different voices in favor of a federated approach, including banks, consumer advocacy groups and scholars, the government opted for a centralized scheme that didn’t allow the participation of any private party. The decision was seen as a further step toward the growing surveillance state.      The alternative platforms thrived after the digital ID scheme was implemented. The number of members of a then-fringe group created by many of the “deplatformed” increased 10-fold in the first months of 2023. They could finally dream of confronting not only the U.S. government but the Big Tech companies that had cut their access to the traditional networks.      The rise of the BigTech Alliance was even more impressive, attracting more than 200 million people to its platform in the same period. They were able to build a country within the country, and the creation of their own money was a stinging blow to the dollar and the U.S. public finances.

Rolling back the contested digital ID scheme, creating a simple yet stable e-Gov platform and offering digital dollars in partnership with the surviving banks helped the government regain some trust. The challenge is to resist the constant attacks from the other platforms and fight back.      It’s clear by now that, with technology, different monetary arrangements are possible. Money does not need to be controlled by a government or limited to a sovereign territory anymore. Sure, as the American economist Hyman Minsky underscored 35 years ago, “Everyone can create money; the problem is to get it accepted.”      At this point, though, Minsky’s warning may also apply to central banks designing digital currencies: Either they get it right, or they risk becoming redundant.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Marcelo M.

The report, which was produced in February and obtained by CoinDesk on Friday, has been distributed to clients of JPMorgan Private Bank, which requires a minimum balance of $10 million to open an account.      The move comes after CNBC reported in February that JPMorgan co-President Daniel Pinto claimed ""demand isn't there yet"" from clients for crypto services, but it ""will be there at some point.""      The report breaks down how bitcoin could be valued, applying three different metrics, including the number of users, the value of gold and the global money supply.      1. If applying a version of Metcalfe's law – that bitcoin's value is proportional to the square of the number of users – it would be worth $21,667.      2. If applying the current value of gold to the max supply of 21 million bitcoin, it would be valued at $540,814.      3. If applying the global value of money to bitcoin's max supply, it would be valued at $1.9 million.      The report plays down bitcoin's common comparison to gold. Bitcoin has ""diversifying"" properties, but its ""volatility characteristics and correlation profile refute the comparison to the traditional safe haven asset,"" the report states.

42433845,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5iXh,1614991988,Bidding Reaches $2.5M as Twitter’s Dorsey Highlights NFT Version of First-Ever Tweet,"Bidding on the genesis tweet is heating up.      On Friday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called attention to a tokenized version of his first tweet on the non-fungible token (NFT) platform Valuables. Even though the 2006 tweet was minted in December 2020, Dorsey's Friday tweet has ignited a bidding war, reflecting today's frothy market for crypto collectibles.      As of early Saturday afternoon, the high bid was $2.5 million, made by Sina Estavi, whose LinkedIn profile describes him as CEO of Malaysia-based (and TRON-affiliated) Bridge Oracle. Estavi has been vying for the historic tweet with Justin Sun, the founder of TRON and the CEO of BitTorrent.      Valuables is an Ethereum-based platform created by the social network Cent that allows users of Twitter to authenticate their tweets for sale to others (think of them as digitally signed copies). The tokenized tweets are only sold when the author of the tweet accepts a bid.      Anyone can offer to buy a tweet on the platform. For example, the first bid for the tweet in question was $1 from @TheGaloisCxn on Dec. 15, 2020.      This is the tweet that Estavi apparently now thinks is worth $2.5 million:      Dorsey is a well-known fan of bitcoin, making multiple forays into the space. Cash App, from his other company, Square, is a major venue for retail investors to purchase the cryptocurrency. Dorsey also invested in Lightning Labs, a second layer on the Bitcoin network, seen as a scaling solution.      This is Dorsey's first time showing interest in Ethereum. Many people around the tech industry suggested that the recent boom in NFTs may partially explain Square's announcement Thursday that it would acquire the music streaming site Tidal (prior to that announcement, Dorsey announced a collaboration with rapper Jay-Z to expand the use of bitcoin in Africa).      The fight over the first-ever tweet on an Ethereum-based platform should only add fuel to that fire.      UPDATE (March 6, 13:24 UTC): Updates with latest bidding.
