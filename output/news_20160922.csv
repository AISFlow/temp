42399347,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixWe,1474575059,New Lawsuit Filed Against Xapo Founder Wences Casares,"Identity-theft protection company Lifelock has filed another lawsuit against Wences Casares, founder of bitcoin wallet company Xapo.  The suit was filed on Monday in Delaware Chancery Court against Casares and his former CFO at digital wallet startup Lemon, Cynthia McAdam, who currently serves as president and general counsel for Xapo.  LifeLock has alleged that the two withheld intellectual property related to Xapo and bitcoin integration software for Lemon that should have been included a 2013 acquisition of the startup by LifeLock, according to Courthouse News.  The suit also alleges that both Casares and McAdam worked on developing Xapo during a transition period when they were under the employ of Lifelock.  The complaint states:  ""Defendants' post-merger employment was little more than a ruse because while employed by Lemon, in Lemon offices, on Lemon computers and on Lemon-owned cloud server accounts, during Lemon-paid business hours, and using Lemon IP, defendants simply plotted their exit to Xapo while devoting the majority of their time to developing Xapo products.""  Lifelock filed a similar lawsuit last year against Casares in the Superior Court of the State of California, a suit which was eventually dismissed.  Within a month of the first report of the original California suit, Casares filed a cross-complaint at California's Superior Court, alleging that LifeLock had “squandered the success of its acquired company, and then sought to blame everyone but themselves for their mistakes"".  Earlier this year, that first case was dismissed. Lifelock has appealed the dismissal, a process which has met with additional delays. The most recent complaint was filed in Delaware because a stipulation in the merger agreement, according to a Lifelock representative.  Suits tied to Lemon purchase  In December 2013, Lifelock purchased Lemon for $42.6m. Shortly after the acquisition of Lemon, Casares announced the launch of bitcoin wallet company Xapo, along with $20m in new venture capital. Four months later, Xapo raised an additional $20m from Greylock Partners and Index Ventures.  LifeLock says it bought the digital wallet company for its intellectual property, including the wallet ""to securely store private credit card and other account information on their smart phones,"" according to the suit.  In comments, Ragland was dismissive of LifeLock's latest attempt to sue.  ""Whatever their motivations are, they’ve obviously decided to throw even more money into what I consider a personal vendetta,"" he told CoinDesk.  LifeLock did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael del Castillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/09/22/new-lawsuit-filed-against-xapo-founder-wences-casares,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1de6f9ae675c05a52e3830849001cbdef21a6fe0-1479x992.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42399366,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixiS,1474568401,"At Ethereum Mega-Event, the 'Church of Vitalik' Sobers Up","""It's a really different feeling.""  That was the sentiment of Rebecca Migirov, one of many ethereum startup employees gathered in Shanghai for the blockchain platform's second annual conference, and she was not alone in her assessment. If last year's Devcon1 was characterized by a lightning-strike excitement, the sophomore follow-up, attendees said, was less a celebration of ""underdogs"" and more of an acceptance of its limitations, a chance to refine its goals.  Still, present at Devcon2 was the ambitious vision, the affirmation of the community's belief that the blockchain can provide the Internet with a new and more radical architecture. Expressions of these aspirations, however, were more subdued, more apt to be abutted by the acceptance that in the heart of a zeitgeist, work must go on.  On stage, this could be heard in presentations by developers like Alex Van de Sande, lead UX designer for the project. In a talk on Wednesday, Van de Sande referenced his role in the creation of the official ethereum website, apologizing (if only slightly) for his now controversial description of the group's creations as ""unstoppable applications"".  Van de Sande told the audience:  ""We do have some outrageous claims... I'm sorry, I put them there. [But] I'm here to explain why we still stand for every word.""  The statement cuts to the heart of the three-day conference and its events, which were colored in no small part by this summer's high-profile collapse of The DAO. Ethereum, a project that can be loosely defined as an open-source blockchain effort inspired by (but that is arguably more ambitious than) bitcoin, has seen its reputation suffer amid setbacks and in-fighting.  This year's Devcon2 offered proof that the impact has been felt, and that not only investors lost.  ""Everyone was a bit down after The DAO,"" Pelle Braendgaard, lead developer at blockchain identity project uPort, explained. ""For a couple months, a lot of productivity stopped.""  But as it has resumed, Braendgaard asserted that there have been positive advancements. In interviews with attendees, most reported that this loss of momentum is best seen as a pause for reflection, a sign that, despite the negative headlines, the community is capable of moving on, of achieving renewed direction and purpose.  ""In the first year, everything was just smoke,"" technology consultant Carlos Buendia Gallego said. ""Now we're building real things.""  Developers, developers, developers  And in a market that needs buildings, there is perhaps no more prized commodity than the builders, as the conference provided evidence that a key element fueling ethereum is its emphasis on appealing to developers.  Whereas early bitcoin conferences were dominated by CEOs, VCs and regulators, Devcon2 placed a firm emphasis on technology that was all but missing accompanying propaganda, think 'What can ethereum do for you?'  Ample time was given to deep dives into base-level components of the network, such as the ethereum virtual machine and its smart contracting language, Solidity. In many, there was scarcely an explanation of the concepts.  Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, noted that he was struck by the conference's focus on development, as well as the sheer number of coders that attended.  ""Developers, normally, it's not like they have the highest budgets, but they commit themselves because they're convinced and they're fascinated by the project. Seeing such a big conference gives me a great optimism,"" he said.  SmartContract CEO Sergey Nazarov, an entrepreneur in the ecosystem since the early days of ""blockchain"", reported that he was left with the feeling that there is something special about to project, something that makes it unique among the increasing number of blockchain initiatives offering similar sales pitches.  ""I am starting to appreciate how developer-centric all these guys are. It filters down into people who make things. It attracts a certain mindset from all these other folks trying to make easier development tools,"" Nazarov said.  That ethereum's momentum is helping it retain a growing developer pool is not unnoticed by representatives of the conference's sponsors, who were quick to note that they see this as a key advantage for their business, as well as their clients.  Marley Gray, director of technical strategy and business development at Microsoft, for instance, cited ethereum's open-source community as a reason the tech giant remains committed to supporting public blockchain projects.  ""You have the developer resource pool and that's a big pain point in industries,"" he told CoinDesk.  Additional statements revealed he has a strong personal alignment with the project's larger vision.  ""The Internet still functions on 1970s technology. You send an email, it's in plain text. You access a web page, it's plain text. Our data is leaked by companies all the time, our identities are stolen by hackers, our behavior is monetized by advertisers,"" he continued, adding:  ""I think it's our job to help build a better Internet.""  'Church of Vitalik'  In many ways, the event was evidence that, despite the rhetoric about divisions in the community, ethereum remains oddly united in the face of obstacles. This sentiment was perhaps most visible in references to ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, with many developers (even insiders) jokingly calling the community the ""church of Vitalik"".  But every religion has its dissenters, and the conference began with a not insignificant network issue whereby all of the nodes running ethereum's most popular client (go ethereum) suddenly crashed upon executing a smart contract.  Called ""Fahrt nach Hause"" (German for 'Go Home', the contract was widely seen as a purposeful way to sour the proceedings, a way to voice the still-lingering discontent many have about The DAO and its demise.  Indeed, the event kickoff was delayed by 30 minutes, and rumors suggest that this was a last-minute plan by conference organizers to begin the show with the announcement that a fix had been implement. Early on, the issue was discussed in fits and whispers, spreading from peer to peer like transactions on the network itself.  Still, the quick resolution appeared effective, both at rectifying an issue on the platform and in quelling concerns.  ""What impressed me was how almost nobody was phased by this whole geth client thing,"" Nazarov told CoinDesk.  Yet, there was a sense of unease about the event under the surface, and signs that it exposed just how precarious the experimental features that unite the technical features are today.  Ethcore chief financial officer TJ Shaw, who was there to debut an alternative client called Parity, suggested that while his startup's latest work helped stem the damage, any lesser efforts could have risked coloring the conference.  ""We are happy that the network didn't go down. Shanghai Devcon would be completely destroyed if the network went down,"" he said.  'Let's invent it' syndrome  In this light, the issue with the go ethereum client can be seen as evidence that ethereum is still striving to reach its ambitions. While this perhaps can't be described as a fake-it-until-you-make-it ethos, there's a sense that issues can only be solved slowly and with time.  But for IBM's Henning Diedrich, Devcon2 showcased how the community is becoming more aware and understanding of where its limitations lie. He said the geth incident was ""no surprise"" given his own experience with ethereum.  ""At IBM, I've been debugging the go client. You have to wonder, anyone who really tries to use it, or 50% of projects that try to do something with it, should have run into this bug. I've been asking around and other people know about them, too,"" he said.  Everywhere you look, similar ""issues"" could be found, but a closer inspection perhaps reveals this as a limited way to look at the ecosystem. What can appear from afar like bad management may be better described as a culture that promotes competing ideas.  Developer Viktor Tron, for instance, has been working for months on a distributed file sharing system called Swarm that was envisioned as an integral part of the network. But as it approaches its testnet, even he remains uncertain how to read the growing enthusiasm for the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), a project developed outside the community and backed by VCs like Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  Tron acknowledged that the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that promotes development, may have a ""let's invent it"" syndrome.  ""Why do we have [recursive length prefix] RIP. It's a serialization format that Vitalk [Buterin] came up with, and a lot of people asked, 'Why did we need a serialization format?' It's already done by everyone,"" he said.  As for how this relates to his own project, he's less sure, though he said that competition is perhaps the best way to ensure the strongest ideas win out in a real marketplace.  ""At this stage, this is such a new area, there's lots of research and it's probably healthy for the ecosystem for these creative groups to be separate,"" he said.  From here to somewhere  But if ethereum remains a bleeding-edge technology, there were also signs that, far from stagnating, its message is attracting new blood.  Freelance developers could be found in attendance, drawn by what they said was a vision for a ""Web 3.0"" that extends beyond how other cryptocurrency efforts have sought to apply innovations in blockchain technology.  ""The ethereum community is good at envisioning these future applications,"" developer Cameron Voell said, explaining his own interest. ""Maybe in other groups they focus too much on trading and stuff like that.""  This appeal extends even to China, where a local ethereum group ""Ethfans"" was well represented, as were college graduates like Yating Shu, there to check out the next big thing.  But if amidst the swirl of lights and ideas the conference seemed to be veering too far into the surreal, there were moments that validated the strengths that in-person meetups provide to even distributed communities.  Whether it was learning that the ethereum virtual machine is being rebuilt by someone who lives in an old camper van or meeting executives from some of the world's largest banks who are betting that these same individuals will create a structure for the future of finance, the event seemed at times an elaborate reminder of how technologies are still created by humans.  In a rare instance, this reporter met the father of Vitalik Buterin himself, a muscular Russian who would look more at home in wrestling ring than in the halls of a Hyatt on the Shanghai waterfront.  In the moments that followed, words seemed lost as he showed pictures of a baby with blue eyes in cell phone pictures, the eyes looking the same locked on a 1990s desktop computer as they did onstage.  ""I'm sorry, I said. ""It's hard to believe he came from anywhere.""  Buterin smiled and answered: ""Well, he had to come from somewhere.""  It may be a testament to where the project is headed that such a simple truth could seem the hardest thing to believe of all.

42399410,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbixmO,1474563459,Roger Ver Sues Bitcoin Exchange OKCoin For $570k,"UPDATE (22nd September 20:23 BST): This article has been updated with new statements from Roger Ver.      In the latest round of a long-standing feud, bitcoin investor Roger Ver has reportedly sued digital currency exchange OKCoin for $570,000.  According to the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong High Court document filed Wednesday shows that Ver alleges that OKCoin violated the terms of a contract for work the website Bitcoin.com. In late 2014, Ver and the bitcoin exchange initially joined forces to work on the website. OKCoin was tasked with a website redesign and SEO.  One snippet of the contract specifies a partnership of a minimum of five years. This is the piece that has been the subject of controversy.  Ver claims that the exchange forged the newest version of the contract, which adds that OKcoin can terminate the contract within 6 months, and that the five-year minimum still stands. Ver is seeking $10,000 for each month of the remaining contract duration.  ""The short version is that they forged my signature onto a fake contract and the digital signatures prove it beyond any doubt,"" Ver said in an emailed statement.  He claims that OKCoin is in violation of both the real contract and the alleged forged version. OKCoin CEO Star Xu was named as an individual defendant.  Former OKCoin chief technology officer Changpeng Zhao later backed up Ver’s claims that the latest version is a forgery. At the time, the exchange denied the allegations.  Ver and representatives of OKCoin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42399348,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiwKr,1474552239,Symbiont Showcases Blockchain Catastrophe Swaps to Insurance Execs,"The next time a tornado obliterates land and property in California or Ohio, Symbiont’s newly unveiled catastrophe swaps blockchain platform could help speed up how quickly the victims get paid out.  Mississippi, on the other hand, could be out of luck.  A prominent New York-based blockchain startup, Symbiont demonstrated a system of smart contracts integrated with its secretive Assembly blockchain earlier this month, showcasing how it can facilitate the automatic dispersal of funds to a group of insurers, reinsurers, investors and media.  Though Symbiont has yet to reveal the innerworkings of Assembly's technology, Ron Papanek, the company's head of product, described it to CoinDesk as ""an extremely mature"" platform capable of conducting 80,000 transactions per second.  Though this particular demo was for an insurance product, Papanek said that Assembly could run a wide range of business-specific use cases, with little more than a new smart contract, or self-executing code.  Papanek said in interview:  ""This particular application was built very rapidly, to demonstrate the capabilities of the system, and depending on market demand, could be expanded to cover the necessary edge cases quickly as well.""  Breaking down swaps  To begin, an insurance company would propose a swap by inputting details into the insurance smart contract, including the covered event threshold, the fixed rate payment, the currency, the floating rate, the effective dates and the payer, which in this case would be the reinsurance agent.  Then, the smart contract is uploaded to the private blockchain. It became visible almost instantly for the reinsurance agent, whose screen could be seen side-by-side with the insurance agent’s interface.  The contract however, was not active upon upload, but rather needed to be approved by the reinsurance agent. Once approved, a PDF of the ISDA version of the contract could be downloaded with all the data being tracked via the blockchain, marked in red.  “Both parties now have complete documentation of the existence of this contract,” Papanek explained.  At this point, Papanek filled out a report on behalf of what would have been a report providing agency in a live use case. Specifically, Symbiont's head of product unleashed two imaginary “wind events” in the states of California, Ohio and Mississippi. In a real-life application, data about such events would have been provided by Verisk Analytics.  Using a feature called “Time Travel” specifically created to demonstrate the smart contract's functionality, time was rolled forward and the terms of coverage logged on the blockchain were cross-referenced with catastrophes. While $1m was paid out to California and Ohio, the terms of the coverage did not result in payment to Mississippi.  Had this been a real catastrophe, payment itself could have been conducted via a cryptocurrency, though Papanek said he thinks that’s unlikely to be done by insurance companies in the near future.  Instead, he thinks a “more common” way to transfer funds might be a token that represents a title to an account held by a custodian bank.  Blockchain insurance in the wild  The nodes of the Assembly blockchain, or ""containers"" as Symbiont describes them, can be hosted in the cloud or locally, and are managed by each of the participants. Keys can be managed by hardware security modules (HSMs) including the SafeNet Network HSM – formerly called Luna SA – and AWS Cloud HSM.  Each node is granted custom access to transaction data, where some parties might be privy to certain transaction data, but not others, and some parties might have access to only specific names, for example.  The Byzantine fault technology (BFT) at the heart of Assembly requires no mining to operate and doesn’t include a native cryptocurrency. The ledger can be adapted to a wide range of other industries, according to Papanek, by writing case-specific smart contracts.  Already, the New York City-based Symbiont has partnered with financial data firm Ipreo, which is co-owned by Blackstone and Goldman Sachs, to build financial service applications of the technology.  A 'who's who' of insurance  A total 81 investors and members of the insurance industry were in attendence at the demo on Tuesday.  During an informal poll at the beginning of the demo, about half the observers identified as just beginning to explore blockchain, while a few identified as experts.  Symbiont’s newly hired president and former Morgan Stanley managing director, Caitlin Long, described the group to CoinDesk as being composed of a “significant” number of participants from Europe and Asia.  She said:  ""It's literally a ""who's who"" of the insurance industry, from all around the world -- property/casualty insurers, life insurers, reinsurers, and several investors in insurance-linked securities too.""  The industry itself has looked into this particular use case in the past. In April, insurance giant John Hancock began its own internal blockchain tests. German insurance giant Allianz recently completed its own blockchain catastrophe swap tests with investment management firm Nephila.  But is it legally enforceable?  Following the demo, Papanek responded to a question from one of the observers about whether such contracts are legally enforceable.  He explained that even a more traditional written contract ""is only evidence to an agreement that parties have"". In this case, it would be up to the parties to determine whether a written contract takes priority over a code-based smart contract or if the smart contract might take priority.  Though Papanek left little doubt as to the direction he thinks the insurance industry will ultimately come to embrace.  He concluded:  ""We are certainly moving towards a world where code takes priority.""

The Beijing-based software development firm was the first of several major Chinese companies set to take the stage at the event, which will see participation from firms including Tencent-backed Webank, auto giant Wanxiang and blockchain consortium ChinaLedger.  In remarks today, Sinodata chairman Yedong Zhu discussed how it is seeking to build an ecosystem of Internet-based financial applications, and that it believes cross-industry collaboration is needed to advance blockchain.  Yedong told the audience:  ""We're honored to attend this summit and [believe] the application of blockchain is promising. [But] we think that for any technology to succeed, it must demonstrate social and business value.""  Yedong’s talk followed a longer introduction by fellow sponsor IBM, which detailed how it is using blockchain for applications in its own business. This included an overview of how a use case for blockchain as a way to ensure the safety and soundness of airplane machine components.
