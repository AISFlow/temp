42429704,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0ovh,1537569050,"The Latest Bitcoin Bug Was So Bad, Developers Kept Its Full Details a Secret","This week's major bitcoin bug was even worse than developers initially let on.  The bug originally rocked the bitcoin world when it was reported the vulnerability could be used to shut down a chunk of the network.  While this sounded bad enough for many, it turns out developers for Bitcoin Core kept a second, bigger part of the bug a secret. As disclosed through an official Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) report, an attacker could have actually used it to create new bitcoin – above the 21 million hard-cap of coin creation – thereby inflating the supply and devaluing current bitcoins.  Such a perversion of the rules would, at worst, according to many, make users not trust the cryptocurrency anymore.  Because of the disastrous implications of the bug, developers decided to keep it a secret, buying themselves time to fix the exploit and urge miners and users to upgrade their software.  The CVE report written by Bitcoin Core developers explains:  ""In order to encourage rapid upgrades, the decision was made to immediately patch and disclose the less serious denial of service vulnerability, concurrently with reaching out to miners, businesses and other affected systems, while delaying publication of the full issue to give time for systems to upgrade.""  And for now, the plan seems to have worked.  Over half of bitcoin's mining hash rate has upgraded to the patched software version, meaning the attack can no longer be used, and developers are ""unaware of any attempts to exploit this vulnerability,"" the report states.  Who found it?  Finding such a serious bug was a stressful position for developers to be in.  According to the report, an anonymous user originally filed a report about the denial-of-service bug to top developers of Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin ABC, the main software implementation of bitcoin cash. About two hours later, Chaincode engineer and Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo realized the bug could have been exploited to print unlimited bitcoin.  Based on the seriousness of the vulnerability, the developers decided to keep those details secret at first.  Instead, beginning with Slush Pool, they started pushing miners to upgrade. And for bitcoin users running a full node, the call to action is the same.  ""You should not run any version of Bitcoin Core other than 0.16.3. Older versions should not exist on the network. If you know anyone who is running an older version, tell them to upgrade it ASAP,"" bitcoin subreddit moderator Theymos remarked in a post currently pinned to the top of the forum.  Yet, another problem exists now – the possibility of a bitcoin chain split  Since users are now running different versions of the bitcoin software, there's a risk the network will temporarily split into two, then come back together again. Transactions on the chain running old software, then, might ultimately be lost.  While the situation is being monitored closely, Theymos thinks the risk of this happening is small. But, he argued that people should still take precautions, such as waiting longer to make sure a bitcoin transaction actually gets verified.  Theymos added:  ""For the next week or so you should consider there to be a small possibility of any transaction with less than 200 confirmations being reversed.""  Fake bitcoin?  What's on some users' minds, still though, is whether it's possible the bug has already been exploited.  ""How do we know if that vulnerability wasn't exploited already and there is someone out there with a bunch of fake bitcoin?"" asked one bitcoin user.  Luckily, Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille explained, due to the power of code, bitcoin users would have been able to detect suspicious activity by now.  When downloaded for the first time, full nodes double check every transaction made in bitcoin's history. A node running the new software, 0.16.3, would detect the problem immediately.  Even so, questions remain regarding what would have happened if the bug wasn't caught in time.  According to Theymos: ""Even if the bug had been exploited to its full extent, the theoretical damage to stored funds would have been rolled back.""  Theymos continued, saying that rollback would be much like what happened during the so-called ""value overflow incident"" in 2010 when 187 billion bitcoins were created out of thin air but, ultimately, were destroyed.  Still, while Bitcoin Core, litecoin and several other coins that were based Bitcoin Core's code have released a patch for the exploit, others have not – and might still be vulnerable to the inflation bug.

42429724,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0pPh,1537564966,XRP Shot Up 75% During Friday's Bullish Trading Session,"The price of XRP spiked as high as 75 percent above its opening price at one point during Friday's trading session amidst a broader market bull parade.  At roughly 14:45 UTC, the price of XRP rose to a peak of $0.77 - representing a 75 percent increase from its opening price of $0.45, according to CoinDesk's XRP Price Index (XPI).  For several hours, the surge in investor interest was enough for the cryptocurrency to briefly dethrone ether (ETH) as the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. At the time, XRP's market capitalization was north of $23 billion, its highest level since June 10th.  At press time, XRP has since cooled off to the price of roughly $0.54 and has returned to its former position as the world third largest cryptocurrency, per CoinMarketCap's rankings.  During the trading frenzy, XRP surpassed multiple milestones not seen since the famous bull run of 2017.  For one, XRP/USD has already posted its most daily trading volume since January 14th on the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. At the time of writing, three hours still remain in the trading day, so it's likely the cryptocurrency will surpass that mark and record its most trading volume ever on Bitfinex, which has offered XRP trading since May of 2017.  Further, today's price high of XRP marked a 192 percent rise since Sept 18, its best-performing, four-day stretch since December of last year. The price surged allowed XRP to reach its highest price point since May 10th.  Current XRP prices still represent an 84 percent depreciation from its all-time high of $3.48 set in January, but technical charts indicate that the price could be beginning to chart its way back to those heights.  XRP bulls were not the only ones on a parade today as the entire market picked up the bid in an illustrious way.  All of the top 10 cryptocurrencies are flashing green as of the time of writing and currently posting an average 24-hour gain of 17.67 percent, excluding Tether (USDT). After XRP, standout performers include ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), stellar (XLM) and cardano (ADA).  Consequently, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has seen a notable uptick of more than $20 billion over the past 24-hours. Its current value stands just above $224.1 billion representing a 10 percent increase from this time yesterday and its highest mark since September 5.

Grupo XP, which owns brokerage firm XP Investimentos, plans to launch the platform in the ""coming months,"" the news source said, adding it will support trading in bitcoin and ethereum.  However, despite the notable move, the firm seems a little reluctant to dip their toe in the crypto waters.  Speaking at an event in Sao Paulo, the firm's executive officer, Guilherme Benchimol, said:  ""I must confess, this is a theme I'd rather didn't exist, but it does. We felt obligated to start advancing in this market.""  Benchimol was quoted as saying that the firm made the decision to launch the exchange – dubbed XDEX – because 3 million or so Brazilians already own some bitcoin, while far fewer, around 600,000, have holdings in stocks.  The move by Grupo XP comes as the environment for crypto exchanges in the country may be about to ease.  Brazil's antitrust watchdog said this week that it is investigating whether major banks in the country worked together to halt services to cryptocurrency-focused firms.

To that end, the lawmaker announced a trio of blockchain-focused bills Friday, saying he intends to introduce them into Congress in the coming weeks. The bills tackle a range of issues around the blockchain space, including development, miners and cryptocurrency-related taxes.  The bills are aimed at providing support for the nascent industry, a press release said.  In a statement, Emmer said that ""the United States should prioritize accelerating the development of blockchain technology and create an environment that enables the American private sector to lead on innovation and further growth.""  He added:  ""Legislators should be embracing emerging technologies and providing a clear regulatory system that allows them to flourish in the [U.S.].""  The bills specifically will touch on the regulatory approach to the space, essentially providing developers and users some leeway in building, mining or transacting with cryptocurrencies.  The first bill ""expresses support for the industry and its development"" within the U.S. by advocating for ""a light touch, consistent and simple legal environment.""  The second bill would ensure cryptocurrency miners do not need to register as money transmitters, as they ""never take control of consumer funds.""  This legislation would also include multisignature wallet providers.  The final bill would create a ""safe harbor"" for taxpayers who have any cryptocurrencies resulting from a network hard fork. The bill would prevent the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from levying any fines against taxpayers who try to report gains from these tokens, at least until the IRS provides clear guidance on how taxpayers can report such gains.  Emmer's new bills come the same day he and fellow Representative Bill Foster were named co-chairs of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, a group of lawmakers focused on spurring blockchain technology development through legislation in the U.S. government's lower house.  ""I am proud to join my colleagues to lead Congress so that policymakers and industry can work together to realize this promise and unleash its economic potential in the United States and around the world,"" Foster said in a statement.

42401905,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2un5,1537552809,Report Finds Cryptojacking Instances Jumped 400% In A Year,"Instances of cryptojacking malware have jumped more than 400 percent since last year, a new report finds.  A collaborative group of cybersecurity researchers called the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) published the report Wednesday, detailing the various and repercussions from cryptojacking – the illicit practice of hijacking a user's computer to mine cryptocurrencies.  Most notably, CTA points out in the research that the number of instances of illicit mining malware found has sharply spiked in the months from the close of 2017 to end of July 2018.  The report states:  ""Combined data from several CTA members shows a 459 percent increase in illicit cryptocurrency mining malware detections since 2017, and recent quarterly trend reports from CTA members show that this rapid growth shows no signs of slowing down.""  In the key findings document, the alliance points to a particular exploit that has been plaguing the security world for over a year, Eternalblue, as one of the leading causes.  Eternalblue is the infamous NSA exploit that was used in the Wannacry ransomware and NotPetya attacks.  The CTA's analysis explains that a number of Windows operating systems remain vulnerable to the bug, despite a patch released by Microsoft. As such, these systems run a vulnerable network file sharing protocol dubbed SMB1.  Malicious actors target these susceptible machines for their processing power, which even simple cryptojacking software can hijack.  In fact, these actors have even begun repurposing existing software to specifically mine cryptocurrencies, the report said, explaining:  ""Researchers noted in February 2018 that the BlackRuby Ransomware family began 'double dipping' by adding the open-source XMRig software to their tools to mine Monero. The VenusLocker Ransomware family completely shifted gears, dropping ransomware for Monero mining. The Mirai botnet, notable for its 2016 DDoS attack that used IoT devices to impact substantial portions of U.S. internet services, has since been repurposed into an IoT-mining botnet.""  Further, by decreasing the mining rate, the malware can easily and cheaply be scaled across a network in large organizations and persist on the host computer for a longer time, resulting in a larger pay-out.  Palo Alto Networks, one the partners in the alliance, found that Coinhive dominates in terms of software used by malicious actors, with some 23,000 websites containing Coinhive source code.  Moreover, the group of security firms has noticed that malicious actors are shifting their focus from traditional systems and personal computers to Internet-of-Things devices like smart TVs.  The CTA also stressed that the presence of cryptojacking malware may just be an indicator of how insecure a system is, saying, ""if miners can gain access to use the processing power of your networks, then you can be assured that more sophisticated actors may already have access.""

The market is experiencing ""seller fatigue,"" Novogratz contended while speaking at Yahoo Finance's second annual All Markets Summit on Thursday, and added further that bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is now on the upswing.  Indeed, bitcoin is showing signs of life, having persistently found takers around $6,000 in the last three months. Hence, the signs indicate that the bears have likely run dry.  Novogratz also took note of the ""classic bottom"" in Galaxy Digital's cryptocurrency index, which is down more than 80 percent from its peak.  The valuations are cheap by December standards, and that could entice bargain hunters and investors like Novogratz who view bitcoin as a store of value.  ""Bitcoin has held $6,000. Yes, it is off its highs, but it has established itself as a store of value,"" Novogratz said, according to a report from Reuters. The billionaire investor also told attendees that, in his view, plenty of money is waiting on the sidelines.

Just a day after Bitfury revealed a new 14nm mining chip called the Bitfury Clarke, Bitmain has upped the ante with the announcement of a new 7nm application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) processor that it says offers better hashing power and energy efficiency over older models.  The ASIC – a powerful type of chip designed for specific types of computation – was announced Friday by Jihan Wu, CEO and co-founder of the Beijing-based firm, at the World Digital Mining Summit in Tbilisi, Georgia.  Designed to mine cryptocurrencies using the SHA256 algorithm – a group that includes bitcoin – the ""BM1391"" chip will also be powering an upcoming range of Bitmain's Antminer series of mining machines, Wu said, according to a company blog post.  The company says BM1391 uses an advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology called 7nm FinFET, integrates ""more than a billion transistors"" and is optimized for energy efficiency. Wu further said said that, in tests, the chip ""can achieve a ratio of energy consumption to mining capacity that is as low as 42J/TH.""  So far the firm has not released detailed specifications for the new ASIC. However, Bitmain says it is now moving to mass-produce the new ASIC.  As reported by CoinDesk, Bitfury launched its 14nm Clarke chip Wednesday, saying it ""offers the strongest performance among bitcoin mining chips and is unparalleled in efficiency."" The ASIC is said to have power efficiency up to 55 mW/GH and a hashrate up to 120 GH/s.  In June, Japanese tech giant GMO also said it was launching the ""world's first"" 7nm ASIC, slating the first shipments for October.  According to a report at the time, the chip was to be fitted in a new miner called the B2.

Citing the Taiwan Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), CBS Austin said Wilson was arrested this morning. The arrest was seemingly confirmed by the Taiwan News, a 60-year-old media outlet based in the country.  CoinDesk was unable to confirm the arrest with the CIB as of press time.  The Central News Agency, a state-owned news organization, also reported the arrest, adding that Wilson would be deported to the U.S. ""as soon as possible.""  The Taiwan News further reported that Wilson was attempting to rent an apartment for six months at the time of his arrest. While he paid a deposit, he never collected his keys, and was later taken in by authorities.  Police from the city of Austin, Texas filed an affidavit against Wilson Wednesday, claiming he paid for sexual intercourse with a 16-year-old female last month. The act was first reported to police by a counselor who the victim confided in.  The affidavit details numerous instances of video surveillance connecting Wilson and the victim, as well as some of the testimony used to identify him.  Wilson is perhaps best known for the controversy surrounding his efforts to make plans for a 3D printed gun publicly available. He is in an ongoing legal battle with U.S. authorities over whether he has the right to distribute such plans through his company, Defense Distributed.  Prior to that, Wilson was known for helping to develop the DarkWallet, a privacy-focused bitcoin wallet.  Editor's note: Some statements in this article were translated from Chinese.

42401910,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2us0,1537534825,US Navy Launches Blockchain Research in Mission to Improve Tracking System,"A U.S. Navy command is exploring the potential of blockchain technology in tracking aircraft parts.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) – which provides material support for aircraft and airborne weapons systems for the navy – announced in a press release Friday it is investigating whether blockchain could trace parts through their life-cycle more efficiently and cost-effectively than with current methods.  ""Knowing the origin and history of flight-critical aircraft parts is a resource-consuming process that drives up the cost to operate military aircraft,"" NAVAIR explains.  With existing systems, after delivery, parts are tracked using a paper-based process and manually recorded on a database. However, the naval command has kick-started research that hopes to switch Naval Aviation Enterprise processes to a permissioned blockchain.  For the effort, a team at NAVAIR's Fleet Readiness Center Southwest has partnered with Indiana Technology and Manufacturing Companies (ITAMCO) to use its SIMBA Chain – a blockchain-as-a-service platform developed in conjunction with DARPA.  With the agreement, the navy is specifically eyeing SIMBA Chain protocols that it says can ""quickly and securely recall large data sets.""  Ultimately, the partners hope to develop a conceptual framework for a blockchain supply chain system that provides visibility and security.  The proof-of-concept will be a permissioned chain with a consensus mechanism that NAVAIR says requires less computing power than proof-of-work systems, as used by protocols like bitcoin.  According to the release, there are issues to overcome. A distributed supply chain increases vulnerability to outside attacks, so cyber-security is a vital area of focus.  ""By bringing the experts together early in the development of possible architectures, the navy command says, ""the authorities will better understand the risk and reward of a connected distributed system.  The team working on the research believes the increased visibility and traceability of a blockchain system will help NAVAIR support the Naval Air mission with an increased emphasis on safety and at a reduced cost, it adds.  As CoinDesk has reported previously, last June, the U.S. navy's innovation arm, too, has been working to trial blockchain's potential in bringing added security to its 3D-printing systems.  The trial, led by the Naval Innovation Advisory Council, was said to use blockchain to form a data-sharing layer between the navy's various 3D printing sites.

42401901,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2uk8,1537531229,"Tether's Impact on Bitcoin Price Not 'Statistically Significant,' Study Finds","The issuance of tether (USDT), the controversial cryptocurrency tied to the U.S. dollar's value, has had no meaningful impact on the price of bitcoin, an academic study has found.  The findings by Dr. Wang Chun Wei, a lecturer at the business school of Australia's University of Queensland, contradict widespread and long-running speculation that Tether, the company behind the stable cryptocurrency, has been issuing USDT to pump up the price of bitcoin.  Wei's findings have been accepted for the October 2018 issue of Economics Letters. (The paper was originally published online in May.)  In the paper, ""The Impact of Tether Grants on Bitcoin,"" he writes:  ""Our findings show that tether grants were potentially timed to follow bitcoin downturns and subsequent bitcoin/tether trading volumes increased ... However, the impact of tether grants on bitcoin returns were not statistically significant, and therefore tether issuances cannot be an effective tool for moving bitcoin prices.""  Tether is the market's leading stablecoin. It maintains a steady price of about $1, ostensibly by backing each USDT with one U.S. dollar in reserve – though this claim is often disputed and hard to verify since Tether has not published a full audit. While the token has been valuable to exchanges, at least one top-20 exchange has recently moved to shift to a new alternative.  Wei's research focuses on the volume of USDT in the market and changes to that volume. It does not address controversies around the amount of U.S. dollars actually backing USDT.  ""This is for regulators and auditors to determine,"" Wei writes.  Instead, the paper simply addresses whether or not the issuance of new USDT could be used to manipulate the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency. That critique of USDT has been articulated by the anonymous author of January's ""The Tether Report,"" who wrote:  ""The highly correlated growth between tether issuance and bitcoin price raises several interesting questions: Is bitcoin growth driving Tether? Is tether issuance driving bitcoin? If one were to assume the worst case scenario, that bitcoin's price has been artificially pumped up by tether issuance, one would expect the market price of bitcoin to be closer to $2,000 based on the trendline before April 2017 and the marked growth in tether issuance.""  Tether Limited issues new USDT periodically in large lots typically referred to as grants. According to Wei: ""The grants seem to occur in groups. I think Tether Limited breaks the grants into smaller blocks and issues them out over a couple of days.""  Wei summarized the critique of Tether Limited's detractors for CoinDesk, writing:  ""If tether tokens were not fully backed, then for the company to issue new tokens would be equivalent of printing money. If this was true, tether grants/issuances would be equivalent to 'monetary easing' in the cryptocurrency markets.""  In monetary or quantitative easing, an increased money supply aims to boost economic activity by expanding liquidity.  ""It was argued that most of the increased Tether was used to purchase bitcoin,"" Wei explained. ""My paper tries to test this theory out empirically. Is it true that tether grants pushed up bitcoin prices?""  No pump found  The paper notes that bitcoin-tether trading pairs dominate across major exchanges and that more than $2 billion worth of USDT exists on the market. Further, it notes that trading in bitcoin does increase following new USDT grants. Nevertheless, that observation can be misleading.  Acknowledging that trading volume is correlated with price, Wei went on to say: ""However, you cannot use trading volume to predict price, as the effect is simultaneous. In my paper, I state that past trading volumes do not impact future returns.""  To investigate these questions, Wei used two time-series models to input different variables over time and see if there was a causal relationship. The models specifically looked for evidence of changes going forward from new grants.  He uses an ""autoregressive distributed lag"" model and also an ""unrestricted vector autoregression"" (VAR). Both of these are ways of investigating whether or not there is a causal relationship between something in the past and something in the future.  Wei broke it down in layman's terms: ""We have a null model that tries to explain bitcoin returns using past bitcoin returns. We have a full model that tries to explain bitcoin returns using past bitcoin returns and past tether grants.""  He summarized:  ""We then show the full model isn't actually any better than the null model. Hence, past tether grants must have no impact on bitcoin returns.""  In other words, when you add variables about USDT, it doesn't show any direct impact on BTC returns any better than just looking at BTC on its own.  ""In fact, when we examine the bitcoin return equation of our VAR model, none of the lagged variables impacts bitcoin returns. This suggests bitcoin returns are showing greater signs of market efficiency than previously studied on older datasets,"" Wei writes in the paper.  Wei went on to argue that this makes intuitive sense, once the size of the bitcoin market is considered.  ""The grants come roughly at $100-250 million blocks. The daily trading volume of bitcoin is roughly $5-10 billion USD. At its peak, it was roughly $20 billion,"" he told CoinDesk. ""So the impact of tether is small. Claims saying that it is tether that props up bitcoin are definitely not true.""

42401920,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2v1q,1537527606,"$6,700: Bitcoin Price Charts Bullish Reversal as Altcoins Surge","Bitcoin (BTC) has taken a bullish turn over the last 24 hours, as sharp gains are also seen across a number of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).  As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,700 on Bitfinex – up 4.6 percent on a 24-hour basis – having hit a 16-day high of $6,745 earlier today.  BTC's recovery from the five-week low of $6,100 hit Wednesday was likely fueled by increased investor demand for altcoins. For instance, XRP – the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – has risen by 42 percent in the last 24 hours and 18 percent of the total XRP trading volume is coming from XRP/BTC pairs, according to CoinMarketCap.  Aurora (AOA) is up 57 percent on the day and is the best performing cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap. More importantly, about 60 percent of its total trading volume is also originating from pairs with BTC. On similar lines, MONA's 43 percent price rise is likely being fueled by MONA/BTC and MONA/JPY pairs, volume data shows.  It's worth noting that most alternative cryptocurrencies are traded against majors like BTC and ethereum's ETH token. So, money tends to flow into altcoins via BTC, creating upside pressure on the leading cryptocurrency.  As a result, BTC could be in for further gains if the altcoin rally keeps attracting investors to the market.  On the charts, the convincing move above $6,600 (Sept. 14 high) is painting a bullish picture, at least for the short-term.  Daily chart  As seen in the above chart, BTC moved past the double bottom neckline resistance of $6,600 earlier today, confirming a bullish reversal.  The cryptocurrency may well move to test the upper edge of the pennant pattern, currently located at $7,050, over the weekend.  A UTC close above that level would add credence to higher price lows set over the last three months and bring potential for a move towards July highs above $8,500.  View  BTC's recovery from $6,100 seen in the last 48 hours is likely associated with a surge in interest in altcoins.  The double bottom breakout has opened the doors to $7,050. A UTC close above that level would confirm a pennant breakout and boost the prospects of a sustained rally to $8,500.  On the downside, acceptance below $6,600 would neutralize the immediate bullish outlook. A UTC close below the pennant support will likely put the bears back in charge.

During a TV appearance on Thursday in which he addressed economic issues, Maduro announced the adoption of the petro in international trade starting from October. The announcement comes despite doubts cast by economists and analysts that the token would be accepted by the international markets, as reported by Reuters.  ""The Petro enters ... as a currency of exchange, purchase and convertible currencies for the world,"" he noted during his speech, according to a report from the state television channel.  It's so far unclear what exact sectors of the country's global trade businesses will use the token, which was officially launched in February.  Maduro added that the insertion of the petro into global trade comes after development and deployment of the token as part of the country's economic recovery program.  The news comes soon after Maduro announced the country's new fiat currency, the sovereign bolivar, will even be pegged to the oil-backed petro. He subsequently ordered domestic banks to use the petro as a unit of account.  CoinDesk also reported that, soon after the token's launch, Maduro made it a requirement for some state-owned businesses to convert a percentage of their sales into petros.  The token has been very controversial, however, with lawmakers in Venezuela declaring the plan to be ""illegal,"" and U.S. President Donald Trump also signing an executive order to impose new sanctions against the country banning dealings in the petro.

The Associated Press reported Thursday that the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) for the Golden State voted 3-1 on Thursday to prohibit political donations in cryptocurrencies, citing the difficulty of tracking the origin of such donations and concerns over political transparency.  The decision follows a hearing in August at which the FPPC discussed several election issues, including whether cryptos should be allowed in political donations. The committee didn't reach a conclusion at the time, needing a longer period to fully understand the issue.  While some commissioners at the hearing argued against an outright ban, others raised the question of how to verify the origin of a virtual currency donation.  With the decision now made, an FPPC representative told CoinDesk on Friday that there will still be further debate and analysis on the issue in the coming period, stating:  ""There was extensive research by staff, input from stakeholders that was publicly displayed on our website and public debate among the Commission today and that is the decision rendered. As was publicly stated by many if not all of the Commissioners, there will be further debate and analysis in the coming months and years.""  Currently, the U.S. Federal Election Commission allows candidates to accept cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as an in-kind donation, a ruling that was made back in 2014.  On a state level, some, such as South Carolina, have taken a similar stance as California and prohibited bitcoin donations outright.

42401919,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2v2p,1537502403,'Turbo Geth' Seeks to Scale Ethereum – And It's Already in Beta,"There's software ready to help ethereum scale – right now.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the raw architecture of Turbo Geth has been completed – and is currently available to early adopters for testing. Alexey Akhunov, the independent software developer that built the software, told CoinDesk that unlike many other scaling solutions, Turbo Geth looks at tackling ethereum's so-called state, instead of transaction congestion and costs.  The term ""state"" in this context describes the every-increasing history of all computations of the network. By rewriting Geth, the Ethereum Foundation's in-house software for interacting with the blockchain, Akhunov said, he's cut storage down to one-fifth its current size.  This approach allows ethereum nodes to run on cheaper hardware. What's more, it's something that many in the ethereum community are passionate about because less expensive hardware helps keep the network decentralized.  ""We probably can go 10x just from optimizations,"" Akhunov said on a scalability panel during the ethereum conference Dappcon in Berlin this summer.  Alluding to code improvements that could streamline ethereum – before it upgrades to scaling tech sharding – the statement was received with much applause.  It aligns with the anticipation many in the industry feel for Akhunov's work, heralded as one of ethereum's most promising scaling solutions (although one not pegged to the formal scaling roadmap).  And while there's still work to be done – Turbo Geth lacks many of the features users expect from a fully-functional client currently – Akhunov believes the software will inspire others to take similarly experimental approaches to design.  ""One of the contributions I have made is I've broadened the design space, and said 'well, what if we don't do it this way, but we do it the other way,'"" Akhunov told CoinDesk, adding:  ""My main hope is that it brings other clients and other client developers to look at the broader design space for ethereum clients.""  All about organization  Turbo Geth takes how traditional clients store information and turns the process completely on its head.  ""The main difference is the way it organizes the database that stores the state and the history of state,"" Akhunov told CoinDesk.  In essence, Turbo Geth takes what has become the dominant way of storing data in ethereum clients, called the hash tree, and replaces that structure with a highly simplified index.  For example, while the hash tree requires many steps in order to retrieve information, Turbo Geth fuses a diverse range of data – such as histories of accounts, nodes, contracts and blocks – into compact strings of information that are lighter to store and faster to retrieve.  The result is that for a full archive node – a type of ethereum node that stores the full history of the state – Turbo Geth creates substantial gains. Compared the 1.2 terabytes of disk space required by Geth today, Turbo Geth users only need 252.11 gigabytes of disk space to run a full archive node.  On top of that, because Turbo Geth vastly minimizes how information is stored at a client level, ""the database layout is much more straightforward to use when you want to just look up information from the past,"" Akhunov said.  The layout makes it much faster to retrieve information, he continued, adding:  ""Querying the storage entries at a historical point in the contract is probably about 100x faster.""  Not yet public  While these gains are notable, there's work that remains to be done before Turbo Geth is an actionable client like Geth and Parity, ethereum's second most popular software client.  In addition to lacking a user-friendly interface, Turbo Geth would take about two weeks in order to sync with the blockchain.  ""Obviously that's not acceptable for most people,"" Akhunov said.  As such, Akhunov said Turbo Geth will need to add support for a feature that cuts synchronization time by allowing clients to link up with snapshots provided by other archive nodes.  Within the Parity architecture, this is known as ""warp sync,"" and Akhunov said there might be a way to bootstrap Turbo Geth from this Parity feature.  And still, while the client is getting close to finished, Akhunov built the software entirely on his own and emphasized that he doesn't have the capacity to deal with requests from the public – meaning that Turbo Geth is strictly in private beta for now.  To build the client, Akhunov received financial support from the Ethereum Foundation and Infura, the ConsenSys-led provider of software that allows decentralized applications to interface with ethereum in a lightweight way. Moving forward, however, the developer envisions handing the Turbo Geth project over to a committed team so that he can continue his research into ethereum scalability.  ""I would try to give it into good hands,"" Akhunov told CoinDesk.  Deeper research  For Akhunov, Turbo Geth doesn't quite fulfill his vision for a fully scalable ethereum.  While the storage enhancements are substantial, he said: ""When I started working on Turbo Geth I made an assumption that the bottleneck is of the ethereum client is mostly its access to the state, which was true to a certain extent, but it's not 100 percent. I have changed my point of view slightly since then.""  For example, while Turbo Geth makes it cheaper and easier for users to run nodes, it doesn't impact scalability directly – like increasing transaction speed for example.  Going forward, then, the developer wants to dig deeper into how clients function – not just at the level of individual software, such as Geth and Parity, but how combinations of software intercommunicate.  ""In order to solve the scaling bottleneck we have to look at how clients interoperate and maybe there's incompatibility between them,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Often the slowest bit is dragging you down.""  For example, Akhunov pointed to several unsolved mysteries on the ethereum blockchain, such as quirks occurring at the mining level, where periodically, miners are producing long chains of blocks that eventually get abandoned.  As such, the developer said he'd like to dedicate his time to studying the ethereum network and observing client interoperability issues in order to better understand where the scalability bottleneck is occurring.
