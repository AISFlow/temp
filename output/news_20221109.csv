42415022,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVq6Y,1668038010,FTX Faces US Justice Department Probe: Report,"The U.S. Department of Justice is looking into crypto exchange FTX after its apparent collapse, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.  FTX was already facing probes from state and federal regulators, but these investigations have taken on a new interest following revelations that the company had a liquidity issue. Fellow crypto exchange Binance briefly agreed to acquire the company, but walked away from the deal on Wednesday. Shortly thereafter, Bankman-Fried reportedly told investors that FTX needed $8 billion to continue operating or would risk having to file for bankruptcy protection.  State regulators were previously looking into FTX and whether it allowed U.S. customers to trade derivatives products without either FTX or FTX.US, its U.S. entity, registering with federal regulators.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are also investigating whether FTX had correctly handled its clients' funds, Bloomberg reported earlier Wednesday.  Binance announced Tuesday it would acquire FTX, but said Wednesday that it would not, citing concerns about FTX's books, which is an issue investigators may look into.  ""The issues are beyond our control or ability to help,"" Binance said in a statement Wednesday. The statement also cited news reports about ""mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations"" as reasons for pulling out of the deal.  Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's founder and CEO, had also previously tweeted that his company ""is fine,"" as were its assets. The assertion was undercut a day later when Bankman-Fried and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced Binance had signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire the company.

42415017,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVplK,1668037358,DeFi Exchange Platform dYdX Places Solana in 'Close Only' Mode,"Decentralized exchange dYdX placed Solana trades in “close only” mode, meaning users will only be able to close out their positions on the perpetuals exchange and not open new ones.  DYdX cited “market volatility” as its reason for making the move. Solana’s SOL token fell precipitously today on the news that FTX, a crypto exchange that holds a major stake in Solana, has become insolvent. SOL is currently priced at $14.10, down 40% from $24 a day ago.  DYdX is a “hybrid” decentralized exchange that uses code – rather than a central intermediary – to facilitate most of its operations. The platform facilitated $3 billion worth of transactions in the past 24-hours, making it the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange by daily trading volume according to CoinMarketCap.  Decentralized exchanges exist as a response to centralized trading platforms like FTX that take full custody of user funds – a practice that is viewed by some as anathema to crypto’s founding goals around self-sovereignty and trustlessness.  Though dYdX will continue allowing users to close out their positions, the announcement that it would disallow some kinds of trades – even to protect users – led to attacks from some who believe a “decentralized” platform shouldn’t be able to curtail user activity.  DYdX is not the only trading platform that has restricted Solana trades due to the day’s high volatility and sinking prices. The centralized exchange Crypto.com halted Solana-based stablecoin deposits and withdraws earlier today, and the exchange OKX announced that it would delist Solana futures and stop listing new options.  DYdX didn’t immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.",NEGATIVE,SOL,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/09/defi-exchange-platform-dydx-places-solana-in-close-only-mode,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/130052490c19b224ca33f1e6ba3ed7ebe31418ae-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
4011990,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4555615-hive-blockchain-potentially-mining-negative-margins?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1668037352,HIVE Blockchain: Potentially Mining At Negative Margins,"Summary HIVE Blockchain is one of the largest publicly traded crypto miners with assets in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland. The Ethereum merge happened and HIVE's October BTC production is down 40% from August. At a recent $17,000/BTC, HIVE might not even be covering the cost of electricity. A few months ago, I wrote a cautious article on HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. ( HIVE ), highlighting some red flags in the company's Q4/2022 earnings report. In particular, I was worried that HIVE's Ethereum (ETH-USD) mining equipment may become obsolete with a pending transition to a ""Proof-of-Stake"" (""POS"") system. I was also worried about HIVE's mining margins, as HIVE had been mining at negative gross margins in Q4/2022. Since my article, HIVE has declined over 30%. After reviewing the latest figures from HIVE's monthly production reports and cryptocurrency prices, I continue to recommend investors stay away. At current crypto prices, HIVE appears to be mining at negative gross mining margins, i.e. not even covering the cost of electricity. The loss of Ethereum mining has dealt a heavy blow to HIVE's operations. Combined with increased Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining difficulty, HIVE's monthly production of BTC has declined 40% from August to October despite adding 7% in ASICs. Ethereum Merged And Its Impact On HIVE When I wrote my initial article, there was still quite a bit of doubt about the pending Ethereum conversion to POS. In fact, HIVE itself had been downplaying the timeline and impact, with the company making fun of the long delayed transition in their Q3/F22 presentation (Figure 1). Figure 1 - HIVE downplayed Ethereum merge (HIVE Q3/F22 Presentation) Unfortunately for HIVE and other Ethereum miners that derived revenues from Proof-of-Work on the Ethereum network, the Ethereum network successfully merged to a POS system on September 15, 2022. The merge made Ethereum mining equipment obsolete, with many GPUs now selling below MSRP and list prices. As a reminder, HIVE had 6.49 Terahash of Ethereum mining capacity at the end of August, which produced 3,010 ETH (equivalent to 228.4 BTC, according to HIVE). HIVE also mined 290.4 BTC in August, using their dedicated ASIC miners, so in total, the company produced 518.8 BTC equivalent. In response to the Ethereum Merge, HIVE commented that the company would be pivoting its business to focus on Bitcoin, including the digital treasury assets (i.e. it would no longer HODL ETH). Since the merge, HIVE revenues from GPU mining were dramatically reduced, from ~7 BTC/d to 1.6 BTC/d, as the GPUs were converted to mine alt-coins. In September, the transition month, HIVE mined 268.9 BTC from ASIC mining, 1,394 ETH (equiv. to 111.6 BTC), and 15.8 BTC from GPU mining of alt-coins for a total of 396.3 BTC. In October , the 1st month of BTC only mining, HIVE mined 262 BTC from ASIC mining and 45 BTC from GPU mining for a total of 307 BTC. So as a result of the Ethereum merge, HIVE's BTC equivalent mining production declined by over 40%, from 519 BTC in August to 307 BTC in October. Bitcoin Difficulty Continue To Climb; HIVE Running On A Treadmill Further compounding HIVE's Ethereum problem was the fact that the difficulty to mine Bitcoin continued to climb, recently pushing new all-time highs despite the fall in Bitcoin prices (Figure 2). Figure 2 - Bitcoin difficulty vs. price (blockchain.com) So even as HIVE continued to add ASIC mining rigs, with its ASIC hashrate increasing 7% from 2.23 Exahash in August to 2.38 Exahash in October, the number of BTC it mined from ASIC mining actually declined 10% from 290 BTC in August to 262 in October. What Is HIVE's Margin Now? Revisiting my concern on HIVE's margin profile, admittedly, I was too bearish in my prior article when I pointed out HIVE was mining at negative gross margin in Q4/F22, as a number of one-off expenses had inflated operating and maintenance expenses. In the first quarter results reported in August, Gross Mining Margin expanded QoQ to 61%, as operating and maintenance costs normalized somewhat to $17.2 million. However, I was directionally correct, as HIVE's Gross Margin, which included depreciation of mining equipment, was only 3% in Q1/F23 (Figure 3). Figure 3 - HIVE operating summary (HIVE Q1/F23 MD&A) Are Gross Mining Margins Now Zero? Looking forward, we are at an interesting juncture. On November 9th, Bitcoin crashed to ~$17,000 as one of the seemingly 'untouchables' of the industry, FTX, was forced to seek a bailout from its main rival, Binance . What is interesting is that, if we assume HIVE's Q1/F23's operating and maintenance costs are the norm, that works out to a daily mining cost of ~$190k ($17.2 million over 91 days). From the October production update, we also know that: As of November 2, HIVE is producing an average of over 9.5 Bitcoin per day from ASIC and GPU production, comprised of over 8 Bitcoin per day from our ASIC fleet and over 1 Bitcoin per day from our GPU fleet. Even if we are generous and assume HIVE produces 10 BTC per day, at current bitcoin prices, HIVE is only generating $170,000 / day (10 BTC times $17,000 / BTC) in revenues. Therefore, it is very possible that HIVE is currently mining at a negative gross mining margin . This would mean mining revenues cannot even cover the electricity costs. Risks To Bearish View Obviously, the biggest risk to my bearish view is going to be cryptocurrency prices. In August, following my last article, HIVE briefly topped $7/share as risk assets had a summertime rally. However, I think over the long run, HIVE cannot escape from the reality that at current crypto prices, its mining gear may be basically burning energy and money as it mines at negative gross mining margins. Summary In summary, I continue to be wary of HIVE. At current crypto prices, HIVE appears to be mining at negative gross mining margins. The loss of Ethereum mining has dealt a heavy blow to HIVE's operations. Combined with increased BTC difficulty, HIVE's monthly production of BTC has declined 40% from August to October despite adding 7% in ASICs.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4555615-hive-blockchain-potentially-mining-negative-margins?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4011990.jpeg

42415019,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVpvw,1668036130,OpenSea Makes Waves: Says Creator Royalties Will Be Enforced,"Leading non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea said Wednesday it is standing by creators and continuing to enforce royalties on the platform.  The platform shared a Twitter thread explaining its stance to continue supporting creators through mandating royalties. It shared that since Oct. 12, the average percentage of fees received by the top 20 NFT collections dropped from 77% to 56%.  “Unless something changes soon, this space is trending toward significantly fewer fees paid to creators,” said OpenSea in a tweet.  As the leading NFT marketplace in terms of trading volume, according to data from Dappradar, there’s been speculation around OpenSea’s decision: Will they continue to support creators in earning royalties on their work or nix these payment requirements? Since August, NFT marketplaces X2Y2, Magic Eden and LooksRare have altered their royalty structures, no longer obligating buyers to pay royalties or contribute to creators.  There’s also been active community pushback, urging OpenSea to clarify its stance. On Monday, 19-year old NFT artist Victor Langlois, who goes by FEWOCiOUS, wrote a letter on Twitter to OpenSea, asking the platform to stand with creators.  “Royalties were the reason the art community flocked to NFTs in the first place,” said Langlois. “[Removing royalties] is backward progress for artists and the community at large.”  Read More: Retract Royalties, Reduce Revenue: NFT Creators Are Suffering and so Are Marketplaces",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/11/09/opensea-makes-waves-says-creator-royalties-will-be-enforced,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35cdc41cf0c4d49c2cdb92b2049bcfafc1f36b86-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388710,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRRAvF,1668034785,8 Days in November: What Led to FTX’s Sudden Collapse,"The past week has seen a dizzying downward spiral for Sam Bankman-Fried’s huge crypto empire. Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange has paused withdrawals, and a tentative bailout from rival Binance appears to be kaput. That could put depositor funds at risk, and certainly spells a major setback for not only Bankman-Fried but for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.  These downfalls aren’t rare in crypto, which is subject to extreme boom-bust cycles. But FTX and Bankman-Fried are unique in the stature they achieved before self-immolating. Over the past three years, FTX has come to be widely regarded as a reputable exchange, despite not submitting to U.S. regulation. Bankman-Fried has himself become globally influential, thanks to his thoughts on cryptocurrency regulation and his financial support for U.S. electoral candidates – not necessarily in that order.  These narratives about both FTX and Bankman-Fried are now clearly dead in the water, given recent evidence that everything was not as it seemed at the exchange, or at Bankman-Fried’s other firm, Alameda Research.  The questions to answer in the coming days will be: What happened? And why did almost nobody see it coming?  What follows is the most important context for understanding this ongoing story. That includes the sudden crisis of confidence driven by revelations about Sam Bankman-Fried’s accounting practices; the added shock of the unwind thanks to Bankman-Fried’s golden-boy reputation; and the complex role of competitor Binance and its founder, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, in the crisis.  A 'liquidity crunch' implies undisclosed risk  Facts first uncovered by CoinDesk played a major role in the events of the past week. On Nov. 2, reporter Ian Allison published findings that roughly $5.8 billion out of $14.6 billion of assets on the balance sheet at Alameda Research, based on then-current valuations, were linked to FTX’s exchange token, FTT.  This finding, based on leaked internal documents, was explosive because of the very close relationship between Alameda and FTX. Both were founded by Bankman-Fried, and there has been significant anxiety about the extent and nature of their fraternal dealings. The FTT token was essentially created from thin air by FTX, inviting questions about the real-world, open-market value of FTT tokens held in reserve by affiliated entities.  Negative speculation about a financial institution can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, triggering withdrawals out of a sense of uncertainty and leading to the very liquidity problems that were feared. Since publication of Allison’s initial story, CoinDesk reporters have been advised to practice extreme caution and diligence in reporting about FTT and other matters at Alameda and FTX.  But sometimes straightforward facts are enough to trigger an entirely justified bank run. Seemingly because of their known close ties, worries about Alameda’s balance sheet translated into a rapidly accelerating mass exodus from FTX. The exchange saw $6 billion in withdrawals in the 72 hours before things reached a head on the morning of Nov. 8, according to internal messages seen by Reuters.  According to Coinglass data, that for a time left FTX with a balance of, unbelievably, just one bitcoin. That has now rebounded to 36 BTC, compared to more than half a million BTC each held by Coinbase and Binance.  Read More: FTX Balances Tumbled 87% in 5 Days in Epic Crypto Deposit Run, Data Shows  This rush to the exits reportedly led Bankman-Fried and his team to begin frantically shopping for an acquisition partner, approaching a variety of potential partners before Binance entered the picture.  It remains worryingly unclear, though, exactly why even such a dramatic rush for the exits would have led FTX to seek its own bailout. The exchange promised users that it would not speculate with cryptocurrencies held in their accounts. But if that policy was followed, there should have been no pause to withdrawals, nor any balance sheet gap to fill. One possible explanation comes from Coinmetrics analyst Lucas Nuzzi, who has presented what he says is evidence that FTX transferred funds to Alameda in September, perhaps as a loan to backstop Alameda’s losses.  The crisis also seemed to validate anxieties about what Alameda’s immense holdings of FTT-linked assets meant for the stability of Bankman-Fried’s empire. The market value of the token is down more than 80% over the past week.  Late in the day on Nov. 8, after the announcement of a tentative deal with Binance, FTX said it had officially suspended all crypto withdrawals.  JP No Mor-gan  As striking as the numbers are, the greater significance of FTX’s collapse may be in how it upends a long-running narrative about SBF himself. As apparent frauds like Terra and Celsius unwound in the first half of 2022, triggering contagion across other crypto entities, Bankman-Fried was often seen both as a sane and sober counterpoint, and as a well-resourced backstop ready to rescue the entire ecosystem.  Bankman-Fried’s endeavors included loans to or moves to acquire faltering crypto lender BlockFi, lender Voyager Digital and Anthony Scarammucci’s Skybridge Capital hedge fund. Alameda Research also led a funding round for the Facebook-linked Aptos blockchain in late July, at a time when investment funds were drying up.  In his role as a funder of last resort, Bankman-Fried was frequently described, including by CoinDesk, as “the J.P. Morgan of crypto” – referring not to the Jamie Dimon-run investment bank, but to its robber-baron founder. Twice around the turn of the 19th century, in 1893 and 1907, Morgan stepped in to support emerging financial markets through a crisis with his own funds.  But there have been increasing signs that this framing was, at best, oversimplified. Bankman-Fried teased many more deals than actually went through, for instance backing out after a tentative move to acquire Celsius. Many of these deals arguably flowed money back to FTX or Alameda. And some of the headline numbers may have exaggerated exactly how much real money was on the line.  All of this is particularly relevant because of the profile Bankman-Fried has worked to build as a political influencer, both on general policy and crypto regulation specifically. Though the precise connection to this week’s crisis is a bit opaque, Bankman-Fried faced a wave of blowback in late October over a series of crypto regulation proposals. He was also a major donor to the U.S. Democratic Party.  By one preliminary estimate, this week’s disaster means Bankman-Fried is no longer a billionaire personally. That doesn’t entirely preclude future political influence via donations, but it will certainly constrain him. More significant is that Bankman-Fried’s credibility as a policy advisor, on finance or anything else, has been left in tatters – a washout for his “effective altruism” agenda.  Frenemies: SBF and CZ  Easily the most fascinating element of the current debacle is the role of Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, founder and head of Binance, the world’s largest centralized crypto exchange by volume. CZ and Bankman-Fried have been occasional collaborators over the past few years, but recent interactions have suggested rising interpersonal and business tension.  Zhao and Binance also materially contributed to FTX’s meltdown – though it’s unclear whether that was his intent. Apparently in reaction to CoinDesk’s reporting about the predominance of FTT on Alameda’s balance sheet, Zhao on Nov. 6 announced that Binance would liquidate a large remaining balance of FTT tokens distributed to it as part of a prior sell-off of FTX equity.  In a truly bizarre move, Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison quickly and very publicly offered Zhao an over-the-counter deal to buy the tokens at $22 each. That’s confounding both because the public offer seemed to expose anxiety within Alameda about the market impact of Binance’s sale, and because Ellison’s offer was slightly below FTT’s public exchange price at the time – not exactly much incentive to help Alameda out.  Zhao initially framed Binance’s sell-off as benignly as possible, insisting, “Regarding any speculation as to whether this is a move against a competitor, it is not.”  But later the same day, Zhao muddied that claim with a more barbed statement.  “Liquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA,” he wrote. “We gave support before, but we won't pretend to make love after divorce. We are not against anyone. But we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. Onwards.”  The comparison to LUNA is particularly venomous, given that its creator, Do Kwon, is currently an international fugitive evading charges of financial fraud in South Korea. Zhao’s allusion to lobbying efforts also give the impression that there’s something personal at play here.  Zhao may have taken a dim view of a since-deleted tweet by Bankman-Fried that seemed to cast aspersions on Zhao’s Chinese ancestry. Zhao is Canadian, and has for many years bridled at suggestions that Binance is a Chinese firm.  All of this has led to speculation that Zhao has been playing four-dimensional chess against Bankman-Fried and FTX. Zhao himself later described his announcement of a large FTT sale as “the straw that broke the camel’s back,” undermining confidence in FTX at a key moment. Zhao has denied ill intent or calculation, but this was hard to credit as of Nov. 8, with Binance poised to acquire a competitor after making moves that seriously weakened it.  Then came more CoinDesk reporting Wednesday morning, since confirmed by other outlets, that Binance would likely back out of the deal after a preliminary examination of FTX’s finances. It may be some time until we fully understand exactly what Zhao saw when he got a peek behind the curtain – but it’s probably nothing good.",NEGATIVE,BTC | FTT,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB | FTT,David Z.

42388711,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRRB4b,1668034107,A Failed FTX-Binance Deal Is ‘Catastrophic’ for Crypto Sector,"Betting on Sam Bankman-Fried, the once-beloved poster boy and “white knight” of crypto, was supposed to be safe. But recent events have shown that’s far from the truth.  Following on the heels of the Terra ecosystem collapse, the Celsius Network insolvency and the Three Arrows Capital blow up, the crypto industry fell into even greater turmoil this week after SBF’s FTX crypto exchange was forced to seek a bailout amid liquidity issues.  While a non-binding deal with competitor Binance stemmed the panic for a short time Tuesday, things took an even darker turn after CoinDesk on Wednesday morning reported that Binance was highly unlikely to go through with its proposed acquisition. By late Wednesday afternoon, Binance itself confirmed that the deal is off, sending crypto markets plunging even further. Bitcoin (BTC) sank below $16,000 for the first time in two years.  Unless another buyer is waiting in the wings, Binance’s exit from the acquisition likely seals the fate for FTX and, with that, trust in the crypto industry will further decline from both retail and institutional investors.  “A lot of normal users will lose their money, so this will be catastrophic for the ecosystem in the short term,” said Jay Jog, co-founder of layer 1 blockchain Sei Network. “There will be degraded confidence in crypto in the short term, both from an institutional standpoint and from a retail standpoint,” he added.  That sentiment was echoed by SmartBlocks founder Mark Fidelman, who told CoinDesk, “If the deal between FTX and Binance doesn't happen, we'll need to see another major player step in like Coinbase to bail them out.

42388719,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRRBu3,1668032191,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin, Other Cryptos Continue to Plummet","Price Action  Crypto markets’ misery seemed boundless on Tuesday amid the ongoing fallout from crypto exchange FTX’s distress.  BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading at about $16,300, a more than 10% decline to its lowest level in two years. Bitcoin has been swept up in the cryptocurrency industry’s latest crisis, FTX’s liquidity issues, a mass exodus from the exchange and proposed sale to rival Binance that collapsed. On Wednesday, CoinDesk reported that Binance was highly unlikely to follow through on its non-binding letter of intent after reviewing FTX’s internal data and loan commitments. The story was later confirmed to CoinDesk.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  ""This is another one of those catalysts,"" said Bob Iaccino, Path Trading Partners co-founder and chief market strategist. ""I wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin went as low as $9,000, which for me, as someone who got out of bitcoin and is waiting to get in again, would actually be a positive.""  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,150, off roughly 12% to its lowest level since July. Other major cryptocurrencies continued to plunge for a third consecutive day as investors fretted over every development in an industry already rocking from calamities involving crypto giants Terraform Labs, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius Network.  FTX’s FTT token had recently dropped almost 50% a day after plummeting about 80% and was trading at just $2.62. The Solana platform’s SOL token had recently fallen more than 45% to continue its downward momentum of recent days. Last week, CoinDesk reported that a copy of FTX sister company Alameda's balance sheet showed the firm held $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.” Even Binance’s BNB token was down about 15% after outperforming most other cryptos on Tuesday.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was down 8%.  A day after U.S. midterm elections, stocks saw their first red of the week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropping 2.4% and 2%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was off 1.9%. Safe haven gold ticked down slightly.  In an email, Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote that the FTX debacle and its much-admired CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, has shaken an industry often criticized for its lack of guardrails.  “Sam Bankman-Fried was supposed to be bulletproof,” Moya wrote. “SBF was crypto’s ‘White Knight’ and the implosion of FTX means no one is safe. The stabilization period for crypto is over and now we wait to see if other contagion risks emerge.”  Latest Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 809.33 −106.4 ▼ 11.6% Bitcoin (BTC) $15,925 −2684.8 ▼ 14.4% Ethereum (ETH) $1,118 −217.8 ▼ 16.3% S&P 500 daily close  3,748.57 −79.5 ▼ 2.1% Gold  $1,709 −3.0 ▼ 0.2% Treasury Yield 10 Years  4.15% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Technical Take  These Four Key Charts Shed Light on the FTX Exchange's Spectacular Collapse  By Sage D. Young  Stablecoins  Understanding the volatility stemming from the FTX drama continues with stablecoin outflows. According to Nansen data, in the past seven days starting on Monday, Nov. 7, FTX led all exchanges in stablecoin outflows. Some $451 million worth of stablecoins have left FTX, more than the combined outflows of KuCoin, Crypto.com and OKX.  Specifically, FTX’s holdings of USDC and USDT have nosedived dramatically. Between Friday, Nov. 4, and Tuesday, Nov. 8, Nansen data shows FTX’s USDC holdings dropped about $137 million, roughly 84%, while its USDT holdings dropped from $198 million to $68 million.  According to CryptoQuant, FTX’s stablecoin reserve stands at roughly $156 million currently, down more than 78% since Oct. 24.  Read the full technical take here.

""If the non-FTX exchange is also a client of SI's then the transfer would occur over (SI's) SEN"" network, he said.

The 92-NFT collection features 31 rare ones from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection and 26 Otherdeed for Otherside tokens, both created by NFT powerhouse Yuga Labs.  FTX Ventures, the $2 billion VC wing of the crypto empire, was a prominent investor in Yuga Labs’ $450 million funding round last March. A representative of the firm says that FTX's financial sibling Alameda Research is in charge of the wallet, and has previously traded Bored Apes as part of its NFT trading strategy.  The collection has an estimated value of between 4,000 and 5,000 ETH (or roughly $4.7 million to $5.8 million), according to Nikolai Yakovenko, the founder of NFT valuation site DeepNFTValue. That’s likely far from enough to prop up FTX, though, given how big it is and how badly wounded it seems to be.

No NFTs from that fund have so far been auctioned, though the entire collection was moved to a safehouse wallet in October.  Among the Alameda wallet’s rarest collectibles are three Bored Apes with gold fur, a trait with a floor price of 1,000 ETH. The last gold fur Bored Ape sold for 800 ETH, though in the event of liquidation, Yakovenko estimates each of the gold fur NFTs would fetch around 500 ETH given current market conditions.  The collection also has four “trippy fur” Bored Apes, a trait that currently sports a 599 ETH floor, according to OpenSea.

But considering the price action and sentiment out there, it is challenging to consider any bullish thesis. Bitcoin price is now at the 0.5 retracement using Fibonacci on log settings. But that isn’t very reassuring. Given the expectations for the $14K and $13K area, either Bitcoin price action stops short of that level, or slices right through it.

This is notable, because during the 2018 bear market, BTC fell by 84%, and in the 2015 bear market it dropped 86%. If you average out those two samples, you get an 85% retracement on average.

42388713,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRRBDx,1668029636,"With FTX Bloodied, Rival in US Regulatory Fight Adds Another Knife","An old-guard rival of FTX from the derivatives markets sought to drive a stake through its heart as the crypto company struggled to save itself from financial disaster on Wednesday.  A subsidiary of Cboe Global Markets Inc. sent a letter on Wednesday to its customers – addressed as the “crypto community” – reminding them of its own “customer protection policies, the benefits of regulatory oversight and the value of including intermediaries in our marketplace.”  “Cboe Digital has strict policies in place to ensure our customer funds are segregated and safe,” said the note from Cboe Digital President John Palmer.  The comment about intermediaries goes to the heart of what FTX has applied to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to be allowed to do. FTX US Derivatives is seeking approval to eliminate go-betweens by handling the clearing of crypto transactions directly for customers – an idea the industry has generally criticized as dangerous.  Palmer explained his timing in a statement to CoinDesk, saying, ""Recent market events are a testament to the value of these tenets upon which we’ve built our platform.""  Sam Bankman-Fried appeared at a CFTC roundtable earlier this year to tout his idea for using technology to do things a new way, which has drawn some tentative praise from CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam as a potentially evolutionary innovation.  Bankman-Fried said his FTX US remains separate from the negotiations over the purchase of FTX’s non-U.S. assets, which ended Wednesday after Binance said it was walking away from the deal. The derivatives subsidiary is in that U.S. arm. But the situation is already casting a shadow over the CFTC application, and the status of the U.S. operations remains unclear. CFTC spokesperson Steven Adamske previously told CoinDesk that it’s awaiting any new information from FTX.  Cboe Global Markets Inc., which acquired ErisX earlier this year and entered the digital-assets space as Cboe Digital, has formally opposed FTX’s proposal in a letter to the agency that argued that something this important should be done in a new rule instead of an application process.  “Enabling access via intermediaries ensures that there are multiple points of risk and credit control, customer protection, separation of business function/duty, and management of conflicts of interest,” the company said in its letter this week.

Binance Walks Away, Crypto Industry In The Dark Before the official announcement, there was much speculation about Binance pulling out of the deal because of potential legal consequences. The company claims it was trying to protect crypto investors. Thousands of users report that their funds remain stuck on FTX. The crypto exchange halted new withdrawal requests yesterday due to a “liquidity crunch.” Binance was allegedly trying to fill this hole by acquiring the company and to provide liquidity for the users. However, the situation went “beyond our control or ability to help,” the company claimed while adding: Every time a major player in an industry fails, retail consumers will suffer. We have seen over the last several years that the crypto ecosystem is becoming more resilient and we believe in time that outliers that misuse user funds will be weeded out by the free market.

42394108,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXlnL,1668029260,The Downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX: The Industry Reacts,"The rise and fall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange has already had a profound impact on the industry. Bankman-Fried is among the most influential political dealers in crypto, and so regulators and politicians will likely notice that the exchange he built has collapsed.  That FTX may (or may not) be bought by Binance, its largest rival and earliest backer, is significant. While Binance has made serious steps towards transparency in recent years, it is also a stand-in for crypto’s seeming intransigence.  No one knows, for instance, where Binance is officially located or how wealthy is its founder, Changpeng Zhao. If Binance acquires FTX – preventing a bank run that it helped foment – questions will be raised. Regulators are already hyper-sensitive to monopolistic behavior in tech, and wasn’t crypto supposed to provide an alternative model?  If there is one lesson from this ongoing crisis, it’s the need for transparency. The irony that Bankman-Fried has advocated for reducing financial privacy and abstruse licensing models for crypto should not be lost – SBF’s Alameda Research and FTX were tied up in dangerous, unsustainable ways the world is only beginning to understand.  See also: The Story of Sam Bankman-Fried's Backroom Deal With Binance  This is a “dynamic situation,” to steal Zhao’s phrase, and can change by the hour. CoinDesk reached out to a number of regulatory, financial and technological experts for their take on what it all means. In short, whatever happens, the effects will be wide-reaching.  The Blockchain Association’s Kristin Smith discusses conversations likely happening on Capitol Hill while former New York State Department of Financial Services regulator Matt Homer breaks down the challenges of global enforcement. Others examine using zero-knowledge proofs to show exchanges are solvent, while some others discuss buying opportunities.  Foreign buyouts  The ultimate meltdown of the internet market [around] 2001 demonstrated a lot of the interconnections that you might not have predicted, which may be at play here in the possible merger. … Whenever there's a question of Chinese investment in a technologically innovative business, a lot of antennas go up. On the one hand, there's no question the Biden administration has been much more aggressive about antitrust enforcement than we've seen. We saw this with the rejection of Penguin Simon Schuster publishing deal.  [Crypto] is such an immature market that I don't know what the conversations might be inside the FTC [Federal Trading Commission] or inside the Department of Justice. I don’t know how traditional antitrust actors would think about a market that is this volatile [and] that is changing this rapidly.  – U.S. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), on CoinDesk TV  The Congress conversation  It's important to remember that Binance.US and FTX.US are not part of this deal. So U.S. retail customers should not at least, at this stage, be caught up in the deal that is being negotiated.  That being said, lawmakers are very much paying attention to this because Sam [Bankman-Fried] has spent a lot of time in Washington, D.C., and does personally know a lot of the policymakers. And so it’s going to invite a lot of scrutiny into how centralized exchanges should be regulated. It’s interesting, because what happened with FTX may not be able to be addressed by U.S. regulation.  Congress is very interested, as we've seen this past year, in finding a way to regulate the spot markets and exchanges registered with the CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] and potentially the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission]. Part of that could mean having some sort of proof of reserves and guidelines around what you're supposed to do with customer deposits.  There’s an expectation with crypto customers when they're keeping their crypto on exchanges that it’s not being taken and lent out and doing something else, like it would be with a bank. This is going to open up a more robust debate around exchange regulation.  – Kristin Smith, executive director of Blockchain Association, on CoinDesk TV  Regulatory questions  While the FTX story is still unfolding, one of the most important lessons we might eventually take from it is that prudential regulation and supervision matters. Let’s break that down. Regulation means rules and requirements. Supervision means ongoing oversight through means such as examinations and reporting. And prudential means safety and soundness, or financial condition.  In contrast to conduct regulators, who care primarily about how you conduct yourself in the marketplace (Are you providing appropriate disclosures? Are you treating customers fairly? etc.), prudential regulators are concerned with the financial health of your company (Are you solvent? Do you have sufficient capital reserves? How susceptible are you to market contagion?).  This type of regulation is especially needed for opaque market actors. And if there’s one thing we’ve learned several times over this year it’s that the centralized crypto players are a pretty opaque bunch. And they’re global, making the web of lines connecting them to each other difficult to determine.  See also: Does the US Government Have a Monopoly on Trust? | Matt Homer  It turns out that for these types of centralized actors having a regulator examine their books and set capital requirements that are commensurate with the risks posed is pretty important. While there’s a lot of talk over which conduct regulator in Washington, D.C., should rule the roost, it seems we’ve forgotten about a more foundational element of regulation and supervision: ensuring a company is financially sound.  – Matt Homer, venture capitalist, crypto adviser and former NYDFS regulator  Discount what SBF has said  It's incredible how quickly these things can spiral out of control. FTX was the crypto giant offering to acquire the assets of bankrupt crypto platforms (like Voyager Digital) and signing loans to other entities (BlockFi) not that long ago, and now they're sinking.  It was hard not to notice how [Binance CEO] CZ really seemed to be hedging things in his tweets:  ""we signed a non-binding LOI, intending to fully acquire FTX.""  ""we will be conducting a full DD in the coming days.""  ""This is a highly dynamic situation, and we are assessing the situation in real time. Binance has the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time.""  I'm giving it decent odds that the deal doesn't go through, or that Binance threatens to pull out if they're not given very friendly terms. It's remarkable, again and again, how crypto personalities like SBF will claim that everything is fine up until the very second they have to admit it isn't. I think it's because so much of crypto is dependent on the belief that things are going well – as evidenced by the fact that FTX was floating along for quite some time with this overinflated balance sheet until it suddenly became apparent to the public that things were not OK behind the scenes.  Sam's last tweet before the acquisition deal announcement was him saying ""A competitor [Binance] is trying to go after us with false rumors. FTX is fine. Assets are fine."" It's all very reminiscent of Do Kwon's tweets as Terra was collapsing all around him. ""So, is this $UST depeg in the room with us right now?"" ""Deploying more capital - steady lads""  I'm curious what will happen to Alameda, which as far as I can tell is not included in the Binance deal. They are almost certainly in trouble, and the cascading effects from [the hedge fund’s] insolvency could be massive. I am also curious what effect this will have on crypto legislation. SBF has spent a lot of time in D.C. schmoozing with lawmakers and giving recommendations on possible crypto regulation, acting as the ""adult in the room"" and the liaison from the crypto industry.  If I was those legislators, I would be questioning a lot of his suggestions after seeing what was happening behind the scenes at FTX that whole time, and it would be another blow to my trust of the crypto industry to see a prominent member of it that I potentially trusted had been on such shaky ground.  – Molly White, crypto skeptic, founder of Web3 Is Going Just Great  Crypto cronyism  Perhaps it’s time we take seriously the blatant and obvious conflicts of interest that dominate the cryptocurrency industry.  – Bennett Tomlin, co-host of the “Crypto Critics' Corner” podcast  Privacy-preserving proof of reserves  Exchanges not adequately safeguarding customer’s deposits has been a recurring theme within crypto. From the early days of Mt. Gox to the recent troubles of FTX (and innumerable events in between), hacks and thefts have occurred leaving consumers holding empty bags.  Transparency and openness have always been the key to operating an exchange. While many exchanges have started the process of providing on-chain proof of reserves, such proofs alone cannot completely solve the problem as exchanges may not necessarily disclose to the public the balances of all their clients.  Even if exchanges redacted private customer information and displayed account balances publicly or, better yet, used secure computing techniques to conceal their clients’ data but proved the sum of the balances, the skeptic could rightfully say an exchange may not be including all information. This scenario reflects the adage of “garbage-in, garbage-out.”  – Matthew Niemerg, co-founder at Aleph Zero  On self-custody  Cases like this further emphasize the need for self custody and infrastructure that is built to support decentralization. The near-collapse of FTX also highlights the urgency to hold centralized entities, like [centralized exchanges], accountable for any damage done in such instances.That’s because they’re failing to deliver under its promise to safeguard users' funds. In [decentralized finance] this problem is solved by code. We have self-custody to make sure users aren’t vulnerable when those in charge are being reckless.  – Paulina Jóśków, head of business development at Ramp  Don’t conflate DeFi with CeFi  One of the main reasons we have regulation is to prevent people from being defrauded before it happens. Without regulation, we’d have to rely solely on deterrence by after-the-fact civil and criminal litigation. One inherent problem with this prevention approach, though, is that it’s an enormous amount of work! In the extreme, it’s obviously impossible for an agency to check everything and everyone.  The people most likely to mislead the public are also the most likely to mislead regulators, so a dynamic is created wherein do-gooders bear an increasing regulatory burden while the actual targets of regulation simply lie about adhering to the same regulations.  No doubt, FTX is going to increase regulatory scrutiny of crypto. That’s sad, because the best form of prevention is transparency to the public. Crowdsourcing audits is inherently more scalable than a centralized review, and thus decentralized finance (DeFi) is a long-term answer to this core problem of regulation.  Hopefully, regulators will avoid conflating DeFi crypto with CeFi crypto so they don’t hamstring the solution to the very problem they are trying to solve.  – Mark Lurie, CEO of Shipyard Software  Never use your own token for collateral  The last year has taught the crypto industry, and those investing in it, some harsh lessons about the future of digital currencies – FTX’s troubles only underline them further.  Firstly, never use a token you created as collateral, as FTX, Celsius Network and [Terra] all did. If you create a token, you have to have the cash available behind it for withdrawals. Tether is continually being asked about the assets backing [its stablecoin]. Relatively recently, USDT had 17% of its token redeemed – the cash has to be there instantly.  Secondly, we heard a lot in the run-up to these events about “using capital efficiently.” The liquidity pressures that ultimately led to the situations at these brokers and lenders means all crypto businesses should have large reserves to draw on and certainly shouldn’t rely on borrowing to fund themselves.  Binance’s acquisition of FTX marks a fulcrum for the digital asset industry. This acquisition may have prevented a black swan event, but will it help the industry in the long term? Consolidation of exchanges may be necessary but, as ever, fewer players means less competition.  See also: Why Is Crypto Tanking: The FTX-Binance Drama Explained  Markets have obviously dropped significantly on the back of the news about FTX, but that was to be expected. You wouldn’t rule out further bad news to come. Subsequently, I expect there to be further falls in the value of BTC and ETH, as there will be massive losses from this latest debacle.  – Temple Melville, CEO of Scotcoin  Another great financial crisis  I’ll be very happy to see Binance help individual customers avoid losing out from the hubris and bad decisions made by another centralized exchange that positioned itself as a sensible and trustworthy operator.  However, this, like the financial crisis of 2008, demonstrates the need for transparency to ensure that participants in the financial system can make decisions with their eyes open, and for self-custody to ensure that no person or company has to place their assets at risk in order to access financial products and services.  That is the promise and benefit of DeFi, and the reason that DeFi will succeed over the long term.  – Barney Mannerings, co-founder of Vega Protocol  When ‘off-chain activity’ becomes public  The FTX/Binance situation highlights the risks of poor disclosure. When “off-chain activities” unexpectedly become public, market participants will be shocked. In other financial markets, intermediaries entrusted with client assets are required to regularly file statements of financial condition, which clarify to customers and counterparties the risks they are assuming when transacting with that party.  In DeFi protocols, these requirements are primarily satisfied by the protocols' in-built transparency. Potential users of these protocols can compare protocol transparency and make informed choices. We believe that eventually, intermediaries such as exchanges, brokers and over-the-counter trading providers will use visibility into their financial condition as a competitive differentiator, independent of any regulatory action or requirement.  – Dan Hoover, director at Castle Funds  The deal is not a win for Binance  It's highly unlikely that Binance will eventually succeed in acquiring FTX. It looks like CZ had a complete victory, but Binance will eventually pay the price for damaging the long-term interests of the industry. The joint statement tells us one fact: FTX has serious liquidity problems or even insolvency, so serious that it can no longer find people willing to save it, and can only turn to the opponents who started this war.  Why would Binance spend money to acquire it? FTX doesn't have a U.S. license (so it's nonsense to acquire FTX to get a regulatory advantage). Acquiring its users or the tech system? Huh. FTX is dead, and its users will naturally choose to go to Binance regardless.  Acquiring FTX isn't a valuable trade, and CZ's goal is already achieved. Even if Binance buys FTX, it's damaging to the industry and a humiliation to decentralization. For Binance, it might be a short term victory written into a case study, but will backfire Binance in the long term.  – Gracy Chen, managing director of Bitget  How to ensure long-term stability  Liquidity and access to capital is the foundation of a financial ecosystem. Every investor and every innovator who is banking on cryptocurrencies needs to feel secure that there are trustworthy on and off-ramps. We are encouraged by this preemptive move by two titans in the industry to ensure ongoing stability for further, stable innovation.  – Anna Becker, CEO of EndoTech  Another point for Bitcoin  FTX’s overnight implosion and subsequent forced acquisition by Binance highlights the danger of highly centralized, opaque operations that continue to govern the crypto ecosystem.  Crypto has the potential to change the world in a positive way but will only be able to unlock its full potential to give everyone in the world access to secure digital money once crypto companies start to consistently uphold strong, transparent business practices. Centralized companies like FTX that have tied their fortunes to coins without proven value will ultimately only wrong their consumers and disadvantage themselves.  Bitcoin was created to serve as a secure, independent store of value that is not reliant on any one centralized power. Bitcoin thereby solves the problems that countless companies like FTX continue to encounter by relying on their own tokens. We will continue to see this effect in crypto until companies recognize that they cannot secure their or their clients’ wealth in centralized assets that are ultimately baseless stores of value.  – Alex Adelman, CEO of Lolli  The competitive effect  A deal between Binance and FTX may strengthen the monopoly of certain trading platforms. At the same time, the importance of checking exchange reserves is also clearly being emphasized – this will be a top-of-mind topic at least in the nearest month.

It's unclear what the motive is for the token movements, and the amount is likely just a fraction of the firm's holdings; prior to the recent crypto markets crash, in June, its balance sheet included at least $14.6 billion of assets.  But the observation of the withdrawal – visible in transaction data on the Ethereum blockchain – offers a glimpse of a troubled company scrambling behind the scenes to arrange its finances. Crypto market analysts have speculated that the trading firm might be searching for liquidity while trying to satisfy demands from creditors.  Based on Ethereum blockchain data from the crypto intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence, a wallet associated with Alameda withdrew 2,262 wBTC in four separate transactions within minutes from crypto exchange FTX.US.  Later, it sent 3,000 wBTC tokens, worth of $50 million, to an address labeled as ""Wrapped Bitcoin: Controller.""  The trading volume on FTX.US for WBTC has been about $10,000 in the past 24 hours, meaning that there is no market depth on the exchange if someone would sell large amount of the token.  A spokesperson of FTX.US declined to comment. Alameda did not immediately respond to an inquiry.  FTX.US is a U.S.-based entity for American users, separate from the crypto exchange FTX but still part of the erstwhile billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire.  FTX halted user withdrawals on Tuesday after users rush to pull their cryptocurrencies out.

The StarkNet Foundation made its official debut on Wednesday with a token allocation and a seven-person board.  The StarkNet Foundation aims to help the network reach its decentralization goal through the development of governance mechanisms and the institution of decentralization technology called sequencing and proving, according to a draft blog post provided to CoinDesk.  StarkNet is a layer 2 zero-knowledge (zk) rollup that seek to address Ethereum's dual scalability issues of slow transaction speeds and high transaction fees, while maintaining the security and decentralization of the main blockchain. Parent StarkWare reached an $8 billion valuation during a $100 million funding round in May.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  The StarkNet Foundation will launch with 5.01 billion StarkNet Tokens, which amounts to 50.1% of the initial token supply of 10 billion tokens. The funds will go toward the maintenance and security of StarkNet as a public good, continued development and expansion of the network, and developer support.  The foundation’s board includes StarkWare co-founders Uri Kolodny (CEO) and Eli Ben-Sasson (president), and Shubhangi Saraf, a mathematician and computer scientist who serves as a StarkWare adviser. Other board members include lawyer and OSS Capital partner Heather Meeker, Ethereum core developer and startup founder Tomasz Stańczak, former U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer Andrew McLaughlin, and Eric Wall, a prominent crypto personality and investor.

The elections did not lead to a Republican sweep , as the party looked set to gain control of the House, but the race for Congress was yet to be determined. The uncertainty reflected in the stock market as all three averages opened lower to start Wednesday's trading session. ""Market indices dropped across the board, with the Nasdaq leading the way. There seems to be some uncertainty stemming from the midterm elections and who will ultimately control Congress. It's highly likely that Republicans will take control of the House.

The news sent crypto markets into a tailspin , with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) slipping below $17K and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) falling 10%. ""Political instability aside, the market seems to be on shaky ground for multiple reasons, including concerns over inflation data that will be reported tomorrow and with the decline in alternative assets like cryptocurrency made worse over liquidity concerns regarding FTX,"" Jones said. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP.IND ) ended 2.48% lower at 10,353.18 points. The benchmark S&P 500 ( SP500 ) retreated 2.08% to close at 3,748.57 points. The blue-chip Dow ( DJI ) fell 1.95% to end at 32,513.94 points. All 11 S&P sectors declined, with energy stocks falling the most on the uncertain election results, a jump in COVID cases in China and a criticism by the International Energy Agency of last month's OPEC+ oil cut. Heavyweight sectors Consumer Discretionary and Technology fell over 3% and 2%, respectively. Market participants are turning their attention from the election to the CPI report due Thursday. Inflation has been one of the sticking points of President Biden's administration with voters. Economists are expecting for a rise of about 0.6% in headline CPI for October, bringing the Y/Y rate down to 8%. ""Inflation data will...set the stage for what happens with interest rates next and, ultimately, that will go a long way toward dictating the near-term trajectory of the market and the economy,"" Jones added. Truist's co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner believes that the midterm elections won't significantly alter the current economic and market trajectory. ""Investors need to look well beyond the political makeup to gauge markets' risk/reward. Factors, such as the business cycle, monetary policy, and fundamentals will have a larger impact on the market’s near-term direction,"" Lerner said in a research note. In earnings related news, a disappointing quarterly report sent shares of Disney tumbling more than 13% . The entertainment giant was the top S&P and Dow percentage loser.

42420789,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYH1h,1668026398,Why Is Crypto Tanking: The FTX-Binance Drama Explained,"Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by volume, said Tuesday it would purchase FTX, effectively bailing out its main competitor and marking one of the most shocking turns of events in the history of crypto to date.  Late Wednesday, Binance reversed course, saying the issues at FTX were ""beyond our control or ability to help.""  Although the Binance-FTX takeover deal collapsed, the spectacle around it crowned the founder and CEO of Binance, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, as a kind of crypto king – solidifying his reputation as a brilliant tactician but raising concerns that he might be amassing a disproportionate amount of power in the “decentralized” world of cryptocurrency.  On the other hand, the events severely tainted the reputation and fortunes of Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old altruist investor who was, until recently, considered a kind of crypto wunderkind and destined to profit as handsomely as anyone from the sector’s meteoric rise. According to Bloomberg’s billionaire index, the FTX blowup torpedoed SBF’s net worth by 94%, from $16 billion to below $1 billion.  But Tuesday’s story was more than a spat between two billionaires with initials for nicknames.  The events sparked turmoil across the wider cryptocurrency markets – plunging bitcoin and other currencies to two-year lows. The token for Solana (SOL), a popular competitor to the Ethereum blockchain in which FTX held a major stake, was one of the biggest losers – falling nearly 50% on Wednesday, and down 93% from its 2021 high.  Though FTX’s implosion says nothing about the core technology behind crypto, it will erode trust in the industry and strike ire among regulators eager to tame it.  Confused? You’re not alone. Let’s break down what happened.  TL;DR  Leaked documents last week from CoinDesk, and the market’s reaction to what they contained, pulled the mask off SBF to show that his crypto exchange firm FTX – like so many failed exchanges before it – was at risk of insolvency.  The events revealed the FTX exchange – which allows users to buy and sell crypto – may not have been backing user funds 1:1 behind the scenes.  A bank run – instigated in large part by tweets from CZ – seized on this apparent vulnerability in the SBF empire, driving SBF’s crown jewel into the hands of its main competitor for a possible bailout.  With the deal now apparently not going through, investors are left unsure if they’ll be able to recover their funds.  The FTX bust  Documents uncovered last week by CoinDesk showed that Alameda Research – a trading and investment juggernaut founded by SBF – had its finances deeply intertwined with those of FTX.  FTX was supposed to be a separate company from Alameda, but Alameda apparently held a disproportionate amount of its balance sheet in FTX’s exchange token, FTT. That token was illiquid, with Alameda and FTX owning a vast majority of all of the tokens in circulation. Selling them would have meant crashing the price of FTT, meaning their value on Alameda’s balance sheet was likely overstated.  When documents showed that Alameda had been borrowing millions of dollars against FTT, rumors spread across Twitter that FTX was loaning out user funds to Alameda and using its own illiquid FTT token as collateral – essentially printing money so it could lend user funds to itself.  These rumors are far from confirmed, but they were the first inkling for many that deposits in the FTX exchange were not as safe as hoped.  CZ seized on this skepticism in his tweets, stating that Binance would be unwinding its own position in the FTT token over the span of a few months (In another odd footnote to this story, Binance was one of FTX’s largest early investors, meaning it had a huge number of FTT tokens and plenty of power to sway its price).  When CZ announced that he would be dumping FTT onto the market, other holders of the token took note, panic-selling their FTT tokens and racing to withdraw funds from FTX as rumors of insolvency circulated.  FTX was eventually forced to pause user withdrawals on Tuesday morning – causing chaos within the crypto markets. After Coinbase, OKX and perhaps other firms passed on SBF’s requests for rescue capital, he swallowed his pride and went to CZ for help.  The Binance bailout  Binance’s acquisition of FTX’s non-US operations, which apparently fell apart after Binance took a look at the FTX books, would have plugged a hole in FTX’s balance sheet that may total more than a billion dollars. FTX has a separate U.S. entity, FTX.US, that was not impacted by the acquisition or insolvency.  A Binance purchase of FTX would not have been unlike Bank of America’s buyout of Merrill Lynch during the 2008 financial crisis, which saved the firm from bankruptcy and saved depositors from losing all of their funds although it did require a subsequent bailout from the U.S. government.  Now that the deal has fallen apart, depositors in FTX risk losing some of their funds unless someone else is willing to come to the rescue, which may not happen depending on the size of the hole in FTX’s balance sheet. If a rescue doesn't come, the next step for FTX may be to declare bankruptcy.  FTX was a massive presence in cryptocurrency, sports and other industries. Whatever happens, regulators – once persuaded by SBF’s pro-government posturing – will be sure to take notice, projects (like Solana) linked to the firm will be left on shaky ground, and opponents of centralized crypto companies will be emboldened.  Why it’s a big deal  A shocking portrait of hubris and deceit, the collapse of FTX – the impact of which will continue to ripple across the crypto universe in the coming weeks and months – will make SBF a prime target for regulators and skeptics hoping to rid the cryptocurrency industry of its wildest excesses.  FTX's potential insolvency is particularly notable given SBF’s previous reputation among regulators as “one of the good guys.”  A crypto golden boy, SBF was U.S. President Joe Biden’s second-largest donor in the 2020 election, a major donor in the 2022 midterms and a constant presence in Washington, D.C., seeking to provide a friendly face to regulators suspicious of the crypto industry.  When the wider crypto market plunged this past spring following the $60 billion Terra project collapse, SBF fashioned himself as a sort of modern J.P. Morgan, bailing out firms such as BlockFi and Voyager Digital, which went bankrupt after mismanaging user funds behind the scenes (in much a similar fashion, it would turn out, to what FTX may have done).  SBF positioned FTX in contrast to those firms, stating that he – unlike the other big players – acted responsibly with user money, never rehypothecating (or re-using) assets and losing them like with so many other failed projects.  Though FTX’s collapse doesn’t speak to the core technology behind any specific cryptocurrency, it has and will damage trust in the entire industry. Specifically, it will raise questions around the power of centralized platforms – like FTX, Binance, Kraken and Coinbase – that “custody” user funds rather than leave them in users' own crypto wallets.  Should FTX declare bankruptcy, user deposits will remain in limbo. We don’t know exactly what portion of user funds FTX still has on hand, but an old-fashioned bankruptcy could have a catastrophic financial impact on the whole industry, given the number of big-name institutions that have poured money into the FTX platform.

42388724,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRRByj,1668026382,Solana Blockchain Hit by FTX Tremors as Nearly $800M SOL Tokens Set to Be Unstaked,"The epic comedown of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange and Alameda Research trading firm is making waves in the market for the Solana blockchain’s SOL token – to the point where some investors have apparently become so nervous that they’re demanding back tokens they had “staked” or deposited into the blockchain’s underlying security protocol.  Earlier this week, when concerns started to grow over the state of the two businesses’ finances, crypto market analysts began to speculate that Alameda might need to sell some of its SOL tokens to raise liquidity. The fears sent the SOL price tumbling – as traders rushed to get ahead of the selling pressure.  Now, apparently, the dynamic has risen to another level: Solana validators who provide security to the blockchain are set to unlock nearly $800 million worth of their SOL holdings as the end of the token lock-in period known as “Epoch 370” approaches – in fewer than 13 hours.  Read More: Crypto.com Halts Solana USDC and USDT Deposits, Withdrawals  And analysts are speculating whether investors might dump these soon-to-unlocked SOL tokens as soon as they recover them. SOL's price recently plunged 42% to less than $14 in the past 24 hours.  “A reduction in the amount of SOL staked might indicate that investors are looking to sell all or part of their position,” Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at research firm FundStrat wrote in a note on Tuesday evening following the bailout news. “Due to these factors, we think it is wise to reduce exposure to Solana (SOL) in the immediate term.”  Solana Compass’ blockchain data showed that about 55 million SOL tokens, worth around $776 million, are scheduled to unlock.  There’s about 76% of eligible SOL tokens currently being staked on the blockchain. The scheduled unlocked tokens represent around 15% of the token’s circulating supply in a single unlock.  Read More: Staked SOL Tokens Falter as Solana Traders, Stakers Rush for Exits  Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, told CoinDesk Monday that SOL is Alameda's second-largest holding, and it also holds significant amounts of SOL ecosystem tokens like MAPS and OXY. MAPS was recently down 20% to $0.1, while OXY was down 14% to $0.03, according to CoinGecko.  An “epoch” on the Solana blockchain refers to the time period when staking rewards are earned and then issued. Validators will lock in their stake on the blockchain during this period, which takes about two days, and can choose to unlock the tokens once the epoch is over.  Solana’s price drop accelerated Tuesday as the giant crypto exchange Binance first said it intended to buy FTX and continued Wednesday as CoinDesk reported that Binance was leaning toward not completing the takeover. Last week, CoinDesk reported that a copy of Alameda's balance sheet showed that the firm held $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.”  SOL’s funding rates sharply dropped as low as -4% on Wednesday in anticipation of the unlock, according to Coinglass.

FTX, one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, is facing a liquidity crisis and thus only increasing the likelihood of a domino effect on other market participants. I expect a slowdown in the Fed's interest rate hike in 2023, and as a result, this will lead to an increase in interest in cryptocurrencies. Holders continue to accumulate Bitcoin despite the decline in interest from most cryptocurrency investors. After a period of low cryptocurrency volatility, the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) fell sharply from $21,400 to $17,150 and is currently trading in a narrow price range of $18,100-$18,500 after a slight recovery. As described in my previous Bitcoin article , the key reason for the fall below the psychological threshold of $20,000 per Bitcoin is the Fed's fourth consecutive increase in the Fed's interest rate to a record high in the past sixteen years. Investors continue to massively withdraw from risky assets, which only increases the tension in both the stock and cryptocurrency markets, while more conservative participants with significant financial resources seek to wait out the period of macroeconomic instability in assets that bring dividends or coupon payments. Source: N_Aisenstadt — TradingView This article will present factors that indicate continued downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin, but at the same time, some of them begin to indicate the appearance of the first glimpses of hope for the end of the bearish trend in the medium term. Bears control the situation in the cryptocurrency market One of the most effective tools for tracking and modeling changes in trends in the cryptocurrency market and sentiment among Bitcoin users is the analysis of on-chain activity. The dynamics of new on-chain addresses continue to decline from multi-year highs reached in May 2021, when mass euphoria swept almost all markets and new participants opened wallets and invested in “digital gold”. However, even then, the first signals of a decrease in interest in Bitcoin appeared, as the average monthly rate of new addresses fell below the 365-day simple moving average marked in pink in the chart below. Moreover, a similar situation was observed in February 2018, after which the price of Bitcoin collapsed by 73% in less than a year. At the moment, the momentum of New Addresses is close to another upward spurt, as it happened in November 2018 after a multi-month period of low volatility and marked by a revival of hopes for the start of a new cycle of growth in demand for Bitcoin. However, this was a vain hope, as the price of Bitcoin collapsed from $6,600 to $3,300, and thus finally discouraged the majority of potential investors from buying “digital gold”. Moreover, at times of maximum stress among market participants and the subsequent formation of a bottom, the number of new addresses always reached a value of 240 thousand, which we still have not seen. As a consequence, this once again indicates that the current price range is not a bottom before a new up cycle begins. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode The logical consequence of the slowdown in the opening of new crypto wallets is a slowdown in the growth of the number of addresses with a non-zero balance, as most investors continue to exchange Bitcoin for fiat money and reinvest it in financial assets with less risk. A similar situation could be observed in the first three quarters of 2018, when the price of Bitcoin, after a sharp fall, remained in a narrow price range of $3,200-$4,000 for several months, while the S&P 500 ( SPY ) and Nasdaq 100 ( QQQ ) continued their upward movement. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Miners continue to experience the hardest times In my previous article, “Anticipating Crypto Crisis: Bitcoin Price Might Drop 35%”, I pointed out the continued dire situation in the mining industry, with hashrate and network difficulty setting new records and thereby provoking companies to sell off more coins to continue their activities. As of November 9, 2022, Bitcoin's average production cost is $19,600 while the spot price has fallen below $18,000. The last time a similar situation happened was four years ago and eventually led to a mass capitulation of miners. At the moment, miners earn only 3.47 BTC per day for every Exahash, or 62.5 thousand in dollar terms, which is 25.2% less than last quarter. Increased competition among such mastodons of the industry as Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) and HIVE Blockchain Technologies ( HIVE ) does not lead to the recovery of the cryptocurrency market, but only aggravates the situation and the longer this happens, the longer the period of its recovery will continue. I expect the sideways trend in the $12,700-$13,600 price range, in which more patient investors will accumulate coins in their wallets, to last a little longer than before. As a consequence, this will lead to a significant decrease in the investment interest of those who try to make a quick profit in this market and will also maintain downward pressure on the share prices of crypto miners. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode A period of apathy among crypto market participants due to a sharp drop in the profitability of their investments leads to the transition of Bitcoin from more impulsive investors to those who understand the value of cryptocurrencies. These trends can be analyzed using the percent of supply in profit, which provides information about the state of the market cycle. At the moment, this indicator continues to be in a downward trend and thus demonstrates the dominance of the share of supply in losses and, as a result, the preservation of bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Holders continue to accumulate Bitcoin Despite the decline in interest and confidence in cryptocurrencies, long-term investors do not lose optimism about the future of Bitcoin and continue to accumulate it. The share of U.S. dollar wealth held in BTC that hasn't moved in the last six months has hit a multi-year low. In previous Bitcoin cycles, such extremely low values were marked by the formation of the bottom of the main cryptocurrency and, in my opinion, a similar situation will repeat in 2022-2023. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Conclusion Since writing my last bearish article in October 2022, the price of Bitcoin has fallen by more than 10%, which is consistent with my expectations for the behavior of the cryptocurrency market, which is experiencing capital outflows to less risky assets. Source: Nathan Aisenstadt — Seeking Alpha The panic among high-risk assets, including those traded on the stock market, does not contribute to the transition of Bitcoin from a bearish trend to a bullish one. The network difficulty sets new multi-year records and thus reduces investment in the mining industry, which is in dire need of additional funding to buy more efficient equipment. Moreover, the increase in downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin comes at a time when one of the global crypto-currency exchanges, namely FTX (FTT-USD), is facing a liquidity crisis and thus only increasing the likelihood of a domino effect on other market participants. On the other hand, prerequisites for the end of the bearish trend are beginning to appear due to an increase in the number of long-term holders who are confident in the bright future of cryptocurrencies. In addition, I expect a slowdown in the Fed rate hike in 2023 due to the slowdown in U.S. inflation and the victory of the Republicans in the elections to the House of Representatives. As a result, the Democrats will not be able to promote all their ideas, which required multibillion-dollar investments with the subsequent rise in inflation, and as a result, this will lead to an easing of the Fed's monetary policy. As a result, investors will begin to consider investing in high-risk assets such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and Cardano ( ADA-USD ). From the point of view of technical analysis, as in the previous article, I expect the price of Bitcoin to decline to the range of $12,700-$13,600, after which there will be a multi-month period of accumulation and the cycle will start again.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4555528-panic-among-bitcoin-investors-intensifies-when-will-it-end?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4006512.jpeg
4006468,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=510127,1668026180,OKB Token Still Holds Above 14% Following Market Plummet,"Thanks to the FTX/Alameda saga, the crypto market has taken a nosedive, dragging everyone along. But while the entire market bleeds, OKB, the native token of OKX exchange, has held on to substantial weekly gains. Specifically, the token is trading at $18.61, a 14.57% rise in the last seven days. However, its daily price hasn’t been pretty. As of writing, OKB has lost over 12%, and there’s no hope of recovery anytime soon. The only other crypto that held on to its weekly gain was Polygon’s MATIC. The token kept over 9% from last week but has since shed all that profit. It has joined the rest of the market in the red zone with a 6% 7-day loss. Related Reading: FTX Legal Department Jumps Ship, Binance Deal Fizzles Out Can OKB Continue To Hold, Or Will It Join The Rest Of The Market? While OKB has held on to substantial gains, it seems unlikely to keep it for long. The token enjoyed a 24% price surge earlier in the week after the exchange opened a shop in the Bahamas. At the time, the token solidified itself as the third-highest gainer of the week. However, the FTX liquidity crisis news proved a stronger opponent to the token’s bullish run. The token has remained strong even though its trading volume and market cap have dropped in the last 24 hours. However, if OKB continues to hold above $18, then it will be able to maintain its current position. But if the token drops below this level, it could find itself joining the rest of the market. If this happens, it won’t be easy to recover. As per the charts, OKB still looks like it can continue holding above $18. Looking at its price movement against BTC and ETH, we can see that OKB has gained much over both these assets. Plus, technical indicators on TradingView suggest that the token still has strong momentum. CMC Community Losing Faith In OKB’s Potential The CoinMarketCap community isn’t so bullish about OKB’s prospects. Based on the platform’s price prediction tool, CMC traders forecast a further drop in OKB’s price by the end of December. Specifically, they see OKB dropping to an average of $16 before the year runs out. This is an 11% drop from its current price. The last time OKB was trading at $16 was earlier this month. So, falling back to that range may not be new for the token. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Looks Good Above $0.75 Despite Market Turmoil; Here Is Why? In fact, the token has always found support below that range since September this year. Specifically, after its September 8 spike, it picked up a support level of $14.50. Since then, it has maintained a steady trade between that level and $17. Looking at its chart setup, OKB may try to use $17 as a new resistance level. If the market breaks out of its latest FTX-related slump, it might get a chance to test $20 again. However, no one knows when the market will turn around.

42388703,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRRAXr,1668024100,FTX and Alameda Contagion Fears Tank NFT Markets,"Non-fungible token (NFT) markets are experiencing a stunning landslide in the wake of the news of Binance’s potential acquisition of FTX, shaking up several prominent exchanges.  Built on the backs of Ethereum and Solana, NFTs have fallen in value drastically in the past day since a scoop from CoinDesk spurred the collapse of FTX. While Binance’s plan to purchase Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire briefly paused prices from dropping, fresh doubts that the deal will finalize have driven prices down again.  In the past day, ETH has fallen nearly 7% and SOL has tumbled 37%.  Solana's price drop on Monday sparked speculation that Alameda had sold off a large tranche of SOL in a rush to earn new liquidity. The research firm's balance sheet showed SOL as its second-largest holding.  Regardless of what actually happened, NFT marketplaces are feeling the pain of this contagion.  According to data from Dune Analytics, OpenSea’s daily NFT trading volume on Solana has fallen from about 4,900 SOL, or $70,000, to just shy of 1,000 SOL, or $14,000 since Tuesday. For Solana-based leading NFT marketplace Magic Eden, trading volume of SOL has fallen from about 153,000 SOL or $2.5 million to almost 84,000 SOL, or about $1.4 million.  Additional data from Dune showcases OpenSea’s daily trading volume on Ethereum has also fallen from about 6,000 ETH, or $7.1 million, to about 3,900 ETH or $4.6 million in the past day.  According to a Tweet posted Wednesday by Twitter user @Punk9059, director of research at NFT collective PROOF, OpenSea is experiencing its all-time high ratio of wrapped ETH to ETH volume, meaning that NFT buyers are purchasing NFTs at bid prices, rather than buyers purchasing assets at seller’s offer prices, suggesting that users are trying to liquidate as soon as possible.  While FTX.US’s NFT marketplace won’t be a part of Binance’s basket at checkout, it’s home to NFTs built on Solana and Ethereum, whose values are tanking as these tokens face the blow of these assets dropping in value while liquidations are underway.

Smith told CoinDesk TV on Wednesday that “lawmakers are very much paying attention” to what happens next with the FTX exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. A CoinDesk scoop revealed the exchange’s corporate sibling, Alameda Research, had substantial amounts of FTT tokens (FTX’s native token) on its balance sheet. The rival Binance exchange started selling its holdings of FTX's tokens. That sparked a panic that has led to a proposed Binance takeover of most of FTX's operations.  “It’s going to invite a lot of scrutiny into how centralized exchanges should be regulated,” Smith said during an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.” However, she added, “what happened with FTX may not be able to be addressed by U.S. regulation” because units Binance.US and FTX.US are “not part of this deal.”  Read more: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried’s Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda’s Balance Sheet  Bahamas-based FTX’s survival is likely to depend on whether Binance, the largest exchange in the world by volume, follows through with its letter of intent to buy it. FTX was once the fourth-largest exchange by volume, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Still, if the deal were to happen (though it now appears unlikely), it would mean Binance would dominate upwards of 80% of the global crypto market, raising anti-trust concerns of a foreign-based company owning an exchange with a substantial amount of U.S. retail users.  Smith said FTX’s unsteady future only highlights what has been seen in the past. “Congress is very interested” in finding a way to “regulate the spot markets” by having exchanges register with the Commodities Futures trading Commission (CFTC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), she said.  “As part of that, you could have some sort of proof of reserves and guidelines around what you’re supposed to do with customer deposits,” Smith said, referring to the idea that when users place their crypto on an exchange “there’s an expectation … that it’s not being taken and lent out.”  Read more: Binance Is Strongly Leaning Toward Scrapping FTX Rescue Takeover After First Glance at Books: Source  “This is going to open up a more robust debate around exchange regulation,” Smith said.  Smith’s views on regulations were echoed by Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who was reelected to Congress in Tuesday's elections. Himes told CoinDesk TV that one thing is clear: The government needs to speed up its work on establishing a clear regulatory playing field.  Himes noted, as did Smith, that the acquisition of an exchange with a substantial number of U.S. retailer users by a foreign player raises antitrust concerns.  “Whenever there's a question of Chinese investment in a technologically innovative business, a lot of antennas go up,” said Himes, who was a former banker during the late 1990s. (Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao is Chinese.)  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried No Longer a Billionaire After $14.6B Wipeout: Bloomberg  Despite crypto playing almost “no role” in how Americans voted, Himes said that “there are plenty of Republicans [and] Democrats who are excited to put forward a regulatory framework that will create a lot of certainty.”  He added that as the FTX-Binance debacle unravels, “Investors in this [crypto] space need to understand that it is an immature and volatile market and they need to be careful.”",NEUTRAL,FTT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB | FTT,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/09/binance-ftx-deal-will-bring-regulatory-scrutiny-on-crypto-exchanges-blockchain-associations-kristin-smith,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e95ce08064a066cf51fa2c92a4ebaaec5b48980c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MATIC’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. MATIC’s price remains weak across all timeframes as the price trades slightly below the 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). In the last two days, the crypto market has been erratic with the price of many altcoins, including Polygon (MATIC), battling for survival. Previous weeks saw the price of Polygon (MATIC) outperform Bitcoin (BTC). Most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including Polygon (MATIC) rallying from a region of $1.3, with many hoping the price of MATIC would pull off a good price action to a region of $1.5. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Crypto Giant Coinbase Not Interested In Buying FTX U.S, COIN Stock Plunges Polygon (MATIC) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The previous week saw many altcoins produced over 200% gains over the past 7 days of breaking out of their range-bound movement, as many believe more hope is returning to the crypto space. The new week has yet to look like the previous as the week has looked choked with FUD (Fear of uncertainty and doubt), leading to many altcoins being affected negatively in price as major coins have been struggling to stay afloat from what looks like a crypto purge. Still, the price of MATIC has continued to look strong after breaking below its weekly high of $1, which has served as support after flipping the price, acting as a supply zone initially. The support formed at $0.75 has proven to be key to holding off the price from sell-offs. The price of MATIC breaking below the support at $0.75 is not good for the market as this would weaken this region for bears to push the price lower. Weekly resistance for the price of MATIC – $1. Weekly support for the price of MATIC – $0.75. Price Analysis Of MATIC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of MATIC remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $0.75 support, holding off the price from trending lower after retesting this region on previous times, bouncing off to begin a rally to a region of $1. MATIC’s price closed above $0.8 daily, indicating there are more chances of MATIC trending upwards to a region of $1 as the market continues to recover in the coming days. If the price of MATIC holds above $0.75 support on the daily timeframe, we could see the price recover in no time, but if the price closes below this region, it would be tough to rally higher. Daily resistance for the MATIC price – $1. Daily support for the MATIC price – $0.75-$0.66.

42388716,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRRBId,1668021036,Who Still Has Exposure to FTX?,"CORRECTION (Nov. 9 19:53 UTC): Corrects subhead and the first entry to Genesis from Gemini.  The crypto industry is in turmoil afterinsolvency issues drove major exchange FTX to accept a nonbinding acquisition offer from rival Binance that might not go through. FTX suspended withdrawals on Tuesday, but some peers and major traders still have assets stuck on the exchange.  Genesis  In response to the market volatility on Tuesday, Genesis, a trading firm for institutional investors, tweeted on Nov. 9 that it ""hedged and sold collateral resulting in a total loss of ~$7M across all counterparties, including Alameda.""  Genesis reiterated that it has no material exposure to FTX’s native FTT token and has no lending relationship with FTX. The exchanges have a trading relationship – ""amongst other exchanges"" – but the exposure ""has no impact on our ability to serve our clients.""  On Thursday, Genesis tweeted that its derivatives business currently has about $175 million in locked funds in its FTX trading account, which doesn't impact its market-making activities. The trading firm also noted that its operating capital and net positions in FTX are not material to its business and recent events surrounding FTX haven't impeded the full functioning of its trading franchise.  Genesis and CoinDesk share the same parent company: Digital Currency Group.  Wintermute  The market maker, which helps provide liquidity to crypto exchanges, reduced its exposure to FTX once the initial solvency concerns were raised.  Wintermute tweeted that it has remaining funds on FTX and noted that “while this is not ideal, the amount is within our risk tolerances and does not have a significant impact on our overall financial position.”  Multicoin Capital  Crypto-focused venture capital firm Multicoin Capital has around 10% of the total assets under management of its Master Fund stuck as pending withdrawals on FTX, according to a letter from the firm viewed by The Block.  Multicoin was able to move about 24% of its FTX-held assets before the withdrawal freeze went into effect on Tuesday. The stuck assets include bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and USD.  Amber Group  The market maker has no exposure to FTX sister company Alameda or the FTT token, but the trading firm has been an active participant on the FTX exchange.  “While we have significantly reduced our exposure over the course of the week, we still have withdrawals that have yet to be processed,” wrote the firm, noting that the stuck assets represent less than 10% of Amber Group’s total trading capital and doesn’t “pose a threat to our business operations or liquidity.”  Liquid Meta  Liquid Meta (LIQQF), a decentralized finance infrastructure and technology company, used FTX for a number of services, including onboarding and offboarding currencies and coins used in its liquidity mining operations, according to a press release. The company also used FTX for overcollateralized loans used in Liquid Meta’s operations.  As of Nov. 9, Liquid Meta held about $7.5 million in cash, stable coins and other digital assets via FTX, of which the company directly holds and has access to $3.2 million of borrowed stable coins and assets, leaving a net balance of approximately $4.3 million.  Liquid Meta doesn’t hold any FTT tokens.  CoinShares  European digital asset investment and trading group CoinShares disclosed “limited exposure” to FTX and no exposure to Alameda Research on Twitter. CoinShares “significantly reduced” its FTX exposure in the past week to 26.6 million British pounds ($31 million) of proprietary assets, and notes that its overall financial health remains strong.  The exposure includes 190 bitcoin (BTC) to the tune of $3.1 million and 1,000 ether (ETH) worth about $1.2 million in pending withdrawals. The exposure also includes roughly $25.9 million in USD and USDC and $110,000 of other assets.  Pantera Capital  Crypto-focused investment giant Pantera Capital said in blog post that most if its exposure to FTX was from ""Blockfolio acquisition proceeds, which were denominated in FTT and FTX stock."" However, it liquidated as much of FTT tokens as possible on November 8. Prior to that, FTT token positions totaled under 3% of total firm's assets under management (AUM), Pantera said. According to a its website, it had $4.5 billion in AUM.  UPDATE (Nov. 10, 14:30 UTC): Updates to add Liquid Meta's response.  UPDATE (Nov. 10, 16:02 UTC): Updates to add CoinShares' response.

Bitcoin Spent Output Value Bands Shows Spike From 1k-10k Group As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, unlike in the previous declines, the 10-100 BTC and 100-1k BTC cohorts didn’t show any spikes in activity during the latest crash. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Value Bands” (SOVB). which displays the number of coins being moved by each value band in the Bitcoin market. These “value bands” or groups are divided based on the amount of coins moved in each transaction on the chain. For example, the 1k-10k BTC value band includes all transfers that involved between 1k and 10k BTC. The Spent Output metric for this value band then specifically measures the total amount of Bitcoin that was shifted using transactions of size falling in this range. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOVB for 10-100 BTC: The value of the metric seems to have been normal recently | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, during the previous selloffs, the Bitcoin Spent Output chart for the 10-100 BTC value band spiked up, suggesting that investors with at least 10 to 100 BTC were heavily selling their coins.

Such big transfers belong to the whales, meaning that whales drove this crash. While whale dumping is negative for the market, the quant notes that the decline in the other two cohorts could be a sign that selling pressure is now almost exhausted in the Bitcoin market.

The largest token issued by Lido (stSOL) was trading 7% below its underlying asset Wednesday even as a competing token from Marinade (mSOL) traded above SOL’s volatile market price. These so-called liquid staking tokens represent the rights to assets currently locked up with Solana validators as well as validator rewards; they usually trade at a slight premium to SOL.  But SOL’s massive correction in the wake of crypto exchange FTX’s surprise implosion has rattled the entire crypto landscape – especially Solana decentralized finance. Lenders and borrowers are facing a monumental crunch of drained asset pools and cratering prices spawned by SOL’s nearly 60% drawdown in a week. Fears that FTX’s sister firm could sell its SOL holdings is only making matters worse.

Méndez, head of growth at Marinade, said staked SOL tokens can prove volatile in markets such as this: “Say, if people want to exit before the end of the epoch and trade where others are [arbitraging] – but if you wait until the end of the epoch, you will get the full value back.”  Read More: Solana Blockchain Hit by FTX Tremors as Nearly $800M SOL Tokens Set to Be Unstaked  Market fears have kicked off a staking exodus from Solana validators.

42388709,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRRAlt,1668016275,US Regulators Probing FTX Handling of Customer Funds: Bloomberg,"U.S. securities and commodities regulators are probing whether FTX.com correctly managed client funds, despite statements this week by the ailing crypto exchange’s CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, that all customer holdings were covered, according to sources cited by Bloomberg Wednesday.  The inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission date back several months and started as a probe into the crypto lending activities of FTX's U.S. counterpart, FTX US. But the investigations are related to the issues that have caused FTX's current liquidity crisis and look at the relationship between FTX.com, its trading house Alameda Research and FTX US, according to Bloomberg's report.  On Tuesday, rival exchange Binance said it was planning to buy the non-U.S. business of FTX, citing a “severe liquidity crunch,” but there are now indications a review of FTX’s books has led to a change of heart on Binance's part.  In a tweet posted Monday and subsequently deleted, Bankman-Fried said his company “has enough to cover all client holdings.”  “We don’t invest client assets,” he said, in an apparent bid to stave off a bank run. “FTX is fine. Assets are fine.”  Last week, CoinDesk revealed that Alameda and FTX were more closely linked than had been thought, with much of Alameda’s balance sheet assets in the form of FTX’s token, FTT.

The token’s price drop follows a bearish market sentiment that sees major coins plummet on the day. The past seven days had seen the token climb steadily. It even tried reaching its 6-month high of $0.488 yesterday. However, its rally was cut short and only registered an intraday high of $0.409. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Defend $1,200 Support As Price Holds; How Long Will This Last? Algorand’s price dump comes as news of FTX acquisition by Binance surfaces. This single news has dragged the entire market into the red zone, with alpha crypto Bitcoin falling below $18k again. ALGO Consolidating And Accumulating Between $0.28 And $0.42 ALGO’s price has been on a significant slump throughout 2022 up to May. Since reaching an all-time high of $2.41 in September 2021, the token has only known downward trends. However, the token has formed a pattern these past months, starting from June. Specifically, ALGO has been fluctuating around $0.28 and $0.42, with the midrange being $0.35. This pointed to the possibility that the coin was through a period of accumulation. The A/D indicator also showed an upward trend, indicating sustained buyer interest. Since June, the indicator has been making higher lows. Conversely, the CMF has followed the bear-bull battles by swinging back and forth between negative and positive values. At press time, the CMF was below zero, indicating that no substantial funds were entering the market. Instead, more funds were leaving. Can ALGO Break Past This Range? It’s highly unlikely. The overall market sentiment fueled by FTX/Binance news has already pulled ALGO from its upward trend. The RSI is already in the overbought zone and has started a downward movement. As of writing, the token is trading at around $0.2961, a 27% loss on the day. A bearish order block formed above the range highs in May, indicating the market’s extreme volatility during that month. The range was from $0.41 to $0.49, implying strong resistance for ALGO up to the round $0.5 level. What Pulled ALGO and Other Tokens’ Prices Under? Earlier in the day yesterday, tokens across the crypto market pumped substantially after FTX’s acquisition by Binance was revealed. The news came after several days of rumors about FTX and Alameda’s liquidity issue. However, the news couldn’t sustain much bullish pressure, causing the market to sink. All profits gained on the day were wiped out by more than 15% across the board. As of this writing, FTT had lost over 76% of its value, falling below the $4 threshold. The price of Solana came under pressure, retracing 39% to around $16. ALGO also suffered a 27% loss.

FTX is best known for its quirky billionaire founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. Investors pulled $6 billion in deposits from FTX after allegations that customers' crypto was not fully backed. This was after FTX itself had rescued other crypto exchanges earlier in the year. A bailout is in the works by rival Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange. But the bailout is non-binding, and it's very possible they pull out after doing due diligence. Bitcoin crashed nearly 14% in the immediate aftermath, while the value of FTX's token (FTT) tanked nearly 80% in one day. You can't make this stuff up! What The Heck Happened to FTX? While the world was busy with U.S. midterm elections, the crypto world was rocked by a multi-billion dollar run on the exchange FTX, formerly valued at $32 billion. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was down 14% at one point, while FTX's token ( FTT-USD ) plummeted by 80% on relatively low volume (in my opinion) given the magnitude of the crash. FTX is best known for its Bahamas-based billionaire founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. Over the last 6 months, Sam Bankman-Fried has testified before Congress about Bitcoin regulation, bought 7.6% of Robinhood ( HOOD ), bailed out Voyager Digital (VYGVQ), and donated nearly $40 million to various political races. But now, FTX may have been a house of cards all along after depositors pulled $6 billion and it suspended customer withdrawals. Thankfully, the small part of FTX that operates onshore in the U.S. seems to be operating normally for now. Before this, Bankman-Fried had been compared to J.P. Morgan ( the man, not the bank ) as a savior to the industry. A potential bailout for FTX customers by rival exchange Binance (BNB-USD) is now in the works, but it's not bound to buy the company if the balance sheet turns out worse than it thought, and as of Wednesday morning, that was looking like a distinct possibility . Data by YCharts So what happened? Sam Bankman-Fried (a.k.a. SBF) recently became embroiled in an increasingly bitter Twitter (TWTR) feud with Binance founder and fellow crypto billionaire Changpeng Zhao (a.k.a. CZ). Zhao operates out of Singapore, and unlike SBF, cultivates an image as more of a rebel- almost entirely eschewing the idea of onshore regulation. The public feud is especially unusual because Binance/Zhao was previously a large investor in FTX, and took ~$2 billion in FTX's token when they later divested. Friends No More: Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao (Twitter) Zhao and Bankman-Fried have had no love lost for a while now, but things seem to have heated up when Bankman-Fried seemed to imply in a tweet late last month that Zhao may be unable to physically come to the United States- which I'm guessing is an allusion to the ongoing investigation of Binance for money laundering . Zhao has claimed that Bankman-Fried was lobbying Congress against competitors like Binance behind their backs. But the tables soon turned. Not long after, an article came out citing leaked documents detailing the possibility that much of SBF's assets in his main company, Alameda Research, were tied up in highly illiquid assets while his liabilities could potentially be called, threatening FTX as well. Since then, independent analysis of the FTT token's liquidity paints a troubling picture as well. Zhao's response- he would sell his stake in Bankman-Fried's FTT token. Bankman Fried's second-in-command then said they'll buy the tokens back for $22 . Zhao called the bluff and started unloading hundreds of millions of dollars of coins on the open market. But while SBF was a deca-billionaire on paper, his team didn't have the cash liquid to defend the $22 level. Not having the money to defend the peg on FTT then sparked a giant bank run on FTX, with depositors reportedly pulling $6 billion in assets in just 3 days. As of yesterday, FTX has suspended withdrawals. Insane! And not having the money here creates the rebuttable presumption that despite being hailed as a financial genius by the media, Bankman-Fried's empire may have been fueled in large part by risky bets with depositor money. This is a really bad look, especially considering the wild spending on acquisitions, political contributions, and sponsorships of NBA, MLB, and Formula 1 racing. SBF even tried to co-invest in Elon Musk for the Twitter buyout but was rejected by Musk. FTX recently raised $420 million from investors, led by the Ontario Teacher's Pension Fund . That money is likely gone forever. Bloomberg has estimated in a back-of-the-envelope calculation that 94% of Bankman-Fried's net worth has now been ""eviscerated"" . So what will happen to FTX? Bankman-Fried went silent on Twitter after days of vocally defending FTX. Then after getting slammed with withdrawals, SBF tweeted that Binance is entering a "" strategic transaction "" with FTX to buy the offshore part of FTX that represents the vast majority of the company's total operations. Binance Bailout: Will Binance Buy FTX? Probably. But then again, maybe not . The wording of the tweet and the thread below it offering a ""huge thank you"" make it seem like an apology was demanded by CZ's team. Strategic transaction in this case means a fire sale like the one where Bear Stearns was bought for $2 per share after trading for $150. SBF bailed out BlockFi and Voyager Digital this summer for pennies on the dollar, and now the hunter has become the prey. How much is FTX worth? A few months ago, it was valued at $32 billion. Now it might be worth zero if it's not bailed out, or it might be worth whatever Binance agrees to pay for it. So is this legal? It probably wouldn't be in the U.S., at least not for banks or broker-dealers. Spreading rumors about competing banks is understood to threaten the whole system. But in the offshore crypto world, people tend to be based in jurisdictions that take a more relaxed view of these sorts of things as long as the money is flowing. In some ways, this is genius for Zhao because he called a competitor's bluff on having liquidity and essentially got FTX's business for free. The deal is so good for Zhao that he gets to now do due diligence and either re-trade or back out of the deal if he finds the financials are worse than expected. Remember that shotgun weddings between firms in 2008 almost brought down several banks, most notably Bank of America ( BAC ) after they absorbed Countrywide Financial. But in other ways, it's problematic. Binance is the largest crypto exchange in the world. That means if Binance subsequently runs into trouble, there's no one to rescue it. Bankman-Fried famously said in July that the shoes had all dropped . Scarcely more than 100 days later, FTX's shoes were the ones to drop. The irony is thick here. Were their assets really that concentrated in a bunch of altcoins and their liabilities in US dollars? I suppose we will soon find out more. How Does The FTX Scandal Impact Bitcoin? SBF likely owns a lot of Bitcoin, so he's going to be a forced seller. That's going to put a bunch of pressure on BTC in the coming days. He owns a lot of Robinhood as well, so that's probably going to be on the sale block. He probably will be dumping U.S. Treasuries too (the Treasury market can handle it) and a bunch of other random assets. I'd assume that FTT will suffer the same fate as Terra ( LUNA-USD ) and that it will be worth close to zero. Data by YCharts There's a very important distinction that may be lost in the hoopla around the possible insolvency and bailout of FTX. Bitcoin is a decentralized algorithm that allows people to store value on the blockchain. The vast majority of these slick ""innovations,"" charismatic founders, and pyramid schemes are coat-tailing the massive success that Bitcoin has had by offering an alternative to central bank currency. By and large, altcoins are not the real deal though. Seeking Alpha contributor Lyn Alden Schwartzer recently called them "" clown bucks ."" I'll give them credit- a lot of these guys are slick. While there's yet no clear and convincing evidence of anything criminal happening at FTX, crypto hustlers fooled pension funds, fooled Congress in some cases, and as with BlockFi, they fooled me and my friends, although thankfully I redeemed my money before the crisis. There are many legitimate opportunities to add value in the world, but crypto seems that it may have attracted some of the shadiest people. This isn't inherently Bitcoin's fault- recently we've seen how Bitcoin has lent a lifeline to groups of people living under Lebanon's collapsing government. A recent CNBC piece profiled a 22-year-old running a Bitcoin mining operation off of hydropower, solar panels, and fuel. When done right, Bitcoin is a tool of freedom. When done wrong, Bitcoin is exchanged to buy gambling chips at the altcoin casino. The last few months have made it abundantly clear that there needs to be reform on the crypto exchange side (to prevent hacks and exchange implosions), and on the regulatory side as well. These efforts are ongoing. Bottom Line Massive crypto exchange FTX is on the brink of collapse, suspended withdrawals, and is awaiting rescue via a fire sale to competitor Binance. High-profile investors like big Silicon Valley venture firms and public pension funds are likely going to lose a ton of money on FTX. You can bet your bottom dollar that criminal and civil investigations have likely already begun in the US and in other countries into how FTX collapsed. Yet another shoe has dropped in the altcoin world, and it likely won't be the last. I do view further failures of altcoins and stablecoins as possibly representing an opportunity to buy Bitcoin for those who believe in the long-term potential. But these events are a very clear warning sign for investors to get out of stablecoins and altcoins before it's too late. Bitcoin will come back, but the money in these crazy DeFi schemes and altcoins is likely going to end up missing after a tragic game of musical chairs. What do you think?

The crypto market plunged into an endless decline yesterday after FTX’s acquisition by Binance was made known. The FTX saga has shaken many crypto investors for days due to rumors that the platform had liquidity issues. This resulted in mass liquidation, especially of the platform’s native token, FTT. Although the acquisition news pushed prices up, bearish sentiments held sway, pulling the market downward. As of writing, MATIC and OKB were the only tokens still holding substantial gains across the top-100 board. Specifically, MATIC is still up by over 2% from last week’s run. However, it was trading at an intraday loss of 26.70%. Related Reading: Crypto Giant Coinbase Not Interested In Buying FTX U.S, COIN Stock Plunges Polygon Adds Over 40 Million Wallets In Six Months Despite Bearish Market Sentiments While much of the cryptocurrency market is again plunging into the red, Polygon still keeps measurable weekly and monthly gains. In addition, it has enjoyed strong network expansion over the previous several months. Specifically, more than 46 million new wallet addresses have been added to the network in the past six months. The data was pulled from the protocol’s network explorer, PolygonScan. There are now over 188 million unique addresses on the Polygon network, up significantly from the 143 million in May. At the beginning of the year, it had about 130 million different addresses. According to the statistics, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network expanded by over 30% within six months. It added approximately 250,000 new unique addresses every single day on average. During this time span, the value of MATIC, the network’s native cryptocurrency, has skyrocketed. Since the beginning of this year, $MATIC has seen a price increase of nearly 58%, according to market statistics. Whereas Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have both had price decreases of 35.6% and 37.6%, respectively. Crypto Community Feels Bearish About MATIC Despite Growing Usage Despite the network’s expansion, price estimates for the cryptocurrency indicate a negative reversal by the end of the year. The crypto community at CoinMarketCap predicted that MATIC might fall to an average of $0.899 before the year ends. But the MATIC price has already touched that level today and currently stands at $0.8894. These forecasts stand in stark contrast to the rapidly expanding usage of the Polygon network. This week, the international banking group JPMorgan conducted the institution’s first-ever transaction using decentralized finance on a public blockchain. Polygon was used with a customized version of the primary decentralized finance lending protocol Aave to complete the transaction.

In the three days since Binance’s announced its intention to sell off its FTT, the token has recorded double-digit losses. However, the losses have not just been localized to one token, the general crypto market has suffered for it, but the worst of it has been reserved for the tokens Alameda Research has invested in. FTT Token Slumps In what has been a shocking development for the entire crypto space at large, FTT Token has crashed more than 80% in a matter of days. The token which was backed by the 2nd largest crypto exchange has continued to suffer significant setbacks. In just the last 24 hours alone, the price of FTT is down more than 70%. The token is now trading at levels not seen since 2020. It has now also hit a new two-year low, making it one of the worst-performing coins of 2022. Related Reading: Institutional Outflows From Bitcoin Paints Bearish Picture For Crypto Market The decline looks eerily similar to that of the LUNA token following the collapse of the Terra network.

FTT token trading at $4.459 | Source: FTTUSD on TradingView.com Interestingly, the trading volume of FTT is up over 130% in the last 24 hours as traders try to take advantage of the token. Short traders have obviously enjoyed the most profit from their activities as FTT’s price dropped from $19 to $3 in a matter of hours. Alameda Tokens Not Left Out Alameda Research was one of the most active firms when it comes to crypto investments, which means they had their hands in a lot of pots in the space. As FTX is being brought to its knees, these other tokens have felt the impact of such a collapse. Solana (SOL) which Alameda is vocally a backer of has been hit the worst of all tokens besides FTT that the firm holds. In the last 24 hours alone, SOL price is down more than 34%. The same is the case for Lido DAO (LDO) which has declined 23% in the last day. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Decline Below $20,000 Proves The Bottom Is Not In Alameda reportedly holds 100 million BitDAO (BIT) tokens and the coin is down 15% in the last 24 hours. 1inch Network has also suffered a similar fate, although to a lesser extent with only 7% in losses in the last day. All DeFi protocols that Alameda is invested in including MobileCoin, Serum, and Liquidity are mostly down double-digits as well.

The GameStop saga of 2021 has now been cataloged in two separate documentaries – aptly named “Eat the Rich” and “Diamond Hands” – which make for compelling TV. The story illustrates the cumulative risks of powerful market players acting as gatekeepers while having little interest in protecting both individual and public interests.  Frederik Gregaard is the CEO of the Cardano Foundation.  The cycle of euphoria and crash that Gamestop epitomized has since played out, to even more devastating effect in the crypto arena. Hundreds of thousands of retail investors were left holding drastically devalued tokens thanks to the mismanagement of high profile investment funds and brokerages. In addition, crypto evangelists with vested interests in the inflated price of these assets and who zealously overhyped them must assume their share of the blame.  My own journey into blockchain started out of frustration. Why weren’t the benefits available to “accredited investors” also available to ordinary citizens? In answering this question, I saw an amazing opportunity to democratize finance through decentralization, empowering individuals to do more with their economic assets and to improve society as they did so.  While I firmly believe in the potential of blockchain, as long as we use the same breath to talk about crypto and meme stocks we are falling far short of that potential.  The true financial potential of blockchain is not as a new set of speculative assets, but as a vehicle for radical transparency, giving power to identity and new forms of governance. Not to mention the efficiency of the technology itself, which can reduce market distortions and volatility, even as it lowers costs and speeds up transaction times.  See also: Blockchain Means So Much More Than Crypto | Opinion  In short, the blockchain mission should not be about promoting specific tokens or taking down Wall Street but about leveling up our entire global financial system.  As we watch liquidity drain from financial reserves at frightening speed, it is critical that we refocus on this mission. We must set our sights on transforming, rather than merely trashing, the titans of Wall Street.  At the Cardano Foundation, we are committed to two difficult things: genuine engagement on the complex problem of how to educate, engage and drive adoption of blockchain technology among traditional enterprises; and active commitment to the principles of decentralization and community best exemplified by the open source software movement.  I believe that addressing any of these two tasks properly helps to solve the other, and that we should prioritize both simultaneously. Just as the transparency embedded in open source software means it is now trusted by blue chip companies to run their most crucial platforms, the openness and legibility of blockchain done right can help to make financial empowerment and disintermediation more than just meme stock buzzwords.  Third-generation blockchain protocols are more sophisticated and more resilient than the creaking technology on which much of our financial system still runs. But no matter how good our tech and how committed our community is, replacing the legacy technology of incumbent banks becomes an even more daunting task than trying to take down hedge funds over-exposed to a single stock. It demands not only revolutionary spirit but also regulatory awareness.

In Europe, the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) will soon go into effect, creating a legal framework for the functioning of crypto-assets markets. Across the Atlantic Ocean, in the U.S., the Biden administration is working to develop laws that spur growth and inhibit fraud.  This increased regulatory activity signals that blockchain technologies are here for the long haul. Right now, lawmakers need to ensure they future-proof their legislation so that, instead of just responding to possible threats, they can throw open the door for honest and beneficial innovation.  As for the industry, it is our job to keep innovating, build more solutions that contribute to society, democratize and simplify finance and enable access and inclusion for everyone.

42388732,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRRM0p,1668012929,Inflation Expected to Tick Down in Latest CPI Report,"While most of the country was waiting on U.S. midterm election results on Tuesday, observers of the economy were already looking toward Thursday’s fresh inflation report.  According to analysts reporting to FactSet, the U.S. Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose an estimated 8% on a year-over-year basis in October, down from the 8.2% reported in September. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is forecast to be 0.5% against 0.6% last month.  The declines come as the U.S. central bank continues its months-long quest of taming inflation without casting the economy into a steep recession. Recent economic indicators have offered faint hope that the Fed could still scale back its recent monetary hawkishness.  Thursday’s data will be the first of two inflation reports before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets for the final time this year on Dec. 14-15.  “That means the market impact may be more muted unless there is major divergence from the estimates,” said Jamie Dutta, market analyst at Vantage.  Last week, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points for a fourth consecutive time in its ongoing effort to curb inflation, which has been stubbornly resilient. But rising short-term bond yields and a struggling stock market have prompted Fed officials to worry about financial stability risks and overtightening.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component are down 34% and 20%, respectively this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that while “incoming data since our last meeting suggests that ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected,” it would be appropriate to slow the pace of rate increases “as soon as the next meeting.”  In this week’s CPI report, the focus will be on “stickier” categories like housing and rents which aren’t expected to decline until spring next year but account for over 30% of the CPI basket, Dutta said.  In addition, the Fed will also be scrutinizing services as they are most responsive to interest rates, said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. “If that gets worse, the Fed will be concerned,” he said.  Last month’s CPI release showed massive growth in bitcoin’s inverse correlation relationship with the U.S. dollar, according to a report by Arcane Research.  The U.S. dollar recently sank from recent highs as market makers see a potential Fed pause in the near future, which would lower gains for the dollar. Bitcoin (BTC) rose to over $21,000 on Friday after Powell's remarks last week but has since dropped sharply amid crypto exchange giant FTX’s struggles and proposed sale to rival Binance.  Because of bitcoin’s inverted relationship with the dollar, a downside surprise in the CPI report this week could push the dollar down decisively, which could give bitcoin a little upside, Arcane Research said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/09/inflation-expected-to-tick-down-in-latest-cpi-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67b3d94edc0aeb4023f531a94ced885881fe6b62-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Silvergate is a crypto-focused bank with its own Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a fiat on-ramp for bitcoin (BTC) markets, with FTX being one of their customers.  Analysts don’t see a lasting hit to Silvergate, however. BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said he spoke on Tuesday to Silvergate's president, Ben Reynolds, who told him that Silvergate neither holds FTT tokens nor lends against them, and that FTX’s challenges have had no direct impact on the company.  “As for the suggestion expressed by some on social media that SI’s SEN Leverage platform could suffer losses due to exposure to FTX, [Reynolds] noted that all of the platform’s loans are significantly overcollateralized by bitcoin that could be liquidated to cover those exposures if necessary,” Palmer wrote in a research note. BTIG has a buy rating and $135 price target on Silvergate.  Separately, Canaccord highlighted that Silvergate doesn’t hold any crypto assets of its own, and should be able to avoid additional risk from the FTX situation.  “In the event that FTX ceases operations or some customers migrate to other exchanges, it is highly likely that Silvergate will still capture that trading volume under its operational umbrella,” Canaccord analyst Joe Vafi told clients in a note. Canaccord has a buy rating and $150 price target on Silvergate.  Silvergate shares are down close to 11% Wednesday morning to $35.26.

42388740,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRRMEr,1668011497,Why Did FTX Pause Withdrawals if It Wasn't Trading Customer Funds?,"Yesterday was one of the most head-spinning days in the entire history of the cryptocurrency industry, with Changpeng Zhao’s Binance signing a letter of intent to acquire, and effectively bail out, Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange. FTX had been considered a huge success story since its founding in 2019, and founder Bankman-Fried had become a respected figurehead.  The issues at FTX have complex roots, but reached a head early Tuesday, Nov. 8, when a huge wave of withdrawals drained FTX of liquidity and effectively froze the platform – almost always a sign of serious issues for a centralized exchange.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The problems at FTX were shocking for many reasons, but perhaps most frightening is the simple fact that customer funds seemingly weren’t where they were supposed to be. As many observers pointed out, the liquidity crunch implies FTX violated its own terms of service, which read:  “None of the Digital Assets in your Account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading; FTX Trading does not represent or treat Digital Assets in User’s Accounts as belonging to FTX Trading.”  (This would not include customers who opted in to the FTX Earn product, which offered yield on deposits.)  The restrictive terms are a useful contrast with a platform like Celsius Network, whose entire premise was using customer funds to generate returns through speculative lending and trading. Celsius failed spectacularly at this task and melted down earlier this year, taking customer funds with it.  But deposits at FTX were not supposed to be subject to that kind of risk – while individual tokens might lose value, the expectation of a centralized exchange is that they won’t gamble with your money.  However, there are suddenly hints that something else may have been going on. Among those signs were dark intimations from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in an interview with Bloomberg late Tuesday.  ""I had a number of conversations with people over the last 24 hours,” Armstrong said, “And there's reasons why [Coinbase acquiring FTX] would not make sense, and we're not quite at liberty to share the details right now. I’m going to let other people share that if and when they’re ready ... it'll probably all come out eventually.""  See also: The Story of Sam Bankman-Fried's Backroom Deal With | Opinion  At a moment of great uncertainty, it’s risky to read too much into those sorts of tea leaves. But Armstrong certainly seems to know something the rest of us don’t. Just before publication of this story, it also became apparent that Binance may pull its buyout offer off the table after less than 24 hours of reviewing FTX’s balance sheet.  The nightmare scenario would be that FTX has been using customer funds for trading or other speculative activities – possibly including loans to sister company Alameda Research – and lost funds in the process.  For now, it’s unclear whether FTX is facing Celsius-style insolvency – an uncoverable debt at the level of its entire balance sheet. But the swift movement to seek a bailout after just a few hours of liquidity crunch could be read as further evidence of deeper, and perhaps more insidious, problems.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH | BNB,David Z.

Some analysts speculated that the selling pressure on Bitcoin and Ethereum from FTX’s attempt to raise liquidity against impending insolvency caused this cascade of losses.

According to the Coinbase chief, that move will distance him from chances to acquire FTX U.S. Meanwhile, Binance has some connection with FTX since its deal with the exchange has not ended. Both firms need to do some settlements. The Coinbase CEO further stated that if the FTX/Binance deal falls through, FTX customers will incur losses, which is not good. How FTX Ordeal May Affect Crypto Regulation: Coinbase CEO It appears that FTX’s losses have become gains for Coinbase. According to Armstrong, Coinbase’s customer activities have increased since the news of the FTX issue.

Meanwhile, FTX is currently trading at $4.65, with a live market cap of$619,086,494 and a trading volume of $3,262,989,678. featured Image From Pixabay, Charts From Tradingview.com",NEGATIVE,FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB | FTT,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-giant-coinbase-not-interested-in-buying-ftx-u-s-coin-stock-plunges/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/3997162.jpeg

Ethereum Exchange Inflows Have Continued To Go Up During The Past Day As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the ETH derivative and spot exchange inflows are both still on the rise. The “exchange inflow” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Ethereum entering into the wallets of centralized exchanges. There are two versions of this metric, the first notes the inflows specifically going to derivative exchanges, and the other registers only those transfers that are moving to spot exchanges. Generally, a rise in the derivative inflows leads to higher volatility in the market, as it implies that new futures positions are opening up, and leverage is increasing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bloodbath Takes Crypto To New Bear Market Lows | BTCUSD November 8, 2022 Spikes in the spot inflows can have direct bearish effects on the price of the crypto as investors usually deposit to these exchanges for selling purposes. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in both the Ethereum exchange inflow indicators (7-day moving averages) over the past year: The 7-day MA values of the two metrics seem to have been pretty high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Ethereum exchange inflows (both types) spiked up just before the crash shook the market. In this latest drawdown in the price, the crypto has gone from $1.6k all the way down to just $1.2k over the last couple of days. The main spark behind this crash seems to have been the battle between FTX and Binance, which has come to an end with Binance moving to acquire FTX.

Rather, the indicators seem to be actually climbing up even more. This suggests that Ethereum is continuing to experience selling pressure, a sign that the current level may not be the bottom, and the crypto’s value might observe further decline in the coming hours. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price floats around $1.2k, down 21% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has dropped 8% in value.

42411061,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBVQc,1668008226,What EU Merger Regulators Have in Store for Binance’s FTX Buy,"The news that Binance is to buy FTX’s non-U.S. business is rocking crypto markets – not least as it emerges from revelations about shaky financials in Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire.  But it also heralds a shift in approach in the crypto world, which is potentially about to see its first large-scale merger and all the regulatory baggage that goes with it – assuming it goes ahead.  While many crypto companies have been small-scale startups or boutique firms, a merged organization could represent 80% of the crypto market, analysts at Bernstein said in a Tuesday report. That’s the kind of scale that normally makes competition enforcers worry about market dominance, or about how consumers could get ripped off via less choice and higher prices.  Merger regulators have tough powers to police corporate deals, and companies pay the price if they don’t play ball. Facebook, now Meta, had to surrender its purchase of animated image site GIPHY under pressure from U.K. regulators, and was fined 110 million euros ($110 million) by the European Union for providing misleading information ahead of its takeover of messaging service WhatsApp.  “You definitely would think that any merger between two big competitors is going to be closely scrutinized by the antitrust authorities,” James Webber, a partner in the antitrust practice of law firm Shearman & Sterling, told CoinDesk in an online interview. “That's one of the main things the antitrust regime is there to check.”  That review can cause a “very significant” delay to the deal that could last around 18 months, Webber said, as regulators comb over the details of the market. They'll look, for example, at whether having the two companies cease to be rivals could harm crypto investors looking to find the best deal.  That could be hurried up given the liquidity problems FTX is apparently facing, as delays could mean its customers will have an even rawer deal, Webber said.  “If the alternative is just to let it go bust and let the pieces fall where they fall, It's probably worse to allow that to happen than to allow a merger to happen,” he said. “That does play a role.”  Read more: Binance Is Strongly Leaning Toward Scrapping FTX Rescue Takeover After First Glance at Books: Source  Turnover  On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU’s antitrust authority, told CoinDesk it hadn’t been notified about the merger yet – though that wouldn’t normally be expected at this stage, where Binance has only expressed an intention to buy.  Normally, big companies would have to inform Brussels of the deal if their turnover within the bloc is over 250 million euros each. Measuring that threshold is unusually murky for companies which publish relatively few details of their affairs and have little physical presence – but there are tricks for the EU to get involved anyway, Webber explained.  “The EU will one way or the other be able to get jurisdiction over a transaction like this, even if the initial turnover would suggest that you don't,” Webber said.  Given that the binance.us and ftx.us sites are, in principle, carved out of the deal, Webber argues the EU and U.K. will be the main jurisdictions to watch. Because Binance claims it's available in over 100 different countries, antitrust specialist Thibault Schrepel says there could be many reviews involved.  Regulators could end up imposing conditions on the deal, such as demanding that Binance sell off certain business lines, according to Schrepel, who tweeted his take on the deal.  ""Agencies usually impose remedies when fewer competitors are left, and when markets are not as dynamic, but antitrust agencies also need to show teeth in what they consider to be a space where consumers need their protection,"" Schrepel, an associate professor at Amsterdam University said, adding that the review would set a crucial precedent about whether the world of crypto is a single market, or is comprised of several different ones.  A further question is whether the EU and other regulators can get their way if they want to force changes on a purely online business.  “You can fine them, but that just moves the problem to a different place,” Webber said. “It’s typically hard to enforce fines outside your jurisdiction, so that would be an issue.”  Historically, Binance has declined to say where its head office is, or even that it has one – but more recently, it has gained regulatory recognition in EU countries including Cyprus, France, Spain and Italy – something that may give the EU some grip over the merger.  Culture clash  The crypto world may be up for a culture clash, and a wake-up call, as it grapples with yet another area of regulation it has escaped so far.  Many crypto projects involve collaborating with others – and indeed, decentralization depends on it. Yet, a Monday tweet from FTX CEO Bankman-Fried said that he wanted to “work together for the ecosystem” with his rival Changpeng Zhao is exactly the kind of thing that raises eyebrows among antitrust regulators worried over competitors forming cartels.  Zhao will even have to be careful during the coming days as he pores over FTX’s books and checks there’s nothing in there that could sour the deal, Webber said.  “During the course of your due diligence, the information you learned about your competitor is very carefully protected” with “proper controls on the information that’s being shared,” Webber said, to ensure commercially sensitive data can’t be used if the merger is abandoned.

I am of the opinion that it has, and that HOOD at 8x sales with 56% of its market cap in net cash is cheap enough to buy. HOOD Stock Price HOOD initially spiked after releasing third quarter earnings results due to the surprise profit milestones. But those gains were viciously given up - and then more - on Tuesday, as the stock plunged 19% in a single session. Data by YCharts I last covered HOOD in August and the stock has declined 5% since then. That surprises me considering that HOOD has made meaningful progress towards boosting margins and sustainability amidst a difficult environment. What Is Happening With FTX? Before we dive into HOOD fundamentals, let’s first discuss the FTX Token. FTT-USD, the exchange token of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange, has plunged 80% in only a matter of days, as it was revealed that big investment holder Binance sold off its stake. That apparently led to a liquidity crunch at FTX, and Binance has opportunistically stepped in to acquire the company and provide much-needed liquidity. For an excellent overview of the situation, check out this article by fellow contributor Mike Fay. It is clear that in spite of the volatility already seen in the crypto-markets, there may be more volatility ahead for cryptocurrencies. Due to HOOD having significant exposure to cryptocurrency trading, it appears that its stock has borne the impact of that realization. Yet I expect cryptocurrency trading volumes to recover at some point, and HOOD profits from equity trading as well, not to mention that the company has shown real signs of fundamental improvement. While HOOD does have cryptocurrency exposure, the crash in FTT-USD does not appear something that should be bothering HOOD investors, especially at this valuation. HOOD Stock Key Metrics The third quarter saw net cumulative funded accounts remain stable at 22.9 million, but that isn’t the right metric because HOOD earns revenues mainly from fees. Instead, investors should focus on monthly active users (‘MAUs’) as HOOD profits most from active investors. MAUs declined sequentially for the 5th consecutive quarter. 2022 Q3 Presentation Yet there was reason for optimism. Assets under custody grew sequentially for the first time in 3 quarters, which may surprise some considering the great volatility in all asset classes. 2022 Q3 Presentation Critical to that strength was net deposit growth of $2.7 billion, as well as some improvement in average revenue per user. 2022 Q3 Presentation Is it too early to wonder if HOOD has gone through the worst of it, with remaining users representing more loyal and active customers? The fundamental signs point positively on that one. That strength helped net revenue decline only mildly YOY and grow sequentially. 2022 Q3 Presentation As expected, HOOD was a beneficiary from the rising interest rate environment as net interest revenues jumped. 2022 Q3 Presentation HOOD largely crumbled due to both valuation and deep operating losses, but the company surprisingly achieved positive adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, showing the realized progress from hard work on cost cutting. 2022 Q3 Presentation The $47 million in positive adjusted EBITDA was the first positive number in 5 quarters. 2022 Q3 Presentation On the conference call , management guided for the fourth quarter to see operating expenses prior to stock-based compensation increase slightly sequentially to up to $370 million, which would be $100 million below where they started the year. HOOD ended the quarter with $6.2 billion of cash and no corporate debt, meaning that net cash represents approximately 56% of the current market cap. 2022 Q3 Presentation Is HOOD Stock A Buy, Sell, Or Hold? HOOD got a lot of bad rap during the pandemic amidst the meme-stock craze, which is ironic because it itself became a meme stock. HOOD has been aggressive in rolling out new features. Even though HOOD has faced declining MAUs for many quarters now, it is crucial to remember that HOOD had been an innovative brokerage firm which was rapidly growing users heading into the pandemic. 2022 Q3 Presentation A bursting of the tech bubble and growing doubt regarding the company’s ability to survive amidst tough macro conditions and declining users has crushed the stock price. But after the tumble, HOOD is now trading at less than 8x sales. Seeking Alpha That is before accounting for the 56% net cash position. HOOD’s revenues are high margin, meaning that if the company can return to MAUs growth, then operating leverage should eventually lead to generous operating margins. I assume the company can achieve 30% net margins over the long term and return to 20% growth rates. Applying a 1.5x price to earnings growth ratio (‘PEG ratio’), I see fair value pegged at around 9x sales, representing ample upside after accounting for future years of growth and the net cash position. What are key risks? HOOD still faces the risk of regulatory intervention, though recent reports indicated that the SEC may allow payment-for-order-flow . Even if HOOD maintains positive adjusted EBITDA, ongoing equity-based compensation may still dilute shareholders in the meantime until the company reaches GAAP profitability. If my thesis for a recovery takes too long, then that dilution would ruin the party for shareholders. At the same time, it is arguable that the large net cash position helps to offset that risk, as it buys the company significant time to right the ship. Of course, if HOOD is never able to return to secular growth (execution risk), then the future trajectory of the stock price may be $0. As discussed with Best of Breed Growth Stocks subscribers, a diversified portfolio of beaten-down tech names may be the best way to take advantage of the tech crash . HOOD (in small quantities) fits right in such a basket, offering a high-risk high-reward opportunity in tech.",NEUTRAL,FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FTT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4555352-robinhood-ftx-token-plunges-80-percent-why-i-am-buying?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3997793.jpeg

Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX has taken the spotlight in recent days after rival Binance said it would offload its FTX Token ( FTT-USD ) holdings, the crypto issued by FTX, in a move that resulted in huge outflows from FTX. FTX's liquidity crunch created enough of a concern that it agreed to sell itself to Binance in a non-binding agreement. After the Binance-FTX news emerged, ""rumors have begun to emerge that Silvergate has a line of credit out to FTX, putting them at potential risk of credit exposure,"" Chiaverini, who views SI stock with an Outperform rating, wrote in a note to clients. Silvergate did not immediately respond to Seeking Alpha's request for comment. If the rumors are true, the exposure to FTX would likely be on the deposit side of Silvergate's ( SI ) balance sheet, and ""while there may be an increased risk of deposit outflows due to this news, we do not expect to see any credit losses,"" the note read. The potential Binance-FTX deal itself ""showcases one of the larger near-term headwinds for SI, as we believe the sentiment surrounding digital assets continues to erode as the economy seems headed toward a fairly certain recession,"" Wells Fargo analyst Jared Shaw wrote in a note. SA's Quant system warned investors towards the end of October that SI stock was at high risk of performing badly due to negative EPS revisions and decelerating momentum. Since that call, SI shares dropped 57% .

Zhao shared the memo on Twitter after the Financial Times initially reported on it.  FTX's near collapse has ""severely shaken"" confidence in the crypto industry and will see regulators ""scrutinize exchanges even more,"" Zhao wrote in the note.  ""Licenses around the globe will be harder to get,” he added.  The Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange FTX agreed to sell itself to the world's largest crypto exchange Tuesday after it faced a liquidity crisis, following concerns about the makeup of sister firm Alameda Research's balance sheet, first reported by CoinDesk on Nov. 2.  Binance initially responded to the report by selling all of its FTT tokens, the native coin of FTX, which hastened the widespread exodus of assets from the FTX platform.  In his Wednesday note, Zhao reminded staff not to trade FTT tokens as due diligence for the deal continues. He acknowledged that Binance continued to own FTT tokens but that as soon as he finished talking to Bankman-Fried on Tuesday, he told his team to stop selling its holdings of FTT.  “We need to hold ourselves to a higher standard than even in banks,” Zhao wrote.  Zhao also said in his staff note that Binance ""did not master plan this or anything related to it.""  ""It was less than 24 hours ago that SBF called me. And before that, I had very little knowledge of the internal state of things at FTX. I could do some mental calculations with our revenues to guess theirs, but it would never be very accurate,"" Zhao wrote.

TRM Labs will use the capital, which brought total funding up to $130 million, toward product development and hiring.  Other participants in the round included new investor Goldman Sachs and returning backers PayPal Ventures, Amex Ventures and Citi Ventures among others.  Regulatory turbulence and the increasing entry of traditional finance firms into crypto have driven investors toward blockchain intelligence firms. TRM rival CipherTrace was acquired by Mastercard in September, 2021; Chainanalysis raised $170 million in May at an $8.6 billion valuation.  “TRM has differentiated itself as the premier blockchain intelligence solution to the public and private sector, with a unique breadth of asset coverage, cross-chain analytics and level of product innovation,” said Thoma Bravo Principal Christine Kang in the press release. “In the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, TRM’s capabilities are ever more critical to helping organizations scale and adapt risk management needs.”  The firm's blockchain intelligence solutions are used by law enforcement agencies, regulators, banks and private companies to investigate and analyze crypto-related fraud and financial crimes. Customers include USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, the U.S. arm of crypto exchange FTX, the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  San Francisco-based TRM Labs launched in 2018 and has expanded across the U.K., Singapore, Australia, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates. The company said revenue has increased 490% year-over-year since launch, and the team has grown from four to more than 150 people.  TRM Labs last raised $60 million in a Series B round in December, 2021 led by investing giant Tiger Global.

Most crypto assets are moving to the south with little or no break. The bears are becoming too intense, and tension keeps increasing in the market. The fluctuations have triggered the leading crypto exchange Binance, to pursue sustainability. This new action came after the exchange announced its intent to acquire the FTX to ease its liquidity issues. Related Reading: These Solana Numbers May Scare Off SOL Investors – Here’s Why The CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), has actively noted the events in the Binance-FTX drama. Also, he took to Twitter to disclose some points regarding the drama. In a tweet today, CZ revealed that his firm made more funding on its insurance backing. According to the post, Binance increased its Security Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) to $1 billion equivalent. CZ reported that the move ensures the network’s safety against the market’s recent price fluctuation. In addition, the aim is to protect users by ensuring continuing operations regardless of market trends. Details Of Binance’s SAFU Further, the Binance CEO mentioned the detail of the two reserve accounts and their links. One of the accounts holds Binance Coin (BNB) token and the Binance stablecoin (BUSD) worth about $700 million. The second account comprises Bitcoin (BTC) tokens worth about $300 million. Reacting to the Twitter post, some people from the crypto community made their positions known to the CEO. Some applauded his initiative and unique leadership vision for the network’s security. One of the users mentioned that all crypto companies should emulate Binance to have a Security Asset Fund for Users (SAFU). However, some still question the fund’s reserve cap adequacy for users. In 2018, the Binance SAFU kicked off with a fund dedicated to backing up user holdings in critical situations. Further, the firm allocated 10% of the trading fee to the fund. Gradually, the fund kept growing and hit $1 billion for the first time in February this year. CZ Maintains Transparency In The Crypto Firm The CEO of Binance has maintained a transparent position in handling almost all the firm’s events. CZ stated that the company would deploy a system of Proof-of-Reserve using Merkle Trees. The aim is to achieve full transparency with the community. In addition, Merkle Trees enable the encoding of blockchain data through a more secure and efficient method. Related Reading: Crypto Market Liquidations Reach $830 Million, When Will It Stop Bleeding?

BNB’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. BNB’s price remains weak across all timeframes as the price trades slightly above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Previous weeks saw the price of Binance Coin (BNB) outperform Bitcoin (BTC). Most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including Binance Coin (BNB) rallying from a region of $300 to a high of $390, with many hoping the price of BNB would pull off a good price action to a region of $450. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market. BNB’s price is looking strong, with many questions about how long bulls will defend this region with the current market issue between Binance and FTX, creating a fear of uncertainty and doubt for most traders and investors. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: These Solana Numbers May Scare Off SOL Investors – Here’s Why Binance Coin (BNB) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The previous week saw many altcoins produced over 200% gains over the past 7 days of breaking out of their range-bound movement, as many believe more hope is returning to the crypto space. The new week has yet to look like the previous as the week has looked choked with FUD news leading to many altcoins being affected negatively in price as major coins have been struggling to stay afloat from what looks like a crypto purge. Still, the price of BNB has continued to look strong after breaking below its weekly high of $350, which has served as support after flipping the price, acting as a supply zone initially. The support formed at $300 has proven to be key to holding off the price from sell-offs. The price of BNB retesting the support at $300-$290 is not good for the market as this would weaken this region for bears to push the price lower. The price of BNB needs to rally off this region to look safe and avoid dropping below its weekly lows, as this would affect the general market sentiment. Weekly resistance for the price of BNB – $350. Weekly support for the price of BNB – $300-$290. Price Analysis Of BNB On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of BNB remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $290 support, holding off the price from trending lower after retesting this region on previous times, bouncing off to begin a rally to a region of $350. BNB’s price closed above $290 on the daily timeframe indicating there are more chances of BNB trending upwards to a region of $350 as the market continues to recover in the coming days. The price of BNB needs to rally to a region of $350 for the price to remain safe temporarily, leading to a relief rally. If the price of $300-$290 fails to hold bears, we could see the price going down to $250-$200. Daily resistance for the BNB price – $350. Daily support for the BNB price – $290.

The firm has now raised over $120 million in the past year. It offers a payment product that lets users buy cryptocurrencies inside any application or website, essentially the Web3 answer to services like PayPal (PYPL) or Stripe. Its customers include GameStop (GME), crypto-based fantasy sports company Sorare, play-to-earn online game Axie Infinity and Ledger, maker of hardware crypto wallets.  Ramp plans to use the capital to hire for a number of senior roles. It has about 70 open positions, which means its staff will number 200, co-founder and CEO Szymon Sypniewicz told CoinDesk in an email. The funding will also go toward adding local fiat currencies and payment methods as part of a global expansion.  “Local payment methods reduce friction and costs for lower-income regions, while being more intuitive and accessible for more people in the world,” Sypniewicz said. “This is particularly true in LatAm and Asia, both regions that have seen explosive crypto adoption, and that we consider our next strategic targets.”  As part of the investment, Mubadala Capital’s Frederic Lardieg has joined Ramp’s as a director, and Korelya Capital partner Paul Degueuse joined as an observer. Other investors in the round included Balderton Capital and Cogito Capital.  London-based Ramp was founded in 2018 by Sypniewicz and Przemek Kowalczyk, who is the product chief. Ramp said payment volumes have increased 240% year-over-year, and the number of unique users coming from integration partners rose by more than seven times.

Bitcoin and ether have declined by over 11% and 20% respectively, in the past 24 hours, catching many traders off guard. Meanwhile, futures tracking bitcoin and ether saw $390 million in losses due to liquidations in the past 24 hours. The turbulence emanated from concerns about FTX’s solvency following a report by CoinDesk detailing how its sister firm Alameda Research’s balance sheet was full of FTX's native token, FTT, causing a widespread exodus from the asset.  Crypto exchanges have been scrambling to publish their fund reserves to allay investors’ fears over contagion risks following FTX’s liquidity woes. In the past 24 hours, seven exchanges, including Binance, Huobi and OKX, have said they will publish their audited fund reserves to increase transparency. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao urged industry players to provide “proof of reserves” following the FTX debacle.  Stablecoin heavyweights Circle and Tether distanced themselves from FTX hoping to calm fears about the crypto exchange's sudden decline. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said that even though Circle and FTX hold small equity stakes in each other, Circle has never given any loans to FTX or received any FTT as collateral.

Solana’s native token, SOL, is trading in the red across all time frames, as reported by CoinGecko, lending credence to the bearish claims. When asked what a Binance deal for FTX meant for Solana, Ran Neuner of CNBC Crypto Trader and founder of Crypto Banter referred to SOL’s pricing issues. In a tweet, he said: “Solana [is] getting killed.” He claims that the market has only recently realized that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao “now owns 10% of the tokens and that he would prefer support the BNB chain than SOL.” This is a devastating blow to SOL investors and traders. November has gone down in history as one of the worst months ever for Solana investors. Solana getting killed. Market realizing that @cz_binance now owns 10% of the tokens and that he would rather support BNB chain than SOL. Also Solana just lost all the support and investment that FTX and @SBF_FTX were making in the ecosystem. — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) November 8, 2022 Based on figures by CoinMarketCap, the coin registered more than 20% in weekly decline. At Coingecko, SOL is down 37% in the last seven days. Chart: TradingView The Solana network did benefit from recent advancements on its network, but the market behavior of SOL over the past week has been very lackadaisical. Related Reading: Polygon Soars 13% In Last 7 Days As MATIC Bulls Work To Hit New Highs Negative Effects Of FTX On Solana In a related development, the FTX’s native token, FTT, has had its value drop across all time scales as well, and is currently trading at $4.058. Meanwhile, after being rejected at the $38.26 area, SOL is now trading in the red at the $17.52 range, reflecting the same downward shift, courtesy of the negative impact that FTT’s drop has brought along. Now, the charts also don’t look good for SOL buyers and sellers. A total turnaround of mood, as shown by the CMF signal, is only comparable to the market crash that occurred when Terra pulled the crypto market down. Image: The Independent Investors and traders are also receiving significant bear market indications from the RSI, making the current market environment considerably more precarious. Despite this, the crypto community is still on the fence regarding a bullish reversal as the crypto market cap plummeted after BTC and other tokens fell due to the FTX brouhaha. What Can Still Be Done As the coin is currently in freefall, SOL bulls can position themselves at the 23.60 Fibonacci retracement level, which can serve as a launchpad for a possible relief rally in the near future. However, even this potential support may remain hypothetical in the face of the ongoing drama between FTX and Binance. With the decline of the cryptocurrency market, all we can do is hope. The latest price crunch is fueled in part by a high institutional fear that another LUNA implosion might occur, and current investor sentiment reflects this anxiety in the form of panic selling on the cryptocurrency market, which exerts more downward pressure on SOL. As of this writing, SOL is trading at a new low of $16.55, which does not bode well for the coin’s investors and traders. If the opportunity presents itself, however, investors and traders can purchase the dip and potentially halt the current market decline.

In a statement, the firm also reported a third-quarter net loss of $68.1 million, compared with a $517.9 million profit in the same period last year, and said Damien Vanderwilt will step down as co-president in January.  The near-collapse of FTX, which on Tuesday agreed to sell itself to rival Binance following days of speculation that sister company Alameda Research faced a liquidity crisis, has “put a short term wrench” in the crypto industry, Novogratz said on Galaxy's earnings conference call. The firm is withdrawing $47.5 million of its exposure to the exchange.  While it's important to be “nimble and agile” in coming weeks, the industry has been able to digest multiple events and other scandals and remains resilient, Novogratz said. Crypto will eventually become correlated with the macroeconomy again and not be so event-driven, he said.  “​​In the short run, people are nervous,” he said, noting that Galaxy remains in a good position to navigate the current environment. Novogratz also called Galaxy’s stock, which fell as much as 22% to C$3.63 on Wednesday, “unbelievably cheap.”  Separately, co-President Chris Ferraro said Galaxy has no exposure to Alameda and no exposure to FTX's exchange token FTT as collateral for its lending business. The company's only direct exposure is through its FTX balances, which is “down dramatically” from a higher level.  Last week, CoinDesk reported that Galaxy Digital was planning to cut at least 20% of its global workforce, according to sources. Novogratz said on Wednesday's call that Galaxy elected to cut about 14%-15% of its headcount, citing costs. The job cuts were tough, but necessary, he added. Novogratz also said Galaxy is boosting its investment across the engineering, security, and legal divisions of the business.

42420791,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYH3l,1667996100,Vitalik Buterin’s New Ethereum Road Map Takes Aim at MEV and Censorship,"Ethereum was founded on a vague, albeit tightly held set of principles around financial freedom and credible neutrality. Recently, those principles have been tested.  As regulators and big-money players bid for a larger role in Ethereum’s “decentralized” ecosystem, the blockchain’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, shared an updated vision for the network on Saturday – augmenting a road map he shared last month to include a new development track focused on ameliorating the censorship of transactions and an exploitative bot-driven trading practice known as maximal extractable value (MEV).  Censorship and MEV have become more existential for Ethereum in recent months, with governments and sophisticated users challenging key safeguards meant to ensure the network’s neutrality – the idea that anyone using or building on the network is treated without bias.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  When the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) sanctioned addresses associated with the Ethereum-based Tornado Cash – effectively calling on the network’s operators to stop processing (i.e., start censoring) transactions linked with the program – it directly challenged the idea that blockchains like Ethereum, which are supposedly operated in a decentralized manner, cannot be tamed by central authorities.  As for the scourge of MEV, the practice covers a mishmash of behavior but boils down to strategically ignoring, re-ordering or poaching transactions added to a blockchain – screwing over the person who originally placed a trade.  By formalizing an approach to these problems in a standalone section of Ethereum’s road map, Buterin is seemingly reminding the crypto community that MEV problems and censorship risks should be addressable – at least in part – by routine updates to the blockchain’s code.  Read more: What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value? - Ethereum  A new road map  Buterin’s road map is divided into six development “tracks” that are all progressing in parallel, each track containing a hodgepodge of proposed upgrades for the blockchain’s core code.  Ethereum’s first track, “The Merge,” reached a key milestone in September when the network shifted to a proof-of-stake system, abandoning the significantly more energy-intensive proof-of-work system trailblazed by Bitcoin.  Slotted between the speed-focused second track, “The Surge,” and the efficiency-focused fourth track, “The Verge” (which also saw significant revisions with the new road map) is a new track: “The Scourge.”  The goal of the Scourge, according to Buterin’s new road map, is to “ensure reliable and credibly neutral transaction inclusion and avoid centralization and other protocol risks from MEV.”  Censorship and MEV  Since the U.S. Treasury Department sanctions against Tornado Cash were announced over the summer, more than 51% of the validators that write and approve transactions on the network have begun ignoring those associated with the program, which is used to obscure where crypto is being sent to and from.  For many crypto developers and enthusiasts, that’s censorship, and so anathema to their goals.  Tornado transactions can still make it onto Ethereum, but they do so at a delayed rate relative to typical transactions. If enough validators refuse to process Tornado Cash transactions for fear of upsetting regulators, those transactions could, in theory, be censored from the chain entirely.  Also at risk of jeopardizing Ethereum’s neutrality is MEV – extra profit that validators operating the network can earn by re-ordering the transactions that they add to the network. The opportunity to extract MEV exists as a quirk of how blockchains like Ethereum operate, whereby the validators that run the network can effectively preview pending transactions from other users before they are finalized.  Though MEV may add some baked-in incentives to Ethereum that help the network operate more efficiently, it can also harm users. For an example of how, look up “sandwich attacks,” whereby a validator profits off of advanced knowledge of a trade, ripping off other traders in doing so.  The Scourge  Though censorship and MEV pose major challenges to Ethereum, Buterin and other core contributors to the network say that their harms can be programmed away.  Included in the Scourge, one method for addressing censorship and MEV concerns is protocol-level proposer-builder separation (PBS).  Today, Ethereum’s validators are responsible for compiling transactions into blocks (building), as well as pitching those blocks out to other validators so they can be accepted onto Ethereum’s ledger (proposing).  PBS separates building and proposing into two distinct roles. As a result, validators should have less of an ability to directly censor or reorder transactions – both limiting the amount of exploitative MEV they can extract, and potentially reducing the ability (or necessity) for validators to censor transactions to comply with regulators.  Though PBS is not baked into Ethereum’s code, it is already the network’s status quo. Most validators today use “MEV-Boost,” software that pre-builds MEV-optimized blocks for validators so they can easily earn more for their work.  Flashbots, the research and development firm behind the software, apparently aims to make MEV extraction more equitable. It has been scrutinized, however, for contributing to Ethereum’s problem with centralization and censorship: anyone is allowed to build and deliver blocks through MEV-boost, but most validators opt to receive blocks pre-built by Flashbots itself, which censors out Tornado Cash transactions.  Buterin, to prevent block builders from censoring in the future, includes a proposal for “inclusion lists” in the Scourge track on his road map. Once PBS is built into Ethereum, this proposal would give proposers the ability to effectively demand that builders include certain types of transactions in their blocks.  The wider context  Ethereum’s open-source developer community is famously slow to implement big updates, and the release of a new road map should be viewed as much as a PR play from Buterin as a practical set of next steps.  Although Buterin’s updated road map includes myriad new additions outside of the new “Scourge” track, the introduction of an entirely new section focused on MEV and censorship shows how top-of-mind centralization has become for Ethereum in recent months. It shows that Buterin (and co.) are thinking deeply about some of the ecosystem’s most pressing headwinds – even as questions remain around whether regulations and community consensus may make them difficult to code away.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/09/vitalik-buterins-new-ethereum-roadmap-takes-aim-at-mev-and-censorship,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4cceef03d0942e53d5165bc702f8cc05f88f0c10-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Red Flag for Solana (SOL),"Following the FTT token, Solana (SOL) in particular is currently suffering a massive price slump. As a report revealed last week, the SOL token is one of the major assets on FTX’s balance sheet. If Binance pulls out of the FTX deal, it could mean a massive sell-off in SOL. Amid concerns about this scenario, the market already seems to be front-running. Over the past 24 hours, Solana (SOL) is down 36% and has slipped out of the top 10 by market capitalization. At press time, the SOL price recovered above the the major support at $18.53 which was established between April and June last year. However, SOL fell as low as $16.20 today, to a level not seen since March 2021. FTX holds about $1.2 billion in SOL tokens – $292 million in “unlocked SOL,” $863 million in “locked SOL,” and $41 million in “SOL collateral.” As some analysts warn, however, this impending doom could get even worse. A total of 18,775,348 SOL, the equivalent of about $330 million, will hit the market tomorrow. The reason for this is that in epoch 370 a total of those 18.77 million SOL can be de-staked and presumably dumped on the market.

Also Solana just lost all the support and investment that FTX and SBF were making in the ecosystem”, Neuner forecasted. Related Reading: Solana Plunges 12% – Is FTX Selling Its SOL To Defend FTT? Other Altcoins Which Could Be Doomed By Alameda But it’s not just Solana (SOL) that seems to be in big trouble. Analysts have compiled a list of all Alameda ERC20 tokens that could see a potential sell-off in the coming days. Since Binance CEO “CZ” will only bail out FTX if the deal goes through, all Alameda assets could pose a threat to their respective markets.

Robinhood Markets falls as FTX woes spill over to crypto What happened? V alued at $32B back in January, Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX received funding from the likes of BlackRock, SoftBank, Temasek, Tiger Global and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. However, under the surface, recent questions swirled about the balance sheet of sister trading house Alameda Research, resulting in an FTX liquidity crunch as customers pulled $6B worth of withdrawals over the past 72 hours. It's a stunning reversal of fortunes for one of the most popular exchanges in the industry, given the fact that FTX and Alameda bailed out several crypto players themselves this past summer, including BlockFi, Voyager Digital and Celsius. Flagging the apparent issues was Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, who said on Sunday that the rival exchange would liquidate its holdings of FTX's token called FTT ( FTT-USD ) due to unspecified ""recent revelations."" On Monday, Sam Bankman-Fried ""SBF"" dubbed the tweets ""false rumors"" and that FTX was ""fine,"" but apparently the exchange had too many of its assets wrapped up in FTT token. ""Unfortunately, I don't have a perfect answer for you, because the details are still being hashed out,"" SBF wrote in a reported email to investors. ""I'm sorry I didn't do better, and am going to do what I can to protect customer assets, and your investment."" Outlook: Is CZ's move aimed at propping up the crypto industry? Countering broader concerns about the asset class? Just a jab at SBF? Binance's agreement to buy FTX is non-binding, but in traditional crypto thought, it may want to consolidate during the crypto winter before things warm up again. In any event, there is a lot of explaining that'll be done in the coming days, which is likely to trigger another call from regulators who have been disturbed about the lack of guardrails in the freewheeling cryptoverse.

That's half the more than $500 million it had Oct. 1, according to data compiled by The Block. Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, fell just over 8% in the same period.  Alameda has come under scrutiny following a CoinDesk report last week that found its balance sheet was full of FTT, the native token of crypto exchange FTX. Both companies are owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, meaning the trading fund rested on a foundation largely made up of a coin invented by its sister company, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another cryptocurrency.  More than $150 million of Alameda's tokens are held in its Ethereum wallets, with 50% of that held in just one wallet. Another 13 addresses hold more than $1 million, and 19 contain $100,000. Some $75 million worth of tokens is held in decentralized finance (DeFi)-based wallets.  Crypto holdings over $1 million consist of stablecoins, ether, BitDAO (BIT) and FTT.  Alameda has debt of $3.6 million overall, the research shows.  Alameda supplied more than 6.9 million FTT tokens, worth $35 million at the time of this writing, to DeFi lending application Abracadabra. Another 4.6 million SUSHI, worth $6.11 million, is held on the DeFi exchange SushiSwap.  “She could withdraw and sell at any time,” Lookonchain said, referring to Alameda co-CEO Caroline Ellison.

ETH’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. ETH’s price remains weak across all timeframes as the price trades above the 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Previous weeks saw the price of Ethereum (ETH) and most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including the price of Ethereum (ETH) rallying from a region of $1,300 to a high of $1,600 with many hoping the price of ETH would pull off a good price action to a region of $2,000. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market. ETH’s price is looking weak with the current market issue between Binance and FTX, creating a fear of uncertainty and doubt for most traders and investors. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tumbles, Why Recovery Could Be Round The Corner Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The previous week saw many altcoins produced over 200% gains over the past 7 days of breaking out of their range-bound movement, as many believe more hope is returning to the crypto space. The new week has yet to kick in like the last as most altcoins, including ETH affected by the current state of the market as the price of ETH looks shaky, dropping off from their weekly highs. Still, the price of ETH has continued to look bearish after breaking below its weekly high of $1,450, which has served as a support and demand zone for months now, holding off the price from sell-offs. The price of ETH retesting the support at $1,200 is not good for the market as this would weaken this region for bears to push the price lower. The price of ETH needs to rally off this region to look safe and avoid dropping below its weekly lows, as this would affect the general market sentiment. If the price of $1,200 fails to hold, we could see the price of ETH retesting at $1,000 and lower. Weekly resistance for the price of ETH – $1,400. Weekly support for the price of ETH – $1,200-$900. Price Analysis Of ETH On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of ETH remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $1,200 support, holding off the price from trending lower after retesting this region on previous times, bouncing off to begin a rally to a region of $1,500. ETH’s price closed above $1,200 on the daily timeframe indicating there are more chances of ETH trending upwards as the market continues to recover in the coming days. The price of ETH needs to rally to a region of $1,450 for the price to remain safe temporarily, leading to a relief rally. If the price of $1,200 fails to hold bears, we could see the price going down to a region of $1,000-$900. Daily resistance for the ETH price – $1,450. Daily support for the ETH price – $1,200-$900.

Binance agreed to buy FTX on Tuesday after its rival suffered a liquidity crisis. Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.  Read more: FTX Agrees to Sell Itself to Rival Binance Amid Liquidity Scare at Crypto Exchange  Bernstein notes that the FTX and Binance entities holding the non-U.S. business are offshore, but if FTX has investments in U.S. and European jurisdictions, it could give a reason for regulators in those regions to intervene.  “All eyes are immediately focused on the probability of the deal,” and any likelihood of it not completing is bearish for crypto markets, analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  Due diligence will take time and involve determining if there is a shortfall versus customer funds, the report said. Binance also must check to see if there are any “wrongdoings from diversion of customer funds to related parties or unauthorized purposes.”  If there’s a hole in FTX’s balance sheet, “Binance would acquire FTX as a fire sale, by making whole the customers,” the note said, and investors may raise legal questions about FTX’s conduct and about any potential wrongdoing.  Earlier this year, FTX investors bought in at valuations of $18 billion and $32 billion in two consecutive funding rounds. That could be an “extremely disastrous outcome for investors,” because of FTX's balance sheet situation, the note said.

In the past 24 hours, nine exchanges – Binance, Gate.io, KuCoin, Poloniex, Bitget, Huobi, OKX, Deribit and Bybit– have separately issued statements that they would publish their Merkle tree reserve certificates to increase transparency.  A Merkle tree is a data structure that is used in computer science applications. In bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies​, Merkle trees serve to encode blockchain data more efficiently and securely. They are also referred to as ""binary hash trees.""  In a centralized crypto exchange, every user’s assets are recorded by the ledger of a centralized database. The recorded assets in the database are the total amount of the user’s assets.  Using Merkle trees allows exchanges to store each user account’s hash value of assets in the “leaf nodes” of the Merkle tree. The second step is to audit those assets in the leaf node of the Merkle tree and verify all the users’ holdings by a third party.  Crypto exchange Binance founder Changpeng Zhao urged industry players to provide “proof of reserves” following Tuesday’s events involving FTX and Binance. Elsewhere, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun said Huobi, where Sun is a stakeholder and adviser, would conduct ""a third"" Merkle tree reserve test.  FTX came under scrutiny following a CoinDesk report last week that found the balance sheet of Alameda Research, a crypto trading unit owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, who also owns FTX, was full of FTX’s native FTT tokens. This meant that Alameda rested on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto.  The report sparked rumors of FTX becoming possibly insolvent, which in turn led to industry players selling FTX-linked coins to protect their own downside. Rival Binance, which held over $500 million of FTT on its books, started to offload its holdings – which culminated in a 24-hour-long drama that ended with Binance signing an intent to acquire FTX, which is now considered by many to be insolvent.  Stablecoin issuer Circle, which counts FTX as an investor, played down its exposure to the troubled exchange along with rival Tether and crypto exchange Coinbase.

BTC’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. BTC’s price remains weak across all timeframes as the price trades above the 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Previous weeks saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including the price of Bitcoin (BTC) rallying from a region of $19,200 to a high of $21,600 with many hoping the price of BTC would pull off a good price action to a region of $25,000. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market. Bitcoin (BTC) is looking too weak as the week has continued to look unprecedented, with the current market looking choked with the current issue between Binance and FTX, creating a fear of uncertainty and doubt for most traders and investors. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Takes Major Hit, Why The Bears Are Not Done Yet Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The previous week saw many altcoins produced over 200% gains over the past 7 days of breaking out of their range-bound movement, as many believe more hope is returning to the crypto space. The new week hasn’t kicked in like the last as most altcoins, including BTC, have all begun to look shaky, dropping off from their weekly highs, including the price of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) suffering a major price retracement back to a region of $1,300 and $18,000 respectively. Still, the price of BTC has looked after breaking below its previous all-time high that has continued to serve as a support and demand zone for months now, holding off the price from sell-offs. The price of BTC retesting the support at $18,000 is not good for the market as this would weaken this region for bears to push the price lower. The price of BTC needs to rally off this region to look safe and avoid dropping below its weekly lows, as this would affect the general market sentiment. Weekly resistance for the price of BTC – $19,500. Weekly support for the price of BTC – $18,000 – $16,000. Price Analysis Of BTC On The Daily (1D) Chart The BTC price remains weak in the daily timeframe as price trades below $18,500, holding off the price from trending lower after retesting this region on previous times, bouncing off to begin a rally to a region of $19,500. BTC’s price closed below $18,500 on the daily timeframe indicating there are more chances of BTC trending downwards as the market continues to be in doubt. The price of BTC needs to rally to a region of $19,500 for the price to remain safe temporarily, leading to a relief rally. Daily resistance for the BTC price – $18,500-$19,500.

42388747,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRRMqH,1667980976,'Long' Crypto Traders Take on $700M in Losses as Markets Falls on FTX Contagion Fears,"Total crypto market capitalization slid to $900 billion from over $1 trillion on Wednesday morning as traders reacted to speculations around prominent exchange FTX’s liquidity issues. Over $700 million in long positions, or bets for higher prices, was liquidated in the past 24 hours as traders were caught on the wrong footing.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) each declined more than 8% in the past 24 hours to reach levels previously seen in October 2020, putting a gradual recovery on hold. Other crypto majors like XRP, dogecoin (DOGE) and cardano (ADA) slipped over 12%, while solana (SOL) – of which Sam Bankman-Fried is a prominent backer – dropped 25%.  Futures tracking bitcoin and ether saw a cumulative $390 million loss due to liquidations, while SOL futures saw $40 million liquidated. FTT futures had a relatively lesser $27 million in liquidations – implying the steep drop was mostly driven by sales of spot tokens.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position because of a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  FTX came under scrutiny following a CoinDesk report last week that found the balance sheet of Alameda Research, a crypto trading unit owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, who also owns FTX, was full of FTX’s native FTT tokens. This meant that Alameda rested on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto.  The report sparked rumors of FTX becoming possibly insolvent, which in turn led to industry players selling FTX-linked coins to protect their own downside. Rival Binance, which held over $500 million of FTT on its books, started to offload its holdings – which culminated in a 24-hour-long drama that ended with Binance signing an intent to acquire FTX, which is now considered by many to be insolvent.  Such market dynamics spooked crypto markets as traders reacted to possible contagion risks.

BNB must stay above the $300 support to start a fresh increase. Binance coin price started a major decline from the $360 resistance zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $300 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There was a break below a major bullish trend line with support near $338 on the 4-hours chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $300 support zone. Binance Coin Price Revisits Key Support After forming a base above the $280 level, BNB price started a strong increase. The price climbed above the $300 and $335 resistance levels. The price gained pace after it broke the $350 barrier and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). Finally, it spiked above the $360 level and formed a new monthly high at $361. Recently, FTX’s drama and collapse dragged the market lower, including ethereum, bitcoin and ripple. There was a major decline below the $345 and $335 support levels. The price even spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $264 swing low to $361 high. Besides, there was a break below a major bullish trend line with support near $338 on the 4-hours chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now consolidating above $300 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). An initial support is near the $312 level. Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com The first major support is near the $300 level. It is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $264 swing low to $361 high. The next major support is near the $286 level. If there is a downside break below the $286 support, there could be an extended decline towards the $260 support. Fresh Increase in BNB? If BNB fails remains stable above $312 or $300, it could start a fresh increase. On the upside, the $330 and $338 levels are immediate hurdles. The next major resistance is near the $345 level, above which the price is likely to aim a test of the $365 level in the near term. Any more gains might send the price towards the $380 level. Technical Indicators 4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone. 4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level.

3984686,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=509980,1667978661,Coin Metrics Analyst: “FTX Might Have Provided Massive Bailout For Alameda In Q2”,"Did this Coin Metrics analyst uncover the key to the whole Alameda/ FTX story? Because let’s face it, it doesn’t make sense. Both of Sam Bankman-Fried’s businesses were extremely profitable. FTX was the world’s third-biggest exchange and growing, why would anyone risk killing that golden goose? There must have been an underlying cause. Did this Coin Metrics analyst uncover it in the on-chain data? He might have. Related Reading: Solana Plunges 12% – Is FTX Selling Its SOL To Defend FTT? The Head of R&D at Coin Metrics, Lucas Nuzzi, ends his thread with a warning: “Important to note that this is my own personal highly-speculative take on what happened based on these on-chain artifacts.” The case the Coin Metrics analyst is making rests on solid on-chain data, but the interpretation of what said data means is “highly-speculative.” So, take it with a grain of salt and don’t go around saying this is exactly what happened, because it might not be. That being said, yikes! The Coin Metrics Analyst Makes The Case Lucas Nuzzi starts with a statement of fact, “I found evidence that FTX might have provided a massive bailout for Alameda in Q2 which now came back to haunt them.” And then, he poses a mystery. “40 days ago, 173 million FTT tokens worth over 4B USD became active on-chain.” Where did those tokens go? You guessed it, Alameda Research. The day was September 28th. A record-breaking $8.6B in FTT moved that day. 2/ That day, September 28, over 8.6 Billion USD worth of FTT was moved on-chain. That was by far the largest daily move of FTT in the token's existence and one of the largest ERC20 daily moves we ever recorded at Coin Metrics. pic.twitter.com/GnUO1ZcCB7 — Lucas Nuzzi (@LucasNuzzi) November 8, 2022 “That was by far the largest daily move of FTT in the token’s existence and one of the largest ERC20 daily moves we ever recorded at Coin Metrics,” Nuzzi tweeted. What was happening around Alameda and FTX near that time? Nothing special, really. On August 24th, Sam Trabucco stepped down from the Co-CEO position at Alameda Research. “I will stay on as an advisor, but otherwise will not continue to have a strong day-to-day presence at the company,” Trabucco tweeted. On September 27th, Brett Harrison stepped down from the CEO position at FTX. “Over the next few months I’ll be transferring my responsibilities and moving into an advisory role at the company,” Harrison tweeted. This one is the kicker. On September 28th, Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted, “Heads up: rotating a few FTX wallets today (mostly non-circulating); we do this periodically. Might be a few more coming, won’t have any effect.” If all of this is true, that last SBF tweet will probably make an appearance in court. FTT price chart for 11/09/2022 on FTX | Source: FTT/USD on TradingView.com So, What Did Alameda Do With The Money? Believe it or not, the FTT tokens came directly from the original ICO smart contract. The Coin Metrics analyst “found a peculiar transaction that interacted with a contract from the FTT ICO. This 2019 contract *automatically* released 173 Million FTT from the token’s ICO.” Strange, but both organizations are joined at the hip. There might’ve been legitimate reasons. Then, things took a bizarre turn. “Alameda then sent that *entire* balance to the address of the deployer (creator) of the FTT ERC20, which is controlled by someone at FTX.” WHAT? 4/ The recipient of the $4.19 B USD worth of FTT tokens was no one but Alameda Research! So what? Alameda and FTX were intrinsically connected from day 1 and Alameda obviously participated in the FTX ICO. But what happened next was interesting… — Lucas Nuzzi (@LucasNuzzi) November 8, 2022 The Coin Metrics Analyst’s Theory According to Lucas Nuzzi, Alameda Research wasn’t immune to the crypto contagion that plagued the space in Q2. In fact, the company might’ve blown up with 3AC, Voyager, and Celsius. “It ONLY survived because it was able to secure funding from FTX using as “collateral” the 172M FTT that was guaranteed to vest 4 months later.” That’s an extremely risky move. It almost seems like FTX didn’t have a choice. 8/ The Alameda bailout likely put a dent on FTXs balance sheet to the point where it was no longer solvent. This would have been fine if the price of FTT didn't collapse and a bank run ensued This is why Alameda tried their best to protect FTT's price.https://t.co/nX1tphjLNR — Lucas Nuzzi (@LucasNuzzi) November 8, 2022 They didn’t, because “the FTT ICO contract vests automatically. Had FTX let Alameda implode in May, their collapse would have ensured the subsequent liquidation of all FTT tokens vested in September.” If the scenario the Coin Metrics analyst poses is real, SBF and company had to do it. And they paid a heavy price for it. “The Alameda bailout likely put a dent on FTXs balance sheet to the point where it was no longer solvent. This would have been fine if the price of FTT didn’t collapse and a bank run ensued.” Related Reading: The Binance Vs. FTX War: Here Are The Most Recent Stats & On-Chain Data This Is Where CZ And Binance Come In In this scenario, CZ And Binance somehow found out about the deal. And the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume had a heavy FTT bag. “As part of Binance’s exit from FTX equity last year, Binance received roughly $2.1 billion USD equivalent in cash (BUSD and FTT),” CZ tweeted when he announced they were liquidating their position. What did this heavy FTT bag mean? The Coin Metrics analyst explains, “As large holders of FTT, they could start deliberately tanking that market to force FTX to face a liquidity crunch.” And they did. And then, Binance offered to buy FTX and relieve them of their problems. Presumably for pennies on the dollar. A master stroke by CZ and team, if true. But remember the Coin Metrics’ analyst warning, “Important to note that this is my own personal highly-speculative take on what happened based on these on-chain artifacts.” Don’t go around saying this is exactly what happened, because it might not be.

Across all time frames examined by CoinGecko, MATIC has been on the rise, with the monthly time frame revealing the most increase (41.9%). The crypto has been able to mount a decent rally, climbing 13% in the last seven days. But, there’s a lot of higher ground to cover. The token’s current trading price of $1.05 which is below its opening price of $1.30, indicates that it was strongly rejected at that level. Since the MATIC token’s Stoch RSI values have recently been trending down from the overbought side, this poses a substantial risk to bulls. Will MATIC be able to maintain its stability or will it eventually fail? Related Reading: Tron Transaction Volume Balloons To 5.3 Million In Q3, But There’s Still Doubts Ahead Large Correction Forms For Polygon After starting its climb in late October, the token is currently in its correction stage after a protracted wick rejection on the $1.3075 price level. While the Stoch RSI values are falling, the CMF index is trending higher, giving the bulls a boost. Rallies like the one MATIC is in are, however, susceptible to corrections, which often occur after the asset achieves a rejection. Lower time frames, however, show that MATIC is stabilizing above the $1.1241 support level. The bull-bear strength indicator is currently on the bears’ side and is in direct opposition to the CMF indicator. If MATIC breaches the range of support at $1.1241, the bulls can stabilize the price around $0.9367, which still supports MATIC’s path to further highs. As Polygon becomes increasingly connected with traditional financial institutions, investors and traders should monitor macroeconomic developments. Related Reading: SushiSwap Suffers Monthly Drop In TVL – How Will SUSHI Perform This November? MATIC Performance On The Crosshair As MATIC reaches new heights and its engagement in the traditional financial sector becomes more obvious, its performance in the next days will reflect this development. As institutions look to Polygon as a gateway to Web3 and DeFi, the stabilization of the token above the 23.60 Fib retracement line could be a stimulus for further rally. This could be the beginning of a new age for Polygon, as the increased institutional interest in Web3 technology and DeFi will bring in new investors and traders. But for the time being, MATIC investors and traders should prepare for the continuing corrective period and avoid becoming greedy, as this could result in another market decline. This price fluctuation also disrupted MATIC’s link with Bitcoin, which is excellent news given that BTC is trading at a loss. We should anticipate more highs and lows for MATIC in the coming days.

42411065,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBVh9,1667970000,Dubai Presses for Crypto Companies to Set Up Shop,"Dubai is heavily recruiting crypto companies to establish themselves there, but the Middle Eastern nation isn’t quite ready for them. Regulations aren’t clear yet, and getting something as basic as a bank account isn’t a smooth process – at least for now.  Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), a dedicated regulator for the industry, hasn't yet released a comprehensive regulatory framework that companies can use to create or launch products, but officials have assured local companies that it will come by the end of the year, two people told CoinDesk. The regulator, established just seven months ago, has previously issued some guidelines on marketing and advertising for virtual assets.  Wealth funds in the wider region, the greater United Arab Emirates, are investing in crypto, and a large number of funds already reside in Dubai. Companies are hopeful that VARA will be friendlier to them than other jurisdictions where licensing can be slow. After all, the city is already a center for business tourism. It’s often praised for its low tax rate, its location near talent hubs like India and Pakistan, and the ease of obtaining visas for staff.  The city’s making a play to welcome the crypto industry. It stated its intentions to become a top metaverse economy and create 40,000 virtual jobs. At the same time, the UAE is working to get off the gray list of the Paris-based financial watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force. While it beefs up its anti-money laundering regime, it’s under increased monitoring.  Pre-regulation periods make lawyers wary.  “How can you be optimistic about something you haven’t read?” Irina Heaver, partner of Blockchain and Digital Assets at Keystone Law Dubai said. Before she sees VARA’s regulation and its applications, she’s establishing her clients elsewhere, she said.  Without regulation, less savory elements of the crypto industry have moved to the city, including YouTubers shilling altcoins to their audiences and other projects carrying out scams or rug pulls. The UAE has numerous free zones, which Heaver said makes it “easy to navigate and hide, unfortunately.” She’d like to see the industry cleaned up.  VARA has already handed out MVP (minimum viable product) licenses to some of crypto’s biggest exchanges. Notably, Binance, which has withdrawn applications in other jurisdictions, received an MVP license in September.  The license allows exchanges to offer a ""full suite"" of services, including spot, leverage and futures. There are some excluded services, such as crypto loans offered by exchanges.  The regulator is actively courting companies. James Bernard, founding partner of consultancy JBLV and founding member of the Dubai Global Blockchain Council told CoinDesk that VARA is “inviting some of the top companies around the world to be part of its MVP,” he said, whether that be exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible token (NFT) projects. “VARA will start discussion groups that will look to create the best practice in regulations of oversight for each of those verticals,” Bernard said.  VARA was established in a law issued by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai’s ruler.  Industry representatives pointed to the significance of creating a regulatory authority just for virtual assets.  “It’s the first government to regulate crypto under a new regulatory body solely for crypto,” Talal Tabbaa, CEO of CoinMENA said, adding that he was “super bullish” on the regulator.  According to Mohammad Hans Dastmaltchi, chairman of FTX MENA, many other regulators have tried to fit virtual assets into traditional regulatory models.  “[VARA] understands the business, but they’re also extremely tough,” he said.  OKX global government relations officer Tim Byun agrees.  “They really want to hear what the issues are and how they can be solved,” Byun said. For him, “the big elephant in the room for the entire crypto exchanges industry is the FATF travel rule.”  Discussions currently revolve around issues like whether technologies are compatible.  “Not all [virtual asset service providers] are equal,” Byun said. He said that centralized exchanges need to be careful about who they are sending information to. In his view, regulators could take a more proactive stance by starting locally and having exchanges send information between each other.  Banks not on board yet  Crypto companies may find support from the regulator, but it’s taking longer for them to find acceptance with traditional players. Opening bank accounts has proven difficult.  “Some exchanges have obtained non-objection letters saying that they can operate bank accounts, but they have insane restrictions,” Tabbaa said.  Applicants may find they can only open accounts in the local currency of UAE dirham and cannot accept other currencies. That, or they can only serve professional investors and not retail customers.  Banks may be waiting for the central bank to clearly signal that the crypto industry is above-board, Tabbaa said.  Crypto companies know that they are seen as high-risk.  “It is a new industry coming into the region,” said Balsam Danhach, head of operations for FTX MENA. “It’s not regulated. The appetite of a bank to take on that risk is very low.”  Tabbaa said the cost-benefit analysis for banks may not help, pointing to the possible revenues banks can generate compared to the liabilities of serving crypto companies.  Banking infrastructure in the region hasn’t been designed to be friendly for entrepreneurs, according to common industry criticism.  “Any entrepreneur in the region will comment that banking here is bad,” Heaver said. She explained that banking in Dubai is set up for multinationals. The banks are for-profit. They’re not making billions on letters of credit or trade financing arrangements from entrepreneurs.  Heaver knows of a few banks in the region who are looking into selling crypto to their existing clients.  “So why would I facilitate my competitors?” she said of the reticence of banks to service crypto companies.  But change is afoot. Heaver told CoinDesk she is working with a jurisdiction within the region and its main bank to offer bank accounts to crypto companies. If crypto companies meet the criteria set, they may be able to open bank accounts speedily.  Danhach said the central bank in the UAE was in communication with the other banks there.  “If I look at the past nine months, and then I take the past two months, it has been a lot easier to communicate with banks,” he said. He describes it as a work-in-progress.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/09/dubai-presses-for-crypto-companies-to-set-up-shop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29a99079c4bc2f6665cf105a7039d255725f5d49-2133x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ETH broke a major support near the $1,500 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The recent decline in FTT and SOL dragged the market lower, including bitcoin.

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,320 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next major resistance is near the $1,340 level. A clear break above the $1,340 resistance could set the pace for a decent increase. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price could rise to the $1,400 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,580 swing high to $1,221 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1,500 resistance zone. More Losses in ETH?

It is Election Day in the U.S., and that was going to be my main focus today, up until about 11:05 a.m. ET anyway. That’s the point when Sam Bankman-Fried announced that his company FTX would enter a “transaction” with Binance, which Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao later clarified was a letter of intent for Binance to acquire FTX.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  The fall of an empire  The narrative  WELL, today has been a day. I had a whole election thing planned, but we’re not going to know what’s happening for a while anyway – so instead, I’m going to refer you to the links below to catch up on today’s news. CoinDesk will have a live-blog kicking off at about 8:00 p.m. ET to monitor for major moves and results.  Why it matters  FTX was a huge player. According to CoinGecko, as of this morning FTX was the fourth-largest exchange by volume. Sam Bankman-Fried was a huge donor during the midterm elections and was a leading voice on some legislation. He might still be, but his company going from being “fine” to signing a letter of intent with Binance over the course of two days might have some long-term ramifications. We’ll have more on this in the coming days, but for now catch up on the last … week? the last week of this chaos here.  Breaking it down  This whole thing started last week when my colleague Ian Allison reported that Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Bankman-Fried and tied to FTX, held a remarkable number of FTT tokens on its balance sheet. FTT is the token issued by FTX.  Here’s what happened next:  Binance to Sell Rest of FTX Token Holdings as Alameda CEO Defends Firm's Financial Condition  FTT-Alameda Drama Weighs on Market as Asia Begins Its Week  Open Interest in FTT Futures Doubles as Binance Moves to Liquidate FTX Token Holdings  Solana Falls and Speculation Centers on Links to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, Alameda  FTX/Alameda Questions Hold the Spotlight as US Midterm Election, Inflation Data Loom  FTX Token Plummets on Withdrawal Concerns, as Contagion Hits Broader Crypto Markets  Bitcoin, Ether Slide as Protective Puts Draw Demand Amid Sell-Off in FTX's Token  Abracadabra's MIM Stablecoin Briefly Lost Dollar Peg as FTX's FTT Token Tanked  FTX's Bitcoin Balance Plunges to Just One  FTX Agrees to Sell Itself to Rival Binance Amid Liquidity Scare at Crypto Exchange  Bitcoin, Crypto-Linked Equities Resume Falling Despite Binance/FTX Deal  FTX, Binance Deal Draws Antitrust Concern  The Story of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Backroom Deal With Binance’s CZ  Alameda Thanked for ‘Prompt Response’ in Transferring $37M of BitDAO Tokens  FTX Token Falls 80% Despite Binance Bailout as Alameda Contagion Spreads to Bitcoin  Crypto Markets Take a Wild Ride Following Surprise Binance/FTX Deal  FTX Exchange Halts All Crypto Withdrawals  We’re going to need some time to figure out the implications. Bankman-Fried personally was a major donor this past election cycle (and sprung to prominence on the back of major donations in the 2020 election). A political action committee backed by Bankman-Fried is even rumored to be the next main super PAC to receive President Joe Biden’s blessing in the next election cycle.  There's also regulatory implications. FTX US Derivatives (formerly LedgerX) has a number of CFTC licenses, and FTX famously applied to try and settle derivatives directly, which the CFTC has yet to rule on.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Prices Plunge on Turbulent Day  By James Rubin  As earthquakes go, FTX's liquidity issues and proposed acquisition by Binance on Tuesday fell somewhere in the mid range – moderate damage to the industry's reputation and price declines that sent bitcoin and other major cryptos back to mid-October levels.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $18,400, a more than 11% decline over the last 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization last fell below $19,000 on Oct. 21. Ether was recently changing hands a little above $1,300, off more than 16% from Monday, same time. Other major altcoins sank by double digits to cap a turbulent day that saw crypto markets sink immediately following the Binance/FTX announcement, rise hopefully and then sink again as investors absorbed the rapid decline of one of the crypto industry's leading lights.  A version of this article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  FTX’s FTT token was trading at just below $6, a 74% decline during the past 24 hours. Solana's SOL, which had tumbled Monday on speculation that Bankman-Fried's trading firm, Alameda Research, might have to dump some of its holdings in a bid to raise liquidity, was off nearly 22%. Binance’s BNB token outperformed the market, but was still down about 4%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, recently fell just 0.5% but was down over 10% at one point.  “The FTT token will find it very hard if not impossible to recover while SOL and ecosystem tokens are likely to suffer losses too as trust appears to be eroded entirely,” wrote Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, in an email to CoinDesk, although he noted optimistically that “we don’t “expect bitcoin to face an extreme scenario. In fact, it could see increased inflows as market participants withdraw from riskier assets.”  “Either way, the sooner this gets resolved the better it is for the space, especially as it is likely to draw more attention from regulators,” DiPasquale wrote.  As U.S. voters went to the polls for midterm elections, stocks continued their momentum from Monday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose a few fractions of a percentage point, while the the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was up 1%. Safe haven gold also had another upbeat day, climbing 2.2%.  In an email, Marieke Fament, CEO of the NEAR Foundation, called said that ""consolidation is inevitable in crypto's current bear market,” but also saw FTX’s problems and the proposed acquisition as a potential learning experience.  “There's nowhere to hide during crypto winter – and developments such as the acquisition of FTX by Binance underscores the challenges and lack of transparency behind the scenes of some key players – which undermine the reputation of crypto,” Fament said. “Moving forward, the ecosystem is going to learn from these mistakes and hopefully create a stronger sector that puts honesty, transparency and consumer protection at the heart of their businesses.""

Sam Bankman-Fried, once thought of as the ""Warren Buffet"" of crypto, is set to vanish from his throne.  But will the deal go through? Right now it's only a non-binding letter of intent that is subject to Binance’s due diligence. The market, however, is giving it an almost even chance of failing.  Investors on Polymarket think there’s a 45% chance that Binance will pull out of the FTX deal and a 55% chance the deal goes through. Granted, the volume is small at $573 so the sample size is not large.  Polymarket ran similar contracts about the Elon Musk-Twitter takeover deal, asking if Musk would be the CEO of Twitter by Nov. 30. Given how much drama was involved in the deal, with Musk attempting to pull out of it, it looked like the “no” side was all but certain to win. Then things changed.  Remember that Binance’s deal for FTX doesn’t include Alameda Research, the market maker and investment fund which kicked off this crisis. So maybe the exchange will sail through due diligence, or maybe there are a few more skeletons in the closet.

42415044,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBWGym,1667957706,Liquidity Crunch Spreads to Crypto Lending as Institutional Borrowers Max Out Credit Pools,"Multiple institutional crypto capital firms maxed out their credit pools Tuesday on Clearpool, an uncollateralized lending protocol, as fear on the market mounts that crypto trading firm Alameda Research’s liquidity troubles might spread to crypto lenders.  Amber Group, Auros, and LedgerPrime received a “warning” label on their respective Polygon Permissionless Pools on Clearpool because they reached 99% of the maximum amount of credit available for them on the protocol. Folkvang and Nibbio also received “warning” status on their Ethereum Permissionless Pools.  These loans represent a total of $14.8 million debt, according to Clearpool’s loan dashboard.  By Wednesday, all five firms had paid off all or part of their debt and brought down their credit utilization to normal levels.  The reason behind the sudden high utilization level was that investors withdrew money from the credit pools, lowering the maximum amount of credit available, Amber Group told CoinDesk.  ""We have already paid down our outstanding loans on Clearpool due to the large amount of withdrawals,"" Elaine Wang, Amber Group's PR manager, told CoinDesk. ""Our loan size outstanding on Clearpool has been fairly consistent, and low, and when utilization spikes due to larger withdrawals, we will usually pay down a part of the loan to bring it back in line.""  Fears have mounted that Alameda Research’s deepening financial woes might potentially cause a liquidity crunch on the broader digital asset market similar to the Terra blockchain’s downfall or crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital’s blow-up earlier this year. Alameda is the sister company of ailing crypto exchange FTX, which rival exchange giant Binance agreed to bail out earlier Tuesday. Its balance sheet is loaded with FTT tokens that crashed 80% in a day.  Clearpool is a prominent uncollateralized lending protocol, where crypto trading firms often open credit lines and take out loans for their trading operations. Borrowers are not required to pledge assets in exchange, and the loans are secured by their reputation and alleged good financial standing.  In these types of crypto lending pools, interest rates are set dynamically depending on how much capital one takes out from the pool. As a borrower gets closer to the maximum limit of its credit line, the protocol penalizes by increasing the loan’s interest rate from the usual 8-10% to 20-25% annual percentage rate (APR).  On Clearpool, capital providers can withdrew their money anytime from the lending pools, reducing the available credit firms can tap. When withdrawals surge, credit pools' utilization levels may spike.  Taking out the maximum amount of debt from these DeFi protocols is the real-life equivalent of maxing out a credit card, and might signal broader financial distress on the market. In fear of a broader market rout caused by Alameda and FTX, creditors took evasive action and withdrew money available for borrowing, causing a liquidity crunch.  “Crypto lenders feel the credit crunch from the Alameda insolvency,” Walter Teng, vice president of digital assets at research firm Fundstrat, told CoinDesk.  Alameda’s DeFi debt  Alameda Research has been a diligent user of decentralized lending protocols, originating hundreds of millions in uncollateralized loans so far. Its current outstanding debt on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, however, is small compared to earlier this year, meaning fewer investor funds are in danger if Alameda defaults on the loans.  The trading firm took out two loans, a total of $5.5 million, from Apollo Capital and Compound Capital Management using Clearpool’s Permissioned Pool, according to Clearpool’s data dashboard.  It also borrowed $7.3 million from a TrueFi lending pool, which is due to mature Dec. 20, per TrueFi’s loan dashboard. The next interest payment is due on Nov. 20.  Lending pools on Maple Finance do not presently have active loans to Alameda, although Alameda had a lending pool that originated $288 million in loans until the spring of 2022.  This year, a series of crypto insolvencies have raised questions whether uncollateralized lending is viable in the young, volatile digital asset market. When an uncollateralized loan defaults, there aren’t any assets that creditors can reclaim immediately. The creditors only receive partial compensation from the protocols so they must resort to debt restructuring or go to court to recover their money.  “Unironically, the second instance of mass deleveraging across crypto highlights the need for transparency that DeFi offers,” Teng said.

42394113,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXmCz,1667957400,Midterm Elections 2022: Crypto Live Blog,"The U.S. votes for the House of Representatives and Senate on Tuesday, potentially setting the direction for the next two years of legislative and regulatory action.  The crypto industry has tried to play a major role in the election through donations, though results have been tempered at best. Despite that, a number of candidates with strong views on crypto are on the ballot, and whether or not they’re elected – as well as which party ends up controlling the House and the Senate – could well determine what sort of legislative priorities receive attention next year.  Despite their importance, the main story Tuesday was the surprise announcement by Sam Bankman-Fried, a major donor and the founder of trading firm FTX, and Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder of Binance, that the latter had signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire FTX.  The news came days after CoinDesk first reported that much of FTX sister firm Alameda Research’s balance sheet was composed of FTX’s own exchange token FTT, raising questions and concerns that the company may not have been as well-collateralized as it purported to be.  Prior to last week’s news, Bankman-Fried was a prominent face in Washington D.C, telling a banking conference last month that he spent much of his time talking to lawmakers and regulators. His influence may wane, given his company’s sudden decline, and legislative issues like the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, which he supported, may suddenly lose industry backing.  ND (12:10 a.m. ET): While a number of results have rolled in, it still seems to be far too early to tell whether Democrats retain control of both houses of Congress or if Republicans will take control of one or both bodies. As of midnight ET, the New York Times rated the Senate a tossup, and the House leaning Republican.  The crypto markets remained focused on the FTX/Alameda collapse, with few in the crypto industry focusing on midterms Tuesday. The market meltdown appears to have halted, at least for the moment. The price of major cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, BNB and XRP remained relatively steady over the past hour, in sharp contrast to downturns earlier in the day, according to CoinGecko.  The outlook for the crypto industry remains up in the air. A number of pro-crypto lawmakers have won their races, from both sides of the aisle. Many of the driving forces behind legislation that could move in the coming year have maintained their seats, and lawmakers from both parties seemed confident that legislation would move forward regardless of the political makeup of Congress.  The confounding factors might be the market itself. Bankman-Fried and FTX’s collapse will likely have a negative impact on how crypto is perceived in Washington. Indeed, two longtime supporters of crypto, Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry and Senator Cynthia Lummis, both argued that the collapse is a sign that the industry needs clearer regulation.  JH (11:38 p.m. ET): The son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson – Jonathan Jackson – is one of the few congressional candidates in this election to have openly advocated for cryptocurrency during his campaign. The Democrat was easily winning his Chicago district with 79% of the vote, so the crypto industry’s political-action committees can chalk up a victory there, having spent considerably to support his primary. In fact, they spent so much that Jackson had to issue a statement that said the crypto dollars were technically “independent expenditures” under campaign finance rules and therefore out of his hands.  ND (11:31 p.m. ET): New York Governor Kathy Hochul won reelection Tuesday night. Hochul has sat on a bill to prohibit new carbon-based crypto mining facilities for two years, which the state legislature passed earlier this year. She told reporters on numerous occasions that she was still reviewing the bill, but she hasn't expressed many other views on crypto.  JH (11:31 p.m. ET): Republican Markwayne Mullin, also a recipient of crypto largesse, was projected to win a full term in the Senate from Oklahoma with 62% of the vote. He won a primary to fill the seat earlier this year.  JH (11:22 p.m. ET): Democratic Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Richie Torres (D-N.Y.), members of the congressional blockchain caucus, were holding onto their seats with about 58% and more than 82% of the votes, respectively. Several other House candidates supported by the cryptocurrency industry also headed toward the winners’ circle Tuesday night, including Glenn Ivey, a Democrat who crushed his opponent in Maryland, and Republican Mark Alford, who sailed to a commanding victory in Missouri. And Missouri’s attorney general, Eric Schmitt, will be the next senator there, having been backed by one of the main industry PACs.  The industry may recall New York Democratic incumbent Rep. Nydia Velazquez, who held a hearing on blockchain technology and small businesses in 2020 (which didn’t seem to produce any particular congressional action). She’s winning re-election, so she’ll be expected to return to the House Financial Services Committee.  CL (10:40 p.m. ET) Republican J.D. Vance has an 8-point lead over his Democratic competitor, Tim Ryan, in the battle for retired Ohio Senator Rob Portman’s open seat. The New York Times is reporting Vance is “very likely” to win, with 82% of the votes in. Both Vance and Ryan have been vocal about their support for the cryptocurrency industry. The outgoing Portman was a key author of the bipartisan infrastructure law which contained a crypto tax provision the industry lobbied unsuccessfully to defeat.  ND (10:35 p.m. ET): Rep. Warren Davidson, a leading pro-crypto Republican, won reelection to the House of Representatives. Davidson was the author of the Token Taxonomy Act, an effort to create some legislative clarity around how cryptocurrencies could be regulated in the U.S.  ND (10:20 p.m. ET): The crypto markets have remained relatively steady over the past hour or so, a bit of a contrast from the rest of the day. Bitcoin’s price traded around $18,000, while ether traded around $1,300, down only 1 or 2% over the past hour, according to CoinGecko. While prices have been relatively calm since polls began closing, they’re still down heavily – at least 10% or more for some major cryptocurrencies – over the past day.  Markets were shocked early on Tuesday after Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao announced Binance could acquire FTX under a non-binding letter of intent. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, and neither was a timeline for when the deal might close.  Prediction markets are unsure whether the deal will actually close, giving CZ the same odds of closing as they are of the deal falling through.  CL (10:09 p.m. ET) The New York Times is predicting that former Republican Congressman Ted Budd will win the senate seat in North Carolina, beating his Democratic competitor, Cheri Beasley. 84% of votes are currently in, and Budd holds a three-point lead over Beasley. As a congressman, Budd was on the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and led the charge on several crypto-friendly policy initiatives.  ND (10:05 p.m. ET): Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, won reelection. Polis founded the Congressional Blockchain Caucus as a lawmaker in the House of Representatives, and has remained crypto-friendly during his terms as governor.  ND (9:55 p.m. ET): Rep. Patrick McHenry, the senior-most Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, won another term Tuesday night. The Congressman, who was one of the driving forces behind a highly-anticipated bill regulating stablecoins, is poised to take over the Financial Services Committee if Republicans take the House of Representatives.  JH (9:55 p.m. ET): Texas Democrat Jasmine Crockett, who was supported by an influx of crypto industry money during her primary race, was on track to easily win her seat. She represented a strategy the industry leaned on in its campaign giving this year, to focus on primaries in districts with dominant party majorities, taking the stress off their candidates’ need for support during the general election. Crockett had more than 76% of the vote at the halfway point.  CL (9:37 p.m. ET): Incumbent Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, looks primed to beat his Democratic opponent Beto O’Rourke. Though only 44% of votes are in, some outlets including Fox have already called the race in Abbott’s favor. Abbott has been a strong supporter of the crypto industry in Texas, where miners have flocked to take advantage of the state’s cheap electricity.  JH (9:33 p.m. ET): Some of the earliest East Coast states to close their polls started to hint at what all those talking heads have been talking about: The Republicans may find the momentum to seize the House.  The early results in district's like Virginia's 2nd and 7th were widely seen as bellwethers, and they both showed strong Republican numbers, though the final tallies are far from over. But other close battles, such as in Indiana’s 1st and Ohio's 1st, are so far seeing a strong start in the Democrats’ favor.  If the Republicans do win this majority, it means a new speaker of the House, of course, and also new committee chairmen – including for the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee. The former oversees the banking regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The latter oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These are the panels where a lot of the most important work is going to be done on bills that one day regulate cryptocurrencies in the U.S.  Fortunately for the crypto industry, digital assets oversight isn't yet one of those categories that sends Democrats and Republicans into their trenches. Even with the bullets flying next year, lawmakers may still find a path through this neutral territory to make crypto legislation happen.  ND (9:07 p.m. ET) The Associated Press projects that Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) won another term representing his district in the House of Representatives. Soto has long been a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, and reintroduced the Token Taxonomy Act alongside Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) last year.  ND (9:00 p.m. ET): The Associated Press and CNN are predicting that Katie Britt has won a Senate seat, representing Alabama (with 1% of precincts reporting in at press time). The Republican will succeed Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who famously blocked unanimous consent against an amendment to last year’s bipartisan infrastructure bill which would have modified a crypto tax provision.  Britt said she supports crypto, accepting bitcoin, ethereum and dogecoin for campaign donations and announcing her “staunch support” for the crypto ecosystem.  JH (8:47 p.m. ET): Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) is showing early hope for defending his young seat against his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker. This is one of the handful of U.S. Senate seats that can tip the 50-50 balance in that chamber, where Democrats have enjoyed their tie-breaking advantage.  Warnock had more than 50% of the vote with about 44% of the count complete, with Walker at 48%.  The Georgia incumbent is a member of both the Senate Banking Committee and the Agriculture Committee, which will probably be the two most important committees when it comes to the future of crypto regulations. However, Warnock hasn't yet been a major voice in digital-assets issues. He did sign on to a bill to make it harder for Russia to undermine sanctions by using cryptocurrencies.

42420799,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYHD3,1667952355,These Four Key Charts Shed Light on the FTX Exchange's Spectacular Collapse,"Speculation surrounding Sam Bankman Fried’s crypto exchange FTX grew so intense that the firm agreed to sell itself to bigger rival Binance. Blockchain data offers a fresh perspective on FTX’s liquidity crunch, illustrating how the drama escalated so quickly.  Top 10 FTX withdrawers for all wallets  Comprehending why Binance agreed to buy FTX today means understanding FTX’s liquidity woes.  One of the earliest red flags came from the top 10 addresses by withdrawal volume on FTX. These addresses, which include Nexo, Circle and Jump Trading, have withdrawn a whopping $1.87 billion in the past seven days, Nansen data suggests.  Nexo, a crypto lending platform that has more than five million users worldwide, as stated on the company’s homepage, has withdrawn more than $408 million worth of ether (ETH) from FTX. The blockchain explorer website Etherscan confirms Nansen’s data, with Nexo transferring ETH in large volumes through several transactions. Here are several Nexo transactions out of FTX with values of at least 4,999 ETH: Tx1, Tx2, Tx3, Tx4, Tx5, Tx6, Tx7, Tx8 and Tx9.  Market participants also have withdrawn $121 million USDC from FTX to Circle’s deposit contract address, data from Nansen and Etherscan suggests. (Nansen shows that $1.15 billion USDC has left Coinbase in the past 24 hours, reflecting of users taking tokens off exchanges.)  Data from Coinglass reveals that in the past 24 hours, the number of bitcoins on FTX dropped by 19,941.64 BTC to 36.14 as of press time.  Stablecoin outflow  Understanding the volatility stemming from the FTX drama continues with stablecoin outflows. According to Nansen data, in the past seven days starting on Monday, Nov. 7, FTX led all exchanges in stablecoin outflows. Some $451 million worth of stablecoins have left FTX, more than the combined outflows of KuCoin, Crypto.com and OKX.  Specifically, FTX’s holdings of USDC and USDT have nosedived dramatically. Between Friday, Nov. 4 and Tuesday, Nov. 8, Nansen data states that FTX’s USDC holdings dropped about $137 million, roughly 84%, while its USDT holdings dropped from $198 million to $68 million.  According to CryptoQuant, FTX’s stablecoin reserve stands at roughly $156 million currently, down more than 78% since Oct. 24.  FTX’s stablecoin reserve is at its lowest levels in a year. Some market participants have been concerned because one of the initial signs that foreshadowed the collapse of Terra Luna was when UST deposits on the Anchor lending protocol started dropping rapidly.  While the chart shows a large outflow of stablecoins from KuCoin, KuCoin’s net stablecoin change is actually zero. On Nov. 5, Kucoin conducted a simple swap of USDT between the Ethereum and Tron network. 300 million ERC-20 USDT left KuCoin, and 300 million TRC-20 USDT entered into KuCoin. The swap was “because of users’ demand” and was “not a decision related to FTX,” wrote KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu to CoinDesk via Twitter.  Nansen data only shows Ethereum-based stablecoins currently, excluding ones on the Tron network. According to data from CoinMetrics, 34.1 billion USDT is supplied on the Tron network, 1.8 billion more than the USDT supplied on Ethereum.  Top 10 'smart money' FTX withdrawals  Additionally, prolific and active cryptocurrency traders have been transferring their wealth out of FTX, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen. Over the last 24 hours, the top 10 withdrawal wallets categorized by Nansen as belonging to “smart money” have removed about $246.6 million worth of tokens.  Nansen considers a wallet to be “smart money” if it meets at least one of several test, including:  It is known to belong to an investment fund  It has made at least $100,000 by providing liquidity to the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, SushiSwap and Uniswap, excluding so-called impermanent loss  It is in the top 300 addresses ranked by realized profit, considering only on-chain trades that occurred on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)  Jump Trading, which focuses on ecosystem building, quant research and trading, has withdrawn $118 million, more than the next six addresses combined.  Other notable smart money withdrawals include asset management firm Arca and SBF’s trading firm Alameda Research. Alameda Research transferred 92 million BIT (roughly $35 million) out of FTX and into their own address.  FTT price and volume  The chart above shows the daily price and volume of the FTX exchange’s FTT token, which grants holders a discount on trading fees on the FTX marketplace. Following CoinDesk’s disclosure on Nov. 2, FTT recently slid roughly 79%, with its volume jumping dramatically.  The data in the chart only covers volume on the FTX exchange, so it may not cover the entire FTT trading volume across all exchanges. The chart shows that the recent revelations triggered a flurry of interest in the token and that the drop in FTT was accompanied by significant price discovery.  UPDATE (Nov. 9, 17:07:07 UTC): Updated with information in the second chart section about stablecoin outflow by clarifying KuCoin's net stablecoin change, added quotes from KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu elucidating Nansen's capabilities, including a statistic from CoinMetrics, and adding more context to the actual chart.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | USDT | BNB,Sage D.
