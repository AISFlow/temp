Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,874 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,705-$10,956  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price mostly traded around $10,800 Monday, after a rally at 00:00 UTC (8 p.m. ET Sunday) that pushed the world’s oldest cryptocurrency as high as $10,956 before losing steam. Bitcoin traded at $10,874 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Sets Record 63 Straight Days Closing Above $10,000      “In a sign of strength, bitcoin price has held above $10,000 for 63 days now,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for quant trading firm ExoAlpha. “This is the longest time since December 2017 to January 2018.”      “Also, we witnessed KuCoin getting hacked for $150 million this weekend but despite some chop on Saturday as news broke, bitcoin was broadly stable.”      Despite the bullish sentiment, not all traders think bitcoin can get past $11,000. “After the pause BTC took for the weekend, bitcoin is currently on a bullish impulse,” said Alessandro Andreotti, an Italian over-the-counter crypto trader. “It could easily surpass $11,000, but it could easily be a bear trap so we must be careful.”      “Bitcoin continues to range between $10,000 and $11,000 after dropping to $10,100 amidst equity and gold weakness in the past week,” said Cindy Leow, portfolio manager for quant firm 256 Capital Partners. “With quarter-end coming up, we might also see some BTC rebalancing or profit-taking happening amongst hedge funds this week.”      In the derivatives market, Leow points to the lack of overall activity there as a signal many investors are simply waiting out the market. Open interest in bitcoin futures, in particular, remains flat Monday.      The traditional markets are leading the way heading into the fourth quarter, Leow added. “In the short-term towards the quarter-end, our eyes are on macro movements to monitor any weaknesses which will inevitably flow into BTC and ETH.”    Ether options signal short-term volatility    The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Monday trading around $362 and climbing 2.3% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Uniswap Now Bigger Than Entire DeFi Industry Just Two Months Ago      Volatility skew is a measure options traders monitor for placing bets at various expirations. The one-month, 25-day volatility skew for ether has been in positive territory for most of September after closely following the 3-month and 6-month for the better part of the past three months, which suggest volatility in the near future.      256 Capital Partner’s Leow says DeFi has contributed to increasing short-term volatility in ether. “ETH has seen much more reflexive movement in September versus bitcoin, no doubt a result of being the base currency for many DeFi pairs which have had a volatile September,” she said.      Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, says this indicator signals options traders would have different strategies depending on expiration since short-term ether volatility is expected to continue. “This creates a distinct opportunity on calendar risk reversal spreads, and a part of this trade would naturally involve rich ETH puts in the short-term dates versus cheap ones in the long-term dates.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Monday.

42384813,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlPNr,1601323030,The Standard About to Revolutionize Payments,"What will payments over the internet look like in 2030?      A revolution in finance and payments. That's what crypto-based platforms like Bitcoin, decentralized finance and stablecoins are attempting to do. But just because traditional money is centralized around monolithic central banks doesn't mean that it can't have a revolution of its own.      Over the next 10 years, a big bang will be unfolding in central bank land. ISO 20022, a new standard for communicating electronic payments instructions between financial institutions, will be taking over. This, combined with the emergence of real-time central bank retail payment systems, means that payments in 2030 are going to be much better than in 2020.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and was a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog. This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series about the future of the crypto economy.    Anyone involved in anarchic finance may want to keep one eye on what the suits have planned for the next decade. Not everyone will be included in this centralized revolution. Decentralized options will be the go-to backup for many people.      We rarely notice standards, but they affect all parts of our daily life. Standards govern everything from screw thread spacing (ISO 68-1) to country codes (ISO 3166) to child seats (ISO 13216) to quality management (ISO 9000).      Settling on a uniform way of doing things makes life easier. Prior to the 1950s, for instance, international cargo shipping handling required a ""Tetris-like"" approach to dealing with diverse package sizes. It was expensive, dangerous and labor-intensive. Putting everything in a universal metal container made the cargo handling process go much more smoothly. The International Standards Organization, an international non-governmental technical body founded after World War II, helped the industry settle on a standard definition for shipping containers by creating ISO 338, ISO 790 and ISO 1897.      The principles that apply to shipping are equally applicable to payments and commerce. To avoid a cacophony of different payment requests and orders, it helps if everyone uses a common grammar. The payments community builds this grammar by agreeing ahead of time on a fixed way of formatting messages. Standard headers. Footers. Payee account number fields. Character limits.      Take the U.S. People usually pay their utility bills by making an automated clearinghouse (or ACH) payment. All parties to an ACH payment must agree to use the common grammar set out by the National Automated Clearing House Association, or NACHA, the not-for-profit organization that governs U.S. ACH systems. A typical NACHA message looks like this:      To the human eye, a NACHA-formatted message looks like gibberish. But there are many advantages to a standardized message format like this, including that it is readable by machines. And so all ACH payments can be automated from one end to the other. This reduces costs, processing times and errors. Without NACHA's standards, monetary chaos would result.      There are a number of local message standards in the U.S. The Federal Reserve, for instance, requires participants to use its own proprietary messaging format if they wish to make wire transfers via the Fedwire Funds Service. And so a U.S. bank, municipality, or corporation must be fluent in the financial grammars of both NACHA and the Fed.      This proliferation of messaging standards is a global phenomenon. The U.K.'s multiple payments systems each use a different one. The Faster Payments Service uses a modified version of ISO 8583, BACS (the U.K.'s ACH system) uses Standard-18, and CHAPS (its large value payment system) uses the SWIFT MT messaging format.      It is into this babel of standards that ISO 20022 is being ushered. The idea is to convert all existing payments systems from their own proprietary messaging standards over to ISO 20022. And so ISO 20022 will become the English of payments, a global lingua franca for transferring value electronically.      ISO 20022 isn't new. The ISO began to devise the standard in the early 2000s. In the 2010s, a few trailblazing nations shifted over to it from their domestic standards. The Chinese are the leaders, having converted their main payment systems to ISO 20022 in 2013.      But most countries have yet to make the shift. The U.S.' main large value payment system, Fedwire, was originally slated to start transitioning to ISO 20022 over a three-year period beginning in late 2020. But thanks in part to COVID-19, the start date has been pushed to at least 2022, which means that the final changeover won't be complete till 2025 or so. The European Central Bank's large value system, Target2, will start its transition in November 2022. The U.K. will switch in April 2022 in conjunction with a new real-time gross settlement system.      See also: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      Probably the most important piece of financial infrastructure to make the shift will be the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT. SWIFT operates the global messaging network that banks rely on for making international payments. It intends to begin the switch to ISO 20022 near the end of 2022. There will be a three year coexistence period in which ISO 20022 and SWIFT’s legacy MT messaging format can both be used. Only in November 2025 the legacy format will be turned off.      One of the big advantages of a universal payments language is that banks, businesses, governments and other actors can stop supporting multiple formats. Whether a payment is made in dollars over Fedwire, in renminbi via the People's Bank of China, or from euros to rand along SWIFT, a single unique payment standard will prevail. That's pretty neat.      When a payment gets passed on from one system to another, it has to get re-translated into that system's language. This means data loss. But with one universal standard, no data gets lost in translation.      ISO 20022 has some nice features of its own that other standards lack. To begin with, it can carry more data than other messaging standards. No more cramming information into the wrong fields and truncation of names and addresses. This means that fewer messages will be tagged by machines as requiring human intervention. With fewer repairs needed, the overall payment process will go faster, require less labour, and reduce costs.      ISO 20022 also allows for more precision. SWIFT asks us to imagine a payment sent to Cuba Sports Bar Grille in Louisiana. In the pre-ISO 20022 format, ""Cuba"" might mistakenly trip a sanctions filter. But with ISO 20022 the data is carefully structured such that the word Cuba is designated in the name field, and so won't get held up.    It will be tomorrow's unbanked who will be the natural customers of non-gated decentralized systems.    This standardization of global payments grammar is arriving at the same time that 24/7 instant retail payment systems are being introduced by central banks all over the world. Until recently, small payments to and from bank accounts were typically processed by central banks over a settlement window of two to three days. That central banks typically close at nights and on weekends only added to waiting time. Delays like this were fine in the 1950s, but modern consumers raised on a diet of instantaneous email and on-demand video expect much more from their bank accounts.      The U.K.'s Faster Payments scheme, introduced in 2007, was one of the first real-time retail payment systems. More upgrades came in the 2010s including Sweden's BiR, Singapore's FAST and India's IMPS. Canada's Real Time Rail will be in place in 2022 while the U.S.'s FedNow real-time system is slated to arrive in 2024.      By 2030, 24/7 real-time retail payments will be de rigueur not only in developed nations but also in developing nations in Africa, the Middle East and South America. And all of these blazing fast systems will have settled on one unified language, ISO 20022, which means lower costs, fewer errors and more automation. In short, centralized payments are going to get very, very good over the next few years.      Where do blockchains fit in all of this? In times past, blockchain advocates have pigeonholed centralized payments systems as archaic and clumsy. But tomorrow’s payments are unlikely to conform to these stereotypes.      See also: Paul Brody – How Small Business Can Achieve 'Economies of Scale' by 2030      Given this firming up of the center, blockchain-based platforms will have to find ways to innovate around the edges. In 2030, there will still be people who are excluded from the ISO 20022 real-time payments nirvana I’ve just described. There will be some who are frozen out because they are protesting their governments. This is happening in Belarus today. Or those selling legal, albeit controversial, products, say like sex workers who often face deplatforming. It will be tomorrow's unbanked who will be the natural customers of non-gated decentralized systems.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/28/the-standard-about-to-revolutionize-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/656c6f46eb58dfe0bd548e09a39134fc08b80bf0-1044x811.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384797,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlP6F,1601316193,Crypto Is Too Dependent on Dollars,"Crypto has many problems of its own making. Bad user experiences, unsustainable transaction fees, an inability to assess risks in the face of unyielding innovation. But until this year, I doubt anyone would have suggested that an interdependence on the U.S. dollar was one of them.      The introduction of easily tradable, even decentralized, stablecoins has been a godsend for millions of ordinary people. They can now hedge against the constant fluctuations in the price of ETH and BTC. And price stability means global commerce need no longer be obviously deterred in integrating programmable money into their digital operations.      And yet, the land of the dollar is in trouble. The full economic repercussions of shutting down an economy for many months are yet to reach its apex. Debt is being monetized on a huge scale. There are huge wealth divides between generations, races and cities.      Cultural and political divides run equally as deep. The U.S. population is so attitudinally polarized that even wearing a mask is political based on party. And at the top, the country is led by administration intent on stoking more division and taking sides. U.S. politics is so broken, it is not beyond comprehension that full-blown civil strife could break out. In fact, it is something U.S. journalists and generals have openly contemplated in trepidation of the possibility.    Shiv Malik is the author of two books, the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation think tank and a former investigative journalist for the Guardian. He currently evangelizes about a new decentralized data economy for the open source project Streamr.    And if America is so precariously balanced between further prosperity and potential disaster, so, too, rests the fate of the U.S. dollar for the rest of the world. Just the issue of U.S. Treasury debt issuance alone has had professional money managers warning this month that the U.S.’ reserve currency status is under threat.      Traditional markets have mature financial products to hedge or flee such tectonic shifts. There are plenty of other world currencies or other non-USD denominated assets to transfer funds into should the dollar take a serious tumble.      Crypto lacks those same products, what an economist or trader might coldly describe as “financial instruments to hedge against external political risks."" Despite Web 3.0’s aim to be both global in reach and also free of the control of nation states, its fate is still incredibly tied to the U.S. dollar.      See also: Pascal Hügli - Hyper-Stablecoinization: From Eurodollars to Crypto-Dollars      The crypto ecosystem utilizes the global reserve currency in almost every facet of its user experience. Of course, there are those BTC or ETH natives who sleep and breathe satoshis and gwei, but go to any exchange, or check gas prices in your wallet: Crypto was built and is used by people who still work in greenbacks.      The most obvious route out of such interdependence would be to adopt euro-, yen- or yuan-backed stablecoins. But where there are more than half a dozen USD stablecoins with trading volumes regularly above $5 million per day, there are no non-USD stablecoins that can compete at that level.      Why hasn’t one taken off as yet? Mariano Conti, formerly of the MakerDAO parish, the group that built the autonomous dollar-pegged dai (DAI) stablecoin, is better placed than most to explain why their team opted for dollars.      Originally, Conti told me, dai was meant to be pegged to the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Right (SDR), which serves as the unit of account between IMF nation state members. The IMF derives SDR by bundling and carefully weighting five major currencies including the yuan, euro, British pound and the yen. But, to put it succinctly, Conti said, “USD was chosen in the end because people think in dollars, not SDR.”      See also: The Biggest Story in Crypto: The Stablecoin Surge and Power Politics      Could this be changed? Could dai transfer to being backed by the euro or yen?      “The protocol is capable of changing its peg to follow another currency if needed,” he said, “although the process would likely be painful.” A better idea is “issuing another currency, say EuroDai or YenDai backed by dai.” In other words, building on success by supporting a new stablecoin with already existing collateral.      “If they start gaining traction, having a DollarDai spin-off and then slowly make the underlying dai drift to an existing or new basket of currencies” would also be workable, he said.      So decentralized, euro- or yen-backed stablecoins are possible, but all of this would take time: Months to create, but perhaps over a year to really gain the trust of a community. And then perhaps even longer to build into the user experience of hundreds of dapps.      A too-tight deadline but, to contemplate the worst, one that crypto might soon have no choice but to embrace.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shiv Malik,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/28/crypto-is-too-dependent-on-dollars,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f9179a262fbacd748774e8ba186cd5083fb55b3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384811,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlPLL,1601312880,Ocean Protocol Forks to Retrieve Tokens Stolen From KuCoin Exchange,"Artificial intelligence and data service Ocean Protocol has suspended its old contract on the Ethereum blockchain and hard-forked its project, following the $150 million KuCoin hack.      On Sunday at 22:00 UTC, Ocean Protocol announced it had migrated from its old token address to a new one to thwart the KuCoin hacker's attempts to offload 21 million OCEAN tokens worth some $8.6 million. According to a Sept. 27 blog post from the Ocean Protocol team:    “At 1600 GMT, a new contract was instantiated reflecting the balances of OCEAN as of block height 10943665 on the Ethereum mainnet. The new smart contract will allocate stolen token balances to an address which will be held in trust in Singapore for persons affected by the theft.”    Moving contract addresses has effectively blacklisted the hacker’s stash of OCEAN tokens. But it also raises questions of the project's true immutability if the protocol can be effectively hard-forked in one weekend.      Prior to the hard fork, the hacker offloaded some 330,000 OCEAN tokens worth $120,000, according to The Block's head of research, Larry Cermak. Ocean Protocol has a liquid supply of 587,622,921 OCEAN tokens with a maximum supply of 1.4 billion OCEAN.    KuCoin hack    Singapore-based KuCoin was hacked Friday beginning at 19:05 UTC. The hacker gained access to the platform’s hot wallet keys, said KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu in a weekend livestream.      Lyu said the platform intends to cover for hacked losses with insurance funds.      OCEAN’s price fell as much as 8% from $0.399 per token to $0.365 as the hacker sold the stolen tokens in tranches of 10,000 coins, according to CoinGecko. He or she then moved onto other holdings including COMP, SNX and LINK after the contract was paused.      The hacker swapped stolen ERC-20 tokens for ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain. These swaps have largely been facilitated by Uniswap, a popular decentralized exchange (DEX) due to a novel liquidity model that reduces price slippage.

42384810,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlPK5,1601308652,"Blockchain Bites: DeFi Meets NFTs, TSLA Beats Bitcoin in Volatility, Uniswap Breaks $2B","Bitcoin is moving off exchanges, has been less volatile than TLSA and broke its record for longest streak trading above five figures.      Also: Bitwise's bitcoin fund has more than doubled in size, KuCoin was hacked and Jack Dorsey dropped a few more hints about his decentralized social media standard, Blue Sky.    Top shelf    Accredited investor interest Bitwise’s bitcoin fund has brought in $8.9 million, the single-largest increase in assets raised in the fund’s two-year history, according to a recently amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The firm’s Bitcoin Fund provides accredited U.S. investors with exposure to bitcoin through a traditional product. In 2019, the fund attracted $4.1 million in investment, meaning the fund has more than doubled in size the past year. Bitwise executives pointed to fears of inflation and bitcoin’s role as a hedge as reasons for increased interest in their product. Bitcoin’s well-known volatility is often seen as a barrier to entry for institutional clients, but the cryptocurrency has in fact been more stable than Tesla’s (TSLA) stock.      Enterprise solutions EY has unveiled a new Ethereum-based, enterprise-grade blockchain solution called the OpsChain Network Procurement. The platform is designed to enable companies to run private end-to-end procurement activities by allowing buyers and sellers to operate as networks, while automatically tracking volumes and spend and utilizing agreed terms and pricing. The platform utilizes open-source software including the Microsoft-backed Baseline Protocol and operates on the public Ethereum blockchain, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports.      Twitter’s blockchain Jack Dorsey said blockchain is the future of Twitter and his latest initiative is looking to hire at least five new roles, while speaking at the virtual Oslo Freedom Forum 2020 on Friday. The CEO of Twitter and Square revealed details of the nonprofit Blue Sky initiative meant to create an open standard for social media. Under this vision, users can contribute to and access data from a decentralized version of Twitter instead of a centralized service where the social media platform hosts content on its website. “Blockchain and bitcoin point to a future, point to a world, where content exists forever,” Dorsey said. “We’re not in the content hosting business anymore, we’re in the discovery business.”      KuCoin hack Over the weekend, a hacker breached KuCoin’s hot wallets absconding with some $150 million in crypto. KuCoin said in a statement that it detected large withdrawals of bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) tokens to an unknown wallet beginning at 19:05 UTC time on Friday. The exchange’s chief executive Johnny Lyu said KuCoin has transferred the remaining funds from compromised wallets to new addresses and momentarily froze customer deposits and withdrawals. While other exchanges including Bitfinex and Tether have blacklisted the stolen funds. An investigation is underway and stolen customer money will be “covered completely” by an insurance fund, Lyu said.      DeFi goes NFT The excitement in DeFi has shifted to the NFT market, CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reports. NFTs, one-of-a-kind tokens made possible by Ethereum’s ERC-721 standard, have not captivated investor attention until quite recently when people realized these digital collectibles could be used for yield farming. Platforms like NIFTEX have enabled NFT indices, Rarible has added a native token and Uniswap’s liquidity pools are creating new avenues for financialization – a trend Dale traces back to John Lyall’s MEME experiment.

Uniswap clocked the record figure just after midnight (UTC) Monday, according to crypto rankings website DeFi Pulse. The next biggest DeFi project, peer-to-peer lending platform Maker, trails slightly behind Uniswap at $1.96 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFi Pulse. There's now more than $11 billion in TVL in the DeFi ecosystem, with Uniswap making up approximately 18% of that.    Market intel    Five digit streak Bitcoin closed Sunday at $10,793 setting a record of 63 consecutive daily closes above $10,000, according to market data aggregated by Messari. The bellwether cryptocurrency’s previous record 62-day streak above $10,000 lasted from Dec. 1, 2017, through Jan. 31, 2018, when bitcoin reached its all-time high of just above $19,900 on Coinbase, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reports.      Exchanges down? The balance of bitcoin on major exchanges has hit its lowest levels since November 2018, potentially signalling a bullish view from bitcoin holders, as they move to longer-term holding strategies, such as cold wallets. Additionally, a rise in new investors during the coronavirus pandemic has led to a growth in “white glove” services, meaning fewer bitcoin on exchanges and more in managed portfolios. Another possible explanation? Bitcoin is being moved to tokenization solutions for use in the DeFi ecosystem, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reports.    Op-ed    Stablecoin guidance Reading between the lines, CoinDesk Director of Research Noelle Acheson thinks the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) latest stablecoin guidance is more than a nudge for the industry. “This could incentivize banks to actively seek stablecoin business, and in so doing, broaden both their client base and their stake in crypto markets... So, a bank could attract not just stablecoin issuers, but also their clients. It would then make sense to facilitate the transfers of stablecoins between clients, and (why not) even between banks. New payments networks could emerge, which in turn could give rise to a host of new banking services,” she writes.

In a post Sunday, the blockchain-based storage provider said the mainnet will launch at block 148,888, currently expected on Oct. 15.  Designed as a decentralized alternative to Amazon Web Services or Cloudflare, a data retrieval service, Filecoin raised $205 million in a 2017 token sale – the most raised in an ICO at the time.  Having originally committed itself to a mainnet launch in mid-2019, the project has sustained industry interest with 230 projects and 1,000 developers set to begin work on Filecoin when live.  More than 400 miners from around the world participated in this month's ""Space Race"" testnet phase where network data capacity increased by more than 325+ pebibytes – seven times the entire written works of mankind, in all languages.  In the coming weeks, the project said it will continue adding storage, optimize operations and undergo final tests, as well as allow community members to prepare their own systems ahead of the launch.  Approximately 3.5 million native FIL tokens – used to buy and sell storage on the network – will be distributed to Space Race participants.  As Filecoin has refused to say anything that could sway FIL's initial price, it's unknown how much the 3.6 million tokens might be worth in dollar terms.  According to Filecoin block explorer Filfox, the network had reached a block height of 99,876 at time of writing.

42384804,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlPCX,1601299970,Bitcoin Miner Producer Ebang Blames Coronavirus for 50% Slump in Revenue,"Ebang has said the knock-on effects of the coronavirus outbreak caused revenue to fall by half in the first six months of 2020.    Total net revenue for the Nasdaq-listed mining equipment manufacturer slumped to $11 million in H1 2020, down 50.6% from $22.35 million made in the same period the year before, per a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week.  In a statement, Ebang Chairman and CEO Dong Hu linked the drop in revenue to the pandemic, which had led chip suppliers to reduce capacity and caused a chronic shortage of raw materials that severely disrupted Ebang's business.  By way of a silver lining, though, while net revenue was far below last year, Ebang saved more than $10 million in operating expenses and losses in H1 2020.  As per the unaudited financial results, comprehensive net loss fell from nearly $17.6 million in the first half of 2019 to just under $7.3 million in H1 2020  Hu said the disruption caused by the pandemic meant the Chinese-based company had optimized its revenue structure and started to explore new revenue streams.  Earlier this year, Ebang announced plans to launch its own offshore crypto exchange, something CFO Chen Lei said could double total revenue by 2022.  Ebang earned $300 million in revenue in 2018, the tail-end of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom.  Despite the H1 drop in revenue, the market seems to have responded well to Ebang's efforts to diversify: shares were up 2.5% to $9.85 at time of writing, close to double the $5 value at its Nasdaq debut in late June.

42384809,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlPIp,1601299852,"The Inevitable Marriage of Yield Farming and NFTs, Explained","Why is the marriage of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) happening now? It's debatable but you can make an argument that it comes back to DeFi's favorite robo-advisor for yield: Yearn.Finance.      Lately, everything in DeFi seems to link back to Yearn.Finance in some way.      The excitement in DeFi has shifted to the NFT market, with something like a Weird DeFi moment getting ever weirder, as groups form up to mint rare digital artifacts to be attained in unique ways and financialize their ownership, thanks in part to picks-and-shovels work undertaken by the yeomen of online collectibles.      The plethora of strange new experiments has been led in particular by the token MEME, inspired by a tweet from ConsenSys staffer Jordan Lyall. To explain MEME, though, a lot of other developments need to be visited first.    NFT basics    Reminder: NFTs are one-of-a-kind tokens made possible by Ethereum's ERC-721 standard. Pioneered by CryptoPunks, then standardized and popularized by CryptoKitties, crypto collectibles started much like trading cards (trading cards that could make babies, at least in CryptoKitties' case), but they were always envisioned to have more potential than baseball cards.      Ever since Napster, ownership and rights of digitally distributed intellectual property has been a problem.      ""It's hard to own that media, but you can do it pretty cleanly using tokens,"" Priyanka Desai, VP of operations at Ethereum startup OpenLaw, told CoinDesk in a phone call.      Desai's been talking to NFT pioneers lately as she helps to put together a new decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Flamingo whose investors are focused on NFTs.      Read more: NFTs Are Here. But Where Are They Headed?      NFTs have not captivated investor attention until quite recently, because lending, borrowing and risk management – what we now call DeFi – has taken up all Ethereum's oxygen in 2020. So Ethereans largely lost interest in NFTs there for a while – and who could blame them? You could buy them and sell them, and sometimes games would come together, but they seldom held players' attention for very long. There were more dynamic markets to game; art's fine but money is money.      Even when there had been buzz, some projects would rise up only to fade away, revealing a weakness in the NFT specification. CryptoStrikers, for example, a sports memorabilia project launched during the World Cup is long gone (soccer-focused Sorare has emerged in its wake).      Also gone: Panda Earth and CryptoJingles and more, and with them the various artworks that made NFTs more than just a weird string of numbers in an Ethereum wallet (these days, teams are using perpetual data storage solution Arweave to address the issue of NFT impermanence).    The NFT–yield farming crossover event    There has been years of fertilizer but somehow the excitement engendered this summer by yield farming has come to NFTs this fall, and so the harvest is ready.      And here's how Yearn could have helped: When the DeFi gateway created Y.Insure, a way to do KYC-free insurance on any crypto asset, it used NFTs to represent the policy with insurers.      ""Insurance policies have unique properties, so ERC-20 didn't make sense since it needed to include covered address+amount+duration,"" Yearn's lead developer, Andre Cronje, told CoinDesk via Telegram. (ERC-20 is the token standard that launched a thousand coins.)      So, once reminded of ERC-721's existence by DeFi's top Chad, the industry ran with it.      Read more: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto's 'Weird DeFi' Moment      Was it exactly a causal relationship? Who knows. The larger point of NFT and DeFi coming together is more about a growing mood than a clear chain of events. Weird DeFi showed how open finance could become more elfin; elves need toys; NFTs were right there.      Blockade Games is a company looking for every way it can to push the properties of tokenized game assets to their limit.      ""People want to play,"" Blockade CEO Marguerite deCourcelle told CoinDesk in a phone call. Also known as ""Coin Artist,"" she just issued her own NFT, as well.      ""Crypto communities have always been trying to be games,"" she said.    The financialization of NFTs    A lot of people in crypto are rich and that makes all the best stuff too expensive for the cryptoletariat.      As much as people like owning expensive stuff in crypto, they like owning stuff they can sell whenever they want even more (call it a liquidity fetish). NFTs had managed to be expensive but they had not managed to be liquid, not until DeFi-thinking intervened.      ""The general trend is, 'OK, NFTs are cool but it's a relatively illiquid asset class compared to tokens,'"" said CoinFund's Jake Brukhman.      Brukhman has always been bullish on NFTs, never losing that focus even as other investors fully turned their attention elsewhere.      ""NFTs are actually a financial asset class and they need financial infrastructure,"" Brukhman said.      Read more: Gemini's Nifty Gateway Bets on Celebs to Drive Interest in Crypto Collectibles      The stranger products are emergent phenomena of that financialization. Brukhman gave the example of Ark Gallery, which is a DAO for CryptoPunks. The punks were made pre-ERC-721 and have become quite valuable as early, cool and rare (there are only 10,000 such punks, each completely distinct). Ark allows people to crowdfund a punk (owning a fraction of the token) and then voting on whether or not to sell it if there's an offer.      If there is a successful offer, everyone gets a proportionate share of the payment, based on how much they own. This has made CryptoPunks trade at ever-higher prices, allowing more people to feel like they had a piece of one. It's clear that the spikes in volume have gone much higher this year when viewed on NFT data site NonFungible.com.      NIFTEX has taken that even further. Launched early this year with funding from Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk's parent company), NIFTEX started off creating indices for NFTs, such as digital real estate or digital cards. But the real innovation kicked off when the firm fractionalized expensive NFTs into what it calls shards (really, just ERC-20 tokens – fungible slivers of previously singular digital assets).      The shard system works somewhat like what Ark Gallery does, except only someone who holds one of the ERC-20 tokens that represents partial ownership of an item can make an offer. The offer automatically succeeds if it fails to receive enough objections in two weeks, with a clever strategy built in to punish low-ball bids.      NIFTEX did its first fractionalization in May and, like Ark, the firm is seeing a lot more liquidity. Shard holders own a fractionalized, extremely rare Axie Infinity card called Almace that saw over 1,000 ETH transacted in its first week after sharding. Joel Hubert, one of the two co-founders, estimated its liquidity all year would have been more like 300 or 400 ETH in a few trades, without sharding.      On NonFungible, Axie Infinity shows appreciably more dollars getting transacted even if the volumes are only bumped up slightly.      Read more: $100K in Early Prizes Looks to Lure the NFT-Curious to Decentraland      ""I like where we're at because Ethereum is all about experimentation,"" Hubert said.      The larger point to all of this is that content is finding a path to fair remuneration on the internet.      Added Flamingo's Desai, ""When you start talking about how content creators are paid, that's where DeFi comes in; and when you start talking about property of creators, that's all NFTs.""    NFT mining    For her personal NFT, deCourcelle used NIFTEX to sell off a portion of her shards, into tokens called COIN. She said she wants people to see it as ""play money.""      ""First thing we're doing is the most basic sort of farm,"" she said, driving home the intended playfulness. COIN holders who add to the Uniswap pool can stake their liquidity provider (LP) tokens and earn another token, CRED, which will offer advantages in Blockade's games, as well as additional COIN.      Rewarding liquidity with a fresh new token is a particular kind of yield farming: liquidity mining.      Of course, that's not the only or first mining in the digital property space, and mining is what this whole story is about: DeFi and NFTs merging to create weird new forms of yield that get the imaginations of investors and BUIDLers firing.      The pioneer in the NFT mining industry was arguably Rarible, a marketplace and minter. It growth-hacked its user base by airdropping RARI tokens to anyone that had transacted in a respectable amount of NFTs. It was a governance token that it used to turn its marketplace into a DAO.      Rarible further rewarded users for transactions on the platform, which has generated a substantial amount of questionable volume, but also has helped persuade creators that the additional benefit to transacting there makes it an advantageous place to list work, Brukhman said.      Read more: The Fast-Growing NFT Market Is Problematic Yet Promising      So now NFT fans have fractional ownership, auctions, sales platforms: all the things that seem like normal, natural pieces of the puzzle for setting up a dynamic market.      But the buzz stems from the fact that stranger things are getting built.    Bold experiments    First off, there's Aavegotchi, a small startup with funding from the money market Aave, among others. Aavegotchi has a clever variable rarity structure described well in a recent report by Delphi Digital.      In short, Aavegotchis are little playable avatars that can be used in the game world the company is building, both as protocol governance and to play actual games. There's a lot of ways they can change and be upgraded (called ""rarity farming""), but if too many players ""improve"" their character in the same way, it can effectively lose rarity.      Like in the DeFi game Based.Money, it's all about guessing how other players will move.      What's really interesting about Aavegotchi, however, is this: Every character represents a real stake on Aave. The owner can liquidate the stake at any time, but their Aavegotchi will disappear. So it's a test to see what happens to playability when characters have real value above and beyond their gaming value.      Read more: Aave Becomes Second DeFi Project to Overtake MakerDAO for Most Crypto Deposited      For Blockade CEO deCourcelle, this linkage makes complete sense; DeFi will always look like a shell game until it's financing things of real value, stuff someone would just buy because they want it.      Are people going to do that with their houses or will they do it maybe with fun digital stuff first?      ""All these DeFi projects are looking for the core economic leap for all of these microeconomies,"" she argued. ""As a game developer, you have already designed an economic loop that's valuable.""    Don't Buy $MEME    But the real experiment is MEME.      As noted, MEME started with a jest from Lyall. One of MEME's insiders (a so-called ""Citadel"" member) is Jackson (who sticks to one name and is also on the team making the payments platform Flexa).      He made a bold case for MEME to CoinDesk in a phone call, saying:    ""The project is on a roll where the whole NFT/DEFI narrative is kind of tied to MEME and kind of leading the pack.""    Folks in Lyall's cohort got interested in his humorous nudge, a Telegram group formed and a stranger spun up the code to make the MEME token.      ""It was like: What can we build?"" Jackson said.      He describes himself as someone who typically sticks to projects that make sense to him, where the business case is easy to see. MEME has felt completely different, he said. It's been more like a vibe and a crew first, with purpose coming later.      This is much like what DeFi Pulse's Scott Lewis argued about the vegetable tokens of distant early September, saying that the future may be defined by groups first galvanized by an image, only to decide what to do together later.      ""I, daily, deeply contemplate what I'm learning from this,"" Jackson said of MEME.      For now, Lyall told CoinDesk over Telegram, MEME is just paying cool artists (largely out of pocket) to make compelling NFTs and giving people a way to buy them – by locking up MEME and earning points in the MEME system (they aren't really tokens because they aren't tradeable so far).      If people like the images locked onto MEME's NFTs, they might want to figure out how to own them. ""Relative to the other hot projects in DeFi, we're a lot more accessible,"" Jackson said.      That's something everyone we spoke with pointed out: People get content, whether it's stuff for video games, art, music or literature. People have made NFTs of a lot of weird stuff.      Read more: Non-Believable Tokens: The 7 Strangest Crypto Collectibles Explained      ""This is the media art bent to what's happening in DeFi,"" Desai said.      MEME is doing something that has yet to be seen in the crypto space: testing a product first, then sorting out the business plan later if they see traction. It's an old script in Silicon Valley, but in crypto, everything credible has largely needed to make sense as a business upfront, the only question being whether people would come.      And MEME won't be the last. A different cohort of crypto luminaries tried to imitate MEME with FEW but that ended in a shillacious disaster. ROPE still lingers out there, and it's not clear what that is, besides leaning more on a 4chan aesthetic.      And, off in the background, there is SHROOM, which has been perhaps the least explicative. Its sole blog post mentions a decentralized exchange or DEX, though, which could be a hint. A market with puzzles wired in could be the trick, and that could be what NFTs meeting DeFi unlocks.      ""NFTs, just as art? The value proposition is a little. But once you have a game? The value is inherent to the game,"" deCourcelle said.",NEUTRAL,ETH | MEME,AXS | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MEME,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/28/the-inevitable-marriage-of-yield-farming-and-nfts-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d1afb3270f40ea56220031b97d8bf62727a0f09-2560x1188.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That means traders can keep an eye on exchange wallets to gauge whether investors and crypto miners are getting their bitcoin into position for a possible sale – or taking balances down from the exchanges in anticipation of holding for the longer term.      The latter might be what's happening now, CoinDesk's Muyao Shen reported Monday. Total balances of bitcoin on major exchanges has hit its lowest levels since November 2018. It could be an indication of bullishness among bitcoin traders.      “There’s no reason to sell now,"" Mike Alfred, CEO of Digital Assets Data, told Shen in a phone interview. “Why would you be selling when you’re at the beginning of a wave of potential corporate treasuries and institutional investors coming in?”      Another interpretation, according to Arcane Research, is that traders are taking their bitcoin off exchanges to deploy them in the decentralized finance sector, known as DeFi. Juicy returns can be obtained from tokenizing crypto assets and depositing them as collateral in semi-automated, blockchain-based trading and lending platforms.      As CoinDesk reported earlier this week, tokenized bitcoin has become one of the largest assets on DeFi. Currently, there are more than 108,000 BTC worth some $1.1 billion minted from seven issuers, according to Dune Analytics.      That might be another bullish sign.

Tesla (TSLA) has been seeing bigger daily percentage moves since the end of June, according to 30-day realized volatility data.  Further, the volatility gulf between the two assets has been widening in recent weeks.  Bitcoin witnessed a below-1.25% daily move in 14 out of the last 27 days, according to data from TradingView – almost 52% of the time.  However, Tesla only achieved sub-1.25% moves 6% of the time over the same period, data source Skew tweeted early Monday.  ""People always assume bitcoin is incredibly volatile, but it's not more volatile than many popular tech stocks,"" Skew co-founder and CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk.  Looking at the price charts, both bitcoin and Tesla have witnessed two-way business this month and formed contracting triangles (narrowing price ranges), as shown below.  However, Tesla has seen a month-to-date price decline of 18% – far worse than bitcoin's 6% drop.  Bitcoin's 30-day historical volatility, which measures the price action realized in the past 30 days, has been flatlined near 55% (annualized) since Sept. 3.  Further, its 30-day implied volatility – that is, investors' expectations of how volatile price will be over the next four weeks – has declined to 44%, the lowest level in nearly two years.  In the past, big moves have been preceded by an implied volatility reading of less than 50%.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $10,911, representing an over 2% gain on the day.

42384796,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlP3j,1601288897,Bitwise Bitcoin Fund Doubles to $9M as Investor Fears Grow Over Runaway Inflation,"Accredited investors worried about out-of-control inflation have poured millions into Bitwise's bitcoin fund as a means to preserve the value of their portfolios.      An amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week showed the asset manager had raised, in total, just under $8.9 million for its Bitcoin Fund, which provides accredited U.S. investors with exposure to bitcoin through a traditional product.      This marks the single-largest increase in assets raised in the fund's two-year history. A filing from 2019 shows the Bitcoin Fund had attracted $4.1 million in investment, meaning the fund has more than doubled in size in the past year.      While bitcoin has come on in leaps and bounds in its acceptance among the traditional investment community, Bitwise's head of research, Matthew Hougan, told CoinDesk the more immediate cause for the surge in the fund's size came from concerns over runaway inflation.      ""With the unprecedented expansion of the [Federal Reserve's] balance sheet, the radical amounts of fiscal stimulus, and the Fed's new and significantly more dovish inflation policy, [Bitwise clients] are looking for a hedge,"" he said in an email.      ""Bitcoin is the most efficient hedge for inflation that exists in today's market,"" he added.      See also: First Mover: As Central Banks Print $1.4B an Hour, Bitcoiners Bet on Federal Reserve 'Capture'      Fiscal stimulus has become a favored tool for governments and central banks as they battle to keep economic activity alive in the wake of the pandemic. The Federal Reserve initially pumped more than $2.8 trillion into the economy and dropped interest to rock-bottom rates.      As Congress debates another $2.4 trillion stimulus package in the run-up to the November elections, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this month the central bank was unlikely to tighten monetary policy for at least three years and will even tolerate inflation above the 2% target in order to make up for the drop in consumer prices during the peak of the pandemic.      Hougan said many of Bitwise's clients were financial advisers who serve wealthy investors, themselves wary about the debilitating effects inflation can have on their portfolios. Many investors see bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million as a means to preserve value in the event loose monetary policy leads to runaway inflation.      Indeed, other fund managers have experienced similar surges in demand from the same stratum of well-heeled investors. In the summer, $250 million found its way into three funds run by the New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG); Pantera Capital told the Securities and Exchange Commission in August it had received nearly $165 million in placements from qualified investors – those worth at least $5 million.

In a press statement issued Sunday, EY (or Ernst & Young) said its OpsChain Network Procurement platform is designed to enable companies to run private end-to-end procurement activities.  The platform utilizes open-source software including the Microsoft-backed Baseline Protocol and operates on the public Ethereum blockchain.  The product is designed to support enterprise networks, allowing buyers and sellers to operate as networks, while automatically tracking volumes and spend, and utilizing agreed terms and pricing.  It's also aimed to move business processes outside of any one ERP system to a shared blockchain-based smart contract, according to the consultancy firm.  EY global blockchain lead Paul Brody said putting the process on a blockchain means not having to persuade a company to join a ""costly, closed proprietary network.”  The company also said that, based on its experience with other procurement systems, switching to a blockchain-based solution has cut down ERP cycle times by more than 90% and reduced costs by up to 40%.  Companies can now plug into EY's beta platform and enable direct integration with their own ERP systems via APIs, EY said.

42384803,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlPA1,1601285515,$2B Locked: Uniswap Now Bigger Than Entire DeFi Industry Just Two Months Ago,"Uniswap is now bigger than the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) space was just two months ago, as the trading protocol becomes the first to pass the $2 billion milestone in total value locked (TVL).    Uniswap clocked the record figure just after midnight (UTC) Monday and currently has $2.06 billion worth of crypto assets locked in, according to DeFi Pulse.  Testament to its neck-breaking growth, there's now more value just in Uniswap than there was in the entire DeFi space on July 9.  As of press time, there's now more than $11 billion in TVL in DeFi, with Uniswap making up approximately 18% of that.  The Ethereum-based Uniswap utilizes an automated market-making system leveraging liquidity pools so users can exchange or ""swap"" between ether (ETH) and any ERC-20 token.  Holders are incentivized to deposit tokens in these liquidity pools with interest and a cut of the swap fee – the total balance in these pools together make up Uniswap's $2 billion TVL.  Monday's news shows just how much Uniswap's fortunes have changed in the past few weeks.  Back in early September, $830 million worth of vital liquidity moved to rival protocol SushiSwap, causing Uniswap's TVL to plunge to just $400 million by Sept. 10. (It should be noted, however, it wasn't a zero-sum game: Uniswap's TVL had been $230 million before the SushiSwap saga began.)  A week later, in order to coax users back, Uniswap launched its own native UNI token and airdropped over $500 million to wallet addresses who had been using the protocol since before September.  UNI has led users to quickly snap back to Uniswap and its TVL was approximately $1.8 billion just days after the token launched.  The platform plans to issue and distribute 4 billion UNI tokens to the community over the next four years.  The next biggest DeFi project, peer-to-peer lending platform Maker, trails slightly behind Uniswap at $1.96 billion TVL, according to DeFi Pulse.

Perpetual contracts on Europe 50 (EUROPE50IXF0: USTF0) and Germany 30 (GERMANY30IXF0: USTF0) will go live at 09:00 UTC on Monday, the firm said in a press release.  Each contract offers up to 100x leverage and will be settled in stablecoin tether (USDT).  A perpetual contract is similar to a traditional futures contract, but has no expiry and mimics a margin-based spot market.  The STOXX Europe 50 includes 50 stocks from 18 European countries and provides a blue-chip representation of supersector leaders in the region.  Meanwhile, the German 30 or DAX 30 is a stock index that represents 30 of the largest and most liquid German companies that trade on the Frankfurt Exchange.  “This is the first time that an exchange from the digital asset space has launched a product that bridges the gap with traditional stock markets, representing a significant milestone in the evolution of crypto as an established asset class,” said Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Bitfinex Derivatives.  Using tether – a so-called stablecoin designed to maintain a value of per token – will facilitate settlement in cross-asset class trading strategies, hedging and risk management, Ardoino added.  The perpetual contracts will be open for trading 24/7, unlike equity exchanges which are open for business for a limited number of hours, five days a week.  As such, traditional market investors may turn to Bitfinex’s perpetual swaps on data- or event-heavy weekends for price discovery ahead of Monday's opening bell.  “Over the weekend, we may reasonably expect lower volumes than on weekdays in the normal course of a business unless there are significant economic developments over the weekend, such as a central bank policy shift, etc,” Bitfinex told CoinDesk in an email.  The exchange will aim to ensure price stability by putting a +/-5% cap on the final mark price from 4:30 p.m. UTC until 8:00 a.m. UTC on the following day.

42384792,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlNb9,1601272800,Bitcoin Balances on Exchanges at 2-Year Low and That May Be a Bullish Sign,"The balance of bitcoin on major exchanges has hit its lowest levels since November 2018. Yet unlike that time, when bitcoin was in the depths of the crypto winter, some see this current spate of low bitcoin balances on exchanges as a sign that a new generation of investors is putting its money in it for the long term.      The last time bitcoin balances on exchanges were at this low a point was in November 2018, according to data from Glassnode. A hard fork on Bitcoin Cash that month may have also caused the declining bitcoin balances on exchanges since some owners were moving their bitcoins to private wallets in order to claim the new tokens from the fork. Bitcoin then continued its bearish trend into the beginning of 2019, before it recovered in April of that year.    Long-term holders as a possible reason    Low bitcoin balances on centralized exchanges do not necessarily imply a bearish market trend. In fact, it could reflect a bullish view from bitcoin holders, as they move to longer-term holding strategies, such as cold wallets, Glassnode tweeted back on April 14.      That may be the case with this most recent drop in balances, according to Mike Alfred, CEO of Digital Assets Data.      “There’s no reason to sell now when you have large corporate treasuries like MicroStrategy buying the asset now,” Alfred told CoinDesk in a phone interview. “Why would you be selling when you’re at the beginning of a wave of potential corporate treasuries and institutional investors coming in?”      Read more: Bitcoin CEO: MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor Explains His $425M Bet on BTC      South Korea-based data provider CryptoQuant also captured the declining bitcoin balances on exchanges. According to the company’s CEO, Ki Young Ju, this means there are fewer bitcoin holders who could sell their bitcoins on exchanges, avoiding a possible major market correction.      However, this decline hasn’t been a straight line down, according to another crypto data source, Chainalysis. Their data show daily net inflow of bitcoin to exchanges logging its biggest single-day increase on Sept 21 since the market crash on March 12. Philip Gradwell, an economist at the company, told CoinDesk that the number indicated “a weakening market.”      “While the overall amount of bitcoin held on exchanges is low, it has increased over the last few days, still small relative to the longer term decline in bitcoin held on exchanges,” Gradwell wrote in an email response to CoinDesk.    The rise of bitcoin on DeFi    The latest bitcoin balance drop on exchanges started in mid-March when prices took a steep tumble to a 10-month low, according to Norwegian crypto analysis firm Arcane Research’s weekly report on Sept. 22.      Arcane Research attributed the decreased bitcoin balance on exchanges partly to the white-hot decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, where bitcoin is being tokenized on Ethereum by those lending the cryptocurrency in exchange for yields.      “In the same period [since March 15, 2020], more than 100,000 BTC have found their way into Ethereum protocols, which could explain some of the outflow,” the research team wrote.      As CoinDesk reported earlier this week, tokenized bitcoin has become one of the largest assets on DeFi. Currently, more than 108,000 BTC worth some $1.1 billion minted from seven issuers, according to Dune Analytics.    An influx of less-experienced investors    Others, at the same time, say that a new flux of crypto investors since the coronavirus pandemic started could be the reason for the low bitcoin balance on exchanges. These investors, coming mostly from traditional financial markets, may prefer “white glove” services such as a crypto investment fund to manage their crypto portfolios for them, instead of going to crypto exchanges themselves.      As a result, the bitcoin balance on exchanges has been dropping this year both consistently and significantly.      Digital Assets Data’s Alfred said that crypto fund companies such as Grayscale (a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk) are buying a large amount of bitcoin, as both high-net-worth individuals and institutions are putting new capitals into the crypto market. For example, at the start of Q3, Grayscale had $4.1 billion in assets under management (AUM). As of Sept. 23, its AUM was $5.5 billion.      Traditional investors may be concerned with easy monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, other central banks and governments around the world. But unlike the old generation of crypto investors, who were often technologically sophisticated early adopters, new crypto investors are less familiar with how crypto assets work and therefore less comfortable with holding and managing bitcoins themselves, according to Alfred. They thus turn over their investment capital to more experienced firms.      “These are people that don't know much about bitcoin,” Alfred said. “They just know that they want to own something (in crypto) and they don't want to do it themselves.”      This sentiment is echoed by Babel Finance, a Hong Kong-based crypto lender. In a WeChat conversation with CoinDesk, Simons Chen, executive director of investment and trading of the company, said that bitcoin balances on crypto exchanges have been taken away by both decentralized exchanges and crypto investment funds.      “Institutional investors are withdrawing their bitcoin from exchanges and transferring them elsewhere,” the chat wrote. “So the low bitcoin balance on exchanges is happening not because of any market correction, and as a result, there has not been much pricing pressure.”      Notably, bitcoin’s price – which is known for its volatility – has been becoming less volatile this year. Alfred said it is partly due to more capital flows into the leading cryptocurrency, as well.      “I think volatility has come down pretty dramatically in part because there's so much traditional capital coming in, which really dampens the volatility,” he said. “You have this very supportive bid coming from all this new money coming in that believes in the long-term fundamental story and is not buying just to sell right away.”",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/28/bitcoin-balances-on-exchanges-at-2-year-low-and-that-may-be-a-bullish-sign,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a3b179b3cb448f95920ef9410ca497652b0c3b1-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384794,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlNdf,1601257862,Crypto Long & Short: The OCC’s Stablecoin Statement Is a Seed of Financial Innovation,"An unsurprising statement from a financial regulator is sending some welcome signals that point to a spurt of innovation ahead.      The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a statement earlier this week saying that national banks can provide services to stablecoin issuers in the U.S.      This is not a surprise, as banks have been doing so for some time. But they have been doing so under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty. The statement gives the first sign of official clarity on the idea that stablecoins are legitimate representations of value.    Acceptance and support    Why is this significant for markets?      To start with, it signals a growing regulatory acceptance of stablecoins. While fiat-backed blockchain-based tokens have been often talked about in the halls of power, especially after Facebook’s stablecoin project Libra was announced last year, they had not been recognized in an official statement as an acceptable result of financial innovation – until now.      And the U.S. is not the only significant economic bloc to signal acceptance: Earlier this week, the European Central Bank (ECB) issued a report that assesses the threats stablecoins could pose. But rather than hint that stablecoins might be in trouble, the report conveys that the ECB is figuring out how to mitigate the potential risks.      The issue was becoming urgent, given the explosive increase in stablecoin demand. The total value of stablecoins has now surpassed $18 billion, up from $10 billion just four months ago. Much of this growth has been driven by international demand for dollars as well as the increasingly sophisticated financial tools being built on top of public blockchain technology. USDC, the leading U.S.-based stablecoin, has seen its market cap almost quadruple so far this year, to over $2 billion.      Reading between the lines, the message goes even further. Acceptance is one thing; support is another. The OCC is signaling to banks that stablecoin activity is legitimate, and that reserve accounts will be offered the same federal protections as any other.      This could incentivize banks to actively seek stablecoin business, and in so doing, broaden both their client base and their stake in crypto markets.      A recent statement from the OCC said that U.S. national banks could now custody crypto assets. Presumably that includes stablecoins, too. So, a bank could attract not just stablecoin issuers, but also their clients. It would then make sense to facilitate the transfers of stablecoins between clients, and (why not) even between banks. New payments networks could emerge, which in turn could give rise to a host of new banking services. For an industry squeezed by low interest rates and looming defaults, this potential growth vector will eventually start to look attractive.      And since one of the main use cases today for U.S.-based stablecoin USDC (the second largest stablecoin by market cap) is extracting yield from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, this could be the incentive needed for traditional finance to start to take an open-minded look at the innovations going on in blockchain-based financial applications. New clients could be courted with new types of savings products, which could in turn accelerate the transformation of traditional banking.    Growth and innovation    It could also embolden new types of stablecoin issuers to come forward with further innovations. To those of us working in the industry, it may seem like stablecoin issuers are everywhere. Looking in from the outside, however, most of them are either small, offshore or both. Other than the members of USDC issuer CENTRE Consortium, founded by Coinbase and Circle in 2018, there are few large U.S.-based corporations commercially active in the space.      Last year, we reported that IBM was building support for a network of stablecoin-issuing banks, and that Wells Fargo had created a corporate stablecoin for internal cross-border transfers.      JPMorgan is apparently still working on JPM Coin, also designed for cross-border payments between institutional clients, announced in 2019. Visa is looking at ways to harness the potential of stablecoins for B2B payments. The list goes on, but no large corporation has yet successfully launched a stablecoin with real-world traction. That is likely to change.      Blockchain-based tokens to represent internal transfers is a relatively straightforward application, and just the tip of what’s possible. An as-yet unexplored option is that of programmable monetary instruments, such as stablecoins that have embedded KYC, or stablecoins that could be distributed amongst certain communities for specific uses limited by code. The OCC statement is likely to give momentum to collaboration between corporations and their banks on creative payments and engagement tools.      The fine line between securities and stablecoins with features is no doubt a factor holding back many private projects. There seems to be regulatory progress there, too. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said this week that they are open to discussions with stablecoin issuers as to whether or not their token would classify as a security – which implies that some would not. While not exactly clarity, it does open the regulatory door to more conversations about innovation at the highest levels, as well as case-by-case decisions that, while slow, would at least give a more solid foundation for development.    Gaps and standards    There are barriers, however.      The infrastructure is still young, and although it is growing rapidly in both scope and scalability, the public blockchains on which most current stablecoins run have scalability issues which at times can push up fees to uncomfortable levels. And, given recent progress in payments infrastructure, stablecoin payments may end up being slower than paying by some more traditional methods.  Stablecoin settlement is also still an issue. The U.S. Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) covers settlement finality (a legal construct that defines the point after which a transaction cannot be reversed) for private systems, but does not address the issue of blockchain settlement finality. With proof-of-work blockchains, settlement is probabilistic, not definite, until a certain number of blocks have passed. And even then, time just makes it increasingly unlikely that a transaction can be reversed. At what stage does a blockchain-based transaction become totally irrevocable? This is understandably an important issue for market participants.      And for many use cases, using stablecoins could add a middleman, rather than streamline operations. This could further impact costs, especially if different fiat currencies are at either end of a transaction.      The potential utility in cross-border transfers highlights the need for an international framework if these instruments are to fulfill their potential to streamline flows of capital. Earlier this month, the Governor of the Bank of England called for a G20 mandate for standard-setting bodies to clarify standards.      In April, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published the responses to its public consultation on global stablecoin regulation, which make for constructive reading. While not a regulator, the FSB monitors the global financial system and makes recommendations to protect its stability and integrity, and its work could provide a structure for international cooperation.      And regulators will always be concerned about the fragility risks that growing stablecoin popularity could introduce into the global financial system.    A welcome start    Regulatory clarity of any sort is an underappreciated trigger for innovation. True, the crypto industry has no shortage of creative code and ambitious applications. It also has no shortage of people willing to put time and money into devising new applications for new types of value. And the whirlwind of activity going on in the decentralized finance space is generating astonishing growth – since the start of 2020, value locked in DeFi contracts has increased from roughly $675 million to over $8 billion.      But that is still a small speck in the financial universe. Adoption and impactful applications will not make a meaningful impact on finance until regulatory clarity encourages serious money to take notice.      I struggled to come up with a metaphor that could represent this type of trigger, one that did not involve everything falling down (which means dominoes are out), things blowing up (the spark in the fireworks shed won’t do) or anything to do with viral contagion (because obviously).      In the end, the best I could come up with was a seed that becomes a tree that is so impressive it encourages planters in other regions to plant their own. This image is lacking in oomph and sparkle, but finance moves slowly. And even a forest of new trees would not convey the scale of innovation that we could be on the verge of seeing. It is hopefully a reminder, though, that meaningful and long-lasting change starts small.    A comprehensive crypto industry overview    The University of Cambridge’s latest industry survey is out, with no shortage of surprising findings. This is their third edition, and compiles data from 280 entities from 59 countries, across four market segments: exchange, payments, custody and mining. It’s an insightful overview into how crypto businesses are faring around the world, and highlights some interesting trends.    Full-time employee growth slowed to 21% in 2019, down from 57% in 2018. The decline was especially notable in smaller firms, which implies that a few large players are dominating the industry.  On average, 39% of proof-of-work mining is powered by renewable energy, primarily hydroelectric, while 76% of miners say they use some form of renewables in their energy mix. This is up from 28% and 60%, respectively, in 2018.  Approximately 13% of miners now use financial products such as hashrate or crypto asset derivatives to hedge risks.  Capital expenditures take up to 56% of U.S.-based miner costs, compared to 31% for Chinese miners, which suggests a competitive edge for Chinese miners that could be explained by the concentration of hardware manufacturers in China.  55% of surveyed service providers now support stablecoins, up from 11% in 2018.  An estimate of the number of crypto asset users has been updated to 101 million identified users, up from 35 million in 2018. This is due to an increase in the number of active accounts, and to more rigorous compliance with KYC procedures on the part of service providers.  Service providers operationally headquartered in North America and Europe indicate that business and institutional clients make up 30% of their customers. This figure is much lower for Asia-Pacific and Latin American firms, at 16% and 10% respectively.  Compliance with KYC/AML obligations is heterogeneous across regions. Nearly all customer accounts at European and North American service providers have been KYC’ed, whereas this is the case for only one out of two accounts at service providers based in the Middle East and Africa. The share of crypto asset-only companies that did not conduct any KYC checks at all dropped from 48% to 13% between 2018 and 2020.  46% of service providers report not being insured against any risks. 90% keep crypto asset funds in cold storage. 45% use a third-party crypto custodian as part of their cold storage system.    One of my favorite parts of the report was this chart, which color-codes the importance crypto service providers assign to various trends emerging in the industry. Stablecoins win, not surprisingly. Staking and security tokens got less interest than I expected. And the relative lack of interest in non-fungible tokens hints that the recent market buzz around the concept may be short-lived.      A recommendable and eye-opening read.    Anyone know what's going on yet?    This week’s sell off in equity markets felt different from previous half-hearted declines. The scope, combined with the intensifying concern in various media around the likelihood of a contested U.S. election, a disappointing vaccine and repeated lockdowns, feels more like a change of sentiment that could, in the absence of generous stimulus checks, snowball into genuine worry about the state of the global economy.      Related to this, I’ve spent some time recently wondering what will drive the stock markets after the pandemic is over. Rebuilding? Infrastrtucture hasn’t been damaged. Consumption? Many spending habits will have permanently changed. And what of all the companies that can’t support employee costs once federal aid is not on the table?      Of course there will be success stories, and of course emerging technologies will continue to present growth plays. But are the future earnings that current valuations are pointing to realistic?      Bitcoin fared better than most other assets this past week, but that’s not saying much.      This feels like a good time to revisit bitcoin’s volatility compared to gold and the S&P 500.      Given the swings in the BTC price over the past week, it’s not surprising that volatility is edging up. Gold’s volatility, on the other hand, is edging down.      To further confuse the narrative, the 60d correlation between the natural log returns of BTC and gold continues to increase, while the correlation with the S&P 500 is holding steady. For now.      (Note: Nothing in this newsletter is investment advice. The author owns some bitcoin and ether.)    CHAIN LINKS    The flow of bitcoin onto Ethereum continues to astonish – this week the market value of bitcoin that has been adapted to work on the Ethereum blockchain passed $1 billion. TAKEAWAY: I’ve written about the phenomenon of Ethereum-based bitcoin before, and am not surprised to see this level of growth. Why would anyone want to put their BTC on Ethereum, you ask? Because Ethereum-based tokens can participate in the myriad decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols that pay yields on deposits. Yes, BTC can earn a yield. There are risks – DeFi is still a young, niche application with counterparty and technology risk, as well as regulatory uncertainty. But for many, the yield and the innovation are compelling.      The most liquid bitcoin-on-Ethereum token is wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), managed by crypto custodian BitGo. There are other options, however, such as tBTC, which this week relaunched with a system that relies on a decentralized network of nodes, wallets and smart contracts.      This week alone, over $170 million was added to wBTC, according to btconethereum.com. Investment fund Three Arrows Capital accounted for almost $25 million-worth of that, setting an individual wBTC transaction record just one week after Alameda Research minted almost $22 million worth. (Update: Alameda then upped Three Arrows Capital's transaction, and I've given up trying to keep up.)      Now, the concept is spreading to other blockchains: BitGo will enable wBTC on the Tron blockchain, with the aim of boosting its decentralized finance ecosystem. Tron currently has much lower fees than Ethereum – but the persistent popularity of stablecoins on Ethereum vs. Tron shows that the market on the whole doesn’t seem to mind.      The Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2020, introduced this week by Rep. Michael Conaway (R-Texas), seeks to create a federal definition of “digital commodity exchanges,” putting them in their own legal category and charging the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with oversight. TAKEAWAY: If passed, this would finally establish a regulator for cryptocurrencies. So far, they’ve been languishing in no-man’s land, which has hindered market infrastructure development. Many U.S.-based institutions cannot transact on an unregulated exchange, which puts crypto exchanges out of bounds: They may be licensed, but without a regulator, they are unregulated. Federal regulation would also ease many of the burdens U.S.-based crypto exchanges face, such as the need to go state by state for permission to transact.      The European Commission has proposed a bill that would provide clarity on crypto asset definitions, rules on digital asset custody as well as details on what the relationship between token issuers and holders should be. If passed, this would turn the EU into the largest and most significant regulated space for cryptocurrencies anywhere in the world. TAKEAWAY: The regulatory clarity is coming thick and fast these days. This is good news for an asset group that promises global access. Institutional support for that global access will boost funding, infrastructure investment and, eventually, adoption.      Social Capital, a California-based investment firm that purchased bitcoin in 2013, is considering going public.TAKEAWAY: The firm, which specializes in technology startups, earlier this month filed three new Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) with the SEC, bringing his firm’s total up to six. It also announced that one of the SPACs was merging with Opendoor (his first merged with Virgin Atlantic earlier this year) and hinted in an interview that he is thinking of taking the whole firm public. If this comes to pass, it would be the first publicly traded venture capital and private equity fund manager with a significant market value to invest in cryptocurrency. It is unclear how much bitcoin Social Capital owns, but an investor letter in 2018 said that one of Social Capital’s largest investments was in bitcoin, so – considering when it was first bought – it’s probably quite a lot.  Some veteran FX traders are moving into the cryptocurrency space because of its volatility. TAKEAWAY: A reminder that volatility is not necessarily bad. We tend to equate volatility with risk (I’ve written about this before), which has negative connotations – you don’t often hear about investment advisors talking about risk to the upside. But high volatility means swings up as well as swings down, and seasoned traders pride themselves on their ability to harness the upside while protecting the downside. The growth of hedging instruments and the smoother flows on market infrastructure make the volatility more manageable than back in the early days. Inexperienced traders can truly suffer, though, as volatility can turn against you at a moment's notice.      The cryptocurrency money manager Panxora seeks to raise up to $50 million for a new hedge fund to buy digital tokens associated with the fast-growing decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. TAKEAWAY: So far, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens have been the purview of crypto enthusiasts and some professional investors chasing higher yields. This type of fund is one of the first but is unlikely to be the last that hopes to bring institutional money into the space. Whether the market’s liquidity can handle that kind of volume remains to be seen. According to crypto data provider Messari, the total reported market cap of DeFi tokens is over $5 billion, with over $600 million in 24-hr trading volume, so it can probably handle an inflow of $50 million without too much chaos. This is worth watching, though, as the next funds of this ilk might be more ambitious.      The Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) has accepted its first crypto asset exchange-traded fund (ETF), Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF. TAKEAWAY: The BMX is not a large stock exchange – its aggregate market cap is just under $300 million. A total of 3 million shares is available via private placement at $1,000 each. So, doing the math, this ETF – if completely sold – would multiply the market cap of the entire stock exchange by more than 10x. I don’t want to be a downer, but isn’t that a bit ambitious?
