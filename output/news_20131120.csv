42376722,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cl7V,1384971298,"Polish Bitcoin Exchange Bidextreme.pl Hacked, Bitcoin and Litecoin Wallets Emptied","Poland’s digital currency exchange Bidextreme.pl has been hacked and its customers’ bitcoin and litecoin wallets have been emptied.  In a statement published on its website, the platform said it decided to temporarily suspend all activities until the matter is resolved. The incident was reported to the law enforcement authorities, the company said.  The amount of digital currency stolen was not disclosed by the platform, which was founded in 2013.  Local observers say the attack could hamper the development of Poland’s bitcoin market, even though bitcoin trading is becoming increasingly popular in Poland and the number of companies accepting payment for services and goods in bitcoins is steadily rising.  The incident, which took place on 18th November, follows a similar attack that happened a week earlier in the Czech Republic.  Czech bitcoin exchange Bitcash.cz  was hacked and up to 4,000 customers’ wallets were emptied, after which, the company’s site was shut down.  A statement from Bidextreme.pl said:  ""Should the [digital currency] be retrieved, it will be returned to the users according to the balance from 17th November 2013. The users’ funds which were deposited on the platform’s bank accounts are safe.”  Mariusz Pilas, chief executive of Magnus Ltd, which owns Bidextreme.pl, released a statement in which he revealed that the platform’s development plans had been put on hold following the attack.  ""We deeply regret that we need to temporarily suspend the Bidextreme.pl platform whose [market] potential had been developing at an impressive growth rate,” Pilas said. ""This caused a great financial loss for us as well.”  In his statement, the chief executive said his company has begun to return the funds that its users deposited in Polish zloty (PLN) on the platform’s bank account.  According to the chief executive, Magnus Ltd has a total worth that exceeds the budget of Bidextreme.pl and the value of the stolen digital currency ""many times”. Pilas added:  ""Magnus Ltd is successfully carrying out high-budget projects co-financed by the European Union for public entities, and is enjoying their confidence.""  The company is headquartered in the city of Olsztyn, Poland, located in the country’s northeast. The Economic Crimes Department of the Municipal Police in Olsztyn is currently investigating the case, Pilas said.  According to the company's website, Magnus is developing training and educational projects for the elderly and the unemployed. Its other areas of activity include advisory services, debt recovery and educational services.  Meanwhile, the handling of the case could be further complicated by the fact that the question of bitcoin’s legal status still has not been resolved in Poland.  A policy document signed by the country’s Deputy Minister of Finance Wojciech Kowalczyk and released in July outlines the ministry’s stance on the use of bitcoins in financial transactions carried out in the Polish market.  The document states that, under Polish law, bitcoins cannot be considered a currency, as they currently are not universally treated as a currency by Poles.  In spite of this, transactions made in bitcoins are nevertheless subject to taxation, according to the ministry.  Local news daily Gazeta Wyborcza reported that, prior to the attack on the company’s site, Bidextreme.pl was the second largest digital currency exchange platform in Poland.  According to data obtained from Bitcoincharts on 20th November, Bidextreme.pl had a 30-day volume of 199.71 BTC and 186,469 PLN ($59,670). The platform’s six-month volume was 540.48 BTC and 315,777 PLN ($101,048).  In comparison, according to the same source, local bitcoin exchange Bitcurex.pl had on 20th November a 30-day volume of 37,955 BTC and 42.48m PLN ($13.6m).  Set up in 2012, Bitcurex.pl is operated by local firm Digital Future, headquartered in the city of Łódź, Poland.  The incident is not the first case of major bitcoin loss in Poland.  In July 2011, users of local bitcoin exchange Bitomat.pl lost all their digital currency due to a system failure which erased all the user data from the platform’s server, resulting in the loss of some 17,000 bitcoins.  The website was subsequently shut down and its domain taken over by Mt. Gox.  The acquisition allowed the Tokyo-based business to become a major local player after it migrated Bitomat.pl’s users’ accounts into its system.  Prior to the incident, the Polish website was believed to be the world's third largest bitcoin exchange at that time.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LTC | REGULATION,Jaroslaw Adamowski,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/20/polish-bitcoin-exchange-bidextremepl-hacked-bitcoin-and-litecoin-wallets-emptied,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6297091a013b339b14288568419ae5dc1e4d4493-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376717,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ckzx,1384965051,Gaming Company to Pay $1 Million for Secretly Using Customer Computers for Bitcoin Mining,"The New Jersey Attorney General’s office said on Tuesday (19th November) that it had reached a $1m settlement with New York-based gaming company E-Sports Entertainment, which admitted in April this year that it had experimented with injecting bitcoin mining code into its users’ computers.  Named in the settlement order as being responsible for the malicious code were E-Sports' co-founder Eric Thunberg and software engineer Sean Hunczak, whose programming efforts reportedly allowed E-Sports employees ""full administrative access to users’ computers"" and allowed access to files, screen captures, mouse movements and monitor activity.  The software, which cost users $6.95 a month to use, watched their activity to see when they were active and what software they were using to take advantage of lulls in their GPU usage and mine for bitcoins.  During a two-week period back in April, the company reportedly mined a total of 29 bitcoins, (currently valued at around $15,000) which they subsequently donated to the American Cancer Charity; a sum around the order of $4,000 at the time.  In addition, the settlement order claims that, in at least some of the instances, ""ESEA employers used the software to copy files from ESEA end-users’ computers"" with the Attorney General adding:  ""The company violated state consumer and computer abuse laws by putting malware on users’ computers, spying on them, and accessing their computers without their knowledge with the mining code.""  The issue was first spotted by ScRaPPyCoCo on a thread on E-Sport's website, with their first response to the controversy appearing on 1st May, reading:  ""With the whole fervor around bitcoin, we did conduct some internal tests with the client on only two of our own, consenting administrators’ accounts to see how the mining process worked and determine whether it was a feature that we might want to add in the future. We thought this might be an exciting new tool that we could provide to our community. Ultimately, we decided that it was not.""  They went on to claim that they had killed the project, but discovered that ""an employee who was involved in the test"" had been using the test code for his own personal gain since 13th April.  E-Sports is required to pay the New Jersey state $325,000 of its $1 million settlement obligation whilst the remainder is suspended for 10 years, and will be vacated in the event that company abides fully by the settlement terms and avoids any future legal violations.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Richard Boase,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/20/gaming-company-to-pay-1-million-for-secretly-using-customer-computers-for-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5373b259a9813c03e58c18d40edd958a16af866b-1000x696.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376727,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6clA1,1384957213,Litecoin Spikes to $200 Million Market Capitalization in Five Hours,"At 17:00 GMT on 7th November, alt-currency litecoin reached its first $100m market cap milestone with approximately 23m litecoins in circulation, trading at a high of $4.40.  On 18th November at 17:45 GMT, litecoin crossed the $10 mark after spiking over 100% in approximately five hours bringing the litecoin market cap to well over $200m.  At the time of writing the price of a single litecoin has retreated to approximately $5.60.  Back in March and April this year, litecoin caught the market’s attention when it spiked approximately 10,000% in a few weeks.  The rise, which happened during the bitcoin bubble when the price of BTC rose from $15 to $266, saw litecoin’s value rise from approximately $0.05 to $5.00, and then correct to around $2.50 a couple of weeks later.  While most of the altcoins have not appreciated quite as consistently as bitcoin in the last few weeks, it seems as if their relative lag might be par for the course, catching up as investors try to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolios in an attempt to protect themselves from what many view as an inevitable crash after an historic high.  Litecoin’s sudden spike in value may be coming on as investors and traders new to the cryptocurrency scene discover a plethora of exotic financial instruments, or it may be the collective voices of the cryptocurrency hardcore who lend their support to litecoin for ideological and technical reasons.  RT’s Max Keiser lead the charge earlier this week with his tweet:    We are initiated coverage of litecoin with an interim target of $50. Newest @KeiserReport features one of the biggest players in LC      — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) November 18, 2013    The lure of a bitcoin alternative  Litecoin’s pull as an alternative to bitcoin lies partly in its alleged faster confirmation times for transactions, which makes it an attractive prospect for businesses, and partly in its democratic design.  It was formulated by inventor Charles Lee to be resistant to ASIC mining, employing a scrypt encryption algorithm that requires miners to rely on expensive RAM in the mining hardware.  According to Lee, this makes for a broadly fairer playing field and avoids the problem of centralisation that ASICs pose to the bitcoin mining industry, where power is increasingly concentrated in a few hands.  The fundamental premise of litecoin was to keep mining a democratic process, keeping the barrier to entry low and affordable.  Some believe that this is even closer to Satoshi’s original vision than bitcoin and have put their full weight behind it. There have been both criticisms of and praise for litecoin's approach, with one group claiming:  “Litecoin is designed to be inefficient on all common computer components (both CPUs and GPUs) meaning that a malicious entity need only produce a small batch of specialized/custom hardware to overtake all the commodity mining systems combined.”  Another group refutes that argument, claiming:  “Scrypt is not designed to be inefficient, but is instead designed to be highly dependent on memory bandwidth. Since the high-speed cache RAM on modern processors already takes up most of the die space, no sizeable improvement could then be made by creating custom chips.”  It has long been posited that litecoin is silver to bitcoin’s gold, but there’s no clarity on whether this is a fair or reasonable comparison to make at present as litecoin is only just over two years old, and still has an immature market.  The other altcurrency options  Other currencies such as Namecoin (NMC) and Peercoin (PPC) are enjoying some added attention and appreciation as money filters out of the bitcoin ecosystem into more speculative fields.  Namecoin, the currency that was created to support a censorship resistant peer-to-peer DNS system saw a spike in value in the last two days, as did the recently popular peercoin, which has risen to third place in Coinmarketcap's market capital chart in the last few months.  Peercoin, created by anonymous cypherpunk Sunny King was theoretically designed to be energy efficient and lightweight, relying on a hybrid ‘proof of stake/proof of work’ scheme that incentivises its holders by rewarding them with transaction fees from the network after coins have been mined.  This year has seen a slew of new crypto-currencies entering the market, offering a host of slightly different innovations, each hoping to exploit a different ecological niche in the new crypto-economy.  Another example, primecoin, offers a proof of work algorithm that depends on mining complex arrangements of prime numbers, a function that its anonymous creator (again, Sunny King) argues is broadly useful for science and technology.

42376720,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cl4z,1384953602,Over $1 Million Raised for Bail of Alleged Silk Road Owner Ross Ulbricht,"Friends and family of Ross Ulbricht have raised more than $1m to pledge as bail money for the release of the alleged Silk Road owner.  The 29-year-old was arrested in early October and the FBI closed down the online black market, which was hosted on the so-called 'dark web' and was used to buy and sell drugs, weapons and other illegal goods and services.  A letter, dated 19th November, from Ulbricht’s defence attorney Joshua Dratel asks Southern District of New York judge Kevin Fox to grant Ulbricht bail at his upcoming hearing, which is scheduled for 21st November at 11:00 ET.  The letter details that, if released, Ulbricht will live with his aunt in New York. It also lists a number of reasons why the attorney believes Ulbricht should be granted bail, including:  Mr Ulbricht's peaceful character and reputation for fulfilling his obligations, as set forth in letters from his family and friends who stand by him despite the allegations.  Dratel also highlights that Ulbricht is not likely to flee the US, doesn't have a criminal record and is charitable in nature – he founded a company that donated books to prison libraries.  He writes that Ulbricht, who allegedly went by the name of Dread Pirate Roberts, has been held in solitary confinement at Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center and has been denied access to Corrlinks, a prison email system.  Friend and family support  The letter details some of the comments about Ulbricht from his friends and family, with one friend stating that, even from a young age, Ulbricht ""demonstrated a positive character, responsibility, and commitment to his studies and family"".  More than 20 people have offered to pledge assets to assure his presence at future court hearings and his compliance with any condition the court imposes.  Those pledging their assets include his parents, sister, aunts, family friends and school friends.  Ulbricht's parents have said they will pledge $700,000 in equity from their home, while his sister will pledge her savings of $36,600 and his aunt is offering up her home, in which she has $200,000 in equity.  Dratel's 15-page letter concludes:  Accordingly, for all the reasons set forth above, it is respectfully submitted that the Court should grant bail in Mr Ulbricht's case, and impose any restrictive conditions the Court deems necessary.    Ulbricht Bail Letter by ag1838    The size of Silk Road  According to the Feds' criminal complaint against Ulbricht, Silk Road processed sales of around 9.5m BTC between February 2011 and July this year.  When Ulbricht was arrested, the FBI seized 26,000 BTC, which, at the current price, is worth over $11.6m.  After Ulbricht's first court hearing, on 6th November, Dratel indicated to reporters that his client is not the creator of Silk Road.  ""The evidence can’t establish that he is who they say he is, or that he’s done what they say he’s done,"" Dratel said.  He also labelled Ulbricht a ""poster boy for bail,” and added that he would be willing to consider measures such as electronic monitoring.  Dratel has defended a number of relatively high-profile clients in the past, including Wadih el Hage, an Al Qaeda associate who was convicted of helping to orchestrate the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed a total of 224 people.  He also became the first civilian attorney to defend a Guantanamo case when he took on David Hicks as a client. Hicks was tried in Guantanamo Bay having been accused of fighting for the Taliban in Afghanistan.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/20/over-1-million-raised-for-bail-of-alleged-silk-road-owner-ross-ulbricht,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1dd9018aa21b13c7f4f9a7ead785eb66585a5d9f-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376719,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cl2T,1384946129,Bitcoin Faces Regulatory Push in Senate Banking Committee Hearing,"View the full video of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs hearing on virtual currencies here.  It was refreshing to see a Senate hearing kick off half an hour early for a change, and in a place with far more sitting room than room 538 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. Just before 15:00 ET, while aides were still preparing that room for the two-hour session, Senator Jerry Moran posted a question on reddit:  “I’m one of the Senators attending today's US Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin. What would you like me to know?”  He wanted wider input on what senators would be discussing yesterday afternoon: the promises and threats of virtual currencies, and how the banking system could engage them.  While academics, regulators, and banking industry representatives gave their views to a panel of Senators, redditors responded. The difference in opinion and tone was obvious. Most of the discussion in the hearing (other than BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi’s comments) focused on the risks around bitcoin and how to best regulate it to mitigate those risks. But like Gallippi’s a lot of the reddit feedback centred on the need to let it breathe.  “The situation for entrepreneurs looking to build startups around bitcoin seems pretty bleak here in the US,” said one reddit commenter, a developer in San Francisco who regularly attends bitcoin meetups. “It seems like the most rational decision if you want to build a business is to decide that you're going to have to leave the US to do so.”  There’s just one problem, said Dax Hansen, an attorney at Perkins Coie LLP, who has become a specialist in virtual currency law: “It’s not a very rational discussion right now.”  An irrational discussion  Many bitcoin companies are prepared, with good answers, says Hansen. If the banks would listen, they have compelling stories to tell. But many banks aren’t listening. “It’s not even the regulatory issue that’s the problem. It’s the banking relationships that are the problem,” he explained.  Yesterday’s hearing may not have done much to encourage bitcoin advocates. The person who advocated for more regulation of bitcoin, and who seemed the most cautious about virtual currency, was Paul Smocer. He is the president of BITS, the technology policy division of The Financial Services Roundtable – an industry body set up by the financial services industry to explore approaches to new technologies.  Smocer didn’t respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment, but his testimony yesterday called for more regulation, rather than less.  He praised Gallippi in the hearing’s Q&A session for putting the necessary controls in place to know who his clients were and prevent illicit transactions. But he qualified his statement:  “I would question if that is applicable across the industry, and whether there are things we can make sure to ensure that the kinds of litigations and controls that he has put in place are applicable to all.""  Earlier, he had called for more regulation to “legitimize” the virtual currency industry, arguing that the FinCEN guidance in March wasn’t enough.  FinCEN’s guidelines explain what types of virtual currency business fall under the auspices of the Bank Secrecy Act guidelines, and refer to well-established definitions of money transmission businesses. So what’s making banks nervous?  Gallippi’s BitPay co-founder, CTO Stephen Pair, argued that more clarity is needed. “It is precisely the lack of clarity around regulations that is causing banks to take a very cautious approach to bitcoin,” he says. “There are many banks that want to make use of the Bitcoin technology but they are unsure how regulators will react.”  State regulation is a hurdle  State-level regulation is also a bone of contention. David Cotney, Commissioner of Banks for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is also vice-chair at the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), which gathers together all of the state banking regulators in the US. He reeled off a list of initiatives and tools that the CSBS is using to try and make the state-level MSB licensing process easier.  The Money Transmitter Regulators Association (MTRA), a non-profit organisation that helps regulate the money transmission business in the US, created a Money Transmitter Regulators Cooperative Agreement in 2002, and followed it up with the MTRA Examination Protocol (MTRA Protocol) in 2010, he said. That gives companies an easier time when applying for state licenses by co-ordinating joint reviews. There’s a task force, too, and a database, that lets the public see how those licenses are going.  But none of that seems to be helping bitcoin companies who want to operate in multiple states. Once they conquer California, Texas, and New York, they still have 75% of the US population to go, and each one has a different set of rules, standards, and politics to navigate. Each one will take up to two years to complete. No wonder Circle Internet Financial earmarked $2m of its $9m in funding to tackle it.  The feds could help, if they wanted to, said Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation and a contributing editor at CoinDesk. He argued:    “It’s not going to be an easy and a short process, but they could have federal laws that would pre-empt the state laws.      There could be court rulings and supreme court rulings that would override some issues of the states, and they could have a unified approach on it if they wanted to.”    In any case, he says, perhaps it shouldn’t be an MSB issue at all.  But there is opposition to unification. Sarah Jane Hughes, university scholar and fellow in commercial law at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, thinks that virtual currencies should be treated just the same as any other financial instrument when it comes to regulation, however. She gave four recommendations in her testimony, and one of them included not creating a unified state/federal regulation for them, or to give them special regulatory treatment to foster innovation.  Persuading the banks  Aside from the challenge of state-level regulation, and the danger of more regulation for a volatile currency, there’s the problem of making it worth the banks’ while in the face of the regulatory uncertainty.  “The banks need a business case, honestly. They need to know that they’re going to make some money off of this, and right now it seems probably like a nascent industry,” argued Hansen.  The problem for banks is that bitcoin may be flirting with a $600 valuation, but they’re not going to see much of it, at least in the short term, he suggests, even if they open up to bitcoin companies. “How do the banks make money there?”  Banks normally earn money from deposits, but they’re not well equipped to deal with virtual currency transactions. They live in the world of credit cards and ACH, where fees are deliciously high, but in the bitcoin world, low fees are a characteristic of the system.  [post-quote]  If the carrot won’t work, then how about the stick? “More impetus could come from large merchants asking their banks to support them doing business in bitcoin,” Dax said. BitPay now has 12,000 merchants and just launched a directory of them – but banks either need a few big players to push for bitcoin, or an en masse request from lots of smaller companies – before they’ll take notice.  Assuming that all of this can be solved, banks will need to make it straightforward for bitcoin-based businesses to sign up for accounts. In his Q&A during Monday’s Homeland Security and Government Oversight hearing on virtual currency, Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck called for an ""onboarding"" process.  “There is currently a chill in the banking industry that is preventing businesses from getting even to simple checking accounts,” Murck said on Monday. “There are stories that if you have bitcoin in your name or documentation, your application goes in the circular file.”  A checklist of due diligence measures would help here, says Hansen. “There are many bitcoin companies ready and waiting.”  At last one virtual currency company is anxiously waiting to align itself with banks and financial institutions. The Ripple Foundation, whose CEO Chris Larsen was originally scheduled to testify at the hearings, takes pains to outline its readiness.  A statement from the company said:  “Ripple in particular is well-suited to today’s regulations because many of the gateways on our systems will likely be banks and other financial institutions that already work within this set of regulations.”  But Ripple’s absence left Gallippi as the only person actually operating a virtual currency business to testify at the hearing. He argued against any further regulation of bitcoin.  “Guidance from the IRS, Department of Treasury, Department of Justice, and SEC has all established that bitcoins are legal, and that those dealing with them must simply follow existing tax laws and anti-money laundering regulations,” he said.  But more regulation could be on the horizon. Both Hughes and Mercedes Kelley Tunstall, partner and practice leader for the Privacy and Data Security Group at Ballard Spahr LLP, testified yesterday that virtual currencies face volatility issues. Bitcoin fails to track other currencies, said Hughes, raising the question of securities or commodities regulation for it.  Catch-22  Part of the reason that the currency is so volatile is because of a lack of liquidity. Volatility is a product of thin markets, and adding more liquidity would help to regulate prices. Regulatory uncertainty and conservative banks are precisely what are preventing US exchanges from increasing that liquidity by participating fully in the virtual currency markets.  “The number one exchange for bitcoin in the world is in China. The number two exchange is in Japan. Numbers three, four, and five are in Europe. Number six is in Canada. America is not a leader right now in liquidity in the exchange of bitcoin,” said Gallippi.  So, what is needed? A light-handed approach is crucial, said Stan Stalnaker, founding member of the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA). “This will allow the digital asset ecosystem to develop to its full potential,” he said. “An enormous amount of wealth creation is possible, along with the reduction of fraud and money-laundering through digital identification related to these assets.”  It is unclear how much legislative action will come from this process, if any, but one thing is certain: senators were given a clear message from the banking industry yesterday that they were skeptical about bitcoin. It was not the dialogue that many on reddit may have hoped for.

CEO Tomer Zussman sent CoinDesk the following statement:  ""We never expected this kind of exposure at this early stage. The kiosks are working very well with all other products but we didn't expect what happened with Bitcoin in few days. The volume and demand were very high and we had to reevaluate the process and the technical challenges.  We are working very hard in order to bring Bitcoin back to the kiosks and we will announce it as soon as possible.""  ————————————————–  Weary travelers across the world will soon be able to convert their leftover change into bitcoin at the airport.  Vending machines from Travelers Box, a Gibraltar-registered startup, lets travelers add their unused foreign currency to their bitcoin wallets, or other online accounts like PayPal or Qiwi.  Travelers Box currently only has a presence at Ataturk airport in Turkey, but the company has plans for global expansion, with five other locations coming by the end of 2013.  “Our business helps travelers to utilize their leftover change and we think that having the possibility of converting the cash into bitcoin and use it later to purchase products or services overseas is right,” said Travelers Boxhttp://www.travelersbox.com/ CEO Tomer Zussman in an email.  The company was registered in Gibraltar in November 2012, with the first kiosk appearing in Turkey in April 2013.  Mt. Gox  ’s exchange rate is used for bitcoin deposits and the company takes a fee on all transactions based on the amount deposited, though Zussman said they hope to move to a no-fee approach in future.  Zussman declined to say what other locations are coming this year, but said they are in the process of expanding to other airports in Turkey and that the coming locations outside of Turkey include “one of the most well-known airports in the east and another one is in China”.  “We are working closely with the regulators in every country as the situation is different from country to country. We limit the amount a passenger can deposit based on local regulations,” he said.  Travelers Box is in discussion with 40 airports worldwide, he added.  He welcomed the US Senate’s recent hearing on bitcoin, but also pointed to the “progress in the Chinese market”, mirroring the comments of the head of the Bitcoin Foundation Jon Matonis (who is also a CoinDesk contributing editor), who warned that the US has already “ceded dominance” in bitcoin trading.  According to Redditor eyal0, who encountered the Travelers Box kiosk in Turkey earlier this month, the machine was after security in international departures, meaning that you would need to have booked a flight to use it.  Connecting bitcoin with international travel and currency exchange gets right to the heart of one of the oft-cited benefits of bitcoin: its utility as a means of money transfer.  Austin and Beccy Craig, this year spent 100 days living on bitcoin, during which time they travelled from the US to Singapore, Sweden and Germany, but not once did they need to turn their money into local currency.  A more serious example was the spike in the price of bitcoin associated with the implementation of currency controls in Cyprus in March 2013. Bitcoin was a means for Cypriots to move their money across borders and into other currencies when traditional channels were closed.  Travelers Box also allows users to add money to gift cards associated with their email address for stores like Amazon, eBay, iTunes and Google Play.  You can also donate your leftover coins and notes to charities including Greenpeace, PETA and WWF.
