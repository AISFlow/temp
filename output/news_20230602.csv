42420308,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUevef,1685749250,Crypto Lender Celsius’ $800M Ether Staking Shake-Up Stretches Ethereum Validator Queue to 44 Days,"Embattled crypto lender Celsius Network is shaking up its ether (ETH) staking strategy, congesting the already month-long queue to activate new validators on the Ethereum network.  Over the course of two days, the firm has been diligently moving ETH into staking contracts after redeeming some $813 million of staked ETH from liquid staking leader Lido Finance. Since June 1, Celsius has deposited some $745 million of ETH, data by Arkham Intelligence shows.  The transfers have stretched the already long queue to establish new validators on the Ethereum network to 44 days, with Celsius potentially responsible for almost a week of extra time, Tom Wan, analyst at crypto investment product manager 21Shares noted.  The transactions are the latest development in the lender’s maneuver to reshuffle its staked ETH stash since Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade enabled withdrawals from staking contracts in April. At that time, Celsius held some 460,000 of ETH – now worth $870 million – staked with liquid staking platform Lido Finance and some 160,000 tokens – about $300 million at current prices – deployed in its own staking pool.  The transfers have occurred as the firm restructures after filing for bankruptcy protection in July, when it succumbed to liquidity issues due to plummeting cryptocurrency prices and a wave of user withdrawals. Last week, the U.S. bankruptcy court auctioned the lender to winning bidder Fahrenheit, an investment group backed by Arrington Capital that will assume the firm’s assets, including its institutional loan portfolio, staked cryptocurrencies and crypto mining units.  Celsius’ staking maneuvers  The lender’s maneuver to shake up its staking allocations started with staking some $75 million of its available ETH stash with non-custodial, institutional staking service Figment, CoinDesk reported.  Celsius also requested to redeem its 460,000 staked ETH from Lido as soon as the platform allowed withdrawals. It has already reclaimed 428,000 tokens, worth $813 million. Celsius split the assets into two separate crypto addresses that the firm previously used to stake with Figment and to deposit in its own staking pool, blockchain data shows. The lender is still waiting to receive 32,000 ETH from Lido.  On Thursday, the firm moved a total of 291,000 ETH, worth $553 million, into staking contracts, according to a Dune Analytics chart by 21Shares. A total of 192,000 tokens were deposited into the Celsius staking pool, while 99,000 tokens were staked with Figment, Wan reported.  On Friday, the company resumed moving tokens into staking contracts, putting it on track to stake all the 428,000 ETH stash. At the time of publication, the firm had staked some $199 million of ETH via Figment and deposited some $12 million to the Celsius staking pool, Arkham data shows.  After the transfers, Celsius wallets still held some $109 million in ETH, according to Arkham.  Ethereum stakers wait  Staking allows the beleaguered lender to earn rewards on digital asset holdings while the withdrawal freeze on user deposits is in effect.  However, it also significantly stresses an already crowded queue to add new validators on the Ethereum network. Validators are entities in a proof-of-stake blockchain, who stake tokens to guard the network and oversee transactions in exchange for a reward.  Demand for staking has increased dramatically since the Shanghai upgrade activated on April 12. Deposits surpassed withdrawals by almost $5.5 billion, leaving new entrants with a month-long wait time to set up validators, data by blockchain intelligence firm Nansen shows.  Celsius’ latest staking deposits further stretched the queue. The estimated time to clear the queue now stands at 44 days and one hour, according to Ethereum tracking website Wenmerge.  If Celsius commits all the 428,000 tokens to staking, it will add six days and 15 hours to the waiting time, increasing to 45 days, Wan predicted on Thursday.  “Staking activation queue up only,” pseudonymous blockchain sleuth Alto, who was first to report Celsius’ transfer to staking wallets, tweeted.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ARKM,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/02/crypto-lender-celsius-800m-ether-staking-shake-up-stretches-ethereum-validator-queue-to-44-days,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b9f6b578d398244eba6a98356899e0f8cb15580-1428x686.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This spike has been largely unique to Avalanche in the alternative L1 smart contract market. Valuation metrics are a bit mixed, but against peers, AVAX is cheap by comparison. When I last covered Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) in early January, I noted there were positive signs despite a lack of growth in network activity. Those positive signs included attractive valuation metrics compared to peers. In this Avalanche update, I'll provide an updated look at some of the activity and valuation metrics I've been sharing with BlockChain Reaction subscribers over the last few weeks. Network Activity Total transactions on Avalanche more than doubled from 4.2 million in March to over 9.3 million in April. The transaction growth trend continued in May with a 32% month-over-month increase to 12.3 million transactions. Looking at the daily transaction data from IntoTheBlock on the same chart as AVAX price really shows the divergence between AVAX and the activity on the network. This is unusual considering there has been a clear correlation between the two in the past and AVAX is the gas utility token of the network. Avalanche (Into The Block) Going back through more than two and half years of network history, we've rarely had such a large divergence in daily transactions and price as we do right now. The last time the divergence was this large was in May 2022 before the Terra (LUNC-USD) collapse. At that time, the divergence started when activity and price were both near highs, this time we have the opposite. Daily average transactions have doubled over the last several weeks, and AVAX's token price simply isn't reflecting that move. This is fairly unique to non-Ethereum (ETH-USD) ecosystem chains. From a daily user standpoint, the activity spike is very evident compared to other alternative networks: Daily Active Users (Token Terminal) When we look at daily active users over the last 6 months through Token Terminal, Avalanche is a standout versus chains like Cosmos Hub ( ATOM-USD ) or MultiversX ( EGLD-USD ) as those networks don't have sustained increases in DAUs that started in early April. I picked these two chains as comps because they share a similar DAU baseline and help illustrate that it is indeed something unique to Avalanche that is taking place. Finding where that activity is coming from is always part of the challenge. Much of it is probably explained by the NFT sales on Avalanche. That figure has spiked roughly 600% from just under 400k in March to over 2.7 million in April. May saw over 2 million NFT sales as well but came in slightly under the April total: Avalanche NFTs (Dune Analytics/subinium) Elsewhere, Avalanche's deployed contracts made an absolutely enormous jump higher over the last two months as well: Avalanche Contracts (Dune Analytics/subinium) Month-over-month deployed contracts moved up from 887k in March to nearly 7.6 million in April - which is more contracts deployed on Avalanche than on Ethereum, Arbitrum (ARB-USD), and Optimism (OP-USD) combined. That figure came down to a little under 3 million in May. But the activity on the chain remains highly elevated compared to previous levels. Valuation From a valuation standpoint, things are a bit more mixed. In my last Avalanche article, we looked at price to sales ratios and market cap to TVL ratios for chain comparisons. From a DeFi standpoint, you could argue Avalanche is actually a bit more expensive compared to January when it had an MC/TVL ratio now near 4: TVL Rank Network Protocols TVL Stables MC/TVL 1 Ethereum 807 $27.22b $68.94b 8.28 2 Tron 22 $5.58b $45.21b 1.22 3 Binance 606 $4.44b $5.68b 10.87 4 Arbitrum 343 $2.36b $1.83b 0.63 5 Polygon 425 $1.02b $1.53b 8.17 6 Optimism 142 $884.24m $607.69m 1.02 7 Avalanche 307 $705.93m $1.33b 6.94 8 Mixin 9 $403.67m $29.34m 9 Cronos 98 $341.93m $5,860 4.37 10 Pulse 6 $336.21m Source: DeFi Llama That figure is now closer to 7. However, despite the increase in MC/TVL Avalanche is still cheaper than Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), Binance ( BNB-USD ), and Ethereum by comparison. Switching from pure DeFi valuations to a more all-encompassing network activity figure, we can look at the updated price to sales comps: Fully Diluted P/S (Token Terminal) Here we see AVAX is now trading at 642 times sales. This is a big improvement from the 2000x multiple where AVAX was trading in early January, and it makes it one of the cheaper L1 networks by fully diluted P/S after Ethereum and Optimism. AVAX is now cheaper than Binance, Fantom (FTM-USD), and Arbitrum. Risks Avalanche remains an inflationary token at this juncture. Even though the coin supply does have a cap, that supply won't be fully unlocked until 2030. Due to the somewhat low 48% circulating supply compared to other competing alternative Layer 1 networks, holders may want to consider some form of yield generation on their AVAX to combat that inflation. According to Staking Rewards, network delegators can currently generate a 7.55% APR - this represents a 1.7% real yield when adjusting for the token dilution. Additionally, AVAX carries many of the same risks that are standard throughout much of the public blockchain network industry. Those risks include regulatory uncertainty and lackluster demand for cryptocurrencies and digital assets over the last year. However, Avalanche appears to be bucking that demand trend more recently. Summary In my January AVAX article, I concluded Avalanche was interesting but that it would take real network growth to change my view that the native coin of the chain is a hold: Though I do not currently have any exposure to AVAX, it is a token that I've previously owned a very small portion of and I would entertain going long AVAX again at some point in the future if the network activity warranted such a move. Shortly after that article, Avalanche's core developer announced a partnership with Amazon ( AMZN ). 5 months later, we are seeing the network activity story changing. Transactions on Avalanche's C-Chain are now at levels that haven't been achieved in over a year. More importantly, though, the last time Avalanche had network activity of this magnitude, the price of AVAX was closer to $80 per coin. Even when adjusting for the 32% supply dilution over the last 18 months, I think AVAX has some catching up to from a price per coin standpoint.",POSITIVE,AVAX | ETH | ARB,AVAX | ETH | ICO | TRADING | ARB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4609160-avalanche-fundamental-divergence-from-price?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13110306.jpeg

According to the Blockchain intelligence company Arkham Intel, In the past 24 hours alone, Celsius has staked over $600 million worth of ETH, with no signs of slowing down. This represents a massive on-chain flow, and the rate of deposits continues to increase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Becoming Greener At An Unexpected Pace, Good For BTC Price? Celsius Goes All-In On ETH Celsiu’s address was the largest withdrawer when Lido (LDO) opened withdrawals in mid-May, withdrawing over 400,000 ETH, worth $800 million. They held this ETH in the ‘Unstaking’ wallet for two weeks, declaring their intent to stake with institutional provider Figment instead. Around 24 hours ago, Celsius separated the ETH from the unstaking wallet into two separate deposit wallets. One wallet is marked Celsius’s ETH2 Deposit wallet, while the other wallet is labelled “Staked ETH” and deposits to Figment. Celsius’s staking wallet has seen over $400 million worth of ETH inflows over the past 24 hours, with continual deposits made every few minutes. Figment is a staking and infrastructure provider for blockchain networks, including Ethereum. The company provides institutional-grade staking infrastructure and tools for investors and companies looking to participate in the proof-of-stake (PoS) networks. Furthermore, the infrastructure provider offers a range of staking services, including delegated staking, which allows investors to delegate their tokens to a validator node to generate rewards without having to run their own node. The company also provides a range of developer tools, APIs, and analytics to help users better understand and manage their staking activities. Morevoer, the wallet provided to Celsius by Figment has seen over $215 million worth of ETH. In total, Celsius has deposited over $600 million worth of ETH, with the Celsius Staking wallet still holding over $150 million worth of ETH, and around $60 million worth of ETH left in the wallet they used to unstake from Lido. This means that Celsius still has a significant amount of ETH that they can potentially stake with another provider or use for other purposes. It also highlights the confidence that Celsius has in the staking services provided by Figment, as they have entrusted them with a large amount of their ETH holdings. Celsius’s move to stake such a large amount of ETH is a testament to the growing trend of staking in the crypto market. With more investors looking for ways to earn passive income on their holdings, staking is becoming an increasingly popular option. As more companies like Celsius enter the market, it can be expected to see even more growth in the staking sector in the coming months and years. Ethereum Market Poised For Major Move On the other hand, crypto analyst Jackis has recently shared insights on the current state of the Ethereum market, stating that there is potential for things to get exciting very soon. Despite the market remaining stagnant over the past few weeks, Jackis believes that Ethereum could be gearing up for a major move. According to Jackis, Ethereum has broken out of its downtrend and has successfully retested the breakout demand. If the cryptocurrency manages to flip the $1,887 resistance level, then there could be nothing stopping it from retesting the yearly range high at $2030. If Ethereum manages to reach and surpass this level, it could potentially continue to climb higher, possibly even reaching new yearly highs later down the line.

42420295,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUevSH,1685738836,Why Did Bitcoin’s Price Rise? BTC Hovers Over $27K as Investors Shrug Off Hot Jobs Data,"Bitcoin rose a little on Friday, but largely shrugged off an unexpectedly strong jobs report, along with a week’s worth of upset and uproar over the U.S. debt ceiling, end-game negotiations and renewed inflation concerns.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $27,180, up 1.2%. BTC edged above $27,000 shortly before U.S. equity markets opened on Friday after spending much of the previous two days well below this threshold, a result largely of the sort of inflationary angst that has hobbled prices over the past 18 months.  “Bitcoin is holding steady after a busy week filled with a debt limit deal, a complicated jobs report that showed both robust hiring and surging layoffs, and as lawmakers inch towards figuring out how to regulate crypto,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email, flagging recent discussion of a Securities Clarity Act that could clarify “if some tokens are unregistered securities.”  Read More: A House Bill Would Make It Harder for the SEC to Argue Crypto Tokens Are Securities  Ether was recently changing hands just over $1,905, up nearly 2% from Thursday, same time. The second largest crypto had spent much of the past seven days below this level as ETH investors also wrestled with macroeconomic headwinds.  Almost without exception, other major cryptos spent the day solidly in positive territory with ADA and SOL, the tokens of the Cardano and Solana smart contract platforms, recently rising more than 4% and 3.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, a bevy of small DeFi focused protocols were the big gainers of the past seven days, according to the CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets overall performance, with Lido (LDO), Synapse (SYN), and PancakeSwap (CAKE), climbing 15%, 13%, and 12%, respectively. The CMI was recently up 1.6%.  Stocks jumped following the robust U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy adding 339,000 jobs in May, about 75% more than economists forecast and also markedly higher than the 294,000 jobs added in April. The hot jobs data offered the latest evidence that the employment market remained tight, a sign that the economy isn’t done expanding and that inflation therefore will remain a concern. Yet a May unemployment rate of 3.7%, higher than the anticipated 3.5%, offered a more hopeful sign that the U.S. central bank may use to justify a halt to its steady diet of interest rate hikes. Rate increases have bedeviled crypto markets.  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, spiked 1.4% and 1%, respectively. Safe-haven gold, which neared a record high less than a month ago, dropped 1.5% to trade at $1,965.  Oanda’s Moya said that the U.S. central banks suggested that the U.S. central bank faces a difficult decision on a June interest rate increase after indicating it was open to a stoppage and might be influenced by the upcoming Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and May Consumer Price Index releases.  “The Fed has almost locked themselves into a corner with a skip for the June meeting, but it should be very clear that they are not done raising rates,” Moya wrote, also noting that “that at the midpoint of the year, “this economy is not showing strong signs that the second half of the year recession is coming.”  Read More: Binance Market Share Drops to Lowest Level Since October",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/02/why-did-bitcoins-price-rise-btc-hovers-over-27k-as-investors-shrug-off-hot-jobs-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/572aa10f00a6586c43b3ec0443f32d7582bd5954-1730x948.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13107484,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536311,1685736059,"Bitcoin Is Becoming Greener At An Unexpected Pace, Good For BTC Price?","Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, is going green, and the pace at which the network has reduced its carbon emissions in the past three years has been noted by climate activists. Nonetheless, how this could impact BTC prices and attract technology firms like Tesla, the electric automobile manufacturer, is yet to be seen. Carbon Emission Associated With Bitcoin Miners Rapidly Falling As of late May, on-chain data from Woonomic shared by Daniel Batten, a climate technology investor, and activist, noted that the amount of Carbon emission associated with Bitcoin mining has fallen by nearly 50% from 601g/kWh to 299g/kWh in three short years. It should be observed that the Bitcoin hash rate and prices have been rising steadily during this time. In the last quarter of 2021, the Bitcoin price soared to as high as $69,000 before collapsing to below $16,000 in November 2022. Although prices have since recovered, soaring to as high as $31,000 in April 2023, the hash rate has been steadily rising over the years. In proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin and Litecoin, the hash rate relays the computing power dedicated to the network in real time. It is a variable that makes the network secure and robust against third-party attacks, and can also be used to gauge the pace at which the Bitcoin platform consumes energy. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Schwartz Reveals Insights Into AMM Trading Strategy Miners channel computing power as “hash rate” to secure the Bitcoin network. They need this to verify transactions in exchange for network rewards. The more the hash rate, the higher the chance of earning a block and, thus, the 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes. However, the tough competition for the block rewards has been partly blamed for environmental degradation and carbon emissions from miners. To stay competitive, Bitcoin miners have to operate gear that is energy-intensive. Critics have always maintained that electricity powering them is from coal and other non-renewable sources. As of June 2, the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index shows that 105.23 TWh powers Bitcoin. It is the same amount of electricity consumed by Kazakhstan. The resulting Carbon emission, they add, stands at 58.69 Mt CO2, comparable to that emitted by Libya. However, data from the Bitcoin Mining Counsel, a group comprised of some of the largest BTC miners in the world, provides more insight into the cryptocurrency’s energy consumption after conducting a study on its members: (…) the members of the BMC (Bitcoin Mining Council) and participants in the survey are currently utilizing electricity with a 63.8% sustainable power mix. Based on this data, the global bitcoin mining industry’s sustainable electricity mix has improved marginally to 58.9% and remains one of the most sustainable industries globally. Will Green Mining Support BTC Prices? In that sense, Woonomic data coincides that emissions have fallen drastically over the last three years. It has nearly halved to 299g/kWh, suggesting miners switched to greener energy sources to power their rigs. Related Reading: Bloomberg’s Senior Macro Strategist Predicts More Pain Ahead For Bitcoin Technology companies would likely consider adopting BTC as payment as carbon emissions fall. Earlier, Tesla reneged on their decision to accept BTC for payment, citing the impact of Bitcoin mining on the environment. With Carbon emissions decreasing, this could positively impact BTC as major entities worldwide will embrace the coin and network.

The OvalPixel AI game token with symbol $OPAIG allows players of all ages and experience levels, from gamers to grandmas, to earn OPAIG utility tokens by correctly answering trivia/quiz questions generated in real time by OvalPixel’s innovative AI system. We live in an age of constant connectivity and information at our fingertips. But one thing has been missing—until now. OPAIG is the first play-to-earn game that harnesses the power of AI, blockchain technology and crypto to revolutionize how people play and interact. Players can then exchange their OPAIG tokens for real money through the Banana Crystal Payments platform or use them in-game to buy exciting 3D NFT trophies from the FlatPyramid 3D Model Marketplace. To enable mainstream audience access, OvalPixel has partnered with Banana Crystal Payments. This allows anyone to play OPAIG and earn tokens which they can simply convert to USDT digital dollars. No complex crypto knowledge is needed. OvalPixel will institute a continuous buyback and burn mechanism to increase the value of OPAIG tokens over time. In addition to buying back and burning OPAIG tokens, OvalPixel will also buy back redeemed tokens and reintroduce them into the rewards pool. Thus, preventing the need to mint additional tokens and inflating the supply, and helping with the preservation of OPAIG’s value. This means that early adopters stand to gain the most as supply decreases and demand rises. The company will also airdrop free OPAIG tokens to early adopters and players. “We believe OPAIG represents the future of gaming, AI and blockchain technology,” said OvalPixel CEO George Egbuonu. “For the first time, we have created a seamless experience that fuses these revolutionary technologies in an accessible way for the masses. Players of all backgrounds can now enjoy the benefits of crypto and be rewarded for expanding their knowledge.” The OPAIG game is available now for play on the OvalPixel website. OvalPixel aims to onboard millions of active players in the first year and demonstrate how blockchain and AI can go mainstream. The revolution starts today at OvalPixel with the fusion of AI, blockchain technology and crypto. Users can play to earn and get paid in crypto. OPAIG token is now trading on the Uniswap Polygon chain (Trading Pair: $OPAIG - $MATIC). Users can take part in the revolution and play to earn real crypto rewards. About OvalPixel OvalPixel provides a Play to Earn Blockchain-Powered AI Trivia & Quiz Game. The AI game generates new trivia multiple choice questions and answers on any topic on-demand so players are always challenged and expanding their knowledge.

This week’s DeFi and overall leader was Injective Protocol (INJ), the layer 1 blockchain geared towards building decentralized finance applications, including exchanges and lending protocols. INJ is also the leader year to date, increasing 527% since January.  DeFi protocols Lido (LDO), Synapse (SYN), and PancakeSwap (CAKE), also had strong weeks, rising 15%, 13%, and 12%, respectively.  ARPA Chain (ARPA), an asset within the Computing sector, was the overall laggard on the week, falling by 40%. The CMI includes 156 assets across six sectors, with each asset being classified on the basis of its intended use or application.  Bitcoin and ether finished 46th and 67th, rising just 1.39% and 3.5%, respectively, in a turbulent week that saw the U.S. Congress pass a bill to raise the debt limit, and renewed worries about inflation and the increasing likelihood of at least one more interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. On Friday, an unexpectedly robust employment market report showing the U.S. economy adding 339,000 jobs in May versus forecasts for 190,000, seemed to bolster the case for a continuation of monetary hawkishness. Tight job markets characteristic of strong economies traditionally rachet up inflationary pressure.  Yet other signals were less definitive as unemployment rose to 3.7%, versus expectations of 3.5%, and the U-6 unemployment rate, often viewed as a more comprehensive measure of labor markets given its inclusion of discouraged and underemployed workers also rose.  As of publication, the Bitcoin Trend Indicator (BTI) is flashing a downtrend signal, a decline from relative to the prior neutral signal. The Ether Trend Indicator (ETI) continues to signal that the asset is in the middle of a “significant uptrend”.  Among the five CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) sectors, DeFi led the way over the most recent seven days, with a 2.57% gain overall. The Digitization sector was the laggard, falling 3.4% over the identical time period.  Year-to-date, the DeFi sector ranks fourth among CMI sectors, with the Currency sector leading the way.

13106178,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536294,1685730646,Bloomberg’s Senior Macro Strategist Predicts More Pain Ahead For Bitcoin,"In his latest report titled “Crypto Outlook, June 2023,” Bloomberg’s Senior Macro Strategist, Mike McGlone, predicts more pain ahead for Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market. McGlone argues that despite a rebound in prices in 2023, the risks for the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index remain tilted downward. Related Reading: No More Crab: Bitcoin Poised For Explosive Move Above $30,000 Is Bitcoin Doomed? According to McGlone, cryptocurrencies face several headwinds, including the potential for a US recession, a potential stock bear market, vigilant central banks, and high interest-rate competition. These factors, combined with the speculative excesses that led to the 2021 peak, suggest that the outlook for the crypto market is bearish. Furthermore, McGlone points out that Bitcoin weakening in May, along with copper and equities in China, is unusual compared to the stalwart Nasdaq 100 Stock Index. While the potential for the Nasdaq to lift all boats exists, it may contrast with still-rising Fed rate-hike expectations. Additionally, McGlone suggests that Bitcoin, which is often referred to as digital gold due to its perceived status as a store of value, may not be able to outperform the traditional safe-haven asset in a US economic contraction. This is because Bitcoin is still relatively young compared to gold, which has been used as a store of value for thousands of years. As a result, investors may be more likely to flock to gold during times of economic uncertainty, rather than newer assets like Bitcoin. Moreover, plunging commodities, producer prices, and bank deposits may serve as deflationary omens of the lags to Federal Reserve tightening. These factors suggest that the risks for the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index are tilted downward, and investors should be cautious. As reported by NewsBTC on May 22nd, Mike McGlone highlighted the historical patterns of boom and bust in Bitcoin, which are closely tied to liquidity. According to McGlone, Bitcoin’s current price level of around $27,000 may be at risk of reversion, considering that it was only $7,000 at the end of 2019 before the massive liquidity pump in 2020. McGlone’s analysis also indicates that Bitcoin’s downward trajectory, as demonstrated by its 52-week moving average, contrasts with the upward trend it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. This suggests that the cryptocurrency is susceptible to booms when liquidity is abundant but vulnerable to busts when liquidity is removed. McGlone’s latest analysis aligns with his previous thesis that the outlook for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market is bearish, given the potential for a US recession, a potential stock bear market, vigilant central banks, and high interest-rate competition. Is BTC About To Take Off? On the other hand, Crypto Con, a well-known crypto analyst, has recently expressed his continued bullishness on Bitcoin, citing the Pi Cycle Top indicator as evidence of the cryptocurrency’s potential for a continued uptrend. According to Crypto Con, the Yellow 111days Moving Average (MA) has started to uptick, indicating that Bitcoin is experiencing a positive trend. Additionally, Bitcoin has been retesting the 111DMA line as support, rather than continuing on a parabolic trajectory, which is typically a sign of a market top. Crypto Con acknowledges that sometimes the bounce can take some time, but he maintains that this is nothing but bullish for Bitcoin. This is because the Pi Cycle Top indicator is a reliable tool that has historically predicted major market tops and bottoms in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Schwartz Reveals Insights Into AMM Trading Strategy The Pi Cycle Top indicator measures the relationship between the 111DMA and the 350DMA, and when the two lines cross, it can suggest a potential market top or bottom. The fact that the Yellow 111DMA is showing an uptick suggests that Bitcoin may be headed for a market bottom, which is a bullish sign for investors. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin, is trading at $27,000. Over the past 24 hours, BTC’s price has remained relatively stable, exhibiting sideways price action with a minor increase of 0.1%.

The miner also increased its operational computing power by 9% to 15.2 exahash/second (EH/S), according to the statement.  Thiel attributed the majority of the increase to Marathon's proprietary software in an interview with CoinDesk TV on Friday. The software gives Marathon the ""ability to control the output of the machines, the uptime of the machines, scaling up and down the hash rate of the machines,"" he said.  Marathon operates its own mining pool, ""which means that there can be fluctuations in bitcoin production to the expected value,"" said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies.  In early May, miners saw an uptick in revenues thanks to higher transaction fees due to popularity of Ordinals. The protocol enabled added functionality on the bitcoin blockchain, such as non-fungible tokens and memecoins, driving up demand for block space. As a result, fees miners rake in for processing transactions surpassed block rewards in early May.  ""Ordinals significantly helped large scale miners like Marathon,"" said Vera.  Read more: Bitcoin’s High Fees Brought Back Bull Market-Level Mining Revenue, But Not for Long  The 77% increase in Marathon's May bitcoin production could likely be attributable to the fact that it wasn't running its machines at full capacity during April, such that it potentially had a lot of room to increase its production in the following month.  In fact, the miner said in April that its monthly 15% decrease in bitcoin production was due to increased difficulty on the network, luck and ""to a lesser extent, curtailment activity.""  Marathon in the previous month produced markedly little bitcoin per exahash, which can be partly attributedto downtime of its mining machines. In April, Marathon mined 50 bitcoin per exahash of computing power, the least out of 14 publicly listed miners. In comparison, during April, peer CleanSpark (CLSK) mined 78 bitcoin, Riot Platforms (RIOT) had 61 and Hive Blockchain (HIVE) produced 81 bitcoin per exahash.

42420293,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUevPB,1685729484,Blockchain Association Files Amicus Brief in Coin Center Lawsuit Against U.S. Treasury Over Tornado Cash Sanctions,"The Blockchain Association has filed an amicus brief in an ongoing lawsuit by think tank Coin Center against the Treasury Department and its sanctions watchdog, the Office of Foreign Asset Control.  In the suit, filed last October, Coin Center has alleged that the U.S. Treasury Department’s sweeping sanctions against crypto mixer Tornado Cash harmed Americans and their ability to transact privately using the Ethereum network.  ""It's critical to recognize that Tornado Cash is simply a tool – punishing the tool itself simply because it can be used by anyone, including bad actors, runs contrary to the values this country was founded upon,” Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith said in a statement. “Blockchain Association stands with Coin Center, advocating for the responsible and lawful use of blockchain technology. Regulatory actions should only be targeted at bad actors who abuse this tool for illegal purposes.""  The suit was the second that the advocacy group filed against the Treasury Department, and the second lawsuit against Treasury over its Tornado Cash sanctions.  OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash last August, saying that North Korean hackers had laundered hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of crypto through the mixer since its launch. Approximately 20% of Tornado Cash’s overall transaction volume was tied to one hack or another, the federal government alleged.  The crypto industry has vigorously opposed the move, highlighting that OFAC does not normally sanction software and that Tornado Cash does not have a central operator.  There are legitimate uses for individuals to use privacy-enhancing tools like Tornado Cash, the suit claimed, and OFAC’s sanctions against the privacy mixer – which works by pooling funds to obfuscate the sender of any given transaction – mean that these individuals now effectively expose their entire transaction history to anyone looking at the network data.  “An order effectively requiring Defendants to decriminalize use of the 20 Tornado Cash addresses would allow Plaintiffs to conduct their legitimate activities with some measure of anonymity, use their preferred software tool without fear of penalties, and engage in important expressive associations,” the suit said. “Judicial relief would also serve the public interest by averting harm to Tornado Cash users who are United States persons, to Ethereum as a freedom and privacy enhancing technology, and to the important sector of the economy that depends on Ethereum.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/02/blockchain-association-files-amicus-brief-in-coin-center-lawsuit-against-us-treasury-over-tornado-cash-sanctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f17a4bf0b48aa60848b5b2d8188d004ba2304fb-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420299,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUevYT,1685727077,"Bridge Exploits Cost $2B in 2022, Here’s How They Could Have Been Averted","In the evolution towards a full multi-chain future, bridges remain more vulnerable to hacks than cryptocurrency networks themselves. In 2022 alone, over $2 billion in assets was stolen from token bridge exploits. The worst part is that they could have all been avoided by employing multiple security measures.  Through examining some of 2022’s attacks, we can better understand some of the major flaws in the system and the individual security measures that exist or are being developed to protect against them.  Social engineering  Social engineering attacks are the most common form of security breaches. Everyone has been subject to a social engineering attack at some point in their lives – either through phishing or honey traps, where “too-good-to-be-true offers” are promised in exchange for personal information.  Martin Köppelmann is co-founder of Gnosis.  Hackers in the biggest bridge exploit of 2022 relied on similar methods to siphon funds. The blockchain of the high-profile crypto game Axie Infinity was hacked with a phishing scheme that involved fake LinkedIn job offers.  The game’s developer, Sky Mavis, said its employees were targeted with fake job offers and even asked to appear for multiple rounds of job interviews. When the employees took the bait, hackers accessed their systems and made off with $625 million from the Sky Mavis’ Ronin Network. During a postmortem analysis of what went wrong, Sky Mavis said it had been the victim of advanced spear-phishing attacks.  Compromised private keys  In September 2022, Wintermute, an algorithmic market maker, was hacked for $160 million, likely due to a weakness in private keys generated by the Profanity app.  The hot wallet’s private key was exploited and used to drain the funds. Reports said flaws were previously detected in Profanity’s addresses, but the company didn’t take these reports seriously.  A similar reason was reported behind the hack of Slope, resulting in a loss of $6 million for the company.  Smart contract bugs  Smart contracts are programs stored in a blockchain set to trigger when certain predetermined conditions are met. In terms of e-commerce, for instance, it’s what confirms to a website that an item should be delivered once you’ve added it to your basket and paid for it. A bug in a smart contract can thus allow hackers to illegitimately trigger the transfer of money between blockchains without fulfilling any conditions.  In the case of Nomad, hackers were able to drain nearly $200 million from the bridge by discovering a misconfiguration in the primary smart contract which allowed anyone with a basic understanding of the code to withdraw funds.  That these bugs and security flaws were so blatantly exploited by hackers is a worrying thought, yet what’s more troubling still is that the ‘trusted’ systems that people didn't think about using were so easily exploitable.  The solution: multiple security measures  Bridge standards are sets of rules that define how different blockchain networks can communicate with each other, in this case, through a cross-chain bridge. While some of these protocols, by themselves, are at risk of exploitation, when put together they add much-needed additional layers of security.  By using multiple bridge standards at the same time, developers can offset weaknesses displayed in one protocol with the use of another protocol. Let’s look at some cryptographic standards that could be used in combination to add additional layers of security.  Multi-sig and committee  Multi-sig technology requires the signature or approval of multiple parties before a transaction can be executed. It can prevent unauthorized access to networks and ensure that no single party has complete control.  A committee bridge standard uses a group of trusted entities, or a committee, to manage the security of a network bridge. Members are responsible for approving and overseeing network transactions. Committees are beneficial when multiple organizations share access to a network.  Zero Knowledge  Zero Knowledge (ZK) is a cryptographic technique that allows two parties to exchange information with each other without the need to reveal any additional information beyond what is absolutely required.  The integration of ZK models eliminates the need for the committee model by allowing developers to utilize light clients on-chain. By using Zero Knowledge Proof systems and specifically the “Succinctness” property of a ZK-SNARK, it is possible to efficiently perform this verification process using on-chain light clients. It is also possible to verify both state transitions and consensus on-chain for maximum security, similar to running a full node.  To do this, the on-chain light client uses ZKP systems to prove that the state of the source chain is valid. This is done by generating a proof that can be verified by the target chain without needing to know the entire state of the source chain. The use of on-chain light clients can help to improve the security and scalability of blockchains. By verifying the state of the source chain on the target chain, the target chain can be more confident that the state of the source chain is accurate. This can help to prevent fraud and other malicious activities while still working to scale the network. As a practical example, ZK can be used to prove that a transaction has been authorized by the owner of a particular wallet without revealing the private key.  Optimistic  Some bridges use an ‘optimistic’ approach to transaction verification wherein rather than immediately verifying each transaction on the target blockchain, optimistic bridges assume that each transaction is valid and then incentivize additional participants to point out fraudulent transactions for a reward. The funds are only cleared after this challenge period has lapsed. This means that optimistic bridges are game-theoretically secure, but not mathematically secure -- they rely on third parties to pay attention to what is happening. All of this is often abstracted away from the user through additional liquidity providers who independently check the veracity of the bridge claims and make the funds immediately available on the other chain against a fee of a few basis points.  Optimistic bridges can still be quite secure even though they do not immediately verify each transaction. This is because they use the ""challenge and dispute"" method; if a user believes that a transaction has been processed incorrectly, they can challenge the transaction and the bridge will investigate.  Challenges of implementing multiple bridge standards  When all is said and done, the best security is achieved by using a combination of standards. This way, if one bridge implementation experiences a bug or a security weakness, the other standards can still protect the network.  It should be noted that of course bridges still rely on the consensus mechanisms of the connecting networks. A bridge can never be more secure than the networks it connects.  Securely accessing a multi-chain world  Bridges are necessary to provide unfettered access to our multi-chain world, but we have to fortify these bridges in inventive ways to reduce points of attack. Blockchain technology is custom-built to allow strangers to come together and make direct, immutable decisions and the more we focus on utilizing the entire scope of the networks at our disposal the stronger our bridges will become.",NEGATIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ZK,Martin Köppelmann,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/06/02/bridge-exploits-cost-2b-in-2022-heres-how-they-could-have-been-averted,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f73af07a9ec1733da4fb6b8b6e237af4e0f75f45-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These Bitcoin Pricing Models Are Currently Near The Spot Price In a new tweet, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out how the three pricing models, the adjusted realized price, the short-term holder cost basis, and the 200-week MA, are all close to the asset’s value right now. To understand the first and second models here, the “realized price” needs to be looked at first. The realized price is a pricing model derived from the realized cap, which is a capitalization model that assumes that the “real” value of each coin in the circulating supply is not the spot price, but the price at which it was last moved. When this cap is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, the average cost basis or acquisition price in the market is obtained. This value, which the average holder on the network bought their coins at, is known as the realized price. Now, the first pricing model, the “adjusted realized price,” is a modification of this indicator that drops from the data all holders who haven’t moved their coins since more than seven years ago. Related Reading: Why This Is The Most Important Bitcoin Chart You’ll See This Week Such old supply usually consists mostly of the coins that have been lost (perhaps due to the wallet keys no longer being accessible), which means that this part of the supply wouldn’t be relevant to the current market, hence why the indicator cuts it out. As for the second model of interest here, the “short-term holder (STH) cost basis,” this metric keeps track of the realized price of specifically the investors who have been holding their coins since less than 155 days. Here is a chart that shows how these Bitcoin pricing models have compared with the spot price during the past year: The price seems to be just above these models at the moment | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin adjusted realized price currently has a value of $25,300, while the short-term holder cost basis has a value of $26,000. Historically, these models have acted as both resistance and support for the price, depending on the wider trend. In bullish periods, they usually act as support so it’s possible that if the price drops deep enough to hit them, a rebound may happen. The third line on the chart, the 200-week moving average (MA), is a model that aims to find the baseline momentum of the four year Bitcoin cycle. This line has also had some similar interactions with the price as the other two models. The 200-week MA has a value of $26,300 right now, implying that it’s currently the closest line to the spot price. It now remains to be seen how the price interacts with these lines, starting with the 200-week MA, if a drawdown extended enough happens.

42420294,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUevTJ,1685725344,What AI Governance Can Learn From Crypto’s Decentralization Ethos,"The titans of U.S. tech have rapidly gone from being labeled by their critics as self-serving techno-utopianists to being the most vocal propagators of a techno-dystopian narrative.  This week, a letter signed by the more than 350 people, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former Google scientist Geoffrey Hinton (sometimes called the “Godfather of AI”) delivered a single, declarative sentence: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.”  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Just two months ago, an earlier open letter signed by Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk along with 31,800 others, called for a six-month pause in AI development to allow society to determine its risks to humanity. In an op-ed for TIME that same week, Eliezer Yudkowsky, considered the founder of the field artificial general intelligence (AGI), said he refused to sign that letter because it didn’t go far enough. Instead, he called for a militarily-enforced shutdown of AI development labs lest a sentient digital being arises that kills everyone of us.  World leaders will find it hard to ignore the concerns of these highly recognized experts. It is now widely understood that a threat to human existence actually exists. The question is: how, exactly, should we mitigate it?  As I’ve written previously, I see a role for the crypto industry, working with other technological solutions and in concert with thoughtful regulation that encourages innovative, human-centric innovation, in society’s efforts to keep AI in its lane. Blockchains can help with the provenance of data inputs, with proofs to prevent deep fakes and other forms of disinformation, and to enable collective, rather than corporate ownership. But even setting aside those considerations, I think the most valuable contribution from the crypto community lies in its “decentralization mindset,” which offers a unique perspective on the dangers posed by concentrated ownership of such a powerful technology.  A Byzantine view of AI risks  First, what do I mean by this “decentralization mindset?”  Well, at its core, crypto is steeped in a “don’t trust, verify” ethos. Diehard crypto developers – rather than the money-grabbers whose centralized token casinos put the industry into disrepute – relentlessly engage in “Alice and Bob” thought-experiments to consider all threat vectors and points of failure by which a rogue actor might intentionally or unintentionally be enabled to do harm. Bitcoin itself was born of Satoshi trying to solve one of the most famous of these game theory scenarios, the Byzantine Generals Problem, which is all about how to trust information from someone you don’t know.  The mindset treats decentralization as the way to address those risks. The idea is that if there is no single, centralized entity with middleman powers to determine the outcome of an exchange between two actors, and both can trust the information available about that exchange, then the threat of malicious intervention is neutralized.  Now, let’s apply this worldview to the demands laid out in this week’s AI “extinction” letter.  Read more: Allison Duettmann - How Crypto Can Help Secure AI  The signatories want governments to come together and devise international-level policies to contend with the AI threat. That’s a noble goal, but the decentralization mindset would say it’s naive. How can we assume that all governments, present and future, will recognize that their interests are served by cooperating rather than going it alone – or worse, that they won’t say one thing but do another? (If you think monitoring North Korea’s nuclear weapons program is hard, try getting behind a Kremlin-funded encryption wall to peer into its machine learning experiments.)  It was one thing to expect global coordination around the COVID pandemic, when every country had a need for vaccines, or to expect that the logic of mutually assured destruction (MAD) would lead even the bitterest enemies in the Cold War to agree not to bring even nuclear weapons, where the worst-case scenario is so obvious to everyone. It’s another for it to happen around something as unpredictable as the direction of AI – and, just as importantly, where non-government actors can easily use the technology independently of governments.  The concern that some in the crypto community have about these big AI players rushing to regulate is that they will create a moat to protect their first-mover advantage, making it harder for competitors to go after them. Why does that matter? Because in endorsing a monopoly, you create the very centralized risk that these decades-old crypto thought-experiments tell us to avoid.  I never gave Google’s “Do No Evil” motto much credence, but even if Alphabet, Microsoft, OpenAI and co. are well intentioned, how do I know their technology won’t be co-opted by a differently-motivated executive board, government, or a hacker in the future? Or, in a more innocent sense, if that technology exists inside an impenetrable corporate black box, how can outsiders check the algorithm’s code to ensure that well-intentioned development is not inadvertently going off the rails?  And here’s another thought experiment to examine the risk of centralization for AI:  If, as people like Yudkowsky believe, AI is destined under its current trajectory to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) status, with an intelligence that could lead it to conclude that it should kill us all, what structural scenario will lead it to draw that conclusion? If the data and processing capacity that keeps AI “alive” is concentrated in a single entity that can be shut down by a government or a worried CEO, one could logically argue that the AI would then kill us to prevent that possibility. But if AI itself “lives” within a decentralized, censorship-resistant network of nodes that cannot be shut down, this digital sentient won’t feel sufficiently threatened to eradicate us.  I have no idea, of course, whether that’s how things would play out. But in the absence of a crystal ball, the logic of Yudowskly’s AGI thesis demands that we engage in these thought-experiments to consider how this potential future nemesis might “think.”  Finding the right mix  Of course, most governments will struggle to buy any of this. They will naturally prefer the “please regulate us” message that OpenAI’s Altman and others are actively delivering right now. Governments want control; they want the capacity to subpoena CEOs and order shutdowns. It’s in their DNA.  And, to be clear, we need to be realistic. We live in a world organized around nation-states. Like it or not, it’s the jurisdictional system we’re stuck with. We have no choice but to involve some level of regulation in the AI extinction-mitigation strategy.  The challenge is to figure out the right, complementary mix of national government regulation, international treaties and decentralized, transnational governance models.  There are, perhaps, lessons to take from the approach that governments, academic institutions, private companies and non-profit organizations took to regulating the internet. Through bodies such the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names (ICANN) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), we installed multistakeholder frameworks to enable the development of common standards and to allow for dispute resolution through arbitration rather than the courts.  Some level of AI regulation will, undoubtedly, be necessary, but there’s no way that this borderless, open, rapidly changing technology can be controlled entirely by governments. Let’s hope they can put aside the current animus toward the crypto industry and seek out its advice on resolving these challenges with decentralized approaches.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

42420298,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUevWP,1685724053,Apple and Goldman Sachs Don’t Trust Their New Banking Customers,"Users of Apple’s new Apple Savings service, launched in April in partnership with Goldman Sachs, are reporting severe delays in withdrawing or moving their deposits. Customers have struggled for weeks to retrieve amounts as high as $100,000 stranded in Apple Savings accounts, according to the Wall Street Journal.  The explanation for the delays is reasonable – at least, by the bizarre standards of the traditional finance system. In many cases the frozen funds were under “security review” – that is, Goldman is making sure its depositors aren’t engaged in criminal money laundering.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The absurdity of this is layered and nuanced, like a souffle of clumsy, anti-customer banking practices. One trigger for such a bank security review, you see, is making a large deposit into a new account. But Apple has been heavily marketing the above-average interest rate on its savings service (4.15%), so it shouldn’t be a surprise people are depositing large amounts – which is also kind of what normal people do with a savings account already? And the savings service was only launched a few weeks ago, so all of the accounts are new.  In other words, if you followed Apple’s marketing cues and opened a big new savings account managed by Goldman, the default assumption baked into the system appears to be that you are a money launderer whose funds must be frozen immediately and indefinitely.  This becomes even more of a dystopian nightmare when you look at the specific people targeted by Goldman’s hamfisted anti-money laundering effort.  One victim who spoke to the Journal was Antonio Sanchez, a Grammy-winning musician who has collaborated with Dave Matthews and Trent Reznor. This is a person who a quick Google search and phone call could easily have determined is unlikely to be a money launderer. But instead Sanchez, like the other customers profiled, wound up fighting through a Kafkaesque customer service maze for weeks, trying to pry loose a frozen $100,000 intended for a down payment on a house. Sanchez wound up having to borrow money from his mother-in-law: truly, a nightmare beyond nightmares.  And if you’re not a Grammy winner? Well, that’s certainly not going to improve how you’re treated. The one solution that worked for a few of the profiled customers was ... getting the Wall Street Journal to call Goldman about their issues. That customer service solution is not available to most of us.  Goldman Sachs is not a retail-focused bank, and has struggled acutely with its efforts to serve smaller customers. But the incident also tracks a larger shift in traditional banking away from any kind of meaningful customer service, towards an increasingly automated, disinterested and even hostile approach to its piddling retail depositors.  See also: Fractional Reserve Banking Is a Fraud (but It's Genius) | Opinion  What makes this anti-customer bias truly toxic, though, is that it’s combined with an utterly opaque anti-money laundering regime that seems to have uncontested effective control over every bank deposit in the United States. Make one wrong move – something that looks even vaguely suspicious to a mute algorithm or an underpaid data analyst – and suddenly your property is “under review,” until they say otherwise.  That suspicious activity apparently now includes “opening a bank account” and “depositing money in it.”  So ask yourself this. When your bank doesn’t care who you are, and has the power to freeze your funds any time, without explanation, for an indefinite period … is that money really yours at all?",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT,David Z.

Related Reading: Litecoin Breaks $95 As Whale Transactions Spike Schwartz states that AMMs thrive when an asset is volatile but does not change its price direction much. Schwartz explained further that an asset whose volatility exceeds its long-term trend would have a positive average percentage movement. However, if the long-term trend is negative, it will reduce the average slightly and vice-versa. It’s Not Difficult to Create A Trading Strategy, Ripple CTO According to the Ripple CTO, it is not difficult to create a trading strategy to track the average percentage movement of an asset. He further explained that the trading strategy of an AMM is advanced compared to a simple trading strategy and focuses on price volatility. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz Says This Will Kickstart The Bitcoin Bull Market Schwartz, however, added a disclaimer at the end of his analysis. He stated that the AMM trading strategy only works for an AMM between an asset with a fixed price and one whose price is volatile enough to overcome its long-term trend. Also, he believes that although AMM works even when the assets don’t meet the stated conditions, their behavior is different. From his analysis, a notable deviation will only occur with a long-term negative price movement that exceeds the volatility. Crypto Enthusiast Reacts To Analysis Reacting to Schwartz’s AMM analysis, Molly Elmore asked if XRP would be the asset with a fixed price paired with every other asset on the XRP ledger (XRPL). In response, Schwartz stated that the AMM is not exclusive to XRP and can function between any asset pair. However, the trading strategies will differ mathematically if both assets are volatile. Citing the BTC/XRP pair as a reference, Schwartz stated that although both assets are volatile, the pairing is still great. Additionally, he stated that if you are bullish on XRP and BTC, investing in an XRP/USD AMM implies holding much USD that can go up. Notably, holding shares of an XRP/BTC AMM captures more of the upward price movement of XRP and BTC if the bullish sentiment is correct. Schwartz continued his analysis, stating that if XRP and BTC’s price doubles, an XRP/USD AMM has a worst-case (no volatility and no market making) yield of around 40%. In comparison, an XRP/BTC AMM has a worst-case yield of 100%. On the flip side, Schwartz noted that the outcome is worse if your bullish sentiment is wrong. If both XRP and BTC reduce by 50%, the worst case loss is 50%, while for an XRP/USD AMM, the worst case loss is about 30%. So he believes XRP USD is safer while XRP/BTC is volatile. Schwartz noted that his analysis seemed complex and explained further in a tweet. He stated that AMMs charges trading fees, and volatility causes people to trade with AMMs. Therefore, AMMs turn volatility into fees.

Sparklo is an innovative blockchain-based investment platform that allows users to invest in profitable solid treasures like Gold, Silver and Platinum. Investors can also passively trade these assets using fractionalized NFTs as digital placeholders. It is safe to say that the Sparklo token (SPRK) is one of the hottest tokens in the crypto market at the moment. Crypto experts have already projected a 1,000% rise in price value for the token before the end of Q4 of 2023. Currently, the SPRK token goes at the price of only $0.030 per token. Investors that purchase the SPRK token now will be given a 100% bonus for their purchase which will end in the next 48 hours. This means you have limited time to benefit from this bonus. Experienced investors will recognize that now is the best time to invest in the SPRK tokens for significant gains in the near future. The safety and security of the Sparklo project have been vetted and approved through the Interfi Network. Moreso, BlockAudit Report Team has verified the project's KYC certification. The SPRK token will be locked for 100 years to avoid an event of a rug pull. Do not hesitate to invest in the Sparklo project, as we believe in the promising potential of the token.

Within the last 24 hours, Near Protocol (NEAR) saw an insignificant -0.18% loss in price value. This development pegs the price of the Near Protocol (NEAR) token at $1.56 at the time of writing. The trading volume of Near Protocol (NEAR) went down by -20.31% and currently stands at $40,745,164. In the last few days, the Near Protocol (NEAR) price has not seen any upward price movement. The Near Protocol (NEAR) price chart shows that the coin is struggling to overcome the bear market. Despite all these, crypto experts still think that the price of Near Protocol (NEAR) will surge in the coming days despite the current price trajectory and the stats suggesting the contrary. Near Protocol (NEAR) coin holders have already joined the ongoing Sparklo project, which has proven to be a more viable investment option. XRP (XRP) declines in price value amid fresh token released from escrow XRP (XRP) is a decentralized open-source ledger that executes transactions in the blockchain network at a low-cost price alongside speed and scalability. In a fresh development, XRP (XRP) now has an additional 1 billion tokens added to its circulating supply in another monthly token released by the network. This development was executed through the escrow system which has 55 billion XRP (XRP) tokens locked in from December 17, 2021. These tokens have since then been released at 1 billion per month. However, the escrow system has seen divided opinions among experts as to whether it affects the price of the XRP (XRP) token negatively. XRP (XRP) in the last 24 hours lost 1.08% in price value. As a result, the price of XRP (XRP) is $0.50 at present time. The coin has made significant progress in the last few days and has gained over 5%. However, with the last 24 hours' price of XRP (XRP) not showing signs of a rally, the XRP (XRP) investors have moved over to the trending Sparklo project, where significant gains will be made. The Sparklo project is already giving a bonus for token purchase, which makes it one of the best crypto projects for now.

In a statement published on Twitter on Friday, the central bank said it received more than 100 comments on a consultation it started in February. Respondents came from nine countries and included representatives from commercial banks and institutions.  Respondents highlighted benefits of a CBDC such as increased efficiency, and also risks including high implementation costs and financial exclusion, it said.  The central bank said countries that had issued a CBDC, which is a digital token issued by a central bank, have faced issues ""that have hampered implementation"" and that the recent instability in the crypto market has amplified concerns. Nigeria, for example, has faced issues with adoption while the Bahamas central bank said in May it was working on a strategy to improve CBDC adoption, three years after its launch.  Billions were wiped out of the crypto market last year during the so-called crypto winter and the market turbulence was exacerbated by the collapse of stablecoin issuer Terra and crypto exchange FTX.

One of the latest hybrid exchange platforms, Tradecurve, also made waves in the blockchain community as its utility token, TCRV, spiked by 25%. We will go over the performance of each cryptocurrency to see how far they can climb in value by the end of 2023. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW The Future Potential of the XRP Cryptocurrency While a vast majority of the cryptocurrency market saw a slowed down post-Memorial Day weekend, XRP has carried on towards a bullish direction, as its network has been recording massive spikes in address activity. The XRP network reached its second and third-largest spike in history during the past week, indicating that a major bullish rally can occur in the future, especially for the price of the XRP token, based on information shared by the blockchain analytics firm known as Santiment. On May 27, 490,000 addresses interacted with the network, followed by another spike on May 28. As of May 30, 2023, the XRP cryptocurrency trades at $0.501280. During the past two weeks, its value spiked by 18.8%. In the last 24 hours alone, XRP has been up 4.2%. Based on analysts, the price of the XRP cryptocurrency can surge to its maximum point of $0.98 by the end of the year. How Solana Might Increase in Value Moving Forward Solana, the Layer-1 blockchain that originally launched in 2020, has seen some exciting news, as Raj Gokal, a co-founder of the network, told TechCrunch that ""Solana has the potential to be the Apple of crypto."" Apple has focused on user experience and performance, and as a result, Gokal said, ""It all started with one relentless focus on a simple interaction that had to work perfectly."" The focus on Solana's core engineering and ecosystem is to create a network that feels like the regular internet, even though it is an entirely new financial internet. Solana might also try to compete with Apple by launching its own Android smartphone known as Saga. As for the value of the Solana cryptocurrency, as of May 30, 2023, SOL trades at $21.27. In the last seven days, Solana increased in value by 7.2%, and in the last 24 hours alone, the cryptocurrency saw an increase in its value by 2.7%. Why Tradecurve and Its Utility Token TCRV Has Appealed to Investors Tradecurve is defined as a hybrid trading platform that completely avoids the need for KYC and lengthy registration procedures and instead lets users just deposit crypto and use it as collateral when trading. This provides them with a complete level of anonymity, and better yet, the application allows trading not just crypto, but many other financial products, from CFDs to forex, indices, commodities, options, ETFs, and bonds. Moreover, the team will also implement Proof of Reserves (PoR) and will launch a dedicated trading academy. Tradecurve features high leverage starting at 500:1, a VIP account service, negative balance protection, and algorithmic trading with AI. As of May 30, 2023, the TCRV utility token is at Stage 3 of its presale, where it is offered at $0.015. Its next price target is $0.018, a value it will reach at the start of the Stage 4 presale. This indicates that the cryptocurrency can increase by 20% initially, but analysts are bullish about its future and think it can climb 100x at launch, as 10,112,808 tokens have already been sold, indicating a high demand for the altcoin.

In this context, volatility is reaching a record low, but the status quo could suddenly shift in the short term. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz Says This Will Kickstart The Bitcoin Bull Market As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $27,100 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous week, BTC recorded a 3% increase, while other assets in the top 10 by market capitalization show similar performance, with XRP and MATIC leading the small uptick. The New And Old Status Quo, Bitcoin’s Path Towards New Highs Per a recent report from the trading desk of QCP Capital, the macroeconomic landscape has become clear as political actors in the U.S. reached a compromise on the Debt ceiling. The narrative around this event was triggering uncertainty in the financial sector. Increased uncertainty contributed to the decline in volatility and the sideways movement across risk-on assets, including Bitcoin. In that sense, QCP Capital claims that BTC is following a trajectory similar to 2020 when uncertainty in the macro scene and the crypto market emerged from a long winter. At that time, the cryptocurrency declined to a critical level and displayed sideways movement throughout the year. As seen in the chart below, Bitcoin has not only behaved as it did in 2020 but trended upwards later that year. QCP Capital expects BTC to perform following this fractal, with a break in the sideways price action coming soon. The trading desk noted: This consolidation has played out perfectly so far, but we expect that we are soon coming close to the end sometime this month. As a result, we recommend positioning for an upcoming big move through long 3m and 6m strangles here, with a bias to the long call side. BTC To Vibe With The Season The decline in volatility has led to a decrease in the price of BTC options. Therefore, QCP Capital believes building a BTC position with a long bias using these financial products could be fruitful. As seen in the chart below, volatility for the 3 months at the money (ATM) options are moving with historical data. Before the summer and until late June, volatility trends lower before recording an explosive move.

13103359,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536213,1685719240,How to Invest in Cryptocurrency for Beginners,"What is cryptocurrency investment? Cryptocurrency investment in its most basic form is the process of buying digital currencies and holding them in the hope that the market falls in your favour while your portfolio increases in value. The value of a cryptocurrency is determined by the principle of supply and demand. As demand for a cryptocurrency, coin or token rises, there becomes fewer of them in circulation — resulting in a boom in price action. If the supply of coins outpaces demand for them, their value typically falls. There are several indicators that might draw an investor towards a particular cryptocurrency. Some investors and traders choose which cryptocurrencies to invest in by conducting a technical analysis of a range of coins. An investor might have certain criteria that need to be met to invest. For example, cryptocurrencies that are in an overall uptrend, are showing positive signs of adoption and have a durable, scalable blockchain interface are more desirable than those that don’t. Common types of crypto investing There are many ways to invest in cryptocurrency, besides directly purchasing coins or tokens through an exchange. Some of the common types of crypto investing include: Investing in crypto-oriented or pro-crypto companies ­— As the prices of cryptocurrencies soar, so does the stock price in companies that form their business around them. Companies that are able to integrate cryptocurrency blockchain networks into their service offering can prove profitable as cryptocurrency use becomes more widespread. Investing in crypto-heavy funds — Crypto funds typically carry less risks than committing capital to one specific cryptocurrency. As some cryptocurrencies bull and others bear (decrease or increase), fund holders can still benefit from having their losses hedged by their gains — making them attractive to more risk-averse investors. Buy crypto EFTs on a brokerage platform — Similar to crypto funds, EFTs can also be a great way diversify a portfolio without committing large amounts of capital. The price of an EFT is determined by the price action of a group of coins or tokens rather than just one — making it a safer option for novice investors. Incorporate cryptocurrency into your Roth IRA or 401K — More and more brokerages and investing platforms are allowing cryptocurrency allocations to be held in an IRA or 401K account. For example, Fidelity is unveiling plans to allow users to dedicate 20% of their 401k holding to cryptocurrencies — allowing investors to diversify their 401k. What do I need to know before investing in cryptocurrency? Before plunging into the world of cryptocurrencies, there are a few things to consider: Cryptocurrencies are unregulated and decentralized — Despite being one of the allures that draw investors towards cryptocurrencies, their decentralization can make them potentially dangerous. The threat of scams and fraud can make it a risky asset to hold. They’re known for huge fluctuations in price action — Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other altcoins are extremely volatile. Because their price is determined largely by hype and speculation from coin makers and blockchain developers, it’s difficult for investors to gauge the long-term profitability of cryptocurrency investments. Exercise caution when dealing with ICOs — Similarly to how companies have an initial public offering (IPO) for their stock price when they first go public, emerging cryptocurrencies start out the same way — offering what’s known as an initial coin offering (ICO). Investors must be wary of these as they’re known for their limited transparency when it comes to development progress, user adoption and potential issues, so investors may risk buying into pump and dump schemes. Only invest amounts you’re comfortable losing — Because of their inherent volatility — and lack of data to support consistent long-term growth potential — it’s important investors only invest small portions of their portfolio into cryptocurrency when starting out. Protect your private key — If you’re using a cold or hot wallet to store your cryptocurrency, you’ll need a private key – an alphanumeric code that acts as a password. Protecting this key is paramount to guarding your investments as criminals can steal it and walk away with your assets. Choose the best coin exchange, broker or wallet to suit you — Whether you’re a long-term or short-term investor — or even a day-trader – selecting a broker or exchange that works best for your needs is essential. Investors must consider the features of the site — like what currencies are available, what you can buy and sell and leverage options — as well as transactional costs that are more suited to their investment style. What do I need to invest in cryptocurrency? Investing in crypto is simple and easy to do. All you need is some liquid capital — in the form of a fiat currency like dollars or pound sterling — and an account with a broker or crypto exchange. To get started, you need to: Choose a broker or exchange that best suits you — this might mean selecting one with an easy-to-use interface if you’re just starting out. Create your account, verify your details and link it to your bank account. Deposit the amount of fiat currency you’re willing to invest/risk. After having assessed the market for a cryptocurrency that has taken your interest, place an order to purchases some, select the amount you’d like to invest and confirm the order. Store your cryptocurrency — you can do so in: Hot wallets — Usually on portable devices like laptops and phones, hot wallets are constantly connected to the internet. Although they boast the convenience of always being connected, they’re an easier target for hackers. Cold wallets — These wallets are disconnected storage units that hold your cryptocurrency once it’s been procured. Because they’re disconnected, they’re only at risk when they connect, giving hackers a limited window of opportunity. The brokerage account — If you don’t mind keeping portfolios separate, you can just store your entire cryptocurrency holding within your brokerage account. However, before committing funds to cryptocurrency investments. It’s important to study the fundamentals of investing to limit the risks. Pros & cons of investing in cryptocurrency There are many advantages and disadvantages to investing in and trading cryptocurrency — all of which need to be considered by new investors when opening up an account. Pros of investing in crypto Potential for high gains — Because of the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies — and the uncertainty surrounding their implementation — they have incredibly high growth potential, meaning a possibly stellar return potential for investors. Cryptocurrencies have been the highest performing assets of the last five years — with Bitcoin and Ethereum growing 1000% and 500% respectively in that time. Government-resistant store of value — Unlike the Federal Reserve — which has the ability to inflate currencies in response to crisis — cryptocurrencies are governed by their own supply and demand markets, meaning they resist fluctuations in fiat currencies. Cryptocurrencies typically have a limited number of coins in circulation, whereas the Federal Reserve can simply print more money. It’s a great way to diversify your portfolio — In addition to commodities like gold and silver that are a natural hedge against inflation, cryptocurrencies have shown extremely good profit potential that weathers the storm of financial crisis — helping you reduce risk in your long-term investment portfolio. Accessible 24/7 — Unlike stock markets — that have investing and trading windows to make deals — cryptocurrency markets are open 24/7. This lets investors place orders, take profits and monitor trends at any time. Cons of investing in crypto Market is incredibly volatile — Cryptocurrencies are extremely unregulated — much of the price fluctuations in the crypto market are governed by speculation based on cryptocurrency owners’ perceptions of their own coins and future projections. With volatility comes the potential for extremely high gains but also substantial losses if they make up too much of your portfolio. Their long-term success is yet to be proved — Despite notable coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum booming in value, many alt coins have seen a peak and have struggled to return to their five-year highs. It’s still unknown if they’re a strong investment or a bubble waiting to burst, leading to recurring economist questioning as to whether the market will survive. It’s confusing for new investors — Navigating the world of cryptocurrency investments, CFDs, leveraged trading and misinformation can lead to substantial losses for those starting out. It’s critical for those investing to understand the markets and not throw their capital in straight away. Targets for security breaches — It’s no secret that the high-value cryptocurrencies locked away in digital wallets are targets for criminals. Phishing attacks on wallet holders and misplaced security keys can give malicious actors instant access to your crypto portfolio, letting them transfer funds from unsuspecting users. Investors must contend with online misinformation — “Get rich quick” schemes and inflated predictions of the success of a cryptocurrency can cloud the judgement of novice investors. With stocks, there is more information to work with including revenue, EPS ratings, price-to-earnings ratios and compound annual growth rate (CAGR) that let users make informed decisions — where cryptocurrency is more speculative due to its infancy. Understanding crypto market volatility and risk management Because there is little in the way of regulation and oversight in the crypto market, prices are governed solely by speculation. While significant movements — like technical advancements in a cryptocurrency’s blockchain infrastructure — can cause buzz and rallies of a particular cryptocurrency, its popularity is largely dictated by cryptocurrency owners inflating the strength of their own coins. To hedge against volatility, investors and traders can make use of certain features on coin exchanges and brokerage sites to limit risk. For example, experienced investors will look to: Use crypto as a diversifier — Rather than betting their entire portfolio on cryptocurrencies booming in price, they’ll only allocate a small portion of their assets to cryptocurrency. With their money in many types of investments — like stocks, commodities and indices as well as cryptocurrency — they’re able to benefit from micro gains in each sector and limit losses. Limit the use of CFDs and leverage — CFDs and Leverage lets investors take up much larger positions on the stock market than their capital might allow. This can mean higher gains but also substantial losses should they crash. A controlled, cautious approach to leveraged investing can help limit those losses. Manage emotion — If you’re new to crypto investing, it can be easy to get swept up in the emotional side of investing — especially if a bear market hits your portfolio particularly hard. Experienced investors understand that the market moves only in response to supply and demand, making It easier for them to cash out and change tactics in response to market changes with a cool head. Work to a timeline — Experienced investors stick to a long-term plan — they don’t just throw money at cryptocurrencies in response to trends. Their investments are based on data-driven predictions, price graphs and technical and fundamental analysis. This lets them buy, hold or sell at more optimal times than people that panic buy. Tips for investing in cryptocurrency Investing in cryptocurrencies can be daunting — especially for those with limited understanding of market fundamentals. Here’s a few tips to bear in mind as a novice investor. Make use of “stop losses” and “take profit” levels “Stop loss” and “take profit” are price ranges determined by the investor. Once these levels are set in place, the broker or exchange will automatically sell their investments to help an investor limit their losses and cash out on profits when they aren’t able to manage their assets themselves — say when they’re at work. If you’re starting out, or have limited disposable capital to play with, these limits are an integral part of preserving it — especially in volatile markets. Use an exchange rather than a broker Cryptocurrency exchanges typically have lower transaction and holding fees than brokers. This makes them better options for long-term investors. Remember that the markets are constant Cryptocurrency markets never sleep — they operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. As well as your stop losses and take profit levels, it may be worth using tools to automate [DS1] your investments, so you don’t lose money on a sudden downturn. Consider using a paper account If you’re new to investing and want to get to grips with the market and understand how to navigate an exchange’s interface, you can open a paper account. This lets prospective users trade and invest in cryptocurrencies and stocks with fake money and safely test out strategies and monitor markets risk-free. You can make money when the market bears As the old adage goes — buy low and sell high. However, with modern exchanges and brokers, you can make money as a cryptocurrency depreciates. Often known as “shorting”, you can take up positions on the market that bet against a cryptocurrency. However, this is typically used by more experienced investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is crypto a good investment? There is much debate about the long-term growth potential of established cryptocurrencies, tokens and altcoins. While there is potential for high gains, investors also risk substantial losses, so they’re better suited to less risk-averse individuals. However, they have proven to be a great hedge against inflation, making them a viable addition to a diverse investment portfolio. How much should I invest in crypto? As a general rule, no more than 20% of your portfolio should be invested in any one market sector. For beginners, it’s advised to invest slightly less of your portfolio in cryptocurrency given the volatile nature of the markets. How much should I put into cryptocurrency to make money? You don’t need a lot of starting capital to invest in cryptocurrencies and make money. Although established coins — like Bitcoin and Ethereum — are priced in the thousands, brokers and exchanges let users invest in coins to the value of their capital. This means if you only have $100 to invest, you can still invest in Bitcoin and you’ll receive the equivalent value for your portfolio.

The digital token edged up 0.2% to $26.9K at 10:32 a.m. ET, after rising to as high as $27.2K in the minutes following the jobs report. SA contributor Richard Durant contended Thursday that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could continue to erase year-to-date gains as liquidity dries up in the market. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) was also changing hands slightly in the green, rising 1.3% to $1.88K. The U.S. economy added 339K jobs, easily topping the economist consensus of 180K, up from April's revised reading of 235K. At the same time, though, the jobless rate rose to 3.7%, vs. 3.5% expected, from 3.4%. The mixed report also signaled some easing in wage growth, which should calm fears of a wage-price spiral. Traders, in turn, priced in a lower chance (68.0% vs. 79.6% on Thursday) that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates unchanged at the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee's June 13-14 meeting. Meantime, the probability of a 25 basis-point rate hike rose to 32.0% from 20.4%.

This has been made possible through the BitTorrent Bridge, which allows for seamless interoperability between the two blockchains. BitTorrent Bridge Paves The Way To Ethereum Integration Interoperability in the context of blockchain refers to the ability of different blockchains to communicate and exchange information with each other seamlessly. In this case, the BitTorrent Bridge enables Tron’s native asset, TRX, to be transferred and accessed on the Ethereum network, and vice versa. Related Reading: Litecoin Breaks $95 As Whale Transactions Spike This means that TRX holders can now access the larger Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market and decentralized applications (dapps) available on Ethereum, while Ethereum users can now access TRX and its associated dApps on the Tron network. The BitTorrent Bridge acts as an intermediary between the two blockchains, facilitating the transfer of assets and data in a secure and decentralized manner. The move is a significant development for the Tron ecosystem, which is currently the second-largest DeFi ecosystem with over $5.6 billion in total value locked and more than 2.9 million active users, according to DeFiLlama data. Justin Sun’s tweet regarding the Ethereum expansion via BitTorrent Bridge has already had a positive impact on TRX’s price, with the asset jumping by 2% following the announcement. This further demonstrates the potential for Tron to expand its reach and appeal to a wider audience in the cryptocurrency industry. With Tron’s expansion to Ethereum, the cryptocurrency industry continues to see the growing importance of interoperability between different blockchains. As more projects explore the potential of cross-chain functionality, the industry is likely to see further development and innovation in the coming years. TRON Sets New Daily Transaction Record Despite the challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry in recent months, TRON has continued to perform strongly, defying expectations and posting impressive growth. According to a Twitter thread by Justin Sun, the network hit a new record high in daily transactions, processing over 10 million transactions in a single day. Furthermore, Sun notes that the robust performance of the TRON network is a result of its quality and efficiency, as well as its ability to continuously improve and deliver concrete results. Looking ahead, TRON has set an ambitious target for the year, aiming to double its transaction volume. Sun emphasizes that this increase is not just a measure of quantity, but also a reflection of the network’s ability to maintain its strong fundamentals and generate revenue even in a challenging market. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz Says This Will Kickstart The Bitcoin Bull Market Moreover, the growth in TRON’s transaction volume is expected to further bolster protocol revenue and demonstrate the strength of the TRON ecosystem. As the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve and face new challenges, TRON is positioning itself as a leader in the space by focusing on innovation, efficiency, and delivering results.

As of Nov. 7, Huobi Hong Kong had yet to submit an application, but intends to do so ""in the future,"" Gary Lee, a member of the exchange's compliance team, told CoinDesk that day.  In the June 2 interview, Sun said the exchange submitted an application to become a virtual asset service provider (VASP) the prior week; a spokesperson for Huobi, which since then had rebranded itself HTX, later said he misspoke. There is an 18-month grace period in which regulators can approve or deny the application. But Sun said on June 2 that he saw the possibility of faster action.  ""Right now we predict probably we will have the license in the next six to 12 months,"" he said during the interview.  The exchange recently moved its headquarters from Singapore to Hong Kong in hopes of launching Huobi Hong Kong after the city said it is looking to become a virtual asset hub as soon as this summer.  While it’s unknown if any other Asia-based crypto exchanges have applied for a similar license, Sun said he could see five to six other players also making the move, including OKX, Gate.io, Bitget and ByBit.  When asked about possibly competing with Coinbase and Kraken in Canada, Sun said Huobi has no plans to operate in the country given its strict regulatory requirements.  “I’ll work on all the friendly jurisdictions first,” Sun said, referring to the Caribbean, Hong Kong, and Japan in general.  UPDATE (June 2, 2023, 16:53 UTC): Adds direct quote from Sun describing his prediction for the timing of a license.

42420306,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUevbZ,1685712820,CoinDesk Turns 10: 2015 – Vitalik Buterin and the Birth of Ethereum,"You can not run the experiment again. Once a system like Ethereum starts, it can only progress, stacking blocks one atop the other. Edging forward, the system creates its own understanding of time measured in block height. Hopefully it gains users, who can fill the chain with history – after which they can “read” the ledger, validating it’s the same one broadcasted around the world, but not alter it. And yet, Ethereum’s history is full of fits and starts.  Today, Ethereum is the most active blockchain (when counting by number of developers). It supports novel financial systems worth $10s of billions, like algorithmic stablecoins and automated market makers (AMM), which could one day displace the old forms of payments and trade. It’s also no stranger to legacy firms – Visa, for instance, began using Ethereum to settle stablecoin transactions in 2021, and JPMorgan liked Ethereum enough to fork it to create Onyx.  This feature is part of our CoinDesk Turns 10 series looking back at seminal stories from crypto history. Ethereum's founding is our choice of the most important event from 2015.  At times, Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum’s five, or eight, or 15 co-creators (depending on how you measure) has doubted whether Ethereum deserves its accomplishments. In 2017, during the initial coin offering (ICO) rush that ushered in a new model of startup funding and pushed ETH’s market capitalization past half a trillion dollars, he asked on Twitter “...have we *earned* it?” Four years later, in an interview with Time Magazine, during another market rush that propelled Ethereum to unseen heights, he warned of the “dystopian potential” of digital assets if implemented incorrectly.  But would Buterin have done it differently if he could do it over? It’s a difficult question for a reporter in my shoes to pose. Given Buterin’s stature (and workload), he’s not responding to emails. So many of his co-founders (how many were there?) are in the same position, or left Ethereum in acrimony and have been accused of giving twisted accounts. Thankfully, the digital entrails still exist – the countless podcasts and blog posts Ethereum’s chief architect has left behind. And like an anthropologist on a Sisyphean search for a grand unifying theory that spans human time and culture, I can only propose:  One must imagine Buterin happy.  Despite its founder’s world-weary suspicions, Ethereum has arguably achieved much of what the founding cast set out to accomplish. The chain has fundamentally changed the way the world can conceive of finance and tech – even if its solutions ultimately are not adopted (or regulated out of existence). In an early publicity video, a boyish Buterin described Ethereum as a censorship-resistant platform for building decentralized applications (dapps). That’s as general a statement as any. But the prediction quickly proved true about a world-shaking “general-purpose technology,” to use a favorite phrase of Buterin.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - CoinDesk Turns 10: The Legacy of Mt. Gox – Why Bitcoin’s Greatest Hack Still Matters  None of this would have been possible without the flexibility and foresight programmed into Ethereum since the beginning. Or the hard lessons learned along the way. Ethereum is a story of fits and starts about an immutable chain that’s changed. It began with Buterin’s inkling of an idea in 2013, which gained credency and currency as a worthwhile endeavor in 2014 when Buterin and friends raised $18 million in a token offering (paid in 30,000 bitcoin!).The first iteration of Ethereum launched in 2015, only to be reorganized a year later following the infamous attack on “The DAO” (which my colleague David Z. Morris covered in another feature for this series.)  Most recently, the project’s stewards rewrote Ethereum’s code base to swap out its energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm for proof-of-stake (PoS), a significant shift applauded even on Capitol Hill. Notably, the overhauled chain was supposed to be called “Ethereum 2.0” – an unintentional callback to the “Blockchain 2.0” meme popular during Ethereum’s early days – but everyone stuck with Ethereum. Just Ethereum. The idea of the network transcends its code; the chain is whatever people prefer.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Opinion  Looking back at the network’s founding reveals a lot about what it means to be consistent in a quick-changing industry, and how to execute on a vision with stakeholders spread across the world, many of whom want things done differently. It’s a story that’s literally filled books (notably Laura Shin’s and Camilla Russo’s). Filled with intrigue. That’s been juiced for headlines. But this story told as CoinDesk turns 10 (Ethereum, too, depending on how you count), wants to do something different – it tells you, dear reader, the ending is foreknown, the more that changes on Ethereum, the more it stays the same.  Who are you to disagree?  Founding stories  Vitalik Buterin, the Russia-born coder raised in Canada, grew up programming video games for fun. He was largely self-taught. His computer scientist parents would buy him dummies guides to programming and send him to math camp while he attended public grade school. He learned to see computer programs as things that can be owned and controlled and quickly forgotten.  Then Blizzard, the company that runs the multi-player online game World of Warcraft popular when Buterin was a teenager, “nerfed” his favorite character.  In an interview with Morgan Peck for Wired, Buterin said that event stirred something inside of him. The world, the highschooler began to see, was full of powerful decision makers who were like “Mr. Burns, sitting behind their desks saying, ‘Excellent. How can I screw a thousand people over this time.”  It was a “cartoonish” thought, he now admits, but the idea it sparked, to build a machine that could “decentralize” anything a computer, corporation or government could do – wresting power away from financial incumbents and building more enlightened social networks than Facebook and Twitter – stuck.  At least that’s the story Buterin has told about the inspiration behind Ethereum. Whether or not it’s the same spiel he gave to Peter Thiel is unknown. But the 19-year-old computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo eventually received a Founder’s Fund scholarship to drop out and code all day everyday towards that vision.  Read more: Michael J. Casey - CoinDesk Turns 10: What We Learned From Reporting a Decade of Crypto History  Before that, for six months in 2013, he bounced around crypto meetups and hacker houses in the usual places like Amsterdam, Berlin, London, Tel Aviv and up and down the U.S. West Coast. There, he met the people looking to unravel the Web Thiel played a part in creating, the Web that went wrong, Web 2.0.  There’s a travelog of this period in Bitcoin Magazine, the publication Buterin co-founded, that gives the sense that Buterin, who has been described as robot-like on video, would not be too sentimental as a writer to miss the obvious poetry. Academic and journalist Nathan Schnieder has commended Buterin on his “reporter’s eye.”  Take just one article jokingly titled “BITCOIN GROUP THERAPY IN BERLIN TOMORROW,” where Buterin encourages anyone reading the Magazine to attend a meet-up at a once popular bar that accepted bitcoin. He anticipates a convivial scene where “everyone will be able to talk to the group for 5-10 minutes” about what they’re working on. There are plans to “gather in the sun,” to hand out.  That particular piece was written during the middle of his sojourn, but is one of the last articles where Buterin seems completely sold on Bitcoin. Somewhere along the way, the conferences began to be described as more “business-like” and the “altcoin debate” sounded more exhausting.  Read more: CoinDesk Turns 10 – 2020: The Rise of the Meme Economy  It was then that Buterin was also most exposed to the early efforts to use Bitcoin for more than “decentralized money.” If non-fungible token (NFT) and smart contract forebears like Counterparty and Colored Coins once grabbed his attention, they eventually seemed like pitfalls.  Somewhere along the way, the true inspiration for Ethereum came – the story left untold. It was likely a gradual awakening to the realization that scaling blockchains by forking or layering networks on top of Bitcoin was a dead end. If you wanted anything more than a faster version of Bitcoin (like Litecoin), you’d need to build from the ground up.  Lost too to the sands of time is the exact moment Buterin conceived the name Ethereum – whether it came to him on the road or while back home in Toronto. Buterin told The Defiant’s Cami Russo the inspiration was a Wikipedia entry on “aether,” the medieval theory of a weightless, transparent element that permeates all matter and space.  It reportedly reminded him of science books he read as a kid and the simlarly-named chemical element. But mostly the debunked theory was a rich metaphor for the type of universal network he had in mind.  See also: Ethereum's Design Choices Are Inherently Political | Opinion  ""Vitalik wanted his platform to be the underlying and imperceptible medium for every application, just what medieval scientists thought ether was,” as Russo wrote in “The Infinite Machine.” And that’s Buterin, the sentimentalist story-teller, in a nutshell.  Greedy Algorithms?  Buterin typed up the idea for Ethereum and proposed its early specs in a white paper and sent it to 15 friends and acquaintances in 2013.  Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and Bitcoin Magazine co-founder Mihai Alisie came on as early co-founders, part of the first five official backers. By the time Buterin spoke at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami a few months later, the white paper had spread widely beyond that small group. According to Bitcoin OG Bruce Fenton, a conference attendee, Buterin was mobbed by 40 people after his “unpolished” presentation.  From that moment, the Ethereum project went from an idea to a whirlwind of activity.  Legendary British programmer Gavin Wood wrote the “Yellow Paper” introducing the network’s bespoke programming language Solidity. Together with another experienced coder Jeffrey Wilcke and Buterin, Wood is also credited with building Ethereum’s first prototype and implementing the network into seven other programming languages in a matter of weeks. Buterin had settled down for a time in a Miami hacker pad financed by the independently-wealthy Canadian web developer Anthony Di Iorio.  Ethereum has arguably achieved much of what the founding cast set out to accomplish  (While Buterin is often credited with predicting and outlining a number of core crypto technologies in the Ethereum whitepaper – like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), though not non-fungible tokens – Wood’s document outlined the all-important Ethereum Virtual Machine setting the stage for a “multichain future” and Wood’s next project, Polkadot.)  Buterin today says he regrets the “greedy algorithm” he used when determining who would be brought into the fold to help build the technical and business case for the network. Essentially, it was a first-come-first-serve basis, he said on Naval Ravikant’s popular tech podcast, which led to in-fighting among Ethereum’s first inner circle.  Among the most volatile disputes was whether the organization overseeing the “free and open software” project should turn a profit. Hoskinson, for instance, wanted a corporate structure (where he would likely be CEO), while Buterin himself wanted an ostensibly non-profit organization. It was a weighty question not only because early Ethereans didn’t want to trigger U.S. securities law, but also because Ethereum badly needed funding.  The history here is muddled and filled with contradictory claims, but the scars of that debate are visible today. Hoskinson, one of the first whitepaper readers, argued against Buterin’s preference to run Ethereum through a non-profit and left to found IOHK, the company behind his blockchain Cardano. (As Laura Shin documents in her book about Ethereum, Hoskinson’s grating personality also likely accelerated the split.)  Read more: CoinDesk at 10: 2019 - The Ghost of Libra Lives On  Joseph Lubin, a banker who discovered bitcoin, helped spin up the Ethereum Switzerland GmbH (EthSuisse) corporation to house Ethereum’s early development work. He’s now being sued by early employees looking for a greater equity stake in the company and network.  “We certainly miscalculated the sheer difficulty of navigating the relevant legal processes in the United States and Switzerland, as well as the surprisingly intricate technical issues surrounding setting up a secure sale website and cold wallet system,” Buterin wrote in a blog post announcing the ether (ETH) crowdsale, posted on the Swiss-based non-profit eventually spun up called the Ethereum Foundation.  The Foundation would manage the legal and marketing efforts of the ICO campaign, which lasted from July 20 to Sept. 2, 2014. And the sale was organized by EthSuisse, which controlled the wallet Ethereum funders would send bitcoin to. There was controversy about the fundraising details from the jump, including that U.S. residents would be able to contribute – potentially opening Ethereum to legal scrutiny. There was a promise to dissolve the corporate entity after the sale, and plans for the first 4,000 BTC to go towards “expenses incurred prior to and related to Genesis Sale.”  Ethereum was not the first token sale – it wasn’t even the largest example having raised $18 million prior to the ICO bubble. But it was still the early days of alt-chain launches and surrounded by legal uncertainties. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, is said to have had a “fair launch” because its creator Satoshi Nakamoto published the code online without taking a cut. Ethereum’s sale took place in the full view of an investing public, too, in a sense, but had known founders, legal entities and “Terms and Conditions.” The Ethereum Foundation essentially created 72 million ETH tokens to bootstrap the network.  Today, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler hints that ETH could be a security. There’s an intense legal debate about the issue, including inside federal agencies. By 2018, SEC Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman said Ethereum was “sufficiently decentralized” to be considered a commodity, a view inline with the agency’s director of the time, but which the SEC now argues was just Hinman’s personal opinion. Whatever the future legal outcomes, Ethereum has certainly benefited hugely from Hinman’s largesse, especially when you consider the scrutiny placed on a project like Ripple, which launched three years earlier than Ethereum.  Earlier this year, New York Attorney General (NYAG) Letitia James filed a lawsuit against crypto exchange KuCoin, which argued in part that ETH may be classified as a security now that Ethereum has switched to a new consensus mechanism, an event that “demonstrates a degree of centralization” just because it occurred. The legal challenge was precipitated by Ethereum’s adoption of proof-of-stake, but is rooted in Ethereum’s founding.  See also: The One Word That Defines Ethereum's Goals | Opinion  “Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation also received significant quantities of ETH in the ICO and are believed to retain significant stakes of that ETH today,” James’ suit reads.  The crowdfunding is an unignorable part of Ethereum’s legacy, because it was necessary to bootstrap the network and a continual reminder that code has authors, whether or not those authors would prefer that “code is law.”  Regardless of how ETH is legally classified, which would no doubt have major repercussions for the industry, the debate around the asset is a clear example of Ethereum’s founding principle. The ability for government agents to make deliberations and revert prior decisions throws the idea of a “credibly neutral” blockchain into relief.  Social consensus  Ethereum went live on July 30, 2015 with a “barebone implementation” of the code called Frontier, nearly two years after Buterin published the project’s whitepaper and after a robust testing phase. In an effort to reduce dependencies on the Ethereum Foundation, and facilitate a more “grass roots” founding, the team set block and gas limits intended to allow miners to come online and adopters to get up to sync without having to “rush.”  “In the interest of decentralization and transparency, Ethereum will not provide the Genesis block as a download, but instead have created an open source script that anyone can use to generate the file,” early Ethereum developer Stephen Tual wrote. In a blog post around the time, Buterin reiterated the idea that “everyone must be able to see that the mechanism is fair.”  Even from that early date, Buterin had the idea that Ethereum would transition to proof-of-stake, which at that time was a largely untested and experimental way to secure blockchains. He first wrote about proof-of-stake back in 2013. Shortly after the launch of the Genesis Block, Ethereum developers introduced the “difficulty bomb,” which would allow programmatic updates making mining harder and less profitable over time, necessitating a switch to staking.  The social consensus that forms Ethereum could be seen in the network’s early adoption of “hard forks.” Unlike on Bitcoin, which fought an entire “Civil War” over a decision to update the codebase, these backwards-incompatible updates were seen as a sign that even if updates were planned among a circle of developers, the community can quickly come aboard. On March 14, 2016, for instance, when ETH hovered around $12.50, there was the “Homestead” fork that changed the protocol in a way that would make it even easier to change down the line.  In some sense, this fork was a dry run for one of Ethereum’s most monumental decisions – the rolling back of The DAO attack. As my colleague David Z. Morris wrote, on July 20, 2016, a hard fork proposal was put before ETH holders, which received 85% of the vote to allow Ethereum to revert back to a prior state after an attacker cleaned out the very first decentralized autonomous organization’s address of over 3.6 million ETH, or about 15% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply.  It’s tempting to consider this moment as a rebirth of Ethereum as we know it today, as there exists an alternative blockchain called Ethereum Classic that keeps a record of all Ethereum transactions including the DAO attacker’s. Ethereum Classic had heavy-hitting supporters, who believed that a hard fork to rescue funds for early adopters is anathema to crypto’s key values. Bitcoin was founded during the age of bank bailouts.  Buterin sees the situation differently. In a podcast with Lex Fridman, he noted the differences between holding values close to heart, and knowing when to compromise. The DAO fork was a pragmatic decision, he said, based on a particular set of circumstances. At a technical level it was possible to revert the attacker’s transactions, which is not always the case after a hack, he said. But more importantly, the network was just born, relatively, and full of promise – why risk knocking it off its feet?  See also: Did Ethereum Learn Anything From the $55M DAO Attack? | Opinion  This was arguably the understanding of Ethereum from the beginning. Reasonable people can disagree, and a blockchain’s only purpose is to make space for those opinions.  In a 2016 blog post urging more collaboration between crypto experts and researchers of artificial intelligence, the latest technical field that seems set to transform the world, Buterin provides a high-level description of the machines built on Ethereum.  “The algorithms are dumb, and yet the agents that they have to control are quite smart,” he wrote.

13101605,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=536208,1685712031,Litecoin Breaks $95 As Whale Transactions Spike,"Litecoin has recently managed to break past the $95 mark as on-chain data shows the whales have become active on the network. Litecoin Has Surged After Spike In Whale Activity According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the current whale activity is the highest it has been since January. The relevant indicator here is the “whale transaction count,” which measures the total number of transfers taking place on the Litecoin network that involve the movement of coins worth at least $100,000. Since such transactions are quite large in scale, generally only the whale entities are capable of making them. Thus, this indicator can provide us with an idea about the number of transfers that these humongous holders are making on the blockchain. Due to the sheer number of coins involved in each of these transfers, if a large amount of them take place at once, the market can register noticeable fluctuations. So, whenever the whale transaction count has a high value, the price of LTC becomes more probable to display volatility. On the other hand, when this metric has low values, the price may stay relatively calm, as it suggests that the whales aren’t making too many moves on the market right now. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Litecoin whale transaction counts over the last six months or so: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the Litecoin whale transaction count has observed a large spike recently. This means that whales have ramped up their transfer activity in the last couple of days. Related Reading: XRP Hype Spikes As Price Surges 12%, Is This A Top Signal? At the peak of this spike, the indicator had reached its highest level since January 26, 2023. These high values have come as the price has been going up, and since they have taken place, the uptrend has only continued further, with LTC managing to break past $95. Generally, when whales become active, the price volatility can go either way as the transaction count metric only tells us about the pure number of transfers happening on the chain and not about whether they are buying or selling moves. However, as the price has seemingly continued to rise following this latest spike, it may appear that the Litecoin whales could be supportive of the current uptrend. The chart also includes the data for the transaction volume, which is a measure of the daily total amount of LTC that is registering some movement on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Confluence of Bearish Factors And Could Decline Heavily This indicator has also seen a rapid increase recently, suggesting that users are moving around large amounts on the network currently. Such a trend is generally a sign of activity being high throughout the network and is often constructive for the price. This new surge in the price of Litecoin has come as the halving, an event where the coin’s block rewards will be permanently cut in half, is just a couple of months away now. LTC Price At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading around $95, up 9% in the last week.

The firm raised $65 million in funding in a round led by Credit Suisse (CS) and Deutsche Bank (DBK) in February.  Tokenization – the representation of an asset as units that can be traded in a digital format – is seen as attracting mainstream financial institutions toward the blockchain industry. Tyrone Lobban, head of JPMorgan's digital assets platform Onyx, in April referred to tokenization as the ""killer app"" for traditional finance. Last November JPMorgan executed live trades using tokenized versions of the yen and the Singapore dollar on Polygon. And in April, Bank of America published a report saying that the tokenized gold market had surpassed $1 billion the previous month.  ""Most Tier 1 financial institutions are entering the space and building capabilities to manage tokenized securities,"" Taurus said in the email. ""They all want a blockchain-agnostic and token-agnostic infrastructure.""  As a layer 2 blockchain, Polygon is designed to process transactions at a greater speed and lower cost than the main Ethereum network.

42393453,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhgC5Z,1685710330,"Solving Lightning’s ‘Inbound Liquidity’ Problem Is Focus of New Layer 2 Bitcoin Protocol, Ark","Burak Keceli, the 24-year-old self-taught Bitcoin developer and researcher who disrupted a large chunk of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network last year, is now proposing a new layer 2 protocol dubbed Ark that he says will solve Lightning’s “inbound liquidity"" problem.  Inbound liquidity is the ability to receive funds on Lightning – a layer 2 payment network introduced in 2016 that enables cheaper and faster bitcoin transactions. But that receiving capacity must first be established by committing funds and making outbound payments.  Keceli says that, much like the Lightning Network, Ark will make the dominant cryptocurrency’s transactions cheaper and faster, but the new protocol will eliminate the need for a recipient to commit funds.  “Lightning has many problems. But number one to me is the inbound liquidity problem,” Keceli told CoinDesk in an interview. “Imagine a payment system where you need money to receive money. This doesn't make any sense.”  Novices of the Lightning Network running non-custodial setups quickly realize one thing: The system works more like an abacus than a bank account. Users must commit bitcoin to a channel to create liquidity (the ability to transact on the network). Sending bitcoin (outbound liquidity) reduces your funds as expected, but receiving bitcoin (inbound liquidity) also reduces your capacity to receive additional funds, much like the limited space on an abacus.  The model makes sense for users who want to send Lightning payments (outbound liquidity), but not for users who simply want to receive them (inbound liquidity). They too must pony up funds and either send payments to generate that inbound liquidity or acquire it through other means like liquidity marketplaces.  That burdensome requirement for all Lightning users to acquire liquidity before using the system “simply should not exist,” Keceli says.  This objection, he explains, is what inspired him to create Ark.  The Turkish-born wunderkind says he has been working on Ark mostly solo and hasn’t incorporated or raised capital, choosing to keep the project open-source and donation-funded, but Ark is already receiving significant attention from prominent bitcoiners.  “​​Excited to see new ideas like Burak's, come to Bitcoin,” tweeted longtime bitcoiner and Human Rights Foundation Chief Strategy Officer Alex Gladstein.  Wrong side of the block size war  Keceli says he went down the Bitcoin rabbit hole circa 2017 after watching a YouTube video about the cryptocurrency’s mining process. He was fascinated by how a network could generate value from electricity and decided to dive in head first.  “I dug deeper into the details of how Bitcoin works under the hood,” said Keceli. “I built a bitcoin wallet based on what I had learned, and then over time, I realized Bitcoin doesn't scale.”  This all happened during Bitcoin’s contentious block size war, where part of the community, known as big blockers, called for an increase to the standard 1 megabyte size of Bitcoin blocks in order to scale network capacity. Another faction, the small blockers, who eventually prevailed, argued that blocks should be kept small to maintain decentralization.  The big blockers eventually created Bitcoin Cash, a version of Bitcoin with enormous 32 megabyte transaction blocks and additional functionality that Keceli thought would be useful in creating a Uniswap-like automated market maker (AMM).  “I thought it could scale on the base layer so I joined the big blocker camp – the Bitcoin Cash camp – and I hung out there for a few years,” Keceli said. “I wanted to build the AMM on Bitcoin Cash first.”  “But it turns out Bitcoin Cash is not expressive enough to build an AMM,” he said.  So he turned to Liquid – a federated sidechain or secondary blockchain that interacts with a primary blockchain, created by “small blocker” Bitcoin infrastructure company Blockstream. It’s a fork of Bitcoin but with additional features that Keceli and a friend used to finally build the long-envisioned automated market maker, which they eventually branded “Bitmatrix.”  Bitmatrix didn’t garner the success Keceli had hoped for, so the young developer took his talents to the Lightning Network.  “I shifted my focus to Lightning, to improve Lightning, and that's how Ark got started,” Keceli explained.  Ark in a nutshell  After Keceli turned his attention to Lightning, he confronted the myriad of problems currently besetting the network, as he describes them: poor user experience, suboptimal privacy, payment routing challenges – and then the onerous liquidity requirements.  He began working on a Lightning wallet about six months ago to address these issues, he says, and what began as an attempt to create a best-in-class Lightning wallet, morphed into a standalone protocol now known as Ark.  “At some point I realized, this doesn't look like Lightning at all,” Keceli explained. “You can pay invoices, you can get paid from invoices. It's a Lightning wallet, yes, but internally at its core, it's a different kind of design.”  Keceli says Ark is much like Lightning in that it scales Bitcoin by transacting off-chain. However, instead of requiring users to commit funds at the outset as a way of establishing liquidity, the new protocol uses Ark service providers (ASPs) who are “always on” and provide 24-hour liquidity services for a fee.  Lightning off-chain channel payments are like a game of ping-pong; coins change hands within a 2-of-2 multisig indefinitely until the channel is closed. A 2-of-2 multisignature or “multisig” transaction requires two parties to sign for the transaction to be valid.  Ark’s off-chain payments replace traditional channels with a shared unspent transaction output (UTXO) model that uses virtual unspent transaction outputs (VTXOs), which facilitate unidirectional, one-time-only payments.  “It's like an atomic single hub payment,” explained Keceli. “So it's me, I'm the sender, my partner is in the middle – my ASP, and the recipient is on the other end. We collaboratively sign the 2-of-2 to push my money to the service provider. The service provider pushes the funds minus the liquidity fee, to the recipient.”  That final push by the ASP is actually an on-chain CoinJoin – a way of combining several bitcoin payments from multiple spenders to produce a single transaction whose history and ownership are obfuscated. Keceli says CoinJoin gives Ark a privacy edge over Lightning.  If Ark succeeds, will that spell doom for Lightning? Not really, according to the developer; the two systems would complement each other.  “An Ark service provider is also a Lightning service provider,” said Keceli. “To be an Ark service provider, you run a Bitcoin node, you run the Ark service provider node, and also, you run a Lightning node.”  What’s next?  Ark’s development is still in the early stages. Keceli is currently focused on answering questions from the Bitcoin community and finalizing technical specifications. After that, he plans to put on his entrepreneurial hat and shift to prototyping and raising capital.  “The mid or long-term vision for me is to build a company like Lightning Labs, like Blockstream,” said Keceli. “So I'll be building Ark Labs, to build the key Ark infrastructure, build the client, the daemon, the CLI [command line interface], the SDK [software development kit] – the tooling around it. So I’ll be building an infrastructure company for profit, and I'll be raising for that.”",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/02/solving-lightnings-inbound-liquidity-problem-is-focus-of-new-layer-2-bitcoin-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55bbe6573efaad77ea7d30b8a6978a4e0054dfcd-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin climbed nearly 1% to back above $27,000 ahead of U.S. government’s Nonfarm Payrolls report set to release at 8:30 AM ET. The jobs reportis expected to show that the economy added 180,000 jobs in May versus 253,000 in April. On Thursday, stocks continued to move higher as the debt ceiling drama mostly moved into the rearview mirror. Gold also inched upward, with some analysts predicting the jobs report might push the metal back above $2,000. As the week draws to a close, top performing digital assets include Quant Network (QNT), which gained 16% over the last seven days and The Graph (GRT), which gained 14% in the same period.  Coinbase Derivatives Exchange, the regulated futures offering by crypto exchange Coinbase, will offer bitcoin and ether tracked futures for institutional clients starting June 5, it said in a Thursday release. Coinbase said it created these products to cater to increased institutional demand following the issuance of its nano Bitcoin (BIT) and nano Ether (ETI) contracts last year. The BTI and ETI futures contracts, sized at 1 bitcoin and 10 ether per contract, respectively, will be settled in U.S. dollars monthly, and let institutional traders hedge market bets, express long-term market views or utilize the products in complex trading strategies.  Stablecoin issuer Tether’s USDT has hit an all-time high market capitalization even as the stablecoin market overall is shrinking. The market cap for USDT topped $83.2 billion on Thursday, the company reported, surpassing its previous peak from a little more than a year ago. The news means USDT has recovered all of the $18 billion it lost since the dramatic implosion of blockchain project Terra in May 2022 and subsequent market rout. Tether’s milestone is particularly significant as it runs counter to the 14-month shrinkage in the broader stablecoin market. The total stablecoin market capitalization dropped to $130 billion in May from nearly $200 billion in early 2022.

42393465,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhgCkb,1685707999,"Crypto Investors Lost $54M to Rugpulls, Scams in May: Blockchain Security Firm De.Fi","In a turbulent month for the cryptocurrency market, May 2023 witnessed a wave of scams and hacking incidents that resulted in cumulative losses of over $54 million, a new report from security firm De.Fi shows.  The amount is a nearly half of April's $101.5 million loss, suggesting better security practices among users and developers. However, no funds were recovered in May 2023 – compared to $2.2 million recovered in April.  The BNB Chain ecosystem accounted for the majority of the incidents, with losses above $37 million across ten cases. Ethereum-based projects saw the least exploits at just over $2 million.  Among the top ten cases, Fintoch suffered the highest loss of $31.7 million due to a smart contract exploit. Jimbo Protocol on Arbitrum experienced a loss of $7.5 million due to a rugpull, while Deus Finance on BNB lost $6.2 million in a smart contract exploit.  Other notable cases included Tornado Cash, Mother, WSB Coin, Linda Yaccarino, Block Forest, SNOOKER, and land, with losses ranging from $145,000 to $733,000.  Rug pulls remained the most prevalent, accounting for twelve cases and losses totaling $37 million. There were nine cases of exploits resulting in losses of $8.8 million, while flash loan Attacks, although less frequent with five cases, still led to significant losses totaling $8.9 million. Exit scams were responsible for two cases, resulting in a loss of $177,000.  A “rug pull” is a colloquial term for a type of crypto scam that typically see the developer, or developers, gain legitimacy on social media, hype up a project and raise a significant sum of money only to drain liquidity after that project’s tokens are first offered to the public.  Flash loans, on the other hand, are a sophisticated type of exploit that allows traders to borrow unsecured funds from lenders using smart contracts instead of third parties. Attackers typically take out flash loans to manipulate the prices of a project’s token – where the smart contract is unable to detect the manipulation – and drain treasury funds.  As such, governance tokens were the most commonly targeted category, with 19 cases reported and losses totaling $3.3 million. Decentralized exchanges (DEX) were targeted in three cases, resulting in losses of $4 million. Stablecoins recorded the highest amount lost, reaching $6.2 million in a single case.  Other categories, such as yield aggregators, gaming and metaverse applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and centralized crypto platforms reported no losses during this period. Borrowing and lending protocols remained unaffected as well.",NEGATIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | ARB | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/02/crypto-investors-lost-54m-to-rugpulls-scams-in-may-blockchain-security-firm-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4b2490f30fa58bdb6ed0c1a89ed37ee02479a66-3407x2556.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Off-grid energy can allow bitcoin miners to escape some criticism of destabilizing the electricity grid due to the power consumption involved while also providing the option of selling power to the grid should it be advantageous to do so.

USDT Hits ATH According to data from multiple sources, stablecoin issuer Tether’s USDT has emerged from the gloom and doom of a declining stablecoin market to hit a record-breaking market cap of $83.2 billion. The stablecoin hit its all-time high on Thursday, taking it just over its peak from a year ago, and now commands 7.5% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. This signifies a growing demand for USDT, especially in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Despite regulatory concerns and increased competition, Tether has continued to dominate the stablecoin landscape, cementing its position as the largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Increased Scrutiny On Stablecoin Market The stablecoin market especially suffered monumentally after the dramatic implosion of the Terra/LUNA ecosystem in May 2022. It was exacerbated by the increased scrutiny from regulators and central banks around the world that wanted to prevent a repeat of the catastrophic event. Circle-issued USDC, which is the second largest stablecoin, was also hit badly by the downfall of its banking partner Silicon Valley Bank in March. Even the one-time $20 billion market cap Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin also saw its struggles when issuer Paxos was forced by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to stop minting new tokens. USDT Comes Through With Peg Stability Although USDT, too, struggled in the challenging market environment, losing around $18 billion of its market cap, it was able to regain the lost market capitalization and hit a new record high at $83.2 billion. While stablecoins have faced scrutiny from regulators and central banks around the world, Tether has managed to thrive amidst the challenging environment. Its ability to maintain a stable value pegged to the US dollar has attracted investors seeking a reliable digital asset that mitigates volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. In fact, as a report from digital asset researcher Kaiko notes, “Tether’s rise suggests peg stability is far more important for most stablecoin holders than issuer transparency.” Success And Controversy The surge in Tether's market cap can be attributed to several factors. First, the increasing adoption of digital assets by mainstream financial institutions has bolstered demand for stablecoins as a means of facilitating transactions and providing liquidity. Furthermore, Tether's market cap growth is indicative of its expanding user base. DeFi platforms also rely on stablecoins like Tether to facilitate lending, borrowing, and yield farming activities, further contributing to its rising market cap. Despite its success, Tether has not been without controversy. The stablecoin has faced allegations of lacking transparency and adequate backing for its reserves. However, Tether has consistently maintained that its reserves are fully backed by assets, predominantly cash, and short-term debt instruments.

However, not everyone is bearish on the market as Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz expects the market to turn bullish soon, and he gives reasons for why he believes this will happen. Reasons Why Bitcoin Will Begin A Bull Rally Novogratz was interviewed on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Thursday, June 1, where he gave his opinions on the Bitcoin and crypto market and where he expects the market to go. Contrary to the current market trend, the CEO remains very bullish on the digital asset and expects a bull trend going off some developments in the market right now. Related Reading: LSD Tokens Rally As Ethereum Staking Ramps Up, Here Are The Leaders He pointed toward the rising adoption from Asia as countries such as Hong Kong begin opening up new ways for retail investors to participate in the market. Not only this but the largest social messaging platform in China, WeChat, began offering Bitcoin price data to users, allowing them to check the current price of BTC in yuan. Both of these, Novogratz says, will be a catalyst for the bitcoin bull market. “Crypto’s lackadaisical right now. There’s a constant bid from retail. We’re seeing it through all the platforms,” the Galaxy Digital CEO told CNBC. BTC struggles to hold $27,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Expecting A Turn From The Federal Reserve In his interview, Novogratz also points to the fact that he expects that the Federal Reserve will change direction later this year, which he believes would be good for Bitcoin. As the Fed maintains its hawkish stance to tackle inflation, risk assets such as stocks and BTC continue to suffer but this could quickly change if the Fed becomes dovish. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Bear Market Is Far From Over, Here’s Why The CEO expects this to happen sometime in October 2023 and this, he says, will trigger a bull run for digital assets in the space. As the Fed drops interest rates, so will interest in Bitcoin rise, leading to a rapid surge in price. Given this, Novogratz expects investing in Bitcoin to be a better decision than buying a one-year T-bill. As for institutions, he points to the fact that they have reduced their participation in the market but this does not mean they’re gone. Novogratz believes the institutions will return to the second when “one of two things happens. You either need settled and sensible rules in place for crypto. Or you need the Republicans to win next year’s U.S. elections.” He further added that “Crypto has almost overnight become a crazily partisan issue, which is exactly what the industry didn’t want or need.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin is still struggling in the market, trading at $27,087 with meager gains of 0.77% in the last day.

Positioning itself as a bridge to new emerging economies, the Ethereum-backed Web3 investment platform is set to attract investors, crypto advocates, and entrepreneurs alike by offering a say in what gets built, by whom and for who in markets where they believe success is only lacking the right type of funding. The road map for the Direct Property Africa Token (DPAT) project demonstrates its scope and endurance. Initially, focusing on 15 cities in 12 countries to establish systems, processes, and legal precedent. The project team will reinvest the funds received to support the ongoing development of custom solutions such as a seamless marketplace checkout and simple developer onboarding processes. Project Lead for DPAT, Mustafa A said: “The feedback from our community matters to us, and we have taken that into account. We continue to build applications with the end user in mind and revamping our website and processes to provide an enhanced user experience is a sign of things to come.” Beyond the new website built to make it easier to navigate and access project information, the marketplace will help developers smoothly list their projects and engage with their community by offering rewards and equity-based NFTs to swiftly raise capital at prices that are competitive with banks and other traditional lenders. To further show its support to the African real estate industry, DPAT will work closely with agents and developers in project cities to increase knowledge, simplicity and security through implementation and integration of Web3 technology to digitise and update current business models. The project is currently in its presale phase and shortly after completion in August, Direct Property Africa will roll out the NFT crowdsourcing marketplace and increase its core team. DPAT will initially launch on Uniswap and list on tier 1 centralized exchanges a few weeks later. With an ambitious road map, DPAT is on track to disrupt how developers finance projects and the community access African assets. All while showcasing a different side and image of the continent. About Direct Property Africa Token (DPAT) Direct Property Africa is a Web3 real estate and infrastructure ecosystem including a crowdsourcing marketplace for local developers to raise funding for projects in major African cities like Cape Town, Lagos and Accra with fractional ownership using asset-backed equity NFTs. DPAT is the utility token of the Direct Property Africa ecosystem offering rewards and privileges to holders.

Worse jobless figure expected With Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell intimating that he is ok with the economy going into recession and “things breaking”, as long as inflation can be beaten, it does look as if the US is entering a risk off period for quite some time. One of the main figures that the Fed looks at before deciding whether the economy needs yet another interest rate hike is the jobless count. The forecast here is for a rise to 3.5% from the previous figure of 3.4%. However, even amidst this gloomy period Bitcoin is still looking like it has entered its bull market and current times are perhaps good ones for accumulating ahead of a possible descent into recession next year. Bitcoin wakes up positive Bitcoin woke up this morning in a positive mood and is moving higher again in its sideways range from around $25,800 to $27,670. Current price is at just over $27,000. Ethereum to steal the show Be that as it may, ethereum looks as though it is making its move in order to steal the show from bitcoin. Ethereum has broken the downwards trendline with bitcoin that has been in force since early January this year. Ethereum dominance has also broken higher and has returned to the levels also seen in early January, but far more importantly these are the same levels from May 21, and even as far back as September 17. A solid and continuous accumulation above this level can potentially see ethereum on route to a flippening of bitcoin. Altcoins running Many of the altcoins are running strongly right now. Arbitrum, the ethereum layer 2 solution, is up around 8% at time of going to press. Andrew Kang, a large holder, is rumoured to have leveraged his position to buy more. Injective Protocol is an altcoin that just runs and runs. It is currently up 10.5% on the day. Ocean, one of the AI-related plays is up 7.4% today having climbed 27.7% just since May 29.

42393461,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhgCQ5,1685700949,Bitcoin Miners Are Probably Selling Their Output at the $28K Level: Matrixport,"Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing selling pressure at the $28,000 price level, and miners may be responsible, crypto-services provider Matrixport said in a report Friday.  Matrixport said it suspects that bitcoin miners are being forced to liquidate any new inventory produced because profit margins have compressed in recent weeks, the report said.  Mining has become very competitive, and often unprofitable, due to the continuous increase in bitcoin miner difficulty, the report added. Mining difficulty – the measure of how easily miners can discover a new block of bitcoin – hit an all-time high earlier this week.  “At the current input cost and potential output revenue expectations, most of the machines produced before 2022 appear to be unprofitable,” wrote Markus Thielen, head of research.  This means miners are forced to sell their inventory at the current level instead of holding on till prices increase as Matrixport foresees, the note said.  “There is now significant upside convexity for miners as profitability could increase fourfold if bitcoin prices increase by 10% plus,” the note added.

This rally was a result of an accelerated rate of ETH staking, which has led to a surge in the balances of these liquid staking protocols. LSD Tokens Take Advantage Of The Surge As the total amount of ETH staked on the Ethereum network rose, so did the value of LSD tokens rise. Over the last day, coins like Lido Finance (LDO) and Rocket Pool (RPL) have been on the rise. The latter also emerged as the number 3 top gainer with almost 10% gains in the last 24 hours.

The poll saw 45% opposed to turning on proposal fees, while support for two fee plans was divided. A Divided Community The community vote ran neck and neck and concluded at 1.05 PM ET on Thursday, with extremely close results and a divided community. Looking closely at the poll, 45% of the votes expressed complete opposition to the proposal to turn on fees. 42% of the votes supported the proposal to charge 1/5 of the pool fee across Uniswap V3 pools, while the remaining 12% voted in favor of charging 1/10 of the pool fee, and 0.04 voted in favor of charging 1/6 of the pool fees. “Uniswap fee switch vote neck and neck in the final hours. Fun fact, I don’t think any UNI vote that’s passed on snapshot has been turned down once proposed on-chain.” Divided Support However, it is worth noting that the proposal failed to pass despite 54% of the votes cast favored charging liquidity providers protocol fees. However, those supporting protocol fees were sharply divided regarding how much liquidity providers must be charged, as seen in the breakup of the voting preferences. This meant that while support for charging a fee collectively surpassed the opposition to implementing a fee (55% vs. 45%), no category exceeded the support for the “no fee” votes. 56 million UNI tokens were used to cast the votes. Another factor that potentially swung the votes towards those that voted against implementing a fee was a handful of wallets that voted against protocol fees at the last minute. A closer look at the history of the wallets in question revealed that the addresses linked to the wallet were only recently created and had nearly zero transaction history prior to the vote. Chris Blec, a DeFi researcher, commented on the results stating, “The whales that dominate Uniswap governance (a16z, Hayden, etc.) refuse to activate the fee switch because they don’t want to create a legal liability. The irony is that they’re still creating legal liability by using their massive voting power to kill every fee switch proposal.” The result will not prevent further votes by the community on the proposal. While support is high, opposition to the fee is also significant. Should The Fee Be Implemented? The initial proposal behind introducing protocol fees stated that the fee would demonstrate Uniswap’s revenue-generating capabilities. The protocol stated that the fee would also indicate that liquidity providers are operating professionally and earning enough revenue to not require any sort of rebates. Governance members expressed some support for the proposal, but many noted that the decision to implement fees could carry legal and regulatory implications, with regulators potentially considering a fee-generating Uniswap as a security. Furthermore, the proposal could require the payment of income tax as well. The current proposal indicated that it would not impact fees paid by most Uniswap users and would collect fees directly from liquidity providers. The proposal was put forward on the 10th of May by GFX Labs, the Uniswap Governance Delegate. The protocol’s current fee structure offers several rebates to liquidity providers, who made over $77 million in fees during the month of March alone. While putting forward the proposal, its author, Getty Hill, stated, “If Uniswap can monetize and bring in all these dollars by building a really great open-source protocol that gets usage, then that will incentivize other folks to do this too. I’m hopeful that this kind of changes some of those industry norms.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42393449,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhgBfv,1685693749,Uniswap Community Votes Down Protocol Fees for Liquidity Providers,"A significant portion of Uniswap community turned down a proposal for charging fees from liquidity providers (LPs) on the protocol in a surprising vote, which ended on Thursday.  Over 45% of the community voted for ‘no fee,’ while 42% voted for one-fifth of the fee generated by Uniswap version 3 (V3) pools to be charged to LPs. A much smaller 12% of the community voted for one-tenth of the fees to be doled out, while a nominal 0.04% voted for one-fourth.  LPs are large market makers, with millions or more in locked up assets, that facilitate user trading on Uniswap and in turn earn a cut of fees in each trade. LPs are currently not charged anything by the platform for using the platform.  An early temperature check for such a feature in December concluded that users were positive about the change but remained cautious – as it meant lesser earnings for LPs and risk of capital flight.  Results of the poll could likely mean a formal poll expected for later this year incorporates community sentiment and changes parameters to keep community members satisfied.  But a GFX Labs' proposal floated earlier this year strived to change that. “Uniswap is in a strong position to turn on protocol fees and prove that the protocol can generate significant revenues,” the developer firm said in early May.  “We need to reaffirm that liquidity providers are protocol users and do not need full rebates.

According to the company, the move will replace the bridged version of the stablecoin from Ethereum, which is currently in circulation. Native To Arbitrum With the announcement by Circle, USDC will be native to Arbitrum and will be the official version of the stablecoin recognized across the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will also eventually replace the bridged version of the stablecoin from Ethereum. In its statement, Circle stated that Arbitrum would rename the Ethereum-bridged version of the USDC stablecoin as USDC.e ahead of the launch of the native USDC on the 8th of June, 2023. The company added that it would also conduct an outreach to other apps in the ecosystem to make the same changes in their documentation and application UI. “USDC issued by Circle will be native to Arbitrum and will be considered the official version of USDC for the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over time, native USDC liquidity will grow and replace the currently circulating ‘bridged USDC’ liquidity that comes from Ethereum.” Benefits Of The Native USDC Circle highlighted several benefits of the native USDC launching on the highly popular Arbitrum layer-2 network. According to the company, the biggest advantage would be bringing Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to Arbitrum. This would eliminate bridge withdrawal delays. Other benefits highlighted by Circle include upgradable smart contracts and the possibility of introducing institutional on and off-ramps, along with other improvements. Upgradable smart contracts would allow Circle to conduct future enhancements to the contract. Circle also talked about liquidity migration in its statement, asserting that Arbitrum would collaborate with all ecosystem apps to ensure a smooth transition of liquidity from bridged USDC to native USDC. The Arbitrum Bridge will not undergo any immediate changes during the transition period. It will continue operating normally and bridge USDC to and from Ethereum. What The Future Holds Moving forward, Circle hopes to bring CCTP to Arbitrum following the launch of the native USDC stablecoin, which would allow the stablecoin to move natively to and from Ethereum and other chains within minutes, eliminating withdrawal delays. The announcement comes a month after Circle had announced the mainnet availability of the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP). Circle has also announced plans to expand the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol to other chains in late 2023. Back in April, Circle’s Vice President of Product, Joao Reginatto, explained that the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol would give USDC native interoperability across the Web3 ecosystem. He further added that it would help the protocol address issues related to capital inefficiency and liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi). “With CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience, and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe, and fungible asset in native USDC. This milestone makes USDC a natively multi-chain digital dollar.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Hinman Documents Expected to Be Unsealed by June 13 The highly anticipated public release of the Hinman speech documents and emails is reportedly set for June 13, 2023. Before these documents can be unsealed, one of Ripple’s most notable executives, Susan Friedman, Ripple’s head of policy, is focusing on a crucial hearing linked to the crypto industry ahead of the public release of the Hinman documents. While the upcoming June 13 HFSC hearing is an important one for crypto, the one being held next week by @HouseAgGOP is equally so. @CongressmanGT has been a steadfast supporter of the call for clarity in this space. https://t.co/DLLUjDzhQr — Susan Friedman (@ss_friedman) June 1, 2023 The crypto industry and Ripple executives such as Susan Friedman eagerly await June 6 hearing that the House Committee on Agriculture is organizing. The hearing entitled “The Future of Digital Assets: Providing Clarity for Digital Asset Spot Markets” will delve into the nuances of crypto markets and provide some much-needed clarity for the crypto spot market. June 6 Hearing is Crucial Before The Hinman Documents Can Be Unsealed Key to note here is that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) falls under the jurisdiction of the House Agriculture Committee. The CFTC and the SEC have been the two leading agencies actively cracking down on the crypto industry and pushing regulatory charges around digital assets-linked firms. The SEC, in particular, have been accused of not providing clear rules for the market. It was recently sued by crypto exchange Coinbase for allegedly ignoring its petition for clear crypto guidance. The June 6 hearing by the House Committee on Agriculture comes as a crucial time, just a month before the highly anticipated release of the Hinman speech and emails. The Hinman documents also include unredacted versions of cross-motions for summary judgement and accompanying exhibits in the XRP lawsuit, Coingape reports. The Hinman Documents – What do they entail? Ripple gained a small victory in October in its ongoing case with the SEC, when the latter was forced to give up the Hinman documents, which could help Ripple prove in its case that XRP is, in fact, not a security. The documents include discovery material proving that the former Director of Corporation Finance, Willian Hinman, delivered a speech in which he clearly stated that neither Bitcoin (BTC) nor Ether (ETH) is securities. Video evidence of Hinman claiming that neither tokens are a security emerged. In the recording, Hinman states: Based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, Remains Confident - Market Reacted Well Ripple’s chief executive Brad Garlinghouse told Forbes he predicts the case, dragging on since 2020, will conclude in “weeks, not months.” Garlinghouse’s statement shot XRP’s price up by over 10% over last week, and it currently trades at $0.51, according to data by CoinMarketCap. XRP has tested the critical resistance at $0.50, but many wonder if the rally will continue. Technical analysis from news agency CryptoPotato indicates that XRP has shown a consistent upward trend after being rejected from its 200-day moving average at around $0.4. XRP also managed to surpass its 50-day moving average of approximately $0.45 and seems to target its resistance zone at $0.6 in the short term. If XRP successfully breaks through the $0.6 level, it would likely spur a bullish phase, with prices potentially reaching highs of $0.9 mid-term. Investors should, however, be cautious as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates we are in an overbought market, suggesting a pullback or a period of consolidation may be seen in the next few days. Garlinghouse further told Tai Panich, the chief executive of SCB 10x, in a YouTube interview: I feel very confident that we’ll see a decision from the courts this year. Adding: In fact, I think I would guess that it will be in weeks, not months. The Ripple CEO also commented on the decision for the Hinman documents to be made public. Another win for transparency! Unredacted Hinman emails to be publicly available soon - stay tuned as the lawyers work through the mechanics to make that happen. https://t.co/o6puPypRHd https://t.co/qmaLVeQaP8 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 16, 2023 He told Forbes: The court just ruled last week that the notes in the emails associated with that are going to be made public, and should be public around June 13. So I think that’s a huge win for transparency. But what it really calls out is, there really hasn’t been clarity, despite calls and demands from leaders across the crypto industry. Forbes further reports that while crypto exchange Kraken and crypto lenders such as BlockFi chose to settle with the SEC, Ripple decided to fight it and go to court. Garlinghouse said: Ripple decided to lean in and fight this fight, both for Ripple and the whole industry. We’ve spent a lot of money defending it. And I think what we’ve called out is the government in the United States, and the SEC particularly, is putting politics ahead of smart policy. Things Are Looking Up for Ripple A recent Messari report revealed that XRP surged by over 55% in Q1 2023, outperforming the overall crypto market. The report further shows that XRP’s market cap increased from $17.4 billion on January 1 to an impressive $27.4 billion on March 31, representing a Q1 surge of 59.9%. Ripple further announced it made a $250 million acquisition of Metaco – a well-known crypto custodian. Seen as a positive sign for the future of both Ripple and Metaco, the move sees Ripple take on sole responsibility at Metaco while still allowing current CEO Adrien Traccani to manage operations independently. Today, we are proud to announce Ripple has acquired @metaco_sa, becoming the sole shareholder of the Swiss-based provider of digital asset custody and tokenization technology.Learn more: https://t.co/GrI3u13iDT — Ripple (@Ripple) May 17, 2023 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Deutsche Telekom aims to explore new revenue streams and enhance network security through its participation as a validator. The company's subsidiary, Deutsche Telekom MMS, will operate as a validator for Polygon, contributing to the security, governance, and decentralization of the platform. As a validator, Deutsche Telekom will run a full node, produce blocks, validate transactions, and participate in the consensus process. This move strengthens the overall integrity and interoperability of the Ethereum ecosystem. Dirk Röder, Head of the Blockchain Solutions Center at Deutsche Telekom, views the collaboration with Polygon as a significant milestone for the company's aspiration to become a key player in Web3 infrastructure. Deutsche Telekom aims to serve institutional clients as a reliable enterprise-grade staking provider and leverage the existing infrastructure to monetize the native token of the underlying blockchain network. This strategic move allows Deutsche Telekom to tap into the growing potential of blockchain technology and establish a foothold in the evolving digital economy. The involvement of mainstream telecommunications companies like Deutsche Telekom in the Web3 space can contribute to the greater decentralization of proof-of-stake blockchains. Röder emphasizes the importance of having a diverse and reliable validator set in a decentralized ecosystem. Other telecommunications companies are also exploring opportunities in this domain, fostering a more robust network infrastructure for blockchain platforms. Michael Blank, CEO of Polygon Labs, believes that collaborations between blockchain projects and mainstream businesses like Deutsche Telekom can pave the way for wider adoption of blockchain technology across various industries. The partnership not only strengthens Polygon's network security and governance but also showcases the practical applications of blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies. Polygon's blockchain ecosystem offers a suite of protocols for developers to access major scaling solutions, including zero-knowledge rollups, sidechains, app-specific chains, and data availability protocols. As a validator, Deutsche Telekom MMS will contribute to the security and decentralization of Polygon's proof-of-stake sidechain and Supernets app-chains. Currently, Polygon's PoS chain hosts numerous decentralized applications, processing millions of daily transactions and locking over $1.2 billion in Total Value Locked. Deutsche Telekom's participation as a validator on Polygon demonstrates the increasing recognition of the potential of blockchain technology by established companies in the telecommunications industry. This collaboration strengthens Polygon's network infrastructure while bridging the gap between traditional businesses and the blockchain ecosystem. The partnership between Deutsche Telekom and Polygon highlights the continued growth and integration of blockchain technology into mainstream operations. Such collaborations between traditional industry firms and blockchain companies advance the possibilities for transformative applications and advancements in the digital landscape, merging new horizons to expand the use case and adoption of blockchain technologies beyond crypto.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin remained below $27K, but an analyst says that the largest crypto by market value is in an ""accumulation phase.""

Bitcoin was recently trading at about $26,835, roughly flat over the previous four hours but down 1.2% from Wednesday, same time, according to CoinDesk Indexes. The largest cryptocurrency has seemed almost entirely unaffected by the Wednesday, late-night U.S. House vote to pass a debt ceiling increase that would ensure the government can pay its bills, at least short-term. The Senate will likely vote on the bill late Thursday night (ET).  But in an email to CoinDesk, Bob Baxley, the CTO of DeFi infrastructure platform Maverick Protocol, wrote that crypto markets may now have to reckon with a U.S. Treasury having to replenish its general account, which has shrunk in recent months. That could sap liquidity otherwise available for digital asset investments.  “The risk here is that the roughly trillion dollars flowing back into the general account could suck a tremendous amount of liquidity out of the market,"" Baxley wrote. ""Something like this happened in 2019, and the strain placed on the market basically compelled the Federal Reserve to step in and add emergency liquidity to prevent a full-blown crisis. So, in short, just because a deal has been reached doesn’t mean we are out of the woods yet.""  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently trading at about $1860, up 0.6% over the past 24 hours. ETH spent part of Thursday in the green on a day when most assets dithered in negative territory. GRT, the token of the The Graph indexing protocol and popular memecoin SHIB tumbled more than 7% and 4%, respectively. But litecoin continued its recent winning ways to rise more than 3%. LTC has risen 7.5% over the past 30 days as investors eyed its halving two months away and increased trading activity.  Read More: Litecoin Starts June Strong as Investors Eye August Halving, Uptick in Activity  In its opening hour Friday, the Nikkei Index rose about 0.6%. U.S. equities closed largely up, despite ongoing concerns about the inflation and the potential for more hawkish interest rate hikes this year.  Maverick's Baxley wrote optimistically that crypto investors seem ""to be a general accumulation phase.""  ""The moving averages are pointing to neutral or perhaps a little more bullish, suggesting that we are in the process of building another foundation for another leg upwards,"" he wrote, noting that markets had already priced in potential U.S. central bank rate hikes, which in the past have shaken prices.  He added: ""What matters most in this day and age is liquidity. And much of what plays out in the coming weeks likely depends on how carefully the Treasury can carry out its replenishing process. Most investors are taking a rather cautious approach right now as a result, I suspect.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Decentraland MANA +2.2% Entertainment Gala GALA +1.6% Entertainment Avalanche AVAX +0.6% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Shiba Inu SHIB −3.3% Currency Loopring LRC −2.4% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK −1.7% Computing  Insights  BRC-20 tokens are pushing toward a market cap of $500 million, and new data from Glassnode shows that they continue to be a lucrative source of fees for miners.  According to on-chain data, inscriptions now account for 25% of all transaction fees and roughly 40% of all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.  While inscriptions remain controversial within the broader bitcoin community, for miners they’ve been a boon.  A miner's revenue comprises two elements: block rewards, currently 6.25 BTC ($167,709), and transaction fees that fluctuate based on network demand, with fees traditionally being lower than rewards since 2017.  Data from CryptoQuant shows that the fees-to-reward ratio for bitcoin miners has swung in favor of miners thanks to inscriptions and ordinals.  The fees-to-reward ratio is up to 7.22%, compared to an average of around 2-3% earlier this year.  As an example of how this is helping miners’ bottom line, over the last three months, bitcoin has risen 16% while Valkeryie’s mining ETF, WGMI, is up a whopping 42%.  However, this might not last forever, as the unexpected surge in miners' revenue may be short-lived due to high transaction fees driving users toward alternatives like the Lightning Network and stablecoins.

The CFTC issued a proposal Thursday to invite comments on possible changes to the agency’s risk management program, and Romero said in a statement that “technologies like digital assets, artificial intelligence, and cloud services, also have emerged as areas that can carry significant risk.”  “These technological advancements, with their accompanying risks, necessitate the commission revisiting our regulatory oversight, including our risk management requirements,” Goldsmith Romero said. “Integration of digital assets with banks and brokers, and the risks that could be posed, could continue to evolve.”  She also flagged the ongoing issues regarding the industry’s custody practices, saying “brokers may explore holding customer property in the form of stablecoins or other digital assets that could result in unknown and unique risks.”  The CFTC will take public comments for 60 days on its “advance notice of proposed rulemaking” – the preliminary stage of a rule process that would have to be followed by a formal, proposed rule and then a vote on a final version.
