13222761,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=471490,1631577249,Fidelity Survey: 9 Out Of 10 Investors Find Digital Assets Appealing,"Fidelity Digital released a survey report recently displaying substantial growth in a number of categories surrounding digital assets. Across Europe and the U.S., year-over-year growth existed in almost every category, which includes current exposure and perception and appeal. Let&apos;s take a deeper dive into the survey and some of it&apos;s takeaways. Crypto Catalysts: Fidelity&apos;s Findings The 40-slide report outlines survey insights from over 1,000 respondents in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. between December 2020 and April 2021. Respondents included financial advisors, high-net-worth investors, hedge funds, family offices, endowments and foundations, and the like. Roughly half of the surveyed investors already had an investment in digital assets, with Asia and Europe showing higher rates of investment than the U.S. 70% of all surveyed investors had a neutral-to-positive perception of digital assets, and nine out of ten respondents said that they found digital assets to be appealing. Furthermore, roughly eight out of ten surveyed investors felt that digital assets have a place in a portfolio. What assets are investors targeting? Surprisingly, only 21% of surveyed U.S. investors own bitcoin, compared to 46% of surveyed investors in Europe and 45% of surveyed investors in Asia, respectively. Surveyed U.S. respondents also showed lower indexed crypto holdings of other major tokens as well, including ethereum, litecoin and...",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | LTC,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fidelity-investors-find-digital-assets-appeal/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png
42412028,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otcEvP,1631577238,US Lawmakers Float New Crypto Tax Provisions in Reconciliation Bill,"House Democrats are hoping to close two possible loopholes within tax regulations for cryptocurrencies, according to a proposal published Monday.  According to a document published by the House Ways and Means Committee, which is headed by Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), lawmakers believe they can fund fiscal priorities through some “corporate and international tax reforms.”  The pair of provisions intends to prevent individuals from reporting a tax loss by selling cryptocurrencies at a loss but immediately (meaning within 30 days) buying the same cryptocurrencies.  The other provision intends to ensure taxpayers properly report capital gains, even if they purchase an offsetting position on their investments.  The first provision states:  This provision includes digital assets in the constructive sale rules, anti-abuse rules previously applicable to other financial assets. The constructive sale rules in section 1259 treat the adoption of certain offsetting positions to previously owned positions as sales of the previously owned position. These rules prevent taxpayers from locking in investment gains without realizing taxable gain. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021.  While the second states:  This section includes commodities, currencies, and digital assets in the wash sale rule, an antiabuse rule previously applicable to stock and other securities. The wash sale rule in section 1091 prevents taxpayers from claiming tax losses while retaining an interest in the loss asset. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021.  The Washington Post reported Sunday that these proposals anticipate raising $16 billion in tax revenue from the cryptocurrency sector.  The House document is intended to help support a $3.5 trillion infrastructure package Democrats hope to pass in the coming months. The “Build Back Better Act” is a cornerstone of U.S. President Joe Biden’s agenda, and has been championed by progressive Democrats in both the House and Senate.  The House committee is also marking up certain tax-related provisions of the broader Senate bipartisan infrastructure bill. That includes the controversial crypto tax provision that the industry unsuccessfully fought last month.  The overall House is expected to vote on the bill in two weeks.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/13/us-lawmakers-float-new-crypto-tax-provisions-in-reconciliation-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2590e199547b8a17d579695fc55f46c8fbf9e3ca-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blockchain companies Mojix, Wholechain and Tag One were among 12 companies recognized for creating low-cost traceability solutions for food supply chains. The FDA received 90 entries from around the world, selecting winners for their impact, range of uses and “variety of approaches, platforms and technical designs,” the agency said in a press release on its website.  Mojix uses decentralized item ledgers and logistics to streamline and digitize supply chain automation.  Wholechain employs blockchain-based traceability to help coordinate fragmented supply chains for companies such as Topco Associates and Food City.  TagOne minimizes regulatory and legal risk by helping companies more closely monitor their supply chains from “seed-to-sale” through blockchain-based solutions.  The challenge is part of the New Era of Smarter Food Safety blueprint, a federal program that is meant to encourage creative financial solutions that can boost efficiency and lower costs in food supply chains.  While the challenge awards no cash prize, winners are given the opportunity to present their ideas at a YouTube forum that will take place on Sept. 28 at 18:00 (UTC).",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/13/blockchain-companies-among-winners-of-fda-food-traceability-challenge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55286511751371d1a2bf372ede4e8af40f290b14-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The team behind MetaDrop is hoping novel distribution methods and a collaboration with a top crypto personality can do the trick.  The self-described “Kickstarter for NFTs” launched Monday, and a buzzy auction from loomdart, a popular crypto influencer, is set to begin on Tuesday.  While there is a voracious market appetite for NFT projects, the competition between new marketplace startups is stiff. Incumbent OpenSea remains dominant with $3.4 billion in volume processed last month. That said, curated platforms like Foundation, which launched in late 2020, have secured a foothold with a 30-day volume of over $77 million, according to DappRadar.  MetaDrop is aiming to stand out by applying a curatorial model not just to the work released on the platform, but also to the manner in which it’s released. According to “psyopcop,” one of the founders of the project, MetaDrop will design a new “custom sale mechanism” for each individual drop it hosts.  Read more: NFT Trading Surges 8X as Penguins, Apes Drive New Boom  Current drop models, which often make a run of 10,000 NFTs available for purchase at a set time, can be wildly profitable for artists and platforms, but lead to “gas wars” as buyers attempt to secure an NFT by increasing the Ethereum network transaction fee they pay.  Drops have been straining Ethereum as of late and have even led to deflationary periods for the network as burns exceed block reward issuance following the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, an upgrade to the network made in August.  MetaDrop is also planning to primarily fund itself through positions taken in projects launched on the platform, rather than with a marketplace fee.  “We plan to only work with projects we believe in, and so our fee is generally taken partially as a stake in the project itself as well as a small commission to fund the custom development work,” psyopcop told CoinDesk on Telegram, adding:  “The exact fee amount varies depending on the complexity of the drop and the details of the project, but in general, we want to be supporters of the projects launching through us, not leeches taking huge cuts of the funds raised.”  Psyopcop declined to give examples of drop types, but said that “each one will be unique and groundbreaking in its own way.”  The six-man team plans to initially host one drop per month, and will scale up once the platform has proven to be stable.  Influencers galore  The first release hosted on MetaDrop has been teased for weeks on Crypto Twitter: loomlock, an NFT collection from loomdart, who is also a member of the angel investing collective eGirl Capital.  As has become standard practice with high-profile drops, individualized or “honorary” NFTs from the collection were distributed to influencers in order to build excitement in advance of the primary drop. The loomlock team cast an unusually wide net in this regard, sending more than 60 to community members.  As was the case with the honorary collection, the drop of 9,000 NFTs will feature “wassies” – tiny creatures designed in the mold of inversebrah, a trader who has been role-playing as one of the critters for over three years.  Wassie lore and culture largely centers on Twitter users pretending to cook or torture them during times of bearish market action, and many use the platypus-like images as their profile picture.  In an interview with CoinDesk on Telegram, loomdart said the drop will feature wassies with various attributes and features of differing rarity. The distribution will be through a custom-designed English-style auction.  “This auction mechanism was designed with the goals of loomlock in mind which included avoiding gas fees, making the sale as accessible as possible while knowing that there will be massive demand, and making the sale be a fun event and positive user experience as opposed to a stressful sale that goes by in an instant,” psyopcop told CoinDesk. He went on:  “The three-day English auction accomplishes all of these reasonably well. Users can place a bid at any point during the auction, gas to bid should be quite cheap and there are no additional transactions requiring gas needed, and users can choose to bid however much they want. Whales who can afford it can bid higher to increase the likelihood of winning, but they will end up paying more than users who take a risk and bid lower.”  In addition to granting buyers their own wassie, the loomlock NFTs will be redeemable for a physical consumer good: a “physical lockout device designed to help you improve willpower and restore control of your life from addictions and vices,” per the drop website.  Psyopcop also hinted that the loomlock NFTs could have future utility on the platform as well.  “We designed a unique sale mechanism for the loomlock launch, but the initial sale is just the beginning as there are a lot of interesting collaborations in the works between MetaDrop and loomlock,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/13/metadrop-taps-investor-loomdart-to-stand-out-from-nft-pack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7e041b71d04d0aa46163b72b519da11721cab0c-4288x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374469,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZmop,1631566889,Biden’s CFTC Picks Include Crypto Law Scholar,"U.S. President Joe Biden plans to nominate law professor Kristin Johnson and government official Christy Goldsmith Romero to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Acting CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam to be the Senate-confirmed head of the regulatory agency.  If nominated and confirmed, Johnson and Goldsmith Romero would double the current number of CFTC commissioners, following Brian Quintez’s departure last month and Dan Berkovitz’s announcement that he will step down in the middle of October. Behnam, who has served as acting chairman since January, and Dawn Stump are the remaining commissioners at the commodities regulator.  The White House announced Biden’s intent to nominate the three individuals but did not say when he will submit the nominations to the Senate for approval. After he does, the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee will hold hearings to vet the candidates and vote to advance the nominations before the overall Senate can vote on the nominees.  Johnson, a law professor at Emory University, specializes in complex financial products regulation, including market trading, clearing and settlement, according to a White House press release.  Goldsmith Romero is the special inspector general for the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, where she has served since 2012. She previously served as counsel in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the CFTC’s securities-focused counterpart. According to her LinkedIn profile, she teaches cryptocurrency regulations at the University of Virginia, where she is an adjunct professor.  Biden’s announcement comes as lawmakers pay closer attention to the cryptocurrency industry. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the Senate’s bipartisan infrastructure bill at the end of September, as the House Ways and Means Committee proposed raising tax revenue through updating constructive and wash sale regulations around digital currencies.

The cryptocurrency is roughly flat over the past 24 hours after Walmart stated that it “had no knowledge of the press release issued by GlobeNewswire, and it is incorrect.”  Also on Monday, business software company MicroStrategy announced that it bought an additional 5,050 BTC. The company now holds 114,042 BTC, which were acquired for a total of $3.16 billion and at an average price of $27,713 per bitcoin, reports CoinDesk’s Tanzeel Akhtar.  On the regulatory front, stablecoins are under increasing pressure as U.S. officials discuss launching a formal review into whether tether and other stablecoins threaten financial stability, according to Bloomberg. President Biden’s working group plans to issue stablecoin recommendations by December.  On Sunday, Cardano, an open-source public blockchain, issued a network upgrade dubbed Alonzo. The update is a key part of the Goguen era, which focuses primarily on building smart contract capabilities, reports CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair. Cardano’s ADA token is down about 10% over the past 24 hours.

Blockchain data shows a large accumulation of BTC occurred just between the $29,000 and $50,000 price levels. Buyers can either book a profit at current prices or defend support around the bottom of the two-month price range.  Crypto research firm Glassnode defines long-term holders as high-conviction buyers with BTC aged around 155 days.  “We can also see that LTH (long-term holders) owned supply has reached 79.5% of all BTC coins this week, which is equivalent to the level reached in October, prior to the bull market kicking off,” Glassnode wrote in a blog post.  The firm also noted that peaks in LTH supply typically coincide with the late stage of a bear market. It is possible that investors accumulated positions after the May sell-off, although buying momentum has weakened over the past month.  Meanwhile, blockchain data also shows short-term bitcoin holders selling at a loss (below their cost basis). Some analysts believe that is a bullish sign.  “When short-term (holders) are in disbelief and unloading their bags, that’s an indication of a start to the next bull run,” CryptoQuant wrote in a blog post.  Solana funds outshined bitcoin last week  Crypto funds focused on Solana’s SOL token garnered almost $50 million of inflows last week, while bitcoin funds brought in a “paltry” $200,000.  Overall, crypto funds brought in $57 million of new money in the seven days through Friday, the fourth straight week of inflows, according to a report Monday by the digital-asset manager CoinShares.  Altcoin roundup  Arbitrum vaults onto layer 2 leaderboard. The so-called layer 2 scaling product that works alongside the Ethereum blockchain to accelerate transactions, has seen a nearly 10-fold rise since Friday in the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The project currently holds $2.23 billion in assets in various DeFi projects, up from $238 million on Friday, reports CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.  Solana’s (SOL) trading volume surged over the past month. The cryptocurrency rose 42%, compared with a 9% decline in bitcoin over the same period. “There’s been a lot more interest institutionally,” Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto derivatives exchange FTX, said during an interview with Bloomberg. Solana is “one of the only blockchains that has a compelling long-term road map” that will be eventually able to support industrial uses of crypto, he added.

BlockFi CEO Zac Prince, whose interest-bearing crypto account has come under scrutiny in at least five states, and whose company’s fate – repeatedly stayed – remains uncertain, said the lending industry will ultimately need word from the feds.  “We’re not going to decide what box crypto lending belongs in based on what New Jersey does or what Texas does or what any one other state does. It’s gonna come down to federal regulators like the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] or the OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency], creating a path for this type of activity to happen,” he said at SkyBridge Capital’s SALT conference.  The controversy is a fight of definitions. BlockFi has insisted its interest account service is not a security, while the state securities regulators claim otherwise.  Coinbase is staring down a similar morass with the SEC, which has threatened to sue over a crypto lending product it has not yet launched.  Federal fights may yield a more enduring verdict for the U.S. lending industry, according to Prince. “There needs to be clarity at the national level,” he said.  Prince insisted that crypto loans are a service U.S. consumers want, and asserted that the country’s government will not allow it to fall behind.  Mainstream crypto loan services offer customers a 4%-6% yield on their deposits, amounts that trounce most banks’ sub 1% fare. More fringe decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols often promise returns far higher. That’s wowed crypto investors and spooked skeptics.  Prince said these crypto loans are “fundamentally” good for customers and the crypto market too. He said he believes America wants to lead the industry, even if it’s slow to come.  Still, BlockFi’s place in that industry is still being hashed out. New Jersey regulators have repeatedly delayed a “cease and desist” order that would shut down new account onboarding worldwide.  “I think we’re having very productive conversations right now,” said Prince, without speculating on where those conversations might lead.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/13/blockfi-ceo-wants-sec-to-weigh-in-on-crypto-lending,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42421751,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpK7Z,1631560753,How Media Fell for a Lucrative Lie About Walmart,"“A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting its boots on.” – Actually Not Mark Twain  This morning, an unknown scammer perpetrated a news hoax that likely made them a lot of money and cost innocent investors just as much.  A press release posted to the GlobeNewswire service this morning by “Walmart, Inc.” claimed that the big-box retailer would begin accepting payments in the cryptocurrency litecoin (LTC). The news was quickly picked up by reputable news outlets including Reuters, U.S. News & World Report and CoinDesk.  Litecoin, unsurprisingly, surged in the markets, zooming up from $175 to a peak of $233.44 in roughly 15 minutes, according to CoinDesk data. Litecoin trading volumes also surged. Much remains to be unpacked about trading flows during that period, but the likely bottom line is that a lot of people bought LTC on the news.  Then LTC tanked all the way back down to below $180 within another 45 minutes, as some observers began to notice discrepancies in the release. Walmart has now confirmed that it was fake.  Whoever created the fake release likely dumped a large bag of LTC as fast-fingered traders bought the hype. That means a lot of investors just lost a lot of money to a pump-and-dump.  CoinDesk is still working to figure out exactly what happened, but there were at least two key failures. One was at GlobeNewswire, which published a release from a user impersonating WalMart; and one was at the Litecoin Foundation, which retweeted the news on Twitter, seeming to confirm it – despite it containing what we now know were fake quotes from Litecoin Foundation leadership.  Of course, CoinDesk and other news outlets also failed in our due diligence. This was a breakdown in our internal processes, and we are adding further safeguards against getting taken in again.  From the outside, the failure at GlobeNewswire appears to have been the most severe. The service is widely considered a reputable platform for real companies to publish real press releases. The Associated Press, perhaps the most trusted news service in the world, in turn trusts GlobeNewswire enough that it distributes some of its releases automatically.  In this case, though, GlobeNewswire appears to have been duped by a stunningly simple trick. Whoever published the fake release registered a “Walmart, Inc.” account associated with the domain “Walmart-corp.com.”  That sure sounds legit, but the domain is actually owned by a squatter. This was also the first release posted to the account, which should have merited some scrutiny. The release included an email address, william.white@walmart-corp.com, supposedly for real-life Walmart public relations chief William White. But an email sent to that address just before noon Eastern time Monday bounced immediately.  “When GlobeNewswire became aware this morning that a fraudulent user account was used to issue an illegitimate press release we promptly withdrew the press release and issued a Notice to Disregard,” the company said in a statement to CoinDesk. “This has never happened before and we have already put in place enhanced authentication steps to prevent this isolated incident from occurring in the future. We will work with the appropriate authorities to request – and facilitate – a full investigation, including into any criminal activity associated with this matter.”  The pumper is likely to face legal fallout. Even if Walmart stock was not the target, the involvement of a publicly traded company means the SEC is likely to launch an investigation, according to lawyers who spoke to the New York Times. The regulator has repeatedly prosecuted people who try to use fake news to manipulate financial markets.  Another significant failure seems to have been by the Litecoin Foundation, which retweeted the news release early Monday morning from the @Litecoin account. That was reasonably seen by some as confirmation, since Foundation leadership was quoted in the release and would presumably have been involved with preliminary talks with Walmart.  But according to Foundation head and Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, the retweet was a process error.  “We have three people who have access to the [Litecoin] Twitter account,” Lee told CoinDesk. The person on duty “saw the news on GlobeNewswire and got excited. He didn’t know better that we didn’t have a partnership, and unfortunately, he didn’t check with me because I was asleep at the time. So he retweeted it, and 10 minutes later he saw that it was fake and we deleted it.”  “It’s unfortunate,” Lee said. “We’ll definitely be more careful in the future … But I think the story blew up before we tweeted it.”  “It happens. Everyone [in crypto] just reinforces each other,” he said.  That reinforcement will be hard to completely unwind – at this writing, many tweets trumpeting the fake Walmart/litecoin news are still up, and could mislead investors for weeks or even months to come.  This whole mess reflects broader pitfalls of the internet age. False news is more viral than the truth, largely because, freed from the chains of reality, it is usually splashier and more surprising. It also takes much more work to debunk false information that has gained a foothold than it does to create it in the first place.  At the same time, the business imperatives of online media, particularly the financial press, make the entire system more vulnerable to disinformation. Getting a story out quickly can make a huge difference to the traffic and advertising revenue it generates, and over time, to the Google visibility of an entire website. That can lead to corner-cutting as newsrooms race to be first. This time, CoinDesk succumbed to that pressure.

In April, the bank updated the concept based on feedback from Russian banks and other financial markets participants in the country.  The bank was reportedly delaying a decision on launching a digital ruble until after it had tested a prototype, but the ruble’s mention in the Strategy document indicates that the institution is committed to setting a digital currency into motion.  Bank of Russia will start testing the digital ruble in January, the bank’s deputy chairwoman, Olga Skorobogatova, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson. “We’re actively developing the platform at the moment,” Skorobogatova said. “We don’t see any obstacles for launching the digital ruble; however, we will test it in pilot first.”  The pilot will have several phases and help determine a road map for the digital ruble’s launch, and amendments to current regulations, she added.

It is to be given on Tuesday.

A copy of his prepared remarks was released on Monday.  Gensler wrote that while not every crypto token qualified as a security, the fact that platforms have allowed the trading of so many tokens means it is highly likely that at least some securities are being offered on the platforms.  ”Make no mistake: To the extent that there are securities on these trading platforms, under our laws they have to register with the commission unless they qualify for an exemption,” Gensler wrote.  Gensler wrote that as a result, he has suggested that crypto platforms and projects talk to the SEC.  With his latest remarks, Gensler has added to his position that many areas of the crypto industry need more regulation by the SEC.  Gensler added that regarding investor protection, the SEC is working with its sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), with which it has relevant and sometimes overlapping jurisdictions in the crypto markets.  “Currently, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto finance, issuance, trading or lending,” Gensler wrote. “Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West or the old world of ‘buyer beware’ that existed before the securities laws were enacted.”  UPDATE (Sept. 13, 18:50 UTC): Added an additional quote in the sixth bullet point.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nelson Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/13/gensler-says-most-crypto-trading-platforms-need-to-register-with-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cc3a6b09e4c5e0971b8a1694a155145a4aaebf1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

South Korea’s Financial Transaction Reports Act is requiring all crypto exchanges to register with the Financial Services Commission (FSC) by the end of the month. To comply with the country’s anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures, crypto exchanges need to register with local banks and set up real-name accounts for their customers.  Read more: Binance Discontinues South Korean Won Trading Pairs, Payment Options  The FSC has advised exchanges that are unable to meet regulatory obligations must inform their customers of any potential closure by Sept. 17.  Around two-thirds or 40 exchanges out of 60 have yet to register, according to the report, with experts saying it could create a “bank run” scenario. A bank run occurs when the majority of customers attempt to withdraw their money fearing the institution will cease to exist.  In some extreme cases, financial institutions’ reserves have failed to cover the cost of customer withdrawals, and experts are warning the same for smaller crypto exchanges in the country could occur.  “A situation similar to a bank run is expected near the deadline as investors can’t cash out of their holdings of alt-coins listed only on small exchanges,” said Lee Chul-yi, head of medium-sized exchange Foblgate. “They will find themselves suddenly poor. I wonder if regulators can handle the side effects.”  The Financial Times cites industry data and points out that roughly 90% of South Korean crypto trading is conducted in altcoins, some of which are known as “Kimchi coins.” Kimchi coins are tokens primarily developed by Koreans.

Many of the smaller exchanges are unlikely to offer customer protection as they stare down immediate closure, he said.  On Tuesday, Bitfront, a crypto exchange subsidiary of Japanese tech giant LINE, is expected to cease providing a Korean-language service and halt payments with South Korean credit cards as it seeks to appease regulators and cut ties with the country.

42413839,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZWcmk,1631554351,9/11 and the Need for Private Bitcoin,"The Patriot Act was passed 45 days after 9/11. It was the first of many national security laws that expanded the U.S. government’s ability to listen in to the communications of people around the world (including all Americans). In contravention of constitutional rights, presuming guilt rather than innocence, the law turned “regular citizens into suspects,” as the American Civil Liberties Union said.  Two decades later, surveillance has become the norm. Our bodies are scanned with facial recognition, gait detection and a network of an untold number of security cameras. The same is true, and possibly worse, for our online activity. Emails can be monitored, our bank and credit records collected and normal web-surfing watched.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It’s all part of an extrajudicial and anti-democratic infrastructure built in conjunction with the private sector. It was also the impetus for cyberpunks to start building digital tools to reclaim a bit of privacy. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was built with cash in mind. It offers users final settlement and the ability for people who don’t know one another to remain pseudonymous while they interact directly, like handing a bill to a barista, in a digital context.  Read more: The Financial Aftermath of 9/11  But Bitcoin is far from private, and it’s getting less so every day. The growth of blockchain analytics as an industry and the expansion of “know your client” (KYC) guidelines show how crypto is absorbed easily into the surveillance state.  Developers and users must resist this where they can. And, as the cryptocurrency with the greatest chance of establishing itself as a globally accepted monetary standard untethered from governments, bitcoin must lead the way.  Bitcoin has what’s sometimes called functional privacy. Depending on how someone acquires it, uses it and stores it, they could remain a fully pseudonymous entity – a string of alphanumeric gibberish, as far as the blockchain is concerned. Think Satoshi Nakamoto, the fabricated persona behind the Bitcoin network.  This isn’t easy. It requires people to take care at every step of the way of using bitcoin, from buying BTC from non-KYC sources to concealing its blockchain history, rather than treating it as flippantly as cash. Entrepreneur Matt Odell has a useful guide on how to use bitcoin privately.  That’s why it’s key for developers to be thinking about ways to maximize bitcoin privacy. It cannot be left to users (and certainly not exchanges) alone to preserve the cyberpunk ethos of Bitcoin.  The upcoming upgrade Taproot will expand the usability of the Bitcoin network by making it easy to create smart contracts and Lightning channels and hide them as regular transactions. This has positive privacy implications for bitcoin (though it might make things worse in the short term).  Read more: Privacy Concerns Over Bitcoin Upgrade Taproot Are a ‘Non-Issue,’ Experts Say  There are other crypto projects Bitcoin can learn from. There ought to be more discussion of creating natively secret transaction types that blockchains like Monero and Zcash provide. Bitcoin development is slow by intention, every upgrade or technical change comes with tradeoffs, but privacy needs to be part of the roadmap.  Some defend bitcoin from its overblown associations with the criminal underworld by noting that it’s far easier to track digital coins on a blockchain than actual coins.

42421743,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpJyH,1631551952,The Financial Aftermath of 9/11,"9/11 was a human tragedy of staggering proportions.  This weekend America honored and mourned the first responders, office workers, airline passengers and others who lost their lives 20 years ago.  As the world looks back on one of the most consequential events of the 21st century, it’s important to remember 9/11′s long-lasting aftereffects – a reminder that emergencies can make for knee-jerk policy and unforeseen consequences.  These lingering effects include the increased mass surveillance and tightening of anti-money laundering rules under the USA Patriot Act and the toll these measures took on privacy, financial inclusion and innovation.  The added compliance burden raised the barriers to entry in financial services, further discouraging competition and strengthening incumbents with scale to offset the costs.  Meanwhile, as Shoshanna Zuboff argues in her book “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,” the national security establishment’s thirst for ever-more private data dovetailed with Silicon Valley’s desire to mine it for profit.  Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and the Web3 movement can all to varying degrees be seen as reactions to these historical forces that undermined the liberating promise of the early internet.

For a project that&apos;s been on the market for less than two weeks, Bored Ape Yacht Club Tron is capturing quite the attention in the NFT space. This collection of 10,000 unique Bored Apes supported by Palmar Labs has launched today its own marketplace, only second to the already broadly popular Tpunks. Aligned with the project&apos;s roadmap, this marketplace was designed to be an easy-to-use tool developed for the minters of the collection to access a &apos;potentially profitable&apos; secondary market. Tpunks, a homage to the Ethereum-based CryptoPunks, has even captured the attention of Tron founder Justin Sun, who pocketed a Joker Tpunk for $10.5 million. The marketplace has multiple filters that enable enthusiasts to sort the collection and quickly find their pieces of interest. Aside from filters such as background, clothes, and mouth shape, Bored Ape lovers can navigate the eye-catching selection by entering a precise ID number. This is a simple, yet powerful tool since many NFT collectors tend to compare the serial numbers across projects in search of super rare art pieces.

42421742,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpJt7,1631546365,How DeFi Can Help Make Climate Change an Investable Asset,"Fixing our planet is going to cost a lot of money. It’s not hard to find projections of those costs that run into the trillions of dollars. A quick literature survey turned up estimates of $4.5 trillion to decarbonize the U.S. electric grid, another $3 trillion for climate change mitigation, just in the U.S. over the next decade, and about $4 trillion needed to redress systematic inequalities in our education system. That is starting to sound like a lot of money, even for the $23 trillion U.S. economy, although the amount is still less than the cost of replacing our planet or moving to a new one.  Historically, the U.S. invests about 17% to 20% of its gross domestic product, which amounts today to around $5 trillion annually. Addressing some of the world’s biggest environmental and social challenges over the next decade would require the U.S. to increase that investment closer to 22% to 24%, adding another $1 trillion annually. While very recent history suggests a renewed appetite for investment in the U.S., especially led by the government, another $10 trillion might be too large for most politicians and voters to embrace.  Paul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist. Join me and CoinDesk’s Michael Casey on September 14 online and live in New York for a discussion about the future of DeFi and ESG.  The good news is that there is no shortage of capital. In the U.S., the widest measure of money velocity (MZM), published by the Federal Reserve, shows that money is changing hands at the slowest rate since records have been kept. Money is moving slowly partly due to concerns about the economy but also because of a sense that asset prices are high and there is a lack of good investment opportunities. The cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500, a good measure of how richly valued assets are, is currently higher than at any time in recorded history except for the third quarter of 1999. As a result, lots of capital is sitting on the sidelines looking for sustainable returns.  In theory, there should be a good match between the $10 trillion in investment needed to transform our society and all that idle capital. In practice, there’s disagreement about the potential for return on investment and the opportunity to capture it. If you listen to the optimists, the ROI on social and ecological transformation is actually pretty good – with typical internal rates of return (IRR) of 6% on college educations, between 4% to 7% on utility-scale solar investments and between 7%to 10% on climate change adaptations.  In practice, the obstacles to capturing those returns are high. Adaptation to climate change is a good example. Investments in prevention or mitigation might lead to much reduced damage from climate change, but who benefits? Without a mechanism to identify the opportunity or capture it, the opportunity for return doesn’t really exist. There are similar challenges for educational investments or renewable energy.  Investments in renewable energy are gathering pace, and they show both the potential and the pitfalls of investing in social good. One bottleneck is the ability to spot good investment opportunities for utility-scale solar or wind investments, to align with local governments on incentives and regulatory challenges, and then to find patient investors with a tolerance for some risk.  All of these different investing strategies are possible and are occurring with increasing frequency, but there are multiple bottlenecks along the way. The biggest gap is the expertise required to identify opportunities that fit with regulatory compliance issues and patient investors. This is a highly specialized and localized skill that takes years to develop. Even then, once an opportunity is developed and matched, it can take years to complete and exit before freeing up capital for new opportunities.  Legacy industries such as oil and gas, traditional college loans or disaster insurance, have a century or more of maturing behind them. They have mountains of data to compare risks and how to mitigate them. Even if the returns are weak, the friction involved in getting them to market is low and there is a large pool of experienced investors who are comfortable with and understand the risks.  Three ways  Across the board, this same infrastructure is missing or underdeveloped for many critical social investments. Blockchain technology offers some hope for accelerating this path forward in three different ways.  The first is around new methods for tracking, managing and capturing returns. The logic in smart contracts allows companies to do things that were not easy to do at scale in the past – such as tracking carbon emissions from a single enterprise and matching those with offset activities and verifying that there’s no double-counting.  Using blockchain technology and smart contracts, complete with oracles and external auditors, makes it possible to look at the total life cycle of a product, to attach carbon outputs to asset tokens along the process and bring products to market that have a verifiable net-zero carbon footprint. Hundreds of companies have pledged a path to net-zero carbon emissions and this will offer them a provable mechanism for getting there.  Second, blockchains allow us to segment assets in ways that were not possible or simple in the past. Mortgage-backed securities allowed investors to buy slices of risk in a pool of securities, but in practice, the assessment of risk was subjective. With a blockchain-based smart contract, you can separately tokenize a renewable energy investment as a vanilla energy-producing asset and a carbon-offset investment, offering one to a low-risk utility investor and the other to a company that has pledged 100% carbon offsets, with data flows and smart contracts verifying outputs and distributing returns. Unlike past securitization efforts, this one can be underpinned with real-time systems data and transparent business logic on-chain.  Third, blockchain investors have something else corporations need to fund the path to a better world: a high tolerance for risk. Bloomberg estimates that $500 billion was poured into renewables in 2020. Not only is that not enough, but it also didn’t get that big overnight. It took years to build the skills and investment opportunities to attract that much capital. The early days were much riskier. If we want to accelerate the path forward on education opportunities or climate change, we need more risk-tolerant investors putting capital into the hands of portfolio managers who will need to learn and get better at spotting investments.  The early days will be rough as the ecosystem works through challenges from investment skills to external data validation, to the right way to construct smart contracts and how to package all the pieces to suit investors. The faster we get risk-tolerant capital into the mix, the faster we start flattening that learning curve.  I count myself among the optimists who believe there is enormous ROI to be had in making our world a more sustainable, fairer place. It’s not a question of if or why, just a question of how soon, and will that be soon enough.

Flatter will combine NFTs with “exclusive experiences,” “sought-after collectibles” and philanthropy, according to a statement shared with CoinDesk. The offerings will be “separate” from the hedge fund’s alternative investment funds.  The first bundle to be sold on Flatter will be 140 bottles of “rare whiskey” decorated with a portrait of Scaramucci that was designed by French artist 8th Project and signed by the hedge fund executive and the artist. The bottles will come with tickets to next year’s SALT conference and a dinner with 8th Project. Some proceeds will go to the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.  SALT is a star-studded hedge fund conference founded by Scaramucci in 2009. It is usually held in Las Vegas, but was moved to New York this year due to COVID-19. Organizers expect 2,300 attendees. This year’s SALT lineup includes FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, Paris Hilton and H.R. McMaster, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former Trump administration national security advisor.  The whiskey bottles will be sold in three blocks; the first priced at 1 ETH, the second at 1.25 ETH and the third at 1.5 ETH. Buyers can pay with U.S. dollars.  The second offering will be five NFT lifetime SALT tickets and access to the SkyBridge executive. The NFT owners will have lifetime access and VIP treatment to all SALT conferences, including two tickets to a wine party, and coffee with Scarmucci at the conference. They will also get one “power breakfast” with Scaramucci and invites to other SkyBridge events.  The SALT NFTs feature the conference’s logo on a salt shaker.

The project launched Aug. 31 and currently holds $2.23 billion in assets in various DeFi projects, up from $238 million on Friday, according to L2Beat, an analytics platform for Layer 2 protocols. For comparison, the rival layer 2 solution dYdX has $329 million locked, while Optimism, another closely tracked project, has $155 million. Polygon, which isn’t tracked by L2Beat, has $4.7 billion locked, according to Defi Llama.  Layer 2 solutions, which work in a similar way to plug-ins to help speed transaction throughput on bigger blockchains, have drawn increasing interest from digital-asset investors this year. This is partly due to congestion on Ethereum, where a frenzy of activity in the fast-growing realm of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, has driven up the cost of fees to levels some users consider exorbitant.  Polygon’s MATIC token has been one of the hottest in all of cryptocurrency markets this year, increasing 69-fold in price to a market capitalization of $8.3 billion. Arbitrum doesn’t have its own token.  Arbitrum can process transactions at lower cost than Ethereum by handling them on a “sidechain” that uses a technology called “optimistic rollups.” Transactions on these sidechains are then settled in batches on the main Ethereum blockchain.  The number of unique addresses on Arbitrum has also seen an impressive three-fold rise to 70,000 since Friday, while the network’s daily transaction volume has surged above $250,000 in just ten days.  According to the crypto-markets data website CoinGecko, ArbiNYAN is the most significant contributor to Arbitrum-based DeFi projects, with nearly $1.5 billion in assets. Launched just Thursday, ArbiNYAN is a meme-token project designed to bring liquidity and users to Arbitrum. Since the launch, the token has witnessed intense volatility, rising from 0.3 cents to as high as $7 before falling to $1 at press time.  While Arbitrum tops the list of largest layer 2 networks in terms of DeFi collateral locked, it is the seventh-largest project overall for DeFi, just ahead of Fantom and just behind Avalanche, per Defi Llama. Ethereum retains a dominant position, with more than $118 billion in assets, versus $16 billion for second-place Binance Smart Chain followed by $11.3 billion for Solana.",POSITIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | ARB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/13/arbitrum-vaults-onto-layer-2-leaderboard-as-defi-assets-cross-2-billion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99ee9954dd22631e265f9896e9fbf252fe054622-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance coin price analysis: General price overview Bollinger band is wide on the daily Binance coin price analysis, indicating the coin is highly volatile despite trading a bearish trend. The coin has been trading in a range of intraday lows of $389 and the highest of the day, $420. This should make investors be keen enough as one can lose his money or record high gains.

42412060,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otcaPN,1631528457,"Bitcoin Eyes US Inflation Report, Potential Dollar Liquidity Squeeze","Bitcoin’s immediate bullish trajectory has weakened following the last week’s double-digit price drop. The cryptocurrency’s near-term prospects hinge on Tuesday’s U.S. inflation report.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is trading 3% lower on the day at $44,500, having dropped 11% last week. That was the biggest single-week percentage decline since May.  According to Coinbase Institutional, bitcoin’s immediate bullish outlook has weakened, courtesy of last week’s slide, and the cryptocurrency could consolidate between $44,000 and $48,000 for the time being.  Some chart experts fear a deeper drop as the price structure now looks similar to the one observed after bitcoin’s double-digit slide in the second half of April.  An extended sell-off could materialize if the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) figure for August, scheduled for release at 18:00 UTC on Tuesday, prints above 5% annualized. That could speed up the Federal Reserve’s plans to begin scaling back its liquidity-boosting asset purchases.  Bitcoin’s mid-May slide from $58,000 to $30,000 happened after official data released on May 12 showed the U.S. CPI at a three-year high and triggered taper fears. The sell-off also coincided with China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies and concerns regarding the negative environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining.  “Inflation remains the key as usual – specifically when base effects will end & CPI prints begin to reflect the true year-on-year picture for the Fed,” QCP Capital said in its Telegram channel. “Arguably, the worst of the base effects have now run its course [as seen in the chart below]. If inflation still remains above 5% from here, the hawks will surely start expressing worry.”  Several Fed members have already turned hawkish, signaling a willingness to begin scaling back asset purchases, or tapering, this year. Some observers are concerned that a possible taper would lead to a substantial drop in the dollar liquidity in the fourth quarter, and could coincide with the U.S. Treasury issuing more bonds to rebuild its coffers (the Treasury General Account, or TGA) after the debt ceiling is lifted.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. government could run out of cash and hit the debt ceiling between mid-October and mid-November. The Fed is expected to begin tapering around the same time.  “The U.S. Treasury will likely quickly rebuild the cash balance after a debt ceiling suspension as the new ‘equilibrium level’ of the TGA seems to be around USD 800bn. This is a net liquidity withdrawal of almost USD 600bn compared to the current scenario, which cannot be seen as good news for risk appetite,” analysts at Nordea Bank said in the weekly research note published on Friday.  Bitcoin and other traditional market risk assets have soared in the past 18 months, thanks to the liquidity deluge brought on by the Fed’s stimulus program, and so a liquidity squeeze due to a Fed taper and U.S. Treasury actions could weigh on asset prices in general, and especially on bitcoin because capital in crypto markets is mercenary and tends to overreact, according to Messari’s Mira Christanto.  Top investment banks foresee market risk aversion strengthening in the weeks ahead. According to the Australian Finance Review, Morgan Stanley expects U.S. stocks to decline by as much as 15% by year’s end, while Bank of America foresees a 6% drop.  A stock-market decline could add to bearish pressures around bitcoin. “The world still sees bitcoin as a risk-on asset,” Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, tweeted. “Almost every bitcoin correction in 2021 has correlated with an S&P500 correction of -2% or more.” The S&P 500 fell by 1.69% last week alongside bitcoin’s 11% decline.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/13/bitcoin-eyes-us-inflation-report-potential-dollar-liquidity-squeeze,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/554442fc51ca20e2481f6b1919951091ebe4c47c-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Etherscan said the hashrate was 715.4 terahash/second on Sunday, while OKLink showed it was 677.9 TH/s. Both platforms said those are record values.  The hashrate has been on an upward trajectory since the end of June. Prior to the incline that led to today’s level, the all-time high was on May 19, when Etherscan recorded 632.8 TH/s and OKLink 604.5 TH/s.  Chinese cities and provinces have been cracking down on crypto mining since a May 21 statement from the State Council. As miners powered off their rigs and tried to move their operations abroad, hashrates for both ethereum and bitcoin fell. Many of these miners are now operational again.  Eddie Wang, a senior researcher at OKLink, also attributed the increase to a change in miners’ expectations. Miners and analysts expected Ethereum’s London hard fork, which was implemented on Aug. 5, to cause a fall in miner revenue, Wang told CoinDesk via WeChat.  But high demand on the network, with minting of non-fungible tokens that carry high priority fees, has kept miners’ revenue up, Wang said.  Because mining has proven profitable after the hard fork, more miners are coming online, Wang said.

X-Margin also has the backing of such trading firms as CMS Holdings, Dunamis Trading, Kronos Research, MGNR, Pirata Capital and Wintermute Trading.  Cryptocurrency lending is big business, but in order to get loans, traders have to over-collateralize (typically, for every dollar of bitcoin they borrow, they have to post $1.20 as collateral for the safety of the loan). The result is that borrowers are suffering because they can’t get cheap loans, while lenders are at risk because they lack visibility.

Decentralized applications are powered by smart contracts to drive the exchange of value across participants instead of having a middle party functioning as a central validator to enforce the terms of a contract and ensure compliance. Blockchain technology and the advent of smart contracts have replaced the central validator with decentralized architecture where all contracts are enforced automatically. What this does is bring operational efficiencies, reducing counterparty risks, and cutting down on costs. As a result, the emerging technology has been unique, and its applications across finance, the supply chain, marketing, logistics, and the manufacturing industries have been enormous. Industries are technically and creatively dependent on data to connect blockchain and external data resources to drive their operations. Phoenix Global is meant to eliminate this lack of connectivity and serve as a middleware oracle retrieving data from external data feeds into blockchains. The oracle is two-way, which means it can feed the real world with data from blockchains and vice versa. The platform has a robust security framework that protects it from a single point of failure, downtime, data manipulation, and supporting multi-layered smart contracts where particular DeFi components can be stored off-chain.

42412044,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otcZNk,1631504861,Former Ripple Execs to Launch Micropayments Platform to Tackle Transaction Fees,"Two former executives from global payments company Ripple are planning to launch a micropayments network next year.  The startup, which has moved out of stealth mode, aims to give customers the ability to conduct low-value payments ($20 or less) by significantly reducing fees associated with such transactions.  Jeremy Light, former vice president of strategic accounts at Ripple, and Richard Bell, a former senior director at the payments network, founded pingNpay on the belief the network will be a good fit for Web 3.0 infrastructure and ecosystems.  “No one has yet to crack the sub-$20 digital payment market,” Bell said. “The major card networks can process tens of thousands of payments per second, but even so, the cheapest debit card payments cost retailers at least 20p (US$0.33) per payment, which represents 20% of a £1 (US$ 1.38) payment.”  Customers will be able to pay for services and products offline, including food and beverages, while also being able to pay for online products, including subscriptions, according to a press release on Sunday.  Specifically, pingNpay will cap transaction fees at 1% of the assessed value of each transaction. The fees will be distributed among software providers for digital wallets as well as wallet providers that issue the wallets to users.  Fees will be paid in real time at point of transaction and will be borne by the payer unless it’s a consumer-to-business transactions, in which case the receiver pays, according to the release.  According to the startup’s website, pingNpay is targeting the fourth quarter of this year to have its core technology “up and running” with plans to launch first in the U.K. by 2022. It will use a stablecoin backed by the British pound. Other countries are expected to follow in “quick succession,” with their own local currency-pegged stablecoins.  The stablecoins to follow in each country of operation will be “100% backed” by liquid fiat assets and will feature a published proof of reserve to meet regulatory requirements, the company said.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/13/former-ripple-execs-to-launch-micropayments-platform-to-tackle-transaction-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb816131932fe9ac3b9a3eb0886035fed0827b34-1440x480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
