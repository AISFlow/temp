Last May, Buterin donated 50 trillion in SHIB tokens (worth about $1.2 billion at that time), which the creators of shiba inu sent him unsolicited, to the CryptoRelief fund. He burned the rest of the tokens.  Buterin tweeted that he will use the $100 million “to complement CryptoRelief’s existing excellent work with some higher-risk higher-reward covid science and relief projects worldwide.”  The move comes as the Indian government is gearing up to present the nation’s budget on Feb. 1. The country’s lawmakers have been weighing new crypto regulations.  Nailwal hinted that the country’s crypto wariness figured in the decision to return the amount in stablecoin to Buterin.  “Considering the fund's foreign origin and laws of India, Crypto Relief followed a systematic, controlled & robust approach in disbursing funds mandated to be utilized for India,” tweeted Nailwal. “But being an Indian citizen (NRI), I have to be extra cautious in any of the projects being donated to,” he added.",POSITIVE,SHIB | USDC,ETH | SHIB | USDC,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/28/buterin-to-use-returned-100m-from-shib-donation-for-covid-projects-worldwide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a064852e327edc378a208d7eba158b433a27bd91-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It has so far lost over 60% of its all-time high, putting the majority of its investors right in the loss territory. The downtrend has been a cause for alarm among holders. But it looks like not everyone feels that way as some, mostly whales, have taken this as an opportunity to increase their holdings. Whales Fill Up On ADA A report from analysis firm Santiment shows a broad accumulation trend among whales when it comes to ADA. As the price of the digital asset had crumbled, big investors had ramped up their buying activity.

Cold storage is a way of holding cryptocurrency tokens offline rather than on an internet-connected exchange.  Todaro sees Arculus becoming one of the top three largest crypto hardware wallet providers by the end of this year, and expects continued material revenue growth from this segment throughout 2023.  CompoSecure could sell 160,000 Arculus units this year and 840,000 units in 2023, Todaro estimated. While Ledger and Trezor will sell more wallets over those years thanks to customer “stickiness,” Todaro thinks the speediest growth will be in Arculus.  Todaro and team see continued growth in private custody, expecting a 6.4% three-year compounded growth rate for bitcoin (BTC) addresses, and a 32.4% growth rate for Ethereum-based addresses.  Todaro initiated CompoSecure with a buy rating and $14 price target, suggesting more than 80% upside from current levels. Shares are down about 7% so far in 2022.

42375402,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7dfz,1643406576,Terra's LUNA Dumps After Wonderland Controversy,"LUNA, the native token of the Terra ecosystem, is suffering the effects of negative sentiment after Thursday’s Wonderland drama.  The token, which backs Terra's algorithmic UST stablecoin, was down over 17% on Friday morning, according to data from CoinMarketCap. It traded as low as $47.56, the lowest price since November. Recently, LUNA was changing hands at $51.89, down from its all-time high of $100.17 in December.  The price drop comes a day after pseudonymous Twitter user “Zach” exposed a core member of the Wonderland project to be Michael Patryn, the co-founder of the infamous Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX.  The effects of that revelation made its way to the markets relating to another project also run by Wonderland founder Daniele Sestagalli, Abracadabra. The kerfuffle is affecting Terra because UST can be staked to lend out MIM, a stablecoin that is soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar and minted by the Abracadabra lending platform. The price of LUNA is tied to the total value locked of the UST stablecoin.  Canada-based QuadrigaCX, thought to be a Ponzi scheme, famously collapsed in 2019 after its main founder, Gerald Cotten, was said to have died in India. Patryn and the remaining partner claim they lost access to C$115 million in customer funds. That wasn’t the only controversy surrounding Patryn; he also pleaded guilty to credit and bank fraud in 2005 and admitted to burglary, theft and computer fraud in 2007.  However, Sestagalli seems to be uninterested in the past, posting a message Thursday, “I am of the opinion of giving second chances.”  In response to the drama and Sestagalli’s handling of the situation, TIME, the native Wonderland token, dropped 32%.  Similarly, MIM slipped off its dollar peg in a sharp drop, trading at $0.93 during Thursday afternoon trading hours. The coin rebounded quickly and was recently at $0.98.

The bill, SB 1341, was introduced by state Sen. Wendy Rogers, a Republican. It seeks to amend the list of accepted legal tender to include bitcoin, which means the cryptocurrency would be accepted for the payment of debt, public charges, taxes and other dues.  Whether such a law could go into effect is questionable, given that the U.S. Constitution doesn't allow individual states to create their own legal tender.  The bill must pass the Arizona state senate and house before Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, could sign it into law.  Rogers, who took office in early 2021, is a controversial figure who has ties to the anti-government group Oath Keepers and who praised conspiracy theory group QAnon.  Don Huffines, a Republican real estate developer and current candidate for Texas governor, recently said he would make bitcoin tender if he’s elected.

Meanwhile, some alternative cryptocurrencies began to stabilize after a volatile week.  Analysts were also looking for signs of a possible bounce in equity markets, which could encourage crypto buying. So far, some traders appear to be on the sidelines in both traditional and crypto markets. The S&P 500 is roughly flat over the past week, compared with a 1% gain in BTC and a 3% drop in ETH over the same period.  ""Investors continue to withdraw from U.S. stocks amid the expected tightening of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  If selling continues, more investors could start to reduce their positions on risky assets, and cryptocurrencies may be hit first, according to Kuptsikevich. That means a short-term price bounce could be limited.  Further, given macroeconomic headwinds, some analysts are concerned about a coming ""crypto winter,"" similar to what occurred in 2017-2018. But it appears that winter is already here, especially given the nearly 40% drop in BTC from its all-time high of close to $69,000 in November.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $37696, +5.55%    ●Ether (ETH): $2517, +7.51%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4432, +2.43%    ●Gold: $1790 per troy ounce, −0.17%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.78%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Systemic risk in crypto markets?  The recent underperformance in some altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens indicates heightened risk in crypto markets. And when uncertainty is high, some traders tend to rotate into bitcoin, which is deemed to be less risky in the crypto market.  The CoinDesk markets team has covered the sharp sell-offs across various tokens over the past two weeks, which could keep some crypto buyers on the sidelines. Here is a rundown of risks we identified.  Tokens related to Wonderland developer plunged:  In the past 24 hours, Popsicle Finance’s ICE fell as much as 22%, Wonderland’s TIME fell 15%, and Abracadabra’s SPELL dropped 15%. These are tokens created by Daniele Sestagalli, who gained a cult following in recent months thanks to his community-centric approach toward crypto projects. His protocols were worth billions of dollars at their peak, but those fortunes have since faded away, CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa reported.  A falling out between two startup projects on Cardano:  On Wednesday, CoinDesk's Lyllah Ledesma wrote about the SundaeSwap debacle that left CardStarter users with steep losses. The conflict is between CardStarter, which describes itself as a ""decentralized accelerator"" for startup projects focused on Cardano, and SundaeSwap, a decentralized exchange built on the Cardano platform.  And then, there's potential contagion risk in Terra's UST stablecoin:  LUNA, Terra’s native token, was down as much as 10% during the past 24 hours due to yet another scandal. LUNA is on Abracadabra, a DeFi lending platform run by Sestagalli. LUNA was partly created for issuing stablecoins. The reserves of Terra-based lending and borrowing protocol Anchor, which offers a supposedly industry-beating benchmark deposit rate of around 20%, are also sliding fast as a result of the crypto market crash.

Some observers following the asset peg saga are worried UST and MIM could serve as a “contagion” that destabilizes other pools on Curve, CoinDesk's Andrew Thurman reported.  Altcoin roundup  Sandbox (SAND) Announces $50,000,000 accelerator fund: Popular gaming crypto The Sandbox (SAND) is partnering with a global venture company to open a fund for developing metaverse startups. According to a news release, SAND has committed $50 million to Hong Kong-based accelerator company Brinc for The Sandbox Metaverse Accelerator Program, which will invest $250,000 in 100 new metaverse altcoins.

ChainLink Capital targets $100M in assets for two crypto funds: Crypto-focused venture capital fund ChainLink Capital Management has set a target to reach $100 million of assets under management each for its Luna and Ama funds this year, general partner Andrew Hoppin told CoinDesk in an interview. The funds had about $30 million and $13 million under management, respectively, at the end of last year. Read more here.

While tech and cloud giants such as Google and Amazon represent the heights of Web 2 centralization, Google is seeing the opportunity presented by newer decentralized blockchain technologies. CNBC was the first to write about the hiring move.  Heading up strategy for the new group is Rich Widmann, who previously worked in the legal department of Google as product counsel. Widmann tweeted on Thursday about his move.  Google’s cloud service currently offers tools that developers can use to build blockchain networks, and also counts blockchain firms, such as Dapper Labs, Hedera, Thera Labs and several crypto exchanges, as customers. And Google Cloud also underwent an integration with Polygon to allow developers to more easily analyze on-chain data on the blockchain.  Among the services Google Cloud plans to offer are providing dedicated node hosting to developers, participating in node validation and on-chain governance with partners, and helping developers and users host their nodes on what it claims is the industry’s cleanest cloud.  Google declined to comment on how large the new team would be.  Amazon AWS, the leader in the cloud computing space, has become active in blockchain technology, particularly having to do with financial and payment applications.

42407258,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUOkk3,1643402387,A Look at EU's GDPR and What It Means for Crypto Privacy,"Given the stupendous amount of personal information stored and transferred online, it's good that regulators are moving to bolster consumer privacy. But these rules – ranging from the ""right to be forgotten"" to the ability query a database to see what information they keep about you on file – may bump up against the web the blockchain industry is building, sometimes called Web 3.  Crypto's primary benefits stem from being open, transparent and immutable. Blockchain-based web apps are necessarily different than the multibillion-dollar ""walled gardens"" that dominant the internet today. Privacy laws were written with the old web in mind, the web of Facebook and Google.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  It's an open question whether blockchain can develop in a way to meet the requirements of contemporary digital privacy laws while still preserving the attributes that make it successful. This is especially true for the most significant data legislation on the books today, the European Union’s ""General Data Protection Regulation"" (GDPR).  See also: Europe's Hidden Agenda on Crypto Wallets | The Node  Europe’s GDPR: An overview  GDPR is the grandmaster of privacy frameworks. It governs how individuals’ personal data can be used across tech and other industry sectors within the EU’s jurisdiction. It covers all businesses that maintain records of users, regardless of whether or not they’re based in the EU.  In effect, GDPR means that companies cannot act wantonly or reckless with private, personal information ranging from someone’s Google search history to a Twitter user’s social graph.  This policy towards personal data is sometimes called privacy “by design” or “by default,” and applies to both software and hardware. It has major implications for blockchains that are, generally speaking, publicly auditable protocols.  According to GDPR rules, blockchains should be “privacy-preserving by design,” meaning developers must consider user privacy while designing and developing crypto platforms, as well as crypto-based products and services.  The immutability and broad availability of data on public and permissionless blockchains is an obvious challenge for developers. It’s a balancing act between ensuring users only provide as much personal data as actually needed to get the job done and the core tenets of this novel technology.  “After all, blockchains do not forget,” Michael Kunz, senior legal associate at MME, a Swiss law firm specialized in crypto and fintech, said during our after-hours chat. “So it is essential that developers get it right from the get-go.”  Crypto founders can benefit from a close look at GDPR’s existing policies regarding users’ personal data.  GDPR Section 3 Articles 16-17: Right to Data Rectification and Erasure  Article 17 of GDPR outlines the circumstances under which an individual has the right to have their personal data erased. Similarly, Article 16 gives users the right to rectify incorrect personal data within any organization’s database by providing a supplementary statement. While an individual’s ability to alter or erase data is conditional, that person's legal ability to do so at all clashes with blockchain’s core tenant of data immutability.  Crypto projects can find solutions to existing data rectification and erasure requirements by, for instance, storing users’ sensitive data off-chain and using cryptographic systems for on-chain verification to ensure data authenticity.  Decentralized networks don’t necessarily need to be data operators, similarly to how decentralized exchanges (DEX) might not be classified as financial intermediaries. However, by definition, system decentralization needs to be agreed upon. One might certainly hope that in the future a precise legal framework will be introduced that takes into account users having full control over their data and sharing them directly with third parties, knowing exactly what the data is being used for and why  GDPR Article 15: Right of access  In addition to a data subject’s explicit rights to access and erase his or her data, GDPR’s Article 15 also requires organizations to abide by the principles of data protection and privacy. As a result, businesses must operate in a way that minimizes extraneous data collection and ensure user privacy is a foundational consideration, rather than as an afterthought.  This may present issues for public blockchains that allow anyone to anonymously access information stored on its ledger without any limits to how often they do so, or records of when, where and by whom this information was accessed.  Enter actual privacy on a blockchain. Whenever discussing regulatory compliance, we ought to differentiate between transparency of the process and transparency of the data included in that process.  Zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation are technical solutions to this problem. As they are deployed today, zk-proofs and MPC offer ways to keep data recognizable and verifiable on-chain, without being explicitly tied to an identity.  Adam Gagol, chief technology officer for the enterprise-grade and privacy-preserving blockchain Aleph Zero, thinks these tools would effectively address most regulatory concerns about unrestricted data access.  See also: Privacy Laws Are Only as Effective as the Companies Implementing Them  GDPR Chapter 4: Data controllers and processors  Blockchain’s distributed nature makes it essentially impossible to identify a specific “data controller.” It is difficult to envision a world in which regulations permit fully decentralized organizations to operate freely without the ability to hold a legal entity responsible for what happens on the network. At the same time, even if decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) register as legal entities it is unlikely that every project will be able to identify a legal party that can be held accountable for each and every infraction that occurs on their network.  As a result, there isn’t a simple solution to GDPR’s need for an accountable party. Crypto projects concerned about potential legal liabilities on this front might be better off mitigating their overall risk by enacting stricter KYC/AML (know-your-customer and anti-money laundering) policies to curtail malicious user behavior that may implicate the entire network.  So how might fully decentralized systems remain compliant while still benefiting from a network’s public nature? I’ve had a sit-down with Pawel Kuskowski, former global head of AML at the Royal Bank of Scotland and a founder of Gatenox, which offers a decentralized identifier (DID) system built on top of the Aleph Zero network. Here’s what he thinks: “The key is to clearly separate the responsibilities of creators and operators of a given blockchain and smart contracts developers, self-governed identity providers, as well as users of these solutions.”  This will become all the more important given the exponential growth of crypto markets. The question is whether crypto developers and organizations like DAOs will see the ethical mandate to comply with regulations.  Proactively protecting users  The above is just an overview of a few challenges the blockchain sector faces, especially those concerned about privacy. A deeper exploration should entail a discussion involving specific policy frameworks and user applications. Although I cannot offer specific predictions for the future, I believe regulators will eventually draft relatively permissive laws that allow for responsible data sharing and growth, rather than treating the entire industry as an undesirable, privacy-violating monolith.  Rather than waiting to see what regulators decide, it’s up to crypto founders to proactively protect their users’ personal data while ensuring full online accountability. In other words, we should not shy away from balanced, well-intentioned privacy regulations – either now or in the future.

42394317,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbWVJ,1643402358,6 Reasons for Optimism This Crypto Winter,"When token markets plunged in 2018 following the initial coin offering (ICO) bubble, I wrote a column entitled “Crypto Winter Is Here and We Only Have Ourselves to Blame.” It lamented the get-rich-quick schemes and “lambos” that took precedence over the development of real solutions to real problems at that time.  Four years later, with crypto markets reeling from another sharp sell-off, I feel no compulsion to write such a self-flagellating piece on the industry’s behalf.  Sure, last year’s boom generated overblown prices for many tokens, both fungible and non-fungible, alongside a whole new set of bad-taste, wealth-flashing memes. (The phrase “have fun staying poor” surely took the prize as the worst.)  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But in many ways the building and problem solving that followed the 2018 meltdown has served us well. It meant the speculation behind the most recent boom was built on a more established foundation than in 2017.  Crypto is still far from going mainstream, both in terms of its technical capability and social acceptance. But there is a lot less “vaporware” now. It feels more “real,” established, here to stay – that it truly is building something transformative for the world. That’s why this “winter” feels less brutal.  So, with that in mind, here are my six main reasons to say “this time is different” (which, I know, is always a dangerous thing to say).  Layer 2 scaling systems: No longer just an idea  Whether it’s the Lightning Network for low-cost bitcoin payments, the ZK-rollups that power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or multiparty computation projects enabling secure online custody, cryptographic advances have over the past three years gone from concept to deployment.These innovations will lead to the network processing scalability that’s needed for blockchain technology to go mainstream.  Most of these are layer 2 or companion tools that address a core problem with multi-node blockchains: the need for a massive amount of duplicative computation to process transactions on chain. They represent decentralized alternatives to “permissioned” blockchains where only a small set of approved actors would have the authority to validate transactions (thus improving efficiency). Instead, Layer 2 mechanisms use clever cryptography to enable off-chain computation that can’t be gamed and which, after linking outcomes back to a “permissionless” blockchain, don’t undermine its decentralized consensus. If Ethereum developers can successfully migrate that blockchain to the full suite of 2.0 features, even bigger scaling gains will soon be made by the crypto ecosystem.  Permissionless models are winning  Thanks partly to the technological improvements described above, recent crypto success stories are concentrated among permissionless projects open to any participants, rather than in the permissioned projects once favored by incumbent players. The money is being made in DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), not so much in IBM’s once prominent “enterprise blockchain” offerings.  Users are finding value in blockchain technology’s most disruptive, paradigm-changing promises rather than in incremental adjustments to existing business models. This reflects hope that it will unleash a truly transformative wave of innovation, something closer to what the internet achieved than most fintech ideas seem geared toward.  Corporates and financial institutions are here now  This preference for permissionless crypto projects is not just coming from crypto-native “degens.” It’s also found among the same kinds of established companies that were earlier the target of permissioned enterprise blockchain ideas. Thousands of mainstream firms are experimenting with NFTs and social tokens, especially those in entertainment, fashion and media such Adidas, Warner Brothers and The New York Tiimes. One mark of what this says about the sector’s future growth came in separate earnings calls this week, when Satya Nadella and Tim Cook, the CEOs of Microsoft and Apple, respectively, both crowed over opportunities in the metaverse and pledged to invest forcefully in it.  Meanwhile, even though lots of institutional investors have no doubt pared down their bitcoin positions these past couple of weeks, the engagement in crypto among hedge funds, family offices and even pension funds surged last year – with the more adventurous of them dabbling in DeFi. Even if they’ve sold a lot of crypto of late, institutions’ investments in the technology, staff, processes and legal arrangements needed to enable those investments now stand as a base of established infrastructure for handling future transactions. The institutions aren’t leaving.  Regulation implies normalization  While the crypto community was understandably upset by some poorly worded amendments to a U.S. infrastructure bill that resulted in overzealous tax surveillance of crypto service providers, the law also effectively legitimized the industry. If a government wants to tax a sector, it won’t kill it. It was also encouraging to see wide bipartisan support for the (ultimately failed) efforts to soften those amendments, along with other signs that lawmakers are becoming better informed.  Regulation remains a barrier to innovation, adoption and growth, particularly the onerous nature of anti-money laundering rules and securities law enforcement. But it’s also a framework for normalizing the industry and for making the general public feel more comfortable with it.  Read more: Is a Crypto Winter Coming? 3 Things to Consider  This wasn’t (all) crypto’s fault  The mad 2017 token price runup and subsequent collapse in 2018 was largely endemic to the crypto sector. It was stoked by investor mania for ICOs and by blind belief in the untested ideas of founders who raised billions of dollars on flimsy white papers. The inflated prices for this vaporware inevitably deflated when doubts about their promises grew.  The current situation is quite different. While excessive enthusiasm for new tokens contributed to unsustainable price rallies, crypto’s ballooning market capitalization was also fueled by unprecedented fiat monetary expansion as central banks pumped trillions of dollars worth of quantitative easing into the global economy to soften the impact of a pandemic-fueled global recession. That surfeit of dollars, euros and yen flowed into risk assets: stocks, commodities, real estate, fine art and, significantly, cryptocurrencies. Now we’re all paying the price for that as an inevitable inflation problem is prompting the U.S. Federal Reserve to remove the punch bowl.  With good reason: Crypto’s concurrent collapse with stocks and other assets led some to question the claim that bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset and a hedge against inflation. But I think the excessive part of the crypto price rally – the part that took bitcoin from $30,000 to $65,000 but not that which drove it from $10,000 to $30,000 – was perhaps due to exogenous factors.  Once prices settle, we should be in a better position to gauge how much of their future advances will be driven by legitimate crypto-only factors such as those described in points one through four, and how much is caught up in the risk-on/risk-off whims of a global financial system addicted to central bank largesse.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

42410929,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtSUv,1643400187,OpenSea’s Week From Hell,"There’s no question that OpenSea, now far and away the most dominant non-fungible token marketplace, has been a success for its investors. It was valued at over $13 billion earlier this month, cementing its status as a unicorn among unicorns. And last week, it was integrated directly into Twitter’s new NFT verification mechanism – a real coup for visibility among the non-tech crowd.  But it’s lonely at the top.  As the industry’s de facto one-stop shop for NFTs, OpenSea has also attracted most of the criticism. The question of whether it's been a success for its investors is probably less important, for the health of the space, than whether it's been a success for the creators it purports to serve. Events this week have precipitated something of an identity crisis: Does OpenSea want to be a marketplace, a hub for artists or an unregulated casino?  Uncanceled Listings  On Monday, traders started to notice valuable NFTs selling for well below their asking prices. The cheapest tokens in the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection will run you around $200,000 – so why did one suddenly sell for just 0.77 ether (ETH), or less than $2,000, without the permission of its owner?  Some news outlets and data providers characterized it as a “bug,” borrowing language from a blog post by the blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. But the reality isn’t quite so simple.  It has to do with the way OpenSea processes listings on the blockchain. To list an NFT for sale on OpenSea, you first need to “approve” the token for trading on its platform. This is an on-chain transaction, so you’ll need to pay gas fees (usually around $30 or so) to the network. Once you’ve “approved” the token, you pick your price and the NFT is listed for sale.  Now imagine that an hour later the market value of your NFT drops significantly. OpenSea lets you re-list the same NFT at a lower price without paying extra gas fees, but ends up creating a new listing instead of just lowering the price of the old one.  It’s the cost of working with data directly on the blockchain: an append-only distributed ledger that’s purposely resistant to change. OpenSea can’t change a listing on-chain, because what’s already happened on-chain can’t be changed. This sense of immutability is the basic fundament of blockchain tech.  If you list at 1 ETH, then drop it to 0.8 before making a sale at 0.6, you’ve still got two unfulfilled listings floating around, at 1 ETH and 0.8 ETH.  In the case of the Ape that sold for 0.77 ETH, its owner (someone called TBALLER) minted the token last year when the dollar value of the Bored Ape Yacht Club was essentially zero. He bounced it around between a few different wallets over the past nine months and listed it for 250 ETH about two weeks ago.  But a look at the token’s “Item History” on OpenSea shows there are plenty of other old, unfulfilled listings from around the time TBALLER minted the NFT. The listings may have expired, or TBALLER may have used the “lower price” button to create new ones – but the old ones are still there, even now.  And because canceling a listing is an on-chain transaction, you’ll need to pay gas fees for each cancellation (again, around $30 per transaction, plus or minus depending on network stress).  Crucially, these were TBALLER’s own listings. Buying an NFT with someone else’s uncanceled listings attached won’t make you vulnerable to this sort of sniping.  Still, it’s a miserable reality: If you’ve ever sold a token on OpenSea, odds are you’ve got a few uncanceled listings somewhere out there – listings that will almost certainly be an expensive hassle to cancel.  So, the 0.77 ETH sale wasn’t the result of a “bug,” really. It’s just the way the platform is built. OpenSea said as much in an email to CoinDesk earlier this week, characterizing the sale as “not an exploit or a bug,” but instead ""an issue that arises because of the nature of the blockchain.""  Not accidentally, the statement contains strong echoes of crypto’s overarching libertarian security philosophy. It’s not the code that’s wrong, suggests OpenSea, it’s you, the user, who failed to do your own research. After all, it’s already in OpenSea’s FAQ section.  Read more: Ape Theft Is an Expensive Way to Learn About Crypto's Security Philosophy  On Wednesday, the company sent a short email to account holders looking to address the issue. The subject was “Clarification on Canceling Inactive Listings,” and the body of the email essentially just reminded users to cancel their old listings.  Of course, canceling an old listing is still an on-chain transaction, which means it’s appended to the very end of the blockchain. Scammers with their eye on new transactions might see that you’ve canceled an old listing and immediately begin digging into your other old listings, looking for a juicy one. Even worse, they might just pay an extra fee to frontrun your cancellation, executing a sale before you can even complete your transaction (frontrunning is a common issue on proof-of-work blockchains like Ethereum).  OpenSea’s solution was just to give out refunds rather than implementing new guidelines or protections for customers. Per Bloomberg Thursday, OpenSea has already reimbursed users to the tune of $1.8 million.  OpenSea’s shared storefront  The company took a similarly reactive tack to a controversy around its smart contracts, which bubbled up later in the week.  OpenSea lets users mint their own NFTs through a shared smart contract called the Shared Storefront – essentially a template for assigning a token to a media file. Hardcore Ethereum developers tend to prefer writing their own contracts, which offers greater flexibility and control. But for newcomers, the Shared Storefront is a common go-to.  On Thursday, OpenSea suddenly decided to cap the number of NFTs users could create this way, citing user “feedback” about the site’s creator tools.  Backlash was swift, and the company reversed the decision later in the day. It gave its reasons in a tweet thread:  “We originally built our shared storefront contract to make it easy for creators to onboard into the space. However, we've recently seen misuse of this feature increase exponentially. Over 80% of the items created with this tool were plagiarized works, fake collections and spam.”  It’s a casual way of copping to a mammoth screwup: “80% of the items created with this tool were plagiarized works, fake collections, and spam.”  The NFT space has always been rife with plagiarism and spam, and OpenSea has played a major role in unleashing these forces. It’s difficult to imagine that a cap on the Shared Storefront would somehow stem the tide – but it’s OpenSea’s sorry reaction, more than anything else, that should have users worried.  OpenSea and its investors don’t need to care about plagiarism because it actively helps their business model: the company takes a cut of each sale, and a sale’s a sale, legitimate or not.  Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs have worked to make “creators,” not traders, the face of the NFT movement. Ultimately, it’s creators’ work on the line.  Blaming users for plagiarism and blaming “the nature of the blockchain” for the uncanceled listings debacle, while saying nothing of poor communications and user experience (UX) design (there was no quick way to see uncanceled listings before this week), is a cheap way of avoiding responsibility.  These weren’t amateurs losing their NFTs – they were experienced traders, the kinds of people who use OpenSea every day.  The company is only just starting to accept some level of responsibility for the plagiarism and exploitation it helped enable. Reimbursements and apology letters are a temporary band-aid, not a real solution.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/28/openseas-week-from-hell,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1cb46001e9d2ee7084934ba73e08ac158942a25-3264x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394553,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBjc7,1643399921,How to Pick the Right Play-to-Earn Game for You,"It's no secret that gaming has turned from a passive hobby to a multibillion-dollar industry. According to Accenture, the global business is currently valued at over $300 billion, driven by an influx of new gamers looking for social interaction.  With the rise of the blockchain, the industry paradigm has changed. Instead of money going only to game developers and distributors, players can now generate an income from cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using their computer or smartphone in play-to-earn games. The trend has even reached the major game distributors, with Ubisoft announcing plans to launch NFTs into the next Ghost Recon game.  Before getting started with these types of games, it’s critical to understand how they work and how you can actualize a return for your gaming hours.  What are play-to-earn games?  In many games – especially Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games – players collect digital items to further their progress. These can include in-game objects like weapons, property or wearables. They’re usually earned as rewards for completing quests and challenges, or acquired from loot boxes bought with real currency. From various skins to in-game currency, items let gamers customize their characters with new outfits and better equipment, but none of these can be sold to other players for cash.  This is where play-to-earn games – or GameFi – come into play. Leveraging the immutability of blockchain technology, game designers can create in-game items and rewards that are provably unique and transferable. Rewards can range from earning native digital currencies to collecting NFTs or be earned from staking. In turn, coins can be exported to crypto wallets to be converted to fiat currency like U.S. dollars, while NFTs can be sold to other players via in-house trading platforms or secondary marketplaces.  The popular play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, for example, allows players to purchase, battle and breed virtual creatures (called “Axies”) minted exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain. Because each Axie is represented by an NFT, they can be bought and sold peer-to-peer using cryptocurrency.  How to pick the right play-to-earn game  Once you understand how play-to-earn games work, you can start looking for one (or several) that works best for you. With hundreds of play-to-earn games already out there (and hundreds more in development), the question is, how do you find the best one for you?  The key to this is all about the fine print. Before you jump in, you need to understand how rewards are paid out, how you can convert in-game coins to other cryptocurrencies and what you actually want to gain from your experience.  Decide your goal: Coins, NFTs or both  Each play-to-earn game offers players rewards in different forms. Most games will payout rewards in a combination of NFTs and in-game cryptocurrency, which can be traded and sold to other players or external traders. In some rare cases, players can earn popular currencies for their play. In the game Coin Hunt World, players can explore their neighborhoods for keys that unlock quizzes. Answer correctly, and you are rewarded with bitcoin and ether – the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum.  When getting started, it’s important to understand how you will earn rewards for gameplay, and how much time it will take to earn them. While some require simple tasks to earn NFTs, others need a bigger investment to get rewarded.  How easy is it to cash out your coins?  Although many play-to-earn games are built on popular blockchains (like Ethereum and Polygon), converting them to another coin may not be an easy process. NFTs can take time to sell, while in-game coin values can fluctuate quickly.  Before investing your time in a game, do your research to understand how you can utilize your coins for real-world earnings. Knowing how to convert your digital items can help you decide if the game is the right one for your goals.  How much should you spend to get started?  Like other video games, getting started in a play-to-earn game often requires you to buy a starter pack with cryptocurrency. Depending on which game you decide to start in, your entry cost may vary.  For the incredibly popular Axie Infinity, you will need to purchase at least three Axies to get started. On the Axie Infinity Marketplace, Common Axies sell for anywhere between $35 and $70, while rarer Axies can go for hundreds of dollars.  With other games, you won’t need to make a purchase to start, but will ultimately need to spend cash to access premium features or play-to-earn aspects. In the virtual world game Decentraland, you can start with little more than a MetaMask wallet. If you enjoy it enough to claim a username, you will need to purchase 100 MANA (around $216 currently) to “build” it.  Cryptocurrency earned from play-to-earn games comes with inherent risk and no guarantee of return. Only invest what you can afford, on the understanding that it may take a while to get a return (and you may never profit at all).  How can I find existing and upcoming games?  Once you have decided to dive into play-to-earn games, your next step is to find one that aligns with your interests and price point. With over 400 active blockchain games online today, finding the best one for you is all about research.  Two key places to watch for new play-to-earn game options are data tracking websites DappRadar and CoinMarketCap. While DappRadar offers insight on the GameFi marketplace based on users and volume, CoinMarketCap gives insight into a game’s token price trends, helping you determine the right time to get involved in a game.  Bottom line: How profitable are play-to-earn crypto games?  Play-to-earn games combine the fun of video games with the opportunity to earn real rewards for your time. But as with any financial product, there is no such thing as a “typical” earnings, and your returns may vary.  In Axie Infinity, research published in July 2021 by the Cryptoday newsletter on Substack showed the average player could earn around 1,125 Smooth Love Potion tokens per week. At the then-high of $0.3462 per token, a gamer could earn an estimated $389.48 per week. Since then, the price of the tokens has dropped significantly, leading British investing firm Three Body Capital Management to revise the average earnings in November 2021 to around $100 per week.  Actual gameplay is only one way to gain returns in the metaverse. A 2021 report by investment firm Grayscale shows all-time secondary market NFT sales in Decentraland have grown by around 2.5-times in between September 2020 and 2021, going past the $100 million mark. The positive growth led the company to launch a single-asset trust for the MANA coin in early 2021. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)  While play-to-earn crypto games can be profitable, they often come with both an initial monetary investment and a time cost to learn the game and grow your investment. By doing your due diligence and preparing to go long in your GameFi experience, it’s possible to have fun and earn valuable cryptocurrency rewards for your time.

42375394,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7dXB,1643399873,WisdomTree Launching Retail Crypto App,"WisdomTree Investments is prepping the launch of a digital finance app that will allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies and other financial products.  The move, which was announced on Friday, will expand the New York-based asset manager’s purview with a greater focus on retail traders. It makes WisdomTree the latest example of a traditional finance firm bringing more crypto options into the mix.  In a blog post, Will Peck, WisdomTree’s head of digital assets, said the firm wants the app to “provide a core suite of savings, payments and investment” services while avoiding the worst of “trading and speculation.”  It’s a product not dissimilar to that offered by Bakkt, the digital asset firm that went public in a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger last year. Bakkt has seen its share price lag in 2022 amid crypto and stock market volatility, as the stock has fallen about 57% year to date. Shares of Robinhood Markets, which offers crypto and equity trading, have dropped about 35% during the same period.  Unlike Robinhood’s crypto service, “WisdomTree Prime” will be ""blockchain native"" at launch. Building the platform on the latest blockchain architecture was a way for WisdomTree to tap new financial services infrastructure, Peck said in an interview.  Removing intermediaries also drove WisdomTree to a blockchain-based approach, Peck said, adding that the initiative won’t put WisdomTree in a “giant cost hole.”  The investment firm seeks a beta launch in some U.S. states during the second quarter and expects a national rollout later this year.

42390157,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUu85R,1643397465,4 Reasons Privacy Coins Haven't Taken Off,"The “Cypherpunk’s Manifesto” begins, “Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.” But privacy coins – cryptocurrencies with strong privacy features—have failed to take off. Monero and zcash are both worth less today than what they were worth in 2018. In comparison, ether (ETH) is worth more than twice its 2018 high.  Haseeb Qureshi is a managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, a cross-border crypto venture fund. This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  That’s just price, but the adoption metrics haven’t fared much better. Even on darknet markets, where you’d expect privacy coins to thrive, bitcoin (BTC) is still the asset of choice. See the Rand Corporation's extensive work into illicit finance, which can be found through the Dark Web Observatory:  Fewer than 10% of zcash tokens in existence are even shielded or private. User and transaction growth has been mediocre across the board compared with smart contract platforms.  Privacy coins have been a disappointment. Why haven’t they taken off?  There are four primary reasons.  1. Nobody wants to transact in privacy coins.  While people may want their money to be private, they don’t want to pay each other in privacy coins. When most people think of “private cryptocurrencies,” they imagine private BTC or ETH, or perhaps private stablecoins. Few people actually want to settle debts in a special coin whose only defining characteristic is that it can be private.  This is why Ethereum-based privacy systems like Tornado Cash have so much uptake in comparison. Tornado brings privacy to where people actually are – on smart contract chains, in currencies they actually want to use like ETH, USDC or DAI. Compare that to Monero, where the wallets, off-ramps and liquidity are so poor that most users will give up.  The other reason why Tornado has been successful is because it internalizes the costs of privacy on the users who actually care about it rather than forcing everyone to bear the costs of privacy. This brings us to the second reason why privacy coins haven’t been successful.  2. Privacy isn’t easy yet.  The history of HTTPS, the encrypted hypertext protocol used to access almost every website today, teaches us that people will only choose privacy when it’s easy.  Website connections used to be all in plaintext. Initially, HTTPS was only used on websites that handled credit cards or banking data because it was slow and cumbersome. HTTPS became the default only after the computational costs became cheap enough that websites could enforce it without users noticing.  Something similar happened for messaging services. WhatsApp, the largest end-to-end (E2E) encrypted service, quietly turned on E2E encryption in 2016 without ever consulting users.  These two changes have done more for privacy on the internet than perhaps anything else, and neither involved users making intentional decisions to be more private.  Compare that to the difficulty of using monero or zcash for conducting everyday transactions. Both require technical sophistication and impose very high friction to protect one’s privacy.  Which brings us to the third reason privacy coins have failed.  3. Most people don’t care about privacy.  This is the uncomfortable truth behind the failure of privacy coins.  Look at people’s revealed preferences. They use social media apps that openly sell data to third parties. They use Venmo and publicly broadcast their payments to the world. They use SMS, which is stored in plaintext and can be subpoenaed by law enforcement, all while WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram are free and readily at hand.  It’s tempting to blame this situation on a lack of consumer awareness, but that doesn’t fit the facts. Take social media companies: Despite a parade of massive scandals, from Cambridge Analytica to last year’s Twitter hacks, social media use has never been higher.  Privacy is a public good. The iron rule of economics is that public goods are undersupplied by free markets. If only a small number of users use privacy-preserving technologies, the use of those technologies will become stigmatizing. Compare WhatsApp, which makes E2E encryption ubiquitous and normal, to Monero, which is similarly private but instantly flagged as suspicious.  There are two underlying types of people here. First, there are people who don’t care at all about serious privacy and just want their immediate neighbors, spouses and friends not to know what they’re doing. Blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are fine for that; their unsophisticated neighbors won’t be able to track their activities.  Then there are the privacy-conscious people who want strong enough privacy controls to defend against sophisticated third parties. Technologies like Monero, when used correctly, are robust enough to deter corporations, governments and motivated attackers. But all of that comes at a steep price.  Few people are willing to pay what the privacy-conscious group is willing to pay for privacy. Until the cost of privacy decreases dramatically, we shouldn’t expect to see an HTTPS-style transformation come to crypto.  Which brings us to regulation.  4. To survive a bear attack, you don’t need to outrun a bear – you just need to outrun the person behind you.  Privacy coins have always been the first target for regulatory inquisitions. When regulators are charged to “don’t just stand there, do something,” the easiest boogeyman is shadowy privacy coins.  On the regulatory side, we’ve seen a slew of privacy coin delistings in South Korea, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. Governments are continually trying to tighten the noose on privacy coins (see here, here, and here).  See also: Crypto Isn't the Cause of Ransomware. It Might Be the Cure | Opinion  Crypto lobbies have grown larger; huge swaths of retail and many institutions now own BTC and ETH. But very few institutions are willing to come to the defense of privacy coins. Rather than allow the entire industry to be tainted, many are content to let privacy coins become the sacrificial lamb.  I’m an admirer of the bold work Coin Center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have done to protect the civil liberties of Americans when it comes to using privacy-preserving technologies. But I worry that when it comes to private cryptocurrencies, they’re fighting a losing battle.  Until then, expect regulators to continue scapegoating privacy coins, and expect their acceptance and liquidity to suffer for it. If I were a betting man, I’d expect painless privacy solutions that integrate with decentralized finance and stablecoins to be the biggest growth area in privacy.

Past Bitcoin Volatility Index Pattern Suggests A Short Squeeze May Happen Here As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC volatility index has now reached values where a short squeeze has happened in the past. The &apos;volatility index&apos; is an indicator that shows how much the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated in a day compared to its historical average. When the value of this metric rises, it means the crypto&apos;s price has recently seen higher volatility as its price has deviated more from its average. On the other hand, low values suggest Bitcoin has been relatively stable lately as the price hasn&apos;t seen any large movements. Volatility is often high following a liquidation event. These &apos;liquidation squeezes&apos; happen when the market is overleveraged, and so any big swings in the price lead to mass liquidations of futures positions.

42411525,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOjnY,1643395784,"Reflecting on Facebook's Hilarious, Well-Deserved Crypto Failure","Reports surfaced this week that Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms, is planning to sell intellectual assets from its proposed digital currency, originally dubbed Libra, and shutter the project. Drinks are on me, because there’s nothing quite so gratifying as watching Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg fail – and Libra, later known as Diem, was a glorious trash fire of unforced screwups from beginning to end. If you dream of a future in which our online world isn’t dominated by predatory data hoarders, the ineptitude displayed by Facebook here should keep you warm until spring.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The collapse of Libra/Diem is a huge positive, not just for the crypto industry, but for privacy and social justice more generally. A successful launch of Diem would have disastrously muddied the waters about what constitutes a real cryptocurrency, since Facebook’s token was never going to be properly decentralized or uncensorable. The project also appeared poised to give a new stream of transaction data to a company that will go down in history as the Standard Oil, United Fruit or R.J. Reynolds of digital surveillance. That such a rapacious and destructive entity has been rebuffed from creating its own currency is a win for humanity.  And there are broader positive lessons to be learned – above all, that wealthy and influential people still have to exhibit at least a shred of competence to get what they want. The Libra effort was a shambolic mess from the jump, with Facebook showing again and again that it hadn’t thought through the implications of either its overall goal or its specific proposals. That it went down in flames shows there’s at least still some justice in the world. These are the supposed masters of the digital universe, and they still failed because their ideas were so fundamentally terrible and consistently half-baked. All the money in the world can’t buy brains – at least, not if you’re Mark Zuckerberg. (For a full rundown of the mess, check out CoinDesk’s complete Libra chronology.)  The saga is also a reminder to give some serious side-eye to the public relations claims of any tech company, especially Meta. That’s particularly worth remembering as the former Facebook now attempts to build the virtual-reality based social network Horizon Worlds. While the regulatory landmines may be fewer, Zuck’s “metaverse” pitch is just as conceptually flawed and morally bankrupt as Libra was, and will be largely overseen by the same C-suite that guided Libra off a cliff.  Probably the clearest sign of how badly Facebook screwed up its coin ambitions is that the name of the overall project was changed from “Libra” to “Diem” in December of 2020, just after the “Calibra” wallet that Facebook was building rebranded to “Novi,” and barely 18 months after the initial announcement. Facebook framed the change as an attempt to affirm the project’s independence from Facebook, but Occam’s razor suggests it was really to wash off the stink of the torrent of white-hot hostility that greeted Libra’s initial launch.  That tarnishing began almost immediately, with project lead David Marcus’ hapless performance before the House Financial Services Committee in July of 2019. Facebook was clearly on hostile ground – the hearing opened with California Congressman Brad Sherman comparing Libra to the 9/11 hijackers.  But Marcus made things even worse by failing to clearly address a laundry list of really, really obvious uncertainties about Libra. Those included whether Libra could be used to pay for, say, illegal drugs – and if not, who had the power to censor transactions? Marcus also failed to allay concerns that Libra’s use of a basket of currencies as backing for a global stablecoin would destabilize national currencies, including the U.S. dollar itself. Close listeners heard him weaseling about plans for collecting and sharing Libra transaction data, even as Facebook was still in the midst of a privacy scandal.  The privacy questions were closely linked to legislators’ skepticism that the Libra project would be a “nonprofit” independent of Facebook’s control. Facebook’s hilariously inept attempt to make it seem like it wasn’t in control of Libra involved creating a “Libra Association” made up of companies including, for about 10 seconds, Visa, PayPal and Uber. To set up this group, Facebook, a massive public company, basically copied and pasted the “Swiss nonprofit foundation” legal structure that was popular among sometimes-shady initial coin offering-driven crypto projects circa 2017-2018.  This structure was generally a convenient fiction when used by small-time crypto-native projects, and Facebook’s group seemed just as much of a paper-thin misdirect. Facebook had invited all the members, most of them had preexisting ties to Facebook, and some even suggested they had felt pressured to join. Harvard tech scholar Primavera De Filippi told Wired at the time that the Libra Association created only “a facade of decentralization.” The fact that lawyers for a then-$400 billion market cap public company looked at the scheme and assumed it would convince U.S. lawmakers that Facebook wasn’t really in charge suggests nothing short of gross incompetence up and down the org chart.  See also: Diem: A Dream Deferred? | The Node  For critical-minded crypto insiders at the time, all this was high-grade surrealist comedy. My immediate reaction to Marcus’ testimony was nothing short of befuddlement – it was simply hard to believe that an executive in his position was so painfully unprepared for immensely important testimony.  Taken as a whole, the list of fumbles in the Libra saga is so long that it nudges you towards conspiratorial speculation: What if Libra was never actually meant to launch? A full-blown tinfoil-hat theory might speculate that it was all an elaborate attempt to undermine open systems like Bitcoin, perhaps an echo of Zuckerberg mentor Peter Theil’s affinity for tightly moated tech monopolies. More reasonably, commentators like CoinTalk’s Aaron Lammer figured the “decentralized” elements of Libra would be slowly scaled back until it was just another attempt at doing payments in-house at Facebook.  But in the end, Facebook couldn’t even salvage that much from the wreckage.

The funds had about $30 million and $13 million under management, respectively, at the end of last year.  ChainLink Capital isn’t related to the Chainlink token and protocol, and the Luna fund isn’t tied to LUNA, the native token of the Terra blockchain.  Founded in 2018, ChainLink embraces a “fund of funds” strategy to provide diversification and exposure to crypto experts while mitigating the risks that are “still unfortunately quite abundant these days in crypto,” said Hoppin, a former chief technology officer for the New York State Senate.  The Luna Fund is backed by large family and multifamily offices. It includes hedge funds that manage tokens, including bitcoin and ethereum, and funds that generate returns from liquid token holdings, which include lending and staking. Holdings include Coinbase and non-fungible token marketplace Rarible.  The newer Ama Fund, which was launched in the fall of 2020, includes hedge funds taking a more risk-neutral approach to digital asset investments. The fund has noted blockchain analyst Willy Woo as its research head.

42396154,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0yMe,1643392529,Hong Kong Regulators Impose Limits on Investing in Spot Crypto ETFs,"Hong Kong financial regulators have published new guidance for intermediaries looking to offer virtual asset-linked products like exchange-traded funds (ETF) to investors. The new rules single out products like spot ETFs that track the current price of assets such as bitcoin and allow immediate buying or selling.  According to a circular published Friday, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) determined spot markets for virtual assets are “largely unregulated at present, [so] they are more likely to present investor protection issues, ranging from a lack of pricing transparency to potential market manipulation.”  The HKMA and SFC are issuing the new guidance after receiving “an increasing number of enquiries” from service providers that were interested in offering virtual asset-backed products to their customers, the circular said.  Virtual asset-linked products have become increasingly popular, particularly after U.S. regulators approved the first bitcoin futures ETF in October and that fund hit close to $1 billion in volume on its first day of trading. But the U.S. has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF. On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected a proposal for a spot ETF days after rejecting another proposal.  In the meantime, other countries, including Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Brazil, have all shown a preference for spot ETFs.  Hong Kong’s new rules are designed to protect investors and include limiting the sale of spot products to professional investors, the circular said. Another requirement requires service providers to test their clients on their knowledge of virtual assets.  The rules aren’t so strict for derivatives-based products. Even though they will still be considered complex financial instruments, the “professional investors only” restriction doesn't apply to futures-based exchange-traded products related to virtual assets, the circular said.  “In the case of virtual asset futures contracts traded on a specified exchange which is a regulated futures market, trading is governed by conventional rules. Pricing transparency and potential market manipulation may be less of a concern,” the circular said, adding that the same applies to futures ETFs.  The new guidance also highlights that exposure to non-derivative ETF products offered overseas should be limited to professional investors. According to the circular, Hong Kong regulators feel the risks of these “complex” exchange traded products are “not reasonably likely to be understood by a retail investor.”  “To provide adequate investor protection, the SFC and the HKMA consider it appropriate and necessary to require intermediaries to partner only with SFC-licensed [virtual asset] trading platforms,” the circular said.  The SFC and the HKMA is giving a six-month transition period for virtual asset service providers to revise their systems and controls to meet the new guidelines.  “Intermediaries which do not currently engage in [virtual asset]-related activities should ensure that they are able to comply with the requirements in this circular before introducing such services,” the circular said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/28/hong-kong-regulators-impose-limitations-on-investing-in-spot-crypto-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97a31b30a783ce057b731548518f430b2dc6fd1a-5538x3788.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396141,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0yBp,1643392131,Trezor Backtracks on ‘Travel Rule’ App for Self-Hosted Crypto Wallets Amid Uproar,"SatoshiLabs, the creator of the Trezor hardware wallet, has shelved plans to adopt an automated protocol for proving ownership of a self-hosted wallet when withdrawing digital assets from an exchange in Switzerland, where that's a requirement.  The U-turn from Trezor followed a Twitter storm from customers and privacy buffs.  Trezor announced Thursday it would integrate the ""Address Ownership Proof Protocol"" (AOPP), created by 21 Analytics, a Swiss fintech firm specializing in bringing crypto firms up to speed with anti-money laundering (AML) requirements set out by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial watchdog.  “Adopting AOPP was a small step toward improving usability for a portion of our customers with restricted access to bitcoin,” a SatoshiLabs spokesperson said Friday via email. “It was not a step taken due to any external pressure, regulatory or otherwise, and no similar implementations are planned.”  The reaction from the crypto community speaks to a growing tension when it comes to the steady march of AML regulations into the private reaches of self-hosted wallets.  Switzerland (and Singapore for that matter) have gone beyond the FATF recommendations for data sharing among virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to include the identification of private wallets transacting with VASPs in those places.  AOPP doesn't compromise users’ privacy, as the personal data being made automatically available is already known to the Swiss VASPs, 21 Analytics has pointed out. The application is meant to simplify the digital signing of data that corresponds to a specific destination address.  However, Crypto Twitter didn’t see it that way.  “I didn’t expect this reaction from the Twitter Bitcoin Community. For the users affected by this regulation, AOPP is a great benefit, requiring user opt-in to perform any actions,” 21 Analytics CEO Lucas Betschart said in an email to CoinDesk, adding:  “Others seem to see it as a threat, opening the door for further measures. This is not the intent.

42390158,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUu8AZ,1643389670,Mastercard’s CipherTrace Used ‘Honeypots’ to Gather Crypto Wallet Intel,"On March 3, 2020, just before lunchtime in Washington, D.C., Stephen Ryan sent someone at the U.S. Treasury department a thank-you note with a curious detail.  The chief operating officer and co-founder of cryptocurrency sleuthing firm CipherTrace, Ryan was one of 16 executives who attended an industry summit the day before with then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Along with his gratitude for the meeting, Ryan attached a slide deck that laid out CipherTrace’s strategy for demystifing crypto wallets. Among those methods: “honey pots.”  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Privacy Week series.  Ryan’s note was part of a 250-page trove of Mnuchin's emails obtained by CoinDesk through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Portions of his slide deck closely resemble CipherTrace’s public promotional materials. Those, too, have referenced “honeypots,” or the similar “crypto money pots,” since at least 2018.  What did CipherTrace mean by these terms? The cybersecurity community uses the phrase “honey pot” to describe a decoy target that collects intelligence on unsuspecting attackers. In other words, a trap.  CipherTrace, which payments giant Mastercard purchased last autumn for an undisclosed price, is part of a cottage industry that monitors the $14 billion-a-year crossroads of cryptocurrency and crime. Sifting through millions of daily transactions recorded on blockchains, or public ledgers, firms such as Chainalysis, TRM Labs and Elliptic search for red flags and illicit movements, labeling suspect addresses as they go.  The companies cast their services as essential to normalizing crypto and stamping out crime. Detractors lambast these tracing firms as on-chain narcs, even though they are primarily working with public information.  CipherTrace wouldn’t be the first company in this niche to set snares in hopes of capturing information that can’t be found on-chain. Chainalysis, the leading crypto tracing vendor, has for years owned a wallet explorer site that captures visitors’ IP addresses and links them to the blockchain addresses they looked up. The company acknowledged this practice only in October, a month after CoinDesk published an article drawing attention to it.  More than half a dozen cryptocurrency industry veterans told CoinDesk they had no idea what CipherTrace meant by “honeypots.” In a statement provided to CoinDesk, the Los Gatos, Calif.-based company gave the basic computer security definition without explaining what it meant in the context of blockchain analysis.  “A ‘crypto money pot’ or ‘honeypot’ is a security term referring to a mechanism that creates a virtual trap to lure would-be-attackers,” CipherTrace said, adding that the documents mentioning these tactics are old. “CipherTrace does not use ‘crypto money pots” anymore,"" it said (although the company’s website touted both money and honey pots as of Thursday).  CoinDesk asked CipherTrace: “Does your firm collect IP address data for the purposes of linking them to wallet addresses?”  A CipherTrace representative responded: “As a privacy-focused company, CipherTrace does not map IP data to private individuals.”  She did not answer CoinDesk’s question of whether CipherTrace maps IPs to wallets. CoinDesk asked a second time if CipherTrace maps IP addresses to wallet addresses. CipherTrace did not respond.  Such caginess “is a frequent issue in the privacy space, when we talk about network identifiers like IP addresses.,” said Sean O’Brien, a cybersecurity researcher. “Companies try to distance themselves from what you would traditionally call personally identifiable information by saying IP addresses are something else. In fact, they're incredibly useful for identifying households, businesses and individuals.”  For example, “if you need to investigate a Bitcoin transaction related to a suspected cybercrime, IP addresses are exactly the kind of information you’d be looking for,” O’Brien said. “The earliest cases involving law enforcement and the internet hinge on IP addresses as evidence, for good reason. And, they’re just as useful to harass and stalk people as they are to prosecute them.”  Following the money  Tracing companies have long been a major if under-recognized force in crypto’s institutional march. Fighting back against the perception that bitcoin is primarily a criminal finance tool, they parse the data to pinpoint the meager share that actually is.  Chainalysis recently estimated that 0.15% of crypto transactions in 2021 were illicit – by far the smallest percentage on record. (“Illicit” wallets amassed a record-high $14 billion last year, a seemingly paradoxical stat that Chainalysis attributed to crypto’s booming growth.)  CipherTrace says its mission is to “grow the cryptocurrency economy by making it trusted by governments, safe for mass adoption and protecting financial institutions from crypto laundering risks.”  Taken from the presentation shared with the Treasury Department, that description would likely be shared by every competing firm. It gets at the heart of detractors' concerns. Privacy maximalists believe Bitcoin’s radically transparent but pseudonymous nature ought to flow independent of the state, and they see these companies’ work as a betrayal of that ideal.  “It's kind of an invasion of privacy of users, the same way that you might complain about centralized web analytics companies that are collecting IP addresses and putting cookies on people's computers and tracking them from site to site,” said John Light, a longtime crypto educator, writer, podcaster and event organizer.  On-chain analytics is, at its core, an attribution race.  In cybersecurity circles, attribution means identifying the perpetrators of a hack. In the crypto context, it refers specifically to blockchain sleuths’ practice of linking pseudonymous wallet addresses to identifiable actors. These actors could be licensed crypto exchanges or custodians, ransomware attackers, darknet marketplaces or sanctioned individuals or entities.  For example: Anyone with an internet connection can see that, say, wallet abc123 transferred 0.5 BTC to zxy987; this information is rather useless on its own. But a tracer database might document that the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control has identified zxy987 as belonging to a sanctioned African warlord. Or it could show that abc123’s bitcoin was stolen from an exchange.  That’s valuable information for exchanges that want to cut out illicit activity, for users who want to keep their coins clean, for governments who want to follow the money. It comes together through rigorous attribution.  With potentially millions of dollars in investigatory contracts up for grabs, these companies have an acute need to mine novel attribution data. CipherTrace, for example, has scored 20 contracts with federal agencies, worth up to $3.5 million, since 2018, the most recent being an expert witness job, according to public records.  In an industry that rewards builders of nuanced, detailed, attribution datasets – and a field where criminals are hungry for intelligence to help them escape notice – guarding the attribution secret sauce is paramount, two longtime practitioners said.  Nevertheless, in his email to the Treasury Department, Ryan offered a taste “of how cryptocurrency attribution is achieved.” Honeypots were listed as one of the “active” strategies in the slide deck.  Chainalysis: Blockchain attribution ace  CipherTrace’s biggest competitor began operating its own novel technique three years before.  Founded in 2014 and valued in June at $4.2 billion, Chainalysis is the tracing industry’s big kahuna. It has racked up tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts selling software that visualizes on-chain activity. While anyone with an internet connection can self-sift through public blockchain records, you’d need a little help to make sense of what you find down the rabbit hole.  But the tracer’s true business ace is its attribution dataset, three industry insiders said. No other company has amassed a trove of wallet data as detailed as Chainalysis’, the sources said.  That’s partly because no other tracer has as massive a business footprint. Chainalysis provides tracing software to 500 “virtual asset service providers,” or VASP, as regulators call them. It's a mutually beneficial relationship. The businesses get powerful crypto compliance tools, and Chainalysis adds their wallet addresses to its global database. It does not, however, ask clients for data on their customers.  “We can’t speak for all other vendors. It’s possible other vendors may ask for more information. But Chainalysis is concerned only with service-level transaction data,” the company explained in a 2019 blog post. In other words, it identifies only businesses that it knows control wallets, not people.  But that wasn’t the whole story, and Chainalysis’ customers, and public information about wallets, were not the firm’s only sources of intel.  In an undated slideshow for Italian police that was leaked in September, a Chainalysis sales team described how the company’s vast network of Bitcoin and Electrum wallet nodes capture valuable user data such as IP addresses from connecting wallets. This helped investigators follow meaningful criminal leads, the presentation said.  The slideshow also shed new light on walletexplorer.com, a popular Bitcoin block explorer run by Chainalysis since 2015. According to the documents, which CoinDesk verified were authentic, the website “scrapes” suspicious users’ IP addresses, linking their internet footprint with their wallet address. This dataset has provided “meaningful leads” for law enforcement.  ”It was never a secret that Chainalysis owned and operated walletexplorer.com. Since 2015 there has been a statement at the bottom of the homepage that the author of the site works at Chainalysis as an analyst and programmer,” a company spokesperson told CoinDesk.  An open secret, perhaps, but hardly an open book. Chainalysis seldom brought attention to the fact that walletexplorer.com was funneling user data to its other business lines.  Weeks after CoinDesk reported on walletexplorer.com, the website adopted a privacy disclosure page that spelled out, for the first time, how its data trove wends its way into the Chainalysis product line.  “We share Blockchain Information and Visitor Information with our other Chainalysis business lines to help us deliver and improve those services. For example, other Chainalysis business lines may be able to use the information we provide to better connect one Bitcoin Wallet Address to another Bitcoin Wallet Address,” the Oct. 14-dated policy said.  “We more recently added a privacy notice to provide more information about how Chainalysis internally uses information collected from the walletexplorer.com website to help improve our services,” the spokesperson said.  Nothing personal?  While it remains unclear exactly what CipherTrace’s honeypots do, the word evokes a system that purports to do one thing while triggering something else. A wallet owner engaging with a “honeypot” would be definitionally oblivious to the service’s ulterior motives.  Chainalysis, CipherTrace and Elliptic have all previously stated they do not seek to tie individuals to wallets. Their business is in helping governments investigate crypto crime and keeping exchanges compliant.  Outing individuals isn’t a part of that equation. These companies simply follow the money, they say.  “The blockchain intelligence we provide links crypto transactions to real-world entities such as exchanges, darknet marketplaces and sanctioned entities,” Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs for TRM Labs, told CoinDesk.  “This intelligence allows a crypto exchange to be alerted if, for example, it processes a transaction involving an address that has previously been used for terrorist financing,” he said. “The same applies for transactions involved in hacks, ransomware, rug pulls and other attacks that harm crypto investors and users.”  But “we do not attribute transactions to individuals,” Redbord said of TRM Labs.  Similarly, CipherTrace’s representative said it “does not attribute wallet data to private individuals, with an exception for sanctioned entities.” It has done that prolifically, boasting in one 2019 blog post of attributing 72,000 Iranian IP addresses to 4.5 million wallets.  Whether CipherTrace attributes IP addresses to other wallets remains an open question. Top company brass say they don’t maintain “personally identifiable information,” just “business identifiable information.”  “CipherTrace does not maintain PII, we maintain BII” CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans said in an interview in June.  “We understand, for example, what addresses belong to what exchange,” he said. “But we don't track individual information that it’s you at this address; that's not our business. We don't want to do that. We’ll figure out where the money comes in, where the money goes out and then it's up to the courts and law enforcement,” to do the rest.

Derivative Trading in Crypto Any cryptocurrency token can be used as the underlying asset in the trading of crypto derivatives. Two parties sign into a money contract to speculate on the value of a cryptocurrency at a later period. Throughout the contract&apos;s first phase, the perimeters agree on a selling/buying value for the cryptocurrency on a particular day, regardless of its value.

The Nobel Prize-winning economist wrote in an opinion piece for The New York Times on Thursday that there's evidence that the risks of crypto are falling on those who do not know what they're getting into and are less well positioned to handle the downsides.  Citing the recent slide that has seen over $1 trillion shed from the crypto market, Krugman wrote, ""Who is being hurt by this crash, and what might it do to the economy? Well, I’m seeing uncomfortable parallels with the subprime crisis of the 2000s.""  Krugman does not believe that crypto is likely to cause a wider economic crisis, but he says that a crypto bear market would disproportionately affect the more vulnerable people in society, referencing research which finds that 55% of crypto investors do not have a college degree and anecdotal evidence that it is particularly popular among the working class.  He compares this to the way that subprime mortgages made home ownership a possibility among people for whom it was previously unlikely.  Krugman is a longtime crypto skeptic, with his criticism of bitcoin dating back to 2013 when he penned a piece for The New York Times entitled ""Bitcoin Is Evil."" He has claimed that bitcoin has no legitimate uses and no intrinsic value.

The rock-and-roll legend will be honored in February with a virtual gathering of impersonators in the Decentraland metaverse, an event put on in a partnership between Elvis Presley Enterprises and metaverse design firm Run It Wild.  The virtual block party will look to break the world record for most Elvis impersonators in one place, and yes, it will be certified by Guinness World Records.  The current record stands at just 895 impersonators, which was set in-person at a North Carolina casino in 2014. Attendees of the Decentraland attempt will be airdropped wearables of an Elvis jumpsuit and wig to qualify.  “Guinness World Records has now approved that avatars are actually human, for the sake of the record, which is pretty interesting,” Adam De Cata, head of partnerships at Decentraland, told CoinDesk in an interview. “So yeah, we are going to beat the record, with ours being virtual and the previous being physical. We’re going to smash it.”  The party is just the first step of a larger “Elvis-On-Chain” rollout, which Elvis Presley Enterprises says will give fans access to the famed singer’s IP vault through other digital assets.  Buyers who purchase the “Elvis Genesis Key” non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a part of the event will have exclusive access to further drops, along with governance rights to vote for how the IP vault will be put to use.  “Elvis loved technology. He was one of the first people to have a remote control television, you know, cell phones in his car. He had the first electronic wristwatch,” Katie Jones, senior vice president of entertainment at Authentic Brands Group (the owner of Elvis Presley Enterprises), told CoinDesk in an interview. “I'm not going to speak for him as for the metaverse, but I wouldn't be surprised.”  Read more: Warner Music Group to Launch ‘Concert Theme Park’ in Sandbox Metaverse  Run It Wild partnered with the Australian Open earlier this month for its Decentraland installation, with similar virtual events heating up as a 2022 trend.

In the project’s Discord, she’s repeatedly pressed for a partnership that would shore up that checkered reputation.  “Partnering with someone like Valkyrie really helps ensure that the community has that second pair of eyes, that second set of governance, making sure that these funds are actually being used for the benefit of the NEM and Symbol community,” Hatchet said.  That partnership comes in the form of a multisignature smart contract holding nearly 3 billion NEM tokens (worth about $295 million at current prices). Valkyrie employees control four signature slots and core contributors Jaguar, Hatchet and Gimre wield the other three. Five signatures are necessary to execute.  “I think that we're the only ones working with a DAO and protocol treasury as an asset manager,” Valkyrie CEO Leah Wald told CoinDesk in an interview.  Her company will take over the role an in-house finance team might usually serve: auditing, accounting, asset management and the like. Their newest client opted to pay a sub-1% management fee, according to the Discord.  The arrangement was met with hardly any backlash. Executed through a hard fork, over 92% of network validators approved the change, according to Hatchet. They’d been planning the shift since last August, Hatchet said.  NEM and Symbol’s conjoined communities are looking toward Valkyrie as their finance guru, the Discord server shows. Hatchet variously described Valkyrie as akin to a “CFO,” a dealmaker, a reputation builder and a possible bridge to the worlds of fintech and venture capital.  Valkyrie also sees it as a brand-building opportunity.  Wald said there’s “huge potential” in servicing DAOs’ treasury management needs. “We are talking with a few other protocols,” she said.  By Wald’s telling, there’s never been a better moment to infuse some trust into the sometimes shadowy world of pseudonymous on-chain money management. Wonderland aside, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler “is highly focused on our industry,” she said.  “I think that it does make sense for cryptocurrency protocols to partner with traditional finance asset managers or general partners as we're all in the hot seat right now,” Wald said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | FORKS,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/28/wall-street-crypto-firm-valkyrie-is-holding-a-700m-protocol-treasury,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35cd491b8f88e68270af2a905c9f4890245e8b62-1189x673.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396153,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0yJh,1643378403,FriesDAO Wants to Start a Crypto-Crowdfunded Fast-Food Franchise,"Wanna flip burgers instead of coins this crypto winter? FriesDAO certainly does.  The crypto group plans to start a fast-food franchise following ConstitutionDAO’s “let’s buy (and govern) a real-world asset with crowdfunded tokens” playbook.  On Saturday, the self-proclaimed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) will start a $9.7 million fundraising drive. In return for Ethereum-based USDC, benefactors will receive tokenized voting rights over which chain restaurant FriesDAO buys.  “You are going to have voting rights that influence decision making on the acquisition of a fast-food restaurant,” Bill Lee, a project adviser, told CoinDesk.  See also: US Constitution for Sale? ConstitutionDAO Makes Bold Moves  One thing token holders won’t get is ownership rights to FriesDAO’s franchise, a stake in its profits or final say in its business – at least not at first.  It’s simply an Ethereum-based membership coin – with a side of influence.  Such are the realities of U.S. securities laws, project leads say.  “It would be beautiful and wonderful for us to be able to sit down and say this token represents a direct ownership in a Subway, in a Wendy's,” key project contributor Brett Beller, who co-founded the booze delivery startup Drizly, said. “You cannot do that because of the way the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) has actually laid things out.”  FriesDAO – which hasn’t yet decentralized, and isn’t yet autonomous – cannot treat its token-holding denizens as business partners with an ownership stake. Doing so would be like starting a grease fire in the SEC’s cafeteria, and Gary Gensler, the agency's chairman, doesn’t like grease fires.  Bridging to business  FriesDAO is also pragmatic about pitching a “DAO” to brands. Showing up at McDonald’s headquarters with 10,000 internet friends' crowdfunded coins won’t likely work. “DAOs are still too ‘exotic’ to serve as a bona fide business partner,” Lee said.  “We're going to need some sort of external organization or contracted organization to actually acquire the fast-food stores for us, and so to make that a legally binding thing,” he said.  When asked why FriesDAO wants to buy a franchise, instead of spining up a fresh restaurant, Beller cited the omnipresent clout of mega-brands. “You’re kinda being handed the business in a box,” he said, adding that franchises are the “easiest possible situation” to showcase crypto governance.  FriesDAO might be best understood as an early stage, if slightly watered-down, proof of concept for what DAO maximalists seek: making on-chain governance a meatspace reality. It's a normalization force in a world waking up to the powers and perils of crypto.  “We believe that when a company starts a business, they should sit down, and they should be able to look at a set of tools, a B Corp., a C Corp., an LLC, a DAO,” and choose the one that fits their needs. He cited “individual creators” as one group particularly well-positioned to make use of DAOism.  Within this model, the membership tokens serve as a kind of social currency. By bringing together contributors under a common idea (but not an enterprise, and certainly not one with the expectation of future profits), FriesDAO can find the “right personnel very quickly,“ Lee said.  Growing community  FriesDAO’s Discord channel sported 4,425 “crew members” as of late Thursday, and among them were three “general managers,” two “assistant managers"" and seven “shift supervisors.” Participants posted the occasional Golden Arches meme and volunteered their services on an “I-want-to-help” channel.  “Letittie (🍟,🍟),” one member of the Discord channel who said he planned to donate, told CoinDesk in a chat that he was enthralled by the “innovative” way FriesDAO sought to blend “decentralized governance” with business management. “It will have to prove itself of course,” he said.  Other users said FriesDAO’s transparent leadership – Lee and Beller have thrown their real-world identities behind the project – had the expertise to deliver on the project’s goals. (Indeed, Beller, who said he’s already begun talks with possible partners, acknowledged his industry experience helps open doors.)  A handful cited the potential for crispy token riches, memes (“we like the fries,” one said), mainstreaming crypto and moon missions, as well as strong leadership.  “I don't think these guys would run off with our liquidity,” Beansthe3rd told CoinDesk, “but just the idea of a token revolved around owning fast-food franchises is pretty hilarious.”",NEUTRAL,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/28/friesdao-wants-to-start-a-crypto-crowdfunded-fast-food-franchise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ffbe83574f802ebda61a2ad1a8ed7ba10ecc8443-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

An analyst from Jefferies started coverage with a 12-month price target of $51, implying a 158% increase from the stock's recent closing price.  “MARA is on track to be the largest publicly traded miner by the end of 2022, with deposits paid on more BTC ASIC miners than any of its peers,'' analyst Jonathan Petersen wrote, referring to bitcoin application-specific integrated circuit miners.  Marathon is “highly profitable” despite the recent sell-off in its shares as the company’s current mining margin is around 80%, compared with about 90% in November, according to the note.  “We estimate that BTC will rise at a +32% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) through '24 and that MARA's revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) will rise at a +120% and +95% CAGR, respectively,” Petersen said.  The stock has been initiated with a buy rating by Jefferies.  On Dec. 29, Marathon Digital said it expects to have 199,000 operational miners generating 23.3 exahashes per second by early 2023. An exahash is a measure of computing power.  Marathon’s stock had fallen about 74% since reaching its November peak, according to TradingView data, as the crypto miners tumbled with the sharp sell-off in bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

42396143,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0yAq,1643376354,Anchor Protocol Reserves Slide as Money Market's Founder Talks Down Concerns,"The reserves of Terra-based lending and borrowing protocol Anchor, which offers a supposedly industry-beating benchmark deposit rate of around 20%, are sliding fast as a result of the crypto market crash.  Data provided by Terra.Engineer shows reserves have slumped by half to 35 million UST – that's Terra's native U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin – in four weeks. It works out to an average decline of about 1.25 million UST per day. The crypto community is worried that the reserves will be drained in three weeks or so in the absence of corrective measures.  ""The Anchor Yield Reserve was created as a buffer to maintain the 20% interest stability,"" pseudonymous market expert and Anchor user Duo Nine, who operates the Twitter handle @DU09BTC, told CoinDesk. ""However, this reserve has been running a deficit for weeks due to more deposits than borrowers on Anchor Protocol. At this rate, it will hit zero in 20 days.""  LUNA, Terra’s native token, dropped below the $50 mark on Friday and is down over 17% over the past 24 hours. It was recently trading at $49.31.  While most decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms allow demand-supply forces to determine lending and borrowing rates, Anchor offers an almost fixed 20% annualized percentage yield (APY) to users depositing UST. The so-called ""anchor rate"" is set by holders of Anchor's governance token, ANC. At press time, other industry heavyweights were offering lending rates of less than 10%, according to data source defirate.com.  The project finances the super-high deposit rate from three income sources: interest charged to borrowers, staking rewards earned from borrowers' collateral – such as liquid staking proof-of-stake assets from major blockchains like bonded luna (bLUNA) or bonded ether (bETH) – and liquidation fees. Luna is the native token of Terra's blockchain, while ether (ETH) powers the Ethereum blockchain.  If the realized yield from the three income sources is greater than the anchor rate, the excess amount is kept aside as the UST-denominated Anchor Yield Reserve. The protocol taps into the reserve when the realized yield is less than the anchor rate, ensuring depositors are paid as promised.  The structure makes the platform's reserve vulnerable to market crashes and the resulting imbalance between demand for loans and supply of deposits. During bearish periods, traders are less likely to borrow UST to seek higher returns elsewhere, leading to a decline in loan demand. They are also more likely to supply UST tokens in a bid to make a relatively stable return, pushing deposits higher.  That's what seems to have happened since December, forcing the platform to persistently tap the reserve, as tweeted by Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, the decentralized financial payment network behind Anchor.  Data from Anchor Protocol show total deposits stood at 5.71 billion UST at press time, while the amount borrowed was 1.37 billion UST. That's a loan demand shortage of over 300%. The yield reserve was 34.13 million UST, and the anchor rate was 19.88%.  The situation perhaps indicates that fixed rates are unsustainable over the long run and yields are better determined by free interaction of demand and supply forces.  ""The fixed yield of around 20% may not be sustainable,"" Duo Nine said. ""With the protocol facing a deficit, it needs fresh money in the form of increased loan demand to keep the anchor rate at 20%.""  Founder downplays concerns  Terraform Labs' Kwon is trying to soothe concerns about a depletion in reserves, saying the mechanism was created precisely to ensure stability during market downturns. Early today, Kwon assured crypto followers on Twitter that the protocol would function as a regular DeFi money market if the much-feared scenario of reserves dropping to zero occurred.  ""If we were to get to this hypothetical situation, Anchor will *still* offer the highest return on stablecoins. By far. It will be fine,"" Kwon tweeted.  It remains to be seen what corrective measures are implemented. Terraform Labs provided a cash injection of 70 million UST following the crypto crash of May-June 2021, which punctured the broader market bull run.  ""The deployment is a one-off solution that will prevent the need for future intervention, allocating a significant runway for the protocol to introduce self-sustainable mechanics even during periods of low borrowing demand,"" Terra Research Forum's blog post Bolstering Anchor's Sustainability published in July said.  Experts say a cash injection could be a temporary solution. It will, after all, have little impact on loan demand.  ""A capital injection will prolong the health of the system, but generally, they need to either reduce the deposit rate or increase the utility for ANC token, so it's not viewed as a farming coin,"" Hassan Bassiri, vice president of portfolio management at Arca, a digital asset management firm, said  Borrowers providing collateral are given ANC tokens proportional to the amount borrowed.  ""ANC is also used as incentives to bootstrap borrow demand and initial deposit rate stability. The protocol distributes ANC tokens every block to stablecoin borrowers, proportional to the amount borrowed,"" the official explainer says.  An ANC token with increased utility might bring loan demand and greater income for the protocol, alleviating the pressure on the reserve. Kwon has assured that he is resolved to finding ways to subsidize the yield reserve.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/28/anchor-protocol-reserves-slide-as-money-markets-founder-talks-down-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd323034a85545cccfc3e76e5ff9a685131daead-1280x941.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394557,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBjrV,1643374363,Is a Crypto Winter Coming? 3 Things to Consider,"Crypto winter is a term that’s making the rounds again as the global crypto market has shed $1.2 trillion in the last three months. Commonly associated with the bitcoin market downturn between late 2017 and late 2018, crypto winter refers to a prolonged bearish period where asset prices persistently fall over many months.  Bitcoin's price plunged more than 84% during the last crypto winter period, spreading panic throughout the rest of the market and causing a vast majority of altcoins to plummet in unison. This had the knock-on effect of triggering widespread redundancies across the blockchain industry, hindering mainstream adoption and resurfacing predictions of bitcoin crashing to zero.  It wasn’t until mid-2019 that the crypto markets showed signs of recovery – bolstered by record investment from traditional institutionshttps://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Grayscale-Digital-Asset-Investment-Report-2019-January-2020.pdf and trade tensions escalating between the U.S. and China encouraging investors to seek out economic hedge assets.  While things are certainly different now, that hasn’t stopped rumors circulating that another winter could be around the corner. But how can anyone know for certain?  1. The crypto market then and now  Since the market has only experienced a single crypto winter in its history, one way to discern whether another winter is coming or not is to draw comparisons between the market back then and now.  The crypto winter of 2018 blew in immediately after bitcoin reached its then all-time high of $19,850 in December 2017, followed by the leading cryptocurrency’s price tanking 70% over the following 51 days.  It has now been 75 days since bitcoin fell from its new all-time high of $68,990 and has so far dropped as much as 52% from that record price. No obvious signs of a recovery have appeared.  Looking at the broader market as a whole, the global market capitalization – the sum of all cryptocurrency project market capitalizations – fell by 66% during the same 51-day period between late 2017 and early 2018, according to Coinmarketcap data.  By comparison, the current global crypto market capitalization has decreased 48% over the last 75 days.  Finally, taking into consideration that bitcoin plunged 84% before hitting bottom during the first crypto winter, it would mean that bitcoin’s current price would need to bottom out around $11,000 to reflect the same percentage loss.  This is, of course, a rough estimation for gauging where the current market stacks up against itself previously during the last crypto winter and should not be construed as concretely confirming or denying a new bearish cycle has started.  Read more: 4 Things to Do in a Crypto Bear Market  2. The mythical four-year crypto cycle  There’s a growing belief the crypto market (in more recent years) follows a pattern of rising and falling in price every four years. Whether this is the result of a self-fulfilling prophecy or not is difficult to say, however, many tie this theory to the timing of Bitcoin halving events, which occur roughly every four years (more specifically, every 210,000 blocks). This changes the dynamic of the market and ushers in a new market cycle – or so the story goes.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained  During each Bitcoin halving, the number of newly minted bitcoin given to successful miners as block rewards is cut in half – in the last halving event in 2020, the block reward was cut by 50% from 12.5 to 6.25. What’s most intriguing about these events is the repeated effect it seems to have on the crypto market approximately one year after each halving takes place.  A year after the 2016 halving, when bitcoin block rewards were slashed from 25 to 12.5 BTC, bitcoin – and most other cryptocurrencies in the market – printed new all-time highs. In 2021, one year after the next sequential halving took place, bitcoin and the broader crypto market recorded new all-time highs again.  This four-year gap between these two peaks has understandably caused some investors to fear the same gap rings true for crypto winters. And since 2018 was the last winter, it, theoretically, implies a second is due this year – assuming cycles will continue to follow the same four-year pattern.  But, again, it’s important to balance this with the maturity of the market now versus then, as well as other factors such as improved regulation, better-educated investors and a wider range of financial vehicles for gaining exposure to the crypto market indirectly.  3. Exacerbating macroeconomic factors  Indeed, a lot has changed since 2018, not merely in the cryptocurrency space but also throughout the global economy. Financial markets worldwide have been rocked by the first global pandemic crisis since 1918, the Federal Reserve is expected to hike interest rates for the first time in three years and inflation has reached levels in many countries not seen in decades. In addition, the total U.S. federal debt has doubled in the past decade to $28 trillion. Global authorities, who largely left cryptocurrencies alone for most of the industry's 13-year history, are now moving fast to catch up with new regulations and laws.  It’s entirely possible these events could curtail the frivolous investing we’ve seen from institutional and retail crypto investors alike over the last year, as borrowing becomes more expensive, and therefore less attractive, while the cost of living rises. In extension, this could provide the cooler climate necessary to initiate another winter in the crypto market.  Watch: Are We In a Crypto Winter?  That being said, it’s always important to understand the difference between sell-offs, crashes and crypto winters. While news headlines will often inflate the severity of crypto market movements, a vast majority of corrections in the crypto markets are simply sell-offs (a decline in price of approximately 5%-20%). Crashes can be characterized as 20%-50% declines, while crypto winters (going from the previous history) generally involve an 80%+ decline over an extended period of 10-12 months.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/is-a-crypto-winter-coming-3-things-to-consider,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29f54aa16d0af8994994f1c05bde1c151057de91-1883x1412.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396159,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0yNd,1643371488,Tokens Related to Wonderland Developer Plunge After QuadrigaCX Revelation,"Prices of tokens created by Daniele Sestagalli, one of the developers of Avalanche-based money market Wonderland, fell by as much as 22% in the past 24 hours amid drama around one of Wonderland’s co-founders.  In the past 24 hours, Popsicle Finance’s ICE fell 22%, Wonderland’s TIME fell 15% and Abracadabra’s SPELL dropped 15% to lead losses among altcoins in an otherwise sideways crypto market, data showed.  All these tokens were part of projects created by Sestagalli, who gained a cult following in recent months thanks to his community-centric approach towards crypto projects. His protocols were worth billions of dollars at their peak, but the fortunes have since faded away.  The price of TIME, one of the most popular Sestagalli projects, reached a low of $261 during U.S. hours on Thursday before recovering to $330 in European morning hours on Friday. The price is down 96% since lower all-time highs of just over $10,000 in November, when TIME reached a market capitalization of $2 billion.  SPELL, the governance token of Abracabadra, a protocol that allows investors to deposit collateral in the form of interest-bearing crypto, is down 86% since November’s peak of $0.03, data from tracking tool CoinGecko shows.  ICE, the token of Ethereum-based cross-chain exchange Popsicle Finance, fell from over $8 on Wednesday to $4 in European morning hours on Friday. Its market capitalization dropped to just over $50 million, a level last seen in September.  Investors were also concerned about Magic Internet Money (MIM), a dollar-pegged stablecoin issued on the Abracabadra Money platform, losing its parity with the U.S. dollar. MIM is one of the largest algorithmic stablecoins, with a circulating supply in excess of $4.6 billion at the time of writing.  QuadrigaCX tie led to the price plunge  The plunge came after Wonderland’s pseudonymous co-founder ""Sifu"" was revealed to be Michael Patryn, one of the co-founders of failed crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, as reported.  Patryn launched the influential Canadian crypto exchange with Gerard Cotten in 2013, with the exchange processing over $2 billion in trading volume at its peak in 2018. But the success story turned awry after Cotten died during a trip to India, taking with him access codes to wallets that controlled over $190 million worth of cryptocurrencies belonging to clients.  Conspiracy theories around Cotten’s death soon sprung up about the circumstances of his death. In addition, some investigations at the time revealed Patryn – who left Quadriga in 2016 – was actually one Omar Dhanani, a convicted felon who was involved in credit card scams and identity fraud.  On Thursday, the broader crypto community was furious as Sestagalli decided to continue keeping a convicted scammer as one of the key holders to a treasury worth hundreds of millions of dollars. This led to a sell-off in TIME and, later, a sell-off in cryptocurrencies related to TIME and its developers.  Meanwhile, a governance post on Wonderland forum created by community members on Jan.27 sought to remove Sifu as treasury manager of the protocol.  Over 83% of the community voted to ""replace Sifu"" at the time of writing, staking over 41,000 TIME tokens as votes towards the removal.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/28/tokens-related-to-wonderland-developer-plunge-after-quadrigacx-revelation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e9adbb9b70279e2cb04ca43b94a79b5961f2b64-1200x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since November, the bank noted, the total crypto market cap has fallen by around 40%. The slide is unique in that it was driven mainly by macroeconomic factors, or developments that were outside digital markets, it said.  Mainstream adoption can raise valuations but at the same time will also likely raise correlations with other financial market variables, which reduces the diversification benefits of holding digital assets, analysts led by Zach Pandl wrote in the note.  The decline in bitcoin was highly correlated to the “drawdown in low-profitability tech stocks"" and recent initial public offerings, which reacted negatively to the Federal Reserve’s move toward interest-rate increases, the report said.  Bitcoin is at the center of recent rotations across asset classes, Goldman said. Bitcoin is positively correlated with proxies for inflation risk and frontier technology equity sectors, and is negatively correlated with real interest rates and the value of the U.S. dollar.  Sharp falls in token prices resulted in liquidations and a decline in borrowing on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms – which use coins as collateral – much like in the traditional financial system, the bank noted.  Further development of blockchain technology, such as metaverse applications, may provide a “secular tailwind” for certain digital assets over time, but they won’t be “immune to macroeconomic forces” such as monetary tightening by central banks, the report said.

Whether they are paintings or sculptures, books or vinyl records, owning art as opposed to consuming art is viewed as astute and royal. Psychologically, it gives the owner a feeling of power to own a unique and rare art piece, and thus from exclusive painting exhibitions to limited book sales, people generally storm in with the hopes of getting involved. For years, exhibitions have been an essential source of selling paintings or sculptures to the end-users. However, the new wave of digital transformation has changed the industry. NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens have tied the crypto and art worlds together, allowing collectors ownership of digital art. NFTs work as a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on the blockchain. NFTs became a clear expansion of the industry, offering an adjunct to traditional art, thanks to its unique characteristic of transparency and ownership. The latest advent of the metaverse has transformed how digital art, through NFTs can be traded and displayed. While NFTs started as digital art, combining it with the metaverse means NFTs now serve as a digital asset that can be displayed in virtual reality, such as virtual art galleries, museums, or even incorporated into the scenery of any virtual landscape.

This stance highlights the opposing position of the Bank of Russia, which last week called for a full ban on crypto trading, mining and payments.  The road map, signed by the deputy chairman of the government, Dmitry Chernyshenko, according to RBK, suggests introducing know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules for cryptocurrency platforms, defining their regulatory status, mandating a supervisory body and establishing penalties for those who don't play by the rules.  The plan was drafted by a working group comprising several government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Development, General Prosecutor's Office, Rosfinmonitoring (the federal body responsible for combating money laundering and terrorist financing), Federal Tax Service, Ministry of Digital Development, Bank of Russia, Federal Security Service and Ministry of Interior.  The sole dissenting voice came from the Bank of Russia, which insists on a ban, according to an unidentified source cited by RBK.  The timetable says that by May the Ministry of Finance should have designed a system of compliance control for peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms. By November, anti-money laundering standards set by the global Financial Action Task Force (FATF) should be adopted. By December, rules for registration and reporting by crypto platforms should be created.  Failure to declare cryptocurrency transactions should be subject to administrative and criminal punishment, according to the document. There is also a plan to introduce a law for Russians to report their cryptocurrencies holdings. A method for defining crypto assets' prices also needs to be developed.  In recognition of its opposition, the Bank of Russia will be assigned to study how China banned crypto.  The Ministry of Finance had earlier put forward its own proposal for regulating crypto in the country. That plan included making banks responsible for the KYC procedures and limited non-qualified investors' ability to trade complex investment instruments, RBK previously reported.  Compliance procedures should be based on the ones employed by Aximetria, a Swiss crypto startup with Russian roots recently purchased by Russia's Tinkoff bank, according to the publication. Transactions would be traced by Rosfinmonitoring, the AML watchdog, through its homemade transaction tracking tool called Transparent Blockchain.

WMG defined its new home as a &apos;combination of musical theme park and concert arena&apos; in a press release. Concerts and other &apos;musical experiences&apos; will be hosted in collaboration with The Sandbox. But it&apos;s only talked about one thing so far: a special sale of digital real estate dubbed Land, which Sandbox members can purchase &apos;coveted&apos; pieces of in March. The Sandbox has already collaborated on experiences with specific artists such as Snoop Dogg, but this appears to be a larger and more ambitious project. &apos;Warner Music has secured the metaverse&apos;s equivalent of beachfront property,&apos; boasted Oana Ruxandra, WMG&apos;s chief digital officer of business development. The Land sale will include areas next to the WMG property, though WMG did not explain whether this will provide any tangible benefits or if buyers will simply derive emotional satisfaction — and potentially higher real estate prices — from the abstract sense of proximity. The Sandbox&apos;s Land sales have precedent in virtual worlds such as Second Life, where firms have opened virtual experiences as well. Virtual concerts have also taken over Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox, with the latter signing its own music business deals and hosting &apos;listening parties&apos; where artists may showcase new music.

According to BSCscan, the address connected to the hack has over 206,809 BNB worth over $80 million.

6870,http://blokt.com/?p=39495,1643367320,ExpressVPN vs Private Internet Access (PIA),"Virtual Private Networks offer exceptional levels of security and privacy to browse the internet anonymously. Using an encrypted internet connection from your computer to a network ensures the confidentiality of any sensitive data transmitted over the internet. In addition, it keeps unauthorized people from spying on your internet traffic and allows you to work remotely . Which is better: ExpressVPN or Private Internet Access? Find out below! There are many popular VPN providers available today. This review discusses two phenomenally popular VPN services: Private Internet Access, otherwise known as PIA, and ExpressVPN . We’ll compare their features and focus on categories such as privacy, security, pricing, performance, and more. Get ExpressVPN Get PIA Private Internet Access Features vs. ExpressVPN Features Two of the most popular VPN providers available today are Private Internet Access (PIA) and Express VPN . But, first, let’s look at some of their features and see how they compare to each other. Private Internet Access (PIA) PIA offers a lot of features essential to your internet security . However, unlike ExpressVPN, PIA chose the United States as its base. This location may be considered harmful in terms of data retention laws . While the US doesn’t have a mandatory law on data retention , it shouldn’t be surprising to find out that the government can obtain access to any stored data under the SCA or Stored Communications Act . PIA is smart, however, and doesn’t keep user logs . PIA – Protect your privacy with a VPN Tunnel This VPN also provides vital features for anonymity, such as DNS protection and a Kill Switch . PIA also ensures a better browsing experience by supplying protection from malware and ads . We all know how annoying ads are and how dangerous malware is, so these are great features to have . PIA offers OpenVPN, which many consider the securest protocol of all . Private Internet Access also gives you the option to choose your preferred level of encryption . In addition, it includes port forwarding, a common technique that redirects computer signals between the internet and LAN computers. PIA has apps for Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, and iOS. It provides cost-efficient high performance. Pros of PIA Features DNS Leak Protection Kill Switch Port Forwarding Options to Choose Encryption Level Protection against trackers, malware, ads Why should you use PIA? Cons of PIA Features Location Fewer Server Locations Get PIA Recommended PIA VPN Service Get It ExpressVPN Some say that ExpressVPN picked a better location by utilizing the British Virgin Islands because there are no data retention laws. We agree, for us, privacy is of paramount importance. However, you need to be in the right jurisdiction for the ultimate privacy. A government that isn’t infamous for snooping won’t ask for the information, and if it did, ExpressVPN has no legal responsibility to comply . Location is a plus in this aspect. Even if PIA doesn’t keep user logs, a site further away from the UK or US adds an extra security layer. ExpressVPN – Amplify the Entire Internet Like PIA, ExpressVPN offers Kill Switch and DNS Leak Prevention as well as IPv6 Leak Protection . ExpressVPN has a server speed test integrated into its software and it allows you to automatically or manually choose a server. While PIA has more servers, ExpressVPN has more locations for its servers , which is excellent because it increases the number of available locations users can choose from nearby. This feature is critical since you should choose a server in a different country but one that is still close. Just make sure to look at the server list since this can change for every user. ExpressVPN has apps for macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, Amazon Fire TV, and Android. It also has great 24/7 live customer support through chat. ExpressVPN has become such a trusted and reliable VPN operator that global computer hardware and software manufacturer HP have officially partnered with ExpressVPN to offer their customers internet privacy solutions. As a result, since late 2019, all HP computers have come pre-loaded with ExpressVPN. And it is always either 1 or 2 on our top VPN lists. Besides Nordvpn (our top choice), we would say it is one of the best VPNs in the world today. Pros of ExpressVPN Features Location Integrated Server Speed Test Kill Switch Servers in 94 Countries Split Tunneling Cons of ExpressVPN Features Fewer Servers No Additional Protection from Ads and Malware Get ExpressVPN Recommended ExpressVPN VPN Service Get It Speed, Reliability, and Performance First, PIA has high performance at a low cost, while ExpressVPN has great unblocking capabilities . Many experts consider ExpressVPN more ideal to use with home-based routers. PIA’s blocking of trackers, ads, and malware certainly enhances the experience and performance. The unlimited bandwidth also contributes to its quality performance. ExpressVPN’s split tunneling enhances performance by allowing you to route some of your traffic through a VPN while directing the rest through the internet. It has over 160 server locations in those 94 countries previously mentioned which also boosts its performance. ExpressVPN Split Tunneling Both have great performance at high speeds . ExpressVPN claims to have incredibly-fast VPN speeds, and remember it has that integrated speed test to help you choose the fastest server in your network. PIA says it has gigabit VPN port speeds and unmetered VPN transfer . Reviewers testing the speed loss on both networks’ VPNs found a 7 percent loss of speed with ExpressVPN, and PIA has an 11 percent speed loss . PIA and ExpressVPN are known for their reliability and quality. It’s why they are so popular. You can’t go wrong with a fast VPN tunnel connection. Both of these VPNs are very reliable . You can enjoy content from blocked and censored websites from virtually anywhere in the world. In the world of peer-to-peer downloads, both ExpressVPN and PIA are among the highest-rated VPNs for torrenting . Get ExpressVPN Get PIA Security and Privacy ExpressVPN protects your data with 256-bit AES encryption. Use one of ExpressVPN’s secure servers to mask your true location and IP address . It lets you browse anonymously , and you can even use this VPN with Tor for extra security and privacy online. ExpressVPN also lets you pay with Bitcoin , which is still a rarity and brings its own privacy benefits. Also, there is no need to worry about your private data being shared as ExpressVPN doesn’t ever log DNS queries, traffic data, or any identifying information . Privacy and Security Your ability to choose your own VPN protocol or let ExpressVPN select one for you is an excellent security feature . Also, ExpressVPN operates its own encrypted and private DNS on every server guaranteeing you faster and safer connections. PIA has a lot of great security features as well . The fact that it doesn’t keep traffic logs make up for its location in the US. The malware, tracker, and ad blocking also serve as critical security and privacy functions. PIA allows you to enable Wi-Fi security with their service and use a hidden IP to browse anonymously . Utilizing anonymous VPN tunnels is one of the securest ways to protect your privacy. Your PIA VPN account is secure and safe . Price ExpressVPN and PIA both have three different subscription plans . They have very different pricing terms, however. The subscription periods for ExpressVPN are 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year while PIA’s periods are 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years . ExpressVPN costs $12.95 a month . If you choose a 6-month plan billed every 6 months the price per month lowers to $9.99 . A 12-month plan paid yearly brings the cost per month down to just $8.32 . ExpressVPN accepts credit card payments, such as Visa and Mastercard, electronic payment options such as Bitcoin and Alipay, but users can also pay for their subscription in Bitcoin if they are particularly privacy-focused. ExpressVPN Pricing Plans PIA costs just $9.95 a month if you choose its monthly option. The cost lowers to $5.99 a month if you pick the yearly option and if you decide on PIA’s 2-year plan, the price equals just $3.49 a month . PIA Pricing Plans Both companies offer a money-back guarantee . PIA’s is only 7 days while ExpressVPN’s is 30 days . Each company offers discounts with certain subscriptions, such as the steep discount for purchasing their highest plans . PIA provides a 58 percent discount on its 2-year plan . In addition to the discounts that ExpressVPN gives for buying a longer-term plan, it offers 3 months free with its annual subscription . Private Internet Access lets users pay for their subscription through traditional methods, such as credit card, but also allow users to pay using PayPal, Google Play, and iTunes. PIA also has Bitcoin and Ripple payment options – but this is only available for one-time purchases and not subscriptions. Get ExpressVPN Get PIA The Verdict The choice of which one of these VPNs is the best can be difficult. They both have excellent security features and pricing plans . Each company offers something that the other one doesn’t. Even though PIA is less expensive for a fantastic VPN service, the choice for the best VPN goes to ExpressVPN . Several factors led us to this choice. First, the company location is a significant asset. It is based in the British Virgin Islands, which is about as good a location you can get. Although PIA doesn’t keep logs, it is still based in the USA, which is a major disadvantage in our opinion. If you are very concerned with privacy when choosing a VPN then we always recommend looking at jurisdiction before anything else. Even without jurisdiction, Expressvpn still comes out on top. ExpressVPN has the most server locations. It has excellent speed and less speed loss than PIA. It may be more expensive, but its service is still excellent value for the price. Verdict – Source: Shitterstock.com ExpressVPN also has a 30-day money-back guarantee . The company gives you 3 months free if you sign up for the longest subscription which is an excellent incentive. ExpressVPN also has some great educational features on navigating VPNs . There are step-by-step how-to privacy guides on anonymous browsing. Its blog provides awesome information on digital freedom , security tips , and global internet privacy news . It even has guides on how to stream your favorite sports online . And when it comes to streaming, ExpressVPN also happens to be one of the most best VPNs for Netflix . Note: You can also read our ExpressVPN review if you would like a more detailed rundown on what this VPN service can offer. The critical thing when choosing the right VPN for you lies in the specific features that you need . No matter which one you select, make sure that you find out about its server locations and other pertinent information before you make your choice.

Polygon (previously Matic Network) is the first well-organized and user-friendly platform to support Ethereum infrastructure development and scaling. The core component of the platform is the Polygon SDK, a modular, flexible framework that can be used to build different kinds of applications. Polygon effectively converts Ethereum into a fully-fledged Multi-chain System. The multi-chain system is similar to others like Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche, and so on. Let us move ahead to read about Polygon technical analysis. Past Performance of MATIC The MATIC coin price shows a growth of more than 5% in the past 24 hours despite a previous higher price rejection candle. The price action maintains a sideways movement between $1.5 and $1.75. The recent long-range candles indicate increased trend volatility in the short term as buyers struggle to regain trend control.

42375411,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7hod,1643355959,Bitcoin Worth $670M Leaves Centralized Exchanges After Hawkish Fed Comments,"Crypto investors seem to have stepped up bitcoin accumulation, shrugging off prospects of faster interest-rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Blockchain data provided by Glassnode shows that more than 18,000 bitcoin worth $670 million left centralized exchanges on Thursday, registering the biggest single-day net outflow in over a month. Crypto exchange BitMEX alone saw net outflow of over 9,500 bitcoins.  Most investors prefer to have direct custody of coins when they intend to hold them for a longer term. Thus, net outflows are widely taken to represent bullish sentiment.  Outflows do not necessarily imply passive investing and investors often tokenize coins drained from centralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain to earn extra yield. The number of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) has increased by 13,000 this year, extending the year-long rising trend. WBTC is the first ERC-20 token backed 1:1 with bitcoin and represents the top cryptocurrency on the Ethereum network.  Whatever the case, increased outflows mean fewer coins available for sale on exchanges and a better chance of the market going up.  On Wednesday, the Fed, through the Federal Open Market Committee. set the stage for a more aggressive withdrawal of liquidity to tame high inflation. The Fed fund futures have now priced in five rate hikes of 0.25% each for 2022, up from four ahead of Wednesday's FOMC meeting.  Bitcoin and other risk assets with fortunes tied to centralized liquidity are likely to remain under pressure with the Fed focused on fighting inflation, analysts told CoinDesk.

The Subversive Metaverse ETF, which launched on Thursday, will invest in companies in the United States and abroad that are involved in constructing immersive digital worlds. According to Subversive Capital LLC, Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s company is too poisonous in terms of reputation to be the standard-bearer for the virtual-reality explosion.

The team is currently working with security and network partners on next steps,” developers said in a tweet.  Addresses connected to the attack show 206,809 Binance coins (BNB) were drained from Qubit’s QBridge protocol. The assets are worth over $80 million at current prices, security firm PeckShield confirmed in a tweet.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) projects like Qubit Finance rely on smart contracts instead of third parties to offer users financial services such as trading, lending and borrowing.  Qubit allows users to supply their crypto holdings to the protocol and borrow loans against this collateral for a fixed fee. QBridge is a cross-chain feature that enables users to collateralize their assets on other networks without moving assets from one chain to another.  PeckShield, which audited Qubit’s smart contracts, said the QBridge was hacked to mint a “huge amount of xETH collateral” that was then used to drain the entire amount of BNB held on QBridge.  In an incident report, security firm CertiK said the attacker used a deposit function in the QBridge contract and illicitly minted 77,162 qXETH, an asset that represents ether bridged via Qubit. Attackers tricked the protocol to show that they had deposited funds without making an actual deposit.  These steps were repeated several times, and the attacker then converted all the assets to BNB, CertiK said in a tweet.  The exploit is the seventh-largest attack on a DeFi protocol by the amount of funds stolen, as per data from analytics tool DeFi Yield.  Qubit’s QBT is down 25% in the past 24 hours, as per data from CoinGecko. Much of the fall occurred after this morning’s incident was made public.

BSTX is aiming for immediate or accelerated settlement (T+0 or T+1) thanks to the transactions taking place on the blockchain. It will also provide market data recorded on the blockchain in a process similar to an Oracle. This will be done via a blockchain run by BSTX, the company said.  The exchange will be open to both retail and institutional investors.  BOX has been trying to get SEC approval for some sort of exchange since 2020. The first iteration of the application was for a Security Token Offering (STO) platform.  In 2020, the SEC declined BOX's application to record end-of-day securities ownership balances and other trading data to the Ethereum blockchain.  “The SEC has taken an important step forward today in its approval of BSTX as a national securities exchange,” BSTX CEO Lisa Fall said in a statement. “We are eager to continue to work closely with the SEC to launch a fully regulated new exchange and to help provide capital markets with more modern tools for issuers and investors.”  BSTX said it is working to eventually support regulated crypto markets alongside its equity offerings.  In a release, the SEC said the approval is conditional on BSTX joining relevant national market system plans. These are structures set up for the dissemination of real-time market information. The SEC will also require BSTX to be part of an intermarket surveillance group, which is an industry working group used to coordinate regulatory compliance.  “Today’s approval is only the start for BSTX.

42375419,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7hyh,1643335852,DeFi Users Fret ‘Contagion’ Risk Amid Possible Stablecoin Depegging,"A scandal has rocked investor faith in a popular stablecoin; as users rush to exit, the clamor is threatening to throw the asset off its dollar peg.  Even worse, some observers worry that one stablecoin losing its peg could have a “contagion” effect, diminishing the value of multiple stablecoin assets.  On Thursday, popular on-chain analyst zachXBT revealed on Twitter that the pseudonymous chief financial officer of decentralized finance (DeFi) project Wonderland was in fact Michael Patryn, the co-founder of the notorious and fraudulent Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX.  Read more: How Did a Former Quadriga Exec End Up Running a DeFi Protocol? Wonderland Founder Explains  The revelation pushed the price of Wonderland’s TIME as much as 40% lower on the day, and investors have likewise been fleeing Popsicle Finance and Abracadabra, a pair of projects also run by Wonderland lead Daniele Sestagalli.  Abracadabra’s MIM algorithmic stablecoin is among the victims of the crisis in confidence, with users fleeing Curve pools for the asset that are popular among yield farmers. The ensuing low liquidity briefly pushed MIM off its dollar peg on Curve throughout the day.  This, in turn, has thrown Terra’s UST stablecoin into flux. In addition to a MIM-UST Curve pool linking the assets, Abracadabra offers a “degenbox” product that allows for leveraged yield farming with deposits into UST – a dynamic that means MIM is heavily collateralized with UST.  According to semi-anonymous Curve core contributor Charlie, this creates a potentially dangerous link where if one of these stablecoins falter, the other will, in turn.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Charlie said that while Thursday’s events have tested the peg of each stablecoin, both have thus far withstood the volatility.  Wavering peg  According to Charlie, Thursday’s stablecoin volatility is due to investors running for the exits.  “People in the Curve pools have the choice to withdraw their liquidity from the pool in one coin, and that’s what we’re seeing now – a lot of people withdrawing to coins that aren’t UST or MIM,” he said.  Indeed, major liquidity providers, such as crypto investment firm Alameda Research, have moved to withdraw liquidity from Curve pools in the past 12 hours. On-chain analysts noted that Alameda unwound a $500 million position on Thursday evening, and the amount of liquidity in the UST-MIM pool on the Ethereum mainnet has halved since Thursday morning to $230 million at the time of writing.  During a brief flash crash Thursday evening, the MIM-3pool reserves were just $40 million in USDC/DAI/USDT for $1.2 billion in MIM (down from a near-even $1.3 billion to $1.3 billion split on Tuesday), causing a depegging that bled over to UST.  “MIM, because it’s backing is so much UST, it’s essentially pegged to it, so the dip that Alameda just caused a few minutes ago, it means UST comes down with MIM,” said Charlie of the relation.  However, there are incentive-based stabilization mechanisms for the assets that so far have held up under the strain of major liquidity providers withdrawing.  According to Charlie, if users deposit 3pool stablecoins (USDC/DAI/USDT) into Curve when MIM or UST are depegged from a dollar price, the timing grants the users a “bonus” to their positions.  Likewise, users can withdraw MIM or UST from the Curve pools and redeem for their collateral on Terra or Abracadabra, which always treats their value as $1, giving them a bonus on redemption if the assets are unpegged.  “These mechanisms are enticing for liquidity providers who want to take the other side of that trade,” said Charlie.  Contagion contained  While some observers following the asset peg saga are worried UST and MIM could serve as a “contagion” that destabilizes other pools on Curve, Charlie said that the current likelihood of the volatility expanding beyond MIM and UST appears low.  “So far, on the hard dips we’ve seen it didn’t seem to affect the other stablecoins. If anything, people are running away from MIM and UST and to other stablecoins,” he said.  He added that the core Curve team has been discussing contagion “quite extensively” throughout the day, but at the moment their concerns are concentrated on the MIM and UST pools.  “When the day started I didn’t think it would get this bad, but it did, and so far things are holding up okay,” he concluded.

42375417,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7huv,1643330268,House Bill Could Let Treasury Secretary Block International Crypto Transactions,"The crypto industry is sounding the alarm at the possibility the U.S. will be empowering the Treasury Department to make arbitrary decisions about whether to allow financial transactions – including cryptocurrency transactions across borders.  A provision in the America COMPETES Act, a bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this week, would allow the Treasury secretary to block or “impose conditions” on transactions, should the official find the transaction or the accounts involved are engaged in money laundering.  The overall bill is aimed at spurring economic competitiveness with China.  Industry think tank Coin Center warned in a blog post that the bill could allow the Treasury secretary to block all U.S. financial institutions from interacting with a crypto exchange, jurisdiction that has crypto exchanges, crypto transactions validated by a non-U.S. miner or non-custodial wallets.  “In brief, it would hand the Treasury secretary unchecked discretion to forbid financial institutions (including cryptocurrency exchanges) from offering their customers access to cryptocurrency networks. The secretary may not use this discretion immediately, but it is not power the Department should have,” the blog post said.  The Treasury secretary already has this power in limited quantities. Under existing law, the regulator, in consultation with the Federal Reserve chairman, secretary of state, federal regulators and other agencies can impose these restrictions on transactions. However, a public rulemaking notice must be issued alongside the restriction, and the restriction will lift after 120 days unless the Treasury Department implements a rule continuing the block after the comment period.  The new provision would remove the comment period and 120-day expiration, Coin Center said, in addition to explicitly adding digital assets to the types of financial transactions that the Treasury Secretary can restrict.  The provision highlights “innovations in financial services” that make it easier to send funds across borders, “particularly through digital assets” that make it easier for criminals to transfer funds (though the bill also concedes that digital assets may be “useful to legitimate consumers.”  “Ransomware attacks on U.S. companies requiring payments in cryptocurrencies have increased in recent years, with the U.S. Treasury [Dept.] estimating that ransomware payments in the United States reached $590 million in just the first half of 2021, compared to a total of $416 million in 2020,” according to the authors of the bill.  The provision was introduced by Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) and resembles a similar provision he tried to attach to last year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a must-pass bill that funds the U.S. military. The provision was stripped out of the bill at the time.  A press statement announcing the provision said it “streamlines the process by which special measures may be introduced and modernizes the authorities granted to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) by allowing the agency to pursue bad actors like those laundering the proceeds of Chinese ransomware and or declared a Primary Money Laundering Concern due to support to North Korea’s sanctions evasion.”  CoinDesk has reached out to Himes’ office for comment.  Lawmakers are already trying to block the provision from being passed. Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) introduced an amendment that would simply remove the provision altogether.  Still, even if the provision passes the House, its path to becoming law is unclear.  In order to become a law, the provision needs a counterpart in the Senate version of the bill, the Endless Frontier Act. At the moment, no such counterpart exists.  After the Senate and House pass their respective versions, the bills will go to a conference committee, where representatives from the House and Senate will iron out the differences between the two versions.  CoinDesk understands there has not been any work by House leadership yet to ensure this provision ends up in the Senate version of the bill.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/28/house-bill-could-let-treasury-secretary-block-international-crypto-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d52e218544555b934b3bd4fe5d96c819566b99f-5405x3603.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375416,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7hwB,1643328396,Warren Targets 6 More Crypto Miners for Their Energy Use,"U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) expanded her inquiry of bitcoin miners’ energy usage and their environmental footprint, sending letters to six more miners on Thursday.  Warren wrote to Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital Holdings, Stronghold Digital Mining, Bitdeer Group, Bitfury Group and Bit Digital, questioning their “extraordinarily high energy usage.”  In December, Warren, who has made environmental issues a focus of her office, sent a letter to the bitcoin miner Greenidge Generation, expressing her concerns about its high energy usage.  In the new letter, Warren and her colleagues asked each miner to detail its electricity consumption, scaling plans, agreements with electricity companies and impact on energy costs for consumers and small businesses by Feb. 10.  “The extraordinarily high energy usage and carbon emissions associated with Bitcoin mining could undermine our hard work to tackle the climate crisis – not to mention the harmful impacts crypto mining has on local environments and electricity prices,” Warren said in the letter.  The correspondence adds to a list of inquiries by lawmakers globally on the energy consumption of proof-of-work (PoW) mechanisms that reward crypto miners for validating transactions. Most recently, the U.S. held a congressional hearing to discuss the energy consumption related to the PoW. Meanwhile, the European Union's markets regulator called for a ban on the validation system, citing its energy intensity.  ""We are encouraged to see that they are interested in learning more about Marathon and the broader bitcoin mining industry, and we welcome the opportunity to participate in the educational process,"" said Charlie Schumacher, Marathon's director of corporate communications in an email to CoinDesk. ""We look forward to having a productive dialogue about the many benefits that we and the rest of our industry have for the United States,"" he added.  ""As a company that is first and foremost tackling a legacy environmental problem left over from the coal industry, any discussion that sheds light on the impact facing Pennsylvanians in relation to their water, land and community is important to us,"" said a spokesperson for Stronghold Digital, a bitcoin miner who converts coal waste across Pennsylvania into power for mining operations.  Stronghold has received bipartisan support within Pennsylvania and its two facilities, Scrubgrass and Panther Creek, will convert a total of 1.25 million tons of waste coal to alternative energy annually, the company spokesperson said, adding that Stronghold welcomes any dialogue on the environmental issues with Senator Warren and her colleagues.  Meanwhile, another mining company targeted by Warren, Bit Digital, also welcomed talks with the lawmakers, noting that the company has taken a ""leadership role"" to achieve energy sustainability within the crypto mining sector. ""We welcome this sort of high-level dialogue with policymakers in Washington and at all levels of government, and look forward to responding to this inquiry in a timely and informative manner,” said Bryan Bullett, CEO of Bit Digital.  The willingness to engage with policymakers was also echoed by Riot Blockchain. ""We look forward to thoroughly reviewing and earnestly responding to the requested information in the letter we received from the Senate,"" the company's spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Other two companies didn't immediately respond to request for comments.  UPDATE (Jan. 28, 2022, 17:40 p.m. UTC): Adds comments from Marathon, Stronghold and Bit Digital.
