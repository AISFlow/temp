18160506,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553353,1695942043,What Is Behind The 16% PEPE Price Recovery And Will It Continue?,"Over the last week, the PEPE price has emerged as one of the best performers in the crypto market. This followed a long period of drawdown that dragged the meme coin’s price almost 90% below its June 2023 all-time high. This prolonged bear period coupled with its declining momentum is why the price reversal has caught the market by surprise. Social Discussions Around PEPE Rise To figure out why the PEPE price has been on a rally at a time when the broader crypto market has suffered declines, let’s take a look at the social discussions around the token. In particular, a report from on-chain tracker Santiment shows the social media discussion trends of top meme coins. Related Reading: Factors That Suggest A Recovery For The ADA Price Santiment’s report which was shared on X (formerly Twitter) points out that meme coins have not really been on the radar of traders, except for PEPE. As the chart shows, discussions around the PEPE meme token saw an uptick this week. PEPE sees uptick in discussions | Source: Santiment on X It is the only meme coin whose social media discussions rose during the week with the likes of Dogecoin seeing their own metrics drop to 3-year lows. This uptick could present the reason behind the PEPE price recovery this week. Usually, when investors start getting interested in a coin, they will often talk about it on social media platforms. Depending on whether investors are collectively bullish or bearish, it can cause a swing in the price toward either direction. In this case, the uptick in discussions coincides with the rise in price, suggesting a higher level of bullishness. PEPE Price Rises 16% In One Week PEPE’s double-digit surge this week saw the altcoin hit a local peak of $0.00000075 on Wednesday, resulting in one of its highest levels in September 2023. This rally has since lost momentum but the meme coin continues to maintain a good chunk of its gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Barrels Past $5.2 Billion, Is It Time To Buy? The PEPE price is up more than 16% on the weekly chart and enjoying a 92% surge in its daily trading volume over the last 24 hours. This increase in trading volume also shines a light on the rising investor interest, which could suggest a continuation of the rally once the correction finds a bottom. However, with most of the crypto market still deeply in the throes of the bear market, it’s unlikely that the rally would be able to continue for too long, presenting a hindrance. If the coin fails to establish support above $0.00000071, then all of this week’s gains could be wiped out by the time the weekend is over.

18158999,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553408,1695938411,"Is The Ethereum Winter Over? L2 Exploding, ETH Futures ETF Launches","After sinking roughly 30% from 2023 highs, Ethereum appears to be bouncing off from the pits of the crypto winter. Looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily and weekly charts, the coin has primary support at around $1,500 and is firm, bouncing off with decent trading volume. At spot rates, ETH is up approximately 3% following positive developments sparked by the increasing adoption of its layer-2 scaling solution and the recent news that VanEck, a player managing billions of assets, is preparing to launch an Ethereum derivatives product. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions Exploding Taking to X on September 28, Alex Masmej, the founder of Showtime, believes that Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem has expanded to such an extent that it no “longer makes sense to build on other platforms.” The development and deployment of Ethereum layer-2 solutions took center stage following network congestion, which forced gas fees to spike to record highs in the last bull run. Developers have responded to the network co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s urging. The expert believes they are quickly constructing and deploying safe, universal platforms that have gained widespread popularity. Related Reading: Report Reveals Crypto Whale Center With Majority Of Transactions Crossing $1 Million Layer-2 platforms bundle transactions off-chain before confirming them on-chain, allowing for faster and more cost-effective operations while benefiting from the security of Ethereum. As of September 28, there were over 827,000 validators whose job is to confirm transactions and ensure that the network is secure, thanks in part to their geographic distribution. Most layer-2 solutions use optimistic rollups, including Arbitrum, Base, and OP Mainnet. However, Masmej also said that once ZK rollups, which utilize zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions without revealing sensitive data, are available, it will end the scalability trilemma, further boosting the capabilities of layer-2 solutions. Related Reading: Research Firm Reveals Its “Altcoin Trading Playbook” In the founder’s assessment, high throughput options, including Solana, will be a hedge. At the same time, Cosmos, which drives blockchain interoperability, will act as a long-term source of inspiration. Meanwhile, Ethereum will continue to flourish as Layer-2 options gain traction. Rising TVL And ETH Complex Products Launching According to l2Beat data, popular solutions like Arbitrum and Base, which offer faster and cheaper processing environments while remaining coupled with Ethereum and enjoying the pioneer network’s fast-move advantage, have larger total value locked (TVL). As of September 28, layer-2 platforms have a TVL of over $10.6 billion, more than Solana’s market cap, which stood at $8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Beyond layer-2 adoption, ETH is being catalyzed by the news that VanEck, a global asset manager, is preparing to introduce its Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). Specifically, the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) will invest in ETH futures contracts provided by exchanges approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Like the Bitcoin Futures ETF product, which is already being offered, the Ethereum derivative product will allow institutions to gain exposure, boosting liquidity.

18157384,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553400,1695934851,ETH Price Rally On The Horizon: Ether Futures ETFs Poised For October 3 Approval,"In an unexpected turn of events, Ethereum (ETH) Futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are drawing closer to fruition, potentially becoming available for trading as early as October 3, which could be a significant catalyst for ETH price. Renowned Bloomberg ETF expert Erich Balchunas recently shared insights indicating that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might expedite its approval process to avoid potential disruptions caused by a looming government shutdown. SEC Considers Fast-Tracking Ether ETFs A government shutdown, which could go into effect if Congress and President Biden fail to reach an agreement on a budget or a short-term continuing resolution by September 30, entails suspending most federal government functions. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP Price Receive Boost Following This Coinbase Announcement The implications of a shutdown extend beyond its duration, as services provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may experience disruptions and delays, affecting citizens both during the shutdown and while federal agencies strive to regain momentum once it ends. NBC reports that a government shutdown is increasingly likely if Congress does not take swift action. While Congress convened on Wednesday, progress in breaking the impasse has been limited. President Joe Biden expressed optimism, stating that a shutdown is not inevitable and urging House Republicans to fulfill their responsibilities by funding the government. In light of these developments, Erich Balchunas believes that recent actions taken by the SEC indicate its intention to expedite decision-making processes, as evidenced by the postponement of several spot Bitcoin ETFs weeks ahead of schedule. To potentially preempt the impact of an impending shutdown, the SEC may aim to accelerate the launch schedule for Ethereum ETFs. If this occurs, ETF issuers would likely need to submit their final prospectus this week to allow for an effective launch as early as October 2. Supporting Balchunas’ perspective, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart concurred: Nothing yet but watching for filings to indicate Ethereum Futures ETFs are indeed being accelerated for launch next week. We expect a lot more filings from the SEC today as they continue to clear their desks as much as possible before the shut down. Normalcy is out the window These updates reinforce the notion that Ether futures ETFs are likely to receive approval immediately, aligning with a recent Bloomberg report that posited a 90% chance of their launch in October. However, until the SEC officially announces its decision, the crypto community remains on tenterhooks, eagerly anticipating the potential groundbreaking debut of Ether Futures ETFs by October 3. ETH Price Shows Resilience With Upward Momentum Ethereum (ETH) has exhibited a significant upward movement in the past week, marking a positive trend extending into the past 24 hours. Over the past seven days, ETH has recorded a gain of over 4%, while within the last 24 hours, it has seen a rise of more than 3%. As of the latest update, ETH is currently trading at $1,662. This notable surge in price comes at a crucial juncture, with the monthly close approaching. Related Reading: Under-The-Radar Altcoin Soars Over 260% – Here’s Why A favorable outcome for Ethereum in these time frames could potentially set the stage for bullish price action in October, particularly with the prospective approval of Ether Futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Although breaking the overall downtrend structure has proven challenging for bullish investors, a close above the $1,650 mark would position the cryptocurrency favorably for a bullish October. This is a critical resistance level to overcome, and surpassing it would instill renewed optimism in the market.

42392463,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6ztD,1695934800,U.S. House Bill Seeks Centralized Record of Off-Chain Crypto Transactions,"U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat, wants to push off-chain crypto transaction data into repositories where regulators can see it, potentially heading off a future FTX.  A Democratic crypto bill at this stage may have a hard time catching up with the leading House legislation from majority Republicans, and the Senate may be even less hospitable.  It would be hard for a big exchange to repeat an FTX collapse if the firm’s internal flow of crypto assets was also reported to an outside repository that U.S. regulators could see. That’s the idea behind new legislation from Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) that would force exchanges to share the movement of digital assets now only recorded on their own ledgers.  A lot of the day-to-day transactions from crypto investors happen only internally at the handful of major exchanges, recorded by the companies rather than on public blockchains, but this bill would call for regulated repositories to gather the data for each trade of a “digital commodity, digital asset, or digital collectible” for use by agencies including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Beyer has been in talks with Republicans in the hope he could merge his idea for crypto data repositories into their market-structure bill that’s already in motion, according to a person familiar with the discussions. His office has also reached out to the Senate, which is so far looking like a brick wall for allowing major crypto legislation – this or anything else – in this session.  “As consumers increasingly turn to large digital asset trading platforms to conduct their business, thousands of transactions each day are conducted off the publicly verifiable blockchain,” Beyer said in a Thursday statement. “Unfortunately, internal record keeping among these private entities can vary wildly, and this can leave investors and consumers vulnerable to fraud and manipulation.”  Crypto data repositories would mirror what was done in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 to swaps trading information after that sector played a central role in the biggest financial disaster in a generation.  Beyer is the top House Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, but he’s not sitting on the House Financial Services or Agriculture committees that would be likely to shepherd crypto legislation. The financial panel, chaired by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) has made more crypto progress than in past years, already clearing a number of industry-related bills through his committee, including the market-structure bill that could be a home for Beyer’s idea if Republicans were receptive.  Republicans control the House and have their own crypto agenda they’re working through, and they’ve shown a willingness to press forward on bills without wide bipartisan support. The bill from Beyer – who was among the earliest lawmakers to attempt comprehensive crypto legislation with a bill two years ago that failed to advance – represents a complex and costly action that would shine a light on digital assets platforms’ inner workings, so it’s uncertain whether crypto-friendly Republicans will look favorably on it.

42392477,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg70xt,1695931717,Here's the Sam Bankman-Fried Trial Schedule,"Sam Bankman-Fried's trial is scheduled to start on Oct. 3, but the actual opening arguments are projected to begin a day later, a newly released court trial calendar shows.  The document, posted to the public court docket on Thursday, shows that while most of October and the first week of November are dedicated to the trial, the court will not be in session between Oct. 20 and Oct. 25. Nov. 3 will also be a day off, as will Oct. 9 and Nov. 10 – both of which are public holidays.  The trial days are marked as shaded days. The non-shaded days list the visiting hours for the Metropolitan Detention Center, where Bankman-Fried is currently detained.  During a hearing earlier Thursday, Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the trial, asked the prosecution and defense to estimate how long they expect their respective cases to last. Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Kudla said the Department of Justice estimated their case taking four to five weeks. Mark Cohen, representing Bankman-Fried, said the defense's case was more streamlined and -- if the defense chooses to present a case -- they could take up to a week and a half.  The calendar might be extended as a result, the judge noted, but in any event the consensus seems to be that the trial will end by Thanksgiving in late November.  During that same hearing, the judge denied a defense motion to have Bankman-Fried temporarily released for the duration of the trial. The onetime FTX executive has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.  The trial will kick off at 9:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday, when voir dire begins.

This achievement positions Valkyrie as the frontrunner among nine issuers seeking to provide investors with an opportunity to speculate on the future price of the world’s second-largest digital asset through an ETF. Related Reading: Research Firm Reveals Its “Altcoin Trading Playbook” Valkyrie Emerges As First Mover In Ethereum Futures ETF Race Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, currently holds a value of approximately $1,659 per token. Valkyrie aims to enhance retail participation in the crypto market by introducing an ETF that tracks Ether futures. According to FOX, Valkyrie Investments plans to merge its existing Bitcoin (BTC) futures ETF with the newly introduced Ether futures ETF, creating a combined fund named “the Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF”. Notably, the ETF’s Nasdaq ticker, BTF, will remain unchanged. The fund’s strategy includes opportunistically purchasing Ethereum futures, reflecting the growing interest in this digital asset over the past year. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Hidden Threat?

The fate of the Ether futures applicants remains uncertain, as the SEC has requested that they update their filings with any additional information by Friday afternoon. Lastly, Steven McClurg, Chief Investment Officer at Valkyrie, expressed enthusiasm about being at the forefront of offering Ethereum futures to investors, recognizing the exponential growth in interest surrounding this asset class.

18155792,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553359,1695931236,Ripple CTO Addresses Bitcoin Adviser’s Claims That XRP Is Centralized,"Ripple CTO David Schwartz has addressed claims made by El Salvador Advisor Max Keiser that the XRP token is a “centralized” cryptocurrency. Schwartz took to X (formerly Twitter) to clear the air, stating that the Bitcoin Adviser’s opinion of XRP was too ignorant to warrant a proper reciprocation. Ripple CTO Criticizes Centralization Claims On September 24, Co-founder of Volcano Energy and Bitcoin Advisor to El Salvador’s President, Max Keiser made a controversial statement about the XRP token. In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Keiser stated that Ripple’s native token, XRP was “centralized”, which was negatively received by the community and triggered a response from the Ripple CTO. Related Reading: Major Milestones Shows XRP Ledger Is Becoming A DeFi Force To Be Reckoned With Responding to Keiser’s controversial claim about the XRP, Schwartz expressed his indignation and stated that he found the statement laughable. “This is such an incredibly stupid argument I have no idea how I could possibly respond to it other than to laugh,” Schwartz said. In addition to Schwartz, the Product Head of Visa Installment and former employee of Ripple, Josh Gierscha, also jumped on the bandwagon to debunk Keiser’s claims. Initially, Giersch had believed that Keiser’s centralization claims were made from an X account impersonating the Bitcoin Advisor or from a fan account. However, Schwartz revealed that the comment was made by the real Max Keiser. He responded by quoting the original post from Keiser’s real account. Of course the real Max Keiser would never say anything this dumb.https://t.co/dd9JQUPvIYhttps://t.co/mOkN3v0vFU — David “JoelKatz” Schwartz (@JoelKatz) September 27, 2023 Giersch then topped off the conversation, saying, “Keiser’s an industrial-grade crank, I shouldn’t have expected any better from him” Keiser’s view on the XRP token was based on the cryptocurrency’s US patent created by Schwartz in 1992 which illustrated a cooperative system involving several interconnected computers. This is not the first time that Keiser has said something to draw the ire of the XRP community. The Bitcoin advisor has had a poor view of the token for some time now and occasionally criticizes XRP while idolizing Bitcoin. Back in May, the Bitcoin advisor had come under fire following a statement labeling the XRP token a “shitcoin.” XRP Twitter Community Reacts To Centralization Argument The XRP community also poured out to criticize Keiser’s claims about the token. One community member attributed the statements to Bitcoin maxis being scared of the token’s abilities, saying; “Bitcoin maxis are terrified of XRP.” Related Reading: Is $10,000 Possible For XRP Price? Crypto Analysts Weigh In Another X user jumped in to add their own two cents saying that Keiser was being intentionally misleading to his over 500,000 followers. Pointing to the patent which Keiser used as the basis for his statement, the user said “There’s no way he believes you filed a patent for the XRPL in 1988. Not a chance. Yet this is what he asserts. Seems he’s just an “ends justify the means” type of guy.” Keiser’s remark on XRP’s decentralization contradicts the inherent nature of the token which is seen in its value as a digital payment currency and an open-source ledger blockchain.

18154848,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553162,1695929259,Back To BlockShine ☀️,"As I kid I remember reading a Donald Duck story about him being frustrated that people were different to him. In the story, he then all of a sudden multiplied to be in the city with just various versions of himself, leading everything to be a total mess. Turns out, we need different views, temperaments, skills, and cultural standpoints to make this whole planet thing work. These days, when ever you have something real to say, you are a threat to someone. We’ve lost the idea that some of our bad ideas should die facing better ones in public conversations, so we don’t all have to die by the bad ideas. As it is perceived by many that there is no transcendent realm in the west, many feel like their ideas is who they are. So challenging ideas, even the awful ones, feels like dying to them. We are each others checks and balances, if this democracy thing is done right, but it goes beyond it. We are born with different temperaments to maintain the balance of the cosmos, even if the planets collide into one another on occasion. A simpler way is trying a make a NY socialite do your farm growing. As hinted towards in the previous article, the art world is by en large, is still totally clueless about the value of digital decentralised certificates. The human desire to erase the parts we don’t like, multiply ourselves in an attempt to reach utopia, and play power games – without accountability – led to this multiplied Donald Duck nightmare. Real inclusivity means inclusivity of temperaments and ideas foreign to us, and that is HARD work to live with. The law of entropy means something Ayn Rand once said: You Can Avoid Reality, But You Cannot Avoid the Consequences of Avoiding Reality The Fork and Flip piece now works in AR via the Artivive app From Vantaa to Dubai When I was a kid, a couple kids used to call me “big head” as my head was disproportionately bigger than the rest of my body. It was true at that point, but I figure it had also something to do with those big ideas I had, that didn’t really fit into the sub-urban grey Vantaa school setting. I’m sure you’ve never heard of Vantaa, but that has something to do with big ideas not being so common there, even if some individuals reach escape velocity. Not saying it was Bronx in the 70’s, but as tough environments damage us, but they also breed sisu. This is a Finnish term equivalent to something like grit, but it doesn’t quite cover it. It has been a very useful thing throughout my life, as I keep being animated and inspired by big ideas. This bubble head figure is being turned into a 50cm 3D statue by the talented and idea filled Hadrien from Arteier3D. We met through Hamad Al Ali from Yalla Group earlier in Dubai, and kept in touch figuring out ways to work together. Getting this statue done is a great honor for me with a sentiment reaching all the way to some lemons being made into lemonade since a kid. It comes to show that through working hard enough and pushing for a vision, things become possible. Very grateful for this whole process now, even if part of the pain remains as the rocket fuel to elevate further still. More on this collab later, as we are onto even bigger ideas. Renaissance 360 continued The Desert Rose piece from the MIrrors series. Blow up at the Theatre of Digital Art in Dubai Would you live here? Would you fly in this? Thanks to Mic Kuisma, that I finally met in person at the Tmrw Conf in Serbia, I was introduced to Martin from White Mammoth studios. He is now responsible for the implementation of “Desert Rose” into a fantastic render of a villa as well as a jet, giving a vision on where we are headed. We will be working together on many things, to which this is a great start. What does it look like, when liabilities get turned into assets via a creative art & licence process utilising digital certificates? Can assets be turned into further value through the same process? Before heading to Finland this summer, due to the kind introduction of H.E Amna Fikri, we had a meeting with the eloquent H.E Fahad Al Gergawi, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Dubai Investment Development Agency (Dubai FDI). We keep being inspired by the vision of Dubai and UAE, as well as feel there is a significant contribution we can add to the region via our Renaissance 360 concept. fT NFT at Dubai Mall Pioneering physical and digital integration, the ftNFT Art Gallery located at the Dubai Mall is one of its kind.

BTC earlier rose to just shy of $27,300 and was trading at $27,010 at press time, up 3.2% over the past 24 hours.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the performance of a broad basket of crypto assets, was up 3.8%, led by a 5.5% gain for the CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF).  COMP, AAVE and MKR, governance tokens of top DeFi lending platforms Compound, Aave, and Maker, enjoyed 21%, 10% and 5% gains, respectively. LDO, the token of the leading liquid staking platform Lido Finance, jumped nearly 9%.  Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum’s ARB posted a 9.6% rally, recovering losses from earlier this month.  The crypto advance happened alongside a modest rebound in U.S. stocks as the 10-year Treasury yield pulled back from a 16-year high, oil retreated from a 2023 high and the greenback slipped as well.

BTC is still ranging between $25,000 and $31,000, and it might be headed to the upper bound after testing the lower threshold earlier this month, Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at Stockcharts.com, said in an interview on CoinDesk TV’s First Mover show.  “My baseline scenario is bitcoin to move higher and eventually move past that $31,000-$32,000 barrier,” Kampenaer said. But it has to happen in the next 6-8 weeks, he added, otherwise the level could put a lid on BTC’s price for a longer time. “If it remains suppressed and under that barrier, it becomes stronger and more difficult to break.”  In case BTC breaks decisively below the $25,000, it could fall to the next support level at $17,000-$18,000, he added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/28/bitcoin-tops-27k-as-rates-and-oil-retreat-ether-outperforms-on-etf-hopes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62d69bd5a3eecdca49161611ef6721addd5871bb-1834x1042.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392462,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6zyL,1695928245,Ripple Cancels Plan to Buy Fortress Trust,"Ripple said it won't go forward with its outright acquisition of Nevada-based chartered trust company Fortress Trust.  ""A few weeks ago, we signed a letter of intent to acquire Fortress Trust – we’ve since made the decision not to move forward with an outright acquisition, though Ripple will remain an investor,"" Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).  Ripple said on Sept. 8 that it intended to buy Fortress for an undisclosed amount. At the time, a person with knowledge of the matter said the price tag was less than the $250 million Ripple paid for custody firm Metaco in May.  The day before, Fortress Trust disclosed a theft of customers’ cryptocurrency, later revealed to total close to $15 million. It pinned the blame on an unnamed third-party vendor that had fallen victim a phishing attack. CoinDesk later identified the vendor as Retool, a San Francisco-based company with Fortune 500 customers, which had built a portal for a handful of Fortress clients to access their funds. Ripple said the acquisition talks predated the theft, but it accelerated them.  Fortress Trust, which provides financial and regulatory infrastructure for blockchain companies, was formed by Scott Purcell, who has a long history in the industry. He was CEO of crypto custodian Prime Trust until 2020. Years after he left Prime Trust, the company was ordered into receivership after fellow custodian BitGo terminated its proposed acquisition of the firm.  ""The Fortress team is incredibly talented, and has built products solving real customer problems. While this outcome is different from what was originally planned, we’ll continue to support them and hope to work together in the future,"" Garlinghouse added.

18154093,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553387,1695927643,Bitcoin’s Hidden Threat? Miner Revenue Sent To Exchanges Surges Over 300%,"The world’s flagship crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), is showing some signs of tension. While external events frequently steer its course, the latest headwinds arise from within its mining community, as recent data suggests mounting selling pressure from Bitcoin miners. Miles Deutscher, a seasoned crypto analyst, has been vocal about this emerging trend, casting light on what might be a significant underlying issue in the Bitcoin realm. Given the innate mechanics of Bitcoin, miners play a pivotal role not just in transaction verification but also in the coin’s overall market dynamics. Related Reading: Bitcoin In Spotlight: Robert Kiyosaki Questions BTC’s Future Amid Citibank’s Blockchain Play Selling Pressure Amplified By Miners There’s currently an escalating concern in the Bitcoin community. Miners, the entities ensuring Bitcoin’s transactional integrity and security, appear to be offloading their holdings at an unprecedented rate. Glassnode, renowned for its report on blockchain data analytics, has revealed that miner revenue sent to exchanges has skyrocketed, marking a new all-time high of 315%. Such statistics beckon inquiries. Deutscher’s analysis points toward several factors that could be prompting this sell-off converging to produce this scenario. According to Deutscher, Bitcoin’s all-time high hash rates, peak mining difficulty levels, and escalating operational costs have squeezed miners. One of #Bitcoin‘s biggest supply headwinds right now (that no one is taking about) is the increasing miner sell pressure. ATH hash rates, peak difficulty + rapidly rising energy prices have combined to heavily affect mining profitability. With rewards set to be cut in half via… pic.twitter.com/HlL2nuendj — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) September 28, 2023 With the profitability of mining endeavors getting pinched and the next halving event looming on the horizon, it’s plausible that miners seek to liquidate their BTC holdings. Deutscher explained such sales are essential for these miners to maintain operational fluidity and ensure their ventures remain viable. Implications For The Broader Bitcoin Market With Bitcoin being decentralized, every actor, from individual hodlers to large-scale miners, plays a part in its market dynamics. As miners dispatch more BTC holdings to exchanges, they inadvertently ramp the selling pressure. If it persists, such a trend can exert a downward force on Bitcoin’s price. However, it’s worth noting that this is just one piece of a vast jigsaw. While miners’ selling pressures are influential, other macro factors, such as approving a spot BTC Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), regulatory landscape, and market sentiment, will influence Bitcoin’s journey ahead.

K33 Research Shares Its Altcoin Trading Playbook In a new post on X, K33 Research (formerly Arcane Research) explained that new altcoins make better trades than old ones. The firm has given a few reasons for why this is so. “In lack of price-driving fundamentals, the narratives and liquidity matter,” explains the research organization. “And new coins generally outperform old coins.” Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Rockets To $1,500 With 15% Surge, Will This Run Continue? K33 Research has used the example of some “Ethereum killers” during the last bull market to show how the newer coins outperform the older ones. The below chart shows how the performance of these coins has been compared (note that the Y-axis, the price, is normalized concerning September 22, 2020, here). How the new vs old Ethereum killers performed during the 2021 bull mark | Source: K33 Research on X From the chart, it’s apparent that Tron (TRX) and EOS (EOS), which were vouched as the Ethereum killers during the 2017/18 bull market, failed to set new all-time highs (ATHs) during the 2021 bull run. However, the new kids on the block, like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), observed much better returns than the old, established altcoins during the latest bull market. Why do old altcoins have difficulty returning to their former glory? According to K33 Research, there are a few factors behind this. First, the coins that have gone through a cycle have many holders at a loss, waiting to come into the green to exit. These underwater investors provide additional selling pressure during rallies that new coins, where everyone is in the green during the initial rally, don’t have to face. The old coins also have to deal with the rising circulating supply because of the token unlocks, which, due to supply-demand dynamics, can hurt the price if the demand side doesn’t catch up. How QTUM's returns waned over time | Source: K33 Research on X Finally, the research firm notes that old coins are also tied to narratives that have gone out of fashion. On the other hand, new coins are the narratives when they launch and, thus, appear interesting to investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Long-Term Holders Deposit To Exchanges While new altcoins certainly have a leg up to old coins regarding these factors, K33 Research notes that not all such coins make for a good investment. The firm advises investors to look for a few things to know whether a project may be worth investing in. The first thing could be whether or not the total number of holders is rising rapidly for the altcoin. A high amount of adoption means the asset has more steam behind it for building sustainable moves. The firm also says that a low float and high fully dilated value (FDV) should be avoided.

42392460,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg6zo5,1695921526,Banking Giants Abuzz About Tokenization of Real-World Assets as DeFi Craves Collateral,"Rather than an open network like Ethereum, Citi and JPMorgan use a private version of the blockchain.  Franklin Templeton says private blockchains will fade next to fast-innovating public utility chains.  Eventually, the biggest market for banks’ tokenized real world assets will be public blockchain protocols, predicts co-founder of decentralized oracle network Chainlink.  Banks and blockchains: Together at last?  Tokenization, the blockchain-based ownership and exchange of real-world assets (RWA), was one of the buzzwords at last week’s Sibos conference in Toronto, the global banking industry’s annual technology convention.  Old hands in the cryptocurrency field are probably rolling their eyes, remembering the “blockchain, not bitcoin” narrative that was popular circa 2016. During that crypto bear market, vendors breathlessly pitched sanitized versions of blockchain networks (referred to as the somniferous mouthful “distributed ledger technology”) to financial institutions and other corporations. Little came of these pilot tests and proofs of concept.  But while it’s easy to feel déjà vu, blockchains, both public and private, are evolving and, some say, on a path to converging.  At one end of the spectrum are banks and financial institutions, whose blockchain activities have largely been confined to using permissioned networks, and are attracted by purported cost-saving efficiencies. These firms are now eyeing tokenization roadmaps that would digitize everything from money market funds to large but illiquid private markets and areas like real estate. Public blockchain ecosystems are at the other end of the spectrum, looking for asset diversification to fuel areas like decentralized finance (DeFi).  “Eventually the biggest market for real world assets from banks will be public blockchain protocols that need diversified collateral,” said Sergey Nazarov, the co-founder of decentralized oracle network Chainlink. “I think the public blockchain protocols are the ones that will be willing to pay the biggest premium for this diversified collateral. The yield from the public blockchain world will be very attractive to banks and public chains will greatly benefit from the assets that the banks tokenize and put into their protocols, making those protocols more resilient and reliable.”  To be sure, financial institutions will likely proceed cautiously in the U.S., where regulators are discouraging them from touching anything related to crypto in the wake of last year’s price crash and the FTX exchange’s collapse. Europe and Asia, by contrast, could steal a march on the U.S., given the relative clarity in these jurisdictions.  Even so, there also seems to be some convergence among enterprises on Ethereum-compatible products and services: Last week saw announcements from Citi, which is piloting tokenized deposits and a trade finance application, and details of a tokenization engine from institutional custody firm Taurus, which has begun working with Deutsche Bank among others.  JPMorgan and Ethereum  Tokenization isn’t new. It’s been the mission for mega-bank JPMorgan since beginning its blockchain program back in 2015 and releasing Quorum, its permissioned fork of the Ethereum code. The bank’s Onyx Digital Assets platform, settling with tokenized fiat JPM Coin, has handled over $900 billion of transactions since going live a few years ago (admittedly, a drop in the bucket for a bank that does over $8 trillion of payments a day.)  Edging towards the public Ethereum mainnet has always been a delicate business, given that banks have traditionally viewed public blockchains as more or less radioactive, both a reputational and compliance risk. JPMorgan’s head of Onyx Digital Assets, Tyrone Lobban, noted that the public Ethereum chain has evolved significantly over time, from the proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. (The former is more energy-intensive and has made Bitcoin a bete noire of environmentalists, giving ESG-conscious banks reason to prefer the latter.) Plans to add better scaling technology and multiple data layers on Ethereum could also cater to the needs of enterprises over time, he said.  “You hear terms like ‘subnets’ or ‘supernets’ or ‘hyperchains.’ Basically, these things are a more controlled space on a public blockchain,” Lobban said. “You still get the benefits of having a highly redundant, ever-persistent settlement rail in the public blockchain, but you have the ability to operate in a more controlled environment with AML KYC [anti-money laundering, know-your-customer] requirements, for instance. So a smaller set of participants are validating transactions or are privy to those transactions, without necessarily exposing all of that to the full public ecosystem,” he added.  The Franklin Templeton Effect  Despite an uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S., $1.4 trillion investment giant Franklin Templeton, has gone straight to public blockchains.  Franklin Templeton started exploring the tech back in 2019 because the firm was doing its own transfer agency work, recording the ownership and buying of shares in a mutual fund, and understood how much cost was buried in that task, explained Sandy Kaul, SVP, Head of Digital Asset and Industry Advisory Services.  “We ran a side-by-side pilot, demonstrating to the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] that the books and records that we're keeping on the public blockchain are correct and equal to the traditional transfer agency book of records,” Kaul said. “We got them comfortable, and we have been running that fund for a year and half now as a token on public blockchain.”  Kaul also referred to the evolution of the public Ethereum chain and its shift to proof-of-stake, which, she said, provided free benefits to anyone running a node on the network.  “It’s going to be very difficult for these private blockchains to keep pace with that rate of innovation and with the cost efficiency of having the big public blockchains operating almost like the utilities of the future,” she said.  Citi’s Token Services  Like JPMorgan, Citi is not a newcomer to digital assets, beginning blockchain-related work back in 2015 at its Innovation Lab. Earlier this year, Citi hired enterprise blockchain veteran Ryan Rugg, a former executive at IBM and banking blockchain specialist R3, to head up the bank’s new token services unit. The bank’s tokenization pilot operates on a permissioned basis and is only running in the U.S. and Singapore for now.  “I sometimes joke that I probably know more about what not to do, than what to do – because of my experience at tech companies big and small, and building consortia and watching applications evolve. One of the big lessons I learned is you can’t have a large entity owning the network,” Rugg said.  An example of Citi working on a shared market utility using digital assets is the Regulated Liability Network proof of concept with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Innovation Center and several banks and industry participants, Rugg pointed out. She said interoperability between banks’ tokenized fiat offerings is the way forward.  “We recognize that clients want multi-bank, multi-jurisdiction, cross-border liquidity,” Rugg said. “They don’t want a siloed system; they want to be able to move liquidity freely across a multitude of banks and to streamline that operational process and optimize their liquidity across their markets.”  Lobban of JPMorgan said discussions about moving assets across chains come up, particularly as other banks’ platforms begin to emerge, and that the largest bank in the U.S. is exploring various interoperability solutions. But he added that it’s a complex problem with non-technical challenges that need to be addressed to become a reality.  “Deposit tokens are representations of commercial bank money, so you’re dealing with different credit ratings and credit risk associated with these commercial bank issuances, as well as important regulatory guidelines,” Lobban said. “There are also legal considerations when moving assets out of your official books and records to someone else’s official books and records.”  Aoyon Ashraf contributed reporting.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/28/banking-giants-abuzz-about-tokenization-of-real-world-assets-as-defi-craves-collateral,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aed1bd54e772c3020f8ede07ebcc899f8be990a0-1980x1320.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Majority Of UAE Crypto Transactions Exceeds $1 million The report from Chainalysis reveals that institutional investments accounted for the majority of cryptocurrency transactions in the UAE with over 67% from July 2022 to June 2023. The Institutional investments in the country range from $1 million, followed by professional investments ranging from $10,000 to $1 million, and retail investments which accounted for just 4.63% of cryptocurrency transactions in the country up to $10,000. Related Reading: Analyst Presents 4 Charts That Prove Crypto Is Not Dead Kim Grauer, the Director of Research at Chainalysis shed more light on this significant trend noting that the report marks a significant interest among organizations and high-net-worth individuals in the UAE to add cryptocurrency to their investment portfolios. “The fact that by far the larger portion of crypto investments in the UAE is for institutional and professional-sized transactions, indicates an eagerness from organizations and high-net-worth individuals to add cryptocurrency to their investment portfolios. This market confidence is validation of the efforts being made by the country’s leadership to offer commendable regulatory clarity, and establish the nation as a global crypto hub,” the director said. The report shows that UAE was one of the only countries in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region to spot a higher share of crypto activity within the decentralized exchanges than centralized exchanges. The country’s decentralized exchanges activity was over 48% with centralized exchanges accounting for 46%. So far, the country’s crypto market value dropped by 17% over the past year accounting for over $34 billion in crypto market value this year. However, the country still managed to outperform other countries in the MENA region. The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector has also seen tremendous popularity in the country since 2022. This further proves that the country has been successful in passing innovation-friendly regulatory frameworks that allow the development of innovative cryptocurrency platforms in the country, with a direction that keeps consumers safe. The country also displayed its interest in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) over time.

Maker Has Outperformed Top Coins With 15% Rally In Past Week While giants like Bitcoin have struggled recently, MKR has proven to be different as the coin has observed an impressive run of bullish momentum. Following the latest leg up in the asset’s rally, it has surged past the $1,500 level, a feat it hasn’t replicated since May 2022, almost a year and a half ago now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Long-Term Holders Deposit To Exchanges The below chart shows what the asset’s recent rally has looked like: The value of the cryptocurrency has sharply gone up in recent days | Source: MKRUSD on TradingView Out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, only Chainlink (LINK) and Curve (CRV) have seen better returns than Maker’s 15% gains during the past week. Even these two assets haven’t seen bullish momentum as consistent as MKR in the past month, though, as MKR’s superb 42% profits in the period notably outshine theirs. Maker Active Addresses Have Hit A 10-Week High According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this sharp run in MKR has come alongside a surge in the cryptocurrency’s “active addresses” metric. This indicator keeps track of the daily total number of unique Maker addresses that are taking part in some kind of transaction activity on the blockchain. This metric’s value can simply be looked at as the amount of traffic that the network is receiving every day. When the indicator has high values, it means that a large number of users are participating in the trading activity of the asset. Such a trend implies that interest in the coin is high currently. Now, here is a chart that shows how the active addresses metric has changed for MKR during the past month: Looks like the value of the indicator has shot up over the last few days | Source: Santiment no X From the graph, it’s visible that the Maker active addresses have climbed up alongside the rally in the asset’s price. After the latest increase in the indicator, its value has hit 651, which is the highest observed in around 10 weeks. Generally, for any surge to be sustainable, it requires continued participation from a large amount of traders. Rallies that aren’t accompanied by a sufficient rise in user activity usually run out of steam before long. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Now Most Sustainably-Powered Global Industry: Data Since the latest Maker surge has seen an increasing number of addresses becoming active, signs could be looking good for its sustainability. As the price continues its run, though, some investors might be tempted to harvest the high profits that they have amassed. In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the exchange netflow, which shows that some inflows of $7.6 million just have occurred towards centralized exchange platforms, implying that profit-taking may already be beginning. This is a relatively modest amount, but the analytics firm warns that inflows can be something to be cautious about, as they could lead towards at least a temporary top in the price.

If the pattern is valid, the target is roughly $4,000 per ETH and a revisit to former all-time highs from the last bull market. VanEck Announces ETH Futures ETF Global asset manager VanEck, known best for its ETFs and Mutual Funds, today revealed the upcoming launch of the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETUF). ETUF will be “an actively managed ETF designed to seek capital appreciation by investing in Ether (ETH) futures contracts.” Related Reading: Bloomberg Analysts Say Ethereum Futures ETFs Could Start Trading Soon – Here’s When Rather than investing in spot ETH, the Fund will trade Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) ETH futures, and will be managed by the firm’s Head of Active Trading, Greg Krenzer.

And although its inception of November 15, 2021 marked the end of the bull market in crypto, the introduction of Ethereum futures has the potential to kickstart the next bull run. Ether's target is $4,000 based on the measure rule | ETHUSD on TradingView.com Ethereum News Catalyst Could Trigger Ascending Triangle Breakout Show me the chart and I’ll tell you the news, is a famous quote from the late Bernard Baruch. The message reflects the fact that the largest technical moves tend to coincide with a news catalyst and vice-versa.

Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond This is precisely what appears to be brewing in ETHUSD charts since June of 2022. Unlike Bitcoin which put in a bottom late in 2022, Ethereum found support about halfway through the year. Since then, Ether has consistently made higher lows, forming a potential ascending triangle chart pattern. Now, the ascending triangle pattern is nearing the two-thirds point from its apex. This increases the chances of a breakout occurring as an Ethereum futures ETF gets launched have increased significantly. All that’s required is a breakout above $2,000 per ETH on higher than normal volume. Based on the measure rules, reaching the target objective could push prices to over $4,000.

Coinbase To Launch Crypto Futures Trading Worldwide Crypto exchange Coinbase recently announced the launch of a derivatives platform for its international clients. The US company has been trying to increase its presence overseas as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tightens regulatory conditions in the country. In that sense, the crypto trading venue launched an international arm to grow revenue as spot trading volumes decline with the crypto market. Today, the exchange is confirmed to have secured a license with the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) to allow institutions to trade perpetual futures outside the US. The company said in an official statement: Today, we are excited to announce that Coinbase International Exchange has received additional regulatory approval from the BMA to extend perpetual futures trading to non-US retail customers. In the coming weeks, we will begin to offer eligible customers access to regulated perpetual futures contracts on Coinbase Advanced. This announcement could onboard more traders to the crypto ecosystem to benefit Bitcoin, the XRP price, and the entire market. XRP has been among the most popular coins in the past few months following a critical legal victory in the US. XRP Price Ready For A Surprise Soon? While the legal scenario in the US is still uncertain for the nascent sector, analyst Brett Hill believes that XRP is one of the coins that will benefit due to its victory against the SEC. The analyst claims that the “Far West,” the era where everything was allowed, is “virtually over” for the nascent industry. If this scenario plays out, tokens with legal support will thrive, and XRP and Bitcoin seem the two likely winners in this new era. Just yesterday, SEC Chair Gensler reiterated that Bitcoin is not a security, according to US law, and a court did the same for XRP.

The company has one of the lower breakeven costs by my calculations but is running low on cash and has a $250 million shelf that is largely untouched. With 7 months until the halving, I think other miners will benefit more from a rise in BTC's price between now and the end of 2024. When I last covered Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) in March, it was the fastest growing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining operation in the public markets. At $2.33 per share, I initiated coverage with a hold and noted that I wanted to see some additional quarters of performance before considering a share purchase. Like most of the public mining equities, CIFR roughly doubled between early-June and mid-July 2023. Data by YCharts Since the summer-spike in the public miners, CIFR has retraced the entire run and is right back where it was when I last covered it. With two quarters in the books since that article, I think it's worth looking at Cipher once again to see how the company's business has developed. Q2 Earnings In the last quarter, Cipher Mining reported $31.2 million in revenue against $15.9 million in cost of revenue for a gross profit of $15.4 million. Data by YCharts Operating expenses came in at $34.4 million and the company's operating income was ($19.0) million for the quarter. This was by no means the worst quarter for the company from a negative net income standpoint but it was a sequential decline in operating income versus Q1. In the quarter, Cipher mined 1,259 BTC and had a modest stack of 417 BTC at the end of June. Q1-23 Q2-23 Cost of Revenues $8,100,000 $15,900,000 Total Opex $26,900,000 $34,400,000 BTC Mined 1,154 1,259 Breakeven Price $30,329 $39,952 Source: Cipher Mining, author's calculations Adding costs of revenue and total opex vs the quarterly mining production can help give a reasonable estimate for what the company's breakeven bitcoin price might be. Rounding up, we get a $40k breakeven BTC price for Cipher Mining. Based on my estimates, this would put Cipher in the same ballpark as companies like CleanSpark ( CLSK ), Bitfarms ( BITF ), and HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE ). However, Cipher had very little cash left on the balance sheet at the end of June: Data by YCharts Compared to the companies mentioned above, Cipher has the lowest cash position of the group and also appears to have the smallest BTC stack of the bunch as well at the end of August. August Production At the end of August, Cipher disclosed 6.8 EH/s but guided for 7.2 EH/s in September as the company completes its buildout at its Odessa facility. With global hash rate still grinding higher even as the price of BTC remains pinned to $26,000, the economics of mining continues to be under quite a bit of pressure. IntoTheBlock In July and August, Cipher was able to mine just 775 BTC combined. That represents a 14% drop versus the first two months of Q2. To be fair, keeping up with global hash rate is a challenge that is felt industry-wide. Furthermore, Cipher did benefit from 28 BTC equivalent and 45 BTC equivalent in power sales in July and August. June 2023 August 2023 BTC Change % Change Bitfarms 549 654 105 19.1% CleanSpark 529 1,677 1,148 217.0% Bit Digital ( BTBT ) 485 758 273 56.3% Cipher Mining 417 519 102 24.5% Source: Company filings, analyst's calculations At the end of the month, Cipher held 519 bitcoin but has generally lagged similarly sized peers in aggregate BTC stack growth and by percentage since the end of the second quarter. The ATM All of this is getting to the elephant in the room which is the company's $250 million shelf that has only just started being tapped. On the Q2 call, management noted just $2.7 million of that shelf has been drawn from: We utilized the ATM for the first time this quarter and issued approximately 978,000 shares at an average fair market value of $2.78 was $2.7 million net of issuance fees. We believe the ATM is a useful tool which we can access in the right market conditions and for the right growth opportunities On one hand, it's unfortunate that Cipher wasn't able to hit that ATM in July when the share price was over $5. But it is at least worth mentioning that they were able to sell shares at a 20% premium to where the stock is currently valued. The Clock Is Ticking We are now a little under 7 months away from the bitcoin halving event as of article submission. At that time, the reward from mining will drop from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block. If hash rate and the price of BTC remain constant, it will effectively equate to a 50% reduction in revenue for all miners overnight. LookIntoBitcoin It should go without saying, but past performance is not indicative of future returns. However, the price of BTC has historically ripped to a new all-time high within 6 to 10 months following a halving. But this mechanism continuing again following the next halving in April is likely dependent on demand for BTC remaining constant. That is far from a certainty in the current interest rate environment. Federal Reserve One of the variables that is completely different this time around is the current cost of capital. While it is absolutely fair to point out that bitcoin's price rallied during 2017 when Jerome Powell's Fed was last raising interest rates, a 5% Fed funds rate is probably a different animal. Also, Bitcoin was still largely viewed as a joke by most of the mainstream financial pundits back in 2017. While there are certainly those who still believe Bitcoin is a joke, the market has matured significantly since the 2017 cycle top and TradFi entities like BlackRock ( BLK ) are now trying to enter the space with a spot ETF. Summary If you believe Bitcoin is finding a floor through what has been a months-long consolidation between $25,000 to $30,000, CIFR may be a somewhat safe bet after getting cut in half since July. I take that view because the miner equities generally move higher when BTC moves higher and they historically rally to a larger degree than the underlying. However, even in that environment, I think there are other mining equities that will outperform CIFR if BTC does indeed make a sustained move higher into the $30k area. I don't personally hold CIFR, but I wouldn't rule it out entirely if management can efficiently raise capital through the shelf offering without diluting shareholders to the degree that we've seen some of the other miner equities dilute. But in my view, Cipher is running low on both cash and time. So for now, I'm maintaining my ""hold"" call even though other analysts may skew more bullish.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4637926-cipher-mining-low-on-cash-and-time?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18149083.jpeg

42392476,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg70sl,1695915900,Crypto for Advisors: AI - Friend or Foe to the Advisor?,"New technology often scares people. It can change the status quo and disrupt people's comfort zones, and history has shown that untested technology can have unintended consequences. As Artificial Intelligence has arrived on the scene, we've seen an influx of capital into AI startups and new applications. In my circles, our friends and family are playing with tools like ChatGPT to get a sense of the opportunity and possibilities ahead. Already, we are seeing legal issues and concerns over the application of this new technology.  As with anything new, AI can improve parts of your business or disrupt workflow, making client interactions more challenging. Today, Jordi Visser from Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers discusses where and how your clients will first encounter AI technology. Studies estimate that more than 300 million jobs worldwide will be affected by AI technology, and the most at-risk are white-collar workers. Interestingly, repeated Internet searches list roles that AI will automate and could impact, yet the role of 'advisor' or 'financial planner' is not targeted to be obsoleted by emerging technology.  While investor demographics will change and investors will gain access to more technology tools like robo-advisors and AI-traded portfolios, the trusted relationship between advisors, their networks and clients is forecasted to remain intact. Are you ready for this disruption? Will AI be your friend or your foe?  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  The Importance of Authenticity for Trust in an AI-Driven World  Trust is the bedrock of all relationships, as financial advisors know all too well. It is said that trust takes years to build, seconds to destroy and forever to repair. When trust breaks down, it wreaks havoc on how we interact and function, a troubling thought for investors facing no shortage of headwinds. A key ingredient for building trust is authenticity – the ability to be genuine, transparent and act with integrity, which is critical for advisors as they work to strengthen relationships with clients, build new ones and grow practices.  However, the rise of advanced AI threatens to undermine advisors’ authenticity in alarming ways. As machine learning algorithms become better at emulating human conversation, creativity and emotions, the line between real and artificial personas blurs and the end-client experience is suddenly called into question. AI chatbots, virtual influencers and deepfake videos make it hard to discern what is human-generated from machine-fabricated.  When interacting online, we rely on signals like profile photos, voices, brand familiarity and language to judge if someone is a real person and acting in good faith. But AI can skillfully imitate these, causing all sorts of risks for clients. The result is anxiety about living in a post-truth world inhabited by AI imposters.  With the launch of ChatGPT and the rise of generative AI, trust and authenticity are breaking down and this has been a wakeup call for the wealth management industry. It will drive advisors and investors alike to look to new innovations to not only protect, rebuild and repair trust, but to find out the right ways to harness AI’s remarkable capabilities in a positive manner.  Consider this: Nearly one in three investors would use artificial intelligence as their financial advisor, according to a recent survey by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, the body that governs the CFP designation for financial advisors. This poses an obvious threat to wealth managers, as well as raises significant concerns about the quality or appropriateness level of the financial advice that AI may recommend.  Not all hope is lost. The same survey shows that younger investors – a massive market for financial advisors – are more skeptical of using AI for financial advice than older ones. There’s no shortage of reports, including ones by Morningstar and Salesforce, showing how wealth advisors can use AI to grow their practices and become more efficient.  In 2008, while the world was no longer trusting the banking system just weeks after Lehman’s collapse, the Bitcoin white paper was released by Satoshi Nakamoto. The paper emphasized trust as the fundamental pillar on which the Bitcoin protocol is built and how trust is essential for any currency or financial system to function properly.  Restoring trust in the AI era will require turning to ideas put forth by Satoshi Nakamoto and blockchain technology. Blockchain provides decentralized, transparent records of data and transactions. Through blockchain verification, creators can prove authenticity and ownership of content, and investors can have faith that their financial portfolios are safe and secure.  Web3, dubbed the internet's next phase, emphasizes decentralized networks, establishing a direct, transparent connection between creators and consumers – a marked departure from prior battles against monopolistic forces. Though this new paradigm goes far beyond the financial advisor landscape (look no further than the Hollywood writers and actors strike, financial services will nonetheless need to adapt. Change is coming and advisors’ No. 1 weapon – the ability to earn and keep clients’ trust – will come under pressure.  As AI systems become more advanced at emulating human behaviors and media, they erode authenticity, a key pillar of trust and the bedrock of all successful financial advisor practices. When chatbots, deepfakes, and AI-written text seamlessly impersonate real people, it fosters an atmosphere of misinformation and deception, hardly a successful recipe for a happy client. Without transparency around AI, people lose faith in what is genuine versus artificially manufactured online; to maintain trust in an AI-driven world, advisors need new safeguards and a vigilant mindset to ensure that the authenticity and integrity that’s been so instrumental to their success stays safe.  – Jordi Visser, President and CIO, Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers  Ask an Advisor: How Blockchain is Transforming Traditional Finance  Do you see blockchain’s influence on TradFi right now?  While we think blockchain can transform traditional markets and finance, we don’t currently see any material impact. For now, the familiarity with traditional systems has kept the status quo in effect. There is a lot of room for increases in efficiency using blockchain but it will take time.  In what ways can blockchain increase efficiency for traditional finance?  We think that cost reduction is going to be one of the main advantages of blockchain. By disintermediating unnecessary steps and participants transacting with blockchain becomes more efficient and cheaper. For example, current Bitcoin transaction fees are around $1 per transaction. The cost to send a wire is generally around $25-$50; and while other forms of moving assets (like ACH) can be cheaper, the facilitator of those transactions still has the right to charge more. Not only are blockchain transaction fees more transparent and cheaper, they also allow for quicker movement of assets. The networks are up 24/7 and transactions are generally consummated in under 10 minutes. Moving small amounts of money might be easy with Venmo, CashApp, Paypal, and the like but it isn’t faster than utilizing a blockchain, and once you want to send even larger dollar amounts, the benefits of a 24/7 network become evident.  Is there a timeframe for blockchain to integrate itself into traditional finance?  It’ll take time obviously. We think that the interest in digital currencies will bring attention to the benefits of blockchain, even if it is through centralized platforms. But as interest increases people will see the benefit of blockchain and begin to apply it to other aspects of TradFi. We are just seeing the start through tokenized U.S. Treasuries. With over $1 billion in market cap it can be easy to swap into these yield products from conventional cryptocurrencies.  – Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM  Keep Reading  Voice of the Investor, by Morningstar covers “The Crypto Investor.” Some facts may be surprising to advisors.

42392479,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7131,1695914897,Examining dYdX’s Path to Profitable DeFi,"If you were in New York last week for the Mainnet conference and asked anyone you met to name the most admired companies in the cryptocurrency category, they’d likely mention an exchange. If you took a 10-minute cab ride to Wall Street and asked the same question about traditional finance, the answer would probably be a bank.  Galen Moore is the content lead at Axelar, which is providing technology for dYdX.  One of the curiosities of cryptocurrencies is that centralized exchanges are at the apex on almost any dimension: profits, use, stature and (yes) innovation (e.g., perpetual swaps, a type of derivative pioneered in crypto). DEXs, their decentralized counterparts, have contributed innovations like automated market makers (AMMs).  But so far DEX volume is a sliver of CEX volume — they are less-known, used by fewer and profits are nearly nonexistent: most protocols pay out in rewards more than they generate in fees.  The perpetual-swap exchange dYdX is an exception on that last point (profits). And yet, it hasn’t added a market pair since 2022 and its liquidity and listings are far behind the largest centralized derivatives exchanges. In the world of Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi), product-market fit is hard to find. How does dYdX do it?  Recently, dYdX announced a partnership with Axelar (where I have a role on the core team): it is rolling out version four (v4) of the exchange on a dedicated blockchain they are building with Cosmos SDK and Axelar is providing cross-chain infrastructure to onboard users and collateral deposits from other chains. That rollout is expected within the next month or two.  Learning more about dYdX gave me a fresh appreciation for what it’s delivered to users. I asked dYdX founder Antonio Juliano and spoke with multiple dYdX users to learn about the product decisions that have driven user adoption. Here’s what I found.  Background: Perp-swaps and dYdX v3  The perpetual swap (aka “perp-swap,” or just “perp”) is a derivative invented by the cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX. It’s like a futures contract, but instead of a maturity date it pays out funding rates periodically, usually every eight hours. Its popularity drove BitMEX’s rise starting in 2017 and ushered in a new class of professional cryptocurrency traders. (The rise of perps wasn’t all smooth: In 2019, I analyzed some of the systemic risks and flash crashes caused by early versions of the perp-swap product.)  Perp-swaps were also a key offering for now-bankrupt exchange FTX, which innovated by settling in dollars rather than bitcoin and listing pairs in a long tail of obscure altcoins. Of course, both FTX and BitMEX are centralized operations. As a DEX offering derivatives, dYdX was an early mover, rolling out its first perp-swap offering in 2020 using a centralized orderbook, matching engine and a noncustodial setup built with Ethereum smart contracts.  Three years later, the majority of DEX trading activity is still on spot-trading venues. The leading exception is dYdX.  The volume on dYdX today is largely thanks to two developments in 2021: 1) a shift off the Ethereum mainnet chain onto layer-2 rollups built by Starkware for faster and cheaper transactions; 2) the launch of the dYdX token, used for governance, security and, most critically, rewards. These changes became salient features of what is known as dYdX v3, enabling dYdX to increase trading volumes and quickly go from three listed pairs to more than 30.  Early-mover advantage has been a powerful factor: the last new listing dYdX announced was Tezos (XTZ-USD) in May 2022. Without adding market pairs or developing new features, dYdX retains a dominant position among derivatives DEXs.  Instead of adding listings or features, dYdX developers have focused on faithfully delivering the basic experience of trading on a centralized perp-swap exchange – especially for professional traders who trade via application programming interface (API). “For institutions, it’s important that it feel similar,” Juliano said. “We have made a lot of strides. Our current product that we built on top of Starkware was a huge step up.”  Why professional traders use dYdX v3  According to Juliano, about 80% of volume comes from these “institutions” interacting via API, while the remaining 20% comes from “prosumers” who trade via the exchange’s user interface.  I make a few assumptions about what Juliano means by “institutions.” It isn’t insurance and pension funds, or large asset managers. It’s small hedge funds and proprietary trading desks. They’re here for profit, not for learning or for innovation window-dressing. “Institutions” is a commonly used shorthand, but I prefer “professionals.”  The path to adoption in DeFi may turn out to be straightforward: market infrastructure that works as expected and maintains rules and transparency.  On any given day there are a half-dozen trusted centralized derivatives exchanges with multiples greater volume than dYdX. Why do these professionals choose a smaller, quasi-decentralized venue?  Reason #1: Transparency  Eric Qiu is a trader at CMS Holdings and is known as a dYdX bull, based on research he published earlier this year under a pen name, predicting DEX growth and continued dYdX dominance of the DEX derivatives category. CMS is a user of dYdX, a venture investor in the project, and a buyer and a trader of the dYdX token – holding equity, locked tokens and liquid tokens.  The firm’s use of dYdX starts with three letters: “FTX.” The transparency and security of the Ethereum blockchain provides assurances against misuse of funds, like the alleged pooling of exchange deposits with investment funds that brought FTX to bankruptcy.  “It’s preventing that black-swan event,” Qiu said. “In DeFi it's very simple to see. I deposited $100 million in this exchange and there's $100 million sitting in this wallet. On a centralized exchange you don't know where the liabilities stand.”  There’s some evidence beyond anecdote: monthly notional volume on dYdX got a bump in the first few months of 2023 – but it can easily be explained by a concurrent market rally after December lows.  Reason #2: Regulatory arbitrage  To one extent or another, the most liquid cryptocurrency derivatives markets have always been off-limits to users in the most regulated jurisdictions. That remains true today: neither dYdX nor Binance Futures offer products in Canada or the U.S.  It seems regulators across the world are friendlier to DeFi than those in the U.S.: dYdX specifically excludes just the U.S., Canada and a list of countries subject to U.S. sanctions. Binance, meanwhile, limits its service to about 100 countries, with notable exclusions on every continent.  There are many places in the world where dYdX is accessible, while Binance is not. And the penalties on Binance include loss of funds via the exchange’s stated right to “terminate, suspend, close, hold or restrict your access to any or all of your Binance Account(s)” – something that dYdX’s Ethereum smart contracts protect against.  For market makers, which likely make up a significant percentage of dYdX’s professional volume, that makes the exchange doubly attractive.  See also: Citi Says Decentralized Crypto Exchanges Are Gaining Market Share From Centralized Peers  “For a certain segment of traders, dYdX offers something that's hard to get elsewhere,” said Joshua Lim, former head of derivatives at Galaxy and Genesis Global Trading, now co-founder of Arbelos Markets, a principal trading business focused on crypto options. “If someone really wants levered exposure on ETH or BTC and can't get it on Binance, they will have to go somewhere else. Maybe that means they pay 25 or 50 basis points more, but there aren't many good alternatives. Customers are willing to pay a higher spread for access.”  Reason #3: Cheaper trades  Transparency and security might be enough for dYdX to charge a premium, but anecdotally, dYdX fees in some areas are lower than they would be on centralized derivatives exchanges.  Fees on dYdX compare favorably to centralized counterparts when depositing or withdrawing funds and when trading, ""99% of the time"" – especially if you count token rewards, Qiu said.  Of course, fees aren’t the only ways trade can cost money. In less-liquid markets, slippage costs traders money too, when the price moves temporarily on a trade that is larger than the market volume can absorb.  However, liquidity is a binary problem: either there is enough to execute a trade, or there isn’t. On dYdX, ETH and BTC markets handle hundreds of millions of dollars in daily notional volume, with a handful of altcoin markets in the 10s of millions. It’s enough for most traders, Qiu said. In thinner markets, limit orders can protect against excessive slippage.  Changes in dYdX v4  Earlier, I covered how dYdX v3 has been slow to add new features and market pairs. The core team of developers has been focused on building dYdX v4. The v4 release will move the exchange onto an appchain – an application-specific blockchain using Cosmos SDK. With this purpose-built blockchain for dYdX come three more salient developments: 1) decentralizing the dYdX orderbook and matching engine, 2) allowing permissionless addition of new market pairs and 3) distributing transaction-fee revenue to token holders.  “Liquidity is bifurcating in two directions: one points toward highly regulated venues like CME...At the opposite extreme is dYdX.”  Permissionless markets  In dYdX v3, a team of project developers has determined which market pairs to add to the exchange. The dYdX v4 update changes that, allowing the addition and removal of market pairs via on-chain governance.  Fast addition of new pairs has always been a differentiator for certain exchanges. Those more willing to take on regulatory risk have benefited from being first to provide access to new coins when they pop. Sometimes, these user-acquisition opportunities are ephemeral, as with memecoins that spike in volume before fading from relevance.  If permissionless market-pair additions work as intended, dYdX could go from being among the slowest exchanges to add new pairs to being among the fastest, providing opportunities to attract users from centralized competitors.  Fee distributions  Like many cryptocurrency exchanges, including both DEXs and centralized venues, dYdX uses both rewards and fees. Users pay fees per trade and receive rewards in the dYdX token, which in this function acts like a loyalty point.  See also: Centralized Exchanges Are Here to Stay | Opinion  Exchanges are some of the most profitable operations in crypto; over the long-term, no exchange should pay out more in rewards than its fee revenue. However, in DeFi, net payment for user acquisition is often the case. In 2022 Q4, it was so at dYdX. According to Messari: dYdX notched $128.1 million in revenue versus $197.3 million paid out in rewards, recording a yearly net loss of $69.3 million.  That’s changed recently, Juliano said, following a rewards cut that pushed dYdX on-chain exchange operations into the black. ""Our revenue started being higher than the dollar value of the token emissions,” he said. “Now people are paying on average to use the product versus just being incentivized to use it.”  In the future, it will be up to on-chain governance to determine that ratio – and holders of the dYdX token will be the ones receiving fee revenues. “No central party (including dYdX Trading Inc.) will have the ability to receive trading fees on dYdX v4,” the core team promised when v4 was announced in January 2022.  “I think people don't realize how lucrative dYdX is and how rare that is in crypto,” said Qiu. “You can go to the top 500 coins and you can look at the coins that actually generate revenue. There might be five. To be profitable while growing is super impressive and super rare.”  Conclusion: Decentralization required  The features of dYdX v4 may be more than additive. They may be existential. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Sept. 7 announced settlements with three derivatives exchanges charged with failing to register for appropriate licenses and illegally offering leveraged financial products.  The market is paying attention: the dYdX token was down about 9.5% since that news, as of Monday, more than three times ether’s drawdown over the same period.  Centralized exchanges are under a higher degree of regulatory pressure, and a hybrid, quasi-decentralized approach may be attractive to them, as Axelar co-founder Sergey Gorbunov wrote in a CoinDesk op-ed, earlier this year.  See also: Galen Moore – 'Super App' May Be Web3's Super Power | Opinion  Whatever they do, they’re likely to face increased competition from decentralized exchanges: as interoperability infrastructure matures, DEXs can onboard from any chain and offer pairs in any token.  Those that aren’t willing to take a step toward more complete decentralization may find themselves doubly squeezed in the middle.  “Liquidity is bifurcating in two directions: one points toward highly regulated venues like CME,” Lim said. ""At the opposite extreme is dYdX.”  “There's a ton of open regulatory questions around this type of permissionless protocol, but at least it's all on-chain,” Lim added. The trust factor there comes from knowing that the collateral is segregated and lives on-chain and that they're applying the same uniform rule set for margin management and liquidations for everyone. That's where many credit issues of the last cycle began: uneven and discretionary application of margining rules.”  The path to adoption in DeFi may turn out to be straightforward: market infrastructure that works as expected and maintains rules and transparency.

42392468,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg708b,1695914117,Using Proof-of-Stake for a Decentralized Credit Bureau,"At Spectral, we’re creating and incentivizing a network of modelers, creators, users and validators using proof-of-stake mechanics. The idea — similar to Chainlink (LINK) and The Graph’s (GRT) models — is to build a decentralized marketplace with a built-in feedback mechanism that ferrets out and discourages bad actors.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Staking Week."" James McGirk is a senior writer at Spectral Finance and the co-founder of Lonely ROCKS.  Our multi-asset credit risk oracle (MACRO) score is a machine learning model that weighs approximately 100 on-chain signals to produce a three-digit score predicting a wallet's likelihood of liquidation on an on-chain loan.The score is similar to the FICO score, and ranges from 300 (representing a very high risk of liquidation) to 850, representing a very low risk. It’s very similar to what you’d get from a traditional credit report, only instead of relying on Experian, Transunion and Equifax to keep tabs on your spending, you opt-in with your wallet.  The promise of an on-chain credit score is that it’s opt-in, completely transparent, and eventually, production of the algorithm generating the scores can be decentralized by incentivizing a competitive marketplace. Netflix pioneered the technique in the 2000s when they offered and eventually paid a million-dollar bounty to a team of data scientists who improved their recommendation algorithm by 10%.  See also: Staking Risks Are Vastly Misunderstood | Opinion  The traditional model of a validator network is to pay rewards to a validator node for producing blocks and validating rewards, and punishing nodes – which is called slashing – by taking away their stake when they misbehave, which entail failing to maintain the node, behaving maliciously or other blockchain malfeasance. You can also use validation to incentivize a contest. For example, you can divide a network into modelers (who are machine learning engineers earning bounties by creating accurate models) and creators, who create data science challenges for the modelers to tackle, in this case an accurate credit score generated from on-chain information.  We also have validators, who vet the models for quality, and, after the contest ends, we have users who pay to use scores (i.e. machine learning inferences) generated from the winning models. The idea is to use crypto to nourish a flourishing ecosystem that grows extremely accurate machine learning models as a byproduct.  Cryptoeconomics, when it works, creates a hothouse environment where ideas are iterated upon by people all over the world. Creditworthiness assessment is just one use case, by building on a blockchain, smart contracts can build off-chain processing (such as zero-knowledge machine learning) onto the system, so nearly any data set can be encrypted and worked on given enough processing power and time — whether it’s tumor hunting, medical records inferences, insurance payouts, bail calculations even training robotic operating systems to serve hamburgers.",POSITIVE,LINK | GRT,BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | GRT,James McGirk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/28/using-proof-of-stake-for-a-decentralized-credit-bureau,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f136a245ff446fc6c3f6c09e554a4bc77d704c2-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392469,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg70Ir,1695913755,Europe’s Crypto Industry Wants Staking Clarity as Regulations Loom,"Crypto staking has so far escaped specific regulation in Europe – but many in the industry wonder if it’s helpful to maintain a regulatory gray area.  There’s a dilemma for the sector here. Setting detailed rules for the still-developing staking sector could prove premature. But recent moves in Singapore and Switzerland show the risk of keeping a legal vacuum, into which regulators may rush to impose heavy-handed restrictions.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Staking Week.""  The European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets law (MiCA) makes the bloc the world’s first major jurisdiction with a more or less comprehensive crypto law, covering everything from stablecoin issuance to insider trading – but even MiCA leaves staking out.  That’s a gap that needs to be fixed, says the European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde, who’s called for the service – in which crypto holders can post their assets to earn passive income – to be addressed in a MiCA sequel. That would likely take years, if it happens at all – and some are worried about what will happen in the meantime.  Tom Duff Gordon, Vice President International Policy at Coinbase, sees staking as so fundamental to the crypto ecosystem that it needs to be nailed down – and says the lack of any attempt to do so is a major gap in MiCA.  “Just describing what that [staking] is, I think, would be helpful,” Gordon, the exchange’s Vice President for International Policy, told a Tuesday event hosted by the Blockchain for Europe lobby group.  The problems of a legal lacuna can be seen in Switzerland. In a Sept. 7 press release, the Swiss Blockchain Federation warned of a “change in practice” by financial regulators at Finma, under which only licensed banks can offer staking – something the lobby group said could limit the country’s innovation and competitiveness.  For its part, Finma has told CoinDesk that it continues to follow “clear and precise” blockchain laws dating from 2021 that “leave no room for discretion in implementation.” In some versions of staking, bankruptcy could put client assets at risk, calling for a tougher, bank-style approach, regulators argue.  In other words, the lack of specific, MiCA-style rules has thrown the industry into uncertainty. Authorities have, in effect, forced staking into pre-existing regulatory boxes: either it’s custody, or it’s banking.  But it’s not just Switzerland where an overly blunt approach is causing problems. Singapore has forbidden crypto providers from facilitating staking by retail clients. And some EU laws are venturing into the topic, even before defining exactly what it is. The bloc’s newest tax rules, known as DAC8, cover staking, requiring crypto providers to notify tax authorities of any profits their clients make.  “From staking and lending, people can obtain certain gains, and those gains are interesting from the tax perspective,” Luis Calvo-Parra Martínez, an official from the tax arm of the European Commission, told the same event, adding that “it would be good for legal certainty to have a legal definition for those [services], which now – I wouldn't say is lacking, but could be put more black on white.”  See also: The State of Staking: 5 Takeaways a Year After Ethereum's Merge  Gordon also favors having that legal certainty sooner rather than later – not via heavy-handed and potentially over-hasty regulation, but simply to establish that staking is a low-risk activity to secure a blockchain network.  “I worry that there's a lot of confusion with regulators about ‘staking is a lending product,’ ‘staking is some kind of managed investment product’,” he said. “Moving too fast and too bluntly on staking – and I've seen that a number of international markets, by the way – that would be problematic for the development of the whole space.”  That view is shared by the Cardano Foundation, a nonprofit which promotes one of the major blockchains that use staking as a way to validate transactions.  According to Frederik Gregaard, the Foundation’s chief executive officer, the situation in Switzerland is fixable, and derives from the rival Ethereum blockchain switching to a proof-of-stake validation system.  Regulators’ concerns grew given the size and significance of Ethereum, together with the fact that staked ether (ETH) can’t always be returned immediately and could be lost all together, meaning the service resembles bank deposits rather than custody, Gregaard told CoinDesk.  Finma officials “have been very clear and said, what we're worried about is the lock-in period, and we are worried about the slashing … and we don't have any of that in Cardano,” Gregaard said. “My hope is we'll get to a situation where they will say … staking that does not have those features, we will deal with as we did before.”  Gregaard’s positive about the discussions he’s had with officials in the EU, and with regulators in the U.K., where the government has also floated the idea of new staking rules.  But if greater clarity would be welcome, he’s also worried about acting too soon – particularly if staking gets treated as a financial service, with all the heavy-handed treatment that implies.  “We have some time to basically show a lot of non-financial use cases …. it's not just capital markets and banking regulation,” he said. “The space is still a little bit immature … the majority of the really great use cases haven't gotten to escape velocity yet.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/28/europes-crypto-industry-wants-staking-clarity-as-regulations-loom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70761bb7820b279da5b9935681abd8f8860b3294-1617x1071.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Notably, the ratio of LOOM tokens on exchanges has plummeted by 20.8% in the past five days, now standing at 14.9%. This reduction in circulating supply on exchanges hints at the possibility of an extended rally for LOOM, as demand continues to outpace the available token supply. The Crypto Market’s Rapid Evolution The altcoin market is a dynamic and ever-changing landscape, where even lesser-known projects can swiftly rise to prominence under the right conditions, leading to substantial gains for investors. A separate report describing LOOM’s remarkable rally has once again highlighted this phenomenon. LOOM, alongside ImmutableX (IMX) and Frontier (FRONT), has emerged as one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies of the week. This surge in popularity aligns with the growing demand for new crypto wallet addresses being created within the network. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $26.490. Chart: TradingView.com Insights and Implications As the crypto market continues to rise above expectaions, altcoins like LOOM are proving their mettle with significant price surges.

42419501,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEk4z,1695912936,"Judge Denies Temporary Release For Sam Bankman-Fried, Suggests He Could Face 'Very Long Sentence'","NEW YORK — Sam Bankman-Fried will have to remain in jail for the duration of his trial, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, saying that the former FTX founder has had enough time to review material in preparation for the trial. But, Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled, Bankman-Fried will be made available to his attorneys at 7:00 a.m. ET every trial day with a caveat so they can discuss any issues before testimony begins.  Bankman-Fried's attorneys already lost two bids to have their client released from jail ahead of trial. They still tried again this week, arguing they would have no opportunities to confer with the former FTX executive after the end of a trial day. They also offered a strict set of limitations that Bankman-Fried would agree to, including around-the-clock supervision and zero access to computers, phones or other electronics.  Prosecutors pushed back in a filing yesterday, saying Bankman-Fried and his lawyers had not met the burden of proof showing a temporary release was ""necessary."" Moreover, they said the proposed plan to have a guard watching over Bankman-Fried may not meet the legal requirements for a temporary release.  Cohen, the lead lawyer representing Bankman-Fried, said that he would have “almost no time” with the former FTX CEO to speak with him before the trial and that now “is the appropriate time” to ask for a release.  “I’m really not entirely persuaded by the argument [defense attorney Mark] Cohen makes,” Judge Kaplan, who is overseeing the trial, said. ""They're not going in cold here.""  Scenes From Court  Attorneys for Bankman-Fried and the government were all smiles before Thursday's hearing began, chatting amicably with one another as they waited for Judge Kaplan to enter a courtroom on the 21st floor of the Southern District of New York courthouse in New York's Financial District. Bankman-Fried, meanwhile, sat the hearing out from behind bars at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center – which his lawyers have previously deplored for its dietary standards and poor conditions.  Once Kaplan – a no-nonsense jurist who has overseen cases involving a former president and terrorists – entered from a door at the front of the courtroom and brought the hearing into session, the friendly rapport between opposing counsel took a pause.  Following brief introductory remarks from Kaplan, Cohen stepped up to a lectern and argued his client should be released from prison for the duration of his trial. It didn't take long for Kaplan – who has denied similar requests in the past – to make clear that he wasn't convinced things were so different this time around.  When Cohen noted that Bankman-Fried does not present a flight risk, Kaplan interjected that he was skeptical. “I’ve wondered about that,” the judge told Bankman-Fried’s lawyer. “Your client could be looking at a very long sentence,” he said, adding that Bankman-Fried is still relatively young at just 31 years old. “If things look bleak … if he had that opportunity, maybe he would seek to flee.”  As to Cohen's argument that Bankman-Fried's case is complex, meaning he deserves ample time outside of prison to strategize, Kaplan again demurred. While the FTX case ""involves subjects that to the lay world are pretty arcane,"" like cryptocurrency and finance, said Kaplan, ""the issues in this case are pretty straightforward: Was there fraud, or wasn't there?""  Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Kudla, in her remarks to Kaplan, said Bankman-Fried has had ""ample opportunity to prepare for trial."" In addition to the option for daily meetings with his lawyers, Bankman-Fried's bail wasn't revoked until July – meaning he had more than seven months to review evidence from the comfort of his Palo Alto, California home.  Though Kaplan ultimately denied Bankman-Fried's petition for release from prison, he said he was ""committed to a fair trial"" and did make some accommodations for the disgraced crypto founder. Specifically, Kaplan said he would order Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center to produce Bankman-Fried for his lawyers at 7 a.m. on days containing or following witness testimony.

42419515,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEkHN,1695911136,FTX Bankruptcy Claims Soar in Value in Over-the-Counter Markets as Estate Recovers $7.3B,"The expected payout to FTX creditors has more than tripled this year after a successful asset recovery.  FTX marshaling over $7 billion of assets, its valuable stake in Amazon-backed AI-startup Anthropic and the potential restart of the exchange contributed, Matrixport said.  The optimism about improving recovery pushed the bankruptcy claims market into a frenzy.  The crypto exchange FTX’s bankruptcy has been characterized as one of the messiest in U.S. history. Legal fees in the bankruptcy case have already topped $200 million. Founder CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial is scheduled to get under way next week.  But in over-the-counter markets where investors trade bankruptcy claims, the level of expected payouts for FTX creditors has more than tripled this year – reflecting success in the estate’s efforts to recover billions of dollars of assets.  According to data gathered by Matrixport, a crypto services provider that is tracking the market, the expected payout for creditor claims against FTX has surged to an average of 37 cents on the dollar, its highest since the bankruptcy filing in late 2022, and up from just over 10 cents at the start of 2023.  “This development is promising news for all FTX creditors,” Matrixport analysts wrote this week in a report.  When a company declares bankruptcy or files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as FTX did in November, creditors who choose not to wait until the resolution of proceedings to get money back can dispose of their credit claims to speculators focused on distressed assets. The price of these claims often serves as a proxy for the expected recovery for victims.  The expected payout, as it looks now, represents a remarkable improvement since the aftermath of FTX’s bankruptcy filing. Last November, creditors offered their claims at only a few cents on the dollar and almost no one was buying them, CoinDesk reported.  How did FTX recover $7.3 billion of assets?  Matrixport attributed the improvement to the successful efforts to recover and claw back assets.  FTX reported earlier this month that under John Ray III’s leadership, the veteran Wall Street bankruptcy lawyer who is shepherding the exchange through the bankruptcy process, had managed to marshal $7.3 billion of assets, including $3.4 billion in crypto and $200 million worth of real estate on the Bahamas.  “The FTX recovery process appears to be largely complete, amounting to $7.3 billion, with only minor donations – such as to Stanford University – still pending,” the report said.  There might be some additional clawbacks that could improve creditor payouts, Matrixport said, such as a $2.1 billion claim against once-rival crypto exchange Binance and another $700 million claim from investment firm K5, related to Michael Kives, a former aide for Bill and Hillary Clinton.  The company also holds a highly-coveted $500 million stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic, which the exchange used customer funds to acquire so creditors have a claim on it. FTX explored the sale of the stake, but decided to halt the process in June. This might turn out to be a savvy move, as tech giant Amazon has said it plans to invest up to $4 billion in the startup earlier. Amazon’s investment “could lift the value of FTX creditor claims,” Matrixport said.  Lastly, a potential restart of the exchange – often referred to as FTX 2.0 – could be promising for creditors.  “The successful recapitalization of an exchange has been achieved before, with every creditor becoming an equity owner,” Matrixport said. “Understanding this dynamic could be of material significance to claims holders.”  FTX claims market fires up  “The market is so hot that distressed asset investors are absolutely clambering over each other for claims.”  Improving chances of recovery unleashed a new wave of demand for FTX creditor claims among distressed asset investors, market participants told CoinDesk.  “FTX [claims] are probably the hottest ticket in town,” said Thomas Braziel, co-founder and managing partner of distressed asset investment firm 507 Capital. “The market is so hot that distressed asset investors are absolutely clambering over each other for claims.”  He said that the market activity for FTX claims dwarfs that of other bankrupt crypto firms, constituting 90% or even more of the overall trade volume.  The guide price for FTX claims was recently around 35-40 cents on a dollar on Claims Market, a bankruptcy claim marketplace operated by distressed asset investor Cherokee Acquisitions.  The court update about the $7.3 billion assets recovered was a pivotal moment for claims investors, according to Brian Ferrara, director of Cherokee Acquisition’s Claims Market.  “We have seen several new buyers step into the market after FTX's Sept. 11 Stakeholder Update and meetings, which has increased competition,” Ferrara said in an email.  Markus Thielen, Matrixport’s head of research and strategy, explained that the actual price of a claim may depend on different factors such as jurisdiction, size and “cleanness” of the holder.  “There’s a big bifurcation going on in the market,” 507 Capital’s Braziel said, with larger claims changing hands at a much higher price than smaller ones. The “clean, small” claims under $1 million usually trade anywhere between 15 and 25 cents on the dollar. Claims over a million are priced at low 30s, while $5-$8 million tickets could sell in the 40s.  Regardless of size, claims have multiplied in price since FTX’s bankruptcy filing, and it's due to John Ray III’s efforts to recoup assets, according to Braziel.  “All eyes are on John Ray,” he said. “[He] is going to take all these distressed asset guys to promise land.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/28/ftx-bankruptcy-claims-soar-in-value-in-over-the-counter-markets-as-estate-recovers-73b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47bc8affa73fae14a97749d898bba47428b2843f-850x479.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419518,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEkIP,1695910419,Ethereum Staking Surges to 7.4M ETH and Counting,"It has now officially been one year since the Ethereum Merge. Last year, the Merge upgrade ushered in the advent of a new era for not only the Ethereum network but for the broader staking landscape, as the world’s second-largest digital asset transformed from proof-of-work asset into by far the largest proof-of-stake digital asset by market value (worth approximately $200 billion at time of writing).  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Staking Week."" Chen Fang is the chief operating officer of BitGo.     The transition to proof-of-stake not only significantly reduced Ethereum’s energy intensity, it allowed a larger number of holders to participate in the network and to earn rewards for validating transactions and securing the network by staking their holdings.  These rewards are no small matter — the recent Q2 2023 ""State of Staking"" report from Kraken finds that total staking rewards for all cryptocurrencies grew to $5 billion on an annualized basis during the quarter.  Staking can thus help to soften the blow of a bear market, allowing holders to weather the storm until asset prices return to more attractive levels  Staking is growing into a massive ecosystem, with the report showing that the top 35 proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies combine for a market cap of $288 billion, and that there is now $68 billion worth of value staked in these assets. One year in, it's clear staking continues to be an attractive option for Ethereum holders.  Generating competitive rewards in a risk-off market  The primary appeal of staking, in addition to helping to secure and further participate in the network, is that it creates the ability for participants to earn rewards on their holdings. Last year’s bear market or ""crypto winter"" was a painful downdraft for many crypto investors, as rising interest rates and the implosion of FTX caused broad losses across the market.  But just as equity market investors turn to more defensive stocks with higher dividend yields like utilities and consumer staples during times of turmoil, staking is an appealing strategy for Ethereum and proof-of-stake token holders during a risk-off market environment. Staking allows these holders to generate a return while retaining their assets.  With staking, holders no longer need to sell in order to generate a return. Staking can thus help to soften the blow of a bear market, allowing holders to weather the storm until asset prices return to more attractive levels.  According to Ethereum.org, the current annual percentage rate (APR) for staking is 3.9%. The rate has declined slightly as the number of validators has increased, but with MEV Boost (the middleware validators use to increase staking rewards by selling block space to an open market of block-builders) enabled, the returns are higher, ranging from 4.2% and 5.6% over the past six months.  Over 90% of nodes currently have MEV Boost enabled. Beyond increasing rewards, this feature is also creates competition among block builders, allowing validators to sell their blockspace to the highest bidder. Additionally, MEV Boost democratizes the staking process by allowing smaller validators to participate, which in turn increases the network’s censorship-resistance.  These rewards are competitive with the yields investors can find in traditional yield-bearing financial instruments like 10-year Treasury bonds or dividend stocks. Ethereum’s APR narrowly lags the 10-year Treasury’s current 4.5% yield and easily surpasses the average yield for the S&P 500, which currently sits at 1.5% (though many of the equity market’s most popular dividend stocks sport yields ranging from 3-5%). These rewards put Ethereum in the conversation with these income-producing TradFi assets, and they have been conservative and consistent over time.  Ethereum upgrade: removing barriers to entry  While the Merge transformed Ethereum into a proof-of-stake asset, staking on Ethereum didn’t evolve into its fully-realized form until the Shapella upgradein April 2023. The implementation of Shapella enabled Ethereum stakers to withdraw their holdings for the first time since staking began in December 2020.  This gave early stakers the ability to unlock their holdings and withdraw the staking rewards they had accrued over time, while removing uncertainty going forward. This was of particular concern to institutional investors, who champion liquidity above all else, especially in a market where prices can be volatile.  The benefit of this upgrade is clear, as the amount of Ethereum staked continues to increase over time.  In the run up to Shapella, some market participants and media outlets predicted that there would be a large outflow from staking and sell-off of Ethereum, since some holders had been locked in for almost two years.  However, the opposite turned out to be the case: since the upgrade in April there has been a net inflow of over nearly 7.5 million ETH into staking. This increase illustrates the powerful effect that removing the uncertainty surrounding the time frame for making withdrawals has had on demand for staking.  Further, the percentage of the total supply of ETH that is staked is now 22.4%, up from 14.5% before Shapella. Many Ethereum participants believe that this percentage will continue to increase going forward, perhaps reaching 50% as soon as May 2024.  The number of validators has also surged since the Shapella upgrade, nearly doubling from roughly 430,000 validators right before the upgrade to over 840,000 today.  Entry and exit queues  There were initially long queues to enter staking positions, as stakers jostled for positioning prior to Shapella upgrade going live. These queues were exacerbated when Kraken shut down its staking program as part of a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Kraken stakers exited en masse and migrated to other services, compounding the bottleneck.  As the situation has normalized, the exit queue has reduced by a significant margin from a matter of days to under one hour, meaning that stakers now have the freedom to exit relatively quickly if needed. At time of writing, there are just 27 validators in the exit queue.  At the same time, the entry queue for staking has also decreased since Shapella to more normalized levels from a high of 46 days. The entry queue currently stands at just over eight days, with nearly 20,000 validators looking to begin staking. In U.S. dollar terms, this represents about $1.5 billion worth of ETH sitting on the sidelines and a healthy demand for staking. Other observers expect the proportion of ETH that is staked to increase significantly over the next few years.  One challenge that Ethereum is contending with in the wake of the Merge is that with growing interest in the network and growing desire to participate in it, there are now 840,000 validators. While this is beneficial to the core principle of decentralization, the sheer number of machines and their wide-ranging geographic dispersion inevitably leads to strain on the network, resulting in increased latency and longer waits to reach consensus.  In one way, this is a good problem to have — the number of validators and nodes are growing because interest in Ethereum is growing. However, to improve the experience of using Ethereum from everyone and to compete with other blockchains, Ethereum developers will need to reconcile this issue.  Developers are working on solutions that would fix this problem while still fitting in with the founding principle of decentralization, such as increasing the maximum cap on the number of ETH per validator to 2,048 (up from 32 ETH), which would significantly cut down on the number of machines currently operating on the network.  Looking ahead  While long entry queues for validators are a potential challenge, they also indicate the high demand for staking ETH and are in place to make sure the network is secure. Upcoming upgrades that will bring lower gas fees, greater speed and account abstraction to the Ethereum network are on the horizon, further increasing Ethereum’s appeal.  Network participation has climbed steadily since the transition to proof-of-stake. Before the Merge, there were approximately 205 million unique Ethereum addresses. This number has increased to 245 million today.  The number of unique Ethereum addresses and the number of validators have grown substantially since the Merge, as has the total amount of Ethereum staked, indicating that these improvements are bringing new users into the ecosystem and opening the network to more participants.  With increased accessibility, improved flexibility and UX, the ability to earn rewards and the opportunity to participate in blockchains in a new and meaningful way, staking empowers Ethereum holders and will continue to play a pivotal role in the future of the network.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Chen Fang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/28/ethereum-staking-surges-to-74m-eth-and-counting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/357e6f0e7f979df44805ba50b0d2074df82c21e8-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18146396,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553323,1695909601,IPO Frenzy: What Happens To XRP Price If Ripple Stock Climbs To $600?,"One thing that has emerged that could influence the XRP price has been the possibility of Ripple carrying out an Initial Public Offering (IPO). This would mean that shares of the crypto firm would become publicly tradable like that of Coinbase’s COIN stock. However, even more prominent among investors is the possibility of how high the price of the shares could trade. Financial Expert’s Ripple Video Resurfaces The rumors had first begun with some members of the XRP community talking about a possible IPO. Like rumors are wont to do, it quickly took on a life of its own and grew from there. But the most interesting thing so far has been the resurrection of a video of financial expert Linda Jones talking about a possible valuation for Ripple. Related Reading: Analyst Presents 4 Charts That Prove Crypto Is Not Dead Jones had put forward a valuation of $5.7 billion for a possible stock, which placed the single share price at $35 apiece at the time, using data from the Linqto platform. She points to the XRP in circulation which comes out to over $21 billion. Given this, she believes that Ripple’s stock valuation at $35 is too low. Comparing Ripple to Coinbase which IPO’d at an $86 billion valuation, the financial analyst points out that Ripple stock would be valued much higher. She takes into account the market cap of the XRP supply as well, at which point she arrives at a $107 billion valuation. In this case, the value of Ripple stocks comes out to 20x higher than what they were valued at the time that the interview was made. This would put the Ripple stock at a value of around $600, but with the possibility of being higher as the expert points out Ripple’s valuation could reach as high as half a trillion. According to her, the company has what it takes to be considered a high-value company like Nvidia or Apple. What Happens To The XRP Price In This Case? If a Ripple stock were to be released and it reached as high as Jones’ calculations present, then there is more than enough reason for the XRP price to rocket alongside the stock price. In this case, Ripple would be the first public company to have a cryptocurrency, so there is really no historical data. However, some similarities can be drawn from Bitcoin’s connection to the stock price of Bitcoin mining companies. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Huge Double-Digit Breakout For Bitcoin Price When the price of Bitcoin rallies, the stock price of Bitcoin mining companies have often followed suit. This is often because a surge in faith in one translates to a rise in faith in another. Applying the same logic to Ripple and a surge in the stock price would likely result in more interest in the underlying cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in the XRP price. If the stock price eventually climbs above $600, then it is not out of the ordinary to expect the XRP price to cross $5 at least. Additionally, there would likely be a strong correlation in the performance of both assets, so a drop in one could mean a drop in the other, and vice versa.

Recent court ruling favoring Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's ability to convert to an ETF suggests ETHE may follow a similar path. The SEC may not appeal the ruling due to its clarity and logic, and delays due to a potential government shutdown. Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) is a fund that holds the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH-USD). Currently that fund trades at a 32% discount to Net Asset Value. Hence if that NAV discount were too close to zero and the price of Ether was unchanged the fund could see a 47% return. With the recent court ruling last August that strongly favored sister fund Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) ability to convert to an Exchange Traded Fund, there's reason to think that ETHE may ultimately be on a similar path. The markets may be worried that we are still in the 45-day window for the SEC to appeal the ruling. However, the ruling appeared categoric and it's unclear how the SEC might challenge it successfully. Also, time is running out, if the government were to shut down on October 1, then the SEC would likely be operating with a "" skeletal "" staff according to Chair Gary Gensler. That would make it hard for the SEC to file a legal challenge after this Friday, if indeed the government does shutdown. The legal ruling came on August 29, 2023. 45 days after that is Friday, October 13. The SEC had already challenged the Ripple ruling by this point after the ruling, so there are reasons to think that the SEC may not challenge the ruling on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Let's unpack the logic of that assertion. The Ruling Appears Definitive Perhaps the strongest reason to believe an appeal is not coming is the ruling was pretty clear that spot products and futures products based on the same underlying instrument are basically the same thing and 99.9% correlated. Therefore for the SEC to allow a Bitcoin futures ETF and block a spot Bitcoin ETF was inconsistent. It's hard to see how the SEC argues against that logic, and they would need something to base an appeal on. It's unclear what the grounds for appeal are, the Ripple ruling was far more nuanced in comparison and importantly had follow on impacts to other areas of the SEC's work and legal battles, that's less true about the more focused spot Bitcoin ruling. The SEC Has Been (So Far) Slower To Appeal Compared To The Ripple Case The Ripple ruling was appealed on August 9 after a ruling on July 13. That's 27 days to appeal. If the SEC were on a similar timeline, they would have appealed the court's decision this Monday, September 25. Of course we're still close to that timing, such that an appeal could come this week, but if not then maybe an appeal is less likely. A Government Shutdown May Impede the SEC's Ability To Appeal Lastly, but significantly if no appeal is filed by this Friday and the government shuts down next Monday, then the SEC may not have the resources to mount an appeal before the apparent October 13 deadline. Of course, much depends on whether a shutdown occurs and how long it could last, but it's hard to see the SEC mounting a legal appeal without a full slate of working staff and even once the SEC staff are back, the backlog and disruption from any shutdown lasting more than a day or two, might impede the SEC getting a challenge launched before the deadline. What Happens Next If there is no appeal, then the SEC should ultimately follow the court's ruling and allow a spot Bitcoin ETF, likely from Grayscale and potentially many other providers. Of course, the ETFs themselves still needs to be reviewed and that's a slow process that the SEC has so far dragged its feet on and could easily take a few months. Plus it's likely that Grayscale may need a vote from fund holders in order to achieve a conversion. It's very likely that this would be supported, but it could add weeks to the process. Still, that should bring the NAV discount on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust from 23% to zero, for an almost 30% return (notwithstanding any moves in the Bitcoin price). The reason is because ETFs have mechanisms to trade at NAV buy creating or redeeming units depending on the direction of the deviation from NAV. If you look at ETFs, you'll see that a deviation from NAV of even 1% is pretty unusual. The Implications For ETHE If the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust sees value in ETF conversion, then converting the Grayscale Ethereum Trust might be a logical next step. That's why the relatively wider discount on ETHE may be enticing here. The fate of both funds is likely similar. Risks Some have questioned whether Grayscale would really want to move away from fund structures with 2% annual fees to ETFs where fees are generally under 1%. There is certainly a risk that the funds do not convert to ETFs on that logic, however, if Grayscale maintains its fund structure it will likely lose assets to ETFs over time. Therefore, given the prospect of potential market share loss, Grayscale may be better served by leveraging its scale to create perhaps the largest ETFs in the spot cryptocurrency space and enjoying the growth there, even if revenue relative to assets does decline. There are still over two weeks for the SEC to appeal, and they may do so, especially if the government does not shut down. The SEC may accept the legal ruling, but find other ways to block a spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF on other procedural grounds if they wish to. As a regulator they do have substantial power and leeway, and it's quite rare for the courts to impede on that. Even if Grayscale embark on a spot Bitcoin ETF, a Ethereum ETF conversion may not follow. Grayscale funds are volatile following volatility in the cryptocurrency space and currently relatively high fee products. That creates risk for fund holders even if the NAV discount does close as returns need not be positive if the price of the underlying asset declines. Conclusion It is interesting that the NAV discounts for some of Grayscales fund products have widened recently despite the apparently positive legal ruling. The market may be expecting an SEC appeal of the ruling, which would push out any ETF conversion timeline and jeopardize conversion. However, the ruling appears robust and the SEC may be running out of time to appeal. Therefore, come next week, especially if there is a government shutdown it may make sense to look at Grayscales Ethereum Fund as Grayscale's major cryptocurrency may be on a path to close their discounts to NAV perhaps in the first half of 2024 with ETF conversion.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4637905-grayscale-ethereum-trust-widening-nav-discount-opportunity?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18146353.jpeg

42419507,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEkBB,1695907576,Crypto Observers Warn of Risk Aversion as Oil Prices Top $93,"Oil prices have jumped to new 2023 highs this quarter.  Inflation could rebound with higher oil prices, forcing the Federal Reserve to continue raising rates, a bearish outcome for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The present situation, though, may not be similar to the 1970s inflation crisis.  Investor appetite for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, has significantly weakened over the past 18 months, with central banks aggressively increasing borrowing costs to tighten liquidity and tame inflation. While price pressures have subsided this year, the situation could worsen again due to the recent rally in oil prices, according to some crypto observers.  The per barrel price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, has surged by 30% this quarter, topping the $93 per barrel mark for the first time in 2023.  ""This [oil rally] will feed into core inflation and hurt consumption, which should keep rate expectations high while hurting stock valuations. Risk-off,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, told CoinDesk.  Higher oil prices are often transmitted to retail fuel prices, raising key inflation metrics like the Consumer Price Index (CPI). That, in turn, weighs over households' disposable income. Less disposable income means weak consumption, economic growth, and less inclination to invest in high-risk, high-reward assets like bitcoin and technology stocks. It's notable that Bitcoin's positive correlation with stocks has recently made a comeback.  Stickier CPI also means the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks could raise interest rates further and keep them elevated for longer, also denting the appeal of risk assets. U.S. Treasuries already look the most attractive relative to risk assets in over a decade. The Fed has raised rates by 525 basis points since March 2022. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently suggested U.S. rates could go as high as 7% in the worst-case scenario of the economy experiencing stagflation.  ""The impact on inflation will keep U.S. rates higher for even longer, which will keep the U.S. dollar strong, which will also hurt developing economies and oil importers,"" Acheson added.  Rising rates also tend to lead to a rising U.S. dollar, which tightens financial conditions globally, a bearish outcome for risk assets. Historically, bitcoin has mainly moved in the opposite direction of the dollar index.  ""Looking ahead, the recent surge in oil prices will make things even more complicated as it will both worsen the economic slowdown but also push up inflation (or at least reduce the disinflationary trend). Balancing growth and inflation will become even harder, and future interest rate decisions will not only be determined by these two variables but also by central banks' credibility,"" analysts at ING said.  Per Singapore-based QCP Capital, traders should watch out for a potential WTI breakout above $100.  ""One thing to keep closely on the radar is oil - which we believe has taken over as the leader of macro markets, and where a break of $100 will likely kick off the overall risk sell-off in earnest,"" QCP's market insights team said in an update published early this month.  1970s again?  One of the most discussed topics in financial markets is whether the present inflation scare is similar to 1970s, when the U.S. economy saw multiple waves of inflation led by an energy crisis. A repeat of the 1970s would mean stagflation, the worst outcome for risk assets.  Per ING, this time is different, thanks to anemic wage growth.  ""Back then, real wage growth remained positive even during the spikes of the oil crises, which allowed inflation to remain above 7% for more than a decade (1972-84). Indeed, the countries that experienced higher real wage growth for the period also experienced the highest inflation over this period,"" ING analysts said.  ""The current surge in inflation is different in that real wage growth turned negative quickly, which has slowed consumer demand drastically. This makes the chances of a prolonged second spike in inflation much smaller,"" the analysts added.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/28/crypto-observers-warn-of-risk-aversion-as-oil-prices-top-93,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83159f036f8260202b2214305a827075d0aee280-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18144970,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553293,1695906011,Dogecoin Price Revival: How Increasing Demand At $0.060 Matters,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently displayed resilience as it found substantial buying support at the $0.059 level, a zone that has remained unbreached on a daily candle close for nearly a year. This newfound buying activity hints at a potential challenge to the overhead resistance, marking a crucial juncture for the popular meme coin’s price trajectory. The cryptocurrency market often witnesses sideways trends, characterized by a lack of significant upward or downward movement. DOGE appears to be embracing this sideways movement, oscillating between the overhead trendline and the $0.059 mark. This kind of price action typically indicates indecision among investors, with buyers and sellers locked in a tug of war. Related Reading: Shiba Inu At $0.0000072: Sellers Push For Breakout From Compact Zone At the time of writing, DOGE stands at $0.060772 on CoinGecko, displaying a minor 0.1% decline over the past 24 hours and a 3.7% dip in the last seven days. The $0.06 price level carries more weight than just a numerical value; it represents a psychological threshold that has repeatedly seen DOGE rebound from its depths. The question on everyone’s mind is whether it can maintain its reliability this time. Dogecoin Battle With Resistance In the midst of this lateral price movement, DOGE is on a collision course with a downward-sloping resistance trendline. This trendline has already repelled the price on three separate occasions, signifying a formidable defense by sellers at this level. Price analysis shows that should this resistance intensify, DOGE could find itself revisiting the $0.059 support level, reaffirming its significance. Dogecoin is selling at $0.060 today. Chart: TradingView.com Both the $0.059 horizontal level and the overhead resistance are pivotal factors influencing Dogecoin’s price trajectory. Until one of these levels is decisively breached, the price is likely to remain within a relatively tight range, keeping traders and investors on their toes. Consistent Support And Potential Catalysts A separate report highlights DOGE’s consistent trading volume and network activity, indicating a robust support level. This sustained stability could serve as a catalyst for future price movements, potentially propelling DOGE to new heights or solidifying its reputation for stability. DOGE seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Solana Bulls Struggle To Break $21 Barrier – What Lies Ahead? However, it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. While past performance can offer insights, it’s by no means a guarantee of future results. Thus, investors should exercise caution, conduct thorough due diligence, and remain vigilant as DOGE navigates its current price territory. Dogecoin’s recent price action at the $0.059 support level and its ongoing battle with overhead resistance offer critical insights into its near-term trajectory. As the market keeps a close watch on DOGE’s performance, its ability to maintain stability could hold the key to its future price movements, with the $0.06 threshold serving as a psychological frontier that investors and traders continue to monitor closely.

As of 8:23 am ET, the process appeared to be going smoothly, though the developers signaled that the ""participation rate"" would need to reach at least 66% before the launch is finalized.  On a livestream on YouTube from the EthStaker, one of the developers said, around 8:10 am ET, “It looks like the launch is successful.”  “Not going to have to build a third one!” responded another developer on the call.  The new Holesky network is supposed to help developers test some ambitious scaling plans for the main Ethereum blockchain, replacing the Goerli testnet that is currently in wide use. The new testnet will allow twice as many validators to join the network compared to mainnet, and was designed to address Goerli’s testnet ETH supply issues.  The original planned launch date of Holesky, on Sept. 15, was supposed to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Ethereum’s historic “Merge” transition to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake blockchain. But that didn’t happen due to some misconfiguration issues, according to developers.

Holesky will be important for Ethereum’s upcoming hard fork, Dencun, where proto-danksharding, a technical feature which will reduce gas fees, is supposed to go live.

42419516,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEkGL,1695902455,First Mover Americas: MakerDAO Exchange Balance Jumps; CZ Denies He Owns CommEx,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Changpeng “CZ” Zhao on Thursday denied that he is the owner of CommEX, the mysterious company that has bought Binance’s business in Russia. Binance, of which CZ is the founder and chief executive officer, this week announced it was quitting Russia after reports of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into sanctions violations. That led to questions around the identity of CommEX – a company with similar user look and feel to Binance, and which appears to just be a few days old. “I am not their UBO [ultimate beneficial owner], nor do I own any shares there,” CZ said of CommEx in a post on X, formerly Twitter, adding that a few former Binance staff from the region have gone to work for CommEX, or may do so in future.  Blockchain activity tied to MakerDAO's maker (MKR) token is signaling caution to bulls following MKR's 45% price surge in four weeks. The number of MKR held in wallets controlled by centralized exchanges has increased by 5% to 71,190 MRK ($106 million) in the past 24 hours, taking the total exchange balance to the highest since Sept. 3, according to Coinglass. MakerDAO is one of the largest crypto lending protocols and issuer of the $5 billion stablecoin DAI. MakerDAO's sDAI represents DAI deposited in the protocol's DAI Savings Rate (DSR) module. The notable spike in the exchange balance may breed price volatility, mainly to the downside. An increase in the so-called exchange balance is widely taken to represent investors' intention to sell or liquidate their holdings or deploy coins as a margin in derivatives markets.  The European Commission issued an 800,000 euro ($842,000) contract on Tuesday as it seeks to mitigate what it calls “significant harm” of crypto on the environment. The study, for which bids close on Nov. 10, will develop standards that feed into potential future EU policies to curb the impact of crypto on climate change, and to new energy efficiency labels for blockchains. “There is evidence that crypto-assets can cause significant harm on the climate and environment,” potentially undermining the bloc’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the European Commission said in tender documents, which suggest that new sustainability standards may be taken up in future laws.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows credit card default rates at top 100 U.S. banks and rest of the lenders since 1991 and U.S. recessions.  The default rate has picked up across the board, with smaller banks registering a record high of 7.5%.

18143455,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553281,1695902405,"Bonds Out, Bitcoin In? Bloomberg Analyst Predicts Major Portfolio Shifts","In a comprehensive evaluation of global market dynamics, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst and Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Jamie Coutts has opined on the shifting sands of financial asset volatility. With bonds potentially falling out of favor and Bitcoin cementing its place as a debasement hedge, traditional portfolio models may be on the verge of a renaissance. Major Portfolio Shift Towards Bitcoin? Coutts tweeted, “It looks like we are about to see a substantial uptick in volatility across all markets, given where yields, USD, & global M2 are heading. Despite what lies ahead, there has been a big shift in the volatility profiles of global assets vs. Bitcoin over the past years.” A comparative analysis by Coutts highlighted that since 2020, the volatility profiles of Bitcoin and Gold have declined, while most other assets have seen an increase in volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Keep Pushing But Faces Rejection, 100 SMA Is The Key His breakdown indicates that the traditional 60/40 portfolio volatility is up by 90%, NASDAQ’s volatility has surged by 53%, and global equity volatility rose by 33%; meanwhile, only Bitcoin’s volatility decreased by 52% as well as Gold’s volatility, which went down by 6% Coutts further elaborated that following the “hyper-volatile” phase of Bitcoin during 2011-14, the cryptocurrency’s volatility has been on a downward trajectory. From a peak above 120 in early 2018, this metric currently stands at 26.39. However, Coutts maintains skepticism over Bitcoin’s short-term prospects given the deteriorating macro environment: “Given that BTC volatility is near the bottom of the range plus a deteriorating macro environment: US dollar (DXY) is up, 10Y Treasury Yield is up, Global M2 money supply is up. It’s difficult to see how BTC (& all risk assets) can hold up with this setup.” BTC Vs. Global Asset Classes On the bright side, from an asset allocation perspective, Coutts considers the real question to be whether “Bitcoin can add value as a risk diversifier & improve risk-adjusted returns.” Comparing the risk-adjusted returns using the Sortino ratio during the last bear market, Bitcoin’s performance is not the best. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend At Stake: How September’s Close Could Change Everything In the 2022 bear market, Bitcoin’s Sortino ratio is -1.78, positioning BTC above global equities, the NASDAQ 100, and the traditional 60:40 portfolio. However, it trails the S&P 500 (-1.46), European Equities (-1.01), Gold (+0.1), Silver (+0.28), and commodities (+1.25). Elaborating on the cyclical behavior of Bitcoin, Coutts added, “The problem with BTC is the relatively short history makes inferences difficult and 1 year periods are certainly not significant. The best we can go on is multiple cycles. It’s clear that holding over the full cycle has been a winning strategy.” Evaluating the Sortino ratio over the past three Bitcoin cycles (2013-2022), Coutts found Bitcoin to lead with a score of 2.46, outperforming the NASDAQ 100 (+1.37), S&P 500 (+1.25), and global equities (+1.05). BTC: Top Bet Against Money Printing In this scenario, Debasement concerns further enhance Bitcoin’s proposition. Coutts emphasized this saying, “And if allocators want to outpace monetary debasement, over most timeframes, bonds are not the place to be.” He identified Bitcoin as the foremost choice for portfolio reallocation against monetary debasement. Citing the vast difference between asset returns concerning money supply growth (M2) over the past 10 years, he highlighted Bitcoin’s dominance with a staggering ratio of +8,598, followed by NASDAQ (+109), S&P 500 (+25) and global equities (-7.5). In a concluding statement, Coutts postulated, “In the years ahead it’s conceivable that allocators begin to shift towards better debasement hedges. BTC is an obvious choice.” Moreover, he suggests that Bitcoin could supplant bonds by securing at least 1% of the traditional 60/40 portfolio. At press time, BTC traded at $26,433.

The move comes after months of testing.  These contracts will be released on ShimmerEVM, an Ethereum-compliant blockchain. ShimmerEVM is part of Shimmer, an IOTA ecosystem blockchain that allows developers to build applications and use features that are not yet available on the IOTA mainnet, before moving their applications onto the main IOTA network.  Shimmer is a network unveiled in 2022 that will exist as a separate blockchain with its own SMR tokens. EVM refers to an Ethereum Virtual Machine, or the software environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts are live.  ShimmerEVM can help expand IOTA’s appeal among developers and users, as they can run applications or platforms from other chains with minimal to no adjustments to the original code.  Users can also send SMR tokens (and in the future NFTs and custom Native Assets) to the ShimmerEVM through Firefly, no special bridge is needed. Bridges are blockchain tools that help transfer tokens between different networks  The move comes nearly two weeks after key IOTA developers took a series of decisions that benefit network development and, eventually, token prices.

The program in Argentina’s capital is based on a “decentralized digital identity protocol” known as QuarkID, and relies partly on technology from the Buenos Aires-based startup Extrimian.  According to a press release, Buenos Aires citizens starting in October can download the QuarkID wallet “and claim key personal identification documents such as birth and marriage certificates.”  QuarkID users will own their own data and decide how to manage their certificates when it comes to interacting with public services, according to the statement.  QuarkID will make use of Matter Lab’s ZK rollup, zkSync Era, meaning that these documents will use the blockchain as a settlement layer. The product therefore will rely on zero-knowledge proofs to verify that every user’s document is correct.  “With this development, Buenos Aires becomes the first city in Latin America, and one of the first in the world, to integrate and promote this new technology and set the standard for how other countries in the region should use blockchain technology for the benefit of their people,” Diego Fernandez, secretary of innovation for the Buenos Aires City Government, said in the release.  The city also plans to roll out other developments with QuarkID over the next few months.  In November, proof of income and certificates of academic attendance will go live, which will be needed if citizens want to claim benefits.  The Buenos Aires government will also share its anticipated roadmap by the end of the year, aiming to sign up 2.5 million citizens to use QuarkID wallets.  “We’re excited to be part of this initiative that sees the first major country push a digital ID solution to its citizens,” said Omar Azhar, head of business development at Matter Labs, in the press release. “The City of Buenos Aires is leading the way with this innovation and setting an important precedent in the region.”  Read more: Matter Labs Opens zkSync Era to Users, Claiming First in ‘Zero Knowledge’ Tech on Ethereum",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/28/buenos-aires-releases-blockchain-digital-identity-solution-powered-by-matter-labs-zk-proofs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d67f9ee3bf493b1b27dc428a91862fa9a3951d1-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following the collapse of FTX last November, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges faced several questions regarding their organizational structures, not least among them the separation of business lines such as trading, financing and custody, akin to how traditional financial firms operate.  Adoption of this business practice in the digital asset industry is likely to be an important tenet of the regulatory oversight that many crypto firms are now seeking.  London-based Zodia Custody, which is owned by multinational bank Standard Chartered (STAN), is one of the firms offering products that would enable exchanges to comply with such rules. Zodia's Interchange allows clients to keep their assets on its platform, while their holdings are mirrored and available on an exchange for trading.  Bitfinex was subject to one of the most infamous hacks in the history of crypto, which saw 120,000 BTC (worth over $3 billion in today's prices) stolen in 2016.

42419499,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEjyn,1695902034,Does Lido Control Too Much Liquid Staking?,"Things move fast in crypto land, even during “crypto winter.” Just over a year ago, Ethereum still operated using Proof-of-Work, meaning that exactly 0.000 ETH were “staked.” Once Proof-of-Stake roared to life, it turns out people liked earning rewards and now, incredibly, over 20% of all ETH are committed to the network via staking.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Staking Week"" presented by Foundry.  The one clear downside of staking, of course, is that your Ethereum is unavailable. This led to the world of liquid staking, where you receive what’s effectively a “shadow token,” such as stETH (staked Ethereum), in exchange for the ETH that you’re committing to the network, and then you can use (or invest) the new token, all while earning rewards on your underlying asset. “Originally you were not able to withdraw your Ethereum, and it was stuck there. Liquid staking had a perfect product-market fit,” says Marin Tvrdić, the protocol relations contributor for Lido, the largest liquid staking protocol.  But is this too good to be true? Can getting freebie tokens create too much leverage? And are there hidden risks in the system? “If someone tells you there's no risk, they’re lying,” says Tvrdić over a recent Zoom call. “There’s always risk. Even if you hold native Ethereum, there's risk.” Tvrdić shares this and other staking real-talk, including why Lido is more decentralized than people realize, what he envisions as the future of staking, and why we might get to a world that is “over-staked.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What’s the mission of Lido?  Marin Tvrdić: Lido's primary mission is to decentralize Ethereum. And how the protocol operates is to distribute staking across multiple node operators, and as evenly as possible, as safely as possible. It's never concentrated on one node operator. It's spread across.  How would you describe the magic that’s required to pull this off?  Not the DAO, nor the protocol itself, holds custody of users’ ETH, or staked ETH. At no point is it a custodial solution. At every single point in time, from the moment ETH enters the protocol and gets deposited on a validator, it's self-custodial.  Without getting too deep in the weeds here, how does it work? Is it a system of smart contracts that automatically allocates all of the ETH across different node operators?  Exactly as you said. It's a set of smart contracts that route Ethereum from the end-user, through node operators, to specific validators. And it operates in a permissionless manner, and no one, no human person, has any interactions, at any point, with the protocol. So, it's fully, fully, fully smart contract-managed. And best of all, contracts are open-sourced, so anyone at anytime can come and audit everything by themselves.  If someone tells you there's no risk, they’re lying  There has been a massive uptick in both staking and liquid staking. Do you have any sense of who’s doing this, exactly? Institutional investors, or just regular people with a bit of Ethereum lying around? And do you know where they are geographically?  Geographically, it's global, right? And specifically, the Lido protocol is something that I'm proud to say is a protocol for everyone. You get institutional-grade security, but even retail users can deposit their one or two ETH, because they don't have that huge financial barrier to actually enter and stake. That’s opening up the gates for adoption.  If you observe the Lido protocol itself, and interactions it has on the blockchain, which is publicly visible, there are crypto-native institutions that interact with it. There is exposure to the more traditional institutions, because stETH, in this form, is the only asset on the market that’s institutional-ready. Because it's liquid. No other competing product has the same liquidity, thus the institutional side gravitates towards Lido liquid staking.  What do you mean, exactly, by institutional infrastructure? Can you give a concrete example?  If I’m an institution, why would I choose the Lido protocol? It's rather simple. It's the most liquid. It handled over $1 billion of withdrawals. No other liquid staking protocol on the market handled that amount of withdrawals. That's really, really important.  When you're an institution, you want to be sure that you can access your Ethereum at any point of time, right? So, it really is a robust and battle-tested protocol, because it currently has $14 billion worth of Ethereum in the underlying protocol. It signals battle-tested and readiness. And also, nine audits were done for the Lido V2 upgrade. No other protocol is pushing so hard with security audits.  Critics worry that if too much Ethereum is staked with Lido, that could harm the network. How do you respond to this?  The concern is that if Lido goes over 33% of total ETH staked, that could harm the network. I’d say that’s more of a marketing campaign to slow Lido’s growth, to allow competitors to catch up.  When you go into Ethereum mechanics, it’s true that with 33% of the network, you can affect the network finality. Blocks would not be closed, theoretically.  But in reality, Lido would need to make 37 entities [the decentralized node operators] do something that’s really bad for the protocol itself. It’s a bit silly to think that Lido DAO has that power; it doesn’t.  Even if it did have that power, what people don’t understand is that the node operators are concerned about slashing. [“Slashing” is a penalty for validators, in Staking, if they in some way misbehave — the Staked Ethereum is “slashed” or removed.] If they’re affecting finality [and hurting the network], they get slashed. When they get slashed, they lose Ethereum from their validators, which means end-users are losing their Ethereum, which means node operators are losing their source of income. So why would one actually try to do that? It doesn’t economically make any sense.  Got it. You’ve already touched on this a bit, but how do you respond to those who worry that Lido is too centralized?  So, imagine a reality where there's no Lido. It would be completely ruled by centralized exchanges. What Lido does currently, as a protocol, is bring balance to the ecosystem. It diversified a number of entities, and that's how it de-risks the attack vectors on the Ethereum itself.  There was a reality when centralized exchanges dominated. They controlled Ethereum, and that's where Lido actually blossomed. Because it helped decentralize the network, and everyone loved it.  See also: How Staking Rates Can Drive the Crypto Economy Forward | Opinion  And what no one talks about is the Lido protocol is currently the only one that's sustainable. Now. Today. Covering all the expenses, and being able to maintain the security level required for institutions, for retail, for essentially Ethereum itself, while others are operating on VC money. The more the staking grows, the lower the rewards will be. That's how the mechanics of Ethereum work. So if we increase dramatically the number of Ethereum staked, rewards will go down. And that means none of these protocols would be sustainable.  Isn’t there a paradox here? To your point, as staking grows the rewards will come down. If we get to a world where everyone is staking, does that mean the rewards are eliminated, which would mean no one wants to stake?  So it can never be 100% staked, because, in that case, no one would have Ethereum to pay the gas, right? There's going to be a sweet spot. The market will find its fit. At some point, I think we will be over-staked, in terms of staked Ethereum, and it will give less rewards, and then people will start actually withdrawing Ethereum from staking, because it doesn't make sense. And then we will find balance and continuity.  What's your guess of when we get to over-staked?  That’s super-hard. Honestly. Because Ethereum itself, as a network, is also a living thing. I expect tweaks to the actual network to make it more sustainable for everyone.  Let’s talk about leverage. One of the advantages of Lido, or any liquid staking, is that when you commit your Ethereum to the network, you then get a liquid token in return, and then you can go and do other things with it.  In theory people could deposit their liquid Ethereum (stETH) into another protocol as collateral, and then get another liquid token in return, and then go and deposit that token into a third protocol, and so on. Or “yield farming” as some call it. Doesn’t this kind of over-leverage introduce risk, and isn’t it bad for the system?  Hmm. So, I wouldn't call it yield farming, because it's not actually a currency, and you're not consuming structured financial products. And it’s the user who actually puts his asset to additional risk by over-leveraging.  And it's on a protocol level to stop it. For example, on a lending market, to put caps, to avoid cascade liquidations. The market, at this point, is mature enough to have large protocols that actually take care of that kind of security, and prevent users from doing something they don't understand, or getting too greedy and endangering everyone. So there are some limitations imposed.  It’s a bit silly to think that Lido DAO has that power; it doesn’t  Putting over-leverage aside, how about the broader risks here? There have been many, many examples in crypto where a system looks “risk-free” but then somehow implodes or melts down, costing users millions. How do you think about the inherent risk of Lido?  In terms of smart contract risk, it's ever-present. If someone tells you there's no risk, they’re lying. There's always risk. Even if you hold native Ethereum, there's risk. When there's a network upgrade, there's risk that something goes wrong.  But that's the base risk. And it's very, very, very low risk. And then as you scale, on a protocol level, each smart contract on top is additional risk. Everyone is agreeing on that.  So, then it's up to the user to actually do a bit of research, and decide which protocol actually has the most dedicated attention to the smart contracts and security. Lido has spent almost $2,000,000 on nine audits. I’m not saying it’s the perfect solution, but it’s a solution that contributors are working on, and are working to make it even better. We don't try to compete with weird marketing campaigns. We’re trying to build trust around the Lido protocol, and that goes well with the mission of decentralizing Ethereum.  What does the world look like when staking becomes even more mainstream? And what do you see as the future of staking?  I see it as more simplified, honestly. Currently, even with the Lido protocol, if you just arrived it’s a bit of a steep learning curve. In the future I see it as being seamless. I see it as like the Web2 experience, that we all know from our traditional apps, being brought to the blockchain.  There will be customer-specific applications that will enable interaction in a seamless way. You can already see it through various wallets, on the centralized exchanges, that create super-apps that adopt liquid staking as well. The same will happen on the institutional side.  So, improved custodian offerings, wallets with specific smart contract features, so they can, for example, pick what kind of risk they want exposure to. There are so many things actually happening in the market now, during crypto winter, that I think will change the landscape itself in the future.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | LDO,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/28/does-lido-control-too-much-liquid-staking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bccf70d85d44d97309ab7671b9f51383b4c835c0-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Part of the problem could be the rise in the dollar and the potential attractiveness of US debt as an alternative to crypto yields. I still like ETHE is an arbitrage trade, given the discount to NAV, but I wouldn't rule out lower prices in the short term. It's been a little over a month since I last covered Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and by extension the Ethereum (ETH-USD) blockchain network. With the backdrop of the US Securities and Exchange Commission under pressure to allow a spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETF and the recent applications for a spot Ethereum ETF, it's been interesting to see the Grayscale fund now outperforming the underlying asset on various timeframes. Data by YCharts Over the last six months, shares of ETHE are up over 26% even as ETH itself is actually down. Data by YCharts Since the beginning of the year, we've seen shares of ETHE move from a preposterous discount to NAV near 60% to a less preposterous discount to NAV of slightly over 26%. That discount has since crossed back to roughly 32% as of article submission. In this update, we'll go over some factors that I think should be considered for ETHE investors today. Investment Outflow From an investment flow standpoint, it's been a really underwhelming year for the crypto market. Crypto investment vehicles have experienced net outflow during 8 of the last 9 weeks, totaling nearly $500 million: CoinChares Adding up crypto assets under management for all of the providers, the investment AUM for the industry is currently a little over $32 billion - with almost 67% of that AUM coming from Grayscale alone. Year to date, the total net flow for all providers combined is just $51 million and at the current pace of outflows, the net change year to date will likely turn negative in October. What's interesting is breaking the year to date changes down by asset: Asset YTD Flows AUM (millions $) Change Bitcoin 155 21,609 0.7% Ethereum -113 6,852 -1.6% Short BTC 46 111 70.8% Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) 3 106 2.9% Solana ( SOL-USD ) 26 73 55.3% Ripple ( XRP-USD ) 14 57 32.6% Tronix ( TRX-USD ) -51 24 -68.0% Cardano ( ADA-USD ) 6 24 33.3% Source: CoinShares, as of 9/15/23 Here we get decent data from CoinShares though the company doesn't split every single asset. Not shown in my table above, is an additional $3.2 billion sitting in multi-coin funds and ""other"" coins. With the exception of Tronix, the only individual asset that is actually down from net flow standpoint this year is Ethereum. While this is obviously concerning, I do think there are reasonable theories as to why this might be happening. Inflationary Again Ethereum has once again become an inflationary asset. Following the merge last September, the issuance of new ETH slowed down to the point where more Ethereum was being burned than was being issued. This was largely the case at the beginning of the year. From January through mid-August, we saw a net supply change of -306k ETH. However, this has changed over the last several weeks: 30 Day Supply Growth (Ultra Sound Money) Over the last 30 days, Ethereum has flipped from a deflationary asset to an inflationary asset. Since mid-August, we've seen net supply change in ETH approach +17k. This has presumably been a factor in the recent $200 per coin drawdown seen in ETH over the same timeframe. To be clear, there is still far less ETH in supply since the merge last year. But nothing goes in a straight line and ETH is again inflationary at the moment. This could be having an impact on Ethereum's position as the ""risk free rate"" in Defi: Staking Cap Staking Ratio Reward Rate Real Rate Ethereum $43.1 21.6% 3.90% 3.6% Solana $7.7 71.9% 6.90% -0.4% Cardano $5.6 62.7% 3.10% 0.4% Binance ( BNB-USD ) $4.9 14.7% 1.70% 8.4% Aptos ( APT-USD ) $4.7 84.1% 6.30% -15.8% Source: Staking Rewards, as of 9/27/23. Dollars in billions While still far more palatable than the negative yields seen in Solana or Aptos, Ethereum's 3.6% real rate of return for staking isn't nearly as attractive as it was 90 days ago when it was over 5%. Federal Reserve By comparison, the real yield on the 10-year treasury is the highest it has been in the last 15 years at 2.18%. Given the larger level of short term volatility in something like Ethereum compared to dollars from a purchasing power vantage, the yields on US debt could certainly be having an impact on where even the most risk tolerant investors are putting capital to work. The Block To be clear though, ETH staking remains very strong with approximately 27 million ETH currently in stake. That number has been consistently growing since Beacon Chain was launched a few years ago. But again, the investor outflow from Ethereum this year is definitely something ETHE investors should keep an eye on as it could foretell a reversal in the discount to NAV trend that we've been enjoying over the last several months. I'm not personally there yet, but I do think it's worth considering. Vitalik's Holdings Something else that has generated some buzz is the recent move by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sending 400 ETH to Coinbase ( COIN ), presumably to liquidate those holdings. At $1,600 per ETH, those holdings have a current market value of $640k which is slightly more than Vitalik's recently liquidated position in MakerDAO ( MKR-USD ) that I noted in recent coverage of that coin. On the surface, this might seem bearish and ""Crypto Twitter"" was quick to point that out. But it's important to keep this transaction in context: Arkham Intelligence Arkham Intelligence has Vitalik Buterin's public ETH holdings at nearly 247k coins. With $349 million in ETH still under his control, Vitalik's recent Coinbase deposit amounted to about 2 tenths of a percent of his total ETH holdings. It's a non-issue in my opinion. Summary In August, I said patience would be rewarded in ETHE. I still believe that to be true. But it's worth considering that patience for a better price might be prudent as well. It's admittedly concerning seeing investment demand for Ethereum and Ethereum derivatives go negative year to date. However, I think this is largely due to strength in the dollar and the perception that US debt might be a better alternative than crypto yields. It's also worth mentioning that the Ethereum held in custody for Grayscale is not actively staked. This means there is theoretically an opportunity cost in longing ETHE rather than buying ETH directly and staking it yourself or through a staking provider. I think there's a lot of credence to that idea when ETHE is trading more in line with the underlying asset. For me, ETHE is a very simple arbitrage trade. If we like ETH and we think there will ultimately be a spot ETH ETF in the United States either under this administration or the next one, I think ETHE is still a really great trade at a 30% discount. All that said, it's probably wise to keep an element of patience if the share price moves the other way in the short time.

If bitcoin were to climb to a new all-time high of $70,000 an investor would realize a return of only 167%, the report said. Investors could see larger gains by buying a diversified portfolio of publicly listed bitcoin mining companies including firms, such as HIVE Digital (HIVE), Bitfarms (BITF) and Iris Energy (IREN).  Based on bitcoin’s current price, these stocks are trading at a 33% discount, and offer 52% upside, the note said.  “In our regression analysis, the 10 stocks included could be valued 97% higher if bitcoin returns to $30,000 or an impressive 572% higher if bitcoin reaches a new all-time high and trades at $70,000,” wrote Markus Thielen, head of research.  “For the sake of diversification, opting to invest in a selection of discounted bitcoin mining stocks or tokens with substantial growth potential could possibly represent the ultimate bet for 2024,” he wrote, noting that tokens have considerably more risk than listed stocks.  Matrixport maintains a positive outlook for bitcoin, despite signs that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could delay the approval of a U.S. listed spot BTC exchange-trade-fund (ETF) until January 2024.

The study, for which bids close on Nov. 10, will develop standards that feed into potential future EU policies to curb the impact of crypto on climate change, and to new energy efficiency labels for blockchains.  “There is evidence that crypto-assets can cause significant harm on the climate and environment,” potentially undermining the bloc’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the European Commission said in tender documents, which suggest that new sustainability standards may be taken up in future laws.  EU lawmakers worry about the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism that underpins blockchains such as Bitcoin.  During negotiations last year on the bloc’s Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, they came close to approving green controls that some characterized as a bitcoin ban. Though the final text doesn’t go that far, MiCA does require issuers to declare environmental impacts, using a method that still has to be nailed down.  The EU study, to be produced over the course of a year, will look at green issues like crypto’s use of water, waste products and natural resources as well as energy, the commission said.  Crypto's energy use has also come in the crosshairs of the U.S. government.

With more and more nations exploring issuing a wholesale CBDC Project Mariana wanted to test out how foreign and exchange settlement might look in a world where central banks have issued a CBDC.  The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the central banks of France, Singapore and Switzerland successfully tested out cross-border trading of wholesale central bank digital currencies (wCBDC), according to a report on Thursday.  Project Mariana's proof of concept used a hypothetical euro, Singapore dollar and Swiss franc wCBDCs between simulated financial institutions. The project relied on ""a common token standard on a public blockchain which facilitates interoperability and seamless exchange of wCBDC across varied local payment and settlement systems maintained by participant central banks,"" an accompanying press release said.  With more and more nations exploring issuing a wholesale CBDC - which enable the settlement of interbank transfers - including countries in Europe and Asia, Project Mariana wanted to test out how foreign and exchange settlement might look in a world where central banks have issued a CBDC. Banque de France said in June that wholesale CBDC's could improve cross border payments.  “Project Mariana pioneers the use of novel technology for interbank foreign exchange markets. It successfully demonstrated that it is feasible to exchange wholesale CBDC across borders using novel concepts such as automated market makers (AMM),” said Cecilia Skingsley, Head of the BIS Innovation Hub. AMM's are an autonomous trading mechanism and in this experiment was like a decentralised exchange.  ""The project even used smart contacts to enable central banks to manage their wCBDC without the need to directly operate or control the underlying platform,"" the report said.  ""DeFi (decentralised finance) elements tested in the project, specifically automated market makers, could form the basis for a new generation of financial market infrastructures,"" the press release said.

DOGE could start a fresh increase if there is a clear move above $0.062 and $0.0635. DOGE started a fresh decline and retested the $0.0595 level against the US dollar. The price is trading below the $0.062 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0610 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could struggle to clear the $0.0615 and $0.0620 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Holds Support After struggling to clear the $0.0635, Dogecoin price started a fresh decline. DOGE declined below the $0.0612 level and even spiked below $0.060. A low was formed near $0.0593 and is currently correcting losses, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.0602 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0634 swing high to the $0.0593 low. DOGE is now trading below the $0.0615 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.0610 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0610 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $0.0615 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.0634 swing high to the $0.0593 low. Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com A close above the $0.0615 resistance might send the price toward the $0.0635 resistance. The next major resistance is near $0.0650. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.0685 level. Are Dips Supported in DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.0612 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.060 level. The next major support is near the $0.0595 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.0595 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.055 level.

18140484,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553270,1695895220,Bloomberg Analysts Say Ethereum Futures ETFs Could Start Trading Soon – Here’s When,"According to Bloomberg analysts, Ethereum futures ETFs (exchange-traded funds) could start trading for the first time in the United States as early as next week. This comes just a few hours after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed decisions on Ark Invest and VanEck ETH spot ETF applications. Why Ethereum Futures ETFs Could Launch Next Week On September 28, Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas said – via a post on X (formerly Twitter) – he was hearing that the SEC wants to accelerate the launch of Ether futures ETFs. Balchunas stated that the commission wants it “off their plate” before the potential US government shutdown. The United States government faces a possible partial shutdown at 12:01 a.m. ET on October 1 if Congress fails to pass spending bills for the coming fiscal year, potentially affecting most government agencies’ non-essential operations. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Rejection But Bulls Are Not Out of Woods Yet The Bloomberg analyst claims that, in anticipation of this scenario, various Ethereum futures ETF applicants have been asked to update their documents by Friday afternoon in order to commence trading as early as Tuesday, the 3rd of October. James Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF analyst, responded to Balchunas’ revelation, saying that it appears that “the SEC is gonna let a bunch of Ethereum futures ETFs go next week potentially.” It is worth noting that neither of the analysts divulged their sources for this latest development. According to an earlier note from the analysts, there are 15 ETH futures ETFs from at least nine issuers awaiting the SEC’s approval. In their analysis, Balchunas and Seyffart put forward a 90% chance of Ethereum futures ETFs launching in early October. The note read: Ethereum futures ETFs have a 90% chance of launching in October, we believe, with Valkyrie’s Bitcoin futures ETF (BTF) poised to become the first to hold Ethereum exposure on Oct. 3 after a strategy change. We expect pure Ethereum futures ETFs to start trading the following week thanks to Volatility Shares” actions. Spot Ethereum ETFs In Limbo? Before this latest update on ETH futures ETFs emerged, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission had pushed the deadlines for ARK 21Shares and VanEck’s Ether spot ETF applications. In separate filings, the commission stated that it would designate a longer period on whether to take action on a proposed rule change for the listings of these Ethereum spot ETFs. The SEC said: The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETF: US Lawmakers Jump In With Demands For The SEC The Securities and Exchange Commission also mentioned that it received no public comments on either proposal. Meanwhile, it set December 25 (for VanEck) and December 26 (for ARK 21Shares) as the new deadline for another delay or decision on the Ethereum spot ETFs. The approval of an ETH spot exchange-traded fund is highly anticipated due to its potential positive impact on the Ethereum price, which has been struggling in the past few weeks. As of this writing, Ether is valued at $1,617, reflecting a 1.6% price jump in the past 24 hours.

42419504,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEk1t,1695895200,2 Small Wins For Sam Bankman-Fried,"Wednesdays may become Sam Bankman-Fried’s new favorite day.  After multiple consecutive setbacks for the former FTX CEO and his defense team, Judge Lewis Kaplan seemed to have been in a slightly more generous mood yesterday.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  The once-celebrated crypto mogul will be able to use an “air-gapped” laptop to take notes while in court during the entirety of his trial, which starts on Oct. 3 in New York City, the judge said in a ruling. Because today is Friday junior, I will spare you the Google search for what that means.  Since the laptop is “air-gapped,” Bankman-Fried will have no connection to the internet or local area networks. The computer is physically isolated from unsecured networks, which also means that data can only be uploaded through the computer via USB and the like – in other words, Bankman-Fried will have no way of messaging with reporters or attempting to contact witnesses. All he is able to do is take notes.  Judge Kaplan also ruled that Bankman-Fried can wear suits in the courthouse, as opposed to his prison uniform, which he had worn to some court hearings since being remanded into custody in August. This may help with potential bias from jurors who might unconsciously perceive the FTX founder as an already convicted criminal just by his look if he wore the beige prison garb.  Even though this week marked three wins for Bankman-Fried’s team – Judge Kaplan on Tuesday said he will let Bankman-Fried’s lawyers ask some of the Department of Justice’s witnesses about their recreational drug use and other questions tied to their running of FTX and Alameda Research – these motions seem to be a lot less significant than some of the requests that the defense team had filed that had been denied.  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers, for example, are still fighting to release the FTX founder for the duration of his trial to ensure fairness. Judge Kaplan had previously denied the defense’s motion to release him ahead of his trial. The prosecution late on Wednesday afternoon opposed the latest motion, saying that it “largely recycles the defendant’s generalized claims regarding the manner in which he would like to assist his counsel in his defense,” it said in a filing.  There will be a hearing at 10:00 a.m. ET today on the motion.",NEUTRAL,없음,RESEARCH,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/28/2-small-wins-for-sam-bankman-fried,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance, of which CZ is founder and chief executive officer, this week announced it was quitting Russia after reports of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into sanctions violations.  That led to questions around the identity of CommEX – a company with similar user look and feel to Binance, and which appears to just be a few days old.  “I am not their UBO [ultimate beneficial owner], nor do I own any shares there,” CZ said of CommEx in a post on X, formerly Twitter, adding that a few former Binance staff from the region have gone to work for CommEX, or may do so in future.  Historic transactions between the two companies related to the “testing phase” of integration, and Binance had asked for CommEX to have a similar design and technical features to smooth the transition, CZ added.  In its Wednesday press release, Binance confirmed it had no revenue split or option to buy back shares from the new company, and that it was “fully” exiting Russia with a transition period of a few months.

18138981,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553277,1695891626,Analyst Presents 4 Charts That Prove Crypto Is Not Dead,"As the crypto market faces constant volatility challenges and regulatory pressures, major cryptocurrencies have experienced significant declines and slowed growth over the years. However, a new chart report has revealed that despite these downward trends, the crypto industry is still achieving new milestones in terms of adoption. Chart Reveals Crypto Adoption On The Rise The broader crypto market has been recovering at a snail’s pace since the crypto crash in 2021. Cryptocurrencies were at their peak during this time, and Bitcoin had the highest growth rate, reaching a price of over $60,000 while Ethereum’s price was around $4,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Huge Double-Digit Breakout For Bitcoin Price However, the upward trend was short-lived and the industry was hit with many challenges including regulatory hurdles that restricted its advancement into different regions and market forces which constantly caused instability in crypto prices. Amid all this, DeFi Researcher, Thor Hartvigsen has presented in an X (formerly Twitter) post, chart reports that display the continuous growth in adoption of the crypto industry despite negative trends in the ecosystem. Hartvigsen disclosed the four charts showed an increase in crypto adoption in the industry. One of the charts shows a spike in total daily wallets for users in the Ethereum and Layer 2 (L2) landscape which was previously in a bear market. Another chart reveals a surge in traction in decentralized stablecoins which have been in decline since August 2022. The third chart illustrates Ethereum’s growth rate over the years, surpassing $10 billion in revenue and promoting the emergence of innovative businesses in the crypto industry. The last chart shows liquid staking at an all-time high, growing from $7.9 billion to more than $20 billion in 2023. This report also adds to recent data which revealed a spike in liquid staking platforms in the United States after hitting 370,000 Ether (ETH) in only five days and reaching a new milestone of $20 million staked ether. Total market cap struggles to hold above $1 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Major Incentives Driving Growth Rates The evolution of the crypto industry has been pushed back a couple of years following the Terra Luna crash which saw one of the largest stablecoins declining by 99%. After the LUNA crash, the crypto industry suffered another loss from the FTX descent and insolvency. The industry has been under scrutiny by major regulatory authorities like the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There have also been multiple crypto scams, rug pulls, and cyber attacks over the years on major exchange platforms and marketplaces in the industry.

18137292,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553240,1695887401,XRP Price Set To Skyrocket: Crypto Analyst Predicts 1160% Surge Ahead,"In a follow-up to his previous intricate analysis, renowned crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has unveiled another riveting forecast for the XRP price trajectory. Drawing insights from his recent observations, Egrag points to a potential mammoth rise in XRP’s value, suggesting an impressive increase of 1,160%. This surge, he predicts, could elevate the digital asset’s price to an estimated $6.7, with possible fluctuations placing it within a range of $6.5 to $7. Here’s Why A 1,160% Move For XRP Seems Possible The genesis of this bold prediction lies in Egrag’s methodical approach to analyzing past price surges in XRP. Delving into the historical data, he assessed significant price jumps, specifically focusing on those candles that showcased a remarkable price increase of at least 300% in a single candle in the 4-month chart. Related Reading: XRP Price At Risk? SEC Chair’s Congressional Testimony Fuels Ripple’s Legal Battle The analyst found a total of six parabolic price spikes in the history of XRP that met this requirement. According to him, XRP recorded increases of 1,050%, 530%, 2,222%, 740%, 1,577%, and 841% within four months in the past. Through an average of these significant price moves, Egrag arrived at a potential 1,160% surge. Adding more weight to this forecast, he aligned this prediction with the Fibonacci extension level of 1.618. This is utilized to pinpoint potential resistance levels surpassing the swing high. Using the Fibonacci extension level, the analyst concludes that both indicators predict a similar price range. “This leads us to a tantalizing price prediction of $6.7, nestled within the range of $6.5 to $7. This prediction aligns beautifully with the Fib 1.618 level at $6.5,” the analyst concluded. A Steel Foundation For XRP Price In a foundational analysis preceding his latest forecast, EGRAG CRYPTO meticulously analyzed XRP’s price movements over a 4-month chart yesterday. He unveiled critical insights that now serve as the backbone of his current predictions. This prior analysis was punctuated by the identification of two salient price zones, termed by Egrag as zone A and zone B. Zone A encapsulates a price range from $0.00485 to $0.02483, which predominantly spanned from 2013 until early 2017. Within this zone, Egrag highlighted a robust support band ranging from $0.00485 to $0.00596, which he aptly named the “steel foundation”. What is remarkable about this foundation is its resilience; the price consistently held this level even during pronounced market downturns. Related Reading: XRP Price Analysis: 4-Month Chart Dynamics Decoded By Crypto Analyst Zone B, on the other hand, spans a price spectrum from $0.25939 to $2.00. The steel foundation for this zone was identified between $0.25939 and $0.32630. This foundation has exhibited strong support characteristics since 2017. However, Egrag noted that the combination of a prolonged bear market and external elements like the SEC lawsuit, momentarily nudged the price below this threshold. Furthermore, Egrag underscored that in the 4-month timeframe, XRP’s price never sealed a closing above the $2.00 mark. This observation is instrumental, as breaking this resistance could pave the way for XRP to approach its all-time high of $3.40, which it touched on January 7, 2018. According to the analyst, the $2 mark is the FOMO zone where investors will rush into buying XRP. At press time, XRP remained in its sideways trend of the past four weeks, trading at $0.4956.

Web3 is a decentralized internet that disintermediates transactions and offers a more secure and trustless financial system. Digital assets incentivize ownership of blockchain technologies and can be invested in directly or indirectly through various methods. Abstracting Crypto’s Complexities Crypto has become a divisive term, where it seems investors are either passionately supportive or dismissive of this emerging asset class. Yet we’ve also noticed that very few actually understand this technology. While Bitcoin captures the most attention, its limited use cases make it an outlier vs other digital assets. We attempt to simplify the complexities of digital assets for traditional investors while outlining blockchain’s use cases and advantages over traditional technology and finance. Objectives of Web3 Web3.0 refers to a decentralized internet that performs the same functions as today’s internet but operates without centralized intermediaries. While Web2 giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon disproportionately influence tech ecosystems today, Web3 disintermediates the internet by incentivizing thousands of independent parties to collectively validate and process transactions. Web3 creates a trustless, permissionless, and theoretically more secure internet and financial system with the same breadth of use cases as Web2. Tokenomics of Owning Crypto Digital Assets (crypto) incentivize and represent economic ownership of blockchain technologies. Thousands of digital assets exist with a cumulative market cap exceeding $1 trillion, where 42 tokens have market caps of over $1bn. Digital assets accrue a share of the earnings generated by their underlying blockchain applications. Value is distributed to token holders as a dividend and/or by reducing the number of tokens in circulation (almost like a stock buyback). Ways to Invest in Digital Assets Many digital assets are trading at comparable valuations to traditional equities, and we do not believe this reflects the potential for Web3 revenues to scale by multiples. We outline ways investors can gain direct exposure to digital assets, including via crypto exchanges and OTC/Prime Brokers for institutional trading. Investors can also gain indirect exposure via equities involved in blockchain and ETPs for digital assets. Investment Thesis We view Digital Assets as an emerging asset class that is deeply misunderstood by institutional investors. As investors better understand Web3’s advantages over traditional tech and financial applications, we see greater demand for Digital Assets that earn a share of the economics generated by their underlying Web3 protocols. Web3 and blockchain technology remain nascent relative to their disruptive potential, and revenues can scale by multiples if decentralized applications become mainstream. Blockchain technology enables a wide array of use cases comparable to many internet and financial applications used today. These blockchain applications, collectively known as Web3, facilitate transactions and applications without centralized intermediaries. These decentralized applications offer greater levels of security while reducing risks related to single points of failure and lack of transparency. There are thousands of decentralized applications, and many of these maintain a unique digital asset tied to each protocol. In aggregate, the market value of all digital assets is $1.1 trillion, where many of these assets earn a share of the fees generated by their respective applications. The market values for many digital assets trade at comparable earnings yields as traditional equities; however, we do not believe this valuation reflects the potential for Web3 revenues to scale by multiples. What is Web3? Web3 is a decentralized internet. While today’s internet is dominated by the largest companies in the world (Google, Meta, Apple, and Amazon), Web3 facilitates peer-to-peer transactions without centralized intermediaries. To simplify Web3, we compare the evolution of sending a simple email. Web 1.0. In the earliest forms of the internet, sending an email from one user to another was more decentralized. A user would send a message directly to another user’s IP address. But as use cases for the internet grew (music, videos, money, etc.), it became increasingly complex for users to directly share various types of content. Singular Research Web 2.0. Technology platforms such as Google and Facebook streamline complex transactions for users. When sending an email, users no longer send messages directly. Rather, a user’s email on Gmail is sent to Google’s centralized server and then distributed to the intended recipient’s Gmail account. When sending messages from Gmail accounts to Outlook, Google’s servers will communicate with Microsoft’s centralized servers. Singular Research Web 3.0. Web3 facilitates transactions without relying on centralized intermediaries. For an email, rather than relying on a small group of intermediaries to transfer a message, a Web3 email is processed by a decentralized network of thousands of independent parties. Members of this independent network can range from a single person with a computer to a corporation with warehouses of servers. Singular Research Each member of this independent network maintains its own record of the same email being sent, creating a “distributed ledger” stored across each computer. The email is sent once a certain percent of these independent validators confirm their ledgers align. Because the message is encrypted, only the email’s sender and receiver can read the email. Similar to Web2, where users can complete complex transactions, Web3 supports smart contracts that enable a wide array of use cases. As we explain in the next chapter, Web3 use cases range from decentralized finance (trading or borrowing of assets) to decentralized social media, decentralized physical infrastructure (such as maps and WiFi), and much more. Why limiting centralization is important In the case of sending an email, there are several risks related to relying on centralized intermediaries. These risks are typically related to single points of failure. The intermediary’s server could temporarily go down, causing delays in sending the message. The intermediary’s server could permanently go down in the event it stops providing service. The intermediary could choose to censor the email and never actually send it. The intermediary could abuse its trust and read the private email. As such, when relying on centralized intermediaries, users must place a great deal of trust in them. For example, a business must trust that its bank will custody assets safely. A regional supermarket using AWS must trust that Amazon will not pass sensitive information to Whole Foods. If a politician or activist is using social media to share information, they must trust that the service does not censor them. Web3 reduces these risks by using many independent entities to facilitate transactions. If some independent validators are unable to confirm the transaction or deliberately choose not to, the transaction will still be completed if a large percentage of validators fulfill their duties. As such, transactions face less risk of becoming compromised when the pool of validators is decentralized. This result is why Web3 is often viewed as “trustless” because it relies on a network of entities, rather than a single one, to facilitate and confirm transactions. Blockchain vs. Crypto It seems the broader public acknowledges the merits of blockchain technology, but there’s confusion why cryptocurrencies or digital assets are needed. As just described in our Web3 explanation, blockchain technology facilitates and confirms transactions via distributed networks of validators. However, blockchain technology can also exist without digital assets. Permissioned vs. Permissionless For example, a consortium of banks could create their own blockchain network for trading assets. A dozen banks could create a network where transactions between banks are observed by each bank participating in the blockchain. The group could mandate that transactions are only confirmed when over 70% of participants verify each transaction. This result would reduce the level of trust required between any two banks, thus simplifying transactions with almost instant confirmations rather than the T+2 required for most financial activities today. However, even if 12 banks participate in a blockchain, centralization is not entirely eliminated. For example, nine of these banks could collude for competitive reasons and only process certain transactions. The consortium could also block new banks from participating in the blockchain or kick out certain incumbents. Alternatively, as more participants are involved in the blockchain, risks related to collusion are reduced. If thousands of entities are involved in this blockchain, it becomes very difficult for participants to collude or censor transactions. As such, more open and permissionless blockchains have less risks related to centralization and collusion and is likely why a vast majority of blockchain transactions today take place on open and permissionless blockchains rather than closed/permissioned ones. Messario.io Transaction data on permissionless blockchains is also publically accessible. Because blockchain transactions are stored across multiple independent computers, network participants can access the records of all transactions. In fact, records for most permissionless blockchains are publicly available on internet websites. This level of transparency would have restricted dishonest intermediaries like Bernie Madoff and FTX from misappropriating customer assets. Instead, Web3 users can independently verify their assets are safe. Additionally, because blockchain technology is open source, all users have access to the underlying computer programming and can verify each application’s legitimacy. etherscan.io Incentivizing Permissionless Cryptocurrencies (i.e., digital assets) are used to incentivize participation in open and permissionless blockchains. To incentivize independent validators to facilitate transactions, Web3 users must use a blockchain’s native currency/token to pay fees. For example, if a user wants to transact on the Ethereum blockchain, they must pay network fees in Ethereum’s native currency, Ether (ETH). These fees are used to compensate the network’s independent validators. Singular Research Staking vs. Mining Blockchain validators facilitate transactions and earn rewards via two methods: Mining is used by Bitcoin to validate transactions; however, mining is increasingly uncommon across most blockchain protocols. When Bitcoin (BTC) holders send BTC to other users, they must pay network fees in BTC. Bitcoin’s independent validators use high-powered computers to solve a complex puzzle, where the winning validator facilitates the transaction and is awarded the network fee in BTC. Staking is the most common way transactions are validated on modern blockchains. Similar to Bitcoin, users in a Proof of Stake blockchain will pay network fees in the blockchain’s native currency. However, unlike Bitcoin, Proof of Stake validators put up collateral in the blockchain’s native currency. Instead of solving a complex puzzle, stakers are randomly selected to facilitate transactions to earn network fees. Validators in a Proof of Stake blockchain are more aligned with the value of the native asset. In many blockchains, validators can increase their probability of earning network fees by committing more collateral. As such, the value of fees earned is proportional to the value staked. Some blockchains also “burn” a portion of user transaction fees to reduce the supply of native tokens, thus offering a disinflationary benefit to all token holders. Additionally, blockchains disincentive malicious activity by slashing the staked collateral of dishonest validators. Web3 Advantages over Traditional Tech & Finance Here is a list of fundamental advantages that decentralized applications have over traditional technology and financial intermediaries. Security. Blockchain networks offer better security guarantees than centralized intermediaries. If a centralized intermediary’s security is compromised, then all platform activity is at risk. Alternatively, malicious actors need to compromise hundreds (or thousands) of independent validators to gain control of a blockchain. Settlement speed. The trustless nature of blockchain transactions offers significantly faster settlement times than traditional finance. While traditional financial transactions settle over one to two days, blockchain transactions settle in minutes to milliseconds, depending on the network. Immutability. Once transactions are finalized, they become immutable which eliminates double-spending and chargebacks faced by centralized intermediaries. Cost efficiency. Web3 applications replace complex technology/financial systems with self-running lines of code. This replacement enables significantly leaner cost structures versus centralized intermediaries, resulting in significantly lower transaction costs in Web3. Composability. Assets and applications on a common blockchain can more easily interact than activity between centralized intermediaries. For example, a Web3 user can seamlessly borrow assets from one application and immediately trade the borrowed assets on a different application. Transparency. All blockchain activity is publically verifiable, meaning Web3 users can verify all assets and transaction activity. Additionally, most Web3 protocols are open-sourced, meaning anyone has access to the programming. Self-custody. Web3 is non-custodial, meaning users have sole control over their assets. Web3 applications are also non-custodial, meaning users can interact with applications directly from their self-custodial wallet. coinbase.com, binance.com, kraken.com, uniswap.org, curve.fi",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4637838-special-situations-report-digital-assets-more-than-currency?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18136577.jpeg

With its price oscillating between the lows of $0.0000068 and the highs of $0.0000076, SHIB holders have been eagerly awaiting a breakout from this sideways movement. The question on everyone’s mind: Will sellers succeed in pushing SHIB out of its current zone? Price analysis shows that since mid-August, SHIB has been grappling with a bearish market structure on both higher and lower timeframes. The ominous signs began with a sharp price rejection at the $0.00001 price zone, triggering a cascade of sell-offs that brought the price crashing below the once-strong support at $0.0000080.

Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) plummeted from positive to negative during this prolonged range-bound period. Current SHIB Stats As of the latest data available on CoinGecko, SHIB is trading at approximately $0.000007258220, showing a minor 0.2% decline in the past 24 hours and a seven-day dip of 3.1%. These figures indicate the prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding SHIB. SHIB market cap reaches $4.2 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The $0.0000080 level, which had previously acted as a stronghold for bulls, has now transformed into a formidable resistance barrier due to the sustained selling pressure. While SHIB has maintained a sideways trajectory since this resistance flip, the looming threat of further bearish activity cannot be ignored. A successful bearish breakout could potentially lead SHIB to target the June low of $0.000006, the analysis notes. Conversely, if Bitcoin (BTC) stages a rally beyond $27,000, it might just be the catalyst for an unexpected bullish surge in SHIB’s current range. SHIB Bulls Hold On To Optimism On a more optimistic note, some analysts believe that if SHIB manages to hold support at $0.0000070, in conjunction with an ascending trendline, it could pave the way for a sentiment shift and potential price recovery, aiming for levels beyond $0.00001. The first crucial step towards this ascent is conquering the immediate seller congestion at $0.0000074.

MakerDAO is one of the largest crypto lending protocols and issuer of the $5 billion stablecoin DAI. MakerDAO's sDAI represents DAI deposited in the protocol's DAI Savings Rate (DSR) module.  The notable spike in the exchange balance may breed price volatility, mainly to the downside. An increase in the so-called exchange balance is widely taken to represent investors' intention to sell or liquidate their holdings or deploy coins as a margin in derivatives markets.  ""An inflow of MKR moving to exchanges is something to be cautious of for at least a temporary local top,"" analytics firm Santiment tweeted, noting the recent rise in MKR's price and active addresses.  The previous spikes in the exchange balance, seen in late last month and mid-March, marked interim price tops, as seen in the chart below.  MKR has been on a tear since defending the psychological support level of $1,000 late last month, thanks to its investments in the short-term U.S. Treasury notes, which are now yielding over 5%.  According to data tracked by Parsec, MakerDAO has invested more than $2 billion of its vast stablecoin reserves in U.S. Treasury notes.  ""MKR continues to enjoy a strong first-mover advantage having invested over $2 billion in short-term bonds through off chain structures since February 2022,"" Parsec Research's weekly note dated Sept. 22 said.  ""With such a large RWA [real world assets] portfolio, MKR is able to offer a 5% Savings Rate on DAI and buy back MKR with surplus profits. The success of sDAI and a constant flow of MKR buybacks (thanks to the Smart Burn Engine) has led to continued MKR outperformance relative to its DeFi 1.0 peers,"" Parsec added.",NEUTRAL,MKR | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MKR | TRADING | DAI,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/28/maker-tokens-exchange-balance-spikes-after-45-price-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f4da535f5aa796585f2ffe4903bc387a296aba4-1569x962.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The pair could start a decent increase if there is a close above $1,620 and $1,650. Ethereum Price Holds Ground Ethereum’s price remained well-supported above the $1,580 level. ETH formed a base above $1,600 and recently moved a few points higher, like Bitcoin. There was a move above the $1,620 level but upsides were limited. A high was formed near $1,633 before there was a strong bearish reaction. The price trimmed most gains and revisited the $1,580 zone. A low is formed near $1,583 and the price is now rising. Ethereum is trading above $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1,608 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,633 swing high to the $1,583 low. The next major resistance is $1,620. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,633 swing high to the $1,583 low. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com A push above $1,620 might send Ether further higher in the coming sessions. The main hurdle is still near the $1,650 and $1,660 levels. If the bulls succeed in clearing the $1,660 hurdle, the price could start a decent increase toward the $1,720 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,800. Another Drop in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,620 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,600 level and the trend line. The next key support is $1,580, below which the price could test the $1,540 support. A downside break below the $1,540 support might spark strong bearish moves. In the stated case, there could be a drop toward the $1,450 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.

A high was formed near $26,818 and there was a strong rejection pattern. The price trimmed all gains and declined below the $26,500 level. It even dived below $26,200. A low is formed near $26,100 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. Bitcoin is trading above $26,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $26,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $26,450 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $26,818 swing high to the $26,100 low. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance could be near the $26,650 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $26,818 swing high to the $26,100 low. To start a recovery wave, the price must settle above $26,650. In the stated case, the price could climb toward the $27,000 resistance. Any more gains might call for a move toward the $27,500 level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to start a fresh increase above the $26,450 resistance, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $26,200 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $26,000 level. A downside break and close below the $26,000 level might start another major decline. The next support sits at $25,400. Any more losses might call for a test of $25,000. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.

18131176,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553199,1695870006,Uniswap Unveils Funding Plan For Ecosystem Revamp As UNI Price Hits 4-Month Low,"In a move aimed at advancing their vision of creating a self-sovereign Internet with a permissionless alternative to traditional finance (TradFi), the Uniswap Foundation (UF) has submitted a proposal to secure the second tranche of funding. The desired funding, totaling $62.37 million, will be put to an on-chain vote scheduled for Wednesday, October 4th, with a 10% buffer included to mitigate price volatility. Uniswap Foundation Seeks Community Approval The separation of the funding request into two tranches was initially established to allow the UF to finalize its legal entity and obtain non-profit status from the Internal US Revenue Service (IRS), as the company is based in Brooklyn New York, ensuring clarity on tax implications before receiving the larger portion of funds. The UF obtained this status in the spring of this year, prompting the request for the second tranche. Related Reading: LINK Price Broke Critical Level, Macro Downtrend Behind? Analyst Forecasts The first tranche of funding, approved by Uniswap governance last year, aimed for $20 million but experienced a decrease in value due to a drop in the price of UNI, the native token of the Uniswap Protocol. Consequently, the Uniswap Foundation received $17.3 million worth of UNI, creating a remainder of $56.7 million to be requested in the second tranche. A 10% buffer of $5.67 million has been included to account for potential price fluctuations, bringing the total request to $62.37 million. The Uniswap Foundation plans to receive the funds in UNI, with the amount determined using a 30-day UNI/USD TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price). The pricing and its source will be explicitly noted in the on-chain proposal to ensure transparency in the process. Regarding future operations, Uniswap currently holds 452,534 UNI tokens for employee vesting, valued at around $1.9 million. Factoring in a capital loss of $259,000 and the current UNI price, the UF has approximately $9.24 million remaining for operational expenses, expected to sustain them until Q4 2024. Lastly, according to the proposal discussion, the Uniswap Foundation anticipates revisiting governance in mid-2024 to extend its operational runway. UNI Consolidates Amid Bearish Market Sentiment Uniswap’s native token, UNI, has been consolidated between the price range of $4.198 and $4.311 over the past week. This price stagnation comes from the overall market trend and a bearish macro outlook, with the token experiencing a 0.5% decline in the fourteen-day timeframe. Furthermore, UNI has dropped 9.6% over the past 30 days, reaching a four-month low. In the short term, UNI bulls must defend the current price floor to establish a strong support level. They aim to surpass the resistance walls at $4.418 and $4.487 to break the downtrend structure and potentially rally toward $6.259. It is worth noting that this price level is still below UNI’s annual high of $7.629. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Huge Double-Digit Breakout For Bitcoin Price According to Token Terminal data, Uniswap’s circulating market cap currently stands at $3.67 billion, experiencing a recent decrease of 6.66%. The fully diluted market cap, which considers the total number of UNI tokens that could enter circulation, stands at $4.27 billion, displaying an 8.15% decrease. The total value locked (TVL) in Uniswap, representing the amount of cryptocurrency assets deposited and utilized within the platform, has recently declined by 5.31%. This decline reflects the broader Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector’s challenges.

18129912,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553178,1695866456,Ethereum’s Price Vs. Bitcoin: Can Upcoming ETH Futures-Based ETFs Turn The Tables?,"The Ethereum price is hovering around yearly lows compared to the dominant cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. This decline, notable since September 2022, has brought ETH to trade as low as $1,594 at the time of writing. However, amid the concerns about Ethereum’s notable plunge, there are hints of a potential trend reversal, according to the latest report from crypto research firm K33 Research. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stages Recovery But Can It Overcome This Key Hurdle? Ethereum Price Declines, Underlying Reasons K33 Research, a renowned figure in the crypto analytical space, has been closely monitoring the relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin. Their recent findings highlight a palpable drift in the market’s preferences between these two titans. Ethereum’s native token is under strain, hovering at a trading value near 0.06 Bitcoin. This trend traces back to a pivotal moment in Ethereum’s timeline – its transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus, a migration dubbed “The Merge.” However, Ethereum’s trajectory isn’t solely a product of its internal variation. External market factors have also played their part. The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) sectors have seen their buzz quiet down, which has indirectly cast a shadow over Ethereum’s performance. Lunde, a Senior Analyst with K33, alongside Vice President Anders Helseth, reflected on this scenario in their recent report. The analysts pointed out: Ether has experienced a steady downward trend throughout the year as DeFi and NFT activity has faded. Without any meaningful narratives or adoption stories, ether has struggled to maintain strength versus bitcoin Market Sentiments And Potential Catalysts Furthermore, insights from Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) derivative traders reveal a bearish sentiment towards Ethereum. According to the report, despite a notable 60% surge in open interest since August, the disparity between ETH futures prices and its spot remains considerably lower than that of Bitcoin. Lunde and Helseth interpret this data to suggest that expectations of potential ETH futures ETFs being approved in the forthcoming weeks failed to gain the attention of the CME Ethereum traders. However, not everything appears grim for Ethereum. Despite the bearish landscape, analysts at K33 are optimistic about a shift as the year ends. According to the report, the potential approval of new Ethereum futures-based Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) could reverse this trend. Such financial products could infuse new vigor into the market, attracting more institutional interest and potentially driving Ethereum’s value against Bitcoin. If approved, they could not only bolster the confidence of existing investors but might also lure new participants to the ETH platform.

Meanwhile, other altcoins like AVAX are restricted to professional investors or individuals with a $1 million portfolio. Related Reading: ETH Gate Saga Continues: What Is Lubin’s ‘Piece Of Paper’? Since Hong Kong authorized retail crypto trading in August, the Securities & Futures Commission has placed significant restrictions on the operations of exchanges, including Hashkey.

18127365,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553187,1695859204,Marathon Digital Mines Invalid Bitcoin Block Amid Heightened BTC Volatility,"MARA Pool, the Bitcoin mining pool operated by the publicly listed Marathon Digital Holdings, had a transaction ordering issue on September 27 after it mined an invalid block at block height 809478. The invalid block was first picked by an X user, “0xB10C”, before Jameson Lopp, the CTO of Casa, a Bitcoin-focused company, later confirmed it. Lopp scanned his node and noted that MARA Pool had spent an output before it was created, validating a double-spent transaction. Marathon Digital Mined An Invalid Block In Bitcoin, a mining pool or an individual miner can’t approve an “illegal” transaction originating from any network user. By double-spending, the user posting the transaction tries to cheat the system. Related Reading: LINK Price Broke Critical Level, Macro Downtrend Behind? Analyst Forecasts Bitcoin is self-auditing, and every miner and mining pool connected to the network must always confirm that all transactions in the latest block and attached to the longest chain are valid. If a block contains an invalid transaction not supported by other miners, it will be rejected. This was the case with the block verified by MARA Pool; other miners automatically dismissed it and didn’t build on it. BitMEX Research findings show that the block was disregarded because of a transaction ordering problem. In Bitcoin, miners decide the order of transactions within a block based on the fees attached. All these transactions are picked from the mempool, a temporary storage for all unconfirmed transactions. While they can arrange them in any order, this changes once the block is confirmed after its cryptographic puzzle is solved.

Bitcoin prevents this by automatically proving that only a particular transaction was the first to be confirmed on the network, invalidating any other. Bitcoin Remains Volatile The event also coincided with heightened Bitcoin volatility. At September 27 highs, the coin had soared to as high as $27,263 and remains capped inside a $1,000 range, looking at price action in the daily chart. Nonetheless, the surge was quickly met with strong rejections. The coin fell sharply from today’s highs, and an inverted hammer forms in the daily chart. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin is roughly up 5% from September lows. Buyers have the upper hand since prices are trending inside the bullish range established in the second and third weeks of the month. Presently, prices are trending above the primary support at around $26,000. Looking at price trends in the past few weeks, the path of least resistance is southwards despite the recent revival.
