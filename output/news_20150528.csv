42395295,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaH63,1432848970,Silk Road Operator Ross Ulbricht to Be Sentenced Tomorrow,"Convicted Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht faces life in prison at a sentencing hearing tomorrow in New York.  The end of the trial comes more than a year and a half after Ulbricht's legal battle with the US government first began. Ulbricht was found guilty in February of narcotics, computer hacking and conspiracy charges in connection with his operation of the Silk Road black market.  As reported by Wired, prosecutors asked the court earlier this week that Ulbricht be given ""a lengthy sentence"" to dissuade other would-be dark market operators.  “The court thus has an opportunity to send a clear message to anyone tempted to follow his example that the operation of these illegal enterprises comes with severe consequences,"" the letter read.  In a separate letter addressed to US District Judge Katherine Forrest, Ulbricht asked to be spared from life in prison, acknowledging the severity of his actions but seeking a degree of leniency.  ""I've had my youth, and I know you must take away my middle years, but please leave me my old age,"" he wrote. ""Please leave a small light at the end of the tunnel, an excuse to stay healthy, an excuse to dream of better days and a chance to redeem myself in the free world before I meet my maker.""  Ulbricht's sentencing hearing is scheduled to take place at 18:00 UTC.

42426368,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxzh,1432845923,Dream Lover Now Lets You Pay Bitcoin for Virtual Romance,"Dream Lover, a virtual relationship platform that allows users to send texts and receive pictures from professional models, is now supporting bitcoin as a payment option.  A product of the people behind adult entertainment studio Naughty America, Dream Lover follows in the footsteps of its sister website, which began accepting bitcoin in January 2014.  Launched later that year, Dream Lover allows users to spend bitcoin on account credits called Coins that can be used to purchase access to phone numbers assigned to Dream Lover models. Users pay for 30-day access to the phone number and any transaction fees.  Dream Lover CEO Andreas Hronopoulos described the product as one that seeks to capitalize on what he considers the broader trend of startups enabling both real and fantasy online relationships, citing Tinder as an example.  Hronopoulous told CoinDesk:  ""We don't think about it as adult entertainment, we look at it as people have relationships online and this is just an opportunity to have a virtual companion. I think the movie 'Her' really hit the nail on the head. People want to have relationships online and this is just the beginning.""  Hronopoulous indicated that models on the website are predominantly female, but that the platform is open to all applicants.  Above all, however, Hronopoulous sought to stress that Dream Lover is not an 'adult entertainment' product, but instead a kind of for-profit fantasy social network.  ""The purpose of this service isn't for people to meet,"" he continued. ""It's for users to have somebody to communicate with and who better than the pin-up girls of our generation?""  BitPay  serves as the transactions processor for the service.  Diminishing role  While bullish on the prospect of bitcoin in the adult industry last year, Hronopoulous indicated that he now believes the technology's broader adoption is likely to happen without the help of adult entertainment.  ""Adult entertainment works when you talk about using a medium and having devices which can access it,"" he explained. ""Bitcoin is something different. I don't think adult will play a big role in that, I just think it's another form of payment.""  Conversely, Hronopoulous described virtual reality as perhaps a technology that would be propelled forward by the adult industry. He noted that Naugthy America has gone ""back and forth"" on bitcoin.  Bitcoin payments, he said, are in the process of being restored on the website, though he did not elaborate more fully.  Still, Hronopoulous lauded bitcoin as a technology, indicating he believes it has a lot to offer in terms of the relative privacy it offers purchasers from third parties.  ""I think the idea is strong,"" Hronopoulous concluded. ""Everything comes out with a bang but things take time to grow.

42426369,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMy1h,1432842658,Bitcoin's 'New Frontier' of Cybercrime Explored at Barcelona Event,"Bitcoin attackers present ""a new frontier"" for cybercrime, a gathering of top security specialists heard in Barcelona this week.  Government agencies, banks, universities, private companies and consulting firms attending the Anti-Phishing Working Group's (APWG) eCrime 2015https://apwg.org/apwg-events/ecrime2015/ event on Tuesday were warned by a panel of cryptocurrency experts that research in the sector is lagging behind criminal practice.Speaking inside the CaixaForumhttp://obrasocial.lacaixa.es/nuestroscentros/english/caixaforumbarcelona_en.html, APWG chairman Dave Jevans, who has been following bitcoin since 2011, told the audience that this knowledge gap presented a challenge for everyone in the room, noting:  ""[Cryptocurrencies] have their own world of crime and fraud that we need to explore and understand in the coming years. They also are deeply integrated in the fraud that we deal with today: phishing, ransomware and money laundering.""  Founded in 2003, the APWG is a 2,000-strong member organisation that aims to tackle security threats in the digital age by pooling resources and brainpower across the public and private sectors.  The four-day symposium, billed as the destination ""where cybercrime fighters meet and collaborate"", included cryptocurrencies on the agenda for the first time in the group's 12-year history.  Gaining momentum  Speaking to CoinDesk, APWG secretary general Peter Cassidy said it had taken a while for digital currencies to gain enough momentum to be taken seriously by the organisation.  Support from merchants like Dell and TigerDirect, he said, played a part in changing this, explaining:  ""Like cheques, drafts and wires, [bitcoin] is now part of the panoply of payment mechanisms, part of normal commerce. We have a responsibility to follow normal commerce and its abuse. Our role as stakeholders is to manage that abuse – we owe it to that community.""  ""We have to learn to understand how the bad guys are using it to instrument new forms of crime, or old forms of crime with a new [twist],"" he added.  The topic of how to go about out-innovating criminal activity featured throughout the day's cryptocurrency sessions.  The subject first appeared during a short primer on the history of bitcoin led by Jevans and later on a Q&A panel with four experts in the field: AIT data scientist Bernhard Haslhofer; Maurits Lucas, head of cyber intelligence at Fox inTELL; PayPal analyst Brad Wardman and Gem CEO Ken Miller.  Deanonymisation  Haslhofer, who presented findings from the Bitcrime project, suggested that there were several methods available to ""deanonymise"" users of bitcoin, a subject that has been hotly debated by the cryptocurrency's community.  However, despite some successes in areas like transaction clustering, one privacy tool that has withstood researchers' scrutiny has been the bitcoin 'mixing' model.  With no real way to trace relationships between the senders and receivers using these services, Haslhofer proposed that crimefighters could choose to 'blacklist' criminal transactions instead.  ""If you taint the output of mixers and demotivate them to use them for a transaction they are of less value.""  Other panelists argued that coordinating and maintaining such lists across exchanges, wallets and law enforcement agencies could prove difficult. Miller went on to suggest that media and consumer awareness could be enough to pressure stakeholders into such an agreement.  Criminal behaviour  Maurits Lucas, head of cyber intelligence at Fox inTELL, presented a skeptical counterpoint to others on the panel, terming the cryptocurrency sector a ""Wild West"".  ""A lot of the issues that we’re facing here with cryptocurrencies today are the exact reasons why we thought up the institution of a bank in the first place,"" he said, adding that the technology is a solution in search of a problem.  Criminals, too, have found the currency problematic, he said. Its volatility means most are eager to cash out and run as soon as possible.  A DDoS researcher in the audience also regaled how bitcoin was a poor currency for other digital criminals, explaining:  ""Having spoke to the people running DDoS sites, the fact that they can keep getting paid in bitcoin is of no interest to them because people who buy services off them want to pay in PayPal.”  Jevans was more enthusiastic about the potential benefits of a technology like bitcoin. The Marble Security CEO revealed he had got into the currency early, buying in at $6 a coin.  He later shared images of the goo-cooled custom mining rig he constructed with a friend.  Hardware debate  Following Gem's January announcement that it had implemented a custom Hardware Security Module (HSM) to protect its private keys, Miller stressed that bitcoin could learn a lot from the way the banking industry uses the technology, which ""has been done for years.""  The CEO was less bullish on consumer hardware, USB wallets like Trezor and Ledger, which he said were not the answer to ""mass scale adoption"".  ""My personal opinion is that a software wallet will win the day because I think if you're not a hardcore bitcoin enthusiast you don't want to carry something like that around with you. It's a small market,"" he remarked.  Wardman, who talked about account validation at PayPal earlier in the day, agreed that overcomplicating tech could be a barrier for some users – despite the benefits, adding:  ""I’m a big fan of two-factor authentication but I guess one concern I have is how the older generation who already struggle with current tech will cope.""  Long-term challenges  A show of hands in the room indicated that around 10% of attendees owned bitcoin. However, with one in every tenth coin stolen, audience members questioned how the cryptocurrency could cross into the rest of the room, let alone reach widespread mainstream use.  Consumer adoption aside, due to the sophistication and skill of bitcoin attacks, Cassidy warned that cryptocurrencies would be something the group could not afford to ignore. The topic would now be a fixture on future APWG events, he added.  ""It’s a scary moment to imagine the level of skill and sophistication of an attacker who wants to game bitcoin. It’s a different kind of attacker. It’s a new frontier.""  Miller said it was obvious that bad actors would feature in some of bitcoin's 20 million wallets, emphasising that criminals have historically been ""the early adopters of things"".  However, he added, this shouldn't deter those exploring bitcoin's legitimate uses, concluding:  ""In the early days of the Internet, it was only for gamblers, illicit activity and drug dealers and pornography, fortunately we didn’t all subscribe to that and it’s changed all our lives.""

42426367,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxxh,1432833342,Pinn Wins Top Prize for Hands-Free Bitcoin Payments App,"Payments startup Pinn placed first in the retail category at Plug and Play demo day last week for a unique point-of-sale (POS) solution that enables bitcoin and fiat payments without the need for a smartphone or wallet.  The accelerator featured a number of bitcoin and blockchain startups in its FinTech portion, however, Pinn provided evidence of bitcoin's expanding appeal to other markets.  Pinn was the only retail startup to integrate bitcoin into its solution, but 18-year-old entrepreneur and CEO Will Summerlin sees the technology as one that could give it a long-term advantage over its competitors.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Essentially, bitcoin eliminates dealing with international transactions, because it's a global currency. In an international environment, bitcoin creates a more frictionless payment process, you don't have to deal with conversion.""  Pinn leverages proximity technologies, including Apple's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) point-of-sale technology, iBeacon, to reduce the payment process to one action. Customers who have the app pay for items by entering a four-digit code on one of Pinn's merchant Android POS tablets.  ""There's a long process that goes on there that ensures that the customer's device is actually in the store,"" Summerlin said. ""It's impossible to spoof the way we're doing it, but we have to ensure that it is the actual customer that has this phone in their pocket.""  Summerlin indicated that Pinn is currently working with Panasonic to bring its technology to the 2020 Olympic Games to be held in Tokyo, but that such talks are in ""early stages"".  He went on to described how bitcoin payments could be ideal for this type of large scale event, where the volume of foreign exchange adds costs for athletes and their sponsors.  Panasonic did not respond to a request for comment at press time.  Bitcoin vs ACH  While Pinn allows users to link a traditional bank account or a bitcoin wallet, its design also arguably impacts the ability for bitcoin to compete at checkout, a fact acknowledged by Summerlin in interview.  For example, Pinn enables merchants to accept ACH transactions, or direct debit transfers from consumer bank accounts. This means US dollar payments on Pinn's network would cost just 1% for merchants to accept, the same rate bitcoin payment processors such as BitPay and Coinbase charge to convert BTC funds to fiat after a free trial period.  However, Summerlin sees bitcoin as having other advantages besides its low cost for users, most notably in the demographic it reaches and the way it can complement a payments solution by strengthening its international appeal.  ""I think there are advantages not related to the actual transaction where bitcoin is more valuable,"" he continued. ""If you have some sort of online service, and you accept bitcoin, instead of converting that bitcoin to currency, you can simply use it in a brick-and-mortar environment.""  Summerlin said he believes that merchants are most interested in accepting bitcoin online, but that Pinn can serve as a way to bolster the number of physical retailers on the network.  He expects the number of online professionals that accept bitcoin to increase, and that Pinn could create an incentive for these individuals to hold bitcoin until these funds could be spent.  Early bitcoin activities  Like many young people interested in payments, Summerlin admitted to dabbling in bitcoin, even mining and purchasing the digital currency prior to Pinn. However, he suggested that he felt the payments experience required more than just bitcoin to be disrupted successfully.  He noted how he was first convinced that QR codes could transform the checkout experience but soon moved on to the next iteration of his idea.  ""I realized it was not disruptive enough,"" he said. ""To disrupt payments you have to have something really disruptive, something that's best for all parties involved. We literally vetted hundred of concepts and this is the culmination of the best attributes of all those combined.""  In this light, Summerlin sees Pinn as a startup willing to take the best ideas from a longer list of early-stage payment technologies, utilizing each one, including bitcoin, for its advantages.  ""We wanted to get in early,"" Summerlin concluded. ""The other part of it is, bitcoin is cool.""
