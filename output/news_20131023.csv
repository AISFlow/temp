42397271,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoC7k,1382556136,All you need to know about federal bitcoin law in Canada,"My name is Matt Burgoyne and I'm an associate at Canadian legal firm McLeod Law. I'm involved with Canadian and international counsel in the developing area of virtual currency law, specifically including bitcoin currency. In this two-part series, I will give a basic primer on the state of Canadian law as it applies to digital currency entrepreneurs.  Unlike its elephant neighbour to the south, Canada’s federal and provincial governments and their regulators have been relatively quiet when it comes to the issue of bitcoin and exactly how it should be defined and governed. Despite the lack of a formal position on bitcoin, we as lawyers can make educated guesses on the federal and provincial legislation that might apply to businesses operating in the bitcoin space in Canada.  In this first article of a two-part series, we will cover the Canadian federal law as it currently applies (or more accurately doesn’t apply) to Canadian businesses operating in the bitcoin space. In Part II, we will cover provincial regulations pertaining to, or which could pertain to, bitcoin businesses. In Canada, it’s safe to say the bulk of the action lies within the domain of our federal legislation, compared with the situation in the US where, as Marco Santori phrased it, “the state level is really where the action is”.  Will the Canada Revenue Agency want a piece of the action?  The Canada Revenue Agency (the CRA) is our federal taxman equivalent to the IRS is the US and the HMRC in the UK. It’s governed by federal legislation called the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the Tax Act).  To the best of my knowledge, aside from a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) news article posted on CBC’s website in late April, where a representative of the CRA confirmed that taxes on bitcoin could indeed apply to certain transactions pursuant to the Tax Act, no branch of the Canadian government has issued an official notice or any form of written guidance on the state of the law of bitcoin.  The scant information provided by the CRA referred to in the CBC news article confirmed that two separate tax rules apply to bitcoin, depending on whether bitcoins are being used as money to buy things or if they are merely bought and sold for speculative purposes.  According to CRA spokesman Philippe Brideau, barter transaction rules would apply between arms-length parties, such that where a purchaser has received value in a bitcoin transaction (and that value is received in fiat currency or bitcoin), that value must be documented as a taxable gain of at least the amount of the value of the good being exchanged or sold.  He went on to state:  “When bitcoins are bought and sold like a commodity, any resulting gains or losses could be income or capital for the taxpayer depending on the specific facts.”  In the CBC news article, Brideau made reference to the archaic CRA Interpretation Bulletin IT-490, which is dated 5th July, 1982. It refers to “sophisticated computer-controlled systems of commerce proliferated by franchised, member only barter clubs, where credit units possessing a notional monetary unit value have become a medium of exchange” and how barter rules apply to those exchanges.  To my knowledge there has been no further written guidance from the CRA other than the above statements made in the CBC news article and the now ancient Interpretation Bulletin. No CRA ruling has been publicly released to the media in Canada or published on the CRA’s website specifically relating to bitcoin.  What should businesses be most concerned with?  Despite regulation derived from the Tax Act that would govern how bitcoins are taxed in Canada, I believe the federal Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the PCTFA) would be the major starting point and piece of federal legislation that could impact a bitcoin brokerage, exchange, bricks and mortar or online vendor accepting payment in bitcoin. It could also affect any organization in the business of selling a bitcoin-related product, such as pre-paid gift cards that are instantly redeemable in bitcoin.  Another piece of federal legislation that could apply in Canada to bitcoin businesses is the Criminal Code of Canada (the Criminal Code), which is within the domain of the federal government and is not regulated by individual provinces/states as is the case in the US.  Here is how the Canadian Criminal Code might apply to bitcoin businesses operating in Canada: unsurprisingly, the Criminal Code confirms that it is illegal to launder proceeds of crime and every business will have committed an offence if it uses or transfers any property or any proceeds of any property with intent to conceal or convert that property or those proceeds, knowing or believing that the property and its proceeds were obtained or derived directly or indirectly via illegal sources.  In Canada, pursuant to our constitution, currency and coinage, legal tender and other financial activities, such as banking, fall under the exclusive domain of the federal government. The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) is the police force behind the PCTFA (similar to FINCEN in the US).  Risk analysis for bitcoin businesses at the federal level  As of the date of this article, all FINTRAC has really done is send emails to certain bitcoin businesses informing them that they are not subject to FINTRAC regulation. In an email to one Canadian bitcoin brokerage, a senior compliance officer on behalf of FINTRAC declared that, with respect to the business activities of the brokerage (which are relegated to the buying and selling of bitcoins via fiat currency):  “Although your entity remits and/or transmits funds when you buy and sell bitcoins, it is simply a corollary of your actual business of buying and selling virtual currency. Therefore, you do not have to register your entity with us. Should your business model change in the future to expand beyond buying and selling bitcoins, we appreciate you contacting us in order for us to review and reassess our interpretation to reflect these new facts.""  In a separate case, a client of mine, CoinTap did essentially the same thing as the brokerage mentioned above and exercised some due diligence. The company, which produces and distributes pre-paid bitcoin gift cards that can be purchased at retail or online vendors and redeemed instantly for bitcoins, contacted FINTRAC in order to get an answer to the question of whether its business model would be considered a ‘money service business’ (MSB) that would trigger some rather onerous licensing requirements.  [post-quote]  CoinTap was contacted by a representative of FINTRAC who requested that CoinTap send FINTRAC an email with its business model, how it was receiving money and its cash limits for selling the pre-paid bitcoin gift cards. The FINTRAC representative indicated that they would take a close look at that data and let CoinTap know if they need to apply to be an MSB. Fingers crossed, as of the date of this publication no reply has been received, but CoinTap is obviously hoping for a response similar to what was provided to the brokerage mentioned earlier.  The risk here is that, pursuant to section 73 of the PCTFA, the governor in council has the power to make regulations prescribing additional entities as falling under the jurisdiction of the PCTFA. If history is any indication, it is only a matter of time before Canada follows the example set by the United States government in terms of regulation of bitcoin and its users.  My prediction is that such regulation, as a starting point at least, could come through thePCTFA and will definitely apply to bitcoin brokerages and exchanges, but it is possible that those regulations may apply to bitcoin companies which offer other services than just currency exchanges or brokerage services.  Who has to comply?  Under the PCTFA, a business that falls under the jurisdiction of FINTRAC and its associated regulations includes “persons or entities engaged in the business of foreign exchange dealing, of remitting funds or transmitting funds by any means or through any person, entity or electronic funds transfer network, or of issuing or redeeming money orders, traveler’s cheques or other similar negotiable instruments except for cheques payable to a named person or entity”.  The regulations associated with the PCTFA indicate that the above entities are referred to as MSB’s. That means, for example, that a Canadian bitcoin exchange would have to put into effect some form of compliance regime with the following minimum requirements (this is not a comprehensive list by any means, but flags some important features):  Name a compliance officer: someone who will have enough authority and autonomy in the organization to be able to put into effect the compliance regime.  Write a very comprehensive (and legally expensive) compliance policies and procedures manual detailing how you will meet all of your registration, reporting, record keeping, client identification, and risk management obligations. This is similar to the anti-money laundering requirements in the United States. The manual has to be reviewed by FINTRAC every two years.  Identify Clients: Similar to the FINCEN requirements, clients have to be identified and meticulous records must be kept in various situations.  Large cash transaction and electronic fund transfer report: A report has to be sent to FINTRAC within 15 days after an MSB receives $10,000 or more in cash or electronic funds in one transaction from one client or two or more cash or electronic transactions within 24 hours that total $10,000.  Some final thoughts  The question of whether any Canadian bitcoin business (bricks and mortar coffee shops accepting bitcoins as payment for an Americano, Canadian online retailers accepting bitcoin as payment for funky t-shirts, etc.) that are not bitcoin brokerages or exchanges in Canada would be deemed to be MSB’s by FINTRAC will depend on various factors. In my opinion, FINTRAC is going to widen the net in terms of what type of bitcoin businesses will need to be licensed as MSB’s, probably because of pressure from international governments and other outside interests.  For the bitoin businesses currently operating in Canada, it is useful to note that I received a copy of an email from a FINTRAC representative on the issue of grace periods if and when FINTRAC decides to formally bring the hammer down, here is an excerpt:  “… in the event of future regulatory changes, FINTRAC would produce guidance to help interpret any amendments and this guidance would be published in advance of a coming into force date.”  So, according to this correspondence at least, FINTRAC would give bitcoin businesses a ‘heads up’, if you will, prior to implementing any of its cumbersome legislation. In my opinion, any kind of retroactive penalties which may be imposed by FINTRAC are unlikely, given bitcoin’s anonymous nature, but one can never be sure.  To summarize, the current state of the federal law in Canada is that bitcoins, the brokerages that are used to convert bitcoins into fiat currencies, bitcoin exchanges and online and storefront vendors are currently not subject to regulation.  It could be a fair statement to say that virtual currencies in Canada are very much operating in a “wild west” type of environment, with the caveat that FINTRAC is likely monitoring the current legal environment and rest assured, bitcoin companies (any business operating in the bitcoin virtual currency space) will be regulated in Canada at the federal level at some point in the future.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Matthew Burgoyne,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/23/all-you-need-to-know-about-federal-bitcoin-law-in-canada,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49eac47236917efbbe7c5b54d6a0b5233c9c2d07-1025x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397275,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCCf,1382541180,Bitmarkers wants to move money in bitcoin for in-casino gambling,"At first blush, bitcoin and gambling seem like a pretty comfortable pair and it seems to be flourishing. The concept of bitcoin and in-casino gambling may be a bit further off right now for the mainstream, but it’s coming.  And Ardon Lukasiewicz, brother of Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz, is all-in on bitcoin and brick-and-mortar casinos. “I'd like to pursue Las Vegas as the bitcoin mega-destination,” he says.  Lukasiewicz is the CEO of Bitmarkers, a company that plans to offer frictionless movement for gambling money via the use of bitcoin. Unlike the relatively unregulated online gambling space, real-world casinos are often faced with powerful oversight by regulatory commissions.  And these governing bodies continue to attempt to crack down on money laundering and tax evasion that is conducted through casinos. Someone can conceivably take illegitimate cash money to a casino, circulate it and then walk away with cleansed money.  [post-quote]  Casino operators are making it abundantly clear that they don’t want this type of activity occurring on their floors. Earlier this year, it was reported that the Las Vegas Sands Corporation started placing limits on international wire transfers and bank transfers that use aliases.  “There are more international funds moving around and more stress about where the money comes from and where it’s going,” Sands president Michael Leven said back in January.  Lukasiewicz says that he has a number of gamblers already interested in his company’s services, which also provides casino hotel bookings with bitcoin.  “We currently have hundreds of thousands in disclosed gaming interest by our beta member signups. This is with zero marketing,” he told CoinDesk.  Online gambling and doing so in person at a real casino are two very different experiences. Bitmarkers aims to focus on the market segment that requires more personal attention.  “We welcome all players and have more personal relationship with customers than may be normal with online gaming. It isn't a high volume ‘grind’ such as other bitcoin gaming options,” Lukasiewicz said.  Bitcoin-denominated online gaming has produced a number of gambling startups. SatoshiDice, one of the bitcoin economy’s largest, was sold a few months back for the equivalent of $11.5 million in bitcoins at the time.  Many have concluded that it is online gambling that produces the largest number of transactions on the Bitcoin network, helping it to grow overall. And though online black marketplace spending likely is a significant contributor as well, the closure of Silk Road and subsequent arrests of users by law enforcement has probably diminished that particular facet of bitcoin-based spending activity.  Bitmarkers could help accelerate the pace of adoption for bitcoin with its system, which Lukasiewicz says he has been working 100-hour weeks to create.  “We are building the platform to be easier, cheaper, and more private than a regular player's current options while also simplifying things to be more welcoming to newcomers,” he said.  What do you think about moving money in bitcoin for real casino gambling? Does Bitmarkers have a tremendous opportunity in the casino gaming market? Let us know in the comments.

42397283,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCLW,1382532606,Scrypt-based miners and the new cryptocurrency arms race,"Manufacturers are planning to ship scrypt-based equipment that will speed up mining and reduce the power overhead for the alternative cryptocurrency algorithm. Could this fuel the next cryptocurrency arms race?  Most cryptocurrencies that are mined by computers use a ‘proof of work’ algorithm, designed to make them prove that they have invested the computing power in producing the coins. Bitcoin uses SHA–256, but many alternative coins (altcoins) use another system, called scrypt.  One of the biggest differences between scrypt and SHA-256 is that the former relies heavily on computing resources aside from the processing unit itself, particularly memory. Conversely, SHA-256 doesn’t. This makes it difficult for scrypt-based systems to scale up and use lots of computing power, because they would have to use a proportional amount of memory, and that is expensive.  “It makes it difficult to run many instances of scrypt in parallel in a graphics card, for example,” said Charles Lee, the inventor of litecoin, adding:  “This also means that the manufacturing cost of scrypt ASICs will be significantly more expensive than that of SHA-256 ASICs.”  Nevertheless, some companies are beginning to tout hardware dedicated to mining scrypt-based coins such as Lee’s. One is Crypto Industries, based in London, UK. It will shortly launch pre-orders for three different boxes: the Isis, a 1MH/sec unit, the 5MH/sec Osiris, and the 10MH/sec Horus.  Mike Kular, co-founder of the company, worked as a marketing manager before leaving his job to trade coins full-time. He was mining SHA-256 and scrypt-based coins with a 20-GPU setup, but it was costing him £600 per month, he said.  “What’s important is the efficiency of the power you’re giving the machine,” Kular said. “You’re getting 2-300% more power efficiency using our machines.”  Crypto Industries’ mining units are based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips, from Xilinx, and will deliver worst-case power consumption of 150w, 750w, and 1.5kw respectively, according to company spec sheets.  Memory  However, given scrypt’s requirements, power isn’t the only crucial parameter. Memory is also important. The memory bandwidth is a function of how many input/output (IO) pins exist on the chips, says Kular. In FGPAs, as in ASICs, the process node (the size of the transistors, which governs how many logic gates will fit on a piece of silicon) are still, important, but they aren’t as important as with bitcoin. “The gates aren’t the commanding factor. It’s about the I/O pins” said Kular, adding that the FGPA boards will have a memory bandwidth of 24.8GB/sec per board.  Crypto Industries’ systems will have multiple boards, controlled by a Raspberry Pi. This will run a modified version of the CGMiner open source mining software, modified to work with scrypt mining software on FPGAs. Users will be able to access it via a browser, or upload their configurations via a preformatted text document on a USB stick.  The firm will be releasing support for various scrypt-based coins via firmware updates over time, but it will start with the ability to switch between Litecoin and Feathercoin, but hopes to have 30-40 different currencies within a month of its first shipment, and it says that it's very close to taking preorders.  There are other companies planning to offer dedicated scrypt-based mining hardware. ASICs may be difficult to implement for scrypt, but they’re not impossible. Lee said:  “ASIC doesn't necessarily make mining unaffordable. It's actually the opposite. ASIC makes it such that anyone can purchase mining hardware and run it.”  “The problem is the big players can afford to purchase million dollars worth of mining equipment cheaper than the little players. So that might squeeze the little players since bitcoin/litecoin mining is basically an arms race,” he added.  There are also some ASIC miners in the works. scrypt Asic International (SAI), which listed on CryptoStocks last week, retooled its first design before it even shipped, moving beyond what it called “GPU conversion technology” to what it says is an ASIC design. It will offer its original Unit 1 machines, as ‘minis’, at 2.5MH/sec, according to its posts on the Cryptostocks site, for £800. The new unit 1 units should offer 5MH/sec for £1,500, according to its website.  Then there’s Alpha Technologies, which didn’t answer mails from CoinDesk, but which has moved from the idea of putting GPU chips in a box to an FGPA (although its website also calls it an ASIC). It is citing 5MH/sec at 200 watts.  None of these companies have shipped, however, and in spite of their online pledges of reliability, they don’t have a track record. But KnCMiner does. The company, which is already shipping its bitcoin ASIC miners, has plans for a scrypt-based mining product. But little is known about it yet. “We can’t make many of those details public yet as we have not finished the design,” co-founder Sam Cole told CoinDesk.  Any takers?  The question is, who will buy these miners? Are these altcoins, (with litecoin being the most strongly established), going to be popular enough to entice people to invest in more mining hardware?  “The growth of litecoin will follow that of bitcoin. There's a few steps along the way until major merchants will start supporting litecoin,” said Lee, adding that it will take a payment processor to support litecoin. “But before they would do that, they need a way to exchange litecoins for various currencies. So that means there needs to be support from major exchanges to provide liquidity.”  He hopes that Mt. Gox will fulfill on its vow to introduce litecoin support, and is also hoping for similar moves from Bitstamp and BTC China. “So very soon, litecoin will take the first major step towards merchant support.”  Scrypt-based miners may be a relatively new thing, but getting in early and taking a gamble could pay off, if litecoin gains a solid merchant and payment infrastructure, and starts to take off. Right now, the litecoin hash rate is around 25GH/sec, meaning that you’d have to buy 25 of Crypto Industries’ big Horus boxes (and pay for 37.5Kw) to get 1% of the network power.  Litecoin isn’t the only scrypt-based coin out there, but is the most established. If litecoins were selling at a premium, buying a miner might be an easier immediate proposition for customers. However, that currency has dropped steadily in price against BTC since early July, and hasn't done very well against the dollar either.  However, those that do buy now may be hoping that they're ready to mine when the price bounces back. And in the meantime, they'll have the option to flip between litecoin and other scrypt-based coins. When pre-orders open for these systems, it will be interesting to monitor demand.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | LTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/23/scrypt-based-miners-and-the-new-cryptocurrency-arms-race,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b23c74a5126343b3d71d2f12a653a988e25a3e4-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397281,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCJY,1382523318,SoftTouch POS helps restaurants turn bitcoins into dollars,"Restaurant electronic solutions maker SoftTouch POS is integrating bitcoin into its flagship point-of-sale payment system, to capitalize on ""the explosion in popularity of bitcoin"" in 2013.  Bitcoin brings significant benefits to the hospitality industry, the company said. While the concept of a secure electronic currency with lower transaction fees and no chargebacks has been praised by business owners of all kinds, SoftTouch POS also cited worldwide adoption of bitcoin and its usefulness to travelers in particular as reasons for the decision.  ""We've always been aggressive when it comes to innovation,"" said SoftTouch POS's president Michael Paycher. ""We are early adopters of bitcoin and it's important for us to be the first fully integrated POS solution for restaurants nationwide, ie: bragging rights!""  [post-quote]  ""Since bitcoin hasn't penetrated the mainstream quite yet, we haven't received many requests for its integration, however our approach has never been to wait and see. We believe bitcoin popularity is inevitable,"" he added.  The company uses BitPay as its payment processing gateway.  Paycher says the SoftTouch POS system is suitable for restaurants of any size, from a small coffee shop to an upscale eatery or chain of outlets. The time required to get things running can vary based on the size of the business, though for smaller stores it can be implemented in as little as one week.  ""Our software products are sold through a value added reseller network, so the cost of each implementation can vary too. Our prices tend to be amongst the lowest in the industry while offering comprehensive functionality,"" Paycher said.  The Florida-based company has been developing electronic solutions for the hospitality industry since 1994, and their product line includes devices and software for every imaginable restaurant function, from visual table layout and booking systems to staff time management recorders. A restaurant's SoftTouch POS menu configuration can integrate with a website, allowing customers to place orders online.  In-restaurant bitcoin use  On the ground, early-adopting eateries who accept bitcoin can have the same kind of mixed feelings towards digital currency as its other users in the 'physical' world. While sidestepping bank transaction and credit card merchant fees is appealing, there is always the need to turn bitcoin into fiat currency in a 'real' bank account, at least until bitcoin acceptance extends to suppliers and landlords as well.  Traci Consoli owns The Pink Cow in Tokyo's Roppongi entertainment district, an institution among expats and locals in the entrepreneurial innovation community. To date, it is the only restaurant in the metropolitan area of 35+ million people known to accept bitcoin and functions hopefully as a working example to other Japanese businesses of what bitcoin could do for them.  ""In the restaurant business the average profit margin is only 10%,"" she said. ""Banks charge 5% just to process the payments, so it's effectively 50% of our profits gone to banks for pushing a button.""  Being the only bitcoin-accepting business in town can still be tough at times though.  ""We're all about new and innovative things at the Pink Cow, but it doesn't always pay to be an innovator. Sometimes, if you believe in something, you just have to do it. Someone's got to,"" she explained, adding:  ""At this point it needs constant tech support. If I didn't have good friends familiar with it to help maintain it, it might be too cumbersome to use. At this point, BitPay doesn't have a Japanese bank exchange so we have to go through Mt. Gox to get paid in yen, which takes a couple of weeks.""  Watching The Pink Cow's Android tablet and QR code system in action showed it worked reasonably well; quicker than a credit card but not as smoothly as the myriad RFID card e-cash systems popular in Tokyo like Suica, Waon and Rakuten Edy. The Pink Cow's clientele, however, tended towards bitcoin friendly or curious and were happy to wait a few extra seconds to try something new.  At this point, SoftTouch POS sells to the US and Canadian markets where BitPay is more established. While the integrated approach makes bitcoin payment processing speed seamless (usually just a few seconds) exchanging that amount to fiat is entirely in BitPay's hands and SoftTouch POS isn't able to make guarantees. Michael Paycher added that, for North American clients at least, BitPay usually does once-a-day direct deposits into merchants' bank accounts.
