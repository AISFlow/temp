42415272,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRlTI,1654817296,First Mover Asia: Ethereum’s Ropsten ‘Merge’ Prompts Mixed Analyst Sentiment; Bitcoin Is Flat,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin remains range-bound; some altcoins outperform.  Insights: Analysts' opinions differ on the Ethereum Ropsten Merge.  Technician's take (Editor's Note): Technician's Take is on hiatus today.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $29,999 -0.9%  Ether (ETH): $1,782 -0.8%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Chainlink LINK +3.3% Computing Polygon MATIC +2.7% Smart Contract Platform Polkadot DOT +1.3% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Algorand ALGO −4.6% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP −4.2% Computing Litecoin LTC −3.2% Currency  Bitcoin Holds Steady; Some Altcoins Do Better  Thursday was another ""Groundhog Day"" for bitcoin.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose a little, dropped some but always remained firmly entrenched around the $30,000 threshold where it's been camped for much of the past five weeks as investors awaited the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Friday.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $30,000, roughly flat for the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands just below the $1,800 level, about where it was perched a day ago and for the past few weeks. Other major altcoins were mixed, with LTC off more than 3% at one point and ADA and CRO down about a percentage point. Among the winners, LINK continued its recent surge, rising over 6% at one point, while SOL was up more than 3%.  ""Bitcoin continues to hover around the $30,000 level as crypto traders await a key inflation report that could sway market expectations as to what the Fed may do in September,"" Oanda Senior Analyst Americas Edward Moya wrote in an email.  The European Central Bank's (ECB) announcement that it would begin raising interest rates next month sent first major European and then U.S. indexes falling with the latter taking a last-hour dive to post their biggest decline since mid May. Technology companies suffered among the roughest batterings, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 2.7% and the tech component of the S&P 500 off about the same. The ECB announced it would hike rates a quarter of a point in July to combat inflation and that it would raise rates additionally later in the year.  The U.S. CPI is widely expected to show inflation still percolating well above 8%, its highest level in four decades. The U.S. Central Bank will likely raise interest rates another half-percentage point at its next meeting to match its most recent rate hike last month. Meanwhile energy prices continued to hover around 2022 highs with Brent crude oil, a benchmark of global energy markets, closing at about $123 per barrel, a roughly 60% increase from the start of the year.  ""Inflation is hot and it will remain hot and rate hike expectations should continue to climb after each monthly inflation report,"" Moya wrote.  Cryptos suffered their own latest, mini-outbreak of bad news with separate reports that South Korean authorities are investigating TerraForm Labs for the collapse of its terraUSD stablecoin (UST), and that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was probing whether the Singapore-registered firm had violated U.S. laws in its marketing of UST and the LUNA token that supported it.  ""This has been a messy several weeks for crypto filled with lawsuits, scams, and fading interest as prices have remained anchored,"" Moya wrote. ""Crypto needs a few fresh catalysts to break out of these doldrums and that could take a while.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,017 -2.3%  DJIA: 32,272 -1.9%  Nasdaq: 11,754 -2.7%  Gold: $1,847 -0.2%  Insights  Analyst Opinion Differs on the Ethereum Ropsten Merge  Ethereum’s Ropsten public testnet underwent a “Merge” on Wednesday ahead of an eventual rollout on the main network. The move comes ahead of a much-awaited shift from the current proof-of-work (PoW) network to a proof-of-stake (PoS) design.  PoW refers to a validation model that relies on entities called miners that use computing resources to validate transactions and support a blockchain network. PoS, on the other hand, relies on network ""validators"" who lock up relevant tokens on nodes to process transactions and support the network.  PoS systems are considered more environmentally friendly than PoW and help create a cheaper and faster blockchain. A move to PoS would alleviate recurrent criticisms of Ethereum’s network, such as the network’s fees. Fees, for example, crossed over $12,000 worth of ether (ETH) per transaction earlier this year when non-fungible tokens (NFT) related to the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem were offered to the public.  Switching the blockchain from one consensus mechanism to another is a complex change, which requires multiple tests on testnets like Ropsten before they are finally deployed on the mainnet.  Currently, the Beacon Chain is the PoS coordination chain that already has validators creating and validating new blocks in tandem with the main PoW execution chain. Once the PoS chain has been adequately tested and secured, the two chains will merge and Ethereum will continue as a PoS blockchain.  A shift to PoS will cause a shift in ether’s market dynamics. Supply would likely decline as fewer coins would likely be issued, while expected yields of over 7% to stakers would increase demand for ether.  Such forecasts have led to positive sentiment among investors, with some, like prominent billionaire technology investor Mark Cuban, stating they are “very bullish” on the asset’s future.  Market observers and developers within the crypto space remain mixed in reaction, however.  Brad Yasar, the founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) platform EQIFI, said in an email that while a shift to PoS comes with benefits, Ethereum’s PoW model was its main feature thus far.  “As much as a transition from POW to POS is seen as the next step in Ethereum's future and is expected to solve several main challenges the blockchain is facing, it is important to note that PoW was Ethereum's DNA,” Yasar said. “Newer blockchains that copied Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and changed the validation mechanism or block structures or fees have launched since then, yet none has been able to take over Ethereum.”  Yasar stated ether’s recent price drop was partly due to “the uncertainty among the community that has been supporting Ethereum by mining on it.”  “Miners are an important segment of any PoW blockchain community that Ethereum will alienate once it is goes PoS. The long-term impact of this change can be a significant one as many supporters of Ethereum are going to leave [the blockchain] for other opportunities,” Yasar explained.  “All the benefits of lower carbon footprint, lower fees, etc., may not be enough to keep Ethereum relevant in a post-PoW world,” he added.  Others, however, remain upbeat about the Merge’s prospects, especially considering the significantly lessening of the environmental impact.  “We should not underestimate how important Ethereum’s switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake will be,” said Choise.com director of strategy Austin Kimm in a Telegram message. “This is just a test, but it at least means that Ethereum is on track to do what it promised.”  “Billions of complicated processing calculations will no longer be required and it is expected that this will reduce the energy consumption to negligible levels. Multiply this across literally thousands of tokens created on Ethereum and this should be a major milestone in global crypto adoption,” Kimm said, adding his firm remains “very bullish about the future of Ethereum.”  Estimates for a full rollout to PoS on the mainnet are in the final quarter of this year. A few features, such as the ability to withdraw staked ETH, however, will have to wait until after the Merge is complete, as previously reported.  Once Ethereum shifts from PoW to PoS, validators who have staked the required 32 ETH will take over the role of adding new blocks to the blockchain.

According to a June 8 announcement by NewsRadio 560 KPQ, the County PUD Commissioners approved the adjustment this week, which would result in a 29 percent rise in the electricity required for Bitcoin mining. Mining companies are transitioning from the high-density load rate schedule to the newly created cryptocurrency rate schedule, known as Rate 36. This groundbreaking move, according to Commissioner Garry Arseneault, will serve a blow to bitcoin miners as the increased electricity fees will result in a rise in rates too. Arseneault stated: &apos;What we did as a commission, and what we did as a utility was industry-leading, to create a new rate for this type of demand.&apos; Overall, Bitcoin mining operations consume far more electricity than other consumers, resulting in a greater transfer rate. Bitcoin Mining Electric Consumption Because Bitcoin mining consumes approximately a quarter of the available electricity from the county PUD, Douglas County has decided to prohibit any new Bitcoin mining businesses from establishing themselves in the county.

Marathon was originally informed by host Compute North that energization of its miners at its West Texas facility would begin in April. That was then delayed to May, and as of June 8, energization has yet to take place. At issue, Marathon said, is a tax matter for Compute North's energy supplier. Marathon expects the situation to be resolved in June.  CEO Fred Thiel said – in addition to its active fleet – new miner installation continues, with more than 19,00 rigs installed and awaiting energization.  Despite a recent industry trend of some miners selling some of their crypto holdings to help fund operating costs and/or expansion, Marathon continues to HODL, noting it hasn't sold any bitcoin since October 2020.

42395349,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvnqQ,1654806203,Market Wrap: Cryptos Rise With Altcoins in the Lead,"Bitcoin (BTC) was roughly flat on Thursday, confined to a tight trading range as traders await a decisive breakout or breakdown in prices. For now, sentiment among crypto traders is still bearish, albeit less so compared with last week, according to the bitcoin Fear & Greed index.  Meanwhile, most alternative cryptos (altcoins) outperformed bitcoin on Thursday, indicating a greater appetite for risk among short-term traders. Typically, alts rise more than BTC during up markets because of their greater risk profile. And the opposite is true during down markets.  Two standouts on Thursday were Chainlink's LINK token and Helium's HNT token, which both rallied by as much as 10% over the past 24 hours. And over the past week, Cardano's ADA token rose by 9%, compared with BTC's flat performance over the same period.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $30,038, −0.31%    ●Ether (ETH): $1,784, −0.18%    ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,019, −2.36%    ●Gold: $1,850 per troy ounce, −0.13%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.04%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Funding rates compressed  Bitcoin's funding rate, or the cost of funding long and short positions in the perpetual futures market, has been at or around neutral levels over the past six months. The previous record duration of a compressed funding environment lasted for four months from May to October last year.  ""This consistency of neutral to negative funding rates is unprecedented in the BTC [perpetual market] history,"" Arcane Research wrote in a report this week. That could be driven by the prolonged bearish sentiment among crypto traders, or the entrance of more funds taking advantage of the base neutral funding rate of 0.01% to earn a consistent yield, according to Arcane.  Typically, funding rates have seen sharp swings, which reflected extreme bullish/bearish sentiment around price highs and lows. Over time, however, traders have been less willing to pay for additional long or short exposure, possibly indicating a lower appetite for leverage or a neutral outlook among market participants.  Currently, funding rates are making minor lows, which could signal stabilization in prices after extreme sell-offs. For example, BTC's dip last weekend sent Bybit’s funding rate to the lowest level since February, similar to what occurred after BTC's sharp drop toward $25,300 on May 10.

The premier announced the creation of the association, called Next, at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022.  ""[Crypto companies] not seeking regulatory changes because we have regulatory clarity. It's more about how can they support the growth support the development, support educational initiatives” to improve the environment, Burt told CoinDesk before his speech.  The British Overseas Territory has sought to establish itself as a digital asset hub. From testing a digital dollar last year, to approving a license for its first digital asset bank, Jewel, on Tuesday, Bermuda is seemingly pressing forward with its plans to build a comprehensive crypto ecosystem.  Next is currently made up of 14 digital asset companies that have been licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA), including Apex Group, Bittrex, BlockFi, Circle and the newly licensed Jewel. According to an announcement shared with CoinDesk, the mission of the association is to help shape the British Overseas Territory’s digital asset legislation and support initiatives to enhance its digital asset ecosystem.  “Digital asset companies seek Bermuda's regulatory jurisdiction because of its proven track record where there is a single regulator that does not move the goal post on companies,” said Tim Reed, a member of Next’s co-founder committee, in an email to CoinDesk.  Next plans to help shape legislation around specific issues, such as taxes or stablecoins, on a case-by-case basis, Reed said. He added that Next has already completed its first session with the BMA and was allowed to provide real-time feedback before a policy on “Operational Cyber Risk Management and Custody Code of Practice” was finalized.  “The BMA was excited about the level of engagement and found the feedback helpful in viewing their policies through a collective business lens,” Reed said.

42395348,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvnoS,1654803060,Circle’s Disparte Calls CBDCs ‘a Preposterous Idea’ in Digital Dollar Debate,"AUSTIN, Texas — You know it’s going to be a fiery conversation when one of the panelists says “F**k the Fed” in his opening statement.  And no, it wasn’t a bitcoin bro saying it; it was Rohan Grey, a law professor at Willamette University and strident critic of the crypto industry, who shares its enmity for the legacy banking system but has very different ideas about how to replace it in the digital age.  Those differences were on full display in the panel discussion at Consensus 2022 on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve should issue a digital dollar or leave such innovation to the private sector. Dante Disparte, head of policy for stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial, called central bank digital currencies (CBDC) a “preposterous idea.” However, Grey warned private-sector efforts at creating a widely usable form of money would put the taxpayer on the hook if those efforts failed.  The Fed running its own digital currency is “the equivalent idea of the [Federal Aviation Administration] in the United States building jet engines and flying planes,” Disparte argued during a panel Wednesday at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 conference here, touting his company’s USDC stablecoin. “Circle’s not doing this as an academic abstraction. We’re doing it for real.”  But Gray countered that Circle is a private company that is shielded from liability. “If you go under, the public is on the hook for your losses,” he said.  Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard recently said her agency is waiting for support from Congress and the Biden administration before the Fed will decide whether to launch a digital dollar. If the central bank ends up issuing that digital currency, it could take at least five years to put it in place. Central bank digital currency holdings and transactions would still be managed through private-sector accounts, Brainard said, and not through direct customer accounts at the Fed.  Disparate contended that the U.S. is under pressure to “out-China China,” which has embraced the idea of a CBDC. It would be issued by “a government that can’t build health care websites that work,” he added.  ""This is not free market capitalism,” Grey said of private token efforts. “It's a new generation of crony capitalism.”  Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of crypto bank Custodia, made the point that the Fed has the last say in issuing dollars. She said she’s watching the decentralized financial (DeFi) space growing apart from the traditional U.S. financial system and there’s no way yet for money to move back and forth between them.  Long, whose Wyoming-based bank filed suit against the Fed this week for dragging its feet on the company’s application for a central bank “master account,” argued that the U.S. “should be embracing this new, better payment rail.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/09/circles-disparte-calls-cbdcs-a-preposterous-idea-in-digital-dollar-debate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc8f32140a2c8989fa4436904cfe90e1b76a238a-4608x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cifu said he doesn’t hold a view on the crypto sector apart from wanting to build a proper ecosystem for institutions and thinks there’s a lack of confidence in the incumbent companies.  Citadel Securities approached New York-based Virtu, a high-frequency trading and market-making firm, on creating a crypto marketplace, according to Cifu. He sees room to collaborate in creating a platform that can scale, and one in which institutions have trust and want to participate should interest in crypto grow.  “I don’t think that there’s a great deal of confidence” in a lot of the incumbents or newer players in the space, Cifu said. “Citadel is an amazing firm, and they’re a great partner.”  CoinDesk reported earlier this week that U.S. electronic trading giant Citadel Securities is working with Virtu to build a “cryptocurrency trading ecosystem,” with venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Paradigm also participating.

That process took a major step earlier this week with the introduction of sweeping legislation from U.S. Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)  A key aspect of that effort, Behnam said, is the power it gives the CFTC to assess fees on the industry, which would pay for new staff at the agency.  “It allows us to essentially do our job,” he said. “We have to evolve with markets. We have to evolve with technology.”  The recent meltdown of TerraUSD (UST) shows the need for regulation, Behnam said, noting the “terrific fall in price” of the algorithmic stablecoin.  “It validates what has been said, what I’ve said, for the past couple of years,” he said. “We need to put guardrails around the space.”",POSITIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | LUNA | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/09/cftc-chief-behnam-sees-a-crypto-movement-brewing-in-washington,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/faba3bbe03042fbe34da9a2b5da2f5de7d33a47d-4608x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Beginning June 22 and running until just after Labor Day, the program will be taught by Black Bitcoin Billionaire Founder Lamar Wilson and Najah J. Roberts, founder of the first African-American and woman-owned crypto exchange and education center in the U.S.  “Bitcoin is becoming a critical tool for many in Africa and Central and South America,” Jack Dorsey wrote on Twitter (TWTR). “We believe the same potential exists within communities in the U.S. Our goal is to prove that making powerful tools more available to people enables them to build greater independence.”  Dorsey also teased an expansion to the program, saying there’s “much more to come soon.”  An April report by Ariel Investments and Charles Schwab (SCHW) revealed that 25% of Black Americans own cryptocurrency, compared with just 15% of white Americans.  This isn’t Jay-Z and Dorsey’s first collaboration. In 2021, Dorsey’s Block (SQ) – then called Square – acquired Jay-Z’s music streaming service Tidal, which the two envisioned as a new platform for artists to create and be paid.

The round was led by 6th Man Ventures, the venture capital firm led by The Block founder Mike Dudas. Other participants in the round include B Capital, Worklife Ventures, Collab+Currency, Hannah Grey, Crypto.com, Exponent Capital and Eberg Capital, among others.  Launched in October 2021, Floor was co-founded by CEO Chris Maddern, who previously led the mobile business at Venmo and currently sits on the board of crypto publication The Block. He was later joined by Chief Technology Officer Siddhartha Dabral and Chief Operating Officer Christine Brown, who had left her previous post as Robinhood's (HOOD) Crypto COO to join the firm.  Floor offers NFT portfolio tracking, real-time price alerts, live activity for collections and multi-wallet support. Upcoming features include the ability to create an NFT watch list and estimated values to help guide buying and selling decisions.  “I'm a pretty savvy guy on crypto. I was trying to get into NF Ts, and it was still frankly incredibly hard,” Maddern told CoinDesk in an interview. “As you get further and further in, it becomes more punishing and confusing because you have to understand not just the value of your assets but then the other utility of your assets, what’s going on inside of each of those communities.”  Public app launch  Floor has operated as a token-gated experience where community members have to purchase an NFT to gain access to the app. The onboarding is a manual process that happens through Discord.  While that setup started to build the community and raised $2 million in funding, Floor needed to do more planning to make a public app that could be scalable for a larger audience while still maintaining benefits for token holders. Maddern expects the public app launch to happen in late summer or early fall.  Robinhood veteran Brown brings to the table her experience of scaling products with a growing community in mind. Last year, Robinhood was building out its wealth transfer products and the large size of the community left Brown with questions about how to engage such an audience early and in a safe way. She saw Maddern talking about similar issues on Twitter, reached out and came away from the initial conversation saying, “I need to work with this person.” The chats continued until Brown decided to leave Robinhood to help establish Floor.  “Traditional financial and spot crypto trading really serve one purpose, which is financial speculation. You put money in and hope that money is worth more when you pull it out,” Brown told CoinDesk. “Right now, one of the main use cases [of NFTs] is speculation and financial investment, but with everything from utility to access to memberships, I think this is going to be the space that eventually eclipses whatever else is going on.”  Community building  The funding will help Floor launch the public app, which removes the NFT purchase clause that could be a barrier to entry for some users. A larger user base can give Floor more leverage in forming partnerships with other firms in the NFT ecosystem and provide a deeper pool of feedback as to what NFT projects are generating the most excitement.  “We want to transition from a model where we have a very exclusive community to one where we can continue to build and foster that community,” Maddern said. “[Having] everyone be able to use the app means moving away from token sales as the primary model.”  Read more: 6th Man Ventures Raises $145M for Crypto Fund: Report",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/09/nft-app-floor-closes-8m-series-a-led-by-mike-dudas-vc-firm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd0e5bc6a6daeea951d6312812e4e0794e05c316-5765x3843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to an announcement post, the partnership includes a variety of integrations into UFC live events and original content for its digital and social media channels, starting Saturday, June 11.  Sports Business Journal sources said the deal was worth nearly $100 million across a minimum five-year deal period. CoinDesk reached out to VeChain for comment but hadn’t received a response by press time.  VeChain's VET token has moved modestly higher on the news, now up 2.4% per CoinDesk data.  The partnership marks the latest crypto-centric move for the UFC. In April, Crypto.com announced it would pay bitcoin (BTC) bonuses to UFC fighters.  Under the multi-year agreement, VeChain will have the rights for official UFC fighter rankings, providing visibility across live broadcasts and the UFC’s online presence. VeChain will also have a branded presence inside the UFC’s Octagon at 42 annual events and the 10-event Dana White Contender Series.  The two will collaborate on a range of original content featuring UFC talent and athletes, and an annual Brand Ambassador fund will offer paid marketing opportunities to UFC athletes.  VeChain is a blockchain platform specializing in real-word blockchain applications such as supply chain management and business processes. Previous partnerships have included Walmart, Bayer and BMW Group, among others.  “It is a historical moment when VeChain, the layer 1 public blockchain with the most enterprise adoption, joins forces with the fastest growing sport to raise awareness that blockchain technology is critical in helping deliver major global objectives, such as sustainability,” said VeChain co-founder and CEO Sunny Lu.

42395351,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvnrP,1654784388,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Defends $30K as ECB Preps First Rate Hike in More Than Decade,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.)  Price point: Bitcoin's price holds steady – defending $30K – as the European Central Bank moves to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade.  Market Moves: Mixed-up address snafu leads to $15M theft of Optimism's OP tokens, Sam Kessler reports.  Featured story: The Osmosis Chain will remain halted for at least 48 hours following a liquidity pool exploit that resulted in an estimated loss of $5 million, Oliver Knight reports.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was holding steady Thursday as the European Central Bank announced its first interest-rate hike in more than a decade.  As flagged in CoinDesk's Market Wrap newsletter on Wednesday, bitcoin's price this year has traded around expectations of central-bank monetary policy tightening – since the liquidity-sucking exercises also appear to influence cryptocurrencies.  For most of this year, the U.S. Federal Reserve's actions have attracted most of the focus. Now that the ECB is also moving to rein in soaring inflation, crypto traders are paying attention.  ""The globalization of markets means that this would affect all economies, so equities and crypto could suffer as a result in the short term,"" Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at UK-based digital-asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote Thursday in an email.  After a 3% drop on Wednesday, the bitcoin price was flat to slightly higher on Thursday at around $30,200.  For now, crypto bulls appear to have defended the crucial $30,000 price threshold. But some crypto analysts have warned that a deeper sell-off remains in the cards.  ""We still believe that the bear market for bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market has yet to play its final act, and that should be expected before the end of the year,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro.  For the past four weeks, bitcoin has traded in a tight range from roughly $32,300 to $28,000.  Such action resembles the U.S. stock market lately, where commentators have described the situation as ""boring.""  As more central banks follow the Fed's lead, markets might get more interesting again. Or maybe the central banks will simply suppress the volatility.  ICYMI: Please check out a smart piece by CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds in Thursday's First Mover Asia about major South Korean exchanges delisting litecoin (LTC).  Market moves  Wintermute concedes ""serious error"" leading to $15 million theft of Optimism's OP tokens  Ethereum scaling solution Optimism announced Wednesday that $15 million in OP governance tokens have been stolen by attackers, Sam Kessler reports.  Optimism intended to send the funds to a crypto-market maker, but they fell into the wrong hands when the market maker, Wintermute, provided Optimism’s team with an incorrect blockchain address.  In a statement, Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy took responsibility for allowing the theft: “We made a serious error.""  The attack followed a difficult couple of weeks for Optimism, whose botched OP token airdrop sent the token’s price tumbling in its first hours. The OP token fell an additional 20% on Wednesday's news, according to the most recent data from CoinMarketCap.  Link to full story: $15M of Optimism Tokens Stolen by an Attacker After Wintermute Sent Wrong Wallet Address  Feature: Osmosis to Cover Possible $5M Exploit Loss; Chain to Remain Halted for 2 Days  By Oliver Knight  The Osmosis Chain will remain halted for at least 48 hours following a liquidity pool exploit that resulted in an estimated loss of $5 million.  In a series of updates on Twitter (TWTR) and in a Discord post at 17:32 UTC on Wednesday, the Osmosis team said it will cover all losses using its strategic reserves.  The bug was an issue with the JoinPoolNoSwap function, in which liquidity providers received 50% more than they should have when withdrawing from liquidity pools.  The bug was exploited by a ""small number of individuals,"" Osmosis said. Four individuals have been identified as being responsible for 95% of the exploited amount.  ""Funds have been linked to CEX accounts,"" Osmosis community analyst RoboMcGobo wrote on Discord, referring to centralized crypto exchanges. ""Law enforcement has been notified. We're hopeful that the exploiters will do the right thing here so that aggressive action will not be necessary.""

The capital will be used to continue development on the game, which will be released on the Ethereum (ETC) and Solana blockchains, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk.  Other participants in the round included Binance Labs, Animoca Brands, Dialectic, and GuildFi, among others.  The Discord-playable game will be available on mobile and the web. Players can battle monsters, explore the virtual world and build communities. Upcoming features include main and side quests, co-op raids, player-versus-environment (PvE) combat and player-versus-player (PvP) combat with rewards in the native IGS token.  The game comes from the team who launched Tatsu.GG, which specializes in Discord bots promoting community gamification and engagement.  Early next month, Tatsumeeko will start the initial sale of Aethereal Parcels, non-fungible pieces of digital land that provide utility and special abilities to the holders and others who interact with the elements. The launch follows the November release of the Meekolony Pass series of NFTs on Solana, which carried in-game benefits and rewards and will allow holders to customize their avatars at a higher level than other players.  In the longer term, the game plans to expand to other social platforms like QQ, WeChat and Telegram, and to multiple communities on Ethereum and Solana.  ""Increasingly, the success of any gaming experience is dependent upon the community that stands behind it, and few can boast the ability to build and grow community the way the team at Tatsumeeko can,” said BITKRAFT Ventures associate Jamie Wallace in the press release. The foundation they have set in this capacity through a Discord-first approach is a remarkable achievement in itself, and a fantasy RPG is a natural next step in the team's mission to create experiences that bring digital communities together.”  Read more: Crypto Discord: Where to Go, What to Know",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL | SPONSORED | BNB,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/09/binance-labs-among-backers-of-76m-round-for-discord-game-tatsumeeko,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37e32b7879f870a7e24427bd491f2f1af873f3cd-5125x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394203,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZhAX,1654779000,How Bitcoin Could Power a New Wave of Small Business Innovation,"A few months ago, I wrote about how bitcoin (BTC) is the best form of money we’ve had access to historically. Now I’m looking closer at where the rubber meets the road when it comes to bitcoin and cryptocurrency: the impact they can have on small businesses.  According to the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), small businesses of 500 employees or fewer make up 99.9% of all U.S. businesses and 99.7% of firms with paid employees. Most financial advisers work with small business owners and are often sought-after clients. The following explains how bitcoin can affect them, drive margin growth and save them more capital.  Bitcoin has many different use cases, and often beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Block (SQ) recently published a report called “Bitcoin: Knowledge and Perceptions.” The report found that higher-income individuals see bitcoin primarily through an investment lens and its “potential to make money,” whereas those in lower-income brackets see through a payments lens or an “easy way to send money to others” (think underbanked and unbanked populations). The item that had almost equal weighting between both and finished second for both segments was “to purchase goods and services.”  I believe that it’s through the payments lens that small businesses can start to see a better financial future.  Fighting fee creep  Earlier this year, while at a local restaurant, I began talking to the owner about bitcoin and payments. He mentioned that 35%-40% of his transactions were once in cash; now they’re 5%. He said that he pays almost $100,000 a year for processing charges – all while his food prices are increasing double digits. His options: Raise prices and risk losing patrons, buy lower-quality food and risk reputational risk, or find some way to regain margin.  As consumers have shifted toward more credit card use, fees to merchants have increased in kind. A typical fee is 3.25%, and so for a business with $1 million in revenue, that’s $32,500 that’s just burned away. That’s significant, especially when you consider that the average or standard small business in the U.S. has a 10% profit margin, according to the Corporate Finance Institute, and only 40% of small businesses are profitable.  One solution: Small businesses could begin accepting bitcoin and add a “fiat surcharge.” This would both encourage bitcoin adoption and protect margins.  Putting your bitcoin to work  In addition, holding bitcoin allows a small business owner to better save for future purchases. A business that accepts bitcoin would be dollar-cost averaging (DCA) daily. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of bitcoin will fluctuate, but even with poor timing, it’s historically been 48%.  But wait, there’s more. The cost to process payments in bitcoin is less than for credit cards, and so you not only have “better” money, but also a lower cost to accept payment. OpenNode allows for payments on both the bitcoin blockchain and the Lightning Network (which was created as a way to scale bitcoin payments), charging 1% of each transaction.  Also, Stripe and OpenNode recently announced a partnership that will allow businesses to convert credit card payments directly to bitcoin as well, beefing up the dollar-cost averaging side of things.  To really go all the way with this, business owners could create their own self-sovereign ability to collect bitcoin payments using free open-source software like BTCPay Server. You don’t even have to run your own bitcoin node (though you could if you wanted to) because that part of it can be outsourced to a company like Voltage. OpenNode even offers a plug-and-play option that would handle the ability to have liquidity on the Lightning Network.  The BTCPay Server and Voltage setup requires more work, but it’s also remarkably efficient and inexpensive. I see a massive business opportunity around utilizing the Lightning for small business owners. Accessing liquidity via Lightning will drastically improve over the coming months with offerings like Flow, Magma, and Zero-Fee-Routing.  The taxman goeth  What about taxes? Today, in the U.S., the customer would have a capital gain or loss on any payments they make in bitcoin. The fantastic news is that some tools offer the ability to toggle between dollars and bitcoin (mainnet or Lightning), allowing this potential snag to be a nonissue. The biggest and most popular option is Strike. Strike allows a customer to connect to a legacy bank and then pay with a Lightning Network bitcoin on-chain invoice without having any tax implications.  I believe the taxable event attached to bitcoin payments will be removed soon. TheResponsible Financial Innovation Act from Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) would provide tax exclusion for payments up to $600. If passed, this would exempt almost all small business transactions, given the average again is $84, according to Experian.  What small business wouldn’t want an extra $15,000 to $30,000 annually in profit, with savings scaling as they grow? And what if they saw their business account compound, gaining purchasing power instead of losing it? What decisions and innovations would that bring? How many jobs could they create? I believe bitcoin will be not only a way small businesses can ease the pain of the current economy – but also a means for them to power a new wave of entrepreneurial growth.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Isaiah Douglass,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/09/how-bitcoin-could-power-a-new-wave-of-small-business-innovation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50af0a4d15b97f2fe1dbfbb2cffaf439c092e623-1366x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395358,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvnxJ,1654776306,Crypto Trading Firm Wintermute to Launch DEX on Ethereum,"Crypto market-making giant Wintermute is launching Bebop, a decentralized exchange (DEX) set to go live on Ethereum this summer.  Bebop will join the roster of existing DEXes on Ethereum, which includes Uniswap, SushiSwap and Curve.  “I believe that Bebop can be … more than just a tool to route to the best venue for execution,” said Evgeny Gaevoy, founder of Wintermute. “Bebop’s ambition is to redefine user experience in DeFi (decentralized finance), making the process of trading intuitive and hassle-free.”  Decentralized exchanges allow users to trade crypto tokens without the usual know-your-customer (KYC) checks, making them a popular alternative to centralized exchanges such as Coinbase (COIN) and Binance.  Unlike Uniswap and its various forks, the codebase for Bebop isn't open source, according to a Wintermute spokesperson.  The announcement comes on the heels of the April launch of Wintermute’s new zero-fee institutional trading platform, Wintermute Node.  Read More: Crypto Trading Firm Wintermute Launches Zero-Fee OTC Platform  What makes Bebop different?  One key feature of Bebop is its ability to swap one token for a portfolio of tokens and, conversely, swap a portfolio of tokens for one token, allowing traders to enter or exit multiple positions via a single trade.  Bebop says this feature will be “especially important in fast markets” and save users in transaction costs.  Unlike Uniswap or Binance Smart Chain’s PancakeSwap, which follows the automatic market maker (AMM) model, Bebop is a ""request for quote""-based (RFQ) platform.  In an RFQ model, customers submit an amount of a token or portfolios of tokens that they want to trade. Then, market makers respond with a customized quote.  “For one-to-one and multi-swap trades, Bebop utilizes an RFQ model for its exchange, where professional market makers provide top-quality liquidity to the protocol,” explained Bebop product manager Kat Fore. “For users, this means protection from unexpected slippage – they always transact at the price quoted.”  Additionally, Bebop will have a built-in “last look” mechanism, a feature common in foreign exchange markets that gives a market maker the ability to reject a trade for some period of time after the customer has agreed to the quote.  According to the spokesperson, Wintermute will be the sole liquidity provider for Bebop during the project’s soft launch. In future releases, Bebop will connect to other AMMs and start adding other liquidity providers.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/09/crypto-trading-firm-wintermute-to-launch-dex-on-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fdc2fbf8dd73d680d2d8a7ccc9fd9b5b44d5a784-6000x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The custody exchange network seeks to promote a fairer market structure, with no pre-funding needed and with safe participation by maintaining custody with Anchorage.  Exchanges, liquidity providers and custodians wanted to build a safe and segregated institutional custody vault, according to Diogo Monica, co-founder and president of Anchorage. There’s no conflict of interest between the institution that holds custody over a customer's assets and the institution that executes the exchange, Monica told CoinDesk.  “We actually genuinely believe it’s a better market structure going forward and answers a lot of the questions that regulators have had,” Monica said.  Crypto exchange Binance.US is part of the new network, and Anchorage has commitments from CoinList, Blockchain.com, Strix Leviathan, and Wintermute, according to a statement.  “As the American digital asset industry continues to mature, there is growing demand from institutions for custody, liquidity and enhanced market access,” Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder said in the statement. “By combining the advanced security of Anchorage with the best-in-class exchange technology of Binance.US, this integration eliminates multiple pain points to institutional trading, and marks a major milestone in the evolution of digital asset infrastructure.”  In March, Anchorage joined the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA), a policy group for the fund management industry that has more than 2,000 members, including most of the world’s hedge funds.

Early this year, the Terra blockchain was hailed to be the future of cryptocurrencies, as it seemed to promise several developmental advances. Then the protocol encountered a great shocker when its UST stablecoin and LUNA crypto token crashed drastically. The Terra Blockchain Launched in 2018 by the Terraform Labs and founded by Co-founders Do Kwon and Daniel Shin, Terra was a cryptocurrency protocol used to provide access to stablecoins. Recently, Kwon set his official Twitter account private, raising further suspicion that the token price may not be appreciated. According to market capitalization, the Terra protocol initially rose to become one of the ten leading blockchains in the world. It provided two unique tokens; the TerraUSD UST stablecoin and the LUNA utility coin, used for governance and to facilitate payments in the network. Since its inception in 2018, the Terra blockchain had been performing very well until mid-May 2022, when the blockchain saw a massive sell-off of the LUNA. The token&apos;s price dropped from around $120 to about $0.02 between 11th and 12th May.

42415297,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRnV6,1654745583,$15M of Optimism Tokens Stolen After Wintermute Sent Wrong Wallet Address,"Ethereum scaling tool Optimism announced Wednesday that attackers stole $15 million in OP governance tokens.  Optimism intended to send the funds to a crypto market maker, but the funds fell into the wrong hands when the market maker, Wintermute, provided Optimism’s team with a wrong blockchain address.  In a statement Wednesday, Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy took responsibility for allowing the theft, saying that ""we made a serious error.”  The attack followed a difficult couple of weeks for Optimism, whose botched OP token airdrop sent the token’s price tumbling in its first hours. The OP token fell an additional 20% after Wednesday’s news, according to the most recent data from CoinMarketCap.  What happened  In a blog post published Wednesday, Optimism’s team explained that it sent 20 million OP tokens to Wintermute two weeks ago in preparation for the much-hyped OP token airdrop.  The funds came from the Optimism Foundation’s Partner Fund, and Wintermute’s Gaevoy explained that the money – which came as a loan – would have been used to “provide liquidity in the OP token upon its listing on centralized exchanges.”  An opportunity for an attack came when Wintermute gave the wrong wallet address to Optimism. The money was supposed to be held in a multi-signature wallet belonging to Wintermute, but the address provided by Wintermute was for a wallet on Ethereum; it should have been an address on Optimism.  Gaevoy said Wintermute sought to retrieve the lost funds after noticing what happened, but an attacker beat Wintermute to the punch – draining the full 20 million OP tokens into a fresh Optimism wallet belonging to the attacker.  The attacker cashed out one million of the stolen OP tokens into Ethereum and then transferred those funds to an unknown address via Tornado Cash, a tool that allows people to send and receive funds with a scrambled source.  Blockchain security firm PeckShield noticed Wednesday that the attacker sent an additional one million tokens to an address belonging to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.  The remaining 18 million tokens remained in the attacker’s wallet at press time. As long as the tokens stay in the attacker's possession, the attacker will be able to vote on Optimism community governance proposals.  The Block reported that the attacker has delegated one million tokens to Ethereum Foundation security researcher Yoav Weiss, meaning Weiss will be able to vote on the attacker's behalf.  CoinDesk has seen no evidence suggesting Buterin or Weiss were involved with the theft of OP tokens.  “We are not sure why they chose not to liquidate all of [the tokens] at once,” Gaevoy said in his statement. “There is hope that it is a whitehat exploit … However we are currently operating under the premise that it is not the case.”  What is Optimism  Optimism is a layer 2 rollup chain for Ethereum – a separate blockchain that can process transactions, bundle them up and pass them back down to Ethereum. It helps to scale Ethereum’s “layer 1” network through quick transactions and lower fees.  The protocol, which has over $350 million in total value locked (TVL) according to DefiLlama, made headlines last month when it announced that it would be embarking on a much-hyped transition to community governance.  As part of its community handover, Optimism planned to airdrop its new OP token to active members of the Ethereum community.  What’s next  After noticing the error, Optimism sent an additional 20 million OP tokens to Wintermute. This time, Wintermute was required to put up $50 million in USDC as collateral.  Optimism’s decision to continue working with Wintermute has drawn the ire of some members of crypto Twitter, as has its decision to hold off on disclosing the attack until two weeks after the fact.  As for how Optimism will handle the stolen funds, it says the decision will be left to its community. Theoretically, the funds can be restored to the Optimism Foundation via a “hard fork,” an irreversible update to the chain's code.  Wintermute, for its part, says it is monitoring the attacker's address and “will proceed to buy OP every time the attacker sells it to make the protocol whole eventually.”     UPDATE (June 9, 15:43 UTC): Updated the article to reflect that the attacker sent one million tokens to Vitalik Buterin and delegated one million tokens to Yoav Weiss.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | OP | AIRDROP | FORKS,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/09/15m-of-optimism-tokens-stolen-by-an-attacker-after-wintermute-sent-wrong-wallet-address,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/44906982728c6443c61d16972ed10d1def36146d-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
