Users are only required to scan official identification documents and input personal data like phone numbers to use the ATM.

42424610,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2vb1h,1630096268,Market Wrap: Bitcoin and Stocks Rise on Dovish Fed,"Bitcoin rose along with stocks on Friday after a weeklong consolidation below the $50,000 resistance level. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $48,000 at press time and is up about 2% over the past 24 hours.  On Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank could taper asset purchases later this year as inflation gains appear to be temporary. Powell‚Äôs comments contributed to a weaker dollar and higher bitcoin price as concerns about a more immediate taper, or a winding down of the Fed‚Äôs monthly bond purchases, were put at ease.  ‚ÄúCertain crypto analysts see tapering as an issue for bitcoin speculation as quantitative easing is thought to give investors the liquidity to invest in riskier assets,‚Äù Jonas Luethy, a trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  ‚ÄúThis summer‚Äôs main event for stimulus expectations is over, and risky assets are rallying after Powell delivered a dovish taper,‚Äù Edward Moya, an analyst at foreign exchange broker Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,386, +2.8%  Ether (ETH) $3,064, +3.8%  S&P 500: 4509.4, +0.9%  Gold: $1,818.6, +1.5%  10-year U.S. Treasury yield closed at 1.307%, versus 1.349% Thursday  Bitcoin price pattern  There has been a clear pattern of bitcoin buying toward the end of the week and profit-taking toward the middle of the week, according to research by FundStrat, a global advisory firm.  Bitcoin is recovering from a pullback this week, and appears to be tracking the weekly price pattern as shown in the chart below. The BTC price returned to above $48,000 at press time.  ‚ÄúWhile we are uncertain what the drivers behind this pattern are, we will look to see if we can once again complete our weekly smile,‚Äù FundStrat wrote in a Wednesday newsletter, referring to the concave shape of the price pattern.  Crypto vs. stocks  Bitcoin and ether are lagging popular tech stocks such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on a risk-adjusted basis over the past 90 days.  The chart below compares the Sharpe ratio of BTC and ETH with select stocks, according to data from IntoTheBlock. By this metric, investors have not been compensated by the sharp price swings in crypto relative to traditional stocks over the short term. On a one-year basis, however, Sharpe ratios are higher for BTC and ETH relative to popular tech stocks.  EToro CEO Yoni Assia told CoinDesk that traders on the platform have been rotating in and out of cryptos and meme stocks, possibly in search of high returns. In terms of risk, low volatility in both crypto and traditional markets over the past month has encouraged greater speculation.  Ether holds support  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is holding breakout support at around $3,000 and is up about 4% over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has been resolving extreme overbought levels since its Aug. 8 breakout, which typically precedes a period of consolidation.  Buyers will likely remain active at around the $3,000 support level as short-term momentum improves. ETH will need to break above immediate resistance at $3,400 in order to yield an upside target toward the all-time high of around $4,000.  Stablecoin supply growth  The stablecoin supply on exchanges has topped $19 billion, according to CryptoQuant. ‚ÄúThere is more dry powder in the system now that could flow into bitcoin,‚Äù CryptoQuant analyst Jan Wuestenfeld wrote.  The total market cap of stablecoins has exceeded $120 billion, which is more than double the number in March, according to CoinMarketCap.  ‚ÄúThis is likely driven by increased MN (Market Neutral) fund flows and more cash on the sidelines, looking for yield,‚Äù Rahul Rai, co-head of market neutral at crypto investment firm BlockTower, wrote on Twitter.  Embed: https://twitter.com/rahul_rai121/status/1430916151412854786  Altcoin roundup:  Ethereum faces chain split: Ethereum is experiencing a chain split due to a number of network validators, also called nodes, failing to upgrade their software, CoinDesk‚Äôs Christine Kim and Andrew Thurman report. On Tuesday, the developer team behind the popular Ethereum software client Geth released an emergency ‚Äúhotfix‚Äù to a security vulnerability in its code that would have prevented certain users from producing blocks. The Go Ethereum team had disclosed a vulnerability on Aug. 18, saying they would release a patch, but did not specify the exact nature of the vulnerability in an effort to prevent an attack. However, it would seem some users identified the exploit that was hotfixed by the Geth team and are now hacking into older versions of the Geth software.  Cardano‚Äôs ADA token surges as fresh buyers jump in: Cardano‚Äôs cardano token surged Friday, pushing gains this month to 112%, as the price fast approaches its all-time high. ADA was trading at $2.84 at press time, up 12% over the past 24 hours, according to data from Messari. The number of wallet addresses holding the asset for fewer than 30 days has increased by 10%, compared with last month, possibly a sign that fresh buyers are coming in, according to data from crypto research firm IntoTheBlock.  DeFi protocol Tranchess surpasses $1B in total value locked in two months: The Tranchess protocol, a chess-themed decentralized finance (DeFi) asset management platform, has been on a tear ever since it made its debut in June. Evidence of the popularity of the project, which is backed by investment firm Three Arrows Capital, can be found in its total value locked (TVL), which has risen to above $1.1 billion since the launch. TVL refers to the number of assets staked in a given protocol and is a way of determining popularity. As of press time, the TVL across DeFi protocols exceeded $150 billion, data shows.  Blockchain Role Playing Game MIR4 Launches in 170 Countries Alongside Utility Coin: MIR4, a blockchain-based multiplayer online role-playing game that features a utility cryptocurrency, has completed testing and is now live, according to a press release.

Ethereum All Exchanges Netflow Shows Huge Negative Spike As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the Ethereum all exchanges netflow showed a negative spike yesterday as 60k ETH exited exchanges. The all exchanges netflow is an indicator that&apos;s defined as the difference between the exchange inflows and the outflows. The &apos;inflow&apos; is the amount of Ethereum moving into exchanges from personal wallets. An increase in this value implies an increase in the supply of ETH for selling purposes or altcoin purchasing. The &apos;outflow&apos; is just the opposite; it&apos;s the number of coins exiting exchange wallets. When this metric moves up, it might mean there is a buying pressure in the market as more investors store their coins outside exchanges.

Getting caught posting something you don‚Äôt own is a reputational risk, and Crypto Twitter is a significant professional venue, so there‚Äôs a very clear status game afoot: The people who can display the most expensive NFT is showing off just how rich and successful they are.  NFTs, then, are tapping into some of our deepest instincts: Humans, just like our close chimpanzee relatives, are obsessed with social status and hierarchy.  Avatar NFTs leverage this with their issuance structure, which CryptoPunks somehow got right the first time out of the gate. Most of the avatar series are issued in large but strictly limited quantities of roughly 5,000 to 10,000. And they‚Äôre mostly algorithmically generated from a set of ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù with varying rarities, which creates a fairly simple internal hierarchy. At the same time, the wide variation in features makes it easier for buyers to choose something that speaks to their identity or taste.  Contrast that with ‚Äúart NFTs‚Äù ‚Äì that is, single pieces or very short-run multiples. The hierarchy of art across artists and styles is pretty nebulous and subjective by comparison to a huge coordinated set. Some CryptoPunks, clearly, are cooler or more rare than others, but the most coveted also make the rest of the set appealing. A single piece of art can have deep personal appeal but provides a less obvious connection to a (hierarchical) community.  The limited nature of these series is also crucial. Contrast CryptoPunks with CryptoKitties, an NFT series also released in 2017 that hasn‚Äôt had the staying power of the Punks. That may have something to do with their distinct art styles, but the ‚Äúbreeding‚Äù features built into CryptoKitties are likely their biggest Achilles‚Äô heel.  This sort of programmability is very interesting and remains an exciting frontier in NFT design. But in this case, it means there are just too many kitties ‚Äì theoretically, up to 4 billion. It seems to have really held down the price ‚Äì you can still buy a CryptoKitty, even some pretty early ones, for dust.  For the NFT avatar status game to hold, the emerging norms around their use on Twitter will need to be increasingly formalized. What‚Äôs unspoken among crypto insiders will need to be formalized as the trend spreads, particularly through software systems for publicly verifying ownership. Building entirely new NFT social networks is likely a fool‚Äôs errand, but users on platforms like Discord or YouTube would probably love a verified way to display their NFT avatars, whether on-site or third party. Eventually, they‚Äôll demand it.  That would mean even more chances for status-chasing human apes to exercise their instincts online, which sounds like money in the bank for NFT creators.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Z.

42421759,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpNtt,1630084954,Money Reimagined: OnlyFans and the Threat to Free Speech,"We‚Äôll probably never know exactly why OnlyFans reversed its short-lived decision to ban porn, but we can always speculate that cryptocurrency was part of it. It shows how the technology doesn‚Äôt need mass adoption to help forge more financial and personal freedom. The mere optionality it offers can mitigate financial intermediaries‚Äô ability to exercise arbitrary, extrajudicial power on behalf of governments. It‚Äôs the exercise of that power that made OnlyFans‚Äô initial move so disturbing. That‚Äôs the topic of this week‚Äôs column.  And in this week‚Äôs episode of the ‚ÄúMoney Reimagined‚Äù podcast, Sheila Warren and I kick off an ad hoc series of interviews with crypto OGs. We‚Äôll get key, long-time players in this space to tell their origin stories, share what they‚Äôve learned from their journeys and opine on where it‚Äôs all going.  You‚Äôre reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For the premiere, we interviewed Austin Hill, who is perhaps best known to crypto people as the first CEO of Blockstream. But he has a far bigger claim to OG status from his pioneering work in the pre-Bitcoin 1990s as an entrepreneur developing businesses built on privacy-preserving cryptography. Hill is an original ‚Äúcypherpunk‚Äù and his take on the world, where it‚Äôs headed, and what we need to do to fix it is fascinating.  Have a listen after reading the newsletter.  Don‚Äôt Let Bankers Censor Porn. It Hurts Democracy  It might seem a stretch to invoke a philosopher of the Enlightenment for a cryptocurrency column about an online subscription service being pressured to remove porn from its site.  But Baron de Montesquieu‚Äôs core argument for the ‚Äúseparation of powers‚Äù is made for situations like this.  You see, the real bogeyman in this past week‚Äôs OnlyFans porn saga ‚Äì in which the platform initially said it would evict more hundreds of thousands of creators from its site and then abruptly reversed course to declare it would keep them ‚Äì is not the popular site‚Äôs corporate owner, or even the banks that reportedly pressured it to remove the content. It‚Äôs the state.  Until the decision reversal, this was shaping up as an especially ugly case of government overreach. In allowing ‚Äì actually, encouraging ‚Äì financial gatekeepers to act as self-appointed sheriffs for a field of commerce that‚Äôs in all other respects entirely legal, the U.S. government was exercising something that greatly bothered Monteseqieu in 18th century France: arbitrary power.  Checks and balances  Think back to those Poli-Sci 101 classes on the separation of powers. The executive branch, with its police, prosecutors and regulators, executes the law. But it doesn‚Äôt create it. That‚Äôs the job of the legislature, which is in turn denied the authority and the weapons needed to enforce the rules it makes.  What you‚Äôre supposed to end up with is the Rule of Law, which makes everything nice and predictable. Only activities the legislature has deemed illegal are restricted by the state. It has no authority to act against anything that lawmakers haven‚Äôt outlawed.  However, in our modern financial system, which gives banks the power to issue credit, manage payments and, ultimately, create money, there‚Äôs a flaw in this design.  These privately owned institutions are uniquely positioned to control people‚Äôs behavior. Until the arrival of cryptocurrency, it has until now been virtually impossible to engage in non-cash commerce without the blessing of a bank. But banks themselves are beholden to government influence, mostly because they are so tightly bound by compliance rules set by statutes such as the Bank Secrecy Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and Sarbanes-Oxley. This essentially makes them agents of the State‚Äôs interest.  This is why the OnlyFans flip-flop offers a glimmer of hope. While the reversal was no doubt motivated by fears of losing revenue ‚Äì most of the more than $1 billion projected for this year is expected to come from porn ‚Äì it‚Äôs important OnlyFans did so after it ‚Äúsecured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community.‚Äù This suggests the bankers had secured assurances from authorities they were not going to run into compliance problems.  We‚Äôll probably never know what discussions took place for all the parties to shift their positions, but it‚Äôs worth speculating whether the recent emergence of a peer-to-peer payment alternative forced their hand. Cryptocurrency may not have directly come to the sex workers‚Äô rescue, but the very idea they could use it in lieu of credit cards, quite possibly contributed to what, in my view, was a victory for free speech and the Rule of Law.  Banks as guns for hire  As we‚Äôve discussed frequently in Money Reimagined, U.S. international economic hegemony arises directly from this relationship. The cooperation of banks in monitoring and reporting monetary transactions is integral to how the U.S. enforces sanctions against blacklisted members of rogue regimes. Banks aren‚Äôt just service providers to businesses and individuals; they are also off-the-books mercenaries, working on behalf of governments.  This tight relationship has led, far too often, to regulation by stealth. And it speaks to why one of cryptocurrency‚Äôs undeniably valuable use cases lies in it allowing people to exchange money peer-to-peer without gatekeepers and the risk of arbitrary, extrajudicial enforcement.  To repeat, pornography is legal. In fact, it‚Äôs constitutionally protected speech, as per a famous U.S. Supreme Court case won by Hustler founder Larry Flynt. Similarly, cannabis businesses are now legal or decriminalized in most U.S. states. And guns are legally sold pretty much everywhere across the U.S. Yet, all these industries frequently find themselves cut off from payments solutions, thanks to capricious bankers.  Read More: OnlyFans Shows How the Banking System Is Politicized | Nic Carter  The banks and their regulators would no doubt argue this had nothing to do with government orders, that this was a business decision made by private entities in the public interest to protect their reputation and brand.  Really? Think of Wall Street. Think of the excesses of the mortgage bubble and subsequent financial crisis of 2008. Think of every financial scandal you can name. Think of HSBC‚Äôs $1.9 billion settlement with federal authorities for facilitating money laundering with Mexican drug cartels. Banks will make money however they can; there‚Äôs no social conscience dictating decisions like this. It‚Äôs all CYA.  It‚Äôs not tinfoil hat-think to believe banks were pressured to do this by authorities. There‚Äôs plenty of precedent. Read up about ‚ÄúOperation Choke Point,‚Äù the 2013 program led by the U.S. Department of Justice‚Äôs investigations into banks doing business with firearm dealers, payday lenders and companies in other industries suspected of being prone to fraud and money laundering.  As with the content produced by OnlyFans creators, the business activities of companies targeted under Operation Choke Point were legal. Officials merely suspected that participants in these industries were somewhat more likely to be doing something illegal, so they instructed banks to cut them off. Such businesses weren‚Äôt prosecuted ‚Äì there was no legal grounds for doing so ‚Äì but they were denied the lifeline of payments.  If it ain‚Äôt illegal, don‚Äôt touch it.  For the record, there are legitimate concerns that parts of the porn industry enable exploitation and abuse. Investigations by Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times found many popular porn sites were doing a poor job of policing content featuring underage performers.  Still, the answer to that is surely to devise better methods for catching abusers, not to invalidate a business model that sex workers say has, sometimes for the first time, allowed them to safely earn a direct, disintermediated income without risking physical contact with potentially violent clients.  My personal view on porn is that if adults give consent for their images to be used in this manner, then they deserve free speech protections. On recreational drugs, I firmly believe that both individual liberty and broad social interests are best served by legalizing them. By contrast, I support gun control: For me, individual rights to self-defense and autonomy are trumped by a broader social interest in containing the harm caused by deliberate and accidental firearm deaths and injuries.  Certain libertarian readers might disagree with that last position of mine. But here‚Äôs the thing: If we can‚Äôt successfully agitate to convert our beliefs into law, what you or I think on this stuff is irrelevant. If the majority believes we should banish porn or outlaw guns, then to get what they want they must convince their democratically elected representatives in Congress to vote for that. If such laws aren‚Äôt enacted, then the executive branch has no business seeking backdoor ways to curtail these industries.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is the road to tyranny. I‚Äôm quite certain Montesquieu would agree with me.  The good news is we don‚Äôt have to follow the logic of the Enlightenment and storm the Bastille to depose the French monarchy and install a republic. We now have a far less violent means of subverting the state‚Äôs actions: cryptocurrency.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

He provided no concrete date for starting to taper or scale back the Fed‚Äôs $120 billion-a-month bond-buying program.  Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, jumped from $47,200 to $48,200 after earlier managing to remain above the key 200-day moving average support of around $46,000.  The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback‚Äôs value against major fiat currencies, dropped from 93.18 to 92.67 to trade 0.35% lower on the day, per data provided by TradingView.com.  Gold jumped 0.65% to $1,800 per ounce, and U.S. stock markets continued to trade positive; the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell by two basis points to 1.32%.  In the highly anticipated speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City‚Äôs annual economic symposium, Powell said the economy no longer needs as much policy support but the central bank should refrain from making an ‚Äúill-timed policy move‚Äù in response to this year‚Äôs ‚Äútransitory‚Äù rise in inflation.  Powell added the Fed could begin unwinding its asset purchase program before the year‚Äôs end, but stressed it would not necessarily lead to any hike in interest rates.  ‚ÄúThe timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test,‚Äù Powell said in prepared remarks for the virtual summit.  Powell‚Äôs taper talk is not surprising because several Fed officials recently hinted at the central bank kick-starting the process this year. However, Powell‚Äôs comments on interest rates seem to have convinced markets that rates are likely to remain low for a prolonged time, as evidenced from the uptick in the zero-yielding asset like gold and the decline in bond yields.  While bitcoin has bounced after Powell‚Äôs remarks, it still remains trapped in a descending channel on the hourly chart.

42376218,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHtx7,1630082652,Bitcoin Hashrate Could Return to Record Sooner Than Expected,"The Bitcoin hashrate, a measure of the total computational power being used to secure the blockchain network, could return to record levels sooner than previously expected as Chinese miners speed up their migration to alternate locales and U.S. miners expand capacity, according to industry experts.  The blockchain network‚Äôs hashrate reached its all-time high of roughly 180.6 exahashes per second in mid-May, following the bitcoin price rally early this year. It later plunged to about 84.3 exahashes per second in early July, after China started cracking down on crypto mining.  The seven-day moving average of bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate stood at 130 exahashes per second on Thursday, up more than 50% from the July low. And the network appears to be holding steady even after a difficulty adjustment this week that made it harder to mine new bitcoins.  Bitcoin was trading at $47,493 as of press time, gaining 2.9% in the past 24 hours. As recently as last month, the cryptocurrency was changing hands around $30,000, so the strong market may have lured some bitcoin miners back online while encouraging others to ramp up capacity.  The Bitcoin hashrate could return to its all-time high by the end of this year and will likely continue to rise, according to Sam Doctor, chief strategy officer at BitOoda.  ‚ÄúA month or two ago I would have thought that the recovery is still going to be slow and it will be the first quarter next year before we hit the previous high,‚Äù Doctor said. ‚ÄúBut the hashrate does appear to recover faster.‚Äù  The migration of Chinese miners, who have been shipping their rigs to places such as the U.S. and Kazakhstan, have been driving the recovery, according to Doctor.  Poolin, a crypto mining pool previously based in China, looks to build its own facility in the U.S. to host a total capacity of 200 megawatts in the next nine to 18 months. It has already secured a hosting site in the U.S. to resume some operations online, Alejandro De La Torre, vice president at mining pool Poolin, told CoinDesk in July.  ‚ÄúWe really wanted to put at least a certain percentage online,‚Äù De La Torre said.  ‚ÄúFor a lot of very expensive electrical equipment, like substations, transformers, these things take time to build and to buy,‚Äù according to De La Torre. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs gonna take a while before we have our own facility.‚Äù  In addition to Chinese miners‚Äô migration, American miners have also been expanding their capacity, according to Dave Perrill, CEO of crypto mining colocation company Compute North.  ‚ÄúThe large orders that were placed and were in progress prior to the Chinese ban are starting to come online,‚Äù he said.  Perrill believes it could take another six to 12 months before bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate hits the all-time high again.  ‚ÄúOnce we get to the all-time high, you‚Äôre gonna see an acceleration,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd over the course of the next 18 months to 24 months, I think the all-time high will 3x,‚Äù meaning it could increase threefold.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING,Frances Yue,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/27/bitcoin-hashrate-could-return-to-record-sooner-than-expected,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed2b65f630a8543d544e222abad1cccabbea7be0-1300x732.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374484,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZpvJ,1630076570,Ethereum Faces Chain Split as Node Operators Fail to Update Geth Hotfix,"Ethereum is experiencing a chain split due a number of network validators, also called nodes, failing to upgrade their software.  On Aug. 24, the developer team behind the popular Ethereum software client Geth released an emergency hotfix to a security vulnerability in its code that would have prevented certain users from producing blocks.  The Go Ethereum team had disclosed a vulnerability on Aug. 18, saying they would release a patch, but did not specify the exact nature of the vulnerability in an effort to prevent an attack:  ‚ÄúThe exact attack vector will be provided at a later date to give node operators and dependent downstream projects time to update their nodes and software,‚Äù wrote Ethereum team lead P√©ter Szil√°gyi in Aug. 24 GitHub patch notes.  However, it would seem some users identified the exploit that was hotfixed by the Geth team and are currently exploiting older versions of the Geth software.  Though the Geth team emphasized that all users should upgrade their software immediately, only about 30% of users have upgraded to the latest version, according to data from ethernodes.org.  As background, Geth is the most relied-upon software to connect to the Ethereum blockchain, being run by roughly 75% of the users.  Read more: Ethereum‚Äôs Most Popular Software Client Issues Hotfix to High Severity Bug  A matter of time  In an interview with CoinDesk, Go Ethereum developer Marius Van Der Wijden, who noted he was speaking in a personal capacity and not as a representative of the Ethereum Foundation or Go Ethereum, said that after the disclosure an exploit was inevitable.  ‚ÄúI knew that someone would eventually find the bug,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just hoped that more people would have updated in time.‚Äù  He called on node operators to follow client teams on social media channels for updates, and noted that he‚Äôd be pushing for an open mailing list for ‚Äúdistributing critical information.‚Äù  Ultimately, however, he felt the team responded swiftly and appropriately to the vulnerability.  ‚ÄúI feel pretty good about our response. Once [we were] alerted to the potential chain split we found the offending transaction in a matter of minutes,‚Äù he said.  He confirmed to CoinDesk a particular Ethereum address was the cause of the attack, but declined to explain the nature of the exploit bec auseit has already been replicated on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon.  He noted that software security expert Guido Vranken was first to discover the bug, having found it during an audit of Telos‚Äô virtual machine using a technique called ‚Äúfuzzing.‚Äù  Take a walk  This is not the first time Ethereum has experienced a chain split due to users running outdated versions of Geth.  In November, the Ethereum network saw a similar disturbance after users failed to upgrade to the latest Geth release, version 1.10.X. At the time, Geth developers said the event was due to a lack of communication about the urgency of the upgrade.  This time around, Geth developer Szil√°gyi emphasized the team would do things differently by openly communicating with the public about the security vulnerabilities of the older client version.  ‚ÄúLast time we did a hotfix, people were angry that we didn‚Äôt announce it. This time we decided to try it differently. Let‚Äôs see which works better,‚Äù Szil√°gyi tweeted.  Likewise, the official Go Ethereum Twitter channel noted that this vulnerability was patched, and urged users to upgrade their client:  It seems neither has worked in preventing a chain split on Ethereum.  Ethereum community leaders such as developer Andre Cronje have since called on users to ‚ÄúStay away from doing txs [transactions] for a while,‚Äù and to ‚ÄúGo for a walk outside, we all need it.‚Äù  Geth developers are actively communicating with users through a Discord channel to urge more users to upgrade their software. The chain split is likely to resolve itself as more users upgrade to the newest Geth version.  The longest chain  Part of the chain split was attributable to a handful of powerful miners continuing to use the faulty Go client, including Flexpool, BTC.com and Binance. According to Ethereum Foundation developer Tim Beiko, developers had managed to contact both BTC.com and Binance as of 1 p.m. ET today:  However, as another Geth developer pointed out, the majority of miners were operating the patched client at the time of the exploit, and the majority of the hashpower continued to operate on the canonical chain.  Ethereum is currently operating normally.  UPDATE (Aug. 27, 18:10 UTC): Adds comments from Go Ethereum developer Marius Van Der Wijden.

The six-time Super Bowl wner is an American superstar and his off-field venture, Autograph, is thrivg. But Autograph is not just the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback‚Äôs dog. Behd it stands 23-year-old Dillon Rosenblatt.  The son of entrepreneur Richard Rosenblatt, Dillon Rosenblatt came to his own entrepreneurship early. He got a first-class education at the prestigious USC Iove and Young Academy, a school for young entrepreneurs. At age 15, Rosenblatt created his first company, an app called Tutor that was designed to brg students and tutors together.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always had an entrepreneurial spirit and hunger, growg up an entrepreneurial household, it was always my dream and what I wanted to do,‚Äù he said.  Now he gets to work with a legend, who just happens to be a friend of the family.  We talk every day about the business. He‚Äôs really interested in the story telling.  ‚ÄúIt was a mix of pre-existing interest in sports and the relationship with Tom that led to this,‚Äù Rosenblatt said. ‚ÄúTom wanted to be one of the bigger names leading the charge of stepping into this world.‚Äù  Rosenblatt first heard about crypto in college. In 2019, he noticed the NFT space and projects like NBA Top Shot. However, it was when he was working on a crypto hedge fund idea that he started looking deeper into the NFT space and started thinking about the concept of taking talent and concepts mainstream and adapt them to the digital world.  ‚ÄúA light bulb just went off in my head and the whole concept of ‚Äòlet‚Äôs bring the most amazing people we can together and become the official partner to the world‚Äôs biggest talent,‚Äô‚Äù Rosenblatt said. ‚ÄúFrom that moment I brought it to Tom and to the people around me that I knew could really help move the needle.‚Äù  Autograph has launched several sports NFT collections with athletes across the world since its launch in April, the latest in cooperation with four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka.  The choice to work with athletes came from Rosenblatt‚Äôs interest in football (his favorite team? The Seattle Seahawks, perhaps the one thing on which he and Brady disagree) and his prior relationship with Brady. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been a big football fan and we had known Tom years prior, with his interest in the space,‚Äù Rosenblatt said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always been a dream to work with Tom in some capacity.‚Äù  Sports collectibles were an easy way to step into the digital art space because owning an autograph or a signed baseball in the physical world has been a trend for many generations, Rosenblatt said.  While Tom Brady is among the list of talents whose autographs can be bought and owned through platforms like DraftKings, one of Autograph‚Äôs partners, Brady wants to be seen as a business person in this company.  ‚ÄúPeople would be surprised with how involved Tom is. He is available for a call or text every time and we have a casual shorthand from working and talking together so much. We talk every day about the business. He‚Äôs really interested in the story telling,‚Äù Rosenblatt said.  The success of the company, however, is thanks to the rise of the NFT market and increasing global interest, Rosenblatt said, and that is what gave him the ability to convince Brady and others, such as entertainment company Lionsgate, that getting involved in Autograph is a risk worth taking.

42376215,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHttL,1630073917,Fed‚Äôs Powell Signals Tapering Timeline Is Less Clear Because of Delta Variant,"The U.S. Federal Reserve is planning to keep quantitative easing loose ‚Äì encouraging spending and investing ‚Äì for a little while longer.  This means that for now the market will continue to have more liquidity making it easier for investors to spend on riskier assets like bitcoin. Following the release of Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs prepared remarks at 14:00 UTC, the price of bitcoin rose 0.8% to $47,680 and has continued to rise since then.  At the Fed‚Äôs virtual Jackson Hole symposium, Powell said Friday the central bank‚Äôs goals for progress on inflation had been met, that there had been progress toward maximum employment and that the timing of tapering would not dictate the timing of an increase in interest rates.  Recent jobs prints have been north of 800,000 jobs added per month, but the path of the COVID-19 pandemic and its virus variants creating another wave of infections has increased macroeconomic uncertainty.  ‚ÄúAt the FOMC‚Äôs recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year,‚Äù Powell said, referring to the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) which sets monetary policy for the U.S. central bank. ‚ÄúThe intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks.  ‚ÄùEven after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions,‚Äù Powell added.  The chair‚Äôs comments likely means that there is a ‚Äúzero chance‚Äù the central bank tapers in September, said Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability. Kelly added that there might be ‚Äúslightly more detail‚Äù about when the bank might slow asset purchases in September.  Powell‚Äôs speech reflected the central bank‚Äôs understanding that it has undershot both its full employment goals and inflation goals in the past.  ‚ÄúIf a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúThe ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.‚Äù  Powell also noted there has been elevated inflation in the cost of durable goods, but that sector has experienced an ‚Äúannual inflation rate well below zero over the past quarter-century.‚Äù The Fed chair has characterized high inflation in recent months as ‚Äútransitory.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/27/feds-powell-signals-that-tapering-could-come-by-the-end-of-the-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2da2a605a8ef833124a013658f043bb2eabb7980-2858x1598.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376224,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHu4f,1630058903,"Ether‚Äôs Daily Issuance Drops Below Bitcoin, IntoTheBlock Says","Ether, the native token of Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain, looks to have become more scarce than bitcoin since the activation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559.  Data tweeted by Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, shows ether‚Äôs daily annualized net issuance fell to 1.11% earlier this week versus bitcoin‚Äôs 1.75%.  Daily issuance refers to the number of coins mined. In the case of ether, the figure is adjusted for the amount of ether burned.  EIP 1559, which went live on Aug. 5, burns a portion of fees paid to the miners, removing a notable chunk of coins from circulation. Since activation, the upgrade has eliminated over 100,000 ETH, representing 36% of the new coins issued over the same period, according to data source Etherchain.  The amount of ether burned is tied to network usage, which has surged in the past two weeks, thanks to the boom in the non-fungible tokens (NFT) space. According to Dune Analytics, NFT marketplace OpenSea is the biggest ether burner to date, having destroyed 15,697 ETH, an equivalent of $49 million at ether‚Äôs current price of $3,120. Other top contributors are decentralized finance protocol Uniswap, stablecoin issuer Tether and NFT game Axie Infinity.  Such has been the frenzy that ether became a deflationary asset, with the number of coins burnt being higher than issued, on several occasions in the past two weeks.  If the trend continues, ether could attract store-of-value demand, which until now has been concentrated mainly toward bitcoin. The pace of bitcoin‚Äôs supply expansion is reduced by 50% every four years by a programmed code called the mining reward halving.  ‚ÄúEther‚Äôs decreasing issuance raises questions about how it is valued,‚Äù Outumuro tweeted. ‚ÄúPreviously closer to digital oil, ETH‚Äôs value moved in tandem with its usage; now that its issuance is probably lower (and potentially deflationary), it is likely to develop a monetary premium like BTC.‚Äù  Ether is currently priced at $3,110, and bitcoin is changing hands near $47,200, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) exchange rate is 0.065 on Binance, having rallied from 0.057 to 0.073 in the days leading up to the EIP 1559 release.

To keep up with their pace of development, the company is raising funds from user contributions through a crowdloan, with the goal of procuring a popular tool called a parachain in the upcoming weeks. Composable has been making great strides towards obtaining and building its parachain, Picasso, which will be on Kusama, the canary network of the Polkadot blockchain. Parachains are project-specific blockchains that enable communication and data transfers to happen seamlessly across blockchains in the Polkadot ecosystem. The Picasso parachain thus serves as a key component to the interoperable future that Composable envisions. Specifically, Composable is working to build its parachain Picasso with all of the building blocks (called pallets) necessary to introduce a complete DeFi ecosystem to Polkadot.

The dramatic price swings in a relatively short time compared to traditional investment instruments can result in fantastic profits for traders who play their cards right.

The metaverse is an evolving ecosystem that will continue to grow as more people use it. It&apos;s a new frontier that we are all exploring and discovering, but let&apos;s look at two early players blazing trails in this area: Next Earth and Earth 2. Next Earth is building a virtual world on top of Ethereum. It&apos;s a decentralized platform that allows anyone to create and monetize virtual real estate through NFTs. The Next Earth team has been hard at work building the tools, infrastructure, and developer community needed to make this vision a reality, in addition to recently running the world&apos;s first ITO, or Initial Tile Offering [Editor&apos;s Note: Link to ITO article]. In contrast, the goal of Earth 2 is to build a centralized virtual world, where the virtual assets are, at the end of the day, located on central servers instead of being truly user-owned. Centralized vs. Decentralized Metaverse Let&apos;s compare and contrast the idea of a centralized versus decentralized metaverse. Decentralized Metaverse: Next Earth Decentralized metaverses have been gaining traction in recent months. In a decentralized metaverse, users own their assets and data, and can interact with each other without the need for middlemen like brokers, gatekeepers, or other third parties.
