42429607,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM05Nh,1535656865,Ripple Scores Small Win Against Investors Claiming XRP Is a Security,"Ripple's efforts to consolidate multiple lawsuits filed against it are proceeding successfully.  As reported by CoinDesk, Ripple, which has been sued by a number of parties claiming the XRP token it uses to power some of its products is a security, has been pushing to have the various class action lawsuits against it combined, or at least coordinated, to limit the number of cases it fights at once.  On Wednesday, a California Superior Court suit filed by investor David Oconer was formally designated as ""complex litigation"" – meaning it will now be coordinated with the remaining suits.  According to public filings, this follows another California case, filed by investor Vladi Zakinov, which has already been deemed complex as of June 2018.  Under California court rules, one of the requirements for a complex designation is that a case involves ""securities claims or investment losses involving many parties."" With the new designation, a single judge should oversee actions relating to the case to prevent duplicated efforts and potentially different results due to different cases.  However, one result of the Oconer action is the case is now assigned to Judge Marie Weiner, who Ripple successfully moved to disqualify from presiding over the Zakinov case. It is unclear whether Ripple will again move to have the judge disqualified from the new preceding.  Ripple filed to coordinate the Zakinov and Oconer lawsuits earlier this month, claiming that the two class actions concern ""'all or a material part of the same subject matter' and involve 'all or substantially all of the same parties.'""  Another related class-action lawsuit, filed by investor Ryan Coffey, was voluntarily dismissed by the investor last week. That case was moved to the District Court of the Northern District of California by Ripple, though Coffey tried to move it back to a lower court. His voluntary dismissal comes after that effort was rejected.  Legal counsel for Coffey and Ripple did not respond to requests for comment by press time.

Satis Group published the latest report in its five-part analysis of the cryptocurrency ecosystem Friday, this time examining how the cryptocurrency market is valued and whether this valuation matches the actual assets underlying token prices. The report, written by researchers Sherwin Dowlat and Michael Hodapp, also created predictions for how the market might look over the next few years.  Notably, the report attempted to predict how different cryptocurrency prices might look over the next five years if valued based on the underlying assets rather than speculation, saying that coins like bitcoin, monero and decred should see their prices spike as they are ""cryptoassets which apply unique value propositions within deep and viral markets.""  On the other hand, the researchers believe that coins like bitcoin cash and other ""cryptoassets which attempt to inherit brand recognition and provide minimal technological advantage to incumbents"" will drop. Coins like XRP received the harshest predictions, with the Satis Group saying the token would drop to $0.01.  The report explained:  ""Within the currency networks, we continue to see upside in networks that have cultivated relatively organic growth and community (such as LTC), meaningful downside from networks that have inherited brand recognition and potentially short-lived adoption during hiccups from their fork-parent (such as BCH), and very little value in networks that are misleadingly marketed and not even required for use within their own network (such as XRP).""  The paper also addressed ""platform networks"" like ethereum, predicting that over the next 10 years, a smaller percent of token projects will be built on top of ethereum rather than other networks when compared to the present (a previous Satis Group report noted that ethereum has roughly 86 percent of the market share for projects being built on top of existing platforms).  That being said, ""at current levels we still believe ETH to be undervalued relative to the share of the cryptoasset market's TAM it targets,"" citing the cryptocurrency's liquidity and reputation as supporting the overall network.

Dubbed Project Concord, VMware's blockchain aims to provide a base for blockchain implementations which can solve certain scaling issues by modifying the Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus algorithm commonly found in blockchain networks.  Senior researcher Guy Golan Gueta wrote in a company blog post that the project's algorithm uses a different communication procedure than existing consensus protocols that ""exploits optimism to provide a common case fast-path execution"" and utilizes new cryptographic algorithms.  These upgrades from current protocols allow for a higher network throughput, he said.  VMware, a Dell subsidiary, has been working on Project Concord for roughly two years, and while some of its research has been published over the last few months, this week's release marks the first time the company has publicly acknowledged how much work has gone into developing a blockchain infrastructure.  ""Project Concord's foundations stem from years of academic and industrial research on Byzantine Fault Tolerant replication, cryptography and distributed computing,"" Gueta said, adding:  ""The cryptocurrency revolution and, in particular, bitcoin and ethereum have also tremendously influenced our understanding of this emerging field of trust decentralization. The Project Concord library is designed to be used as a core building block for replicated distributed data stores and is thus especially suited to serve as the basis for highly scalable, permissioned enterprise blockchain systems.""  The team's source code has already been posted to Github, with Gueta noting that the company intends to add a number of other features going forward.  Among these, he wrote, is an execution engine for ethereum virtual machine-based smart contracts. Other additions include support for Windows, Apple's OSX and some Linux distributions, as listed by Project Concord's Github.  The Github page adds that the team ""welcomes contributions from the community,"" though contributors will be required to sign a license agreement.

The effort apparently comes in response to a rapidly changing landscape of digital payments and the ""rising costs of managing fiat paper/metallic money,"" the bank said.  A news report from the Economic Times on Thursday further indicated the RBI also said that, for 2018, the cost of printing paper notes alone totaled nearly $90 million.  While the RBI did not reveal whether the potential CBDC may be blockchain-powered, it claimed the utilization of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in payment and settlement solutions ""holds the promise of significant economic benefits in future.""  Meanwhile, in contrast to its support for adoption of DLT at a state level, the RBI again toughened its stance on crypto trading in the report, shifting its focus to transactions between individuals following its ban on bank accounts for exchanges announced in April.  ""Developments on this front need to be monitored as some trading may shift from exchanges to peer-to-peer mode, which may also involve increased usage of cash,"" the RBI warned in its yearly report, adding:  ""Possibilities of migration of crypto exchange houses to dark pools/cash and to offshore locations, thus raising concerns on anti-money /CFT and taxation issues, require close watch.""

42429595,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM04vh,1535633980,Polychain Leads Ether Wallet MyCrypto's $4 Million Fundraise,"Ethereum wallet MyCrypto just raised $4 million in its ongoing effort to make its product more user-friendly, the startup announced Thursday.  Led by Polychain Capital, the Series A funding round also saw investments from Boost VC Fund 3 LP, ShapeShift, Ausum Blockchain Fund LP, Mainframe founder Mick Hagen, Coefficient Ventures partner Chance Du, early Dropbox employee Albert Ni and Earn co-founder Lily Liu, according to a press release.  The funds will go toward upgrading MyCrypto's user experience to help new customers more easily purchase and transact with ethereum, said founder and CEO Taylor Monahan.  Monahan told CoinDesk that one of the biggest issues she sees in the space is the difficulty in actually buying or transacting with cryptocurrencies. To that end, MyCrypto intends to hire developers and designers to target consumers who are beginning to interact with cryptocurrencies for the first time.  She said:  ""Right now our team is really all engineers and customer support people and I think we need to build out a team that just advocates for the user more and has a ton of experience in user interface and design. Specifically, I'm looking for experts that don't have a cryptocurrency background to join the team because their strength is outside the space.""  And part of this push means changing MyCrypto's target user base, according to Monahan.  ""The example to this is the ICO [craze] that took off last year, our user was someone who had ether and wanted to participate in an ICO. That's our market, that's the type of person that we targeted back then, that's the type of person we're targeting right now and our experience is satisfactory for that user,"" she explained.  Going forward, she intends to ask different questions about users.  ""When a brand new person comes to our site, what happens, what does the flow look like, what do we recommend they do and how do we really build their confidence up, whether it's buying cryptocurrency or sending someone some ETH or whatever it is,"" she said.  MyCrypto does not have a firm timeline for its development goals yet, but Monahan plans to be ready for the next time interest in cryptocurrency spikes. She pointed at the late 2017 bull run as an example of what that interest might look like, but added that the relatively quiet period in the market has helped in terms of developing a product.  ""Right now we're just building ... I think that huge pendulum swing [last year] is why we're in such a bear market right now, we went way too far ... I think that at some point the market is going to realize or see the value that's being created by all these different products in the space,"" she said.

42429603,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM05Bh,1535633957,8 Blockchain Projects Enlist Early to Test Secret Enigma Contracts,"Can you keep a secret?  For many blockchain projects – whose underlying architecture is a public ledger of transactions – that can be a challenging ask. But Enigma, a project incubated at MIT Media Lab that raised $45 million in an ICO last year, is hoping to make that possible by developing privacy-enabled smart contracts it calls ""secret contracts.""  And in a sign of the broad applicability of that idea, as revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, eight diverse blockchain projects will be incorporating Enigma's protocol into their services when the contracts launch later this year.  These ""launch partners,"" said Enigma co-founder and CEO Guy Zyskind, are already building on the current version of the technology, called ""Discovery,"" within the testnet, so when the protocol actually goes live, they'll be processing user's data without revealing it to any outside party.  Blockchains have always had a complicated relationship with privacy. Despite bitcoin's early adoption by Silk Road drug pushers, the cryptocurrency has proven to be far from anonymous.  And in recent years, smart contract platforms such as ethereum have struggled to reconcile the public nature of on-chain data with users' privacy demands – especially when it comes to sensitive use cases.  Enigma's protocol is notable in that it works on top of existing blockchains. Sure enough, several of the launch partners – Colendi, Datawallet, Ocean Protocol, ReBloc and Datacoup – are built (or are building) on ethereum.  The protocol ensures user data ""stays completely encrypted from the point of view of the network parties that are executing these secret contracts,"" said Zyskind, while remaining ""tamper proof"" like a normal smart contract.  He added:  ""If you're thinking about true blockchain adoption, you've got to have both. No one is going to build applications where sensitive information is just live on the blockchain for everyone in the world to see.""  Stop oversharing  We live in a world of oversharing – from what people ate for lunch to what they think about their boss to how much they drank last night.  And while that has proven problematic for some, it's generally seen as the prerogative of the poster.  But some data needs to stay private. For instance, Colendi – one of Enigma's launch partners – is building an ethereum-based application for both decentralized credit scoring and microlending.  Bulent Tekmen, the project's co-founder, said Colendi ""requires sensitive information from borrowers,"" such as bills, bank statements and national identification numbers. Not only does Enigma's protocol allow such data to be run through Colendi's algorithms in an encrypted form, it also avoids creating an Equifax-like honeypot for hackers to go after, he suggested.  This idea that some data is too sensitive to put on a public blockchain is the same reason Ocean Protocol plans to use the Engima protocol.  While Ocean Protocol is creating ""a decentralized ecosystem aimed at unlocking data for AI consumption,""said co-founder Don Gossen, some datasets cannot be bought and sold unencrypted. Ocean's white paper lists medical data as an example.  As such, Enigma ""makes logical sense"" for Ocean's marketplace, Gossen said.  Another data marketplace launch partner is Datawallet, which aims to let users monetize data from applications, such as social media, by selling them to advertisers, for example. The application's goal is ""complete user empowerment and data ownership,"" CEO Serafin Lion Engel told CoinDesk.  In Datawallet's case, Engel said, the protocol will provide Sybil protection, that is, prevent bad actors from spinning up multiple digital identities to swamp the platform. While plugging in existing social media accounts is a good way to provide such protection, Enigma's Zyskind added, some ""people don't want to connect their Facebook account and give you their data.""  Enigma also announced partnerships with Portal Network, which turns wallet and smart contract addresses on multiple blockchains into human-readable IDs; Eximchain, a supply chain solution based on Quorum; ReBloc, an ethereum-based real estate data marketplace; 2key, a second-layer network that aims to disrupt social networks; and Datacoup, a platform for monetizing personal data, which is transitioning to ethereum.  More to come  Enigma has not announced an exact date for launching the Discovery network live, but Zyskind said that the deadline is the end of 2018. When the protocol is live, computers or ""nodes"" on the network will be incentivized to perform secret contract operations with the native ENG tokens Enigma sold in its ICO.  For those familiar with the Enigma white paper, which caused a minor sensation when it was published in 2015, Discovery represents an intermediate step to the fully fledged Enigma protocol.  The network described in the white paper would run computations on encrypted data using a process known as secure multiparty computation (SPMC), in which encrypted information is split up into separate pieces for different nodes to work on separately – while still encrypted.  It's then reassembled into a final, encrypted result.  In other words, the smart contracts perform operations on the data without ever having – or getting – to decrypt it, so this approach is considered especially secure.  What's more, even if all the nodes were able to break the encryption, they would all have to collude to reconstruct the original, sensitive data. A single honest node could prevent the data from leaking.  While that's the end goal, though, that technology won't be ready for the initial launch.  The mainnet launch of Discovery will bring secret contracts to ethereum, but they'll be housed in what are called trusted execution environments (TEEs), rather than functioning through SMPC.  Zyskind said TEEs still provide excellent security, however, because ""any input data that needs to go inside the computation, inside the execution, is being encrypted on the outside with a key that only exists inside the enclave.""  As for SMPC, Zyskind said:  ""Expect it in 2019.""

BTC.com, which claims to have mined 21 percent of all bitcoin blocks last year, will offer the new mining client through its pool.btc.com portal, and will also offer an ethereum block explorer and API, according to a press release. The service will allow miners to switch their hashing power from one pool to another, depending on the market.  The move is part of an effort to ""help ethereum scale its mining infrastructure,"" the announcement stated.  Bitmain's project director Zhong Zhuang said that the firm hopes ""to expand ethereum's network by relaying ... rewards through our [Full Pay Per Share] system,"" which rewards miners for participating in the pool.  Notably, the new pools will include GPU and CPU mining options, the release indicated, despite the fact that Bitmain released its first ethereum-focused application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for ethereum earlier this year.  Zhuang explained that the decision to offer GPU and CPU mining comes from the depressed prices across the crypto market this year, telling CoinDesk that ""GPU miners are versatile, still profitable and are not easily replaced in a bear market. It's common for miners to split investment into both.""  He added:  ""Also, there are already ASIC miners for ethereum and ethereum classic which are easier to set up and are dedicated to ethash mining. This will save us from supporting a huge list of GPU coins simultaneously.""  Going forward, BTC.com may consider launching mining pools for ""popular coins"" such as litecoin, zcash and monero, though no concrete plans have yet been made, Zhuang said – although, before any new additions, the service would have to consider a token's network, the quality of its code, its development roadmap and trading volume.

42429613,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM05Vh,1535626822,Bitcoin's Price Pullback Risks Bear Revival Below $6.9K,"Bitcoin (BTC) bulls need to defend key support at $6,905 to avoid invalidation of the short-term bullish outlook, technical charts suggest.  Having hit a peak of $7,139 Wednesday, the leading cryptocurrency is currently trading around $6,920 on Bitfinex – down 2 percent on a 24-hour basis.  The drop does not come as a surprise, however, as the 21 percent rally witnessed in the last two weeks was looking overstretched yesterday.  More notably, the short-term bull case would weaken if BTC finds acceptance below the 100-day moving average (MA) of $6,905.  Daily chart  BTC created a ""spinning top"" candle yesterday, which, when viewed against the backdrop of the 21 percent rally from the low of $8,507, likely represents bullish exhaustion.  Looking ahead, a UTC close below the 100-day MA lined up at $6,905 would validate the spinning top candle and shift risk in favor of a downside break of the rising wedge.  Acceptance below the wedge support would confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change, that is, the rally from the low of $5,859 has ended and the bigger downtrend from the July high of $8,507 has resumed. In this case, BTC could revisit recent lows below $6,000.  Hence, the bulls need to defend the 100-day MA of $6,905 to keep the short-term bullish outlook intact. That may be a tough call, though, as the short duration charts are pointing to an increased risk of further losses.  4-hour chart  As seen in the above chart, BTC has breached the rising trendline in favor of the bears. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has taken out the ascending trendline support. As a result, the emboldened bears may push the cryptocurrency down to the ascending (bullish) 50-candle MA, currently located at $6,735.  View  A UTC close below $6,905 would confirm a spinning top bearish reversal and strengthen the odds of a downside break of the rising wedge pattern.  A rising wedge breakdown would signal a resumption of the sell-off from the July high of $8,507 and could yield a drop to $6,000 (February low).  A close today above the 100-day MA would keep the bulls in the game and allow a sustained move above $7,200 in the next couple of days.

On Thursday, South Korean provincial governors hosted a meeting with President Moon Jae-in to discuss job creation in the country. In his remarks, Governor Won Hee-ryong of the Jeju province proposed to the president that the island should be designated as a special hub for blockchain to allow companies to conduct ICOs, as CoinDesk Korea reports.  Won argued that, by doing so, the region would create at least 1,600 more jobs by attracting both domestic and foreign companies wishing to launch ICOs – especially those whose home jurisdictions prohibit token sale fundraising, such as China.  He said:  ""If Jeju Island is designated as a blockchain special zone, international standards and regulations on cryptocurrency should be created to ensure that blockchain and crypto companies that are promoting sound businesses both domestically and abroad can conduct businesses in the province.""

42429601,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM055h,1535616019,Ethereum's Next Upgrade Could Be the $29 Billion Blockchain's Biggest Test Yet,"Hard forks are never easy.  By definition, such system-wide upgrades require every software user to upgrade to new rules near-simultaneously, meaning there's coordination difficulties that need to be overcome to ensure the code continues to operate as designed. Still, in a upcoming October upgrade named Constantinople, ethereum is faced with a perhaps unique challenge — how to find a balance between a web of diverse stakeholders, each battling for different outcomes.  Making matters more complex, there's a hard deadline for the upgrade, currently set for October. Predicted sometime in early 2019, a piece of code known as the difficulty bomb is scheduled enact, thereby making ethereum's blocks steadily less time efficient to mine.  If no action is taken, the difficulty bomb will push ethereum into what is known as the ""ice age,"" a period wherein the difficulty is so high that transactions can no longer be processed, making the blockchain unusable. (The bomb was originally included in the code to encourage the platform to quickly adopt new technology).  Because delaying the difficulty bomb also impacts ether inflation (the time it takes to mine blocks is directly correlated to the quantity of ether distributed on the platform), ethereum is under pressure to upgrade its code before the bomb hits.  But, at present, a path forward remains unclear.  With a total of four ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) currently under discussion, many are arguing that in delaying the difficulty bomb, Constantinope should also reduce the amount of ether that is currently paid out to miners, the entities that run specialty computing hardware to secure transactions.  However, miners are warning that too great a decrease in profits will reduce the security of the network, effectively forcing miners to secure other cryptocurrencies. (Concerns are especially great for GPU miners, which are now currently competing with ASICs, machines specialized for cryptocurrency mining and little else).  While an exact timeline for Constantinople has yet to be finalized, developers are pointing to late October or November as the likely timeline for the upgrade (any later could risk intersecting with the difficulty bomb). As such, in an upcoming meeting on Friday, developers are likely to finalize the EIPs to be included in the upcoming hard fork.  Communications officer for Parity Technologies, Afri Schoedon, told CoinDesk:  ""We are moving toward a decision with fast steps now.""  Balancing act  At the time of writing, there are three EIPs to be included in the upcoming hard fork that aren't controversial at all, and have already been implemented in code and are currently undergoing testing.  These include EIP 145, EIP 1014, and EIP 1052, which respectively, seek to add new flexibility to ethereum's operations, facilitating scaling measures such as state channels and increasing the speed at which contracts can be verified.  Aside from these however, other proposals require careful coordination.  As reported by CoinDesk, much of the current division was aired last Friday, when developers initiated a public discussion with several representatives of the platform's key stakeholders.  While no consensus was reached, several stakeholders have since taken to social media to lay out their concerns.  In a blog post published Monday, CTO of a mining startup named Atlantic Crypto, Brian Venturo, warned that ""the security of the ethereum network is not something to compromise over."" He championed EIP 1295 as the only proposal that doesn't potentially lower security.  EIP 1295 does not reduce issuance, but rather reduces the amount of ether that is rewarded to uncles, a kind of block that speeds transactions but isn't included in the blockchain itself.  ""If you reduce the block reward you're going to price out a large proportion of hardware,"" Venturo told CoinDesk, stating that such hardware might instead become available for attacks if the reward for malicious services is higher.  While miners are pushing back against the issuance reduction, at the same time, ETH traders are pointing to the dropping market valuation of ether, stating that steps must be taken to preserve the value of the currency by limiting issuance.  In a Twitter thread that compared current bitcoin's current issuance rate to ethereum, a trader named Eric Conner remarked that if the reduction is pushed down to 2 ETH, it doesn't slip lower than bitcoin's current rate.  According to Conner, such a reduction is necessary to preserve the value of the network.  ""Fun fact! In the past 365 days, the ethereum network has paid $6.6 [billion] to miners,"" Conner tweeted.  The compromise  Adding to the criticism is that founder of ethereum Vitalik Buterin has pushed back against EIP 1295, writing on Github that it could result in the further centralization of mining pools.  ""I'm scared of this,"" Buterin wrote.  An investor and fund manager named Spencer Noon also pushed back against the proposal.  ""I'm completely unsupportive of EIP 1295 and I question the motive of its author (Atlantic Crypto Corp),"" Noon tweeted, ""ACC is a mining company run by former hedge funders. This has nothing to do with 'network security' — a block reward reduction would hurt their bottom line.""  Several Reddit posts have followed a similar tone, and in response, the mining company has retracted its current proposal in favor of arguing that the issuance reduction should remain at 3 ETH.  ""We agree that the ETH denominated issuance may be too high, but we also believe that adjusting it under the current market conditions will put undue risk on the security scale of the network,"" Venturo wrote on Github.  Speaking in a developer meeting Friday, Casper developer Danny Ryan said that a reduction to 2 ETH seems like a ""reasonable compromise"" that could balance the interests of both traders and miners. Similarly, because GPU miners are struggling to compete with ASICs, a removal of the hardware from the platform through a proof-of-work change would be another ""reasonable compromise.""  Toward this, a GPU miner and enthusiast named Kristy-Leigh Minehan is championing an code fix to be implemented in Constantinople.  Still, some feel it's unlikely it will make the cut.  ""This would be a lot more work to implement than the other EIPs,"" Michael Hahn, of ethereum wallet MyCrypto, told CoinDesk.  High stakes  All this means, there could be difficulty ahead of October. If a certain proportion of ethereum nodes chose to run different software, it could lead to a split in the network (not unlike what occurred when ethereum classic emerged following a disagreement on technical direction in 2016).  Still, there's a way in which existing ethereum code could actually help protect the network when it comes to splits.  For example, due to the presence of the difficulty bomb, an ethereum researcher named Andrew Bradley said opportunistic fork attempts without developer support are unlikely to win out.  ""It reduces the likelihood of stale chains being picked up with little effort and sustained by exchanges or precarious parties without real development support,"" Bradley told CoinDesk.  Still, the complexity Constantinope has unearthed between competing miner and trader interest has sparked a wave of community engagement in the discussion.  ""We've had a lot of community enthusiasm for the forks,"" Hudson Jameson, a communications officer for the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk, ""It's weird hearing about people watching and participating in discussion around the bi-weekly core developer calls.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, Schoedon from Parity echoed this point, stating that Constantinope is unique in that it has widened the doors of involvement when it comes to tough decisions.  ""In the past, contentious proposals were either accepted straight away or stalled forever,"" Schoedon said.  However, in this case, decisions had a wider set of stakeholder engagement, which while makes it makes the coordination process more complicated, it takes the pressure away from the core developer team.  ""Off-chain governance is difficult, and that's probably a good thing,"" Schoedon added.  And while the developers still have the last call – expected to be finalized on Friday – many stakeholders expect them to uphold the technical stability of the network above all else.  Brian Venturo told CoinDesk:  ""They understand this stuff better than everyone else and I think they're going to make the right decisions.""

Pantronics Holdings, the acquired firm, released a statement on Aug. 29 saying Huobi Group had completed the deal by purchasing about 199 million of its shares via two of the group's subsidiaries – Huobi Capital and Huobi Universal.  With that amount, Li Lin, chairman of Huobi Group and controller of the two subsidiaries, now owns 66.26 percent of Pantronics and is effectively the largest individual substantial shareholder.  The deal could further give Huobi the opportunity of a back-door listing in the future – a process where a private firm enters the secondary financial market by purchasing a major number of shares of a public company.  Based on the announcement, the transactions were made at an average price of HK$2.72 (or $0.35) per share with a total amount close to $70 million. However, the number of shares acquired appears to fall short of what the exchange intended.  As CoinDesk previously reported, in a disclosure of interests filed by Pantronics on Aug. 21, Huobi was seeking to purchase 73.73 percent of the firm's ordinary shares which would have cost a total of $77 million. Pantronics' shareholding disclosures were further amended on Aug. 28 to reflect the change.  A spokesperson for Huobi Group declined to comment on the issue and said the firm is not authorized to disclose information other than what was in the announcement.  Further, the latest document on Wednesday offered a peek into Huobi's corporate structure, such as the stakes held by notable investors of Huobi.  Based on the document, while Huobi Capital is fully owned by Li himself, Huobi Universal's largest owners include Techwealth (58.44 percent), Sequoia Capital CV IV (23.32 percent) and Zhen Partners Fund I (7.46 percent). Among them, Techwealth is an investment company, of which Li owns 89.09 percent.  Meanwhile, Sequoia Capital CV IV is a fund that's solely owned by Sequoia Capital China and Zhen Partners is a venture capital firm launched by Chinese entrepreneur Xu Xiaoping together with Sequoia Capital China.

The order, first reported earlier this week by the BBC, indicates that the agency wants to beef up its ability to monitor alternative types of transactions, including those made with cryptocurrencies. According to the publication, an improved system allowing for data about crypto wallets tied to certain individuals is being developed by Moscow Institute for Security and Information Analysis (SPI), with a price tag of roughly 195 million rubles (or about $2.8 million).  According to documents published through an electronic auction system that registers purchases and purchase requests from Russian agencies, Rosfinmonitoring should get the updated system before the end of the year.  The SPI has created other law enforcement-focused tools in the past, according to the BBC. Outside of the documents, not much is known about the scope of the initiative, and the SPI didn't respond to a request for comment.  Rosfinmonitoring declined to reveal any details about its crypto-monitoring capabilities, with its press office saying in an email that information about the system is classified.  That the agency would solicit such functionality is perhaps unsurprising, and its work could one day fit into a wider regulatory framework within Russia. As previously reported, policymakers and legislators in the country have gone back and forth on the question of cryptocurrency oversight. Last year, for example, it was reported that Rosfinmonitoring could play a possible role in monitoring transactions on regulated cryptocurrency exchanges.  Yet the criteria for how that information would be added to Rosfinmonitoring's systems isn't clear. In recent years, the number of people placed on the agency's list has been tabulated by those who have been charged over social media posts that are considered extremist or anti-religious in nature.  Right now, the list of individuals whose accounts have been blocked in Russia due to terrorism charges includes 8,600 people.
