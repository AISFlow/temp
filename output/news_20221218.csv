42394079,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXFX1,1671378600,Warren’s Reactionary Crypto Policy vs. Dorsey’s Decentralized Social Media Gambit,"Last week John J. Ray III, the new CEO of FTX who is leading the company through bankruptcy proceedings, testified before the House Financial Services Committee about the crypto exchange’s collapse. I honestly don’t think there was much to report from Ray’s testimony beyond: a) the guy knows what he’s doing and b) that he believes FTX’s downfall was really just “old-fashioned embezzlement.”  After Ray’s testimony I think most were excited to tune in to former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) scheduled testimony in front of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. But that testimony was unfortunately canceled on account of the fact that SBF was arrested in the Bahamas after U.S. authorities filed criminal charges last Monday. SBF was denied bail and awaits an extradition hearing in 2023, for which he will wait while sitting in a maggot-infested Bahamian prison.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took the opportunity, with crypto top of mind, to react with a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) called the “Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act.” I’m not going to go over the bill point by point here but, if passed, the bill will require anyone who maintains public blockchain infrastructure to register as a Financial Institution (FI). This includes software developers or anyone validating transactions on a network.  These FIs would be required to do things like collect the personal information of people who use their software and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) programs to block funds related to crime. On top of that, it would ban any interaction with privacy tools like Tornado Cash (which is sanctioned by the Treasury Department) and privacy-coin protocols including Monero or Zcash.  On its face, the bill doesn’t necessarily feel problematic, especially because it was drafted in wake of the FTX collapse. But here's the thing about the bill: It misses The Point. The Point being that a lack of corporate controls and opaque systems led to FTX’s bankruptcy, not someone like me relaying bitcoin transactions with the computer sitting in my living room.  The bill misses The Point because it goes after something only related to FTX because the word “crypto” is involved – like how soccer and baseball are related because they are both played with round-ish balls. But a rule in soccer that bans sliding into first base would be kind of … weird (non-sporty readers: There’s no first base in soccer).  Proving this, Senator Warren tweeted:  “Rogue nations, oligarchs and drug lords are using crypto to launder billions, evade sanctions and finance terrorism. My bipartisan bill puts common-sense rules in place to help close crypto money-laundering loopholes and protect our national security.”  If you are paying attention, this has almost nothing to do with FTX. To be clear, I’m not coming to the defense of FTX here. But I am coming to the defense of people like Evan Kaloudis (no relation, although I have donated to his open-source project efforts) who will have to implement a sophisticated AML program for the ZeusLN wallet he developed – a piece of software which is free and open source – if this bill becomes law. Much emphasis on “free” here.  On top of that, it is very critical to note that SBF was arrested without this bill becoming law, because he is charged with doing things – like securities fraud and wire fraud and money laundering – which are already illegal.  The hoopla around this bill comes from the fact it is primarily focused on financial surveillance, which wouldn’t have stopped FTX from happening. In fact, the bill would make non-custodial use of crypto harder, which would drive users toward the FTXs of the world – not away from them.  In all, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act is at worst a poorly veiled attempt at expanding financial surveillance, and at best it’s just a bill that misses The Point due to a lack of institutional crypto knowledge.  On decentralized social networks, funding them and The Point  Elsewhere, Twitter co-founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey donated a touch more than 14 BTC to Nostr, a decentralized social network. Some Twitter users told him he should look into it and within 24 hours Dorsey funded developer fiatjaf’s Nostr efforts.  Nostr isn’t itself a social network. Instead, it is an open protocol with a lean toward censorship resistance. The protocol doesn’t use a centralized server, instead relying on user-run clients. With this client, users can send content around by writing a post, signing it with their private key and relaying it to others’ servers. This relay network can enable others to build social media platforms using it.  I think the donation is quite cool. But probably not for the reasons you think.  You probably think I think it’s cool because ever since Twitter was taken private there has been an overwhelming sense that users are looking for a better experience and this is a step in the direction of improving that experience.  Sure, that’s cool. But what’s cooler is that the funding of this project happened organically. Nostr wasn’t the brainchild of some well-known tech billionaire; it is just a piece of open-source software that was born because, as fiatjaf told me over Telegram, “the old internet where freedom [was] winning is being killed and new, supposedly free platforms won't work in the long run.”  Whether you agree with fiatjaf or not on that point, Dorsey discovered Nostr, used it and thought it was interesting enough to warrant funding. So while it didn’t really garner attention until some well-known tech billionaire discovered it, it wasn’t that billionaire’s brainchild and that’s substantially cooler than if it was.  Fiatjaf agrees, adding over Telegram that, “money isn’t really the most impactful thing, but the fact that Jack used it and talked about it is more important.”  The parallels to Bitcoin are there (please do not take this as a suggestion that Nostr will be as big, important or successful as Bitcoin): Nostr is an open-source, decentralized protocol that people will try to use because they are dissatisfied with current systems. At a minimum, I really am looking forward to how the decentralized social media story continues to develop from here.  Tying things together  Let’s tie the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act to Dorsey’s Nostr donation.  While not targeted at all open-source developers specifically, if this bill passes then a meaningful cross-section of open-source developers may be tagged as potential criminals. So too will be the people who run and use the open-source software they develop. This tagging won’t stop everyone from using the open-source software, but it would certainly stop most people. This would in turn encourage broader use of large, custodial, centralized platforms like FTX.  And while things like Nostr wouldn’t be covered in the passing of this bill, the bill still sponsors at least a partial muzzling of open-source software, the muzzling of which is a muzzling of free speech.  In addition, with the funding of Nostr, Dorsey shows that he isn’t missing The Point.  The Point is that spectacular failures in centralized systems (like FTX) beget the need to build robust, decentralized systems that protect liberty and freedom and everyday citizens. (As corny as that sounds, it’s true.) The Point is that centralization, in this case at least, is the issue.  A natural conclusion here is that this bill would not protect us from another FTX or crypto money-laundering loopholes. It simply isn’t getting at the crux of the issue. I’m in no way suggesting that these senators are proposing this bill in bad faith; I’m only suggesting that the advertised purpose of a bill should be achievable given the laws that would be enforced in the event that the bill passes.  So in the same way that I look forward to the development of decentralized social networks, I also look forward to the development of laws that make sense in the context of what they are governing.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/18/warrens-reactionary-crypto-policy-vs-dorseys-decentralized-social-media-gambit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/970f0607a5af9b5709fa5ed84a8f6101d39be1e7-1620x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The past few weeks have seen growing fear and doubt about the asset class. However, despite the recent trend in the market, the primary crypto asset, Bitcoin, is recording an increase in whale transactions. The big shots have gathered more BTC in the past fortnight, valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plummets Below $17,000 After Audit Firm Mazars Pauses Work For Binance Bitcoin Gets Massive Whale Accumulation According to data from Santiment, a crypto analytics firm, whales have accumulated more Bitcoin tokens over the past nine days. It noted that the value of the crypto is worth over $726 million in the current market exchange rate. Santiment reported that Bitcoin’s addresses holding between 100 to 10,000 BTC tokens are still purchasing more. Furthermore, the firm mentioned that these addresses had witnessed rapid growth over the three weeks. The analytics company cited that about 159 new addresses have been holding between 100 to 10,000 BTC over the last three weeks. According to the data, this is the fastest growth such addresses have experienced in 10 months. A swing in the addresses could be linked to FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) brought about by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $16,745. Its market cap is $326.65 billion, and its dominance over altcoins is 39.64%. Whales Pick Top Stablecoins The analytics firm noted that stablecoins had also caught the whales’ interest. As a result, they are buying the top stablecoins, which include USDT, DAI, and BUSD. Santiment mentioned that the whales’ addresses that picked on Tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD) have coins worth between $100,000 and $10 million. It gave a combined purchase of about $922.4 million for the two stablecoins by the whales within the past three days. On separate records, Tether’s top addresses have accumulated a collective value of $817.5 million USDT coins. The deal represents more than a 7% surge in their holdings before December 10, 2022.

There is now increased scrutiny being placed on centralized exchanges, particularly those operating offshore, but others as well. 2022 has seen a significant decline in prices for digital assets. We believe that, in the short term, uncertainty is likely to continue as the industry tries to figure out which companies might still be impacted by the FTX/Alameda collapse. By Mirva Anttila The collapse of FTX/Alameda Research put the digital assets industry in a state of shock, and reverberations are still being felt. Although the failure of a centralized counterparty behaving badly and operating in a lightly regulated offshore environment had nothing to do with digital assets, blockchain or cryptocurrencies failing, the interdependence among crypto companies remains strong, and contagion fears still abound. In recent days, Sam Bankman-Fried ((SBF)), the ex-CEO of FTX (FTT-USD), has been giving interviews stating that he did not intend to commit fraud and denying improper use of customer funds. The fact remains, however, that an estimated $8 billion of customer funds went missing at FTX. The narrative being promoted seems to be that SBF was young, perhaps reckless, and did not quite know what was going on at his own companies. Given the severity of what happened and its massive impact on the crypto industry, we find these claims implausible, but we will leave it to the investigators to find out and judge what exactly happened. Centralized Exchanges That Show Proof of Reserves and Liabilities Will Benefit There is now increased scrutiny being placed on centralized exchanges, particularly those operating offshore, but others as well. Demands are rising that centralized exchanges should provide proof of reserves and liabilities. The assets side would indicate which coins and tokens are held by the exchange, while the liabilities side would show the investor deposits. Both sides are important. Regular full independent audits, potentially conducted unexpectedly, would assuage fears that transfers of assets could take place to cover finance gaps and improve confidence among investors. What might still be left unaccounted for are off-balance sheet liabilities, which would continue to be difficult to track. It is possible that proof of reserves and liabilities will become the norm in the industry, benefiting those companies willing to be transparent about their assets and liabilities. Many believe decentralized finance ((DEFI)) is the solution, but we believe the centralized exchanges will continue to play a significant role in the near future, as they have convenient on/off-ramps for digital assets and have established KYC 1 and AML 2 procedures in place. The Role of Insiders in Token Issuance and Trading Needs to Be Scrutinized More Fully The close connection between Solana (SOL-USD) and FTX and the rise and fall of the Solana token have led to increased scrutiny on layer 1 solutions, and questions are being asked about the viability of some of them. A particularly important area to investigate is the role of insiders in token issuance, the amount of issuance in public hands and the amount of true trading that stems from genuine usage of tokens and not from insider trading. SBF was a big proponent of the Solana network and its native token, SOL, which has dropped -95% 3 since November 2021. While part of this price turbulence is most likely related to FTX, we still see an active ecosystem around Solana. For the moment, the Ethereum blockchain continues to have the widest developer community supporting the network and a vibrant ecosystem supporting both DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), although volumes have been dismal lately. Bitcoin Miners under Pressure Another group of companies we are actively monitoring is the bitcoin miners. Some of them have been operating at a loss for a few months now, and if the bitcoin price were to drop further, many of them would be in great distress. Some bitcoin miners have high debt levels, and rising interest rates and energy costs are putting pressure on margins. Bitcoin miners using renewable energy sources might be in a better position than others to deal with high energy costs. Will Genesis Fail Too, and Will More Bitcoin Come to the Market, Depressing Prices? We are also closely following the developments at Genesis, a major crypto prime broker and trading and lending firm and a wholly owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), one of the most powerful conglomerates in the crypto industry. In November, the lending arm of Genesis suspended redemptions and new loan originations, and several of Genesis Global Trading’s creditors have hired restructuring lawyers to help prevent the bankruptcy. We have learned that Genesis owes funds to several parties, one of them being Gemini, which seeks to recover $900 million from Genesis and DCG, and another unidentified party that is also owed $900 million. 4 The finance hole, therefore, seems to amount to at least $1.8 billion. DCG has also disclosed a $2 billion intercompany debt between it and its subsidiary Genesis Global Capital. It seems that DCG currently owes $575 million to Genesis, with payment due in May 2023. We believe this loan was possibly made to fund investment opportunities and repurchase stock from shareholders at Grayscale, another DCG company. There is a potential maturity mismatch here as this loan seems to be a short-term loan; however, private investments typically take years to come to fruition. In addition, DCG has a $1.1 billion promissory note to Genesis (due in 2032) as a result of assuming Genesis’s liabilities following the Three Arrows Capital collapse earlier in 2022 and a $350 million credit facility from a group of lenders led by Eldridge. 5 Perhaps more importantly, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust currently has more than $10 billion in assets under management, and this amounts to at least 600,000 bitcoins. 6 The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) currently trades at a more than 40% discount to its net asset value. If DCG had to liquidate part of the Trust’s bitcoin, it would have a significant impact on the bitcoin price and the crypto market in general. It is estimated that DCG and its affiliates currently own approximately 10% of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. 7 Our Near-Term Outlook for the Crypto Industry 2022 has seen a significant decline in prices for digital assets. We believe that, in the short term, uncertainty is likely to continue as the industry tries to figure out which companies might still be impacted by the FTX/Alameda collapse. The greatest casualty of the recent blow-up is perhaps investor confidence, which now must be rebuilt by cleaning up opaque business practices and increasing transparency into the assets and liabilities of the crypto companies.
