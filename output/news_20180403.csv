42428792,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLe3lh,1522793049,Ethereum ASICs Are Here: What the New Miners Mean and What's Next,"ASIC-resistant no more?  That’s the question circulating Tuesday in the wake of news that Bitmain, the China-based maker of hardware specialized for cryptocurrency software, had developed a new ""ASIC"" mining chip designed specifically to process ethereum transactions and claim the protocol's rewards.  Bitmain confirmed the release of its Antminer E3 chips, which will retail for $800, in a tweet that broke what had been weeks of speculation that it would soon launch such a product, one that ran counter to statements from company officials to CoinDesk even hours before.  Still, for ethereum's developers and users, the news wasn't exactly a surprise – it had long been theorized, even in creator Vitalik Buterin’s earliest blog posts, that no algorithm for managing mining rewards would remain immune to ASICs forever.  Over time, Buterin's argument was that innovations would prevail, try as developers might to keep their code optimized for general-purpose computers.  Yet, ethereum developers have been quietly building defenses for this future, long promoting design choices intended to protect the blockchain against hardware meant to consolidate rewards in the hands of companies or individuals capable of operating at scale.  As such, some have even gone so far as to propose further changes following the day's news.  Such a step, a radical reworking of the software to render the new hardware unusable, might seem extreme if that weren't becoming the norm among cryptocurrencies. Already, monero and siacoin, two smaller cryptocurrencies, are taking steps to propose a change to its software that would effectively block efforts by Bitmain to grow its business there.  As for the impact on ethereum, however, much remains unclear at the moment.  For one, there are doubts in the ethereum community that Bitmain's mining chip is capable of significant performance increases, ones that would, say, be so pronounced they would inspire the widespread adoption of the hardware in the way bitcoin ASICs replaced hobby miners.  Further, there’s the ethereum technical roadmap, which already includes a planned shift away from proof-of-work, the system that today enables mining at all.  Indeed, Buterin has remained silent on the launch, though in his past remarks, he's mostly focused on the idea that the impact of such an innovation is likely to be short-lived.  Speaking in a developer chat in February, Buterin wrote:  ""I’m not convinced it’s worth expending resources caring too much, except to push faster on Casper.""  Poisoning the well  Stepping back, it's important to understand ethereum's mining algorithm and the platform's historical attitudes toward the practice of mining – a mechanism it has always aimed to eradicate entirely.  Prior to the launch of the platform, a method for staving off the use of mining hardware even made it into the ethereum white paper, in which developers were encouraged to seek to analyze ASICs so as to render their ability to more quickly capture protocol rewards moot.  ""Engineers can analyze existing ASICs, determine what their optimizations are, and dump transactions into the blockchain that such optimizations simply do not work with,"" Buterin wrote.  However, due to security concerns, the initial methods described were spiked. Instead, developers implemented a proof-of-work algorithm similar to the one used in bitcoin.  Named ethash, the algorithm differs from bitcoin's, though, in that rather than being suited for computationally intensive hardware like ASICs, it requires a lot of memory. This means that regardless of whether its mined on an ASIC or a GPU, both devices are necessarily encumbered by the storage requirements.  This definition is important, as it's not clear whether Bitmain's E3 ASIC has broken this fundamental aspect of ethash.  Speaking to CoinDesk, developer Nick Johnson said the ASIC doesn't seem to have achieved any improvements that would qualify it as having achieved a performance boost much higher than the GPU cards used today.  ""It looks like they're basically just making a whole pile of special-purpose GPUs with a huge amount of memory in a case,"" he told CoinDesk.  Possible response  Still, given the stakes of the shift, there are potentially more aggressive methods to pursue, the most obvious of which would be a change in the ethereum software to block Bitmain's miners.  Developer sentiment concerning such a change has been heated, if inconclusive, spurred by long-held fears among developers about the profit-seeking behaviors of miners.  In a discussion on Github, a number of potential methods for blocking Bitmain's ASICs have surfaced, ones which in the coming days are likely to calcify into a formal strategy that could help keep ethereum open to smaller miners and hobbyists.  As one user wrote on Github, citing the centralization of ethereum: ""If a hard fork can prevent them from doing so, at least until [proof-of-stake] becomes reality, then my vote is in favor of the hard fork. Brick'em.""  As the comment provides evidence, even with an ethereum protocol change coming soon to potentially abolish mining, a vocal majority of developers would also support a fork that seeks to keep barriers to entry for mining low.  That's not to say there aren't those who see the matter differently. Speaking in a blog post, Cornell researcher and ethereum enthusiast Phil Daian warned that efforts to block Bitmain's participation is akin to “censorship.”  Indeed, this mirrors past counterarguments that large-scale mining is a kind of ""co-opetition"" that, given its entrepreneurial nature, should be encouraged for the security it provides blockchains, even if it is at odds with the democratized access desired by developers.  Others aren't as convinced. Indeed, some extreme proposals for preventing ASICs have surfaced, including the possibility ethereum could go so far as to mix multiple algorithms, though these have been largely dismissed as ill-conceived.  One thing's for sure, however, tensions are high, even if formal action – or indeed even the basic facts of the situation – are still coming into focus.  According to the Bitmain site, the ethereum ASIC mines at 180 million hashes per second - less than conventional GPU miners. However, some ethereum users feel the numbers are flawed, writing on Github that the numbers have been fabricated.  Still, much won't be known until the units ship.  Said one user  :  ""Let’s keep the raw paranoia based on no actual numbers and magic under control.""

As CoinDesk previously reported, OKEx rolled back futures trades due to what it called an ""irregular"" sell-off on Friday. At the time, futures prices sharply diverged from the underlying price of bitcoin, leading to a series of liquidations and the eventual rollback, which was initiated that afternoon. At one point, the futures price dropped to as low as $4,755 after an earlier fall to around $5,200.  Yet the developments also sparked widespread criticism across social media, which included allegations that OKEx played a role in manipulating the market. In a statement published Tuesday, OKEx rebutted the claims, stating that ""we are not directly involved in the trades"" and that it undertook the rollback in an effort to protect its customers.  OKEx said:  ""We, as a trading platform, do not make profit from the price volatility, but generate income from trading fees. We have no reason to, and have never and will not, manipulate the prices of any of our market.""  In the blog, the exchange highlighted several images circulated via social media that it claimed were fake. The images, OKEx said, were used in an effort to make it seem like the exchange was engaging in manipulation.  OKEx also clarified that it put new rules in place to prevent a similar sell-off from occurring, which went into effect on March 30.

Centra's pitch to investors included the claim that it would issue a credit card, but questions quickly arose about its purported relationship with payment giant Visa. That claim would later be referenced in the SEC's complaint as well as the filings submitted by the Justice Department.

42401389,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbcgv,1522773031,Korea's Crypto Exchanges Pledge Market Cleanup,"“It was a fantastic year in 2017.”  As stated by Junhaeng Lee, co-founder and CEO of Seoul-based crypto platform Gopax, that's one simple but accurate summary of the last year for cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea. Indeed, since earlier last year, crypto trading volume in the country has surged to a point where exchanges from South Korea have topped their global peers in terms of 24-hour trading volume.  Speaking at the Deconomy conference in Seoul on Tuesday, Lee credited the speculative mindset of Korean investors as the key driver. As he put it, when price surged, investors simply flocked in, enticed by big gains.cl  ""South Korea market is very, very speculative,"" he told CoinDesk.  Yet, that boom has proved transient.  Amid tighter regulatory measures on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and increased scrutiny from financial watchdogs, the domestic cryptocurrency market has seen what appears to be its largest-ever correction. While the total capitalization of all cryptos have seen its all-time high at a whopping $800 billion near the end of last year, it plunged to just below $300 billion within three months in 2018.  Still at this week's event, one of the largest yet held in the country, those assembled sought to argue that the development was best seen as a ""healthy correction,"" with representatives from Korean exchanges – including Gopax, Coinone and Korbit – showing optimism during onstage sessions that saw them discuss how to ensure a healthier market.  However, most notably, each exchange said that it will take steps to better their efforts in standardizing practices.    Korbit CEO Tony Lyu told the audience:  ""We need to create a healthy market first. If exchanges can’t do that on our own, we will have to turn to the government.""  ICO ban  Still, there was also a willingness by those onstage to support some of the more highly criticized practices in the industry, including the issuing of custom cryptocurrencies by startups for fundraising.  As reported by CoinDesk, South Korea‘s regulator Financial Services Commission issued a guideline on Sept. 29 last year to prohibit all forms of ICO domestically. Yet, fundraisers from both Korea and abroad appear not to be not deterred in soliciting Korean investors.  “Many ICOs are still looking for interests in South Korea – with operators from the country but registration in overseas – and wishing to list their tokens in Korean exchanges,” Gopax's Lee remarked.  Adding to a broader dynamics, Myunghun Cha, CEO of Coinone, said during the panel that the firm has come frequently across requests where projects pitched in with payment offer for the exchange to list their tokens.  In light of that, exchange operators in the country are doubling down on their efforts in reining this speculation drive through more robust vetting methods.  In explaining that, Lee said his firm has established a token review committee with lawyers to have project teams come to its office to verify their technological background and whether the platform design is even feasible.  “There are just too many projects every day and we have to be more conservative on ICOs as investors cannot have enough information so we need to do a lot of filtering for them,” Cha said.  Echoing that, Lyu voiced an even higher level of concern moving forward on listing tokens from ICOs, which will largely be in line with the exchange’s existing offering that limits to trading pairs to more mainstream cryptos such as bitcoin, ether and ripple.  KYC Mandate  Aside from a more robust vetting system to screen tokens or a more conservative strategy, Korbit refrains from listing ICO tokens, the mandate of know-your-customer verification process is another area that exchanges will see further self-compliance with the regulator.  As reported before, starting from February this year, the FSC has formally banned domestic banks in South Korea from offering virtual accounts for exchanges in a bid to mandate stricter user ID verification process.  In speaking to CoinDesk, Cha said so far Coinone has seen a roughly 20 to 30 percent of its users that have completed the mandate since the exchange currently can only proceed with one bank in South Korea.  Meanwhile, the Shinhan bank-invested Gopax told CoinDesk it has had all users on the platform to complete the process in bid to fully comply with the regulation imposed by the FSC.  To that effort, Lyu from Korbit argues that a better collaboration with financial institutions is imperative, otherwise the industry may see further government weighing-in.

The Antminer E3 is set to ship this July, according to Bitmain's website, at a price of $800 per unit. According to statements, the company is limiting orders to ""one unit per user"" with restrictions on shipping to China and Taiwan.  As was perhaps expected, the listing quickly drew interest from would-be buyers. As of press time, the website indicates that the first batch has already sold out.  Hints about Bitmain's ethereum mining product first emerged in February, when China-based news site Technews.cn published details about the expected hardware.  And late last month, CNBC cited Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland, who told the firm's clients that a forthcoming ethereum-focused application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) would dampen the prospects for graphics card makers AMD and Nvidia, whose products have been in high demand by the world's cryptocurrency miners.  ""During our travels through Asia last week, we confirmed that Bitmain has already developed an ASIC [application-specific integrated circuit] for mining Ethereum, and is readying the supply chain for shipments in [Q2 2018],"" Rolland reportedly wrote.  However, it remains to be seen whether the ethereum ecosystem will take steps to block the use of the forthcoming ASIC through protocol changes.

42401388,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbcex,1522764916,Down 50%: Q1 Was Bitcoin's Second Worst Quarter Ever,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 50 percent in the first three months of 2018 – a drop that marks the cryptocurrency's worst Q1 performance on record.  A look back at historical Bitcoin Price Index data shows that the halving in value seen this year is the second-worst quarterly performance ever. The cryptocurrency suffered its all-time biggest quarterly drop in the third quarter of 2011, when it fell 68 percent from $16.1 to $5.14.  Interestingly, the table clearly shows that, since 2013, bitcoin has rarely seen gains over the first quarter of the year.  The magnitude of the decline in 2018 should not come as a surprise, given the cryptocurrency witnessed an unprecedented rally to a record high of around $20,000 in late 2017.  January: Healthy pullback takes a turn for the worst  At the start of 2018, BTC had already fallen close to 44 percent from lifetime highs in the previous month, but, by the second week of January, the cryptocurrency had scaled $17,000, reviving hopes of a rally to fresh record highs.  However, fears of stricter regulations in South Korea and China helped push prices below the $10,000 mark on Jan. 17. Facebook banning crypto ads on Jan. 30 added fuel to the fire.  February: V-shaped recovery gathers pace  The sell-off continued in the subsequent weeks, pushing prices as low as $6,000 on Feb. 5. Bitcoin's ""long-tailed"" candle on Feb. 6 was followed by a sharp rally to $11,700 by Feb. 20.  Once again, the price surge raised hopes of a rally to record highs, but the move ran out of steam around the key descending trendline resistance and established $11,700 as a key resistance on the technical charts.  March: BTC takes a beating, 'death cross' fears grow  Bitcoin fell by more than 30 percent after the bulls failed to beat the trendline resistance in early March. The news flow continued to be anything but positive, as technology giants Google and Twitter also banned cryptocurrency ads. By the end of March, BTC was back down below $7,000.  Chart experts took note of the possible ""death cross"" (a bearish crossover between the 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average) – an ominous signal that was supposed to yield a drop to levels last seen in August 2017. The death cross was confirmed on March 30, but has not had a negative impact on BTC, possibly due to oversold conditions as represented by the daily relative strength index.  Conclusion  It is worth noting that over the last 10 weeks, the correlation between the stock markets and bitcoin has strengthened, which indicates BTC is still being perceived as a risk asset as opposed to a safe-haven asset like gold.  Furthermore, the ""Kimchi premium"" – the spread or difference between bitcoin prices on Korean exchanges and prices on western exchanges – fell sharply in the first quarter, signaling that the markets have normalized following regulatory changes in the country.

42401397,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbcmp,1522760727,Liechtenstein to Avoid 'Excessive' Blockchain Regulation: Prime Minister,"Blockchain technology is driving economic transformation and Liechtenstein wants to be in the front seat, according to the country's prime minister.  As such, the Liechtenstein government has set out to draw up ""sensible,"" comprehensive blockchain legislation to create a legal environment that's conducive to innovation and light on regulation.  While other nations have steadily introduced blockchain and cryptocurrency-related laws, Prime Minister Adrian Hasler told CoinDesk that Liechtenstein's forthcoming bill ""goes much further than the blockchain legislation of other countries.""  ""The law is intended to regulate all activities that are possible on technical systems such as distributed ledgers and blockchain systems, and thus provide legal certainty,"" Hasler said. ""But the law covers much more than merely the issuing of cryptocurrencies and utility tokens. The law is intended to provide the necessary legal framework for a wide range of new services and business models relating to these technologies.""  Hasler indicated that the bill, dubbed ""The Blockchain Act,"" will outline a careful, light-handed regulatory framework.  The prime minister explained:  ""There is no point in creating regulations that are excessive and lacking in practical relevance, because then the blockchain economy will simply develop outside the regulations. That surely would not be in the interest of any country. Therefore we want to propose a sensible regulatory approach by means of this law, where the role of the state in creating legal certainty and confidence comes into effect where it is needed.""  The bill will be primarily informed by Liechtenstein's Financial Market Supervisory Authority, which has so-far addressed over 100 blockchain and cryptocurrency-related enquiries.  'Significant change'  Hasler further noted that the government has reviewed the legislation of other countries, and is also in consultation with variety of fintech companies, financial service providers and lawyers, with the aim of making the bill ""as relevant in practice as possible."" He expects to present the bill to the public this summer.  While the timing of the legislation coincides with an industry boom, Hasler said Liechtenstein's interest in the blockchain is not new, and the bill follows an analysis of ""the opportunities and risks of a blockchain economy"" by a working group that convened about one-and-a-half years ago.  Hasler told CoinDesk:  ""It quickly became clear how the blockchain can significantly change almost all aspects of our economic life and financial services.""  Likewise, Hasler attributed the timing of The Blockchain Act to a broader attempt at ""state innovation.""  ""For the Liechtenstein government, it is important that the state and the authorities are themselves in a position to develop further,"" he explained. ""The Blockchain Act stems from this process of innovation.""  The small European country, which has a population of less than 40,000, has thus far demonstrated a growing appetite for blockchain and cryptocurrency technology.  In March, Crown Prince Alois Philipp Maria revealed that the royal family is considering investing some of its $5 billion fortune in cryptocurrencies, and suggested that the blockchain could be used to increase the efficacy of the government.  And, an early mover in its industry, Liechtenstein's Bank Frick also announced in March that it now allows clients to invest directly in cryptocurrencies, citing demand from companies across Europe as the catalyst for its decision.

42401401,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbcsj,1522756828,Don't Forget the 'Other' Cryptocurrency Tax,"David Deputy is the director of strategic development and emerging markets and George Salis is a principal senior tax economist at Vertex, a tax software firm.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      Therefore, whenever taxation of cryptocurrency is discussed, it's almost always about taxing changes in realized wealth, i.e. income tax.  But that could soon change.  As we weather the great crypto winter of 2018, many believe the space could emerge stronger than before, as regulators grow more comfortable with the risks and become more committed to global cooperation on the issues. With concurrent work by core developers pushing scalability and fee-reducing upgrades into the tech stacks, cryptos may finally be poised to begin gaining acceptance as a means of exchange and a unit of account – in other words, ready for use in daily transactions.  While certainly a long-anticipated and welcome milestone, it’s also sure to raise the ire of national and state regulators hungry for revenue – revenue from sales taxes, value-added taxes (VAT) and goods and services taxes (GST). On a global basis, these taxes raise more revenue for governments than income tax.  As with income taxes, failure to comply can lead to dramatic consequences for those who are unaware or fail to follow regulations. And these taxes can bite, with Finland charging 24 percent, France 20 percent and Germany 19 percent.  So, how do we start the conversation, and what do businesses, decentralized or otherwise, need to know? What about issuing or holding tokens: how does the classification of the token determine which taxes apply? With many token issuers hoping (or perhaps praying) for a ""utility"" rather than security classification, does a utility designation result in transaction tax liability and if so where?  Unfortunately, it not an easy picture to paint. Just as there is a lack of consistency and global uniformity when it comes to securities regulations for cryptocurrencies, the same byzantine quilt of regulatory morass exists for transaction tax regulations.  Here are three cryptocurrency transaction tax trends that businesses, and to some extent individuals, need to be aware of.  Different countries, different rules  As in nearly every other aspect of tax, different countries have different regulations and guidelines. If your company does business in more than one country, this can be nearly impossible to manage without a full-time staff of experts or advisors.  In cases where goods or services are purchased using crypto, and the crypto is considered an asset or property, first the gain is computed as income subject to tax for the purchaser, then the total value of the transaction is subject to transaction tax, which the merchant/seller/vendor must then collect and remit.  This is all calculated in local fiat currency converted with the appropriate timing. Individual nations (and even some states within countries like the U.S.) impose their own set of tax rates and often their own definitions for the different categories of goods and services.  In several countries there are multiple layers of taxation: think city, state, and federal, all at the same time but with different rates. In short, it’s a real mess for small businesses going global.  But wait, there’s more! If you thought calculating rates was difficult, determining which jurisdictions have the right to tax is even more complicated.  In a typical transaction, there’s a relatively complex set of required factual determinations involving “bill to,” “ship to,” “ship from” and “consumer resident jurisdiction.” Of course, exactly how these facts apply varies by jurisdiction.  The taxman goes online  With digital goods, which most emerging crypto tokens presently represent, the rules have only just started to emerge in the last few years.  These rules are in constant flux, with efforts by the EU and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) hot and heavy as we write this (search ""OECD BEPS Action 1 interim report"" for 300 pages of recently published, potentially mind-numbing details).  The clear trend points toward taxing digital transactions (no more tax-free internet). Taxing is based upon where the consumer resides. Collection is done via holding platforms collecting and remitting on merchants' behalf and/or the withholding of taxes on payments sent to offshore merchants.  So it’s complicated. In the crypto space, should we care?  One can argue that today the pseudonymous nature of crypto means little is typically known about the sender or receiver of a transaction. Consequently, all these new “digital economy” rules simply cannot be enforced.  However, with government tax and other administrators leaning on the exchanges to introduce know-your-client (KYC) guidelines, and then requesting these records, unidentified accounts may dwindle over time. Further, we may also eventually expect some type of global default rule requiring crypto-based businesses to accumulate and then distribute these taxes based upon some kind of allocation to jurisdictions.  Think about a set of “white blockchains” emerging which enforce tax, securities, AML/KYC and other rules. These would be in-demand platforms as businesses and investors seek to de-risk their crypto space operations.  Taxing the intermediary  The third trend relates to who is responsible for paying a tax.  The digital economy (by which we mean just the internet, not yet the blockchain) arose far faster than regulators were prepared for. So now, they are struggling to find a way to tax transactions that present a rapid erosion to their transaction tax base.  One emerging idea is to make intermediaries, such as Amazon and Alibaba, responsible for tax collection. This is not yet a widely accepted solution, but discussions within the OECD and the EU are occurring, and the U.S. has legislative and judicial actions already pending.  If this method were to catch on, it may be easy to see a distributed blockchain-based business, or even the underlying distributed blockchain itself, as an intermediary that is responsible for collection of transaction taxes.  This much is clear: Given the projected revenue loss from internet transactions, governments are not delaying.  Australia, India, Singapore, the U.K. and others are introducing regulations to tax digital transactions that take place within their borders. Regulators are unlikely to view blockchain-based transactions as anything other than a new form of digital-economy “internet” transaction for which they are launching rules today.  Tokens for taxable goods or services  Further, depending on the country, any companies or individuals, having issued tokens redeemable for goods or services, should consider both their corporate tax risk and the peril to their individual freedom.  First we have to acknowledge that this is a fuzzy area, given that the basic concept of what a token represents is still unclear. Governments are struggling to draw bright lines between what is a security or property or an asset or a commodity or something with utility (prepaid goods or services). The ability for a token to morph over time further complicates the matter as we have seen with the shifting fortunes of the SAFT approach.  But complexity and lack of expertise is not often a valid or effective defense – just do a quick search under the term “dawn tax raid” and you will see first-hand the cold, hard reality of misinterpreting or ignorance of tax rules.  Pay special attention to South Korea, both a crypto hot-spot and the jurisdiction most active in “dawn raids.” Further, our Korean friends have an interesting law, whereby a business alone cannot be indicted as a natural person – a human must also be charged.  Consequently, beware of that early morning knock on your hotel door when you attend that conference in Seoul. As usual, caveat emptor.

According to Nikkei sources, Monex – an online brokerage firm also based in japan – is considering buying a majority stake in the exchange. Under the possible deal, Monex would reportedly replace the management team and rebuild the Coincheck platform itself.  If it goes ahead, the deal could be worth ""several billion yen"" and could be announced this week, Nikkei adds.  However, the acquisition has still not been officially confirmed by the broker, and a report from Reuters states that, when contacted for confirmation of the news, Coincheck said that it hadn’t released information on any deal.  Following the report, Monex shares shot up by 23 percent, the maximum permitted by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Nikkei says.  Coincheck found itself in deep water with both customers and regulators following the hack of about $530 million-worth of cryptocurrency that occurred in late January.  Since then, it has faced investigations from Japan's Financial Services Agency over security failures and its ability to repay users that lost funds in the heist.  Coincheck has pledged to reimburse users at a rate of $0.81 per token – which would result in a total payout near $420 million.

42401403,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbcti,1522749649,"Acid Test: Bitcoin Must Break $7,800 for Bull Reversal","Bitcoin (BTC) continues to mount a recovery despite the recent bearish ""death cross"" chart event.  As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,400 on Bitfinex and the average price on leading exchanges, as represented by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, is seen at $7,380.  The cryptocurrency's 15-percent rally from the 54-day low of $6,425 set on April 1 is encouraging and pretty much in line with the historical relative strength index (RSI) pattern.  That said, the bulls' job is only half done, and bitcoin is still stuck in a falling channel. So, a clear break above $7,800 is now needed to confirm a bullish trend reversal and avert another sell-off.  Daily chart  A daily close (as per UTC) above the falling channel resistance would signal a short-term bullish trend reversal – i.e. the sell-off from the March 5 high of $11,700 has ended and would allow a test of supply around the bigger descending trendline sloping downwards from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high.  Note, the falling channel resistance is lined up at $7,900 and is seen sloping downwards to $7,800 by tomorrow. A move above that level would lift the RSI above the descending trendline, thus bringing in more technical buyers into the market.  The 4-hour chart below shows scope for a rally to $7,800–$7,900 over the next 24–48 hours.  4-hour chart  The bullish RSI divergence followed by a break above the minor descending trendline indicate that bitcoin could rally by another 400 dollars or so. The RSI is also above 50.00 (in the bullish territory) and is trending.  However, if BTC repeatedly fails to take out the falling channel hurdle (seen in the daily chart) in the next couple of days, then the bears may flex their muscle. Moreover, that would mean the recent gains are nothing more than a corrective rally. The ensuing sell-off could take BTC down to $6,000 (November lows).  As a result, the falling channel resistance presents a sort of acid test for the bitcoin market.  In the larger scheme of things, a bullish reversal is seen only above $11,700 as shown by the long duration chart below.  Weekly chart  BTC has defended the 50-week moving average (MA), yet the outlook remains bearish as suggested by the descending 5-week MA and 10-week MA. Furthermore, the RSI is bearish. Only a move above $11,700 (bearish outside-week candle high) would revive the bullish outlook and potentially yield rally to fresh record highs.  View  BTC could test the falling channel resistance in the next 24–48 hours (currently seen at $7,900, will be at $7,800 tomorrow).  A daily close above the channel resistance would signal short-term bull reversal and expose resistance lined up at $8,090 (5-week MA) and $9,177 (March 21 high).  Repeated failure to beat the channel hurdle could yield a re-test of $6,425 (April 1 low).  Disclaimer: This article is not intended to provide investment advice.

42401390,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbchu,1522745732,New AML Rules for Australia's Bitcoin Exchanges Kick In Today,"Australia’s cryptocurrency exchanges must now follow new rules aimed to counter money laundering and terrorism financing (AML/CTF).  Providing a timely reminder to exchange platforms in the crypto space, Austrac, the country's financial intelligence agency, has just published a new web page setting out their new obligations as of April 3.  Going forward, exchanges must meet new obligations, which include: registering with the agency, adopting and maintaining an AML/CTF program, identifying and verifying users, and  reporting suspicious behaviour and transactions involving fiat currency of A$10,000 (US$7,700) and over. They must also maintain records for seven years.  While offering exchange services without being registered can now bring criminal charges and penalties, Austrac says in the post:  ""A ‘policy principles’ period of six months will be in place from 3 April 2018. During that period, the AUSTRAC CEO can only take enforcement action if [a cryptocurrency exchange] fails to take ‘reasonable steps’ to comply.""  And, while exchanges' registration applications are being considered, a transitional arrangement will allow existing firms to continue providing services, however they must to register by May 14.  Aimed to counter illicit uses of cryptocurrencies, the new regulations were first set in law when the Australian Senate approved the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2017 in early December 2017. The bill also gave Austrac oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges.  That bill was the second notable piece of legislation to be passed in Australian last year. Another bill, passed in October 2017, ended the long-controversial ""double taxation"" of cryptocurrencies. Previously, cryptos were taxed first upon purchase, then effectively again when buying items subject to the tax – a situation that arose from a previous 2014 law that treated cryptocurrencies as bartered goods for goods and services tax (GST) purposes.  With the passing of the bill, as of July 1, 2018, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will get the same GST treatment as foreign currencies.

42401396,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbclq,1522742444,Lightning Is Being Attacked for Its Own Good,"""Yes, we have created an attack framework for the lightning network.""  The message from ""bitPico"" to CoinDesk confirmed what many had read in a popular chat group, that the pseudonymous user was flooding nodes running the software with traffic with an automated ""attack toolkit.""  Around the same time, a handful of developers reported lightning nodes crashing, temporarily stopping them from sending payments using the technology designed for faster, cheaper bitcoin transactions.  The development comes as more and more users have started using lightning network to send real payments – albeit with some bumps along the way – and just a couple weeks after Lightning Labs, one of several startups building open-source lightning implementations, was the first to launch its product into live beta.  The attacks were a strange incident in that user funds were safe and money wasn't being stolen. In fact, those, including bitPico, who are attacking the network might even be losing money.  One of the first to notice the attacks, Bitrefill developer Justin Camarena, was able to fix his company's node – and easily.  But he was confused as to why anyone would attack other lightning nodes without the lure of monetary gain. He wondered why they wouldn't just report any issues on GitHub, so developers could fix any bugs found.  ""[It] wasn't really an attack to steal funds, but to make a statement in my opinion,"" Camarena told CoinDesk.  At first, many had the same impression, since bitPico had been a vocal supporter of a controversial scaling initiative, and had continued to espouse the benefits of increasing the block size parameter, even after most network participants ditched the effort.  But, according to bitPico, the attacks aren't just more politics; they're all about safety:  ""As people with investment into bitcoin, we want to make sure layer-two solutions do not get [zero-day’ed] out of the gate; trying as many attacks as possible is the only way to make sure.""  Zero-day vulnerabilities are security holes that aren't known to developers of a project. Usually, they are exploited by hackers in the hopes of stealing data before the vulnerability is patched.  But bitPico's attacks, which started about 10 days ago, are all about stress-testing the software before more people start using it. And bitPico's plan seems to be working – to a degree.  According to bitPico, 22 different attack vectors have been found, and the pseudonymous user plans to continue the attacks for another couple of weeks.  A common annoyance  It's worth pointing out that denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are common across the internet.  These attacks simply drown a server with so much traffic that they crash under the load. And because these are a common practice among attackers, websites will generally develop armor to protect against them.  Indeed, bitPico's attacks are prompting lightning developers to do just that, putting forward various possible fixes. And many developers believe these current attacks will set the lightning network up for success.  For instance, bitcoin advocate and author Andreas Antonopoulos blithely called the attacks ""free testing,"" while some developers just laughed them off.  ""Frankly that's to be expected for any service that is exposed to the internet and [it] doesn't qualify as a real attack in my view,"" said Pierre-Marie Padiou, CEO of ACINQ, a French startup behind another lightning client.  Developer Alex Bosworth has started using firewall software, called iptables, to prevent this traffic from disrupting legitimate transactions.  But the attacks are ongoing, propagated by users like bitPico opening tiny payment channels – which they have to pay a fee for opening. (This is one way attackers are probably losing money in DoSing the network – though it costs less than a penny to do so.)  This is a problem in that the Lightning Labs client, for one, doesn't yet allow nodes to disconnect from these spammy channels, thus slowing them down.  In the future, Bosworth hopes the Lightning Labs implementation will allow users to disconnect from suspect peers.  Still, the attacks are merely what Bosworth and Camerena call an ""annoyance."" ""They wasted their fee to make that channel. It's just bugging me,"" Bosworth said.  Accidents, not attacks  All this goes to show that while the lightning network is ready for real money for the first time – a big step, to be sure – there's still a number of smaller issues that need to be resolved before it will be ready for everyday, non-technical users.  This was on full display in another scenario recently: what developers initially thought was an attack, then turned out to be a simple mistake.  A little over a week ago, Bosworth tweeted that an ""attacker"" has broadcast an old ""channel state,"" which could have allowed the user to effectively steal another user's funds.  Toward that, Bosworth tweeted, ""Lightning DoSers seem organized and motivated.""  But the network's rules worked as programmed, penalizing the user $25-worth of bitcoin instead.  ""Justice has been served,"" Camarena tweeted at the time, after seeing the message the program spits out when a bad actor tries to steal money by broadcasting an old transaction.  ""That is exactly how it should respond. That was pretty interesting to see it play out for real,"" Bosworth told CoinDesk.  Yet, while the revocation process worked, it also displayed that there are still more tweaks needed, as the software shouldn't have let the user send old data in the first place.  As it turned out, broadcasting the old data was an accident on the part of a user with a corrupted channel database, who restored an old backup and closed his channels. When the channels were closed, the old channel states were broadcast and the node he was connected to detected it and categorized it as fraud.  Nonetheless, lightning developers see these errors as good learning experiences that will ultimately bring about a tougher network.  As Bosworth tweeted:  ""We're getting a good opportunity to develop robust [peer-to-peer] deployment strategies.""

42401402,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbcrk,1522728018,How Active Crypto Traders Can Save on US Taxes,"Robert A. Green is a CPA and managing member of Green, Neuschwander & Manning, LLC in Connecticut.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto & Taxes 2018 series.      A number of cryptocurrency traders in the U.S. are facing a tax trap.  They had massive capital gains in 2017 and have not yet paid the IRS or the state their 2017 taxes owed. However, in the first quarter of this year, their cryptocurrency portfolios significantly declined in value, and they incurred substantial trading losses.  Now, they need to sell cryptocurrencies to raise cash to pay their 2017 tax liabilities due by April 17.  That would leave many of them with little cryptocurrency to continue trading. Of course, they may choose to file their automatic extensions without tax payment or a small payment and incur a late-payment penalty of 0.5 percent per month by the extension due date of Oct. 15. (Make sure to file your return or extension by April 17. If you miss the deadline, the IRS charges a late-filing penalty of 5 percent of the amount due for each month or part of a month your return is late. The maximum penalty is 25 percent.)  If so, they’d be banking on coin prices increasing and thereby generating trading gains by Oct. 15. (It reminds me of trading on margin, except unlike a bank, the tax authorities cannot force a sale now.)The tax trap can get worse: Many cryptocurrency traders might have substantial capital losses in 2018 and get stuck with the $3,000 capital loss limitation against other income. Many will feel it's unfair to pay massive capital gains taxes for 2017 without the ability to get immediate tax relief for new losses.  Fortunately, there are a number of safer strategies traders can use to cut their tax bill, which I outline below.  Trader tax status  For starters, active cryptocurrency traders can qualify for trader tax status (TTS) to deduct trading business and home office expenses.  TTS is essential in 2018. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in December, suspended investment expenses and the IRS does not permit employee benefit plan deductions on investment income.  A TTS trader can write off health insurance premiums and retirement plan contributions by trading through an S-Corp with officer compensation.  Section 475  There’s a potential additional tax benefit with TTS: Electing Section 475 mark-to-market accounting (MTM) on securities and/or commodities. But for crypto traders, I have to stress the word “potential.”  Section 475 turns capital gains and losses into ordinary gains and losses, thereby avoiding the $3,000 capital loss limitation and wash-sale loss adjustments on securities (this is what I like to call ""tax-loss insurance""). Ordinary losses offset income of any kind, which makes them more useful than capital losses.  As I mentioned, many crypto traders incurred substantial trading losses in the first quarter of 2018, and they would prefer ordinary loss treatment to offset wages and other income. Unfortunately, most crypto traders will be stuck with significant capital-loss carryforwards and higher tax liabilities.  There are benefits to 475 income, too. The new tax law ushered in a 20% pass-through deduction on qualified business income (Section 199A), which likely includes Section 475 ordinary income, but excludes capital gains.  Trading is a specified service activity, requiring the owner to have taxable income under a threshold of $315,000 (married) or $157,500 (other taxpayers). There is a phase-out range above the limit of $100,000 (married) and $50,000 (other taxpayers). A wage limitation also applies in the phase-out range.  But again I emphasize that 475 is not guaranteed to help crypto traders.  The IRS weighs in….  Stepping back, in March 2014, the IRS issued long-awaited guidance declaring cryptocurrency ""intangible property,"" before regulators thoroughly assessed the sector. Section 475 is for securities and commodities and does not mention intangible property.  Over a year ago, an AICPA task force on virtual currency asked the IRS for further guidance, including if coin traders could use Section 475. The IRS has not yet replied.  For the basic tax rules: An investor who holds cryptocurrencies as a capital asset should report short-term and long-term capital gains and losses on Form 8949, using the realization method.  ...And so do the SEC and CFTC  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently stated initial coin offerings (ICOs) might be securities offerings, which most likely need to register with the SEC. It further said cryptocurrencies or tokens might be securities, even if the ICO calls them something else.  According to the regulator, “If a platform offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an ‘exchange,’ as defined by the federal securities laws, then the platform must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration.”  Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) defined cryptocurrencies as commodities in 2015.  More recently, during a March 2018 CNBC interview, Commissioner Brian Quintenz said the CFTC has enforcement authority, but not oversight authority, over cryptocurrencies traded in the spot market on coin exchanges. The CFTC also has enforcement and oversight authority for derivatives traded on commodities exchanges, such as bitcoin futures.  Also in March, a U.S. district judge in New York ruled in favor of the CFTC, stating “virtual currencies can be regulated by CFTC as a commodity.”  Will the IRS change its mind?  Against that backdrop, there is a long-shot possibility the IRS could change its tune to treat cryptocurrency as a security or a commodity.  That might then fit cryptocurrency into the definition of securities or commodities in Section 475. Might. Until and unless the IRS updates its guidance, however, cryptocurrency is intangible property, which is not listed in Section 475.  The IRS has a significant workload drafting regulations to implement the new tax law, and given its limited resources, I don’t expect the agency to update its cryptocurrency guidance anytime soon.  Nevertheless, if you incurred substantial trading losses in cryptocurrencies in the first quarter, and you qualify for TTS, you might want to consider making a protective 2018 Section 475 election on securities and commodities by April 17. Even if the IRS decides to stick with its definition of crypto as intangible property, you won’t be penalized, since a protective election is provisional.  In the worst case, the election will be declared null and void. Crypto traders won’t be using Section 475 ordinary gains or loss treatment until filing 2018 tax returns in 2019. That allows one year or more for the IRS to reply to the AICPA task force. If the IRS does not permit crypto traders to use Section 475, then use capital gains and loss treatment, instead.  For the crypto traders I described at the beginning of the article, a Section 475 election would not be a savior. It turns 2018 capital losses into ordinary losses on TTS positions, but the IRS no longer allows net operating loss (NOL) carryback refunds. In prior years, a trader with this problem could hold the IRS at bay, promising to file an NOL carryback refund claim to offset taxes owed for 2017.  There is a side effect of making a 475 election on commodities: If you also trade Section 1256 contracts, you surrender the lower 60/40 capital gains rates, under which 60 percent (including day trades) are taxed at the lower, long-term capital gains rate, and 40 percent are taxed at the higher short-term rate, which is the ordinary tax rate.  Perhaps you only trade cryptocurrency and don’t care about Section 1256 contracts. If crypto is deemed a commodity for tax purposes, it’s still likely not a Section 1256 contract unless it lists on a CFTC-registered qualified board of exchange (QBE). Cryptocurrency exchanges are currently not QBEs.  Section 475 provides for the proper segregation of investment positions on a contemporaneous basis, which means when you buy the position. If you have a substantial loss in a cryptocurrency that you’ve held onto for months before the sale, the IRS will likely consider it a capital loss on an investment position.  How to qualify for TTS  Unsure if you are eligible for TTS? Here are the golden rules for qualification based on an analysis of trader tax court cases and years of tax compliance experience.  Volume: Three to four trades per day. Don’t count the times when a cryptocurrency exchange breaks down an order into multiple executions.  Frequency: Trade executions on 75 percent of available trading days. If you trade five days per week, you should have trade orders executed on close to four days per week.  Holding period: In a 2013 case, the U.S. Tax Court required an average holding period of fewer than 31 days.  Hours: At least four hours per day, including on research and administration.  Taxable account size: Material to net worth, and at least $15,000 during the year.  Intention to make a primary or supplemental living: You can have another job or business, too.  Operations: One or more trading computers with multiple monitors and a dedicated home office.  Automation: You can count the volume and frequency of a self-created automated trading system, algorithms or bots. If you license the automation from another party, it doesn’t count.  A trade copying service, using outside investment managers and retirement plan accounts, doesn’t count for TTS.  If you qualify for TTS, claim it by using business expense treatment rather than investment expenses. TTS does not require an election, but 475 does.  Deja vu  In 1997, Congress recognized the growth of online trading when it expanded Section 475 from dealers to traders in securities and commodities. I was urging clients and followers in chat rooms to elect 475 for free tax-loss insurance.  When the tech bubble burst in 2000, those who followed my advice were happy to get significant tax refunds on their ordinary business losses with NOL carrybacks.  I wish Section 475 were openly available to all TTS crypto traders now.  Darren Neuschwander CPA contributed to this blog post.

42401393,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbcit,1522722620,Report: 9 Cryptocurrency Hedge Funds Have Closed in 2018,"At least nine cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds were shuttered in the first three months of 2018, Bloomberg reported Monday.  The closures include the Crowd Crypto Fund and Alpha Protocol, the news service reported. While Crowd Crypto Fund shut down all of its digital platforms, including its social media presence, Alpha Protocol simply announced it was refunding its investors all of their funds. According to the fund's website, the refunds were completed on March 31.  Even hedge funds that are more firmly established have seen decreased interest from investors. Bloomberg cited as an example Multicoin Capital, whose co-founder, Kyle Samani, told the news organization that ""new capital has slowed, even for a higher-profile fund like ours.""  The news comes amid a broader decline in the returns these funds receive, the news organization said. Cryptocurrency hedge funds are seeing their returns drop an average of 23 percent, a figure which is not helped by a bear market which brought token prices down to some of the lowest levels since last year.  Indeed, only two of the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap saw gains in the first quarter of 2018, as previously reported. The overall market capitalization fell from $830 billion in early January to $251 billion last week.  Bloomberg noted that more than 200 cryptocurrency-related hedge funds have launched over the last several years. The article quoted Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research LLP, as predicting that roughly 10 percent of these will shut down by January 2019.
