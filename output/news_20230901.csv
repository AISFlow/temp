16894951,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549741,1693609245,On-chain Sleuth Potentially Unveils Shiba Inu Founder With Shocking Affiliates,"The identity of the mind behind the Shiba Inu meme coin has been a long-standing crypto mystery since it first debuted in 2020. So far, there has been no concrete proof as to who it might be with guesses ranging from FTX‚Äôs Sam Bankman-Fried to Ethereum‚Äôs Vitalik Buterin. Despite having little success so far, crypto investigators have not given up as a new theory has popped up as to the creator behind Shiba Inu. Has The Shiba Inu Founder Been Identified? An X (formerly Twitter) user identified by the username @boringsleuth first drew attention on Thursday, August 1, after they posted an elaborate theory as to who the founder of Shiba Inu is. In this initial thread, the researcher put forward that there was not one but two founders behind the coin. Related Reading: Grayscale Victory Sends Bitcoin Open Interest Surging After Hitting One-Year Lows Two names were put forward ‚Äì Ryo Suzuki & Tsuyoshi Maruyama, a combination of which the researcher believes was used to make the widely known Ryoshi moniker. Interestingly, both of the people named were identified to be advisors of B2C2, a liquidity provider. This is where the investigator makes the connection to Shiba Inu. According to Boring Sleugh, the liquidity provider‚Äôs wallet once held 25% of the total SHIB supply in its wallet. Furthermore, they linked the two alleged founders together by pointing out that Tsuyoshi Maruyama had immediately taken over as an advisor for B2C2 when Ryo Suzuki stepped down from the role in 2021. A follow-up post from the researcher digs deeper into Suzuki‚Äôs past, tying him to an internship at Microsoft when SHIB was launched, as well as a visit to the infamous MIT media lab in 2019. Wait until I show you that Ryo Suzuki, who I believe is the real founder of $SHIB, visited MIT‚Äôs media lab in 2019. Yeah, this same media lab that links Gensler, Epstein & Gates? What if I told you the Canadian Ryo Suzuki was also an intern for Microsoft when Shiba Inu launched? https://t.co/H2PM5FNkLb pic.twitter.com/nwkUz27Cu4 ‚Äî TruthLabs ü´° (@BoringSleuth) August 31, 2023 Unveiling Shocking Connections After debuting the theories on Thursday, it seemed Boring Sleuth was not done as a continuation was posted on Friday morning. This time around, the on-chain sleuth presents theories that connect the alleged founder to prominent personalities and organizations. The first of these was a connection to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin through a series of transactions that connected the Shiba Inu deployer wallet to Buterin‚Äôs wallet. The wallet in question identified as ‚Äú0x2135‚Äù was not only connected to Buterin, however. The sleuth lists out notable people and organizations the wallet has also been connected to in the tweet below: Wallet 0x2135 is connected to: Multiple Vitalik Buterin wallets CCP official Roger Lim (HATES the West) Satofishi, Binance Dev/Stakefish Founder Wanxiang (Gensler gave them special Broker Dealer license) LingLing & Multichain Dev (Crypto Cartel) Maker DAO Multisig & More 7/8 pic.twitter.com/eib84d1CQN ‚Äî TruthLabs ü´° (@BoringSleuth) September 1, 2023 The infamous gifting of half the total SHIB supply to Vitalik Buterin is also called into question, which one X user refers to as ‚Äúa massive money laundering scheme.‚Äù In response, Boring Sleuth says that the ‚Äògift‚Äô was a 100% tax write-off for the Ethereum founder. ‚ÄúHe captured all the value without moving price down 1 cent,‚Äù the researcher added.

Potential catalysts for Bitcoin include the approval of a spot ETF by the SEC, liquid staking capabilities on the Lightning Network, and the upcoming halving event in Q2 2024. Investors should monitor macroeconomic events that could influence investor sentiment and the crypto market. Thesis Following the recent Court of Appeals for the D.C Circuit ruling in favor of Grayscale Investments LLC in its lawsuit pertaining to the application to convert its Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) into a spot Bitcoin ETF, the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) quickly moved towards the previous $28,000 trading range. However, BTC retraced the price surge of the Grayscale-vs-SEC news in just 2 days, making the bullishness fade quickly. Ripple ( XRP-USD ) saw a similar surge in its coin price following a ruling in favor of Ripple in its long-drawn brawl with the SEC. XRP gained 74% to trade at $0.82 following the news of the ruling; but has, however, retraced the gains (just like Bitcoin) and is back at the $0.5 price range. This is why I feel it is essential to separate the bullish headlines from the true catalysts that can propel Bitcoin and the broader crypto market into a new bull season. While recent events, such as Grayscale's legal victory and XRP's courtroom triumph, may have caused temporary price surges, they are not the drivers needed for long-term and sustainable price gains. In this article, we'll delve into some catalysts that could usher Bitcoin into a new wave of value appreciation, based on recent developments in the Bitcoin network and its expanding ecosystem. Potential Catalysts for Bitcoin Moving Forward While some headline-making events can cause sudden bullishness, there are a few ongoing developments that investors must understand and identify, in this current cycle, as the catalysts that could sustainably elevate Bitcoin's value. Spot ETF Approval We already witnessed some bullishness that the news of the favorable Grayscale ETF ruling propelled. That was the very tip of the iceberg, compared to how the market will react when a BTC spot ETF gets approved by the SEC. The anticipation of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval has been a lingering hope in the crypto community. It will mark a significant milestone if and when the SEC greenlights an ETF. Unlike the recent legal ruling that merely caused short-lived excitement, a spot ETF will open the doors for institutional investors to flow substantial capital into Bitcoin. The impact of institutional participation cannot be understated, as it has the potential to provide stability and drive long-term growth. Liquid Staking on the Lightning Network Beyond the ecosystem expansion and adoption, the Bitcoin network is undergoing transformative changes. New capabilities are being added to Bitcoin. Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network have given Bitcoin the chance to go through transformation and upgrades without sparking the usual debates which often lead to hard forks. We witnessed the Taproot upgrade to Bitcoin late last year, and how it gave the Bitcoin network the capability to host NFTs and Bitcoin tokens (BRC-20) through the Ordinal Protocol. BRC-20 has grown rapidly and is considered a top crypto narrative for the coming years. There are recent reports of the introduction of liquid staking capabilities on Bitcoin through the Lightning Network. Liquid staking has been a top and booming crypto narrative since Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) completed the Shapella upgrade. A crypto liquid project focused on developing liquid staking capabilities on Bitcoin reportedly raised $3.5 million in a seed funding round. This shows how bringing DeFi capabilities to Bitcoin has begun to take serious shape. The Halving Event Bitcoin's scheduled halving events have historically led to a crypto bull market. Though it is strongly advised not to predict the future direction of the crypto market based on historical outcomes, I still see Bitcoin's halving as a notable event that cannot be overlooked. The upcoming halving event in Q2 2024 is already on the radar of investors, and it is much talked about by seasoned crypto investors as the countdown to the halving event has already begun. A search of hashtags related to Bitcoin halving on the X (Twitter) app confirms this. Halving is a natural, built-in mechanism that can sustainably drive Bitcoin's price upward. I'm Bullish on Bitcoin Bitcoin ETF Deadlines (Bloomberg) As a crypto investor who has witnessed two market cycles, my outlook on Bitcoin is bullish, and I maintain a HOLD rating as we closely monitor unfolding events. The SEC has delayed its decision on all Bitcoin ETF applications till October, as the current deadline elapses. The second deadline for spot ETF applications in mid-October is a crucial date to watch. A successful spot ETF approval would be a significant catalyst for Bitcoin, aligning with the broader trend of institutional adoption. Conclusion While recent legal developments have created short-term excitement, focusing on the true catalysts that can sustain Bitcoin's price surge is essential. A potential Bitcoin Spot ETF approval, liquid staking, and other DeFi and NFT capabilities on the Bitcoin network, coupled with the upcoming halving event in Q2 2024; represent the core drivers that can drive Bitcoin and the crypto market into full bull mode.

With over 820,000 new wallet addresses and more than 90,000 daily transactions, Shibarium has demonstrated its appeal to users seeking faster, cheaper, and more private off-chain transactions while leveraging the security of the underlying Ethereum blockchain. Shibarium Emerges Strong Shibarium operates as a layer-2 network built on the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to enable faster, more cost-effective, and privacy-focused off-chain transactions while leveraging Ethereum‚Äôs security features. Related Reading: Bitcoin Freefall Alert: On-Chain Metrics Expose Vulnerability, Targets $23,000 The recent increase in Shibarium‚Äôs metrics carries significant implications for the Shiba Inu project and its native token, SHIB. Furthermore, the growing number of wallet addresses and daily transactions within the network indicates an expanding user base and increased interest in the SHIB token. On the same note, the rapid growth of Shibarium‚Äôs user base demonstrates its potential to enhance scalability and drive wider adoption of the Shiba Inu project. By addressing Ethereum‚Äôs scalability limitations through its layer-2 solution, Shibarium aims to improve the user experience by enabling faster and more cost-efficient transactions. Shibarium scan plays a crucial role in monitoring the network‚Äôs progress. The platform‚Äôs data reveals surpassing 820,000 new wallet addresses, indicating the growing community embracing Shibarium‚Äôs benefits. As Shibarium‚Äôs metrics continue to show positive trends, it bodes well for the future of the Shiba Inu ecosystem and the SHIB token. The network‚Äôs ability to provide faster, cost-effective, and private transactions will likely attract more users, driving adoption and strengthening the ecosystem. Looking ahead, Shibarium is expected to play a pivotal role in supporting the growth and scalability of the Shiba Inu project. The recent surge in Shibarium‚Äôs metrics, with over 820,000 wallet addresses and over 90,000 daily transactions, marks a significant milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. As a layer-2 network built on Ethereum, Shibarium focuses on enhancing transaction speed, reducing costs, and prioritizing privacy. This achievement is significant for the Shiba Inu project and the SHIB token, demonstrating the network‚Äôs potential for scalability, broader adoption, and continued growth. With Shibarium‚Äôs infrastructure in place, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is well-positioned to thrive in the evolving landscape of decentralized finance. Shiba Inu Faces Market Headwinds Despite recent developments, the Shiba Inu ecosystem faces some challenges, particularly its native token, SHIB, which has been affected by the overall market trend. SHIB is trading at $0.00000783, reflecting a 2% decline over the past 24 hours. More notably, the token remains significantly below its year-to-date price, experiencing a decline of over 34%. Of particular concern for SHIB bulls is the key support level at $0.00000762, which has been instrumental in sustaining the token‚Äôs price since July and has allowed occasional surges to $0.00001134. Related Reading: The Secret Victory: How Bitcoin Flipped The Energy Consumption Narrative However, should the market recover and resume its bullish trend, SHIB may encounter a noteworthy obstacle in the form of its 50-day Moving Average (represented by the brown line in the chart).

The SEC is seeking a federal judge's approval to appeal her ruling finding that Ripple's programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities law. If Judge Analisa Torres, of the Southern District of New York, signs off on the bid, the SEC will need to convince the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to take up the case. In its filing Friday, Ripple argued that there are no controlling law questions and that an appeal wouldn't lead to a faster resolution of the overall case.  July's ruling did not ""present a controlling question of law,"" and neither did the SEC's motion for an appeal, Ripple said in Friday's filing, which added that the regulator hasn't proven that different judges might disagree with the ruling, or that an appeal would lead to a faster end for the court case ‚Äì all of which are requirements for the judge to approve an appeal, according to the filing.  Judge Torres found in July that while Ripple violated federal securities laws in selling XRP to institutional investors, it had not done the same in making XRP available to retail investors by putting it on exchanges.  A different judge in the same court, Judge Jed Rakoff, disagreed with Judge Torres' assessment in his own ruling in the SEC's case against Terraform Labs, a point the regulator brought up when it filed the substantive part of its appeal on August 18.  In Friday's filing, Ripple said the factual bases underlying each case were different, leading to the different rulings.  ""This Court‚Äôs summary-judgment ruling relied on record evidence that Ripple made no 'promises or offers' to purchasers in Programmatic Sales,"" the filing said. ""Terraform, by contrast, accepted the SEC‚Äôs allegations that Terraform and its founder promised all purchasers ‚Äì those who bought directly from Terraform or from some other source ‚Äì 'rates of returns of 19-20% on the coin owners‚Äô initial investment.'""

Data by crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows that addresses holding at least 0.1% of the bitcoin supply ‚Äì worth more than $500 million ‚Äì increased their stash by a total of $1.5 billion in the last two weeks of August.  The increase occurred while inflows into centralized exchanges were near zero, suggesting that ‚Äúthere is organic buying demand rather than just funds moving to exchange addresses,‚Äù Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a report.  Whales are entities who control large amounts of a digital asset. Their purchases and sales can have a sizable impact on markets, thus crypto watchers closely follow their behavior to anticipate market movements.  The purchases happened during a period when BTC‚Äôs price sunk to a two-month low, temporarily lifted by an important court decision in Grayscale‚Äôs campaign to list a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S.  Large holders first loaded up after Aug. 17, when BTC plunged more than 10% to below $26,000, its lowest price since June, IntoTheBlock data shows.  They also increased holdings earlier this week following asset manager Grayscale‚Äôs court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A federal appeals court ordered the agency to vacate and review its denial to convert the $14 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a more-desirable spot bitcoin ETF.  Analysts interpreted the court‚Äôs decision as a key advance towards listing the first spot BTC ETF in the U.S., making the largest cryptocurrency more accessible for a new class of investors.  Still, BTC has erased all gains from the brief rally ignited by the Grayscale ruling and slid back below $26,000 on Friday.

The details surrounding this unlocking event have been transparently shared with the public.

Reference:https://t.co/58X45YBAzy pic.twitter.com/zVwTuECUaS ‚Äî Token Unlocks (@Token_Unlocks) August 30, 2023 With this event, chances are that some of the scheduled unlocked tokens could likely be used to reward SUI‚Äôs Active Contributors and Early Supporters (ACES) program. As instituted by the SUI developer, Mysten Labs, earlier this year, the ACES program was crafted as a gesture of gratitude. It aimed to acknowledge and reward those SUI discord members whose contributions were pivotal before the altcoin‚Äôs mainnet launch. Moreover, alongside this unlocking, data from Token Unlocks suggest that SUI also intends to set aside a portion of the unlocked tokens for staking incentives. What To Expect From SUI? With such a significant amount set to unlock, the temptation to sell might arise for some early supporters, especially if a portion is rewarded to Active Contributors and Early Supporters. This could potentially lead to a sell-off. Historically, massive token unlocks have sometimes resulted in short-term price depressions, given the increased market supply. Furthermore, the network, which has seen rapid expansion, has also recorded a user base jump from 3 million to 5 million users in a mere 14 days and then further to 6 million active accounts within another three days.

16882584,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549771,1693594836,This Metric Hinted At The Bitcoin Retrace In Advance,"The trend in the total supply of the stablecoins may have hinted in advance that the Bitcoin rally wouldn‚Äôt last too long. Bitcoin Stablecoins Supply Hasn‚Äôt Moved Much Recently An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that the latest news has been unable to make the stablecoins supply budge. The ‚Äústablecoins supply‚Äù here refers to the total circulating supply of all stablecoins in the sector. Generally, investors use stables to escape the volatility associated with most coins in the rest of the cryptocurrency sector. Thus, whenever this metric rises, new tokens of the stablecoins are being minted because there is a demand for converting to them from the other assets or fresh demand is coming into the market. Such investors who seek safety in these fiat-tied tokens usually do so because they don‚Äôt want to exit the cryptocurrency sector completely; they only require a temporary place to station their capital. When these holders eventually find that the prices are right to jump back into the volatile coins like Bitcoin, they swap their stablecoins into them, thus putting buying pressure on their prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $26,000 As Miners Sell Big Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the stablecoins supply over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been heading down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant In the graph, the quant has marked a specific correlation between the Bitcoin spot price and the stablecoin supply. It would appear that all the major increases in the former during the past year have come following rises in the latter metric. There are three instances of this trend in this period: the first formed before the January rally, the second before the March rebound, and the third before the June surge. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs What Bitcoin Price The Bull Market Will Start According To This Analyst From the chart, it‚Äôs apparent that the price increase in the asset wasn‚Äôt caused by the increases in the supply of the stables but rather the decline in them that followed afterward. The increases in the supply of the stablecoins likely occurred because of fresh capital injections. When this new capital was deployed into Bitcoin and the others (when the indicator declined), the assets obtained the fuel for their rallies. With the most recent rally in the asset instigated by the news of Grayscale‚Äôs victory against the US SEC, there was no such pattern in the supply of these fiat-tied assets. This may have been one of the early signs that the rally wasn‚Äôt backed by constructive market growth, as the stablecoins supply has only been moving sideways. The Bitcoin retrace below the $26,000 level may have only been a natural consequence of this weak structure. BTC Price Bitcoin had earlier fully retraced the gains of the Grayscale rally, but it would appear that the decline isn‚Äôt over just yet, as the asset has now gone below the $26,000 level it had been at before the surge.

In a governance forum post, he said the codebase‚Äôs ‚Äútechnical quality,‚Äù its ‚Äúresilience by having gone through the FTX blowup‚Äù and already functioning examples make Solana ‚Äúthe most promising codebase to explore further.‚Äù  He also mentioned Cosmos as the other ‚Äúmain contender.‚Äù  MakerDAO is a largest decentralized finance lender and also the issuer of the $5 billion DAI stablecoin. It is currently undergoing a major, multi-year overhaul called Endgame that includes breaking up the project into smaller, independent entities (SubDAOs) with their own tokens and revamping its governance token MKR and stablecoin DAI.  The plan‚Äôs final phase would be the rollout of a bespoke blockchain ‚Äì under the codename NewChain, for the time being ‚Äì to connect all SubDAOs and ostensibly make the ecosystem more resilient to governance attacks and technical failures, Christensen explained in the post.  The NewChain is a ‚Äúmajor long term project, and will likely take at least 3 years,‚Äù he said.  Maker‚Äôs endorsement would be a symbolic win for the embattled Solana ecosystem, badly wounded by the collapse of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs downfall, who had been one of the network‚Äôs biggest supporters and investors.  ‚ÄúI am honestly speechless,‚Äù Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, posted on X (formerly Twitter) following Christensen‚Äôs comments. ‚ÄúThe more code reuse we have across all ecosystems the faster everything grows.‚Äù  ""Rune‚Äôs proposal for the future of MakerDAO is a fantastic showcase of how the high-performance technology behind Solana and the Solana Virtual Machine can power the next wave of innovation in this space,"" Austin Federa, head of strategy at the Solana Foundation, told CoinDesk in a statement.

16879753,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549778,1693591222,"Bitcoin Freefall Alert: On-Chain Metrics Expose Vulnerability, Targets $23,000","The recent decline in Bitcoin (BTC) has raised concerns among market participants as the largest cryptocurrency struggles to maintain its upward momentum. With the loss of key moving averages and the $27,000 level, BTC‚Äôs sharp decline has been exacerbated by negative market sentiment and delays in the approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Adding to the bearish outlook is the analysis of on-chain data, which suggests a lack of strong support below the $25,400 mark. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has emphasized this concern, highlighting the potential for a swift correction down to $23,340. However, the volatile nature of the Bitcoin market means that the outcome remains uncertain. Bitcoin Faces Extended Downtrend Ali Martinez‚Äôs recent post on X (formerly Twitter) has shed light on the on-chain data analysis for Bitcoin. Martinez points out that BTC is currently lacking robust support below the $25,400 level. Related Reading: Hedera Falls To Critical Support Level: Can HBAR Rebound This September? This observation is based on BTC‚Äôs UTxO Realized Price Age Distribution, which provides insights into different cohorts‚Äô holding behavior by overlaying a range of realized prices along with age bands. The analysis indicates a vulnerability in BTC‚Äôs price structure, suggesting that a break below the $25,400 threshold could trigger a swift correction downward to $23,340. Moreover, the negative sentiment in the market, coupled with regulatory delays in the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC, has added to the bearish outlook for Bitcoin. Many market participants had anticipated that the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs would act as a catalyst for a potential recovery in the near term. However, the prolonged delay in their approval has dampened investor sentiment and increased uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency‚Äôs future price trajectory. The lack of a favorable regulatory framework has further contributed to the extended downtrend and heightened market volatility. This said, if Bitcoin breaks below the critical support level at $25,400, as suggested by the on-chain data analysis, it could lead to a rapid correction down to $23,340. Such a significant decline would heighten concerns among investors and potentially trigger further selling pressure. Healthy BTC Correction? Adding to the analysis of the Bitcoin market, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto provides a broader context by highlighting the likelihood of the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) gap closure and the significance of the $23,000 level as strong support. According to Egrag Crypto, even if BTC retraces to this point, it should be seen as a natural correction within the framework of an ongoing bull market. Egrag Crypto suggests that the CME gap closure is a phenomenon where the price of Bitcoin fills the price gap created between the closing and opening prices of the CME futures market over the weekend. In this case, the gap exists around the $23,300 level, which indicates a potential area of strong support. This observation aligns with the notion that Bitcoin tends to fill these gaps over time. While a retracement to $23,300 may cause concern among investors, Egrag Crypto emphasizes that it should be viewed as a healthy correction within the broader context of a bull market. Related Reading: FTX‚Äôs-Sam Bankman-Fried Puts Trial Defense Together With 7 Expert Witnesses Corrections are a normal part of any market cycle, and Bitcoin has historically experienced periods of consolidation and retracement before continuing its upward trajectory. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $25,990, representing a 4% decline within the 24-hour period and a substantial 11% drop over the past 30 days. Despite these recent losses, the flagship cryptocurrency has successfully maintained its year-to-date gains, boasting a remarkable profit of over 29% since September 2022.

Ripple Wants Compliance Talent Ripple is seemingly looking to improve its compliance with sanctions and regulatory developments through a more proactive approach. To this end, the payments processor is actively hiring talent to fill a role advertised as ‚ÄúWeb3 Specialist, Global KYC & Due Diligence.‚Äù Related Reading: Here‚Äôs What Bitcoin Price The Bull Market Will Start According To This Analyst The job which carries an $85,000-$106,000 pay range is advertised to ‚Äúbe heavily focused on carrying out due diligence to mitigate regulatory, reputational and sanctions risks associated with Ripple‚Äôs institutional clients, counterparties and corporate partners to ensure compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (‚ÄúAML‚Äù), Counter-Terrorist Financing, Economic Sanctions regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act (‚ÄúBSA‚Äù) and USA PATRIOT Act.‚Äù In light of these developments, Monica Long of Ripple in the US recently articulated the company‚Äôs strategy, saying, ‚ÄúWe are very excited about this because we now have clarity on how Ripple will conduct its business in the future. And we are resuming operations in the US market.‚Äù This statement signifies Ripple‚Äôs intention to continue its operations in the United States. The recruitment also points to Ripple‚Äôs efforts to mitigate regulatory violations following its 3-year-long battle with the SEC. A Global Hiring Shift Reflects Ripple‚Äôs Ambitious Expansion Ripple has been one of the leading crypto firms that has continued to hire talent at a time when layoffs are the order of the day in the industry. GlobalData, a data analytics firm, reports that Ripple has increased its job postings by 26.9% during January-April 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. While the hiring trend in the US has declined slightly, Ripple has significantly ramped up job postings in Canada, Poland, India, and other countries. Sherla Sriprada, Business Fundamentals Analyst at GlobalData, noted at the time, ‚ÄúRipple‚Äôs decision to primarily hire employees from outside the US reflects a strategic move towards global expansion, accessing international talent while also overcoming regulatory challenges in the US by diversifying its presence in other markets.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $26,000 As SEC Pushes Back On 7 Spot ETF Filings This means that despite its commitment to remaining in the US market, Ripple is actively going after talents in other jurisdictions.

Moreover, the institution received expert feedback and evaluated energy consumption as just one of many items to create an accurate index. Cambridge has been working on this issue since July 2019 and launching other tools besides the CBECI to help track Bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption, hashrate distribution, and greenhouse (GHG) emissions. The revised model uses data from BTC mining hardware manufacturers, governments, and other sources. This data affected estimations by looking into the distribution of newer mining equipment and the different energy sources leveraged by this nascent industry. The institution clarified: (‚Ä¶) the backbone of our previous CBECI methodology was the assumption that every profitable hardware model released less than 5 years ago equally fuelled the total network hashrate. This, however, led to a disproportionally large number of older devices compared to newer ones in our assumed hardware distribution during exceptionally profitable mining periods. The chart below shows the new model‚Äôs discrepancies with the 2019 CBECI. In particular, the model differed from the 2021 model, when the Bitcoin price rallied, and mining profitability was high. Energy consumption at that time stood at 89 Terawatt per hour (TWh), according to the revised CBECI model. The old model showed a much higher figure at 104 TWh. The report stated: In terms of global electricity consumption, it represented about 0.38%. As for 2023, the year-to-date electricity consumption estimate has been revised from 75.7 TWh to 70.4 TWh. A Look Into The Future Cambridge expressed its desire to continue informing the public about Bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption. However, the institution called the process ‚Äúelusive‚Äù and committed to only providing approximated numbers on the nascent BTC mining sector. The report acknowledged the advantages of using Bitcoin mining to offset carbon emissions via different methods and its impact on noise disturbances, water use, and thermal pollution. This report is one of the many that have emerged over the past three months. Major consultancy company KPMG highlighted the benefits of using the cryptocurrency to push energy demand into its next era and generally attempted to tear down the myths surrounding the industry.

Bitcoin Miner To Exchange Flow Has Spiked During The Past Day As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the miners have been showing signs of selling recently. The relevant indicator here is the ‚Äúminer to exchange flow,‚Äù which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin that miners are depositing to exchanges. Generally, these chain validators only make such transactions when they intend to sell, so the indicator‚Äôs value observing a spike can be a sign of a selloff. The below chart shows the trend in the 7-day moving average (MA) BTC miner to exchange flow over the past couple of weeks: Looks like the 7-day MA value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the graph, the 7-day MA Bitcoin miner to exchange flow has seen a huge spike during the past day. The quant has also highlighted the previous instances of high values of the indicator that occurred in the past two weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Returns To Neutral, Will Traders Embrace Greed Next? It would appear that the BTC price has generally registered a drawdown whenever the miners make large deposits to these platforms. With the latest spike in the metric, too, the cryptocurrency has taken a plunge, as its price has now returned back to the $26,000 level, completely erasing the recovery that the Grayscale rally had brought. It‚Äôs never a certainty that the deposits that these holders are making are indeed for selling, but given the timing of the price drawdown, it would appear likely that the miners were looking to sell after all. In the chart, the analyst has also attached the data for a few more metrics. First, there are the ‚Äúminer inflow‚Äù and ‚Äúminer outflow‚Äù indicators, which, as their name suggests, measure the amount of Bitcoin that the miners are transferring into and out of their wallets, respectively. Related Reading: Ethereum Traders Capitulate As Rally Slows Down: Why This Is Good From the graph, it‚Äôs visible that the BTC miner outflow spiked during the crash, which makes sense as the miners had made some transfers from their wallets toward exchanges. The miner inflow, however, had also registered high values at the same time, meaning that fresh coins had entered back into the wallets of these chain validators. This would suggest that some of the miners may have used the opportunity of the crash to expand their holdings. The ‚Äúminer reserve,‚Äù the other metric of interest here, measures the total amount of Bitcoin that this cohort is carrying in its wallets right now and this indicator‚Äôs data would confirm that the holdings of the miners have actually gone up during the price drop. So, while some Bitcoin miners may have contributed to the selling pressure, others have more than made up for it by accumulating more of the cryptocurrency. BTC Price As mentioned before, Bitcoin has now seen a complete retrace of the returns from the latest rally, bringing the asset back to the $26,000 level it had previously been consolidating at.

Traders are paying as much as 2,000% annualized in fees to buy the tokens on margin.  They run risk of being caught out; most market pumps are sold quickly amid a generally bearish environment.  There‚Äôs always a niche token pump in crypto circles if you search hard enough, regardless of whether bitcoin (BTC) is moving or not.  One example: The CYBER token of ‚ÄúWeb3 social network‚Äù CyberConnect, which has a market cap of $113 million, according to CoinGecko and has more than doubled in the past week to post one of the biggest jumps in an otherwise flat market. Trading volumes have zoomed alongside. Some $225 million worth of the tokens exchanged hands in the past 24 hours across crypto exchanges, up nearly 10-fold from Monday‚Äôs $30 million in volumes.  And traders are so desperate to get a piece of the action, data shows they are paying more than 2000% to buy the tokens on margin.  But CyberConnect runs the risk of being the latest crypto fad. Similar projects, such as Friend.tech, which lets X personalities create token-gated chat groups, gained meaningful popularity only to see revenue drop 95% in just over three weeks.  CyberConnect lets developers create applications related to digital identity, content and friendships on the blockchain. It also offers CyberGraph, a smart contract to record users‚Äô content and social connections, and CyberID, an ERC-721 token that represents a unique handle for user accounts within the CyberConnect ecosystem.  Funding rates, which are periodic payments traders on perpetual futures markets pay to their counterparties, have soared to as much as an annualized 2,190% on Bybit and Bitget and as high as 1,500% on Binance.  The rates are determined by the difference between spot and futures contract prices. When futures cost more than spot, traders with long positions pay a fee to traders with short positions. The positive funding rates for CYBER suggest speculators are bullish, and long traders are paying out.  Most of the trades are taking place on Binance, data shows, with the exchange accounting for 74% of all CYBER volume. This is followed by the Korean exchange UpBit, which traded $70 million worth of the tokens.  Friend.tech launched on Aug. 10 and racked up some 4,400 ETH (about $8.1 million) in trading volume on the first day, growing further as a slew of personalities outside of crypto circles on X, formerly Twitter, joined the platform and fueled its popularity.  Data shows transactional activity on the platform peaked at $16 million on Aug. 21 before slumping to just over $700,000 as of Thursday ‚Äì a 95% drop.

Amid the fracas, the former exchange CEO has maintained that he isn‚Äôt guilty of all these charges leveled against him and will be reportedly bringing expert witnesses to prove his innocence. Sam Bankman-Fried Defense To Call Seven Expert Witnesses According to a Bloomberg report, Sam Bankman-Fried is employing the services of seven different expert witnesses to help bolster his case. These expert witnesses may form part of SBF‚Äôs defense, and if so, they will be allegedly paid $1,200 an hour to testify in favor of FTX‚Äôs former CEO. This means that SBF‚Äôs defense could be spending up to $8,400 an hour for these expert witnesses, a staggering figure given that high-profile trials like these can drag out for a long time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $26,000 As SEC Pushes Back On 7 Spot ETF Filings This list of expert witnesses released so far includes Lawrence Akka, Thomas Bishop, Brian Kim, Joseph Pimbley, Bradley Smith, Peter Vinella, and Andrew Di Wu. Expert witnesses are persons with specialized knowledge in a particular field. They are usually called upon in court proceedings to break down complex or technical issues that the Judge and the jury may not be conversant with. According to the defendant‚Äôs notice, SBF‚Äôs expert witnesses will give evidence of various issues, including campaign finance laws, the finances of FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, and the crypto exchange‚Äôs software infrastructure. However, it is surprising that SBF is calling an expert witness to give background information on the US campaign finance laws, considering that the prosecution had dropped the charge of him violating campaign finance rules. The charge was dropped because it didn‚Äôt form part of the US government‚Äôs extradition agreement with the Bahamas government, and thus had no legs to stand on. But it seems defending himself against such allegations is important to the FTX founder given he is preparing a defense for it. FTT continues to decline as trial draws closer | Source: FTTUSD on Tradingview.com DOJ Objects To SBF‚Äôs Expert Witnesses In reply to SBF‚Äôs notice of his expert witnesses, the government has filed a motion to exclude the testimony of these witnesses. The prosecutors argue that these experts and their accompanying disclosures suffer from an ‚Äúarray of deficiencies‚Äù that necessitate their exclusion. For one, their opinions have no basis as required by the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure. According to the prosecutors, their opinions, among other things, are ‚Äúirrelevant, unfairly prejudicial, and confusing to the jury.‚Äù They further argue that these experts will offer legal conclusions that ‚Äúinvade‚Äù the power of the court and the jury, so the court should exercise its ‚Äúgatekeeping authority‚Äù and preclude their testimonies.‚Äù The Prosecutor‚Äôs motion contains extensive arguments on why each of these expert witnesses‚Äô opinions should be excluded. They stated that Professor Smith‚Äôs testimony is ‚Äúirrelevant, confusing, and a waste of time‚Äù since SBF‚Äôs trial doesn‚Äôt include a charge stemming from the defendant‚Äôs ‚Äúillegal campaign finance scheme.‚Äù Related Reading: Dogecoin And Bitcoin Become Latest Additions To Robinhood Wallet Meanwhile, they argue that Mr. Vinella‚Äôs testimony should be excluded on the grounds of qualifications, relevancy, and admissibility. If rejected, they have the court to grant them a Daubert hearing to evaluate his ‚Äúqualifications, methodology, and the relevance and reliability of his proposed testimony. Mr. Vinella seems to be SBF‚Äôs primary expert witness as he is set to opine on various topics, including FTX‚Äôs operations and how the company took ‚Äúcommercially reasonable steps‚Äù to protect customers‚Äô funds despite the lack of regulatory clarity in the US. SBF currently faces seven counts of financial fraud, including wire fraud on FTX and Alameda customers, securities fraud, and money laundering.

The latest roadblock at the formidable $225 resistance level has compounded the altcoin‚Äôs long-term bearish bias, casting a shadow over its prospects in the crypto landscape. Taking a closer look at BNB‚Äôs recent performance, the altcoin faced a flurry of selling pressure in mid-August, a critical moment that saw the key support level of $225 transform into a major resistance. This shift firmly established bearish dominance on the higher timeframes, shaking investor confidence in BNB‚Äôs ability to rally. However, not all hope was lost as bulls rallied from the nearby support level just above $205, providing a glimmer of optimism amidst the prevailing bearish sentiment. Related Reading: The ApeCoin Quandary: Why Additional Losses Could Persist BNB‚Äôs Price and On-Chain Metrics BNB‚Äôs price, currently hovering at $213 according to CoinGecko, reflects the ongoing volatility. Over the past 24 hours, BNB has witnessed a 4.5% decline, while its seven-day performance shows a modest gain of 0.4%. BNB price action today. Source: Coingecko The Relative Strength Index (RSI), after a recent surge that took it above the neutral 50, experienced a sharp drop from the 60-mark, signaling unstable demand and wavering investor sentiment. Examining BNB‚Äôs on-chain metrics, we find interesting developments among market speculators. Coinalyze data reveals that the futures market reacted strongly to the short-term pump on August 29, with a sharp drop in Open Interest (OI). This indicates that traders may be growing cautious as they navigate the unpredictable waters of the BNB market. Source: Coinalyze Prospects for the Future Looking ahead, the fate of BNB appears to hinge on the weekly time frame and the closing price of its charts. If the week concludes with a strong closure above the $230 mark, buyers may seize the initiative. This potential resurgence could pave the way for a further climb towards the $240 zone, offering a glimmer of hope for BNB enthusiasts. However, a separate report highlights that such a scenario remains relevant only until mid-September, and the market‚Äôs mood can shift rapidly. BNB market cap currently at $32.9 billion.

42419694,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFNu9,1693571896,First Mover Americas: SEC Delays Spot Bitcoin ETF Decision for All Applicants,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk‚Äôs daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed until October a decision on all spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications submitted by firms including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Wise Origin, VanEck, Bitwise and Valkyrie Digital Assets, according to agency filings on Thursday. The SEC began reviewing the latest slate of applications from both crypto-heavy and traditional finance firms last month. The applicants hope to launch the first spot bitcoin ETF, which advocates have argued will allow for greater retail investment in the bitcoin market while saving investors the trouble of setting up a wallet or having to buy the cryptocurrency directly.  Bitcoin and major tokens gave back all weekly gains as the SEC delayed key ETF decisions that were expected on Friday, damping traders‚Äô hopes of a long-term recovery. The largest cryptocurrency fell under $26,000. In the past 24 hours, majors solana (SOL) and litecoin (LTC) dropped as much as 5.5% while ether (ETH) lost 3.7%. Bitcoin cash (BCH) slid 7.7%. Only tron (TRX) and toncoin (TON) were in the green on Friday, up over 1% each.  A New York court classified popular cryptocurrencies ether and bitcoin as ""commodities"" while dismissing a proposed class action lawsuit against leading decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap in a Wednesday filing. The lawsuit ‚Äì filed in April 2022 by a group of investors against Uniswap and its creator Hayden Adams ‚Äì alleged the DeFi platform violated U.S. securities laws by failing to register as an exchange or broker-dealer, offering and soliciting securities on an unregistered exchange. The suit sought to hold Uniswap accountable for investors losing money to ‚Äúscam tokens‚Äù issued and traded on the protocol. The tokens cited in the suit include Ethereum (ERC-20) tokens EthereumMax (EMAX), Bezoge (BEZOGE) and Alphawolf Finance (AWF). But Wednesday's ruling to scrap the suit before it goes to trial stated the true defendants of the case were the issuers of the tokens in question, not Uniswap. While SEC Chief Gary Gensler has so far shied away from calling ETH a security, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York directly called it a commodity and declined to ""stretch the federal securities laws to cover the conduct alleged,"" in the case against Uniswap.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price and the balance held by large holders, or addresses owning 0.1% of supply.  These addresses have added over $1.5 billion of bitcoin in the last two weeks.  ""It's not just large investors that appear to be buying bitcoin, the broader market also appears to be growing on-chain,"" IntoTheBlock said.

The unemployment rate for August was 3.8% versus forecasts for 3.5% and last month's 3.5%.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) was little-changed at just above $26,000 in the minutes following Friday morning's report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Traditional markets, however, are reacting, with U.S. stock index futures moving higher, while the greenback and Treasury yields slip lower.  It's been a rough week for bitcoin, which surged to above $28,000 Tuesday following Grayscale's court victory over the SEC in that company's quest to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin ETF. As has been typical of rallies for several months now, bitcoin quickly began reversing those gains. The reversal turned into a full plunge on Thursday, with bitcoin falling more than 4% and below $26,000 as the SEC delayed making decisions on a multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity.  With ETF hopes shelved for what could me many more months, bitcoin bulls might be looking to a softening in the economy and thus lower interest rates as a possible catalyst. While this morning's report provided some interest in the form of a rising unemployment rate and a downward revision to July's job additions, bitcoin, so far, is showing no positive reaction.  Checking other report details, average hourly earnings were higher by 0.2% in August against forecasts for 0.3% and down from 0.4% in July. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings were up 4.3% in August versus forecasts for 4.4% and down from 4.4% in July.

42419685,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFNjp,1693569929,Stablecoins Can Provide an Escape From High-Inflation Currencies: Brevan Howard Digital,"The market for stablecoins such as tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) is expected to grow to trillions of dollars of supply and hundreds of trillions of dollars in transaction value in coming years as global audiences increasingly access the U.S. currency through these cryptocurrencies, alternative asset manager Brevan Howard Digital said in a report last week.  Stablecoins will ‚Äúincreasingly provide financial services to the global unbanked and underbanked, provide an escape from high-inflation currencies, and ignite an explosion of innovation built upon these new global open-network money movement rails,‚Äù wrote co-head of venture investments Peter Johnson and analyst Sai Nimmagadda.  The investment manager notes that payments giant Paypal (PYPL) recently launched its own stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), a move that ‚Äúhighlights the opportunity in stablecoins‚Äù and one that could ‚Äúupend global financial services.‚Äù A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, typically the U.S. dollar.  ‚ÄúIn 2022, stablecoins settled over $11t on-chain, dwarfing the volumes processed by Paypal ($1.4t), almost surpassing the payment volume of Visa ($11.6t), and reaching 14% of the volume settled by ACH, and over 1% the volume settled by Fedwire,‚Äù the authors wrote.  An ACH payment is a type of electronic bank-to-bank transfer used in the United States. Fedwire is the settlement system of central bank money operated by the U.S. Federal Reserve banks.  ‚ÄúIt is remarkable that in just a few years, a new global money movement rail can be compared with some of the world‚Äôs largest and most important payment systems,‚Äù the asset manager said.  Brevan Howard Digital notes that over 25 million blockchain addresses hold over $1 in stablecoins. In terms of a comparison with traditional finance, a U.S. bank with 25 million accounts would rank as the fifth largest by number of accounts. The large number of small-dollar stablecoin holdings also shows the ‚Äúpotential for stablecoins to provide global financial services to customers underserved by traditional financial institutions.‚Äù  ‚ÄúStablecoin usage has shown a low correlation with crypto exchange volumes,‚Äù which suggests that significant stablecoin transactions volumes are likely being used for non-speculative purposes, the report said.  Stablecoins have also shown resilience in the recent crypto market downturn, with total market cap only dropping about 24% from its peak, compared with a 57% decline for the total crypto market cap, the note added.

16861894,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549728,1693569611,Bitcoin Price Prediction For September 2023: What To Expect,"After a short-lived rally above $28,000 this week following Grayscale‚Äôs landmark court case victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the conversion of GBTC into a spot ETF, the price of BTC has once again settled around the $26,000 mark. This comes after yesterdays‚Äô SEC‚Äôs decision to postpone all Bitcoin spot ETF decisions for 45 days. Renowned crypto analyst, Rekt Capital, has weighed in on the situation with a series of tweets that provide insight into Bitcoin‚Äôs potential trajectory for the upcoming month. As the analyst remarks, Bitcoin has registered a bearish monthly candle close for the month of August due to yesterdays‚Äô price plunge. Bitcoin Price Prediction For September 2023 In a series of tweets, Rekt Capital explained, ‚ÄúBTC closed below ~$27,150, confirming it as lost support. It‚Äôs possible BTC could rebound into ~$27,150, maybe even upside wick beyond it this September. But that would likely be a relief rally to confirm ~$27,150 as new resistance before dropping into the $23,000 region. Historically, September has not been particularly kind to Bitcoin, with the month recording the least number of positive-returning months at just two, and currently being on a 6-year negative-returning streak. Related Reading: How Bitcoin And Crypto Are Impacted By The Fed‚Äôs Growing War Chest: Report Rekt Capital delves deeper into this trend, stating, ‚ÄúA frequently recurring downside amount for BTC in the month September is -7%. If BTC were to drop -7% from current price levels this month, price would retrace to ~$24,000.‚Äù However, according to the analysis by the analyst, the next major monthly level is sitting at ~$23,400. This suggests that price maybe does not stop at -7% if BTC can‚Äôt gain new momentum. Instead, BTC could potentially downside wick -10% in total to reach that next major monthly level. The analyst further elaborated on the historical performance of Bitcoin in September, noting, ‚ÄúSeptember ‚Äì positive or negative month? Typically, we tend to see a negative month for BTC in September. However, for the most part BTC sees single-digit drawdown in Septembers. 8 out of 10 of the past Septembers have experienced downside. Only 2 months saw small, single-digit gains in the month of September (+2% in 2015 and +6% in 2016).‚Äù Worst Case Scenario Drawing parallels with previous years, Rekt Capital highlighted that the most recurring drawdown in September has been a -7% dip, as observed in 2017, 2020, and 2021. However, he also pointed out that Bitcoin only saw double-digit retracement in 2019 (-13%) and in 2014 (-19%). The latter, being a bear market year, might not be the best comparison for 2023, which is shaping up to be a bottoming out year, akin to 2019 or 2015. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $26,000 As SEC Pushes Back On 7 Spot ETF Filings Addressing the looming question of another potential crash in September, the analyst opined, ‚ÄúIn 2019 BTC saw a -13% retrace but we also need to keep in mind that BTC just saw one of its worst-ever August drawdowns at -16%. It‚Äôs unlikely that Bitcoin would experience severe back-to-back drawdown both in August and now in September as well.‚Äù Concluding his analysis, Rekt Capital shared his personal forecast, ‚ÄúI think a drawdown of around -7% to -10% September could reasonably occur from current levels. This would see price drop to ~$24,000 ‚Äì $23,000.‚Äù Remarkably, there is unlikely to be a Bitcoin spot ETF decision in September, which may be the biggest catalyst for the market at the moment. The next deadlines for filings by Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity and the others is October 16 and 17. Only an action by the SEC after the lost lawsuit against Grayscale could provide a surprise event. However, there are currently no deadlines or statements from the SEC if and when they will carry out the ruling. At press time, BTC traded at $26,104.

Grayscale won its lawsuit unanimously. The court declared that the SEC‚Äôs treatment of futures versus spot bitcoin products was essentially arbitrary and unfair. While a lot of details are still being hashed out, including the timeline and process for approval, this is certainly a huge milestone for spot bitcoin ETFs. On Tuesday, Grayscale finally won its lawsuit against the SEC. For the past few years, Grayscale has been in an ongoing legal battle with the SEC over converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) product into a spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC has denied its request while approving similar futures-based bitcoin ETFs including leveraged and inverse products. Grayscale won its lawsuit unanimously. The court declared that the SEC‚Äôs treatment of futures versus spot bitcoin products was essentially arbitrary and unfair. The SEC could not adequately explain its rationale for denying spot bitcoin products. While a lot of details are still being hashed out, including the timeline and process for approval, this is certainly a huge milestone for spot bitcoin ETFs. The following questions are the most common questions I‚Äôve received. Does this mean a spot bitcoin ETF will be approved? While Grayscale‚Äôs lawsuit is a huge victory, it does not guarantee immediate approval of a spot bitcoin ETF. The court did not declare that the SEC must approve Grayscale‚Äôs ETF product. The court‚Äôs decision states that the SEC‚Äôs treatment of spot versus futures bitcoin ETFs was essentially arbitrary and unfair. The SEC did not provide adequate evidence on why they would deny spot bitcoin products versus futures bitcoin products. This means that the SEC would need to review Grayscale‚Äôs application of conversion again and consider the court decision in its approval. There could be some roadblocks (more details below). The most likely scenario is that the SEC will eventually approve Grayscale‚Äôs application along with several other filings currently in the pipeline. This isn‚Äôt an immediate guarantee of a spot product. But this is big news. Not just for Grayscale, but also for other issuers who have filed for spot bitcoin ETFs and for investors who have been advocating for a spot ETF product. What could the SEC do next, and what is the possible timeline for approval? The SEC has 45 days to appeal the decision to a full panel. But it seems unlikely that the decision would be reversed. Why? The initial ruling was unanimous among the three judges. The SEC could also potentially find another reason to deny Grayscale‚Äôs application. But this also seems unlikely. That could turn into another long, costly, and negatively viewed legal battle. While I believe we will see a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF soon, it is difficult to say for sure whether that will happen in 2023. According to a live interview with Grayscale on Bloomberg, there are still a lot of uncertainties including whether Grayscale will need to refile its application. To complicate matters, several deadlines are approaching this week for the SEC‚Äôs initial decisions on spot bitcoin ETF filings from issuers like BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, and others. If the SEC acts like it has in the past, it will delay these decisions. It would only have a couple of days to digest the Grayscale win. Final deadlines for these filings are approaching in early 2024, with the earliest occurring in January (for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF). It seems like the most likely scenario would be that all of these filings (including Grayscale‚Äôs) are approved en masse in early 2024, which would: Give the SEC time to digest the court‚Äôs rulings Put these issuers on a level playing field. So does that mean Grayscale will lose its advantage? Even if Grayscale‚Äôs approval falls under the same timeline as other ETF issuers, I think Grayscale might still have an advantage over other issuers. First of all, their GBTC product has already accumulated assets whereas all the other issuers would be starting from zero. Second, they have been a huge voice in support of a spot bitcoin ETF and standing up to the SEC, so I believe they have accumulated a loyal fan base. GBTC has already seen renewed interest with trading volumes at their highest level in over a year. Currently, GBTC‚Äôs discount has narrowed to around 18%, compared to 50% earlier this year. Higher trading volumes and a narrower discount signal investor confidence that the conversion will be approved. What will happen to futures bitcoin ETFs? Once a spot bitcoin ETF is approved, there will likely be diminished demand for futures ETFs. However, I do not believe the SEC would change its treatment of bitcoin futures ETF given the number of products already in the market and its openness toward ether futures ETFs. There are certain cases where an investor might prefer a futures bitcoin ETF but that is typically limited to if an investor wants an inverse product, leveraged product, or something like a combination bitcoin/ether futures strategy product. But in general, an investor would prefer a spot bitcoin ETF versus a futures bitcoin ETF. Disclosure: ¬© VettaFi LLC 2023. All rights reserved.

16858795,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549723,1693566043,Here‚Äôs What Bitcoin Price The Bull Market Will Start According To This Analyst,"The Bitcoin price has been experiencing a series of price fluctuations for two years now. The cryptocurrency has been on a bullish threshold multiple times but has failed to hold a bullish momentum for long. Nevertheless, a Bloomberg analyst has predicted an unfeigned bull run for BTC, but the potential uptrend comes with certain factors and conditions. Investors Prepare For Possible Bitcoin Bull Run The slow growth of Bitcoin price has left investors and crypto enthusiasts hoping for a potential bull run since its crash in 2022, which saw the cryptocurrency dropping from $46,000 to below $20,000. The morale of the crypto space has been uplifted, however, following a forecast made by Senior Macro Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, who proposes a potential bull run for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $26,000 As SEC Pushes Back On 7 Spot ETF Filings In an X (formerly Twitter) post, the senior analyst implies that if the Bitcoin price rises above the $30,000 mark, investors should expect a significant bull run similar to the uptrend recorded in 2020 when Bitcoin was at its all-time high. McGlone explained that Bitcoin‚Äôs $30,000 is analogous to its $12,000 price mark in 2020, just before its surge. To put this in perspective, in 2020, while Bitcoin price was as low as $12,000, the cryptocurrency recorded one of the highest surges in its history, and McGlone has equated that price jump to the bullish momentum he foresees for Bitcoin if it crosses the $30,000 price threshold. ‚ÄúBitcoin $30,000 May Be New $12,000, With Fed-Tightening Overhang,‚Äù McGlone said in the X post. He also added that Bitcoin‚Äôs price may see substantial growth if regulatory burdens are addressed and spot Bitcoin ETFs are eventually approved. ‚ÄúThe inevitable approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the US is moving closer, but the elephant in the room for all risk assets remains. The Fed is still tightening despite the tilt toward economic contraction,‚Äù the analyst said. Factors Hindering Bullish Momentum For The Bitcoin Price As the crypto space keeps an eye out for more confirmation of a favorable price reversal for Bitcoin, several factors could impede Bitcoin‚Äôs expected growth trajectory. Industry experts have highlighted that the increased adoption of the Bitcoin ETF following Grayscale‚Äôs victory against the SEC could have a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin. However, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) previously rejected applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs by prominent financial service firms and crypto exchanges in the industry. The SEC has also delayed applications for Bitcoin ETF from renowned firms like Blackrock, and WisdomTree even after Judges from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in the US were not in favor of the SEC‚Äôs rejection of Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF. Related Reading: Dogecoin And Bitcoin Become Latest Additions To Robinhood Wallet Furthermore, the SEC has also been aggressively suing many crypto exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase. This lack of a proper regulatory framework has affected the prices of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, so crypto investors are hesitant to invest in an exchange facing multiple lawsuits and potential legal repercussions. Bitcoin‚Äôs transaction volume has also taken a hit, plunging to 3-year lows. The transaction volume declined by a staggering 90% previously cutting short a potential rally and positioning the cryptocurrency at a bearish mark. Additionally, Bitcoin mining which was once a lucrative crypto venture has also seen a significant decline for participants. However, while the factors hindering a Bitcoin price growth spurt are considerable, investors‚Äô hopes still remain strong as they prepare for a price spike.

42419690,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFNoz,1693565573,Lira-Backed TRYB Token Becomes World's Second-Largest Non-Dollar-Pegged Stablecoin,"A stablecoin backed by one of the world's most volatile currencies has become one of the leading non-U.S.-dollar-pegged stablecoins.  The Turkish-lira backed TRYB is second only to Tether's euro-pegged EURt in market cap after quadrupling in just three weeks.  While the stablecoin world is dominated by dollar-backed tokens like tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), there's a smaller chunk of the market that's pegged to other currencies. Now, a token backed by Turkey's lira (TRY), one of the most volatile fiat currencies globally, has become one of the world's leading non-U.S.-dollar-pegged stablecoins.  The Ethereum-based TRYB stablecoin from Turkey-based fintech company BiLira is pegged to the lira, allowing users to issue and redeem 1 TRYB for 1 TRY. According to the official website, the stablecoin is 100% backed by fiat reserves held in Turkish banks.  Data from Coingecko show the market cap of TRYB has surged by 325% to $136.10 million in three weeks. That makes it the world's second-largest non-USD-pegged stablecoin, just behind Tether's euro-pegged stablecoin EURt, which has a market cap of $224 million. Tether is also behind the world‚Äôs largest stablecoin, dollar-pegged USDT, with an almost $83 billion market cap.  ""Since the Turkish lira price has been very volatile and losing value against the U.S. dollar, the TRYB token is mostly a medium of exchange currency. Our customers have been using the TRYB token as a gateway to exchange their Turkish lira fiat into cryptocurrency and vice versa,"" BiLira told CoinDesk in an email.  The usage pattern is consistent with the global trend. Stablecoins are widely used as a base currency in crypto trading pairs, allowing traders to access a stable asset while bypassing the volatility in fiat currencies.  ""Stablecoins facilitate trades on crypto exchanges, serve as the underlying asset for many crypto loans, and allow market participants to avoid inefficiencies stemming from converting back to fiat currency for crypto trades,‚Äù the U.S. Federal Reserve said in December 2022. ‚ÄúThey essentially serve as both a means of payment and store of value for these transactions."" Over 80% of volume on centralized exchanges involves stablecoins, it said.  Still, even though TRYB looks to have gathered traction in Turkey, USDT remains dominant. In the past 24 hours, the USDT/TRY pair listed on the largest Turkey-based crypto exchange, BtcTurk, has seen a trading volume of $12.3 million, accounting for 18% of the total activity on the exchange. Meanwhile, the total volume in TRYB trading pairs listed on MECX, Pangolin and Icrypex is just $61,700.  Volatile market cap  TRYB's volatile market cap has drawn the attention of the crypto community.  ""The timing of the large mints and burns of TRYB is a little bit uncanny,"" ChainArgos tweeted on X. ""All burned off right before FTX collapsed. 2. Massively re-minted right after Signature Bank collapsed. 3. Burned off when Binance switched to TUSD, Prime Trust went bankrupt.""  In an email to CoinDesk, BiLira explained that, unlike other stablecoin projects, it mints and redeems tokens in batches to avoid unsustainable gas fees.  The company pre-mints an average of two days of supply and keeps it in a pre-mint wallet. The amount to be pre-minted depends on the daily issuance volume. Users receive coins in their unique deposit controlled by BiLira. When redeemed, the tokens are sent to the TRYB Redemption Sweep wallet and then to the TRYB Burn Wallet.  ""As an Emerging Country Stablecoin, minting and burning each issuance/redemption would make our operations unsustainable due to operational security standards and high gas costs,"" BiLira said.  BiLira said it's working with other stablecoin providers to improve the mint and burn functionality and their frequencies.",POSITIVE,USDT,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/01/lira-backed-tryb-token-becomes-worlds-second-largest-non-dollar-pegged-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c0bad663f751e1c392202dfe05ff8dffb2cca95-1715x939.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419679,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFNdd,1693562539,Creditors Accuse Genesis of Ballot-Stuffing Over $175M FTX Deal,"Creditors of bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Global Capital (GGC) have hit out at a proposed $175 million deal with the defunct exchange FTX, accusing GGC of vote-buying to ‚Äúmanipulate‚Äù the bankruptcy process.  The Thursday filings present another headache for Genesis, which is hoping to wind up its affairs and start returning money to former customers.  After filing for bankruptcy in January, GGC has long wrangled over how to treat over a billion dollars owed by its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), and the tentative deal hasn‚Äôt pleased all the other creditors. DCG is also CoinDesk‚Äôs parent company.  A further legal deal filed by the two bankrupt companies in mid-August lets FTX‚Äôs Alameda Research claim $175 million on the Genesis estate ‚Äì a significant drop from the $4 billion FTX originally sought ‚Äì but other creditors aren‚Äôt happy with that either.  ‚Äú[Genesis‚Äô] proposed settlement with FTX is an attempt to manipulate the plan voting process‚Ä¶ a sweetheart pre-plan deal,‚Äù said a late Thursday night filing by crypto exchange Gemini, which is owed some $766 million by Genesis, adding that the proposal ‚Äúcannot be accepted at face value.‚Äù  As bankruptcy plans must be voted on by creditors in proportion to their claims, creditors are effectively accusing Genesis of ballot-stuffing.  ‚Äú[Genesis], by entering into the Proposed Settlement, have sought to buy the support of the FTX Debtors, and their votes,‚Äù said a Thursday filing by a set of creditors which calls itself the Fair Deal Group. ‚ÄúThis is, of course, a perversion of the Chapter 11 process.‚Äù  A spokesperson for Genesis did not immediately respond to CoinDesk‚Äôs request for comment. Genesis‚Äô counsel has previously said the FTX deal will ‚Äúsignificantly smooth the path‚Äù to reorganizing the company without the cost of extended litigation.  A further ‚Äúad hoc‚Äù group of creditors said the bid by FTX to claw back loans from its ‚Äúcriminal enterprise‚Äù was ‚Äú unconscionable,‚Äù adding that FTX‚Äôs strategy in claiming billions against Genesis had been ‚Äúno more than throwing spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks.‚Äù  The ad hoc group has not revealed its membership, but has previously said its members are owed a total $2.4 billion by GGC, constituting a majority of each class of claims.  Gemini and other creditors have previously opposed the DCG deal, and said that Genesis should be stripped of monopoly rights to propose a wind-up plan. In July, Gemini also sued DCG for what it said was ‚Äúfraud‚Äù by Genesis, allegations which DCG in turn described as ‚Äúdefamatory‚Äù and a ‚Äúpublicity stunt.‚Äù  Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane is due to consider the Genesis-FTX deal at a Sept. 6 hearing in the Southern District of New York.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/01/creditors-accuse-genesis-of-ballot-stuffing-over-175m-ftx-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae190442110770b3403f715fe6ebfd7245ccff96-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Currently hovering at the $0.0500 level, this juncture has emerged as a formidable obstacle for sellers looking to capitalize on the prevailing bearish sentiment. In a price report, it was revealed that HBAR‚Äôs funding rates have consistently remained in negative territory for the past few days. This bearish skew in the futures market further underscores the challenges HBAR faces in its price recovery. The current HBAR price, as reported by CoinGecko, stands at $0.050716, with a 5.0% decline over the last 24 hours and nearly 13% drop over the past seven days. Related Reading: The ApeCoin Quandary: Why Additional Losses Could Persist Declining Open Interest Reflects Reduced Hedera Demand Adding to the bearish narrative, open interest rates for HBAR have plummeted from $27 million to $21 million within the last five days (from August 24th to August 31st). This substantial drop indicates a waning demand for HBAR within the futures market, potentially emboldening sellers to seek further gains. The fate of HBAR remains closely intertwined with Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. As Bitcoin drops below the key $26,000 level, it has retraced a significant portion of its loss courtesy of a favorable US court ruling in Grayscale Investments‚Äô Bitcoin ETF case against the Securities and Exchange Commission. HBAR market cap currently at $1.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com SEC‚Äôs ETF Delay Casts a Shadow on the Crypto Market Bitcoin‚Äôs value, along with that of other cryptocurrencies, took a hit following the SEC‚Äôs announcement of a delay in reviewing seven spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications until October. This delay has cast a shadow of uncertainty over the cryptocurrency market, impacting investor sentiment. CoinShares, in its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, revealed that digital assets collectively experienced outflows of $168 million over the past week, marking a two-week streak of declining investments. This negative sentiment can be attributed to the growing belief that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF will take longer than initially anticipated. HBAR seven-day price movement. Source: Coingecko. Related Reading: Can Shiba Inu Climb Before September Starts? Evaluating The $0.00001 Projection However, amidst this turbulent market atmosphere, there is a glimmer of hope, especially after Grayscale‚Äôs win in its lawsuit against the SEC.

16852988,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549682,1693558850,How Bitcoin And Crypto Are Impacted By The Fed‚Äôs Growing War Chest: Report,"In a recent report by Capriole Investments‚Äô Charles Edwards explored the Federal Reserve‚Äôs ever-expanding war chest and its potential implications for the Bitcoin and crypto market. As Bitcoin gears up for its halving in April 2024, a pivotal event that will make it scarcer than gold, understanding the macroeconomic environment becomes crucial. Why Macro Matters For Bitcoin And Crypto Edwards underscores the inherent interconnectedness of global markets, asserting, ‚ÄúBigger markets drive smaller markets.‚Äù This symbiotic relationship is evident in the crypto realm, where altcoins‚Äô performance is closely tethered to Bitcoin‚Äôs movements. Drawing a parallel with traditional markets, Edwards elucidates, ‚ÄúBonds drive equities, equities drive Bitcoin and Bitcoin drives altcoins.‚Äù Contrary to the prevailing sentiment of an impending recession in 2023, the equities market defied expectations with a robust rally. This surge was not arbitrary but was propelled by the groundbreaking integration of usable AI, which has the potential to significantly augment GDP. Edwards directs attention to the NAAIM Exposure Index, a barometer of NAAIM managers‚Äô equities exposure. The current readings of this index are reminiscent of those in June and October 2022, both of which signaled local bottoms for the S&P 500. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Cryptos Poised For Final Surge Before US Recession, Here‚Äôs Why Furthermore, the AAII sentiment survey results, which are currently moderate, could provide a more convincing buy signal if they align with the NAAIM Exposure Index. Another metric that Edwards holds in high regard is the Put/Call ratio. This ratio offers insights into the relative bullishness or bearishness of market participants in the options market. A recent spike in this ratio suggests that the traditional finance market might be on the cusp of a near-term upward movement, Bitcoin and crypto could follow. However, Edwards tempers this optimism with a note of caution. For a more definitive bullish signal, the S&P 500 would need to breach and sustain above the pivotal monthly resistance level at 4600. A consistent performance above this threshold would dispel any notions of a transient ‚Äúdead-cat-bounce.‚Äù Macro Fundamentals: A Mixed Bag The broader macroeconomic picture presents a mosaic of varying hues. The aggressive tightening cycle, a hallmark of the Fed‚Äôs recent monetary policy, is still being assimilated by the markets. With the reservoir of household savings accumulated during the Corona stimulus years now running dry, a consequential contraction in consumer spending is on the horizon. Edwards shines a spotlight on a couple of particularly disconcerting metrics: a marked decline in manufacturing, a sector whose downturns have historically been harbingers of recessions and consumer spending, which has not only dipped below its 20-year average growth rate but has done so at an alarming velocity. Other red flags in the US economic landscape include a relative rise in the cost of living as income growth, at a meager 1% annually, lags behind inflation; an unprecedented credit card debt mountain of $1 trillion; escalating delinquency rates; and a squeeze on net worth as housing prices wane in the face of dwindling demand. Yet, despite these ominous signs, the robust employment rates render any immediate proclamations of a recession premature. Edwards emphasizes the significance of the ‚Äúinitial claims‚Äù metric as a bellwether for unemployment trends. Related Reading: Bloomberg Analysts Raises Approval Chances Of Spot Bitcoin ETF To 75% However, the integration of AI into the workforce is not just a technological marvel but a potential economic game-changer. Edwards, drawing from personal experience, notes a 50% surge in productivity with AI‚Äôs aid. He references a statement by Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, which projects that in the near future, a single programmer, with tools like ChatGPT and Copilot, could rival the productivity of 20-30 of today‚Äôs programmers. The Fed‚Äôs War Chest Aware of the looming economic uncertainties, the Federal Reserve has been bolstering its defenses. The unprecedented rate hikes, catapulting interest rates from zero to 5% in a mere year, coupled with a contraction in the money supply rate, have engendered the most stringent economic conditions ever recorded that has been weighing heavy on tradfi, Bitcoin and crypto. The Fed‚Äôs dual strategy of high interest rates, which provide leeway to slash rates during crises, and its recent success in paring down its balance sheet by a whopping $1trillion, are central to its defensive posture. Edwards speculates on the timing of the next QE round, suggesting that given the impending election year, the Fed might be compelled to deploy its liquidity arsenal sooner than anticipated. Given the current macroeconomic tableau and the 90% of rate hikes already factored into the market as per the CME FedWatch, Edwards posits that the Fed might be compelled to infuse liquidity in the imminent future, especially if indicators like rising unemployment or plummeting consumer spending manifest. What will happen then should be clear to everyone: risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto will rally, aligning perfectly with the BTC halving. At press time, BTC traded at $26,015.

However, it has now lost these gains as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chose to delay its decisions on seven Spot ETF applications. Bitcoin Crashes Below $26,000 Bitcoin dropped by over 4% to $26,000 as the SEC extended the timeline to decide on the ETF applications of BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity, Valkyrie, VanEck, and Bitwise. Related Reading: Dogecoin And Bitcoin Become Latest Additions To Robinhood Wallet This price action contrasts with when the cryptocurrency had reacted positively to the news of Grayscale‚Äôs victory, with the US Court of Appeals ruling in favor of the asset manager against the Commission. Many had looked forward to the SEC‚Äôs decision in these ETF applications following Grayscale‚Äôs victory, hoping that the legal loss would have softened the regulator into approving these applications. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas had stated earlier that he would not be ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù if the SEC delayed these applications. According to him, these timelines may not matter as much as the SEC is still likely to ‚Äúgive in‚Äù at some point, and we will eventually see the approval of these applications. Following this extension, the SEC will have another 45 days to review these applications and choose whether to approve, deny, or delay its decision. The regulator also has a maximum of 240 days to decide whether or not to approve or disapprove these applications. However, it has several key deadlines in between. BTC price falls below $26,000 following SEC decision | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com What‚Äôs Next For BTC? Many have projected the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF as one of the key events that could spark a significant surge in Bitcoin‚Äôs price (as we saw how the market reacted following Grayscale‚Äôs victory). However, the SEC‚Äôs decision to delay these applications shows that it is not ready to back down just yet, and there could be continued resistance to approving a Spot Bitcoin ETF. While the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF remains uncertain, Bitcoin may be hanging in the red throughout this month. According to historical data, September has always been known to be bearish for Bitcoin‚Äôs price as the digital asset has closed in the red most times at the end of September.

Token withdrawals out of the Shibarium bridge are now live and available to users, weeks after a much-hyped launch quickly fizzled out after being riddled with software bugs that led to millions of dollars in limbo on the network.  Nearly 100,000 transactions took place on August 31, data from blockchain explorers show, with a peak activity of 132,000 transactions on August 25. As of Friday, users can use shib (SHIB), bone (BONE), and other tokens on Shibarium to swap tokens, lend and borrow capital or stake tokens to earn rewards.  As such, the locked value on Shibarium is just $1.26 million, suggesting the average user is deploying little capital to the layer 2 network. This is less than 1% of the $35 billion locked across various blockchains in the crypto ecosystem, data shows.  Elsewhere, an unknown SHIB whale - a colloquial term for a large holder of any asset - moved nearly $38 million worth of the tokens in an unusual move early Friday. Transactional data shows the whale first moved $160,000 in SHIB, and then $37.4 million in SHIB, to a new wallet on Ethereum.  Tracking holder movements could be crucial for some traders as transfers to an exchange may signal selling pressure ahead, while transfers to a DeFi protocol could mean growth for that protocol‚Äôs token.

42419686,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFNkr,1693531800,"OKX Planning Web3 Foray Into India, Chief Marketing Officer Says","OKX, one of the 10 largest crypto exchanges by trading volume, is planning to enter India and recruit local employees to explore potential Web3 applications, the firm's chief marketing officer told CoinDesk on Wednesday.  The company, which doesn't have a global headquarters, has regional hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai and the Bahamas. It plans to scale up its wallet services ""exponentially"" by tapping into India's much-talked-about developer community, Haider Rafique said in an interview. Currently, OKX has about 200,000 wallet users in India, which is only 5% of the nation's Web3 users, he added.  ""We are not going to come in and cowboy this thing,"" he said. ""We're going to learn about the community. We're going to work with local folks. Figure out where we can add value.""  Crypto isn't banned in India, and isn't exactly legal either. The nation has not brought forward any legislation in parliament for Web3 or cryptocurrency issues, but has imposedstiff taxes on trading and implemented anti-money laundering rules. Some plans to include Web3 in India's digital story are afoot. The central bank continues to oppose legalizing cryptocurrency while promoting its central bank digital currency (CBDC). And as G20 president, the country has pushed for global rules for crypto.  The stifling regulatory environment has kept most global cryptocurrency exchanges away from India. Of the 10 most-downloaded trading apps in the country, six are from international exchanges, according to data from AppTweak. And one of those is Coinbase (COIN), whose trading operation was suspended within three days of its launch. India's politicians have been asking the Web3 industry to decouple itself from crypto.  ""You have to kind of separate Web3 from CeFi [centralized finance] and I think regulators are starting to do that too,"" Rafique said. ""They're more concerned about venues that have fiat on-ramps, which we do but we don't offer it in India. Once India comes up with a regulatory framework for crypto then we would like to be the front runners.""  OKX does not have an office in the nation and has no immediate plan to open one because that's not required to offer Web3 services, said Rafique. But it is looking to hire a team to lead this effort.  ""We're trying to identify who's who in the zoo and what is their contribution. There's a large developer community. How do we help them, build a relationship with them,"" he said. ""How do we first let them know what we're about. And then work with these communities to figure out what is the right way in. Is it for us to sponsor Web3 conferences or developer conferences or host an OKX Blockchain Week? This is what we are exploring.""  Recently OKX partnered with blockchain platform Neo for its APAC Hackathon in the southern city of Bengaluru, which Haider said is a test to validate their assumptions, understand the culture and support the ecosystem.

16825817,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549657,1693526402,Base TVL Surges By 76% Amidst New DeFi Protocol Hype,"Base, an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) network developed by prominent cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, has seen its total value locked (TVL) soar to new heights on Friday, August 31. This surge was triggered by the recent launch and growing hype around the decentralized exchange (DEX) platform Aerodrome. Total Value Locked on Base Reach $333 Million The total decentralized finance (DeFi) deposits on Base have hit a new all-time high following a nearly 76% spurt in the past 24 hours. According to data from DefiLlama, the network‚Äôs TVL currently stands at $346.39 million, jumping from $196.8 million a day ago. Total Value Locked on the Base network | Source: DefiLlama This sharp rise has seen Base leap into the top ten blockchains with the largest TVL, sitting above Solana in ninth position. However, Ethereum remains the dominant network in the decentralized finance space, with a total value of roughly $22.1 billion. üí• BREAKING: Total Value Locked on @BuildOnBase has surpassed $300M and entered the top 10 blockchains with the largest TVL üîµüöÄ pic.twitter.com/KC7tClvA1g ‚Äî Base Daily (@BaseDailyTK) August 31, 2023 Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Uptrend Support And Could Aim Fresh Rally To $1,800 Interestingly, this latest feat only underscores the overall progress of Base since opening its doors to the public on August 9, 2023. The Coinbase-incubated network‚Äôs TVL has swelled more than 733% since the public mainnet launch. One of the notable catalysts of the Base‚Äôs growth was the short-lived hype of the social media platform Friend.tech. However, activity on the decentralized app has since hit a snag, with trading fees dipping by more than 94%. Aerodrome Drives An Inflow Of $170 Million To Base As earlier mentioned, the latest resurgence in Base‚Äôs DeFi deposits was triggered by the growing interest in the Aerodrome protocol, which recently launched on the blockchain. Aerodrome is a decentralized exchange developed by the team behind Velodrome, a popular DEX on the Optimism chain. The platform rewards users who provide liquidity and participate in protocol governance with its native token, AERO. Related Reading: Coinbase (COIN) And Bitcoin-Related Stocks Soar Following Grayscale‚Äôs Victory Thanks to the AERO emissions, which began on August 30, Aerodrome has attracted more than $170 million in value to the Base network. Meanwhile, this has reflected a significant 6,000% rise in the protocol‚Äôs TVL in the past 24 hours. Despite the initial negative sentiment brewing around Base due to the BALD rug pull, and various DeFi protocol exploits, it appears that major cryptocurrency projects are continuing to expand to the layer 2 network. PancakeSwap, the second-largest decentralized exchange, is one of the protocols to have recently joined the trend. The DeFi platform went live on the Base network on Thursday, 30th of August.
