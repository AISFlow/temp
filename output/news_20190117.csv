42430137,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRSPh,1547765117,ConsenSys Invests in Two Crypto Startups to Lead VCs Into Ethereum Ecosystem,"Despite recent belt-tightening at Brooklyn-based ethereum venture studio ConsenSys, the company’s investment arm is ramping up outreach to independent startups.  ConsensSys Ventures, headed by managing partner Kavita Gupta, announced two new investments on Thursday: $1 million in the Paris-based crypto wallet and trading platform Coinhouse and an undisclosed amount in the encryption-centric browser Tenta.  Gupta told CoinDesk these companies distinguished themselves with teams that include bitcoin veterans serving established user-bases. According to Coinhouse, the platform has over 150,000 user accounts. Plus, the startup’s CEO, Nicolas Louvet, was an early investor in the hardware wallet startup Ledger. Ledger CEO Éric Larchevêque was a reciprocal investor in Coinhouse and both men now sit on the boards of each other's respective companies.  “A settlement custody solution [Ledger] working with the exchange [Coinhouse] ... is very relevant to how at ConsenSys Ventures we think about investing,” Gupta told CoinDesk in an interview Thursday.  As for Tenta, which features a built-in VPN, ad blocker and full data encryption, Tenta CEO Jesse Adams told CoinDesk the browser currently has 900,000 downloads. The ConsenSys-incubated wallet startup MetaMask is already in talks with Tenta regarding how the latter’s mobile browser could include built-in crypto wallets.  “Our mission to make private and secure browsing fast and ubiquitous received a huge boost with ConsenSys support to expand to other platforms while continuing to innovate great new privacy features,"" Adams said in a statement.  ConsenSys Ventures was launched in 2017 with $50 million to invest in startups that would complement those under the main ConsenSys umbrella, with a similar mission to help build the ethereum ecosystem. Since then, Gupta said her seven-person team at ConsenSys Ventures has distributed roughly $14.5 million across 14 projects, noting there are still a few more equity deals in the final stages of completion.  Those deals involve early-stage projects that graduated from the inaugural cohort of the ConsenSys accelerator program Tachyon, which took place in San Francisco in 2018. Gupta said her fund will allow the teams to raise from outside venture firms and then match that valuation to buy 7 percent of the equity, as just one example of the type of deals in progress.  As such, Gupta’s strategy is to bring as many traditional venture capitalists into ConsenSys’ orbit as possible, to benefit from their experience with mainstream tech products.  “We have been helping a lot of VC funds to think through their investment thesis and introduce them to the ecosystem,” she said, adding:  “In a lot of our investment deals lately, we have invited a lot of our friends and other funds who we respect, and they have participated.”  VC synergy  Indeed, ConsenSys Venture’s portfolio now shares mutual investments with Coinbase Ventures, Intel Capital, Sequoia, General Catalyst, Kindred Ventures, Betaworks, 122 West, La Famiglia and Paradigm, just to name a few.  For Coinhouse, Gupta’s team led a $2.8 million Series A with additional funding from Digital Currency Group, XAnge Siparex Innovation, and BTU Protocol Ecosystem Fund, along with several angel investors. (Full disclosure: DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.)  Meanwhile, more than 60 applications are already rolling in for the upcoming Berlin-based Tachyon program this year. Gupta said more than 200 projects applied for the first cohort and she expects there to be an equal number for Berlin by the time applications close in February.  More than anything, Gupta said the first Tachyon program taught her team about what they are looking for in an investment. Namely, they want startups that are able to raise capital and run businesses on their own, without solely relying on the pocketbook of ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin.  “We will invite more founders from both sides of the community to talk about being an entrepreneur, raising money,” Gupta said. “We are inviting 10–12 founders who had really good exits from their company, really good Series B raises, to talk about that experience.”  In a sense, this is consistent with the old ConsenSys strategy, which relied on partnerships within Lubin’s network and viewed portfolio companies as strategic partners. For example, several ConsenSys-incubated projects became the first users to test the loans facilitated by the portfolio company BlockFi. Sometimes portfolio companies work directly with ConsenSys teams for consulting and building products, whether the results stay in-house at ConsenSys proper or later translate to the external portfolio company.  “It’s very close-knit,” Gupta said. “They [Coinhouse] will also be working with any other exchange products, wallet products, custody and settlement solutions that have been incubated by ConsenSys.”  Going forward Gupta says she’s looking to prioritize investments in startups that focus on three things: infrastructure, privacy and network effects.  Speaking about ethereum at-large, she added:  “For us, we want to focus on what is going to drive adoption.”  Kavita Gupta at Tachyon Demo Day 2018 image via ConsenSys Ventures",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | WALLET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/17/consensys-invests-in-two-crypto-startups-to-lead-vcs-into-ethereum-ecosystem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d477e4b137013eb3dcfb96b869bb935b9bc2ea8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Joining Coinbase was a no-brainer for a number [of] reasons including its commitment to establishing an open financial system and the strength of its engineering team,"" Blockspring announced on its blog this week.  CoinDesk confirmed the acquisition with a Coinbase spokesperson, though the company declined to comment further.  The San Francisco-based Blockspring makes it easy to pull data from various APIs into Excel and Google Sheets. The startup had been backed by Y Combinator and a $3.4 million funding round from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and SV Angel in 2015.  Still with a16z at the time, Blockspring found an early advocate in current Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan.  ""Blockspring turns a company’s business users into an army of engineers able to quickly and easily connect spreadsheets and other applications to web services without any coding experience,"" said Srinivasan, according to Blockspring's 2015 funding announcement.  More recently, Blockspring had built an integration for Coinbase into its service.    Excited to share that the @Blockspring team is joining Coinbase to help build out our developer tools. They’ve built an impressive platform that connects hundreds of different APIs and we’re excited for them to continue their work here at Coinbase!        — Tim Wagner (@timallenwagner) January 16, 2019      According to the company's acquisition announcement, ""Blockspring will continue to operate as an independent company and our products will continue to operate for current and new customers.""

On Jan. 10, Xu (under his real name Xu Mingxing) filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) for approval to buy a 60 percent stake in a construction engineering firm called LEAP Holdings Group Ltd.  Through his company OKC Holdings Corp., Xu is aiming to purchase approximately 3.2 billion shares of the company for HK$0.15 (around $0.02) per share. In total, the acquisition, if approved, would cost more than $60 million.  To avoid the news affecting LEAP Holdings' stock price, the firm is currently suspended on the HKEX.  While the effort has yet to be approved by the stock exchange, the successful purchase of the stake could provide a route for OKCoin to become a public company in Hong Kong via a back-door listing. That is, rather than go through the process of applying for an initial public listing (IPO) and jumping through all the necessary regulatory hoops, they would simply buy a firm already listed in Hong Kong.  Last August, crypto exchange Huobi took a similar step, becoming the largest shareholder of a HKEX-listed firm called Pantronics Holdings for around $70 million.  Other major firms in the crypto space, specifically mining companies Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang, have filed for IPOs in the same jurisdiction, but seem to be making little progress with the HKEX. Canaan has now let its application expire, while the HKEX is ""hesitant"" to approve the offering for other mining giants.  A Bloomberg report early this month suggested that Canaan is now seeking to IPO in New York, but nothing has been officially made public to date.  Wolfie Zhao contributed reporting.

42430140,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRSTh,1547740823,QuadrigaCX Crypto Exchange Users Still Can't Get Their Money Out,"QuadrigaCX customers are complaining they still can't get their money out more than a month after the cryptocurrency exchange won a court dispute that had held up $19 million of funds.  While that would be worrisome enough, users' concerns were compounded by the company's announcement Monday that its CEO and founder, Gerald Cotten, had died more than a month earlier.  In a statement  attributed to Jennifer Robertson, Cotten's wife, the exchange said he died on December 9 from complications arising from Crohn's disease while traveling in India. The same statement also said QuadrigaCX was working through a backlog of withdrawal requests and had set daily withdrawal limits.  Then, on Tuesday, QuadrigaCX sent its customers an email, a copy of which CoinDesk obtained, stating that it was processing withdrawals ""slowly"" and that the team is ""actively working on having the funds deposited and distributed.""  ""While we don't have a specific update pertaining to this situation, our goal was to resolve this issue within the next two weeks and we remain committed to that goal,"" says the email, which was signed by Aaron Matthews, QuadrigaCX's interim president and CEO.  QuadrigaCX user and Canadian resident Xitong Zou told CoinDesk that he had filed multiple support tickets in recent weeks and received a response saying the withdrawal could take a week or two each time. ""If only the [QuadrigaCX] customer support were better I think it could go a long way, and it's not like they aren't active,"" he said.  ""I see them on Reddit and Facebook and Twitter answering minor questions about cash pickup times etc., but they don't answer any of the big questions we have regarding the CEO's recent death,"" he wrote in an email, adding:  ""The fact that it happened a month ago, and they just announced it now, and no proof of death, no obituary, no linkedin profiles of any of the staff, no physical addresses, limited crypto withdrawal limits, etc all makes people suspicious.""  As a result, ""there's a bunch of warning bells going off in most people's heads right now,"" Zou said.  QuadrigaCX did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  When contacted by CoinDesk, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, the government agency that manages diplomatic relations, appeared to confirm QuadrigaCX's account of Cotten's death overseas, but did not mention his name or give a date.  ""Our thoughts and sympathies are with the loved ones of a Canadian who recently died while visiting India,"" said the spokesperson, Sylvain Leclerc. ""We are providing assistance to the family at this very difficult time.""  Leclerc said he could not disclose any further information, citing Canadian privacy law, and did not answer follow-up questions by press time.  When reached by phone, a spokesperson for the Indian Bureau of Immigration was unable to confirm that Cotten had been in the country.  Banking bottlenecks  QuadrigaCX blamed the withdrawal backlog on its recently resolved court dispute with theCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), which froze funds held by the exchange's payment processor, Costodian, Inc., over concerns about their origin.  While the Ontario Superior Court of Justice briefly took custody of these funds last year, Judge Glenn Hainey released the majority of them back – $70,000 in U.S. dollars and $25 million in Canadian dollars (about $19 million USD), less $200,000 that was withheld, according to a court document published in December.  These funds were then frozen by the processor's new bank, the Bank of Montreal, according to a statement by the exchange on Reddit.  A subsequent update stated that the bank had released the funds, but said there would be another delay while Billerfy, a payment processor, endorsed the bank drafts.  When reached by CoinDesk, Billerfly managing director and owner José Reyes said the company had finished endorsing the drafts ""but no banks have the appetite to take the drafts so we are looking around for crypto-friendly banks that will take the drafts so we can use it to payout clients. Even lawyers are having a hard time getting a bank.""  When asked if that meant customer withdrawals would remain delayed until a banking partner could be found, Reyes responded:  ""Yes. Hope not long. We are really working very hard to work with crypto-friendly banks.""  Billerfy and Costodian are both owned by Reyes, and were all listed as parties in the now-concluded legal fight.  Long delays  A number of QuadrigaCX customers have been complaining about withdrawal issues on social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter, with most claiming long delays – some several weeks or even months long – in receiving funds.  Some users even say their open tickets on the exchange were marked as ""complete,"" despite the fact that they had not received their funds.  (A few users claimed they did receive funds on Reddit, though they were outnumbered by the number of posts listing issues or concerns.)  Some withdrawal attempts were met with a ""failed to send"" message, a problem that interim president Matthews addressed in his Tuesday email to customers.  He wrote:    ""Regarding failed withdrawal notice to customers,      Your pending withdrawal has not failed, it was canceled back to your account. Please restart your withdrawal according to the new limits set out by QuadrigaCX on January 14, 2019.""    He later added that all withdrawals ""will occur in the advertised timeframes"" of two weeks.  Moving forward  Once the exchange has caught up on its backlog, QuadrigaCX hopes it ""will return to normal operating levels regarding withdrawals and punctual timelines,"" Matthews wrote.  As part of this process, the exchange has instituted new withdrawal limits on U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and cryptocurrencies, with different limits for differing levels of customer verification.  ""We did this to ensure service levels don't get to the point where any backlogs or interruptions to banking services happen again,"" Matthews explained.  The exchange will also work to diversify the number of Canadian banks it works with, so as to ensure no single bank can freeze funds like CIBC again.  Unverified customers can withdraw between $5,000 and $10,000 in crypto, while ""level 1 verified"" customers can withdraw as much as $25,000, Matthews noted, concluding:  ""These changes were the result of our efforts to continuously improve our service offering. We will continue to review service levels and make any changes that we feel best serve the interests of our customers. We thank you for your patience and look forward to the resolution of this matter.""  Anna Baydakova contributed reporting.

42430138,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRSLh,1547737251,South Africa’s Central Bank Proposes Rules for Crypto Companies,"Crypto exchanges and wallet providers would have to register with regulators under rules proposed by South Africa’s central bank.  In a consultation paper publishedhttps://www.resbank.co.za/Lists/News%20and%20Publications/Attachments/9037/CAR%20WG%20Consultation%20paper%20on%20crypto%20assets_final.pdf Wednesday, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) said that regulatory action on crypto assets needs to be prioritized to protect consumers and investors, stating that consumers ""are left vulnerable as sellers of crypto assets are not regulated.”  Discussing the possible regulatory approaches that could be taken, and citing the ""reputational risk"" that is faced if mistakes are made, the central bank proposes walking a middle line between doing nothing and stringent regulation or a ban – a level of oversight it describes as ""limited regulation.""  ""At this proposed level, an official body places specific requirements on providers of certain services in respect of crypto assets, without setting predefined conditions for formal authorisation to provide crypto assets-related products or services,"" SARB says.  As such, the bank suggests that a ""useful starting point"" for regulating the space would be the introduction of a registration scheme for crypto asset service providers such as exchanges and wallet providers.  It would follow that with a review of existing rules and how they can be applied to crypto assets, with possible amendments or new rules to follow, and finally a review of the regulatory actions implemented at that point.  “The phased approach, starting with the registration requirement, could lead to formal authorization and designation as a registered/licensed provider for crypto asset services operating in South Africa at a later stage,” SARB states.  The central bank also recommended that crypto assets should remain without legal tender status and should not be recognized as electronic money in its proposal.  A detailed process for registration is expected to be issued and implemented by the first quarter of 2019. Registered crypto entities would also need to report suspicious and unusual cash transactions of 25,000 South African rand (or $1,820) and above, according to the proposed rules.  The central bank's consultation paper is a joint effort with the Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group (IFWG), consisting of several South African regulatory authorities, and is open for public comment until Feb. 15.  Back in April, the South African Revenue Service, the country’s tax agency, said that normal tax rules are applicable to crypto earnings – that is, they may be treated under standard income tax rules, but may be liable for capital gains tax in some cases.

Notable new customers added in 2018 included subscription TV provider Dish Networks, online organization of security experts HackerOne and the U.S. state of Ohio, which became the first state in the nation to allow taxes to be paid in bitcoin back in November.  The firm also added settlement support for bitcoin cash (BCH) and stablecoins from Circle (USDC), Gemini (GUSD) and Paxos (PAX), while its focus still remains on bitcoin (BTC), according to the announcement.  “Bitcoin has the network effect around the world and we are still extremely bullish on bitcoin and the bitcoin ecosystem,” said BitPay head of product Sean Rolland.

42430144,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRSZh,1547722838,Bitcoin Price Volatility Is Down 98% Year-on-Year,"Bitcoin price volatility has crashed in the last 12 months as the bear market killed off the speculative frenzy.  Daily volatility, the spread between the price high and price low, stood at $61 yesterday – down a hefty 98 percent from the figure of $3,468 observed on Jan. 16, 2018 – according to CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, bitcoin's price is also down 74 percent year-on-year. Generally, with a sharp drop in price, volatility in dollar terms tends to fall in parallel.  Notably, volatility was extremely high in percentage terms 12 months ago. The trading range was 26 percent on Jan. 16, 2018, indicating that the crypto market frenzy was at its peak.  Volatility, however, subsided as the year progressed: dropping from $973 in the first quarter to $345, $245 and $195, in the following quarters, respectively. Meanwhile, in percentage terms, average daily volatility fell from 9.14 percent to 3.6 percent over 2018.  This year has begun on a much more calm note. Daily volatility has remained largely below $200 and hit a 2.5-month low of $45.17 on Jan. 12. Many consider the slide in volatility a sign of speculative froth leaving the market and the cryptocurrency nearing a bottom.  It is worth noting that an extended period of low volatility usually ends up paving way for a big move. Therefore, BTC could soon violate the six-day-long trading range of $3,500 to $3,700.  Moreover, a range breakdown looks likely as the long-term technical charts are biased toward the bears. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,585 on Bitstamp.  Weekly chart  As seen above, BTC fell 13 percent last week, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the descending 10-week moving average, currently at $3,919.  The outlook remains bearish as long as BTC is held below the 10-week MA.  4-hour and daily chart  BTC has created a neutral diamond pattern on the 4-hour chart. The prospects of BTC breaking the $3,700-$3,500 range to the downside would rise significantly if the diamond is breached on the lower side.  The relative strength index (RSI) is biased bearish at 41. So, there is plenty scope for a sell-off post-breakdown.  Put simply, the prospects of BTC breaching the $3,700-$3,500 range to the downside would rise significantly if the diamond breakdown is confirmed.  View  BTC is more likely to see a downside break of the $3,700-$3,500 range.  $4,000 would be back on the table if BTC defies the bearish setup on the long term charts with a move above $3,700.

42430132,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRSFh,1547719511,Wyoming Blockchain Bill Proposes Issuance of Tokenized Stock Certificates,"Lawmakers from the U.S. state of Wyoming have introduced legislation that would allow the issuance of tokenized stock certificates using blockchain tech.  On Wednesday, representative Jared Olsen (Republican), along with senator Chris Rothfuss (Democratic) and six other Republican representatives jointly filed House Bill 0185, titled “Corporate stock-certificate tokens,” proposing an amendment that would permit the use of tokenized digital share certificates in lieu of paper-based versions.  “The articles of incorporation or bylaws of a corporation may specify that all or a portion of the shares of the corporation may be represented by share certificates in the form of certificate tokens,” the proposed bill states.  HB0185, if passed, would allow share certificates – which represent ownership of stocks – to be stored in an electronic format and their information to be entered into a blockchain or other auditable database, according to the document. That information then would be “transmitted electronically to the issuing corporation, the person to whom the certificate token was issued and any transferee.”  The tokenized certificates would also be authorized via the network signatures – unique identifying hashes – of two officers or directors of a corporation.  The bill, if passed into law, would come into effect from July 1, 2019, according to the document.  Wyoming has been taking several legislative initiatives around blockchain use cases. Just last week, the state approved a bill to let blockchain startups to operate within a regulatory sandbox for a legislative vote. It also unanimously passed a bill exempting some utility tokens from securities regulations last February.  And, last month, the state's Teton County signed a memorandum of understanding with Medici Land Governance – a subsidiary of Overstock.com’s Medici Ventures – to put its land registry on a distributed ledger.

42402461,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJs8V,1547715636,Barclays and Clearmatics Call on Coders to Help Blockchains Talk to Each Other,"U.K. bank Barclays and London-based startup Clearmatics are inviting coders to come up with ways to connect ethereum with made-for-enterprise blockchains such as Hyperledger Fabric.  The interoperability challenge is being hosted by Clearmatics and will use a template involving its open-source interoperability protocol, Ion. The hackathon will take place at the Barclays Rise fintech hub in London on February 5 and 6.  The importance of addressing interoperability between major enterprise blockchain platforms is reflected by the big names involved: a panel of judges will feature representatives from megabanks Barclays, UBS, HSBC and Santander. (The prizes for the teams that come up with the most impressive solutions have not yet been announced.)  The consulting giant EY will be observing the event and will produce a report based on the findings (a role played by Deloitte in the last Barclays DerivHack.)  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Dr. Lee Braine of Barclays' chief technology office said:  “We would like to gain a greater understanding of the challenges and potential solutions for interoperability between different distributed ledgers. Such interoperability can be complex and this hackathon will permit the industry to experiment with the Ion protocol and also provide feedback to the open source project.”  Stepping back, the enterprise blockchain world has been reduced to about four prominent industry platforms. There are ethereum variants like Quorum, developed by JPMorgan; the Hyperledger family of protocols; R3’s Corda; and the Digital Asset platform.  Unless they can be made to talk to each other, these new systems risk recreating the insular silos they were supposed to replace, undermining the business case for blockchain as an efficiency booster and lubricator of trade. For example, a currency running on ethereum can’t easily be swapped for a stock or bond tracked on Hyperledger without a way for each chain to verify the transaction on the other. On the other hand, a monolithic blockchain would undercut the purported benefit of decentralization.  Sara Feenan, product strategist at Clearmatics pointed out that a single governing system “really creates a single point of failure and a single point of trust. Nor do we want something that is a coin or a token and have to exchange it at some point during the journey.”  In particular, she said, interoperability between Hyperledger Fabric and ethereum variants is important, not only because of the weight Fabric carries in the enterprise space, but also thanks to the growing ties between the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) and the Hyperleder Foundation.  “We [Clearmatics] are members of the EEA and there is now this narrative of Hyperledger and EEA becoming associate members of one another at the end of last year,” Feenan said.  Braine said Barclays will submit a team of its own engineers to address the challenge, but they will take a slightly different tack by attempting to use Ion for interoperability between ethereum and Corda.  Ion the prize  Clearmatics, which is the technology provider to the Utility Settlement Coin consortium of banks, has previously shown how its Ion protocol can foster interoperability.  In May of last year,  Ion helped a blockchain-based derivative to be originated on ethereum-based Clearmatics and settled on the Axoni blockchain, which is also a fork of ethereum.  Chris Chung, blockchain engineer at Clearmatics, said the “grand vision for Ion is interoperability with everything,” adding that research into interoperation with Hyperledger Fabric started late last year.  The USC project, which aims to create a risk-free tokenized asset backed by cash collateral at the central  bank, is also an important driver, said Chung, adding:  “We want to ensure that USC does reach the broadest kind of possible applications of the target settlement. This puts a lot of weight on Ion as the interoperability framework to widen the gateway to access of USC.”  Interoperability solutions would facilitate so-called atomic swaps – cross-chain transactions where either both sides of the trade are completed at the same time, or neither is. Braine envisioned the tech being applied first to relatively simple financial products like foreign exchange (FX) trades before taking on “incremental complexity.”  “Starting with perhaps an FX payment versus payment (PvP) with two different currencies, I can imagine the next steps,” he said. This could then lead to delivery-versus-payment (DvP) – where a non-cash asset such as a security is exchanged for money.  “As many have highlighted in the past, existing domestic payment systems are quite efficient; the real value of these types of protocols comes when you have more complex products that benefit from atomic swaps because you are then able to achieve the faster settlement with reduced risk,” said Braine.  Driving home the need for blockchains to talk to each other, John Whelan, head of digital investment banking at Santander, compared that to the way that enterprises work with multiple operating systems today.  “There is no doubt we will live in an environment where we will have multiple operating systems, if you want to use that analogy,” he said. “And those operating systems will need to be interoperable with each other just like they are today, whether it's Android versus Windows versus MacOS etc.”  Barclays image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/17/barclays-and-clearmatics-call-on-coders-to-help-blockchains-talk-to-each-other,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1e3bd8e8cec72349e82b13c56b6eebd45b261ef-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402463,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJs9U,1547694306,"One Year Later, What's Holding Back SegWit Adoption on Bitcoin?","It’s been over a year since the scaling upgrade known as segregated witness, or SegWit, was activated on the bitcoin network.  Even so, only an estimated 36 percent of all bitcoin transactions are actually using it.  Why the minimal adoption rate? It's largely because, like any backward-compatible upgrade (otherwise called a soft fork), SegWit ensures participants in the bitcoin network that haven’t upgraded to the same software can still follow the same network only under a slightly less-restricted ruleset.  As a result, some bitcoin businesses and exchanges have put off making the switch to enable SegWit transactions despite the low-fee advantage that it presents when sending bitcoin payments.  “Some of the [venture capital]-backed companies don’t care about paying bitcoin fees,” said Rusty Russell, a developer for blockchain technology firm Blockstream. ""They can burn a million dollars a week on bitcoin fees and nobody really cares because what they care about is user adoption numbers.""  Calling the switch to optimize operations for SegWit an “engineering-level” decision, Russell told CoinDesk back in December that due to a significant decline in total transaction fees since the beginning of 2018 the priority at present for startups is “optimizing for growth” – not “implementing cool new tech.”  Still, both Russell and Aaron Lasher, the chief strategy officer at bitcoin wallet company BRD, suspect that pressure for SegWit adoption will increase for businesses in the event of a bitcoin price increase.  As Lasher told CoinDesk last November:  “We don’t feel the pressure right now to implement SegWit because it doesn’t make a huge difference but it will during the next price run-up. I don’t know if that’s going to be one year, three years or five years but I’m quite sure it will happen.”  Lasher conceded that it was no easy feat to change backend code to recognize, send and receive SegWit transactions.  “There’s just a lot of mechanics that you have to be thoughtful about,"" he said. ""It’s people’s money. The default thing to do is to do nothing because it works already and you’re not risking your customers’ funds.""  To Lasher's point, Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, said in an open Q&A forum on Reddit earlier this month that retrofitting exchange wallets for SegWit was a ""very tricky"" procedure requiring building ""a new hot wallet from the ground up.""  While not yet released for bitcoin, Winklevoss promised migration to the new wallet system in Q1 of this year.  And the sooner the better in Russell's point of view who advises businesses and exchanges to think proactively.  “Frankly, at some point when fees do go up if there are businesses that do not support segwit, people screaming about fees will obviously take their business somewhere else to someone who has done the work [to support segwit],” said Russell to CoinDesk.  Miner incentives  Approaching the release of SegWit back in August 2017, fundamental disagreements created competing parties that envisioned divergent use cases for the world's first cryptocurrency.  Indeed, since 2017, the segment of the bitcoin community that disapproved of SegWit has focused its efforts around an alternative cryptocurrency called bitcoin cash (now referenced on some exchanges as Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV due to a recent chain split).  While there are bitcoin mining firms that were formerly vocally opposed to SegWit activation – notably, hardware giant Bitmain – the financial incentives for miners to validate SegWit-enabled transactions are now difficult to ignore.  With SegWit-enabled transactions making up nearly 40 percent of the bitcoin network, it means that transactions deliberately excluded for ideological reasons would reduce the total mining reward doled out to miners for validating a new block.  Speaking to what he concedes are purely “ideological differences,” David Steinberg – vice president of Random Crypto, the analytics company that built a calculator showing mining ""unprofitability"" – explained to CoinDesk in a previous interview that in his view:  “SegWit adds additional rules and removes one rule from bitcoin, which is that you can only spend money that you have. It's not that it doesn't enforce it. It just enforces it in a different way that many, including myself, feel is less secure.”  But Steinberg agreed with Lasher that differences in opinion over SegWit are not primary factors currently dissuading SegWit adoption.  At least from the vantage point of the bitcoin mining community, Steinberg said, “a more obvious reason for why miners may want to exclude SegWit transactions would be AsicBoost.”  “A pretty good guess”  AsicBoost, described as a “mathematical trick,” is a mining firmware that enables bitcoin miners to perform the computations necessary to create new blocks and verify transactions on the blockchain up to 20 percent faster than average speeds.  The technology, patented by Bitcoin Core developer Timo Hanke and Sergio Demian Lerner in 2014, was recently made publicly available for all miners to use under the Blockchain Defensive Patent License.  However, in order to use the firmware without license or detection, miners must deploy an alternative version of the technology called “covert AsicBoost” that is incompatible with SegWit for reasons to do with how SegWit payments are written and rearranged on blocks.  As such, back in late October 2018, when bitcoin mining pool Antpool was seen to exclude SegWit-enabled transactions for a period of roughly one week, certain proponents of the bitcoin community harped back to old allegations against Bitmain – which operates Antpool – for secretly attempting to deploy the firmware.  Calling that “a pretty good guess” as to what may have been going on, former Bitcoin Core developer and applied cryptography consultant Peter Todd said that, at the end of the day, nothing could be ascertained for certain.  He told CoinDesk in a former interview that:  ""You can make assumptions about it. You don’t actually know. Miners could be doing something very different from what you think they're doing. All you know is the output of that process.""  Steinberg contended that, in his view, using “any sort of innovation in the field is fair game” for a mining pool to deploy given the decentralized nature of bitcoin and the technology as a whole.  “There's newer processes coming out from chip manufacturing relatively frequently and people are getting more precise with the equipment that's being produced,"" Steinberg said. ""I think that having an advantage is totally fair.""  Two types of SegWit  But given the ever-increasing number of SegWit transactions, covert AsicBoost and other hardware-related innovations incompatible with SegWit are unlikely to remain advantageous for profit-driven miners.  Seeing mass adoption of SegWit as a slow but inevitable reality, Blockstream developer Russell explained to CoinDesk that, in his view, technology proliferates “in 10- to 25-year cycles” making it “still very early” in the SegWit adoption game.  But, in an effort to speed up this process of adoption, Lasher and other BRD executives launched a website last September titled “WhenSegwit” featuring “an open letter to those who love bitcoin.”  In the letter, they pleaded with both business and users to prioritize SegWit-optimized services and “get SegWit to 100 percent” adoption.  Seeing slow SegWit adoption as mainly an “incentive problem,” Lasher told CoinDesk that the real goal of the WhenSegWit site was about promoting the adoption of ""the best version of SegWit.”  With SegWit affecting the weight of transactions, businesses and exchanges require upgrading software such that users are able to send and receive SegWit-enabled bitcoin transactions from a string of 26 to 35 alphanumeric characters.  This can be done in two different ways. First, businesses can reuse an older upgrade that has been around since 2012 called the pay to script hash (P2SH).  P2SH was originally a way to compress complicated payment conditions attached to bitcoin transactions but was later leveraged by developers to ensure interoperability between addresses that don’t support SegWit transactions and those that do.  What Lasher calls the “better” version of SegWit is exclusively interoperable with those businesses and users that have upgraded their software to read a SegWit-exclusive address format created by Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell. That version is known as Bech32.  Speaking the SegWit “language”  Bech32 is a bit complicated.  It's currently “not recommended for use until more software supports the format,” according to Bitcoin Wiki. It's a more difficult implementation of SegWit to enable. That said, Bech32 is actually more efficient than P2SH.  That's because, unlike Bech32, which launched last February, P2SH is a repurposed upgrade from 2012 that was not natively engineered to support SegWit. As such, the later upgrade actually processes SegWit transactions in a more roundabout fashion than Bech32.  As Russell explained:  “With [Bech32] you don’t have the first jump. You don’t have the P2SH to SegWit commit. You just have, 'Here’s SegWit.' So it is more efficient instead of going, 'Here’s P2SH,' and then when you spend it, 'Oh yeah, here’s SegWit.'”  And precisely for its backward-incompatibility, Lasher says the “initial tension” of switching over to Bech32 can be thought of as a positive force to further incentivize businesses and exchanges to upgrade their bitcoin software.  “Imagine if you’re an exchange and half of your customers are giving you this weird address and they won’t give you anything else, saying that if you want their business you gotta [start supporting Bech32],” Lasher said. ""Then you’re going to do it.""  Describing the process like learning a new “language” such as Greek, Lasher contended that “this incompatibility issue where everyone needs to learn how to speak Greek” remains one of the major reasons still hindering widespread SegWit adoption.  He concluded:  “Everyone knows they need to but being the first to do it doesn’t really help you. You actually just want to be the last one to do it once everyone else has done it already.""
