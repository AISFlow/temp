42378293,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhiZ,1440794711,Canadian Pension Fund's Venture Arm Exploring Bitcoin Investments,"The venture arm of a major Canadian pension fund is reportedly looking at making investments in bitcoin and blockchain startups.  The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, or OMERS, is one of Canada's largest municipal pension funds. The fund's venture arm, OMERS Ventures, recently disclosed in a recent interview with Canadian business publication TechVibes that it was exploring the use of proceeds from a recently closed $260m CAD fund to make investments in the bitcoin space.  The fund has also drawn support from the Bank of Montreal and Cisco Investments.  Managing director Jim Orlando said during the interview:  ""Cybersecurity is another area we have been looking at, specifically in FinTech as Sid mentioned, and in particular what bitcoin and block chain capability bring in terms of differentiated opportunities. We hope to find a couple of investments for Fund II related to bitcoin and the block chain, and the security side of that whole paradigm.""  OMERS Ventures indicated earlier this week on its website that it would place a heavy emphasis on financial tech companies, including those in the bitcoin space. An infographic published by the firm included a number of bitcoin startups based in Canada.

42378303,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhsd,1440788467,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Kingpins and Dark Markets,"Despite a few high-profile stories, the bitcoin and blockchain industry ended the calendar summer on a down note, with media outlets mostly rehashing well-worn stories.  Still, the notoriety of the publications providing coverage was of note, with The New Yorker and Rolling Stone adding to the conversation and exposing new audiences to topics such as the ongoing bitcoin fork debate and the fall of Mt Gox.  Elsewhere, perceived issues with the technology were given ample airtime, with the dark web and controversial international markets garnering the remainder of the spotlight.  A bitcoin kingpin  Disgraced bitcoin exchange Mt Gox was the subject of an exposé for Rolling Stone in its latest edition, perhaps a testament to the enduring notoriety of bitcoin in the US counterculture.  The article marks the second time the US magazine has profiled a story relating to the bitcoin industry, following a February feature on Silk Road.  In the latest piece, David Kushner tackled the topic with typical Rolling Stone flair, labelling Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles a ""bullied geek"" who ""forged an empire out of digital currency, and became a suspect in a half-billion-dollar heist"".  Kushner further described Karpeles as ""the accidental emperor of bitcoin"". He continued:  ""A hapless geek who, as much to his own surprise as others', became the most powerful lord of digital cash. During his reign, bitcoin, the leading form of virtual currency, rose in value from approximately a quarter to more than $1,200.""  Noting the early success of the bitcoin exchange, the author cites various sources, including Tyler Winklevoss – famed for filing a lawsuit against Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg with his twin brother Cameron Winklevoss – who said Mt Gox was ""the most powerful and prominent property in bitcoin"".  After rendering a detailed history of both bitcoin and the Mt Gox case, Kushner added:  ""Throughout my time with Karpeles in Tokyo, he maintained his innocence with such calm that I was left with two possible conclusions. He's either the greatest criminal mastermind of the digital age or an overeager chump who got in way over his head, and, perhaps, resorted to the most desperate means to get out.""  While adding new details to the narrative, parts of the story may suffer from dating, as the article focused on the author's meeting with the Karpeles three months before his recent arrest.  For example, the article ended with a surprisingly optimistic note by emphasizing how Karpeles believes he'll have the chance to put his interests in business to use in the market again.  ""Whether he's found guilty or innocent, he's not done dreaming yet. He hopes to take the lessons he's learned at Mt Gox and create a more secure form of digital cash,"" the author wrote.  Dark market shutters  Following the mainstream media's apparent appreciation for bitcoin-related illicit activity, some journalists this week also picked up on the ""temporary"" closure of dark web marketplace Agora.  The dark market website, thought to be the most popular in terms of daily transaction volume, uses bitcoin to facilitate the purchase of both legal and illegal goods.  One of the first and most widely cited pieces was by Wired's Andy Greenberg, who began his article by alluding to Agora's predecessor, Silk Road, writing:  ""The Dark Web's biggest marketplace for drugs seems to have learned a lesson from the downfall of the Silk Road: When cracks start to appear in your anonymity's armour, it's time to quit while you're ahead – or, at least, retreat and regroup.""  Still, unlike Silk Road articles, it seems the allure of the connection between bitcoin and crime is beginning to fade.  Stories by Business Insider and International Business Times, for example, mentioned bitcoin only in passing, scarcely stopping to provide a definition of the technology or its role in payments.  Bitcoin trading gets rial  New bitcoin exchanges don't tend to get much fanfare these days in the mainstream media, however, the launch of BTXCapital, a trading platform targeting the Iranian market, bucked this trend.  Launched on 24th August, the exchange is not the first business to open its doors in the controversial Middle Eastern state, but it was uncharacteristically public about the announcement given the past reticence of local community members to communicate with the global community.  The exchange's application services firm, Draglet, suggested to International Business Times that BTXCapital's efforts in the region could be shortlived.  ""From a Western perspective, it's cool to have bitcoin spreading this way,"" company CEO Ganesh Jung told the news source. ""There are no legal concerns from our side, but the Iranian government could block this kind of service.""  Despite the caution, even from firms affiliated with the venture, IBTimes was, as usual, bombastic with its headline, emphasizing quotes about the ""huge untapped market"" that the exchange could perhaps unlock for bitcoin.  Elsewhere, the news received coverage from payments industry news source, The Paypers, as well as a slew of cryptocurrency blogs and publications.  At press time, the price of bitcoin on the service was roughly $260, a figure that represents a 10% premium from more liquid bitcoin exchange markets.

42378297,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhl5,1440771883,USAA: Bitcoin and Blockchain Are FinTech Game-Changers,"Vic Pascucci is quick to use the phrase ""game changer"" when talking about bitcoin and blockchain technology.  The current USAA head of corporate development and board member at its portfolio startups including Saffron, ID.me and Automatic Labs says he hasn't seen many technologies that meet this description during his nearly 20 years in the VC sector.  Bitcoin and the blockchain, in his opinion, are very different than other areas of interest for the insurance, investing and banking firm, founded in 1922.  ""I've been working in technology since the early 1990s, I never thought I'd see something as big as the Internet,"" Pascucci, who has been with USAA since he joined as legal counsel for its technology team in 2006, said in interview.  However, he suggested he may be more optimistic about the technology's future than the US military-focused financial firm, which generated $24bn in revenue in 2014 and manages $26.7bn in net worth for its members.  Pascucci told CoinDesk:  ""I've seen a lot of great things out there that could help our members and our enterprise, but I think the biggest potential game-changer long-term will be bitcoin and the blockchain.""  This interest, according to Pascucci, is propelled by how well the financial technology hits on its three core areas of focus – finance, consumer Internet and digital capabilities. ""We look for those convergences that have that synergy,"" he continued.  But while there is much speculation as to how USAA could ultimately deploy bitcoin-based services or blockchain technology, Pascucci remained tight lipped about what the team he said based full-time on the blockchain is currently developing.  ""We want to be sensitive to how much we expose,"" he said. ""We experiment a lot, and if we come out too early, our members expect to see it. The last thing we want to do is mismanage our users' expectations, so we want to be sensitive to that.""  Pascucci did hint that the group is working on applications on both the bitcoin blockchain and on private blockchains that would potentially enable the company to track assets and claims and conduct real-time record-keeping.  ""There are so many efficiencies we can unlock,"" he added.  Chance meeting  To date, USAA's biggest move in the space was its participation in Coinbase's $75m Series C round, completed in early 2015 – a move he attributed to an early meeting with the company.  Pascucci said that, in order to keep pace with emerging technologies, his team makes frequent visits to the West Coast to meet with venture firms and FinTech startups.  ""We sat down with [Coinbase co-founder] Fred [Ehrsam], Micky Malka from Ribbit Capital and just had a great conversation about bitcoin and the blockchain and the efficiency it would bring,"" he recalled.  But it was the makeup of the bitcoin services firm's user base that ultimately convinced USAA to make Coinbase one of its estimated 10 to 12 annual deals, where it invests anywhere from $1m to $10m in venture capital.  ""We saw an amazing index of USAA members using Coinbase,"" he said. ""We were one of the most active user groups, but we saw our members' accounts were twice the size and they tended to be twice as active.""  From there, Pascucci said USAA realized it needed to ""move fast"" to better understand the technology, investing because of the combination of market analysis and member association.  As for whether it remains interested in subsequent investments in the space, Pascucci was optimistic if non-committal, adding:  ""There's a strong feeling we'll do more, but we've got all types of lines of businesses to serve.""  Possible applications  Right now, Pascucci said USAA is still working to develop a thesis on the technology, and it hasn't decided where it might be most applicable.  Still, Pascucci acknowledged bitcoin and the blockchain could impact how USAA interacts internally, with other financial organizations, with its members and how its members interact with each other.  ""It's that kind of constant balancing act as to where we're going to see the best benefit for our members and the cost,"" Pascucci said. ""It feels like bitcoin is most advanced but it feels like the enterprise capabilities are so vast, but it could all take time.""  More specifically, Pascucci deflected comments on whether it was pursuing blockchain-based recordkeeping technologies for use in its insurance claims process.  Ultimately, Pascucci said USAA will continue to base its decisions on feedback from members, with whom he stressed the firm strives to maintain a dialogue regarding its decisions. Should users be uncomfortable with or unsure about the need for certain features provided by the technology, he suggested any interest could fall by the wayside.  ""They could surprise us and say 'We like the set up the way it is,' he said. ""We see the capabilities and the power, but the members are going to tell us what they like.""  Pascucci suggested regulatory uncertainty surrounding the technology was another factor, citing discussion as to whether bitcoin is best considered a currency or security.  ""My take on that is that the level of understanding has to be consistent with regulations,"" he continued. ""The regulations weren't designed for these types of things.""  Ongoing discovery  As for the ongoing work at its facilities, Pascucci was less specific with details, noting that 90% of his team is working on the firm's venture arm and tracking emerging trends.  ""I have a team of nine that works for me,"" Pascucci explained. ""Zach Gibson, our chief innovation officer, he has the tech resources to incubate ideas, they have a full team of people that's exploring disruptive technologies and we're working closely with that team.""  Pascucci said USAA has an equally strong interest in technologies that enable communication with its members, given that it has no physical branches. Cybersecurity, storage, networking and analytics also remain top priorities in the innovation lab.  Cost, he suggested, would also be a factor in the company's decisions, and that ultimately any solution it pursues would need to balance expenditure with benefit.  Pascucci concluded:  ""My team in corporate development is responsible for identifying emerging trends that will ensure it's as relevant the next 100 years as it was the last 100 years.""

42378298,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhor,1440758184,ChangeTip Users Can Now Turn Bitcoin Tips into Gift Cards,"ChangeTip users can now swap their digital currency tips for real-life goods, thanks to an integration with digital gift card provider Gyft.  The bitcoin tipping service, which has raised $4.25m in funding to date, brands itself as a 'love button' for various social media channels including Facebook, Twitter and Reddit.  Until now, ChangeTip users could top up their accounts via Coinbase, bitcoin or credit/debit card, however they could only cash out in bitcoin. Following the firm's announcement yesterday evening, they now have the option to redeem gift cards from Starbucks, iTunes, Xbox and Amazon. They range from $1 all the way up to $2,000.    Alongside denominations in dollars and 'bits' (0.000001 BTC), the platform has various 'monikers' – such as coffees ($1.50), doughnuts ($0.35) and high-fives ($5.00) – that users can tip each other.      ""We are doing this because it's important for people to use their tips. If you receive a coffee, claim the coffee,"" Victoria van Eyk, ChangeTip's community manager, told CoinDesk.      ""If it goes well I'd love to link monikers to gift cards, so you can send someone an item and have them claim it at a store,"" she added.      Gyft, which has been accepting bitcoin since 2013, is one of the most popular gift card services for bitcoin users. Earlier this year, a report from its processor, BitPay, indicated 39% of its transactions were related to gift cards.

42378281,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fhUj,1440754571,Sentencing Looms for Teen Who Promoted ISIL Bitcoin Donations,"UPDATE (28th August 10:53 BST): Ali Shukri Amin has been sentenced to 11 years and four months in prison, according to the US Justice Department.      A Virginia teenager who offered online advice on how to use bitcoin to fund terrorist group ISIL is to be sentenced today.  Federal prosecutors asked US District Court Judge Claude Hilton to sentence 17-year-old Ali Shukri Amin to 15 years in prison after he pled guilty in June to a charge of providing material support to ISIL.  In a statement of facts from June, prosecutors said Amin used social media to promote ISIL and discussed “ways to establish a secure donation system” using bitcoin. Amin previously worked as a journalist for the cryptocurrency news site CoinBrief. He was arrested in March.  Amin also admitted to encouraging another Virginia teen to support ISIL and later helped him travel to Syria.  In asking for the 15-year sentence, prosecutors wrote:  “The defendant’s conduct has had an impact on worldwide security, the United States’ security, and the lives of Reza Nikejad and his family. Under a best case scenario, Niknejad will return to the United States to be prosecuted and incarcerated for his activities. It is far more likely, unfortunately, that he will accomplish the goal that this defendant set out for him; martyrdom in the name of ISIL.”  The defense asked the court for a sentence of 75 months, or just over six years, based on Amin’s lack of a criminal history, strong academic record as a high school student and his cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation since his arrest.  In a letter to Judge Hilton, Amin wrote that he had renounced his support for ISIL, “its violence and the way it twists the core tenets of Islam into weapons killing and oppression”.
