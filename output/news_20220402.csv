Individuals, collectives, and companies are tapping into these technologies, reinventing how we form communities and exchange value. The challenge is that this is the prime time to be on the cutting edge, but Web3 is still hard to understand at face value. Worldwide, the vast majority of Internet users have no idea what an NFT is, much less how to safely buy one. Even those familiar with NFTs can have trouble determining a quality, high-integrity project and can fall prey to cash grabs and rug pulls. And that&apos;s just on the consumer and collector side. Creators moving into Web3 are quickly discovering the limitations of bringing old mindsets into this new frontier. These unique opportunities drove Gareb Shamus and an all-star team to co-found and launch HeroMaker Studios, a Web3 platform that connects creators, fans, and collectors with a metaverse of all-new superheroes, comic books, and digital collectibles. &apos;NFTs are so much more than making a beautiful piece of art,&apos; Shamus continued. &apos;They&apos;re also about allowing everyone to participate in the success of a creative idea across its lifecycle, and even in perpetuity. Web3 gives us the power to include people at every step. Never before have creators been able to express themselves and launch their ideas in such a powerful way.&apos; &apos;Web3 beneficiari...",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/heromaker-studios-and-the-future-of-character-franchises-or-how-web3-is-redefining-storytelling-for-creators-and-fans/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42395714,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyc5K,1648933140,Pudgy Penguins NFT Collection Looks to Next Chapter With $2.5M Sale,"The Pudgy Penguins non-fungible token (NFT) project is under new leadership after the close of a long-awaited 750 ETH ($2.5 million) sale.  A group led by Pudgy Penguins holder and Los Angeles-based entrepreneur Luca Netz will buy control of the project, along with royalties, from the original four co-founders of the project, according to people involved with the deal. Netz will be the new leader of “The Huddle,” along with his collaborator Cameron Moulène and several other stakeholders.  Control of the project will allow the buyers’ group to launch a token and conduct airdrops to other holders of the NFT series, as well as other rights.  The deal comes as the Pudgy Penguins community ousted their founding team in a contentious Discord vote in January. Since then, holders of the cute flightless digital birds have been waiting for word on the project’s uncertain future.  “This deal [has] taken way longer than I thought,” said Netz, who last spoke with CoinDesk in January when a preliminary deal was struck between Netz and the prior founding team.  On Friday, Pudgy Penguin trading spiked on NFT marketplace OpenSea as deal closing rumors swirled. The floor price of a Pudgy Penguin jumped as high as 2.5 ether (ETH) after trading bounced between 0.7 and 1.4 ETH the past few weeks. As of press time, the cheapest penguin on offer was listed at 2.2 ETH.  Netz planned to officially announce the close of the sale on social media late Saturday, and added that the deal was “100% not an April Fool’s joke” in an interview with CoinDesk on Friday; hence his decision to wait until after April 1 to go public.  “Everything is aligned to make this one of the most prevalent projects of all time,” said Netz, who declined to comment on specific roadmap items, but hinted at at least one retail partnership.  New leadership  Launched in July, the Pudgy Penguins has become one of the most popular NFT collections, with over 49,000 ether in trading volume (about $171 million in today’s ether prices) on the NFT marketplace OpenSea.  It was featured in a New York Times column last summer detailing the NFT phenomenon, and currently touts celebrities such as National Basketball Association All-Star Steph Curry and rapper Tory Lanez among its holders.  “Penguins were my first NFT purchase,” Netz told CoinDesk. He says he was drawn to the collection because the digital penguins – donning accessories from wizard hats to bowties – “emit joy.” Netz purchased his first penguin for about 0.1 ETH last summer.  “It’s an interesting emotion to feel when looking at an NFT project,” said Netz. “The collections that evoke emotion are the most powerful.”  “They were so darn cute and everyone loved them,” said Twitter user JoeyMooose of the project’s initial reception. JoeyMooose owns a Pudgy Penguin sporting a green mohawk and coined the collection’s popular rallying cry, “I am my penguin and my penguin is me” during an emotional Pudgy Penguins Twitter Spaces event.  Netz, who built a successful dropshipping business before dabbling in NFTs, says he will head the project’s marketing efforts and turn the Pudgy Penguins into “a brand that’s known both in and outside of the NFT world.”  When asked about a possible Pudgy Penguin toy, Netz responded, “It would be fiscally irresponsible if I didn’t do that.”  Wen $PENGU Token?  Rumors also circulated Friday that the long-awaited Pudgy Penguins token would be announced, further fueling the penguin buying frenzy.  ""Speculative fervor is beginning to emerge around NFT floors when there's the expectation of tokenization, even if it's often just rumors,"" said Twitter user GiganticRebirth, an influential member of the Pudgy Penguins community who holds the rare Ghost Penguin. ""With tokenization, it strengthens the thesis that NFTs will serve as yield-bearing assets.""  Such a move would follow in the footsteps of Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club, which launched its ApeCoin (APE) token earlier this month.  Netz denied the rumors but promised a token that “respected the law” would eventually come.  “If [Bored Ape Yacht Club] did it, we will do it,” Netz told CoinDesk on Friday. “But it’s not something I want to tackle now.”  Penguin coup  Pudgy Penguin holders, who collectively refer to themselves as “The Huddle” and “Pengus,” have faced a tumultuous couple of months after their initial slingshot to fame.  With several ""accidental"" de-listings on OpenSea and declining sales so far this year, the desire for competent leadership has been long awaited.  According to multiple sources, the original Pudgy Penguins founding team made lofty promises to the community, including launching a children's book, a token and a metaverse game centered around the penguin images. Ultimately, none of the projects came to fruition.  Meanwhile, other profile picture projects such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and Cool Cats have seen their prices surge last fall, leaving many holders of the Pudgy Penguins NFTs disappointed.  Pudgy Penguins co-founder Cole Thereum did not respond to repeated requests for comment via Twitter message.  Tensions came to a head on Christmas Day, when a hotly anticipated airdrop revealed NFTs of fishingrods, which were initially misspelled as “rogs.”  “That was the rod that broke the camel’s back,” said Twitter user ActuallyAgents, a Pudgy Penguins community manager, who added that many penguin holders anticipated a game at the time of the reveal. “Imagine if you were a kid waking up on Christmas and your grandma got you a PlayStation2 game, but you didn’t own a PlayStation2.”  In January, the pseudonymous Twitter user 9x9x9 (and holder of the rare Banana Penguin) dropped a thread alleging the Pudgy Penguin founders drained the project’s treasury of funds and offered to sell the project’s shell to him for 888 ETH.  The revelations sparked an uproar in the Pengu community, which culminated in the fateful Discord vote ousting the founders. The floor price of a Pudgy Penguin fell to a low of 0.5 ETH.  Barbarians at the igloo  The vote marked the project’s subsequent descent into chaos, as competing bids, a white knight offer and a grassroots effort to fork the community all played out on social media.  A bidding war broke out over the project in early January, with Luca Netz offering 750 ETH to purchase the penguins. Other public competing offers came from Mintable founder Zach Burks and NFT influencer BeanieMaxi.  The pseudonymous trader GiganticRebirth offered a matching 750 ETH to Thereum and the founders to “wait for a more suitable buyer,” a suggestion that went unheeded.  Another pseudonymous trader, Twitter user Vincent Van Dough, who heads up the Three Arrows Capital offshoot Starry Night Capital, announced he would be “wrapping” his 50+ penguins in an effort to cut off royalty payments to the original founders and jumpstart the formation of a community-owned decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  “Wrapping” refers to a smart contract that takes an asset and issues a parallel asset. Wrapping, the thinking goes, would allow a penguin-holder to maintain the aesthetics of their NFT but sever relations with the original Pudgy Penguins ERC-721 contract. Wrapped penguins can also be converted back to the original at any time.  “We saw this as a perfect opportunity to build a tool that would give the community some leverage,” said Metadrop co-founder Psyopcop during a Discord call with CoinDesk.  Metadrop is an NFT platform that released the code for the wrapper, which has also been used by other NFT communities in turmoil.  Even for penguin holders that chose not to opt into the wrapper, the threat itself turned the smart contract into a game of nuclear politics. “They like having it as an option,” said Metadrop’s loomdart. “Just having it gives the community leverage.”  As of Saturday afternoon, data from Nansen showed a supply of 560 wrapped penguins, or approximately 6% of the total project.  “I think Wrapped Penguins is a really interesting experiment that allows community members to opt out of the status quo,” said Alex Svanevik, CEO of Nansen, who is himself a Pudgy Penguin holder. “You could argue it’s a community fork of the original NFT collection.”  Adding to the drama, Van Dough also challenged Mintable’s Burks to make a “legit offer” on his rare Shark Penguin, saying he would get out of the way and cease the “wrapping” efforts.  “The vibes are just terrible right now,” said JoeyMooose at the time. “It hurts that people are playing this like a game of chess.”  “Too much drama, I can’t keep up,” echoed 9x9x9, who has since shifted his focus onto his OpenDAO project.  Often, holders of rare (and expensive) penguins in the collection exercise outsized influence within the Pudgy community.  The ‘Huddle’ moves forward  Now, the Pudgy Penguins are looking to start a new chapter as the Netz leadership team takes over.  “I’m extremely optimistic and confident in Luca and the team he’s assembled,” Twitter user ActuallyAgents, who will remain in a leadership position under the new regime, told CoinDesk.  “Aside from their great business track record, the philosophy of compassion and inclusivity he wants to bring to the penguins is something the space really needs.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/02/pudgy-penguins-nft-collection-looks-to-next-chapter-with-25m-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a1771f9b436e0dc26ab68d6aceb6cf65fb56f4d-2150x1386.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

13399998,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=230854,1648931425,Oracles – A Bridge Between Real World and Blockchains,"Oracles feed data from the outside world to a blockchain like Ethereum, such as the market price of cryptocurrencies or results of elections. The data can then be used by a smart contract on the blockchain to make decisions, such as whether or not to distribute money and to whom. Here is an example in more detail: Farmers frequently buy agricultural derivatives as insurance if their crops are destroyed by drought. If the weather doesn&apos;t cooperate for the farmer one season, the derivative will compensate them with a lump sum payment. Oracles such as Chainlink and Band control the majority of Oracle&apos;s market. Problems with Oracles The ability to run smart contracts is a defining feature of a blockchain like Ethereum. The smart contract is managed by the blockchain after it has been designed; no entity needs to be trusted to implement the rules. No intermediary can prevent the transaction from occurring as long as the smart contract&apos;s criteria are met. The contract merely executes the instructions given to it. On the other hand, Oracle is a data stream managed by an entity. For Example, a weather oracle. Although blockchains like Ethereum were designed to exclude third parties. Putting your faith in a data source can lead to problems. For Example, the owner of an oracle&apos;s data stream could upload incorrect data to sway smart contracts in their favour.

42395713,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyc4L,1648923879,DeFi Lender Inverse Finance Exploited for $15.6M,"Ethereum-based lending protocol Inverse Finance (INV) said Saturday it suffered an exploit, with an attacker netting $15.6 million worth of stolen cryptocurrency.  According to Inverse, the attacker targeted its Anchor money market – artificially manipulating token prices to borrow loans against extremely low collateral.  This is the third multimillion-dollar hack of a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol to make headlines this week, and it underscores the increasingly sophisticated techniques being levied by attackers. On Tuesday the gaming-focused Ronin Network announced a loss of more than $625 million in crypto. Two days later, lending protocol Ola Finance said it was exploited for $3.6 million.  According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, the Inverse attacker took advantage of a vulnerability in a Keep3r price oracle Inverse uses to track token prices. The attacker tricked the oracle into thinking that the price of Inverse’s INV token was extraordinarily high, and then took out multimillion-dollar loans on Anchor using the inflated INV as collateral.  The attack was notably well-financed; in order to pull it off, the attacker first withdrew 901 ETH (about $3 million) from Tornado Cash, which is used to disburse crypto without leaving a clear trail. The attacker then injected the mystery funds into several trading pairs on the decentralized exchange SushiSwap – inflating the price of INV in the eyes of the Keep3r price oracle.  With the price of INV sufficiently high, the attacker then took out INV-backed loans on Anchor before arbitrageurs brought the price of INV back down to normal levels.  A representative from PeckShield noted to CoinDesk that the attack was high-risk because the $3 million worth of crypto used to trick the price oracle would have been completely lost if the price of INV fell back to normal levels before the attacker took out the loans.  Altogether, the attacker managed to run away with 1,588 ETH, 94 WBTC, 39 YFI and 3,999,669 DOLA. The attacker has cycled most of the funds back through Tornado Cash – meaning it’s difficult to know where the funds will end up – but 73.5 ETH (about $250,000) remains in the attacker’s original Ethereum wallet.  Inverse said in its announcement it has temporarily paused all borrowing on Anchor, and a representative for the protocol told CoinDesk it is working with Chainlink to build a new INV oracle.  Inverse also announced it plans to make a proposal to its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to “ensure all wallets impacted by the price manipulation are repaid 100%,” though without providing further details.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/02/defi-lender-inverse-finance-exploited-for-156-million,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72c4dd74667340b1c9cacebb1f97476ad77abc29-6016x4016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency with the Shiba Inu dog as its logo has become an inspiration for many other crypto projects. The most recent example is Cliff, although it hasn&apos;t been designed as a purposeful parody. On the contrary, Cliff, which also has a dog as its symbol, is seeking to help investors secure sizable returns by implementing a deflationary model. What Is Cliff and How Does It Work? Cliff is the first token with a true burn function that can directly and instantly boost the price per coin as a result of burning its circulating supply. The burning mechanism makes sure that Cliff keeps eliminating the excess liquidity on a regular basis. Every time it does so, the event pushes the price of each token up by a certain percentage. Besides this, the token&apos;s value also increases as Cliff has exposure to yield-bearing assets with the goal to provide value to token holders. Thus, Cliff is a token seeking to act as a hedge fund and grow continually thanks to two main mechanisms: burning a percentage of the circulating supply and investing in yield-bearing assets. Here is how the burn function works: Every trade on Uniswap or other DEX comes with a liquidity fee. Currently, the tax is set at 5% for buys, and 8% for sells but it&apos;s subject to change based on the market conditions.

The immediate resistance level stands at $0.30. Past Performance The token price is relatively stable at the time of press, adding three percent against the USDT as per the formation in the daily chart. Overall, GALA is in a bullish breakout formation amid headwinds of March 31. GALA Technical Analysis The token might be within a bullish breakout formation, as aforementioned. However, the bearish engulfing pattern of March 31 and the series of lower lows relative to the upper BB points to weakness. The inability of bulls to flow back and reverse yesterday&apos;s losses may also indicate exhaustion. Aggressive traders may look to unpack on pullbacks in lower time frames. It is especially if there are losses below the 20-day moving average at the $0.24 mark. The immediate target, in that case, will be $0.20—or March 2022 lows. What to Expect Fundamentals support GALA bulls. Nonetheless, the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart favors sellers in the immediate term. This is valid unless there is a sharp reversal above the spinning tops of early this week at along $0.30. A close above that level may see GALA rocket to $0.38—February 2022 highs.
