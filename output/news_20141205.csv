42377893,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uPV,1417820707,Congressman Stockman: It’s Too Early to Regulate Bitcoin,"US Representative Steve Stockman (R-TX) received widespread praise from the bitcoin community this week after submitting a bill to US Congress that would prohibit any state or federal regulator from passing bitcoin regulation for the next five years.  Though it may face difficulties appealing to lawmakers who aren't well-versed in the technology, Stockman staunchly advocates for the bill, known formally as the Cryptocurrency Protocol Protection and Moratorium Act, which he views as integral to promoting future job creation in the US.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Stockman indicated that he believes this stay on government intervention in the industry is necessary in order to give the space more time to develop and protect it from special interests that might threaten its growth.  According to Stockman, proposals like the New York State Department of Financial Services' (NYDFS) BitLicense are ""inappropriate"" given that the technology's development is still in its early stages. Citing past innovations in computer technology and the Internet, he said that those entrepreneurs would have been stifled if they encountered similar resistance from regulators.  He said:  ""It’s too early to be talking about that. Just imagine if Steve Jobs had to deal with this, or anybody starting an Internet company having to hop through the obstacles they’re putting up.""  The proposal, the draft text of which was made available earlier this week, is the second bill focused on digital currency submitted by Stockman, though it is larger in scope.  The earlier bill focused on the tax issues related to bitcoin and sought to designate the technology as a type of foreign currency. If passed, the new bill would also reshape the current tax treatment of digital currencies.  Industry needs safeguarding  Stockman said that he is opposed to government rulemaking on the grounds that, once intervention from a regulatory body begins, this involvement typically does not cease.  He continued:  “I fear that anytime the government intercedes it never retracts its position. I was at a conference one time and someone said, 'Oh, after years of government regulation, they'll decrease.’ And I asked, ‘Where has that occurred’? It never has occurred. Whether it’s the IRS code, or the EPA, the regulations increase.""  Stockman continued by saying that the moratorium “will give the industry a chance to grow unimpeded from people with hidden agendas”, which include competitive interests in the finance and banking industries that want to slow down development.  ""Right now, the people opposed to it – they’ve got more firepower and more of an agenda to focus against it,"" he said.  Restoring the balance  Stockman said that one of his main goals for introducing the bill – which comes weeks before he leaves Congress – is to stir up the digital currency conversation on Capitol Hill.  Stockman described an environment in which some members of Congress are in support of the technology as a digital innovation, while others look at bitcoin through the lens of criminal and fraudulent activity, saying:  ""There are some members that understand and there are other members that don’t. I thought that by putting something forward we could at least start the conversation and discuss it. Right now, there’s such a vacuum and there’s no coalescing around an idea, and I thought, well, if I put something out there, maybe we can have the bitcoin community gather together.""  Where this new legislative effort will go, he conceded, remains very much unclear. Although, he said this general uncertainty surrounding the technology and its regulation is one of the most compelling reasons lawmakers should allow the technology to mature.  “Frankly, we don’t know how this is going to turn out,” concluded Stockman. “It’s not preordained.”  Steve Stockman image via Wikipedia",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2014/12/05/congressman-stockman-its-too-early-to-regulate-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/698fbcbfa2d19a025a6b553e78ef4834d39f6133-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377896,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uTH,1417815622,Boost VC to Invest Additional 300 BTC in Each Tribe 5 Bitcoin Startup,"California-based startup accelerator Boost VC is continuing its ""all-in"" dive into the bitcoin space with an announcement of a new fund, Boost Bitcoin Fund 2, which promises each company in its upcoming Tribe 5 startup batch an investment of 300 BTC upon completion of the program.  The fund, which was backed by Draper Associates, is one of many recent announcements to come from Boost VC. In November, the accelerator closed a $6.6m funding round led by Marc Andreessen and Ben Davenport and announced that its next cohort would feature only companies working with bitcoin and blockchain technology.  Boost VC's CEO Adam Draper described the Boost Bitcoin Fund 2 as the accelerator's ""biggest announcement ever"", and noted that the 300 BTC investment (about $113,000 at press time) comes in addition to the initial $10,000–$20,000 in capital that the companies receive upon admission to the accelerator.  Draper explained that the fund will allow Boost VC to continue a program it started with its second batch of startups, Boost Tribe 2, that enabled it to provide $50,000 to each of its graduates.  While the new fund has no exact limit, the most recent batch of startups to graduate Boost – Tribe 4 – hosted 16 bitcoin startups. Draper told CoinDesk that Boost will likely invest in 15–25 bitcoin startups in its upcoming Tribe 5, which would value the Boost Bitcoin Fund 2 between 4,500–7,500 BTC (about $1.7m–$2.8m).  When asked if the timing of the new fund had any connection to the recent US Marshals bitcoin auction – which his father Tim successfully bid on – Draper told CoinDesk that there was ""some coordination between the events"", but commented no further.  The accelerator boasts a portfolio that includes Mirror, snapCard and BitPagos, to name a few, and those enrolled benefit from free housing and a highly collaborative environment.  Boost VC is currently accepting applications for its next batch of startups, Tribe 5.

42377894,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uQl,1417814460,Bitcoin Foundation Hires Developer Sergio Lerner for Full-Time Security Role,"The Bitcoin Foundation has announced the appointment of a new core security auditor as part of its broader shift to focus on bitcoin core development.  Sergio Demian Lerner will become the fourth full-time core developer funded by the Foundation, and will be responsible for reviewing the core code for potential security vulnerabilities. Chief scientist Gavin Andresen announced the hire in a new blog post that comes weeks after issuing a call for developers interested in auditing and testing the core code.  Lerner has long been involved with core development on security matters – having identified a number of vulnerabilities in the bitcoin code over the last few years, and currently works as a security consultant for bitcoin startup Coinspect. He has also called for more robust security reporting standards on bitcoin and has advocated for increased testing of bitcoin’s core code.  Andresen wrote:  “As core security auditor, Sergio will be dedicated to the ongoing security review of changes to the core code. Sergio has been volunteering his time and expertise since March 2012 and over the last couple of years, he has found, reported and helped fix several vulnerabilities in the core code.”  Andresen also announced that the core development team is preparing release candidates for bitcoin version 0.10, and said he hopes the update will be ready for release in January.  Big impact predicted  Andresen suggested in the blog post that bitcoin core progression will benefit significantly from the addition of another full-time developer.  While arguing that bitcoin wouldn’t be where it is today without the vast network of volunteers worldwide, Andresen continued by saying that full-time support is needed to ensure the technology’s long-term success.  He explained:  “People are busy. They have lives, families, careers and hobbies outside of bitcoin. It’s unrealistic to put expectations of a full-time employee onto a volunteer. As more and more people come to rely on this protocol and businesses build products and services powered by bitcoin, it becomes increasingly more important to have a dedicated team doing the painstaking work it requires.”  According to Andresen, Lerner will continue acting as an independent consultant while he also works as the Foundation’s new security guru.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/12/05/bitcoin-foundation-hires-developer-sergio-lerner-for-full-time-security-role,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b63cce1546b8b2231357574ed850356e29a0741-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377888,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uGh,1417813385,"Tim Draper Wins 2,000 BTC in Second US Marshals Bitcoin Auction","Updated (6th December, 6:30 GMT): Updated with commentary from Tim Draper.      Draper Fisher Jurvetson managing director and avid bitcoin enthusiast Tim Draper has once again entered a winning bid in a bitcoin auction held by the US Marshals Service.  However, unlike the first auction, in which he was able to purchase all 29,656 of the auctioned bitcoins, Draper confirmed to CoinDesk that this time he won just one block of 2,000 BTC (worth roughly $750,000 at press time).  In total, 50,000 BTC confiscated from alleged Silk Road ringleader Ross Ulbricht were divided into 10 blocks of 2,000 BTC and 10 blocks of 3,000 BTC for the event. Bidders did not have the ability to view other bids or change bids that they submitted during the auction.  Draper said that Draper Associates will now provide 300 BTC to each startup that graduates Boost VC's next startup accelerator class as a result of the winning bid. The bitcoin-focused startup accelerator was notably founded by his son, Adam Draper.  ""The interesting part is that we are fixing the valuation,"" Draper said. ""The 300 BTC are worth about $120,000 today, but may be worth quite a bit more, or less, when the entrepreneurs receive them.""  He went on to suggest that he will need to purchase additional bitcoins before Boost VC's Tribe 5 graduates. Boost has indicated it will likely invest in 15–25 bitcoin startups for the upcoming class, meaning as much as 7,500 BTC could be needed for the initiative.  ""I will still need to purchase some bitcoin on the open market to fulfill my obligation to Boost,"" he added.  The announcement follows a similar strategy Draper embraced this summer, when at a press conference he announced that the bitcoins won in the initial auction would be used to help bitcoin exchange Mirror serve more global consumers.  The investor is rumoured to have paid above market price for his first batch of bitcoins, though he has declined to disclose the exact figures for either of his winning bids.  Confirmed participants in Thursday's auction included Binary Financial, Bitcoin Investment Trust, Bitcoins Reserve, Mirror (formerly Vaurum) and Pantera Capital.  The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk US Bitcoin Price Index was roughly $640 at the time of the first sale, compared to roughly $370 during yesterday's auction.

42377892,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uOF,1417799362,California to Debate Bitcoin Regulation at December Meeting,"Although home to a sizeable majority of the burgeoning bitcoin industry, California has been relatively quiet on the subject of whether it will seek to regulate digital currency businesses.  However, this could soon change, according to new statements from California's Department of Business Oversight (DBO), the state's financial services and money transmitters regulator.  Speaking to CoinDesk, spokesperson Tom Dresslar confirmed his agency intends to hold a meeting in mid-December that could determine if and when California will decide to clarify the actions the bitcoin industry must take to serve its consumers.  Dresslar said:  ""We're looking at the extent to which our current law gives us the ability to regulate, what the potential approaches to regulation would be and the extent to which we want to regulate.""  Emphasizing that any conclusions about the meeting are likely premature, Dresslar said the DBO could determine whether the agency will ""proceed down a regulatory path"".  Dresslar noted that California is observing the actions taken by other US states, including Kansas, New York and Texas. As such, the agency said new regulation could require bitcoin businesses to become licensed, maintain reserves and have employees undergo criminal background checks, all components of New York's proposed BitLicense.  The statements notably follow an Assembly Bill approved by California Governor Jerry Brown earlier this year that gave bitcoin the status of 'lawful money' under state law alongside rewards points, coupons and other commonly issued forms of value.  The power to regulate  Dresslar indicated that the department has been holding meetings on digital currencies since November 2013, and that a dedicated task force was created to study the issue at that time.  The opinion of this working group, he said, is that the DBO could regulate virtual currency ""to some extent"", and that some applications of the technology would qualify as a medium of exchange under state definitions.  Still, he cautioned that even though this conclusion has been reached, the group requires more time to deliberate other issues.  ""Even though the consensus is that we could regulate, the question is who do we regulate, and that's a decision that ultimately the department will make,"" he added.  Emphasizing consumer protection  Throughout the conversation, Dresslar stressed that California's goal with any action would be to ensure that the state's consumers are protected from the potential risks associated with interacting with the new technology.  ""If we decide to go down this path, our primary objective will be to provide consumer protection to make sure they are fully aware of the risks associated with virtual currency and are afforded with reasonable protections against those risks,"" Dresslar said.  He further told Bloomberg that the agency is unsure whether Governor Brown would need to approve any measure or approach it would adopt.  Dresslar stated that he doesn't want to speculate as to what the implications of such provisions would mean for the state's business community, concluding:  ""I think those assessments would be better made after a regulatory structure is adopted.""

42377897,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uUX,1417783505,Bitupcard Rolls Out Bitcoin Voucher Scheme at 30 Stores Across Turkey,"Amsterdam-based bitcoin seller Bit4coin has teamed up with Berlin-based MK Payment to launch 'Bitupcard' – an e-voucher scheme that enables over-the-counter purchase of bitcoin in 30 retail stores throughout Turkey.  The service goes live today and, notably, could also be made available at up to 5,000 Turkish locations in the near future.  Framing the e-voucher scheme as a way to simplify the on-ramp to bitcoin ownership, Dolf Diedrichsen, Bit4coin's founder and CEO, explained: “One of the most difficult problems of bitcoin is still how to get them.”  He said:  “We want to change that by bringing bitcoin to a trusted retail environment. No need to register an account and send money to some unknown website, no hassle with passwords or security, just an easy way to buy some bitcoin.”  Diedrichsen told CoinDesk that the firm is not able to sell bitcoin vouchers in Germany yet for regulatory reasons, so it is initially launching in Turkey.  ""But this actually works out quite well for us,"" he said. ""Since Turkey is not a very big bitcoin country yet, it provides us with a test bed. We do have plans to provide this service in other countries in the near future as well.”  How it works  Using Bitupcard is similar to the process of buying mobile top-up credit. After selecting a value between 50 and 500 Turkish lira (approximately $20 to $200) and paying with cash or other accepted payment method, customers receive a paper receipt printed with a voucher code.  The buyer must then type in the unique code along with a bitcoin address at bitupcard.com. The bitcoin will subsequently be send to their address within four hours – and usually much less, the company says.  Users are charged a 6% transaction fee, which is deducted from the value of voucher when it is redeemed.  Ease of use  MK Payment is a Germany-based e-payment and technology company, operating an electronic voucher network in the EU and in other regions.  Ibrahim Tarlig, the firm's CEO, said that Bitupcard's biggest selling point is it's ease of use.  He explained that MK Payment brings to the table an extensive retail distribution network throughout Germany and Turkey, while bit4coin brings expertise in bitcoin, as well as a platform to redeem bitcoin gift cards and voucher codes.  ""Together, we are able to deliver a great product that will allow even customers with little prior experience to buy their first bitcoin,” he said.  The two firms won't have the market to themselves, however. Turkey's first bitcoin exchange BTCTurk might provide some competition, especially considering the 6% markup asked to buy cryptocurrency using Bitupcard vouchers.  Diedrichsen doesn't see it that way, though:  “It's not really our focus to compete with exchanges. If you want to buy large amounts of bitcoin there's probably better alternatives out there, but with Bitupcard we're really aiming for beginners who just want to get their feet wet.”  Istanbul image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Aaron van Wirdum,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/05/bitupcard-rolls-out-bitcoin-voucher-scheme-at-30-stores-across-turkey,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1799bf046b78f21939ca62711d1885755e96f9e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377884,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uEB,1417776405,UK Treasury Committee MP: Bitcoin Doesn't Need New Laws,"Last month, the United Kingdom parliament debated an arcane topic that hasn't been raised in the legislative chamber in 170 years: money creation.  The last time the subject was discussed in the House of Commons was when the Bank Charter Act of 1844 was passed. That historic act put an end to British commercial banks' ability to issue banknotes, transferring those powers exclusively to the Bank of England.  The member of parliament who revived the topic in the House was Steve Baker, who was recently elected to a seat on the Treasury Select Committee. The committee is responsible for scrutinising the Treasury, the Bank of England, the tax authority and the financial regulator.  Bitcoin believers who heard the debate would have been pleased to discover that Baker is also a bitcoin user. During the debate, the MP called on the government to move away from creating new regulations specifically for alternative currencies, including bitcoin. Instead, he said, the state should do everything possible to regulate bitcoin under ordinary commercial law.  Speaking to CoinDesk exclusively at the House of Commons, Baker explained his view, conceding that it was a strong position for a politician to adopt.  He said:  ""Bitcoin should be regulated by the ordinary commercial business laws with no additional regulation. It is a big ask. It is saying to people, you can buy bitcoin, but don't come running to us if the exchange goes down or you lost your wallet [private key].""  Technology and finance background  Baker's CV puts him in good stead to grapple with bitcoin's place in the regulatory world. After starting his career as an aerospace engineer in the Royal Air Force, he left in 2000 to complete a master's degree in computation at Oxford University.  After a series of software engineering and consulting jobs, Baker became chief architect of global financing and asset servicing platforms at Lehman Brothers in 2006, a role that gave him a ringside view of the coming financial crisis.  Baker is a member of the Conservative Party, which is in power as part of a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. He was elected MP for Wycombe in 2010 and was elected to the Treasury Select Committee in May. The committee is one of 19 Select Committees created to independently scrutinise the policy, administration and expenditure of government departments.  The less intervention the better  For Baker, the less government intervention in the digital currency world, the better. Bureaucratic attempts to invent a new regulatory framework for bitcoin would only stifle entrepreneurialism and innovation, he said, adding:  ""The government should get out of the way of innovation – as long as it is lawful.""  In Baker's view, the UK government has already been largely supportive of bitcoin. He pointed to the Bank of England's recent research into cryptocurrencies and the Treasury's public call for information about digital currencies as evidence of this.  ""It is a remarkable fact that the UK Treasury is interested in cryptocurrencies at all,"" he said.  When asked if UK banks should adopt a more open posture towards dealing with bitcoin businesses, however, Baker declined to take a stronger stand.  ""The actual risk [for banks] is regulatory, not commercial ... I would not presume to tell the banks how to cope with regulatory risk. I would just implore the government to create conditions that minimise that risk,"" he said.  'Red pill, blue pill' moment  Perhaps Baker's stance on bitcoin regulation should come as no surprise. He is a proponent of the Austrian school of economics, a theory developed in 1871 by University of Vienna professor Carl Menger that emphasises the individual's role in determining a product's relative value.  Baker describes the moment 14 years ago when he read the work of Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, the two leading Austrian school thinkers of the 20th century, as the ""red pill, blue pill moment"".  In line with the Austrian school's elevation of individualism, Baker believes consumers should be allowed to use digital currencies without being encumbered by a new set of laws.  He said:  ""I'm a great believer in personal responsibility. I would say cryptocurrencies right now are accessible to a tiny portion of the population who are both technically competent and sufficiently willing to take risks and so forth.""  What about the inevitable argument that bitcoin needs to be regulated because it is used for sale of illicit goods on dark markets like Silk Road? Baker once again invoked the individualist argument:  ""Money can always be used for different purposes ... Money is a tool like a screwdriver or a hammer, just as cash can be used for prostitution or drugs.""  Buying bitcoin is still cumbersome  Baker cited his experience buying bitcoin from the Kraken exchange as an example of how bitcoin's appeal is limited to a narrow set of the public. He said he had to open a currency trading account with his bank, buy euros to place in the account and then wire the funds to the exchange to purchase bitcoin.  ""My mum and dad are not going to do that,"" he said.  Pulling out his mobile phone to show CoinDesk his Blockchain wallet app, Baker observed that his initial €500 investment in bitcoin had halved in value to about €250.  ""I lost some money on it and I feel a bit stupid,"" he said, adding that he made sure to say in Parliament that he used some of his bitcoins to buy a camera accessory, not to shop on the dark web.  Bad money, good payment system  How, though, does Baker's argument against special regulations for bitcoin square with his own experience, as a financially and technologically savvy individual, losing money on the volatile cryptocurrency?  Baker says the two experiences are consistent with his view of individual responsibility because he doesn't think bitcoin is yet suitable for the man on the street.  Bitcoin has not become a stable store of value so far, Baker said, making it a ""bad money"" that still suffers from speculative bubbles and extreme volatility. But bitcoin is an ""excellent"" payment system, he added, although he believed that the digital currency is due for a drop into the ""trough of despondency"" before it rises in popularity.  Nevertheless, Baker is optimistic that bitcoin, or another cryptocurrency, will take hold of payments technologies in the near future. He describes a world, 10 years from now, where people use cryptocurrencies ""without a second thought"", transacting digitally to buy coffee or groceries.  Digital currencies were also lauded by a shadow cabinet minister from the opposition Labour Party, Chi Onwurah, two weeks ago. In an interview with CoinDesk, she said bitcoin could shift power away from big banks and return it to consumers.  The UK government has been largely positive towards bitcoin. The most visible move was Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne hailing digital currencies as a way to turn Britain into a ""global centre of financial innovation"" this summer.
