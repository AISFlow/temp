42431077,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzdrh,1570570603,Bitfinex Says It Shouldn't Have to Collect Documents for NYAG During Appeal,"Bitfinex is clutching its documents despite objections from the office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG).  In a letter filed to the New York State Supreme Court Tuesday, attorneys for Bitfinex, Tether and other affiliated entities wrote that a request made by the NYAG’s office relating to a $900 million loan between sister companies Bitfinex and Tether should be denied.  Lawyers for Bitfinex claim the NYAG’s office did not cite any authority supporting its request, further suggesting that the state prosecutor seems to believe that the “collection burdens are meaningless.”  That said, the letter admits that simply collecting the documents would require a significant expense.  The letter also pushes back against allegations that the exchange is stalling on its court-ordered document production requirements.  ""OAG’s allegations concerning delay are in all events misleading, and unfairly attack the motives of the Respondents and their counsel,"" the letter – signed by Jason Weinstein of Steptoe & Johnson, and David Miller and Zoe Phillips of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius – states.  As one example, the letter notes:  ""OAG complains of being unable to conduct a ‘thorough’ or ‘coherent’ investigation (OAG Letter, at 2), but fails to mention that Respondents have already produced material pertaining to customers with New York connections.""  These materials apparently include more than 70,000 pages of documents produced between May and July 2019 (the NYAG’s office previously claimed that the respondents “failed to produce a single non-jurisdictional document” between April and August 2019).  Bitfinex’s attorneys filed a number of exhibits to support their letter, including the motion materials for the exchange’s appeal and a transcript of a court proceeding from May 6, 2019.  Six months on  The NYAG’s office alleged in April that Bitfinex lost access to $850 million held by a payment processor, and covered up the loss by borrowing from Tether’s reserves, which were meant to back the USDT stablecoin at a 1:1 ratio.  Attorneys for the NYAG successfully secured an injunction from the New York Supreme Court that ordered the companies to turn over all documentation about the process, as well as prevent Tether from loaning any further funds to Bitfinex. In August, an appeals court granted Bitfinex a temporary stay, allowing the companies some breathing room before turning over any documents.  The NYAG’s office asked the New York judge to order Bitfinex to collect all of the documents pertaining to the loan, to ensure they could be immediately turned over if the government wins the appeal.  While Bitfinex pushed back against the request to collect all the documents called for in a previous court order in its letter Tuesday, the company said it would not oppose a request to extend the injunction by a further 90 days.  The appeal is set to be heard in January 2020, the letter said, adding:  ""Even if a decision issues immediately, a further period of 90 days under the injunction will take us to April 2020 – a full year from when the injunction first issued. This is by any measure an excessively long period of time, and certainly more than enough time for tether holders to decide in full view of the facts whether they would like to continue holding their tethers or to redeem.""  Tuesday's letter comes on the heels of a new putative class action lawsuit alleging Bitfinex and Tether caused immense damage to the crypto market as a result of its use of USDT to manipulate the bitcoin market. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, references the NYAG action against Bitfinex as evidence supporting its allegations.

42431099,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzePh,1570564803,"'Scam' or Iteration? At Devcon, Ethereum Diehards Still Believe in 2.0","The Takeaway:  Ethereum's creators acknowledge the blockchain wasn't built to scale as a mainstream transaction platform.  A planned reboot meant to address some of those issues, known as Eth 2, is at least two years away.  There is no finite plan for how or when to migrate tokens and smart contracts onto Eth 2, according to ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, James Prestwich and other leading community members. There are, however, many proposals for how it might be done.  Ethereum devotees at the network's premier conference, Devcon, took all this in stride. Unlike the blockchain's critics, they see iteration as inherent to development.      For ethereum’s critics in the bitcoin community, last month brought a “gotcha” moment.  Joseph Lubin, co-founder of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, acknowledged onstage at Ethereal Tel Aviv that the network, in its original form, wasn’t built for mass adoption. “We knew it wasn’t going to be scalable for sure,” the ConsenSys CEO said.  Predictable cries of “scam” from ardent bitcoiners followed. But Lubin’s statement wasn’t scandalous in the least to the ethereum fans at Devcon – the community’s largest and most influential annual gathering – where roughly 3,000 attendees gathered this week in Osaka, Japan.  Even those who knew the first version wasn’t scalable don’t see early marketing claims as misleading. They see iteration as an inherent process.  “Bitcoiners are kinda like hardcore fascist Catholics that just think everything else is wrong,” Dean Eigenmann, a researcher at the ethereum startup Status, told CoinDesk. “I think [ethereum] underdelivered on its promises, but it has delivered.”  The sanguine vibe at Devcon highlights the difference between bitcoin and ethereum, which has emerged as its own force to be reckoned with: Bitcoin is an individualistic monetary asset while ethereum, convoluted as its path to mass adoption may be, is a communal promise to continue experimenting with smart contracts, together.  Summa co-founder James Prestwich, one of the leaders of a project aiming to create cross-chain capital flows between bitcoin and ethereum, told CoinDesk he believes all cryptocurrency narratives evolve. So even if a blockchain manifests something different than the original white paper, that doesn’t make it a scam.  “Something will exist in 10 years. It may not bear any resemblance to [the ethereum] that exists today. And there may not be good continuity,” Prestwich said. “But something named ethereum will be around in 10 years.”  Speaking of the Ethereum Foundation, led in part by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, Eigenmann added:  “The foundation hasn’t taken the money and run.”  So what have the ethereum founders delivered since they sold more than 7 million tokens to retail investors to kickstart the network in 2014?  For starters, they spawned a global lifestyle brand. There’s a distinct aesthetic that defines ethereum events, from rainbows and pastel palettes, vegan-friendly snacks and magician-themed group panels about financial inclusion.  Many of the attendees gathered on Tuesday were among the cohort who had previously put their money in communal pools governed by open-source software, including more than $537 million worth of crypto locked into decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. If bitcoiners harp on “freedom” from censorship, ethereum fans are focused on creating “open” and “collaborative” platforms with more egalitarian governance than traditional institutions.  The bottom line is, the original ethereum platform inspired billions of dollars worth of economic activity, from token sales to DeFi loans, and influenced the way regulators view cryptocurrencies that “decentralized” after fundraising. Ethereum also attracted a devoted following of more than 17,000 developers around the world, according to the startup Dappros.  But the jury is still out as to whether that accrued value will translate to the next version of the smart contract platform.  'Lack of strategy'  Devcon attendees weren’t shy in discussing the road ahead, or who will fund this work.  According to Peter Mauric, ethereum client Parity’s head of communications, the bulk of ethereum-related funding programs will now prioritize creating a new blockchain, Eth 2. Sources with knowledge of such development plans estimated it would take at least two years to build this next version of ethereum.  “No one really knows what Eth 1 will look like once Eth 2 exists,” Mauric told CoinDesk. “There's not a ton of new development going on in the current chain clients. Most of the ongoing work is maintenance.""  As Prestwich explained, the first phase of Eth 2 – called Phase 0 – is coming this winter:  ""Ether moved to the Phase 0 chain will be converted to a new token. These tokens can't be moved on-chain. At least six months after launch, a hard fork will add transfers. Until then, users are locked in.""  There’s no clear plan for how to migrate hundreds of ethereum-based tokens and smart contracts, including DeFi projects, to the new chain in the foreseeable future, according to Buterin, Prestwich and Mike Porcaro, head of communications at the MakerDAO Foundation.  Developer Jamie Pitts, contracted by the Ethereum Foundation, kicked off the opening ceremony on Tuesday by sharing his concerns.  “I feel like there’s a lack of strategy,” Pitts said. “I think there’s a lot of teams working on their ideas, but there’s a lack of coordination.”  According to James Beck, communications lead at ConsenSys, the Brooklyn-based venture studio helmed by Lubin, there are nine teams working on clients for the upcoming Eth 2 blockchain, including Prysmatic Labs, Chainsafe, Status and the ConsenSys-owned startup PegaSys. (Data site EthHub has further information on the nine teams, including how they've been funded to date.)  However, according to several sources with knowledge of ethereum infrastructure projects, the bulk of funds for Eth 1 and Eth 2 development still comes from either the Ethereum Foundation or ConsenSys, in addition to smaller funding mechanisms like the MolochDAO and the Meta Cartel, both of which also accept public donations. Pitts told CoinDesk this doesn’t concern him because these funders don’t control development choices.  As such, one Parity staff member stood up during the opening ceremony and said that finding “more ways to get funding for protocol design” was imperative.  Then, during an afternoon panel about the transition from Eth 1 to Eth 2, Buterin said there will “eventually” be a roadmap for transitioning tokens to the new system with “close to no disruption at all.” The audience asked several questions about the price of the new tokens on Eth 2, what will happen regarding price variations on the open market between these assets and how exchanges might support liquidity during the transition.  There were no definitive responses from the panel of ethereum core developers, including Buterin.  While there are still many unanswered questions about how the project will diversify beyond reliance on funding from its founders, Josh Cincinnati, director of the Zcash Foundation, told CoinDesk ethereum has achieved a significant level of decentralized participation from the bottom-up.  Said Cincinnati:  ""Something Ethereum has proven to be really good at is making exotic financial contracts approachable for developers.""  Parallel universes  Since Eth2 won't be the first time the ethereum community created a new chain, many fans believe it will be possible for both ethereum ecosystems to remain healthy simultaneously.  Back in 2016, differing opinions of how to address The DAO hack led to a community rift that split the chain into Ethereum Classic (ETC, the real “original” ethereum) and the chain we now call just “ethereum” (Eth 1). Today, CoinMarketCap lists ETC as having a global market cap worth more than $525 million, while ethereum itself is listed at $19.5 billion.  Likewise, Tomasz Kajetan Stańczak, founder of the startup Nethermind, told CoinDesk his team plans to continue maintaining a client for the current version of ethereum as long as people use it.  “We believe that will be, to some extent, forever,” he said, adding that out of $150,000 his startup as earned since 2017, at least a third of that funding came directly from the Ethereum Foundation. “At the moment, we are showing [prospective] funders in the community that we deliver an important and high-quality product that will benefit both ethereum and DeFi long-term.”  Stańczak said his company also plans to build infrastructure for Eth 2, as he believes the community always knew Eth 1 couldn’t scale to a point of satisfying user demands.  “As with internet connection bandwidth, I do not expect ethereum users to ever be satisfied with the capacity,” he said. “I see ethereum as a limited resource. ... There are plenty of ideas around the corner that will greatly optimize the platform’s usability.”  Indeed, ethereum’s blockchain space is a limited resource. Due to the system’s congested bottleneck, transaction fees skyrocketed to $350,000 per day in late September. And as a report by Coin Metrics pointed out, blocks were nearly 94 percent full, with scant capacity to support growing demand.  Plus, this overloaded system is already propped up with reliance on corporate infrastructure providers like Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.  According to a survey by the blockchain startup Chainstack, more than 57 percent of ethereum nodes run on such cloud hosting providers. So if any of these corporations stopped supporting professional node operators, the blockchain would lose much of its capacity.  However, this doesn’t concern ethereum fans. They are less focused on minimizing trust than their bitcoiner counterparts.  Mauric told CoinDesk there’s “almost no reason” for individuals to run their own archival nodes. He expects most of this work will continue to be outsourced to service providers like the ConsenSys project Infura.  Plus, he argued that a pruned ethereum node with limited capabilities could still verify transactions in the rare circumstances where this is needed.  Vitalik's view  From Buterin’s perspective, Eth 1 was a successful experiment that paved the way for Eth 2, which will require a focus on incentives, through proof-of-stake, before live transactions.  “I’d argue it has done a lot of good. The ICO boom has pretty much single-handedly funded research into all of these general cryptography things,” Buterin told CoinDesk, referring to the 2017 explosion of initial coin offerings, many of them conducted with ethereum tokens.  As for layer-two solutions, which allow a high number of transactions to take place off-chain and reserve the ethereum ledger for final settlement, Buterin said some are proceeding ""slower than expected. Raiden hasn’t gotten too far too fast and Plasma hasn’t gotten too far too fast. But people are still iterating and working on that.”  Buterin also mentioned pressure from businesspeople who discouraged him from speaking openly about these scaling challenges, which, as noted, many felt were obvious.  “You’re not supposed to say your own platform has limitations,” Buterin said.  The nonprofit foundation, led day-to-day by director Aya Miyaguchi, has at least six years of runway left to fund development and continue growing the community, Buterin said.  “There’s a lot of new faces,” he added:  “Most of the Eth 2 development teams, most of them weren’t even around before 2018.”  Once Phase 0 activates the “beacon chain” this winter, kicking off the first stage of building Eth 2, holders will be able to cash in their original ether and “stake” them to run the new chain. This will, theoretically, incentivize the community to work on the new chain until it is usable.  Mauric estimated it would take a “few years” to make cross-chain tooling. Porcaro, of the MakerDAO Foundation, told CoinDesk his project’s leadership is interested in learning more around the migration to Eth 2. Yet his foundation declined to offer any statement about the future of the ethereum-backed DeFi system, at least at this stage.  Likewise, many token fans expect the current ethereum system will endure even after its primary sources of funding – the Ethereum Foundation and ConsenSys – pivot to focus resources on building the new platform.  “I believe that ethereum will remain the major platform for DeFi and many other blockchain solutions for a very, very long time,” Stańczak said, concluding:  “It will grow and it will be ever stronger.”  Correction (Oct. 9, 21:07 UTC): According to ethereum startup Status, the number of its staffers working on Eth 2 efforts is nine, not one, as was previously reported.

The first mention of TON and its native gram tokens appeared on Telegram's official website Tuesday morning in the form of a terms of service (ToS) for the token's wallet app. According to the ToS, Telegram will integrate the wallet into the company's flagship messaging app and also offer it as a standalone product.  ""We have no control over the TON Blockchain network and therefore cannot ensure that any transaction details that you submit via the Services will be validated and confirmed on the TON Blockchain,"" the document reads.  The wallet is provided by the London-based Telegram FZ-LLC, one of the entities Telegram registered for messaging operations and an official publisher of the Android-based Telegram app.  According to the ToS, Telegram will not keep either personal information of its users nor their public and private keys:  ""You are solely responsible for managing and maintaining the security of your Credentials. If you lose your Credentials, we do not have the ability to recover your Credentials or assist you in retrieving your Credentials, and you may not be able to access your Grams.""  The company also states it has no control over processing and verifying the transactions on TON. According to the ToS:  ""The transactions you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed by the TON Blockchain. We have no control over the TON Blockchain and do not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests to transactions you have submitted. A fee may be imposed on your transaction by the TON Blockchain. We have no control over the amount or type of such fees.""  This is the first time Telegram has publicly acknowledged the link to TON. Neither the company's CEO, Pavel Durov, nor other company representatives have ever announced the project or commented on it.  So far, only the registration of TON's simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – which listed Telegram, Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai – had formally linked the company to the blockchain project.  Investors bought the future gram tokens during two closed rounds in February and March of 2018 for a price of 37 cents and $1.33 each, respectively. In early September, the code for TON's blockchain nodes was released and on Oct. 2, investors received emails with links to TON's key generator (so that they can access their actual tokens).

42431093,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzeNh,1570552202,Tiny $217 Options Trade on Bitcoin Blockchain Could Be Wall Street's Death Knell,"The cryptocurrency industry isn't replacing Wall Street just yet. But inventors and entrepreneurs are working on it, with some initial success, albeit modest.  In this case, an option premium of 0.0202 bitcoin ($217 at the time) paid via a smart contract may have just become the proof of concept.  The latest target for blockchain disruption is options trading tied to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the main benchmark for U.S. stocks. It's a massive market, with roughly $400 billion of the options changing hands every day last year, on average.  Under the current setup, Wall Street firms typically execute the trades and handle the settlement afterward – essentially making sure the securities end up in the buyer's account, and that the cash ends up with the seller. But for investors, the process can be expensive, due to the middlemen fees being charged, and slow, with settlement typically taking a day or two.  In July, Emmanuel Goh, CEO of London-based firm skew., a startup specializing in analytical tools for the crypto industry, says he came up with the idea of using the bitcoin blockchain – the decentralized computer network underpinning the decade-old cryptocurrency – to trade S&P 500 options.  Goh was previously a trader in London for JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, where he slung options on auto, chemical, consumer and industrial stocks. In other words, the options market is an arena he knows well, at least in the traditional sense. Earlier this month, skew. (which spells its name with a period) announced $2 million in seed funding from several venture capital firms, including the Silicon Valley icon Kleiner Perkins.  The S&P options project was entirely experimental, Goh told CoinDesk – the challenge was mainly to see if it could be done. (The publicity probably doesn't hurt, either.) Since the trade would essentially be automated via computer programming, it would be less expensive to conduct and settle a lot faster, maybe in just 10 or 15 minutes, according to Goh.  Goh said the technology that made it possible comes from Crypto Garage, a subsidiary of the publicly traded, Tokyo-based tech firm Digital Garage. Crypto Garage has developed an expertise in smart contracts, small strings of programming that can be encoded into the bitcoin blockchain to run when activated.  The transaction needed to cross on the bitcoin blockchain, Goh said, because it's the most secure in the industry, even though smart contracts are generally considered easier to program on the ethereum network.  The transaction  So on Sept. 6, Goh says, he took some British pounds from an in-house research-and-development fund at skew. converted those into bitcoin, and then used the proceeds to buy 10 S&P 500 call spreads – a popular type of option – from Crypto Garage, all under a new smart contract, with terms agreed to by both counterparties in minutes. The expiration date for the options was set for the third Friday of the month, similar to the standard practice on many exchanges.  At the outset, Skew. paid an option premium of 0.0202 bitcoin ($217 at the time) via the smart contract, and Crypto Garage posted 0.04667 bitcoin as collateral.  On Sept. 20, the expiration date, the smart contract automatically used a price feed from Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange (parent company of the New York Stock Exchange) to establish the final price for the S&P 500.  The trade went in skew.'s favor, resulting in a payout of 0.036 bitcoin ($365 at the time). Crypto Garage got 0.01 bitcoin of its collateral back. (Skew later sent some money back to Crypto Garage, as a true-up.)  Above is an image produced with data from the bitcoin blockchain – the trade settlement, at expiry. Initially daunting, it's the elegant simplicity here that is the promise of a blockchain-driven future.  At the top, that string of letters and numbers in blue is the ID number for the transaction. On the left, the blue string is the address where the collateral is stored, and the white number is the amount of collateral, in BTC. On the right, the top blue string is the address of the winning counterparty in the trade, which got back the white number of bitcoin, and the blue address just below that is for the losing counterparty, which gets back the leftover collateral. In yellow, on the lower right, it shows that the transaction was confirmed 2068 times by the blockchain and then the yellow number of bitcoin is the total BTC proceeds distributed to the two counterparties from the collateral, after deducting the fees.  Scaling limitations  For Goh, the big takeaway from the exercise is that it worked.  ""The trade settlement took 45 minutes to process, with total transaction costs equal to a few U.S. dollars,"" he said. ""The smart contract knows exactly how much the parties will get back.""  In theory, he says, the cost would have remained the same even if the notional amount of the trade had stretched into the millions or billions of dollars.  The important part, he says, is that ""you don't have all the intermediaries.""  Could the new process be scaled up to handle the volume of S&P options trades currently handled by securities firms? Probably not without improvements to the bitcoin blockchain's processing capacity, Goh says. But a lot of programmers are working on doing just that.  In the annals of technological breakthroughs, it's not exactly Ben Franklin hanging a key on the end of a kite.

42431069,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzZRh,1570550428,State-Owned French Bank Joins Bitcoin Startup's $8 Million Series A,"“We’re convinced that bitcoin is becoming more and more obvious.”  That’s not typically what one might expect to hear from a veteran banker at a public institution. But Veronique Jacq of the partially state-owned French investment bank Bpifrance told CoinDesk bitcoin is becoming a staple of the global economy.  That’s why Bpifrance just made its first investment in a crypto startup, because the bank wants to play an active role in building bitcoin’s infrastructure.  The lightning-focused startup ACINQ raised an $8 million Series A led by Idinvest Partners, with the participation of Serena and Bpifrance. Idinvest Partners managing director Nicolas Debock told CoinDesk this round was also his firm’s first investment in a bitcoin company.  “As we continue to look at bitcoin companies, we think that second-layer opportunities are a big one and it’s definitely something we’ll be looking into more,” Debock said, adding:  “If you’re building for the digital economy … you need to build a strong and safe infrastructure. What I really like [about ACINQ] is they are not rushing to launch a product that isn’t ready.”  From Debock’s perspective, earlier waves of investment in the bitcoin economy revolved around mining companies, then exchanges and wallet providers. But traditional firms, like Idinvest, were wary of the “timing game” required to make significant returns on projects that are still subject to the erratic whims of an immature market and an opaque regulatory climate.  By contrast, he said, investing in companies with a long-term focus on the application layer offers a more palatable opportunity.  “If lightning lives up to its promise, it’s going to relay a lot of transactions,” Debock said. “When you relay a lot of transactions there are always ways to make money.”  Jacq agreed that although ACINQ’s business model is still unclear, she sees it as one of the leading startups focused on the lightning network protocol.  “The lightning network will be where high volumes of transactions could develop in the future, so we wanted to be there, with the infrastructure that will enable these transactions,” she said.  In a press statement, Serena partner Kamel Zeroual echoed his peers, explaining why a government bank would want to invest in developing layers of the bitcoin ecosystem:  “In a context of currency wars and negative interest rates, Bitcoin’s value proposition – a free, independent currency with an issuance policy set in its protocol – is impossible to ignore. All that it needs to achieve its goals is a sound, usable scalability solution.”  Dark horse  This Series A brings ACINQ’s total funding up to $10 million, CEO Pierre-Marie Padiou told CoinDesk, and will be used to grow the six-man team up to a dozen employees over the next year.  “We’re very picky about the people we hire … because it’s very hard to find people with the right skills,” Padiou told CoinDesk. “We are looking for people but … we will take however long it takes.”  Stepping back, ACINQ has long been the quietest pillar of the lightning startup trinity, with much of the community development spearheaded by Lightning Labs and Blockstream, both in Silicon Valley. Yet ACINQ has its own lightning implementation, Eclair, in addition to the Eclair mobile wallet, and Strike, an application program interface (API) for lightning, which Padiou compared to the merchant payment processing provider Stripe. He also said the Eclair lightning wallet has garnered 15,000 downloads via Google Play since it launched in 2018.  To date, ACINQ operates the largest capacity lightning node on the network, supporting over 1,000 channels. Blockstream engineer Rusty Russell told CoinDesk he thinks such diverse implementations benefit end-users since it’s unclear how the network will evolve.  “I started working on Bitcoin because of a previous Open Source project which made my career: Linux. And the one thing we learned from that journey is that we're not going where we think we're going,” Russell said, adding:  “Since we don't know where we're going, the more experimentation the merrier. … From my vantage point [ACINQ is] helping with the standards process. They're absolutely equal partners. Their style is less flashy, but they are going to continue to be a major player in the space and I expect great things to come.”  Mobile and approachable  As for ACINQ, Padiou said his startup is focused on mobile devices and payments.  “It’s important because maybe the protocol is the same but we have different views on what we want to optimize more,” he said. “It allows anyone to build software that fits their needs.”  Idinvest’s Debock said institutions can view lightning as a “broader application” of bitcoin’s potential, a space ripe for more traditional equity deals.  As such, ACINQ engineer Bastien Teinturier told CoinDesk that courting investors beyond crypto circles can benefit the entire industry.  “Bpifrance investing is an even bigger shift: public institutions are acknowledging the importance of this technology and its future relevance,” he said. “They aren't trying to shut it down, they aren't ignoring it either, they want to understand it and potentially work with it.”  Although Teinturier expressed gratitude for the public outreach done by the teams at Blockstream and Lightning Labs – like running community Slack channels, live demonstrations and conferences – his smaller team prefers to minimize its media exposure for the near future.  “We want to be able to offer a great UX for private, reliable, instant payments, that even your grandmother could use,” Teinturier said, adding:  “We're not there yet and we want to make sure we can deliver on that promise before we spend time communicating about it.”  ACINQ CEO Pierre-Marie Padiou image via YouTube",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/08/state-owned-french-bank-joins-bitcoin-startups-8-million-series-a,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a84e516dce4bd3141d63b059d822baf4e60a5d40-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As the story itself noted, it was only attempted.    ---------    Someone attempted to tamper with West Virginia’s blockchain-based voting pilot.  Disclosed for the first time via public address on Wednesday, West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner said there was an unsuccessful attempt to breach the pilot program, dubbed the ""military mobile voting solution,"" during the 2018 election cycle.  Though specifics cannot be revealed while the incident is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Warner said “no votes were altered, impacted, viewed or in any way tampered with.”  Developed by Medici-backed blockchain startup Voatz, the mobile app maker was tapped to provide citizens and military personnel deployed overseas a secure way to vote. The app uses facial and thumbprint recognition and stores voter-verified ballot receipts on an immutable ledger.  ""The system worked as designed and intended. The attempt was detected, thwarted at the gate and reported to the authorities,"" Voatz CEO Nimit Sawhney told CoinDesk.  To date, the startup has conducted more than 31 pilots, including an implementation in Denver, Colorado's municipal elections this past May. It completed a $7 million Series A in June.  The hackers’ IP addresses were turned over to the FBI, who will determine if crimes were committed.

The sale kicks off Oct. 16, aiming to raise an undisclosed amount within two weeks through the CoinList platform. The token sale is available to retail investors in some jurisdictions, excluding the U.S., China, Japan and Korea. It is only available to accredited investors in the U.S.  So far, venture firm Polychain Capital confirmed to CoinDesk it will contribute $5.7 million to the token offering, in addition to previous investments.  Nervos project co-founder Kevin Wang told CoinDesk that the Hong Kong-based China Merchants Bank International (CMBI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Merchants Bank, also committed to contribute an undisclosed amount to the token offering. For context, CMBI isn’t directly owned by the government the way the Bank of China is. Instead, its top 10 shareholders include at least seven corporations that are partially or fully owned by the state.  With regards to the bank’s political context, the Wall Street Journal reported diplomatic tensions over alleged sanctions violations raised the possibility that Chinese banks could someday be shut out of the dollar economy, as sanctioned Iranian banks already are. Perhaps this is part of the reason why the Chinese outlet Chain News reported CMBI was investing in Nervos to build an “open” platform and a “new investment bank.”  CMBI could not be reached for comment. We will update the article if we hear back.  Although Wang couldn’t specify what that bank’s plans might be, he told CoinDesk:  “CMBI is a strategic partner, both in terms of financial plans and other types of applications they want to utilize for the blockchain. … We want to make sure they can utilize the infrastructure.”  The upcoming offering won’t be the first time CMBI invested in Nervos tokens. Wang said his token project’s $28 million fundraise in 2018, which included CMBI and Sequoia China, was actually a private sale with contracts guaranteeing 14 percent of the initial token distribution in late 2019.  Press interviews  with the Nervos team about this investment described it as a “partnership” aimed at building “decentralized applications.”  Meanwhile, the crypto exchange giant Huobi, is partnering with the Nervos Foundation to create a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that could provide easier capital flows between cryptocurrencies.  Wang said the Nervos platform will be a neutral, “publicly owned” infrastructure that supports “other blockchains that are more regulatory compliant.” Speaking of these various compatible blockchains scheduled for implementation after mainnet launch in Q4 2019, Wang added:  “They are basically gateways that real-world assets can flow into. Then they will also be running on top of … the bigger ecosystem of Nervos, so that assets can also flow into the permissionless side of the infrastructure and enjoy the wider ecosystem of services, like DeFi services.”  'Truly unique'  Even if these partners create a system for capital flows, decentralization is an ambitious goal at best. The Nervos team still needs to get enough miners and node operators to make the system censorship-resistant through diversification.  The foundation’s roadmap implies 23.5 percent of the initial token supply (which will have control mechanisms but no finite cap) is designated to incentivize open-source contributions and business partnerships.  Polychain Capital president Joseph Eagan told CoinDesk it’s too early to decide whether his hedge fund will run a node or mine cryptocurrency for the Nervos project. But, he added, this could turn out to be one of the fund’s most lucrative investments.  “It’s one of our highest conviction projects, not just in Asia but globally,” Eagan said.  Describing how Nervos combines some of bitcoin’s layered scaling approach to ethereum’s malleable smart contracts, he added:  “I think the ability to create smart contracts similar to ethereum is very compelling. … From a technological perspective, Nervos and the underlying token offer something truly unique.”  Indeed, institutions aren’t the only players taking note of this token offering. At least four established crypto mining pools participated in the most recent testnet competition before the sale, including F2Pool and Sparkpool, two of the largest mining pools in the ethereum community. Wang said this should motivate future node operators.  In contrast, the bitcoin network expanded slowly, quietly, over several years before it attracted lucrative speculation. Even a few hundred nascent network participants would struggle to resist capture from nation-state actors, which calls the “public” aspect of the project into question.  On the other hand, CMBI isn’t the only bank aiming to tap into the crypto ecosystem. WEG Bank AG in Germany is exploring direct conduits to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), since two of its shareholders work with or partially own DEX startups. The exchange giant Binance, in addition to working on a DEX of its own, is also a shareholder in the upcoming Founders Bank in Malta.  Plus, Polychain's Eagan said it’s too soon to assume traditional institutions will become prominent users of the upcoming Nervos platform.  “It’s often one to two years later that developers really start to use those protocols,” Eagan said. “I still think we’re in ‘wait and see’ mode as to who the primary users will be.”  Update (Oct. 8, 12:50 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify the terms of the token offering.

The new node will process transactions faster because of its larger memory unit (4 GB versus the current node’s 1 GB), better processor and new software, Casa CEO Jeremy Welch told CoinDesk.  Also, unlike the current version, the new node will have a built-in BTCPay server, a self-hosted crypto payment processor for accepting bitcoin payments, Welch said. New features are expected to make the whole experience of opening lightning channels and sending funds much smoother, he said, adding:  “It’s like going from iPhone 3 to iPhone 11.”  The new node has been about six months in the making and comes in response to a growing community of lightning users, Welch said.  This community, according to Welch, ranges “from young software engineers to older people, from doctors to students.”  Since the company started selling the lightning nodes last fall, Casa has shipped over 2,000 devices to buyers in over 65 countries, according to Welch. The firm, however, can’t see where all these nodes ended up plugging into the network.  “The beautiful thing is, we have no idea where all these nodes are,"" Welch said. ""They are connecting via Tor – it’s all about privacy protection.""  Lightning is an experimental network for faster bitcoin transactions, allowing users to open channels between each other by staking the bitcoin they want to use. Only the final settlement results – not each small transaction – are recorded onto the bitcoin blockchain.

42431075,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzZdh,1570532414,Bitcoin Eyes $8.5K Hurdle After Biggest Single-Day Price Gain in Five Weeks,"View  Bitcoin could test key resistance above $8,500 in the next day or two, having eked out the biggest single-day rise in five weeks on Monday.  The daily chart indicators have turned bullish with Monday's price rise.  Acceptance below the 100-week moving average (MA) at $7,756 would revive the case for a drop to $7,200.      Bitcoin (BTC) logged the biggest single-day price gain in five weeks on Monday, opening doors for a stronger recovery rally to key resistance above $8,500.  The top cryptocurrency by market value bounced up from a historically strong 100-week MA support near $7,750 and closed (UTC) at $8,205 on Bitstamp, representing a 4.47 percent gain on the daily opening price of $7,863. That is the biggest single-day price rise since Sept. 2.  Back then, BTC had rallied by 6.3 percent, confirming a short-term bullish reversal. The breakout, however, ended up creating a bearish lower high near $10,950 on Sept. 6.  Monday's price rise could be termed as a relief rally, as the cryptocurrency was looking oversold, having dropped by more than $2,000 in the last week of September. Further, there were signs of seller exhaustion below $7,800, as discussed yesterday.  Many observers believe the recovery rally could be extended further to resistances lined up above $8,500 and near $8,600. For instance, market analyst Josh Rager tweeted earlier today that bitcoin price could now run up to $8,500.  Rager warned in another tweet that prices need to rise above $8,500 to invalidate bearish lower highs set up and confirm a bullish reversal.  Popular analyst @TheCryptoDog believes the probability of a sell-off to $7,200 has dropped with Monday's 4.47 percent price rise and a bigger rally to $9,400 could be seen if resistance at $8,500 is convincingly breached.  As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands near $8,200 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $8,344.  Daily candlestick and line charts  Bitcoin created a bullish outside bar candlestick pattern on Monday (above left), which occurs when the day begins on a pessimistic note, but ends with optimism, engulfing preceding day's high and low.  The outside bar candle is widely considered an early sign of bullish reversal, especially when it appears at the bottom of an established downtrend or a notable price drop. In BTC's case, the candle has appeared following a drop from $10,000 to $7,715.  Further, the MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend strength and trend changes, has crossed above zero, confirming a bullish reversal.  Meanwhile, the daily line chart (above right) is reporting a bullish divergence of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI).  A bullish divergence occurs when the RSI produces higher lows, contradicting lower lows on the price chart. It is considered an advance warning of an impending bullish move.  All-in-all, BTC looks set to challenge Oct. 1's high of $8,531 in the short-term. A UTC close above that level would invalidate the bearish lower highs pattern, as tweeted by Josh Rager, and confirm a breakout on the intraday chart, as seen below.  6-hour chart  BTC is charting a double bottom pattern with the neckline resistance at $8,531. A break higher would confirm a breakout and create room for a rise to $9,348 (target as per the measured move method).  That said, more credible evidence of a bullish reversal would be a break above the 200-day MA, currently lined up at $8,586.  This is due to the fact that the 200-day MA is widely considered as a barometer of a long-term trend and served as strong resistance on Oct. 1.  The case for a drop to $7,200 would strengthen if prices find acceptance under the 100-week MA at $7,756, as discussed yesterday, although as of now that looks unlikely.

42431071,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzZVh,1570525224,Bitcoin's Dropping Lightning Capacity Might Not Be a Bad Thing,"If you're a fan of bitcoin and the nascent Lightning network, this graph looks disheartening at first glance.  The lightning network is supposed to be bitcoin's superhero, taking the cryptocurrency to new heights by tackling its toughest and most obvious problem: if cryptocurrency is ever going to ""go mainstream,"" it needs to support a million times more transactions than it currently does – which is no easy feat.  But by the looks of this graph, lightning appears to be losing momentum. The amount of funds locked up in the layer-two network looks to be decreasing, seeming to indicate that fewer people are using it as a payment method. A lightning ""channel"" is like a gateway to the rest of the network, allowing a user to send a payment to any other user.  While lightning is still considered ""beta"" software, and thus risky to use, bitcoiners have been so enthusiastic about it and using it anyway, for games and beyond, chanting the unofficial slogan ""reckless."" As lightning's capacity increased rapidly over its first year, devotees cheered it on social media.  The catch is that, while this number is decreasing, lightning use might actually still be increasing because of increased privacy of lightning channels and other channel optimizations.  ""There's no way of knowing the capacity in [the lightning network]. We can only know the public channels' capacity, not private,"" Roy Sheinfeld, CEO of Breez told CoinDesk.  And at least one company says that – at least in their experience – lightning payments are picking up.  ""We are doing increasing dollar value volumes on the lightning network. What I am seeing is the price going up and thus people need less coins locked up in channels to maintain spending power,"" FastBitcoins MD Danny Brewster told CoinDesk.  A tale of two nodes  So, while so far watching this number has been a spectator sport -- football for tech geeks -- it might not be for much longer. This number will grow harder to track over time.  That's because many lightning wallets do not advertise whether their channels exist to the rest of the network, by default.  Under the hood, there are ""advertised"" channels which advertise their existence to the rest of the lightning network and ""non-advertised"" channels which don't. Normal channels, used by everyday users who just want to buy pizza and draw dicks online with lightning, don't need to be advertised.  ""Many wallets in the past few months have been released which default to non-advertised channels, these channels don't show up on any public metrics, so relying on the public metrics alone only really shows half of the picture,"" Lightning Labs CTO Laolu Osuntokun told CoinDesk.  Generally, advertised channels only need to be used by routing nodes, so the sturdier nodes that get payments from one person to another and need to be online all the time.  Zap creator Jack Mallers argued ""it's only responsible"" that ""anyone who isn't a routing node [uses] private [""non-advertised""] channels.""  Some go as far as to argue that the public capacity is a ""useless indicator"" because it doesn't capture all – or maybe even most – of the money in the lightning network.  Because more apps have been starting to follow these best practices, Sheinfeld guesses that ""most"" channels are private, noting that his wallet Breez has opened ""thousands"" of private channels just in the last couple of months alone.  ""Breez opened thousands of private channels in the last two months. Lightning Labs auto-pilot also opens private channels,"" he said.  This is one reason why many developers see lightning as providing more privacy than on-chain bitcoin transactions. While bitcoin has a reputation for giving users anonymity, transactions are actually public. Lightning hides a bit more of the transaction details.  ""If a regular bitcoin transaction is similar to uploading your bank statement to a public web site, a lightning network transaction is similar to showing each merchant you pay how much money you have in one specific compartment of your wallet. You’re still revealing some information, but much less,"" as lightning startup SuredBits wrote.  Garbage day  Another reason the capacity is decreasing is because some entities are closing down lightning channels that were wasteful.  ""Based on my knowledge, the decrease in channels is simply node operators being rational by closing out channels that have been open for some time, but which don't have notable forwarding activity,"" Osuntokun said.  For instance, there's one famous and mysterious anonymous lightning user by the name of LNBIG who has opened many lightning channels. They initially debuted by pouring 300 bitcoin into the lightning network, giving new meaning to lightning's ""reckless"" catchphrase.  ""At the beginning of my activity, I opened many channels in the hope that they will be used (and due to the imperfection of the autopilot),"" the person behind LNBIG told CoinDesk.  But, the secretive developer said, those channels weren't really used much at all. They were just open and sitting there.  ""But time has shown that many channels have not been used once for two to four months, for example, and the funds in them are nonetheless blocked,"" LNBIG continued.  The funds are ""blocked,"" as LNBIG puts it, because of the way lightning works. A lightning ""channel"" is like a gateway to the rest of the network, allowing a user to send a payment to any other user. But when someone opens a ""channel"" with someone else and doesn't use it, then other people can't use that gateway.  So, it makes sense to free up that capacity and wait to see if a new channel opens want to use the capacity, which is exactly what LNBIG decided to do.  LNBIG posted a Twitter poll before following through with closing these channels, arguing that the only downside would be the ""psychological effect"" that lightning's capacity would fall down to 825 bitcoin.  As the decrease in lightning's capacity shows, Twitter encouraged LNBIG to follow through.

42431065,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzZNh,1570521603,"Foreign Exchange Giant CLS Admits: No, We Don’t Need a Blockchain for That","Blockchain technology is nice to have, but it’s hardly a must for rewiring the global financial markets.  So says Alan Marquard, chief strategy and development officer at CLS Group, the global utility for settling foreign exchange trades, owned by the 71 largest banks active in that market.  Nearly a year ago, it went live with CLSNet, touted as “the first global FX market enterprise application running on blockchain in production,” with megabanks Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of China (Hong Kong) on board.  CLSNet was built on Hyperledger Fabric, the enterprise blockchain platform developed by IBM. But a blockchain was not the obvious solution for netting down high volumes of FX trades in 120 currencies, Marquard said recently.  “I have been very clear from the first time we conceived of CLSNet, that it didn't have to be run on blockchain,” he told CoinDesk. “Blockchain is not essential for that process to run – or even to run well.”  CLS could have opted for “a centralized way of doing the calculations and pushing them back out,” but didn’t for a reason, Marquard said.  “We are pro-blockchain, don't get me wrong,” he said. “We wouldn't have put all the investment into standing up a blockchain if we didn't think that [it would have some benefit].”  (Marquard wouldn't say how big the investment was, but an industry source put it in the ""millions of pounds."")  Specifically, the benefit is having the output of the netting calculation on a blockchain so that both participants are definitely getting the same version. This is valuable, particularly with emerging market currencies where there are inefficiencies and potential for trades to break, Marquard said.  But blockchain was not the essential cost-saving element, he said.  “The more we drive netting into those currencies, the more people will save. So the service will save people money,” Marquard said, adding:  “Is that because of blockchain? No, I don't think, hand on heart, I can say that.”  Progress report  Since launch, two more banks – Bank of America and Intesa Sanpaolo – have joined CLSNet. Marquard said there will be a total of nine banks live on the platform this year.  “There are five [banks] live and there are four who have been through frustrating month by month ... almost there, almost there,” he said. “They will go live before year-end; they are all in the final stage of testing.”  All five participating banks declined to comment, as did IBM, which built the system.  According to Marquard, volumes on CLSNet are growing but not in any way comparable with the main CLS settlement system, which acts as the middleman settling trades in 18 major currencies.  “The volumes are amounts we are very happy with,” he said, declining to give a number. He pointed out that the big currency pairs like dollar/euro are already in the CLS settlement system and don’t require CLSNet, adding:  “How do you compete with $12.8 trillion on the main system? It's going to take years before we can get anywhere near that. I have no aspirations of CLSNet ever getting to the scale of the main settlement system.”  In fairness, the fact that it is in production sets CLSNet apart from most other enterprise blockchain projects which are at various stages of testing.  Meanwhile, CLS is doing analysis “in the background” to see if it could ultimately create some kind of settlement solution using blockchain, but Marquard said, “that's way, way off.”  He remains skeptical about the rhetoric from a few years ago about distributed ledger technology sweeping up and replacing large chunks of critical payments infrastructure.  “The big thing blockchain was going to do was the transfer of value, of money and assets, and get rid of all the payment systems. It was just silly,” he said. “It was a technologist's view of how markets function with very little understanding of those kinds of entities and how they operate.”  A thorough-going understanding has informed the gradual approach being taken with CLSNet, Marquard said, concluding:  “We knew that we couldn't do a settlement application. We wanted to do something on blockchain to help bring the technology forward, to help participants acclimatize to it and frankly just to keep ourselves in the conversation – which it has done.”  Currencies image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/08/foreign-exchange-giant-cls-admits-no-we-dont-need-a-blockchain-for-that,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55890fdf8e23d24f322dbc85fd184fdcd7a0411c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431070,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzZTh,1570514411,Hong Kong Securities Watchdog Issues Rules on Funds Investing in Crypto,"Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has issued regulations for fund managers investing in ""virtual assets.""  In an Oct. 4 announcement, the financial market watchdog formalized a framework put out in November last year that was aimed to regulate funds that allocate more than 10 percent of their portfolio in virtual assets.  The 37-page regulation, which is effective immediately, defines virtual assets as ""digital representations of value which may be in the form of digital tokens,"" such as digital currencies, utility tokens or security or asset-backed tokens.  It also includes any other virtual commodities, crypto assets or other assets of essentially the same nature, regardless of whether they fall under the definition of “securities” or “futures contracts” under the agency's existing ordinance.  Other than that, the document is fairly broad, as much of it follows existing regulations on fund-managers licensed by the SFC in general.  For instance, fund managers investing in crypto assets must have at least 3 million Hong Kong dollars ($382,000) of capital, similar to the minimal requirement for the SFC's type 9 (asset management) licensees. An independent compliance officer needs to be appointed, and detailed compliance procedures must be drafted.  Crypto fund managers must appoint a third-party custodian and the assets of the fund and the fund manager must be kept separate. Fiat currency must also be kept separate at a licensed Hong Kong financial institution or in a jurisdiction approved by the SFC.  When choosing a custodian, the fund manager must establish that the institution is capable of dealing with virtual assets and that it understands relevant concepts, such as wallets. The SFC does allow for self-custody if certain requirements are met.  In terms of trading, the SFC requires fund managers to conduct extensive due diligence on crypto exchanges before using any virtual asset trading platform.

42431072,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzZXh,1570507232,The Silver Lining in Block.One’s SEC 'Slap on the Wrist',"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      The only certain thing to say about the implications of any isolated Securities and Exchange Commission case is that it’s risky to assume it sets a precedent. That goes doubly for those in which a settlement is reached with no admission of guilt.  That hasn’t stopped loads of people in the crypto community armchair-analyzing last week’s news of Block.one’s paltry penalty from the SEC over its 2017 sale of EOS ERC-20 tokens. As lawyer Stephen Palley put it over at The Block, “some commentary was useful and a whole lot of it was, well, the kind of blather one expects.”  But that’s not to say one can’t or shouldn’t try to read some tea leaves out of a decision as stunning and historically significant as this one. And while, I’m no lawyer, I am going to go out on a limb and say that, on balance, there are elements in here that the crypto industry should be happy with.  Happiness is not the way many are feeling about this result. A host of crypto commentators are royally angry about it.  It seems many folks don’t like the Block.one crew. In addition to their disdain for the EOS’s blockchain’s governance challenges and the worrisome centralization of its network in China, many people also felt that the whopping $4 billion raised in the ICO was, well, obscene. To them, that fundraise tally was the high point – or more accurately, low point – of an ICO mania period that many in the community, rightly, want to put behind them.  Block.one’s $24 million payment  -- with no admission of guilt, and a waiver allowing it to continue to legitimately raise money through future securities issues -- represented a mere 0.6% of the ICO’s gargantuan raise. Lined up against up the $225,000 infines and disgorgement that blockchain-based storage provider Sia also agreed to pay in relation to its much smaller $120,000 unregistered securities sale, it just seemed so unfair.  Good lawyers are worth it – if you can afford them  Naturally, the announcement got people’s minds spinning. Why?  Was the soft penalty because Block.one had put geofencing in place and tried to keep its tokens out of the hands of Americans? Maybe. (Some argued that the $24 million fine is possibly about as much was raised from U.S. investors.)  Was it because the SEC now implicitly recognized that EOS has evolved into a decentralized platform and that the new, on-platform tokens into which the ERC-20 tokens were swapped, were not securities? Maybe. (Was this an application of the de facto “Hinman doctrine?"".)  Was there some other, unwritten deal kept off the public record? Who knows?  The reality is that the only reliable conclusion to draw from Block.one’s “victory” is that it pays to get good lawyers. Proof of that lies in the successful waiver request that Cooley lawyer Karen Ubell submitted on the company’s behalf, detailing the lengths to which Block.One has since gone to up its compliance game and do the right thing by the SEC.  As legal commentator Katherine Wu put it in a scribbled comment that was included in another one of her extremely useful post-decision annotation exercises, “Fuck man, their lawyers are good.”  One cynical conclusion to draw, then, is that the crypto startup community is now following the same norms as the Wall Street banks it seeks to dislodge. Here too, it seems, money buys protection, if not from the law per se but from the impediments to business that adverse rulings have on those of lesser means. It’s a melancholy thought for those who want this technology to lower barriers to entry and give scrappy garage-based startups a chance to change the world.  Clues in cooperation  But I also think the negativity slung at Block.one in this instance is excessive. There’s too much desire for schadenfreude in this industry; when people are looking for blood and it’s not delivered, their disappointment is palpable.  A more upbeat view is possible. And it’s also formed from the waiver letter. While its words are those of a Block.one lawyer, not an SEC representative, the letter’s details hint at what the SEC could be looking for from token-issuing entities. Here, it’s important to note that the Cooley letter came, in Udell’s words, after “settlement discussions with the SEC” – a line that Wu annotated with the observation that the two sides had “def been back & forth for a hot minute….” That suggests its contents captured agreed-to-elements that formed the SEC’s implicit quid pro quo for its light touch.  With that in mind, the part of the letter that jumped out at me lay in the section detailing Block.one’s cooperative position with the SEC – one adopted in stark contrast with the team from Kik, who have angrily refused to settle over their ICO and are going to court with the SEC.  It’s the section where the Cooley team highlights Block.one’s work on “technological mechanisms” regarding the token it plans to issue for its decentralized media project, Voice.  These include mechanisms aimed at cutting-edge “identity verification and transfer restrictions that could be used to support compliance with securities laws” in the future, and others that could “ensure that future tokens are only provided to individuals in jurisdictions where it has been confirmed that implementation of such token will be fully compliant with all applicable regulations.”  On all these matters, the letter said, “Block.one is initiating a process of consultation and discussion with staff of the Division, including the SEC’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub).”  Signs of openness to innovation  There’s a positive takeaway here about the SEC. The Commission has been maddeningly on the fence, or at least stubbornly silent, on how or whether it should embrace some of the more innovative compliance solutions for strengthening security while reducing friction in science.  Yet here, in a way, we have evidence that the SEC is not only open to innovation but willing even to reward transgressors who help them get their heads around that innovation.  Regulators are an unavoidable reality for startups looking to use blockchain technology to disrupt the old order. Their best hope is not to ignore them, fight them, or try to evade them, but to help them work with the crypto community’s developers to employ some of the incredible cryptographic solutions now at hand to design a more inclusive, less friction-filled financial system.  Block.one might well have gotten less than it deserves. But its approach with government is worth following.
