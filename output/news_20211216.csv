42424090,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2k2Bh,1639697400,First Mover Asia: Crypto Rally Fizzles Amid Widespread Inflationary Concerns,"(Edited by James Rubin)  Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin’s relief rally” appears to be temporary, after major central banks announced plans to battle high inflation  Technician’s take: Bitcoin could see a brief price bounce, although sellers remain in control.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $47, 683 -2.3%  Ether (ETH): $3,981 -1.54%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,668 -0.8%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $35,896 -0.08%  Nasdaq: $15,180 -2.4%  Gold: $1,798 +1%  Market moves  Bitcoin’s “relief rally” after the U.S. Federal Reserve officials approved the acceleration of its plan to withdraw the pandemic stimulus efforts appeared to be short-lived, as the oldest cryptocurrency dropped below $48,000 on Thursday.  The drop came after major U.S. stock indexes fell amid plans by Europe’s top central banks to battle high inflation. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined, the Nasdaq by over 2%.  “Bitcoin and [Big Tech] are getting punished today as investors reallocate some of their more profitable risky bets,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst of the Americas at OANDA, wrote in his newsletter. “The crypto space is seeing a lot of repositioning and that is leading to some unwanted selling pressure, but the medium- and -long-term outlooks remain firmly in place.”  Bitcoin’s spot trading volume across major centralized exchanges was also low on Thursday.  Alternative cryptocurrencies also fell. Ether dropped below $4,000 again and yesterday’s biggest winners including solana and avalanche were in the red too, at the time of publication.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Oversold Near $46K Support; Resistance at $55K  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold support above $46,000, which is near its 200-day moving average. The cryptocurrency could see a brief price bounce toward $55,000 if buyers react to oversold signals on the charts.  Price momentum is starting to turn positive on the daily chart for the first time since October, which preceded a price recovery. This time, however, the uptrend is slowing on the weekly chart, which means upside could be limited beyond $55,000 to $60,000.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is the most oversold since late September, although buying has been weak relative to prior RSI signals.

42390138,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUtbp7,1639691472,Should Crypto and Porn Get Intimate?,"When I think about culture, I think sex, drugs and rock and roll. Given that bitcoin found its first true use as a medium of exchange on popular (now-defunct) darknet market Silk Road, and the explosion of interest in music-geared NFTs and crypto brands, it’s safe to say crypto is becoming a cultural force. CoinDesk’s Layer 2 has a whole package on that theme running this week. But what of sex?  Last summer, when OnlyFans decided to boot sex workers off its platform (basically used for holding intimate meetings between creators and fans) many made the call for the adult industry to embrace cryptocurrency. The site, which at the time and is currently filled entirely with bespoke porn, almost killed that business line at the behest of banks. At the last second, OnlyFans reversed course.  This article is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment. It published first in The Node newsletter, which you can subscribe to here.  The situation revealed how clearly crypto could benefit the adult industry. Crypto’s technological innovation is pretty simple when it comes down to it: distributed, digital tools are difficult to censor or stop. For an industry that’s routinely under fire by socially conservative moralists, having a little resilience to censorship could help.  “Independence and counterculture. That is what the two industries have in common,” Deborah Sundahl, a celebrated author and leading expert on female ejaculation, told CoinDesk in an email.  There are a number of crypto platforms built with sex in mind. SpankChain, founded by Ameen Soleimani, wants to be the go-to tool for buying anything from naughty videos to sex swings. Bits and Chains is a wallet that lets sex workers take greater control over their BTC. LiveStars launched on Ethereum as a sexy streaming platform and social network. Individual creators also benefited from this year’s NFT revolution; auctioning off “thirst traps” and nudes for hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars.  Then there are industry heavyweights like Pornhub, one of the most traffic sites online, period, which moved to only accept cryptocurrency payments in 2020. This came after feeling pressure from traditional payments operators like Visa and PayPal.  Playboy, the “men’s lifestyle” brand, has long experimented with crypto. A few years ago, they issued the “vice industries token” that would power a “video entertainment platform” with crypto as its native currency. This year, Playboy issued a rabbit-themed non-fungible token (NFT) set and is supporting a more cerebral meditation on “the art of gender and sexuality.”  A host of smaller sites either launched with or incorporated crypto as a payment option. Some – like Strip 4 Bit, Xotica, Tits For Bitcoin – build bitcoin into their brands, following a long lineage of punny porn titles.  But here’s the nut. As intimate as crypto and porn are, most of these services are hardly used. To the extent that Spankchain is discussed, it’s usually by media publications by people with a financial stake in $SPANK making the same case that I’m laying down: that crypto and porn should intermingle, not that they have. It’s been slow going, at the very least.  For instance, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee said, the “[$97 billion] porn industry is definitely a leading indicator of technology adoption … I’m glad to see them opening up to cryptocurrency.” That was in 2018, when Pornhub first announced it would integrate the altcoin Verge (out of all coins) for payments. Has the industry really developed much further since then?  Porn is often celebrated for driving technological adoption. There’s good evidence that the home-tape standard VHS beat out the more-established Betamax because it was the preferred option for the porn industry. It’s an industry that was early on “independent cinemas” and DVDs, too.  “They took new technology and made a product out of it. Practical use. Innovative. It would be very, very interesting to know what they are doing now with blockchain, payment systems and who knows what else,” the ejaculate scholar Sundahl said, referring to the innovators in the adult industry.  Innovation  For one thing, it’s possible that most of the innovation with crypto is happening behind closed doors, so to say. Crypto is a powerful tool for online creators, those who strike out on their own to build brands and businesses independent of larger structures. Porn is seeing a similar fragmentation and specialization as elsewhere on the web – there are more independent creators than ever.  Crypto could empower sex workers unaffiliated with talent managers to publish content that is a little much even for sites like Pornhub, which has certain regulations and stipulations. So those with particular fetishes – like really particular – might be willing to go through the process of paying with crypto if they’re already forced to use a specific site for their desires.  Plus, crypto provides a certain level of anonymity. It’s exceedingly difficult for anyone, even platform managers, to gauge how many individuals are using crypto services because not every address corresponds to a unique user. This semi-privacy is attractive for buyers and sellers, for pretty obvious reasons.  To the extent that crypto-tools are helping sex workers diversify their revenue streams or opt out of fiat-payment systems (Mastercard could drop anyone at a nickel), it remains to be seen whether crypto-sex tie ups can ever go mainstream. (Not that a niche industry should set that as its objective.)  Many popular social apps, including SnapChat and Tumblr, basically used sex as a test subject. Users embraced them for their lax standards on nudity. Communities formed, platforms scaled – only for porn to later be purged.  It’s easy to write off Christian moralizers like Exodus Cry, the group that led the effort against OnlyFans, as out of touch. But there are lots of good reasons why the adult industry should have some form of oversight. So far, no one has figured out how platforms can weed out abuse, exploitation and human trafficking without harming the vast majority of well-intentioned creators.  See also: Porn, Mastercard Moderation and How Bitcoin Doesn’t Fix It  Many popular social apps, including SnapChat and Tumblr, basically used sex as a test subject when getting started. Users embraced them for their lax standards on nudity. Communities formed, platforms scaled – only for porn to later be purged. That’s because it was difficult to manage things like age restrictions and FOSTA/SESTA regulations while keeping the platform open for all.  Crypto platforms, in theory dedicated to open source/open access, have a ready-made answer to people or governments looking to censor abuse claims of copyright infringement: that you must take the good with the bad. When it comes to human rights violations that may not be a satisfactory answer. And, in reality, it’s more often just a bit of mental masturbation, as plenty of crypto projects have been willing to give up the pretense of decentralization to reverse transactions, block content and uphold copyrights. (You might ask, what’s the point of crypto then?)  Clearly, crypto is not a perfect solution. But to the extent that it’s helping people explore their boundaries, it’s a good thing. It’s perfectly OK for some things to stay niche.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/16/should-crypto-and-porn-get-intimate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/720b7da51147e6147f35f8c76525c6b9de4a2071-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424085,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2k21h,1639691227,Federal Regulator Says Credit Unions Can Partner With Crypto Providers,"Federally insured credit unions (FICUs) can partner with third-party digital asset service providers, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) announced Thursday.  “This includes facilitating member relationships with third parties that allow FICU members to buy, sell and hold various uninsured digital assets with the third-party provider outside of the FICU,” according to the statement from the NCUA. The NCUA is a U.S. regulator that oversees credit unions, acting as a counterpart to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which regulates national banks.  The NCUA said it wants to offer clarity around the existing authority that FICUs have when it comes to building relationships with third-party digital asset providers. The NCUA said further guidance may be necessary as digital assets and technologies evolve, and the association will continue to study and address issues that arise.  Kyle Hauptman, vice chair of NCUA, said the guidance was the result of two things that have been happening in the marketplace.  “Credit unions have been watching endless outflows of cash to crypto exchanges, and many people would rather use their primary financial institution for their first foray into crypto investing,” Hauptman told CoinDesk. “Today’s guidance helps both concerns and gives a new revenue stream to credit unions [that] want to try it out. Financial services has always been ‘adapt or die’ and I don’t want credit unions to go the way of Blockbuster Video because we, the regulators, prevented innovation.”  Federal credit unions may continue to act as finders to bring together their members with providers of third-party services, including those related to digital assets, the NCUA added.  In July, the NCUA published a request for information (RFI) after its three board members unanimously voted to do so.

42424087,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2k27h,1639689377,Market Wrap: Altcoins Outperform as Ether Rises Toward $4K,"Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) were in the spotlight on Thursday as bullish sentiment returned to crypto markets. Bitcoin (BTC) continued to stabilize near $46,000, near its 200-day moving average – a key technical support level that, if broken, could lead to further selling pressure.  For now, bitcoin appears to be oversold, and was down about 2% over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, ether (ETH) was roughly flat over the past 24 hours, compared with a 4% rise in Solana’s SOL token and a 7% rise in Terra’s LUNA token over the same period.  Some analysts say the bullish market response to Wednesday’s Fed decision could be short-lived. The U.S. Federal Reserve announced an accelerated winding down of asset purchases, which was widely expected among market participants.  “Long-term investors should not lose sight of the natural tightening of financial conditions because of these moves, which will slowly but persistently reduce demand for risky assets,” Alex Kuptsikevich, analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “The main risk for the crypto market is that we have seen a monetary regime switch in the last couple of months, which promises to take some of the demand for crypto away.”  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $47,944, -2.80%  Ether (ETH): $4,022, -1.04%  S&P 500: $4,668, -0.88%  Gold: $1,799, +1.10%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.43%  Ether holds support  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, briefly touched $4,000 on Thursday after several weeks of choppy trading. The cryptocurrency is down about 4% over the past month, compared with a 20% decline in BTC.  ETH has support around its 100-day moving average (currently at $3,900), which could stabilize short-term pullbacks. The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is also the most oversold since late September, which preceded a price rally. Still, similar to bitcoin, upside appears to be limited around the $4,800 ETH all-time price high.  Altcoin roundup  Institutions eye Avalanche: Crypto custody firm BitGo will support AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, in the latest sign of institutional interest in the high-speed blockchain. The news from BitGo comes after Bank of America analysts said Avalanche could be a viable alternative to Ethereum for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs and gaming. It also opens the door for BitGo clients, including exchanges Bitstamp and Bitbuy, to offer AVAX to their users, CoinDesk’s Eli Tan reported.

The feature will be operational for all customers starting Dec. 22, except those in Nevada and Hawaii, where Robinhood Crypto is not available.  Users can send as little as $1 worth of one of seven cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and dogecoin (DOGE). The gift cards come with special designs and can be accompanied by a personal message. There is no commission for gifting crypto.  Once sent, the recipient has 14 days to accept the gift. If it’s not accepted, the money reverts back to the sender. If the recipient is a Robinhood customer, they will receive the gift in the app. If they are not, they can sign up for an account and then claim it.  “Crypto gifting is a great way for our customers to help remove the emotional and economic barrier of their friends and family taking their first step into crypto,” Robinhood Crypto Chief Operating Officer Christine Brown said via email. “It is also an easy and immediate gift for those that are already crypto fans.”  Commissions from crypto trading have become an increasingly significant source of revenue for Robinhood in recent quarters.

42407250,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUKXJp,1639687236,What’s Next for Friends With Benefits?,"Crypto has always had an accessibility problem.  It goes without saying that this stuff is difficult to use. It’s one thing to buy some Ethereum on Coinbase –it’s another to actually step beyond that walled garden into the world of decentralized applications, where you won’t find any guardrails to help you along the way. You’ll need an unhosted wallet (which you control rather than a third party), for starters, along with an intimate knowledge of token swaps (what’s “slippage” all about?) and plenty of cash on hand for the network’s exorbitant fees.  This feature is part of Crypto 2022: Culture Week.  But the challenge of actually navigating these systems is almost secondary to the issue of cultural accessibility.  The dominant culture of crypto in 2021 is, to quote the writer Max Read, “unbelievably alienating” to a large subsection of the population. Today, the conversation has more to do with NFTs and Ethereum than the Bitcoin- and privacy-centric values of the Silk Road era. And the constant evangelizing that’s become par for the course in this emergent space – those utopian promises of a more democratic internet – can feel grating to the uninitiated. It doesn’t help that the oh-so-lovable Mark Zuckerberg is now closely linked to the idea of the “metaverse,” or that the dominant aesthetic around non-fungible tokens (think: the cartoonish grotesquerie of Bored Ape Yacht Club and its derivatives) has become something of a joke outside of crypto.  This has made it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap between crypto people and non-crypto people (you might hear them referred to as “normies,” in a nod to the 4chan lexicon). Mainstream adoption is happening, little by little, but “getting into crypto” can still feel like learning a second language. Communities of rabid, like-minded early adopters are everywhere. What sort of people might be drawn to a more sober approach?  This is one of the animating questions behind Friends With Benefits, a kind of crypto-backed social club and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Over the past year, the community has evolved from a small group chat into a burgeoning media empire, with around 2,000 members and eight full-time staffers.  It’s still also a group chat, but its ambit is much broader: FWB is a music discovery platform, an online publication, a startup incubator and a kind of Bloomberg terminal for crypto investors. It’s setting up community hubs in major cities across the globe; it throws parties with Yves Tumor and Erykah Badu. And maybe most crucially, it raised $10 million in financing from the powerhouse venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, cementing its position as one of today’s most powerful online crypto communities.  Also, it’ll cost you anywhere between $5,000 and $10,000 to join.  A victim of its success?  Seventy-five of the group’s home-brewed crypto tokens ($FWB) gets you access to the main attraction: the group’s sprawling, multifarious Discord server, with dedicated chat rooms for everything from memes and new music to the intricacies of crypto trading. One $FWB token currently costs about $77, but the price is constantly fluctuating. It was $95 earlier this week and around $150 in late October.  There’s also a formal application process for membership. Before you buy the tokens, you’ll need to be approved by a committee of current members. Hundreds of these applications come in every day.  Read more: Matt Leising - From DOH! to DAO: The Rise of Decentralized Organizations  “Core in our principles and our values is that crypto should be the least interesting thing about you,” said Alex Zhang, who quit his day job this summer to become the official “Mayor” of Friends With Benefits (he manages the day-to-day operations of the community).  That’s reflected in the diversity of channels in the Discord. There’s one called “selfies-n-fits,” where members strategize about how to snag designer clothing online, and another called “parenting,” where people just chat about their kids. In the city-specific channels, people organize community events and share intel on their favorite local spots. A “learning” section hosts channels dedicated to crypto taxes, the metaverse and more general Web 3 tutorials for an audience with a range of crypto and non-crypto backgrounds. (FWB gave me access through a tokenless “press pass” role on Discord – I’m not a stakeholder.)  But FWB isn’t “$5,000+ or bust.” The group’s token-gating system works in tiers. One $FWB gets you access to the group’s newsletter but nothing else. Five $FWB gets you access to a global network of token-gated parties, which have quickly developed their own cachet in the NFT space.  For its party timed to the NFT.NYC conference in early November, the group brought out Caroline Polachek, the Russian art collective Pussy Riot (with whom they’ve collaborated on NFT drops) and the electronic producer Doss. Yves Tumor performed at FWB’s Miami event in June, and Erykah Badu and Azealia Banks did sets at FWB’s next big Miami party, during the week of Art Basel.  These are the kinds of artists you’re more likely to find on critics’ year-end roundups – adventurous, well-regarded musicians with roots outside of tech – than in crypto Discord channels. According to Zhang, that’s by design.  “We’re conscious about booking Azealia Banks and Erykah Badu in terms of what that signals versus, like, ‘insert white DJ’ that might be more crypto savvy,” he said. “But we’re teaching Badu about tokens and onboarding her, and she’s setting her MetaMask wallet. That’s what interests us.”  Zhang wasn’t too invested in crypto before encountering FWB. He’d bought a little bitcoin and ether on the advice of friends, but it was the advent of DAOs that really piqued his curiosity.  In decentralized autonomous organizations, every member is also a stakeholder. It’s a way of organizing economic activity around tokens rather than shares. Each member holds a certain number of tokens (in this case $FWB), which work like voting stock in a corporation.  Get the whole of Crypto 2022: Culture Week.  Proposals for how to run the DAO (what to do with the group treasury, how stringent to be about membership guidelines, and so on) are put to a vote. DAOs are also typically unincorporated, so it seems possible that entities issuing these stock-like tokens might attract regulators’ attention in the near future.  And while many DAOs are essentially just token-gated Discord servers, others have built software, mobilized millions of dollars for fundraisers and launched crypto-powered residency programs for artists and developers.  DAOs package financial commitments with online sociality. The idea is that the more good work you produce and the more sophisticated a community you cultivate, the more outsiders want in, and the more your token prices rise. $FWB didn’t start at $77 per token. It got there through a combination of reputation building, savvy marketing and returns for investors. The $10 million from Andreessen Horowitz probably didn’t hurt, either.  It’s been a huge win for FWB’s early entrants (mostly just friends of McFedries and a handful of curious crypto investors), but it’s made the tokens prohibitively expensive for precisely the kinds of people the group is looking to attract. Limiting FWB applicants to risk-tolerant speculators – those traders willing to invest in the 75 tokens – inevitably homogenizes the vibe.  It’s become “a victim of its own success” in that respect, according to one writer and early FWB member who wished to remain anonymous.  There’s now an official Friends With Benefits fellowship program geared toward inducting new members from underrepresented communities. If you’re accepted, you’ll get a chance to earn a grant of 75 tokens.  Said Zhang: “We’ve set aside 18,000 tokens in perpetuity, every season [FWB rolls out new programming over time, in phases called “seasons”] admitting roughly 20 to 30 artists – different folks, who are underrepresented – to join and participate in the community. They get to learn about the power of owning tokens, owning equities, owning the upside of the value that they create.”  Financiers with benefits  The group is constantly wrestling with that financial component. There are channels in the FWB Discord server dedicated entirely to “alpha,” finance slang for early access to information about good investments. Buzz about new startups and upcoming NFT projects often circulates here before it reaches the rest of the industry, which means FWB members can get the jump on news before it drops.  When the designer Eric Hu launched a series of artworks-as-NFTs earlier this year, he gave early access to FWB members as a “thank you” to the community. (Hu is a longtime member and active contributor.) In crypto, this sort of access and timing can lead to direct financial gain.  “You’re part of a community and you feel like everyone’s getting wealthy together. It feels good, in a way,” said another member, an artist, who declined to use his name for this story.  You can see this reflected in the logic of “WAGMI,” a common mantra in the crypto space – “we’re all gonna make it.”  Dexter Tortoriello, another FWB co-founder, said that while channels with names like “trading-stonks” have always been core to the group dynamic, they’ve never completely defined it.  “It’s not like the GameStop Reddit crew by any means in the stocks channel,” he explained, referencing the wave of “tendies”-consuming, Elon Musk-worshipping, diamond-handed traders who pumped the price of GameStop stock in late January.  As it has grown, Friends With Benefits has also become an incubator for new crypto projects. David Greenstein, a longtime FWB member, co-founded a company with a musician and coder he met in the Discord server earlier this year; yesterday, their company announced a $5 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz.  Greenstein said that part of what excited him about the space was its connections outside of crypto, specifically in the music world. Trevor McFedries kick-started his career as an early employee at Spotify; Alex Zhang was a band manager and show promoter; and Dexter Tortoriello makes music under the name Houses.  “Seeing David staff up his company and really workshop ideas inside of FWB is exciting,” said Tortoriello. “The fact that that can happen, and he can take very talented people and give them a seat at the table with potentially what could be the next SoundCloud or Spotify – that’s really cool.”  As always with Web 3, the financial is bound up in the cultural. Despite the price of admission, the technical barriers to entry and the lack of diversity baked into crypto, FWB has managed to build something that’s genuinely opposed to the broader identity of Web 3. There’s a reason the group encourages its members to use their real names as opposed to their online pseudonyms.  FWB is still subject to the whims of the market – the token could tank tomorrow, leaving new investors holding the bag – but the idea is to attract members who are after more than just money. Friends With Benefits isn’t about socializing just to get paid, it’s about socializing and getting paid.  “From a community standpoint,” said Tortoriello, “there’s kind of nothing better than that.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2021/12/16/whats-next-for-friends-with-benefits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35da6527d5082e7a8b3b0b4b86b7b14092d9ab0a-2928x1876.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424078,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2k1rh,1639687161,Kazakhstan Piloting a CBDC on R3′s Corda Platform,"The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) is using R3′s Corda platform for the ongoing pilot of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital tenge, the bank said in a report published Wednesday.  NBK highlighted Corda’s capacity to maintain “anonymity, confidentiality and traceability of transactions,” and open-source code. Sweden, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, South Africa, France and the European Union have also started successful CBDC projects based on Corda,” the report said.  The 99-page document examined the CBDC pilot, which launched in May and involves two of the country’s larger commercial banks, Kaspi Bank JSC and Eurasian Bank JSC. The report, the second produced this year on a possible tenge, considered CBDC use cases and potential monetary and financial impacts, among other issues.  In the two-tier CBDC model that NBK is exploring, the central bank supervises the whole system and smaller banks open digital tenge wallets for users to “exchange, redeem, restore the D[igital] T[enge] and make interbank transfers,” the report said.  Similar to cash, the digital tenge tokens will not be recorded on banks’ balance sheets, only in users’ digital wallets, ensuring that tenge transactions are different from bank wire payments.  The token can be programmed so that only authorized public institutions can distribute funds and individuals will have limited ways to spend them, the report said. For example, public funds can be specifically allocated for medical programs.  The report struck an optimistic tone that a digital tenge could foster more financial inclusion. More than one in five people in Kazakhstan do not have access to banking and this trend is particularly pronounced in rural areas, where a large number of individuals continue to use cash for retail transactions. Cashless payments make up roughly 77% of all transactions, the report noted.  The document also suggested that a CBDC should be available offline to ensure that people without internet access can also use such a currency, although it saidthe technological solutions preventing double-spending in such cases have yet to be developed.  The report noted that CBDC projects worldwide are in development stages. While “most central banks have already joined the race, however, there is no mature and well-established practice yet - this is still an area for research and experimentation,” the report said.  NBK is planning to complete more trials and studies until July 2022 before deciding whether to launch the digital tenge in December.

42411617,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4kz,1639686721,The Future of NFTs Is Fungible,"“Wen token?”  It’s the refrain heard in Discord servers around the world. When is such-and-such project going to airdrop a token to its community members? This question is particularly urgent if a community happens to assemble around a $2 billion NFT project – one like Bored Ape Yacht Club. That’s why BAYC had an answer to the question in October:  As the Bored Ape holders have discovered, it’s super cool to launch a non-fungible token collection and see a community develop around it. But at some point it gets difficult to herd all the cats – especially if said cats are also very rich people. What if there were some way to coordinate them and align their interests? What if you could do all of this on-chain? With a cryptographic token perhaps?  This article is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment.  This is why the future of NFTs is fungible. The many NFT communities that have sprung up this year are finding that it’s not so easy to manage a community with unique tokens alone. Fungible tokens created by the community start to become very attractive in theory. Luckily for them, this concept already exists: it’s the world of social tokens – streams of community-centric tokens that are, yes, fungible.  The non-fungible argument  Social tokens have been ably covered in the pages of this fine website for some time. Here’s a great Jeff Wilser feature that dives deep into the genre. But here’s a quick summary of how they’re supposed to work: Suppose you spot a promising young artist from among the selection presented to you by Spotify’s algorithm. You stream their music thousands of times over the years, gradually attending concerts and buying merch. Eventually, the artist breaks through to the mainstream and is picking up Grammys left and right, and appearing on “Saturday Night Live.”  The above example might be called the “Taylor Swift Hypothesis” of social tokens. The way the hypothesis works is, imagine injecting a token into the scenario above. What if that artist is Taylor Swift, and what if she has issued $SWIFT in the earliest days of your fandom. You might have accumulated lots of $SWIFT, watching the stash grow in fiat money terms as Taylor ascended the heights of pop stardom. The Swift Hypothesis is described in the Index Ventures investor Rex Woodbury’s recent think piece on social tokens in The Atlantic.  But let’s look at why some NFT believers think fungible tokens for communities don’t work. Here’s GMoney, the cutesy, pixelated, half-man, half-monkey NFT collector making his argument: A stash of tokens is first held by a creator who distributes the tokens to fans. As the creator creates more valuable work, those tokens rise in price. But to realize those gains, the creator must continuously sell the tokens to fans. This leaves creators with a diminishing horde of tokens, thus disincentivizing them to increase the value of their work.  “Your incentives are misaligned,” GMoney says.  That’s the catch: Taylor would have been dumping $SWIFT on her fans all the way to the top. Her most loyal fans would have been her exit liquidity, to adopt the parlance of Crypto Twitter. The Swift Hypothesis would become the Swift Pump and Dump if that was the only way social tokens worked.  And GMoney isn’t alone among the cryptorati casting doubt on social tokens. Here’s Simon de la Rouviere, one of the authors of the ERC-721 standard, positing that NFTs are, in fact, better social tokens!  The social tokens rebuttal  This is as good a place as any to mention that I have a vested interest in social tokens working. I’m an adviser at Rally, which helps esports streamers, musicians and creators of all stripes issue their own tokens to fans. I’m also a contributor and investor in Seed Club, an accelerator for social token projects.  As we know in crypto, misaligned incentives is one of the most damning charges that can be leveled at a project. So I turned to Jess Sloss, the person who started Seed Club and who stays at the cutting edge of social tokens, for a robust rebuttal to GMoney’s monkey business.  “Social tokens are better equity,” Sloss tells me. Dear reader, before you start dialing the Securities and Exchange Commission hotline for unregistered securities offerings, this is what he really meant by that: Fungible tokens for a community are more expressive than NFTs. While NFTs might be good at capital raising and formation, they are less good at keeping a community going. This is where social tokens come in.  “What many of these communities haven’t thought through is how to sustain [them] into the future?” Sloss says. “Ultimately, we need to be able to reward more nuanced collaboration and represent that in the governance stack.”  For instance, a community might need to pay core members for development or editorial work. It might need to raise new funding without diluting existing creative work. It might also need a way to vote on stuff.  Here’s how Sloss frames it, using the startup as a metaphor: “If a creator has a community of fans looking to create something bigger and more broad than the work of that creator, then a fungible token makes a lot of sense.  See also: Missed the ENS Airdrop? | Opinion  “Essentially, you have a bank account and a cap table. The fungible token represents that cap table that you can use to pay people, sell for investment [and] reward people for the work they do in that community. All those things are very hard to do with an NFT unless you’re minting new NFTs and giving them away, or you’re holding bags of NFTs ... You’re going to get stuck at some point.”  Bored Apes could be a glimpse into the future of an NFT community that gets coordinated around a new, fungible, token. SquiggleDAO, which Sloss works on, is another example: a collector DAO for generative art and Chromie Squiggles in particular, its $SQUIG token lets holders vote on how they use the DAO’s resources, which includes $8 million in USDC it raised from selling $SQUIG to big investors.  The fun in fungible  What else can you do with a social token? Sloss corrects me: The term of art now is community tokens or community DAOs. He says he’s seeing a surge of interest in founders of Web 2 companies exploring how to disperse ownership of their firms to communities using a DAO as he sifts through applications for Seed Club’s fourth cohort (the third cohort had Pussy Riot and other notables). “They’re recognizing they’re building on a tech stack that will be quickly outdated and will have a tough time competing with a Web 3 version of their product,” he said. “There’s an explosion of DAOs being created right now.”  The hottest use cases, Sloss says, are DAOs that aid learning, particularly learning about Web 3. He name DAO Masters, Web3 baddies (“welcome to the hot girl metaverse”) and the Crypto, Culture and Society DAO as prime examples. He’s also bullish on a token from the industry newsletter Water and Music that incentivizes research on music and technology among its subscribers.  “I think longevity is going to come into the operations,” Sloss says. “It’s like, let’s go out and buy the Constitution … then what? The ‘then what’ is the exciting part.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TRADING | AIRDROP,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/culture-week/2021/12/16/the-future-of-nfts-is-fungible,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afaaa0c16441a5d142006b89ef473500eaa99ec2-2048x1360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393994,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQdeh,1639682859,Behind the Scenes of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Bond With the Man Who Designed It,"El Salvador’s national adoption of bitcoin was easily the most transformational cryptocurrency landmark in a year full of them. The use of bitcoin as legal tender seems poised to attract a wave of experiments and investment, while a program to mine bitcoin using volcanic energy could be a significant boost for the lower-income economy.  But El Salvador’s recently-announced “Bitcoin Bond” may be the most truly disruptive and empowering part of the project. By selling bitcoin-backed bonds through blockchain infrastructure, El Salvador will bypass the Wall Street banks and international institutions that have had a century-long choke hold on loans to developing economies. There are signs that this could escalate into a full-scale public battle as global financiers angle to retain control of the system.  Still, there are plenty of questions about the functional details of the bond, and a lot of unknowns about its real impact. To find out more, I recently spoke with Samson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer of Blockstream. Mow and Blockstream acted as advisors on the design of the bond, and the bond will be issued using Liquid, a bitcoin-based service created by Blockstream. But Blockstream won’t be directly involved in issuing, selling or servicing the bond, which will be handled by El Salvador’s central bank and the Bitfinex crypto exchange.  Read more: David Morris’s profile of Jack Mallers for “Most Influential 2021″  Mow got involved with El Salvador through Strike CEO Jack Mallers, recognized recently by CoinDesk as one of the most influential people in cryptocurrency for helping spearhead El Salvador’s program.  “Our relationship goes back to the blocksize wars,” Mow said. “He came in on the small block side … That was a formative period in bitcoin history, when a lot of alliances were made. A lot of those alliances are still in place today.”  Mow says he first pitched the bond idea, via Mallers, ahead of the Bitcoin 2021 conference in June. But with the Salvadoran government focused on the retail rollout, real work on the bond didn’t get underway until October. Despite the project’s accelerated timeline, Mow was able to spend a good amount of time in El Salvador, and took away a positive impression of the Salvadoran government and its officials.  “The overarching feeling was one of very strong cohesion and direction,” he said. “I’ve been on trade missions before, with the government of Canada, but I’ve never felt this kind of drive from government officials … I felt, this is a once in a lifetime, a once in a thousand years chance to do something.”  That sense of shared purpose and commitment extended to Mow’s interactions with a variety of government agencies – not just finance teams, but also those focused on tourism, agriculture and energy.  “They were arranging things on the weekends, they were all scrambling to make something happen,” said Mow. “I met with the guys at [state power companies] Cel and LaGeo – those guys are on all the time. Everyone is really rallying behind [President Nayib] Bukele, and everyone believes in his ability to lead. That’s why they’re able to do things so quickly.”  Mow contrasts that focus with Canada, where he said, “We’re sitting on massive hydropower, but we’re not doing anything with it.” (Blockstream is based in Victoria, British Columbia.) Mow’s takeaway is particularly interesting in light of attempts to paint Bukele as a nascent dictator, which are hard to square with the sky-high public approval ratings he’s maintained since winning power in a 2019 election that the U.S. State Departmenthttps://sv.usembassy.gov/2019-presidential-elections-transparent-credible/ called “transparent and credible.”  Ultimately Mow said he developed three possible designs for the bond. One proposal was closer to the mining-backed notes issued by Blockstream. Another proposal on the table was a more traditional bond issued in the form of a crypto token. The decision was ultimately made to go with the initial proposal, which tied bond returns strongly to bitcoin’s price performance over the next 10 years.  Amazingly, Mow said there was little discussion of whether the bonds would sell. “The target market for at least the first few bonds is people familiar with the Bitcoin space. I don’t think marketability was ever an issue, because there’s so much capital in the space. We never really thought it would be an issue to fill one bond, if not five bonds.”  As of our conversation in early December, Mow said there were already $300 million worth of “soft commitments” to the bond, which is still being refined ahead of its expected launch in 2022. “These are just Bitfinex whales, mostly,” said Mow.  That demand is great news for El Salvador, though it does highlight one of the potential risks of the project. Bitfinex is very closely aligned with tether, a dollar-denominated stablecoin that has been caught misrepresenting its reserves and accused of printing unbacked tokens. El Salvador will have to be vigilant to ensure it trades its assets for the real U.S. dollars or bitcoin it needs to run its economy, not questionable synthetic USD.  For regulators and authorities outside of El Salvador, the role of Bitfinex is worrying for other reasons. The exchange does not have a history of strong anti-money laundering (AML) or other financial controls, and operates with scattershot regulatory oversight. El Salvador is a sovereign nation, and has the right to sell its bonds to anyone who’s interested, in theory leaving a very large lane for money laundering or other abuses.  Ironically, Bitfinex officially doesn’t serve U.S. customers, meaning they’re among the most likely to be effectively barred from the bond sale. “It will be up to U.S. broker-dealers to see if they can source it,” said Mow.  “I think the bonds are probably the next biggest thing since Bitcoin’s invention,” Mow said of the larger stakes. “It’s a way for a huge flood of capital to flow into this bitcoin-based financial system. And the challenge has been, who will do it. Most people are followers, and nation-states are the same. They need to see someone do it, and they need to see it succeed, and then they’ll do it.”  As for the mounting hostility of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other legacy players, Mow sees them sweating.  “I think it’s definitely a threat. They’re feeling it. But I don’t think it matters in the long run,” he said. “These organizations do harm people, and they do make nation-states into vassal states. There’s a high degree of interference with sovereign nations who are not so sovereign. That’s going to be hard for organizations like the IMF to swallow, but I just don’t think there’s anything they can do about it.”  Blockstream is happy to help push that challenge along. Mow says that the design of the bond, like Blockstream’s software, will be open-sourced. “All of the things we’re designing for the bonds, specifications, the economics, the legal framework, people are welcome to adopt this.”  Mow predicts a dramatic domino effect as countries follow El Salvador’s lead and decouple from the U.S. dollar system.  “We’re at a stage where Bitcoin is pretty secure and pretty resilient against any attack. We saw that with China shutting down mining. The mining will move, it’ll adjust. But [the Bitcoin Bond] is another level of going up against massive institutions. Your SDR [Special Drawing Rights, foreign exchange reserves housed at the IMF] aren’t going to work anymore if fiat doesn’t work anymore.  “You either get with the program or you become obsolete.

This could prove to be a bearish signal for the crypto. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Taking Significant Losses As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC market is now looking at significant losses being realized. This trend may be reminiscent of the May 2021 crash. The relevant indicator here is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which is an on-chain metric. The SOPR measures the profit ratio of the overall market to check whether investors are, on an average, in profit or loss. The indicator works by looking at the price each coin on the chain was bought at and comparing it with the selling price. When the value of the SOPR is above 1, it means coins during the period sold at a profit. On the other hand, values below 1 suggest holders were selling at a loss. Also, naturally, when the indicator&apos;s value is exactly equal to one, the investors were, on average, breaking even for the specific timescale. A modified version of the metric is the Short-Term Holder SOPR (STH-SOPR), which shows the SOPR for coins that were held for less than 155 days.

42390142,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUthwf,1639680420,Why I Spent $29M on a Beeple,"Before this year, crypto was a cult. In 2021, crypto became culture.  The movement was both catalyzed and led by the standard-bearer of digital art, Mike Winkelmann, known to the world as Beeple. No one in crypto had predicted that art would be what would bring crypto into the mainstream before this year, but here we are, and I am very grateful for the new energy and new entrants into our community.  Human One, Beeple’s masterpiece digital sculpture, capped the year as perhaps the most important non-fungible token (NFT) ever minted and, according to Jehan Chu, the leading voice in the crossover between crypto and fine art, “the most important piece of art in this century, so far.”  Ryan Zurrer is founder and managing director at Dialectic AG, a bespoke invite-only crypto-wealth multi-family office. This post is part of CoinDesk’s Culture Week.  The first native of the metaverse, Human One is an important meditation on mankind’s first steps into this new virtual realm and invites deep questions about our relationship between our digital identities in relation to our real-world selves. The introspective conversation that Human One invokes is timely and poignant in our society as each individual must wrestle with this new sense of self and find a balance between these worlds we now occupy simultaneously.  During the NFT.NYC conference in New York, Human One was a pilgrimage, attracting thousands to see it. The lines outside the Christie’s showroom give us a data point of just how much Human One resonates and inspires people from all walks of life.  The physical renditions of digital art that Beeple thoughtfully builds with 3D printers, laser cutters and robotics at his futuristic campus in Charleston, South Carolina, also add a new layer to the design space between the metaverse and our physical reality. I was lucky enough to travel to Beeple’s sprawling campus where Mike (Beeple), his brother Scott and a selection of artists and aerospace engineers are innovating at a wild pace. It literally felt like taking a trip through some crazy mix of Andy Warhol’s studio and Bell Labs in their respective primes.  A living, evolving artwork  When an artist signs their work, it signifies that it is completed. While Beeple’s team has signed Human One, Mike and Scott still haven’t, signifying that their work is not yet completed. I think the world didn’t really understand that Beeple will update Human One regularly and for the rest of his career. This fundamentally changes the relationship between artist and collector, another first in the history of art. By the end of Beeple’s career, Human One will actually be many thousands of his works.  Further, we already see that Beeple is a true master of his craft, constantly evolving, innovating and improving. I made a bet here that Beeple’s future pieces will be even better than his previous work.  For the laughs  Beeple captures pop culture with the deft lens of Warhol, has the wide-sweeping range of skills of Jeff Koons and the irreverent scale of ambition of Damien Hirst, all in one. But even more amazing, he is a wonderful, humble and hilarious human being. A huge part of the value for me is that I get to have a 30+ year journey with my good friend. This investment will pay for itself in belly laughs many times over.  Metcalfe’s Law applied to NFTs  I’m frequently asked why NFTs garner such significant premiums compared to their comparable physical contemporaries. This phenomenon draws some rationale from Metcalfe’s Law, the law that a network’s value is the square of the connections in said network, but loosely applied to art.  Because there is a massive and very well-capitalized audience that can bid for any piece at any time, we have purer price discovery, which has driven prices higher. An example: If you held a special Picasso in your home, the chances that someone would walk by the artwork who has both the means and desire to make you a compelling offer is incredibly low.  Read more: Most Influential 2021: Beeple  Even if you take it to auction, there is a minuscule fraction of your potential market that will actually have awareness of the piece. With NFTs, anyone globally can deeply analyze any piece and make any offer at any time to you for your works. A result of this market dynamic is that online marketplaces such as SuperRare are significantly outperforming Sotheby’s and Christie’s this year as many artists have A/B tested how best to sell their works. Expect this difference to become more pronounced moving forward.  What to expect in 2022  I predict a series of events to take place over the next 18 months and offer a roadmap on how I intend to navigate these uncharted waters:  First, we’ll see a broadening of the use cases of NFTs. Expect music NFTs to enter the spotlight. However, intellectual property, full feature films, spatial NFTs using augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) and many other forms of media and digital assets will emerge as NFTs. This is wonderful because one of my favorite outcomes of the NFT movement is how it has created a meaningful new wealth distribution in crypto. Another new cohort of creators will now have a path to financial and creative independence. Overall, the market will expand quite substantially beyond today’s primary categories of gaming, collectibles and fine art that caught fire in 2021.  However, we will also be forced into specialization. In our own collecting at my family office Dialectic, the gaming decisions are made by different professionals than the art decisions and so on. I suspect specialization will proliferate.  Second, at some point, we will inevitably have a washout and migration towards quality. Like initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017 and essentially all emerging industries before, 90% or more of the assets and projects that went parabolic in the hype-cycle upswing will prove nearly worthless over time. However, let’s remember that the roughly 10% that does survive goes on to be incredibly valuable and important.  In order to navigate this reckoning, my own North Star is defined by a concept I call “Proof of Art Work.” If we draw on a crypto example, one could argue that the very baseline minimum value of a proof-of-work crypto network, such as Bitcoin, is the sum of the capital expenditures and operational expenditures, i.e. the “work” that it took to bring the codebase and ledger to the present moment. At Dialectic, we look at artwork the same way, and we ask ourselves how much time, effort, collaboration, innovation, artistic merit and training went into the piece at hand. I ask myself, is it rare? Is it culturally important? Is it innovative either technically or in the story it tells and the emotions it evokes?  This selection protocol causes me to miss some of the cheekier pieces that may capture memetic tailwinds, but I am left with high-quality innovative digital art that I can quietly enjoy irrespective of market movements. That is why I lean into a historic piece such as Human One.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Ryan Zurrer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/16/why-i-spent-29m-on-a-beeple,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b107fc0240595eaa3d87d82756330e508dc77687-1584x928.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The NFTs – digital tokens representing “vision and concept statements” and potential Web 3 policy agenda items linked to addresses on the Solana blockchain – are intended to bring the crypto industry into Kurani’s campaign to win a seat on the U.S. House of Representatives.  “There’s a lot of misunderstanding in terms of what crypto is, what crypto can be, the direction that it’s going in, who it serves,” Kurani told CoinDesk. “And I think there’s a way for us to be able to build more of a bridge between policymakers and folks in the space to be able to actually have more of a conversation, and that, I think, brings me to my second goal, which is actually engaging the crypto community to be able to participate in the future of crypto legislation.”  The NFTs would be part of a broader push, Kurani said, saying her campaign could also use tools like Discord to engage a community.  Kurani, whose LinkedIn profile says she’s currently the vice president of business at investment startup Republic, said she picked Solana to address environmental concerns, noting its delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Kurani has a degree in sustainability science, and is making climate issues a part of her campaign.  To that end, the would-be lawmaker sees education around blockchain and cryptocurrencies as a key issue in the sustainability conversation.  “When you’re talking about the future of technology, there’s always going to be a footprint, right? Using Google, [using] email, using any form of technology, plugging into a wall outlet uses energy, right? And it depends on where the energy is being sourced from how efficient those processes are,” she said.  The trade-off – the potential for a more inclusive financial system – is worth it, in Kurani’s eyes.  Regulatory gaps  If Kurani is elected, she sees tax and accounting rules as two areas that can easily be addressed with new legislation.  “I think clarity is something that helps everyone across the board, to help regulators and to help the participants,” she said. “I think there’s sort of baseline low-hanging fruit that we can help everyone in the space be able to participate in a compliant way that doesn’t add an onerous amount of regulatory overhead that we might be seeing.”  She also does not see cryptocurrency regulation as being a partisan issue. The issue will “affect everyone,” and it will require lawmakers from both major political parties to address.  “We’re thinking about the next generation of the internet as participatory and inclusive, where this type of unit user ownership can actually promote financial inclusion, where we can have enhanced transparency across the board,” Kurani said.  Thursday’s slate of NFTs are a salvo in that debate in bringing new audiences to the campaign, she said.  “I think the main goal is to really educate the American population on blockchain and to continue building that bridge between crypto and politics, to engage the community, and yes, help us get to Congress and we can actually have more [crypto]-literate candidates,” she said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/16/congressional-candidate-kurani-dropping-2022-solana-nfts-as-part-of-campaign,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93ca2fbc352b59e47f9c1a83c77bf7e3d956fac7-1840x1228.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Earlier this month, Square announced changing its name to Block to reflect changes to its business. The step may also be signaling the firm’s significant crypto ambitions.  On Thursday, H&R Block said it has filed a lawsuit against the Jack Dorsey-run Block, arguing that “the goodwill and brand identity that [H&R] Block has carefully cultivated and nurtured over the last 65 years is under attack by the Silicon Valley fintech company.”  H&R Block noted this new Block is a competitor in several financial services areas, including tax preparation via Block’s recent purchase of Credit Karma Tax, now called Cash App Taxes.  “Today’s filing is an important effort to prevent consumer confusion and ensure a competitor cannot leverage the reputation and trust we have built over more than six decades,” said H&R Block CEO Jeff Jones.  The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  Shares of Block were down 5.3% to $164.91 in trading Thursday.

ConsenSys also said systems built using Rollups can reach a throughput of up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) on a private chain, compared to only 300 TPS on private chains without Rollups and 15 TPS on the Ethereum mainnet.  ConsenSys Rollups also offers “strong privacy protections to both enhance solutions for existing use cases and enable new use cases,” Madeline Murray, global lead of protocol engineering at ConsenSys, said in the statement.  Those use cases could include central bank digital currencies (CBDC), decentralized exchanges (DEX), micropayments and private transfer and taxes, ConsenSys said.  ConsenSys developed the extremely popular crypto wallet MetaMask and manages a handful of developer toolkits, including blockchain application programming interface (API) suite Infura and Truffle, for smart contract development. The company has been expanding after recent fundraising efforts that valued the firm at about $3.2 billion.

France’s central bank has been exploring the use of a CBDC for the exchange of money between financial institutions since March 2020.  The final stage of the first tranche of experiments consisted of the issuance of a digital bond on a blockchain with settlement in CBDC, which was conducted with numerous partners, including banking giant HSBC.  “The experiment successfully tested an end-to-end transactional lifecycle of digital assets,” Banque de France said Thursday. “All transactions occurred across different blockchain environments operated by HSBC for the custody of the assets, and by the Banque de France for the securities settlement and the CBDC.”  Central banks across the world are exploring the development of digital currencies, in part to address the decline in the use of cash just as interest in private cryptocurrencies is gathering steam. Exploration of wholesale CBDCs is, however, confined to a smaller group attempting to use a CBDC to address some of the inefficiencies and complications of exchanging central bank money between financial institutions.  A wholesale CBDC is a digital currency issued for use by financial institutions to exchange central bank-issued money. It is different from a retail CBDC, which is intended for use by the public as a form of digital cash.  The Banque de France is also exploring a retail CBDC as part of the European Central Bank’s broader work on the potential development of a digital euro.

42420829,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlFF,1639668421,"After $130M Hack, Badger’s Restitution Plan Tests Limits of DAO Governance","After a devastating $130 million hack, BadgerDAO is moving forward with the first steps in an ambitious restitution plan that may be among the most complex in decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) history.  In early December, a front-end exploit drained the DeFi yield vault platform of $130 million in various assets – upwards of 10% of its total value locked (TVL) at the time of the attack. Now the DAO – in this case, an ostensibly leaderless collective governing a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol – is grappling with how and if to make users whole.  While restitution plans are a common occurrence in DeFi – an emerging and dangerous $250 billion sector where exploits themselves happen all too frequently – BadgerDAO’s effort to compensate victims may be the largest of its kind yet.  Read more: BadgerDAO Reveals Details of How It Was Hacked for $120M  According to BadgerDAO founder Chris Spadafora, the undertaking depends on the contributions of Badger’s 32,000 users and 25 core contributors, many of whom have differing ideas about how to best handle a situation where losses well exceed the DAO’s current treasury of roughly $53 million.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Spadafora said tthe DAO has broken the lost assets into three “tranches,” each of which will require a separate governance process in order to make users whole.  Across a half dozen Badger Improvement Proposals (BIP), numerous blog posts and ongoing discussions in community forums, an outline of the protocol’s payback plan for each of the tranches is beginning to form.  The effort also comes amid a period of greater scrutiny for DAO processes. DAOs as a model have come under criticism in recent weeks as DeFi platform Sushi has been hobbled by internal squabbling, and an ad-hoc DAO formed to buy a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution failed, in part, because their highest possible bid was public knowledge ahead of the auction.  Spadafora, however, believes Badger can rise to the challenge.  “This is one of the more precedent-setting and monumental, large-scale DAO decisions – or multitude of decisions – that the space has ever seen,” he said.  Governance assets  The first tranche of lost assets to address is also the simplest from a governance perspective: the 192,000 BADGER tokens stolen in the attack, currently worth $2.8 million.  Restoring this asset is especially important for the governance process, as this token grants holders the right to vote in major BadgerDAO decisions.  “What the community seems to think is that those that were affected should have their governance rights reinstituted by distributing BADGER from the treasury to allow them to participate in governance related to their restitution, and moving forward with the protocol,” said Spadafora.  The protocol’s treasury currently has 7.5 million BADGER not earmarked for other uses and can distribute the tokens with a simple vote. BIP-79, a proposal to do exactly that, is currently on its way to reaching quorum in Badger governance forums and will be headed to an on-chain vote for approval in the coming days.  Per Spadafora, restoring the governance tranche would lead to 17% of all affected users getting 100% of their assets back from the exploit, though BADGER has fallen over 50% in value to $14.68 per token since the attack.  Badger claws back  The second tranche represents what Spadafora refers to as “reclaimable” assets.  BIP-33 introduced an emergency function that would allow for the ability for various wallets to pause the protocol’s smart contracts to mitigate the damage of an exploit, which is exactly what occurred on the night of Dec. 1.  “The contract pause prevented 50% more users that had already approved that malicious actor from spending their funds, and what it also did, it prevented any other vault tokens in the exploiter’s address from being withdrawn,” said Spadafora.  Now, the DAO wants to upgrade Badger’s smart contracts to enable “rugging the funds back,” said Spadafora.  The exploiter’s address currently has $9.2 million in vault tokens that could be seized in a “one-time function” contract upgrade. This would enable an additional 38% of affected users to get a token-for-token refund on losses.  However, for security purposes, this requires multiple governance proposals: BIP-76, which upgrades the contract to enable the seizure of stolen assets; BIP-77, which will restart the contracts and seize the funds; and BIP-78, which will return the funds.  All three are currently up for voting and appear as if they will pass with an overwhelming majority.  Major losses  While distributing governance tokens and reclaiming vault tokens will compensate over half the affected users in the hack, the largest tranche the DAO will have to address is the most complicated, accounting for $121 million.  Because of the nature of the exploit, the attacker started with the largest affected users and worked his way down the list, meaning 10 victims make up the majority of the loss. This presents an unusual conundrum for the majority of Badger’s users.  “How do those 32,000 Badger holders feel about the disparity, the effect of the exploit on the protocol as a whole, versus a very small amount of specific victims. It’s not like 10,000 people lost $10,000 each, and that changes the dynamic quite substantially,” said Spadafora.  Read more: Crypto Lender Celsius Admits Losses in $120M BadgerDAO Hack  The supermajority didn’t lose, but hypothetically they want to act in a way that benefits them, which means restoring confidence in the protocol for the long term with full restitution.  The treasury, however, cannot afford full restitution immediately, leading to a number of thorny questions.  “There are fundamental decisions here: Should there be restitution, step one. Step two, should it be immediate or over time? If immediate, what percentage? And if it’s over time, via what mechanic? Governance tokens, maybe a vault-type product that pays back over time versus interest generated … there’s a lot of options,” said Spadafora.  Badger’s various yield vault products produce income that could be included in a compensation plan, and the overall platform has brought in $24,511,918 in revenues since launching in December 2020, per a Dune Analytics dashboard.  So far, Spadafora says that the community is attempting to take a balanced approach that will include immediate compensation as well as a payback mechanism of some sort via the vaults, with weighted immediate payouts versus long-term options.  “It might not have a defined timeframe or a complete commitment to full restitution, but the community is putting together a very clear mechanic for how restitution is happening and how it’s tracked – that’s what I’ve seen bubble up,” Spadafora added.  Precedents and monuments  The scale of what the DAO is attempting isn’t lost on Spadafora, who notes that marshaling the community’s resources and reaching consensus hasn’t always been a smooth process.  However, he hopes the ongoing restitution debates – held just two weeks after the initial exploit – will be seen as a model for what open organizations can accomplish.  “You’re talking about people who have never met, from around the world, going through such a dramatic thing as a collective, then mustering up the strength to respond in such a high integrity way,” he said. “It’s very amazing to see.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/16/after-130m-hack-badgers-restitution-plan-tests-limits-of-dao-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bf8d17caa8cf0962a36b1511b8ddcebbb337a6e-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411606,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4Nq,1639666800,It Can’t Be ‘Decentralization or Bust’,"The Bitcoin white paper doesn’t mention the word decentralization once – but it’s obviously there by another name: peer-to-peer. The Ethereum white paper mentions decentralization about 40 times. And when the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) released its report on stablecoins last month, 15% of it was dedicated to the concept of decentralization and how to appropriately manage it when most of financial services remain heavily centralized (and analog).  Decentralization is one of the more hard-to-define words in an industry filled with confusing neologisms. It seems to describe a simple concept: activity that isn’t organized by a central authority. But defining it, and why it matters, and how to regulate it, isn’t so simple. Getting these answers right will have significant implications for the future of the digital asset economy.  Jared A. Favole is a senior director of communications and policy at Circle, the principal operator of USD Coin (USDC).  As a starting point, policymakers should get comfortable with the idea that some projects will be fully (or close to it) decentralized. The industry needs to avoid advocating only for projects that are 100% decentralized – that brings to mind for some, particularly regulators, the idea of runaway code. And the last thing anyone wants with their money is for it to run away.  Decentralization and centralization operate on a spectrum: There’s decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) on one side and centralized entities on the other side (Coinbase, for example) that benefit from decentralized technology. Both forms of organizing can, will and must coexist for us to realize the full potential of blockchain and crypto technologies.  Decentralization – or the degree of decentralization – has important technical, marketing and legal implications.  Decentralization is great. The continued existence of Bitcoin, even in the face of crypto bans by nation states, speaks volumes about the power of decentralization (and public-key cryptography). It’s something to marvel at and cumulatively it has given rise to a now $2+ trillion asset class.  But Bitcoin, and decentralization, have drawbacks. For example, making changes in decentralized systems is often difficult and slow.  From a marketing perspective, decentralization can help attract developers who scoff at the idea of using their talents to help another centralized entity amass power. That power-to-the-people approach runs deep in crypto, which isn’t surprising because many in the industry had to suffer through the consequences of the Great Recession, infamously with the downfall of large, centralized financial institutions.  The legal importance of decentralization became clear a few years ago, when securities regulators suggested bitcoin and ether aren’t subject to securities regulation partly because the networks they run on are sufficiently decentralized.  Projects have since strained to demonstrate their decentralization by setting up foundations or separate legal entities. The thinking of some founders goes something like this: If our project is sufficiently decentralized then the activity isn’t subject to securities regulation. Perfect!  But the government isn’t fooled. The PWG report stated:  “In some cases, despite claims of decentralization, operations and activities within DeFi are highly concentrated in and, governed or administered by, a small group of developers and/or investors. Despite some asserted distinctions from more traditional or centralized financial products, services and activities, DeFi arrangements often offer the same or similar products, services and activities, and raise similar investor and consumer protection, market integrity and policy concerns.”  If projects are dishonest about their level of decentralization, that casts a shadow on the projects that truly are decentralized. It’s worth noting, too, that centralization has benefits. When people assemble in a centralized way, be it at a company or a sports team, they can do great things, while also producing single points of failure, cabals or monopolies.  Both/and instead of either/or  The future success of blockchain and crypto technologies doesn’t need to rely upon 100% decentralization. In fact, the industry is so successful today because it is built on the back of decentralized technologies AND centralized organizations. Much like the debate about artificial intelligence, which often pits man vs. machine instead of acknowledging the real power comes when man AND machine work together, meaningful innovation in crypto often comes when centralized entities work with decentralization.  For example, venture capital firms like a16z and Digital Currency Group, crypto companies like Coinbase and FTX, and media companies like The Wall Street Journal and this publication, have all played an important role in popularizing decentralized technologies.  Missing from the list of centralized entities that can help or harm the industry are governments. Governments are the missing link to help blockchain and crypto technologies continue to grow.  For one, there are many people who won’t touch crypto because for them it lacks the imprimatur of the government; the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) continued rejection of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds reinforces this. The same holds true for many banks, insurance companies and pension funds.  Governments also have the authority to crack down on, limit or outright ban certain activity. Much of the industry is waiting for the SEC, for example, to yet again flex its regulate-by-enforcement approach.  Fortunately, the U.S. has more experience and is more comfortable with decentralization than most countries.  Democracy understands decentralization  The debate about decentralization isn’t new – especially in the U.S. Our founders struggled with whether to centralize power at the federal level or to devolve more power to the states, and how much power to give people. Federalism and technological decentralization are different, but they spring from the same dilemma: whether to concentrate power in the few or the many. Bitcoin, as noted above, is slow and difficult to change because it’s so decentralized. So is democracy. Policymakers still struggle with this concept: Look no further than how the U.S. is approaching regulating stablecoins.  Stablecoin issuers, and many payment companies we all use daily, are regulated at the state level via money transmission licenses. But because stablecoins have grown exponentially, and show little signs of slowing down, the federal government seems to have decided that more centralized regulation is the best approach. But state regulators aren’t ready to cede that point. This was clear when the organization that represents state banking regulators responded to the PWG report by emphasizing states’ experience supervising stablecoin issuers.  States have always been labs of innovation, particularly as they relate to how to best organize economic activity. Wyoming, for example, has led the charge by becoming the first state to recognize decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as limited liability corporations. It will be years before we recognize the full benefits of that decision. And, in a unique twist that highlights how centralized and decentralized entities will need to work together, DAOs have to be domiciled in Wyoming to enjoy the benefits of the new law.  The struggle for how to best balance centralization versus decentralization is at play in another way, too. China has decided to launch its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a digital version of the yuan, prompting envy from some U.S. government officials who think the U.S. should have its own CBDC.  But why launch a CBDC when, without one even existing, privately issued stablecoins have gained market traction and helped cement the U.S. dollar as the reference asset for the entire digital asset economy?  How you answer that question says a lot about what you think about decentralization. None of the major dollar-referenced stablecoins are fully decentralized. But surely stablecoins are more decentralized than a CBDC would be and already play an essential role in facilitating decentralized economic activity.  This is just one example of the tradeoffs the industry and governments have to balance in the coming months and years. Regulators, too, clearly have their work before them: What innovations will they deploy to oversee decentralized organizations? If there isn’t a central organization whose door they can knock on when they want to enforce the law, what will they do? I admittedly don’t have the answer.  But what is clear is that advocating for only 100% decentralization – or only 100% centralization – will harm innovation.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jared Favole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/16/it-cant-be-decentralization-or-bust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/393fd3eed8ff2551b9ddf2a73480deac7b36d84a-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Flament, who was Circle’s managing director for Europe, is a French-born computer engineer who has also worked at luxury giant LVMH, Boston Consulting Group, Expedia’s Hotels.com and most recently banking app Mettle. She is credited with helping Circle add 2 million users over a two-year period, and had a hand in the launch of the popular USDC stablecoin.  She takes over the CEO role from Erik Trautman, who will continue as board adviser, according to NEAR co-founder Illia Polosukhin.

NEAR’s $99.6 million in TVL is just above fellow proof-of-stake upstart Algorand’s $89.2 million, though both are extremely distant from Ethereum’s market-leading $164 billion.  Flament told CoinDesk the distribution of funds and grants across the NEAR ecosystem constituted a unique opportunity to boost the network’s DeFi usage.  “It’s so important to think about how to create a diverse and inclusive open web, or Web 3, as it’s called,” Flament said. “It feels like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to actually participate and shape that direction.”  NEAR also brings with it scalability, speed and simplicity, said Flament. “From a technology perspective, NEAR has done almost everything that Ethereum 2.0 said it was going to do.”",POSITIVE,NEAR,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | NEAR | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/16/near-foundation-appoints-ex-circle-exec-marieke-flament-as-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fdb88dd0248508dae431188c3f4a12d8227f03ce-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Paradigm led the funding round, which also included A.Capital Ventures, Ethereal Ventures, Libertus Capital, Variant Fund, Scalar Capital, IOSG and others.  In addition to developer grants and product development, the funds will go toward legal work.

Aztec co-founder and chief technology officer Zac Williamson told CoinDesk in an interview that the company wants to provide thought leadership on how to create a compliant regulated payments network.  Read more: Aztec Launches Privacy Network on Ethereum  Aztec offers privacy-first zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups). Rollups aim to solve key scalability challenges of Ethereum, including slow transaction speeds and high fees for users. ZK-rollups run computations off the Ethereum mainnet and later submit transaction data to the main chain through a validity proof.  The Aztec Network essentially allows users to privately access their favorite layer 1 apps in a faster, cheaper way. Layer 1 refers to blockchains that run independently of other blockchains – as contrasted with layer 2 solutions that aim to speed up transactions on existing blockchains like Ethereum.  “Everything on the blockchain is public,” Aztec co-founder Joe Andrews told CoinDesk. “You need each node to be able to verify the state of another node and transactions. Everything needs to be public for that to occur. Aztec is effectively end-to-end encryption for those public messages. Instead of posting public transaction data, you post encrypted transaction data and the blockchain can still verify the correctness of that data using zero-knowledge proofs.”  Andrews added: “We basically enable the same or better privacy guarantees that you would expect from a Web 2 bank but running on completely decentralized infrastructure.”  Aztec’s first product was the private transfer protocol zk.money, which the company says has had over 20,000 registered users, 50,000 transactions and $35 million in total deposits.

With a $75 million raise backed by some of the world’s leading investment firms, on-chain analytics platform Nansen is now positioning themselves to do just that.  On Thursday Nansen announced the raise led by Accel and including participation from GIC (Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund), Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Tiger Global and SCB 10X, among others.  In an interview with CoinDesk, CEO Alex Svanevik noted that the company’s previous round brought in many of the top crypto-native investors, and that one goal of the raise was to reach new investors who could help expand Nansen’s horizons.

We want to have a foot in both worlds,” Svanevik said.  “If you want to make the future of finance become a reality, you have to reach beyond crypto’s bubble,” he added.  New products  Svanevik emphasized that one goal of the raise was “abundance.” Nansen is eyeing aggressively adding to its team of 55, expanding to new products and possibly even acquiring other teams if the industry begins to contract in a bear market.  “The next 12-18 months will be a phase of consolidation in the industry. Some great teams will join forces, some acquisitions will take place. I’d like Nansen to be well-positioned for that with a strong war chest,” he said.  Additionally, Svanevik said that while the primary audience will “always” be crypto-natives, the company is also scaling out towards institutions with products like the Nansen API, as well as expanding into more verticals like metaverse gaming data and non-fungible tokens (NFT).

Naturally there are adjacent categories that you might expand into.”  In addition to expanding into Web 3 gaming and adding to its suite of NFT analytics, possible categories for expansion include Nansen Research for institutional subscriptions, Nansen Query for analyzing data across multiple chains, and Nansen API, which will allow funds and institutions to programmatically call Nansen data.  Social analytics  The biggest feature Svanevik hinted at is a forthcoming “social” product.  “We’re going to make Nansen more personal, and we’re going to make it more social. I can’t disclose too much – we want to have a product people can use before we share it – but if you think about sharing information that you find on Nansen with other people, that should be easier than it is today,” said Svanevik.  This product may also coincide with more experimentation with tokenization and Web 3 assets.  “Nansen has very much been a Web 2 product operating in a Web 3 world. I think next year we’ll be leaning more into Web 3,” he said.  He made it clear there will not be a Nansen token sale, but the team would be “experimenting with Web 3 assets.” He declined to give specifics but said it was a key area of focus for the company.  Big vision  Svanevik said that in aggregate the new roadmap for the company is designed to position it as a “gateway” into crypto for both individuals and institutions.  “The idea is that, if we can help people be informed in all this wild west noise you find in crypto, then those pioneers of the wild west will re-invest in crypto, they will attract more people to join, and then ultimately crypto, [decentralized finance], NFTs, the metaverse – they will displace traditional finance and create the new financial fabric of the world,” he said.  Right now that process is in the early stages, but the space is already enjoying a surge in interest.  “I like to say DeFi brought the capital and NFTs bring the people,” he said.  Svanevik noted that at one point during the year 80% of users were exclusively using the platform for the NFT dashboard, and currently, institutional investors are forming a similar wave of interest.  “We’re talking about literally the top market participants in traditional finance who want to get more intelligence because they’re getting involved in crypto,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | ZRX | TOKEN SALE,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/16/on-chain-data-hub-nansen-eyes-aggressive-growth-with-75m-raise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2fce84a51ad5a15faec68115c64c175f9ed7b293-1752x1314.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411614,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4US,1639662600,The Top 5 Tax Tips for NFT Investors,"The non-fungible token (NFT) market has grown into a multibillion-dollar sector of the crypto industry, with top collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club trading for tens of millions of dollars or more.  Needless to say, it’s been a wild year for NFT investors, who should use the last few weeks of 2021 to prepare for tax season in April.  “Right now in December – before the year ends – you want to have an understanding of what your tax position is and your capital gains amount,” says Kate Waltman, a New York-based certified public accountant who specializes in crypto.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Just last year, says Waltman, the average client rarely asked his or her accountant or advisor about the tax implications of holding crypto and NFTs.  “But this year crypto has been a big part of the conversation,” Waltman says. “And I would say in the last four or five months this became the year that [clients] started paying attention.”  And so has the U.S. Internal Revenue Service: “The IRS is absolutely putting a focus on crypto activity,” says Waltman. “While they may not have the ideal infrastructure set up yet to be tracking and evaluating a lot of these crypto transactions, what I can tell you is that it’s a focus area.”  Help your clients prepare for tax season – even if they don’t plan on selling any NFTs this year. Read on to learn five important tax tips for NFT investors.  1. NFT purchases are taxable, whether or not you sell them.  The IRS classifies cryptocurrency as property rather than currency, Waltman says. So when you buy an NFT using cryptocurrency – like most NFT transactions – you’ll technically be buying and holding an asset for a short period of time.  “For 98% of NFT purchases, you need to use some form of cryptocurrency,” such as ETH, SOL or ADA, Waltman says. “By virtue of buying cryptocurrency, and holding it for a short period of time, you’re going to have a fluctuation in valuation of that cryptocurrency and then when you use that crypto to purchase an NFT.”  The IRS therefore sees NFT transactions as a simultaneous sale of your cryptocurrency and purchase of a new asset which is an NFT, therefore resulting in a capital gain or loss. Fortunately, platforms like CoinTracker provide a way to track your NFTs and more easily calculate capital gains.  “However, if you purchase an NFT using U.S. dollars, which is possible on some platforms, that’s not a taxable event,” Waltman says.  2. Clients should know the difference between short- and long-term capital gains.  “The important thing to keep in mind with selling an NFT that you previously purchased is whether or not you fall into the short-term capital gains bucket or the long-term capital gains bucket,” Waltman says.  The short-term capital gains bucket would mean that your client bought and sold an NFT within a 12-month period of time. If clients fall into the short-term capital gains bucket, their tax amount is their ordinary income tax rate.  If your client bought an NFT and held it for a minimum of 12 months and one day, then sold it, the client falls into the long-term capital gains bucket. The long-term capital gains rate is either 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on what their overall income amount is.  “For most people it’s 15%, and 15% is, generally speaking, lower than what your ordinary income tax amount would be,” Waltman says. “It’s usually advantageous from a tax perspective to try to fall into the long-term capital gains bucket and hold for 12 months and one day so you can reduce your tax bill.”  3. You can be taxed on airdrops and giveaways.  Social media giveaways are common in the NFT world. They usually come in the form of an airdrop, where an NFT creator or artist shares tokens with a community or follower base.  “If you’re receiving an airdrop from a giveaway that you won or a prize of some kind, you’ll likely know to expect that because you’ll be notified,” Waltman says. Whether your client has been involved in a new launch, commented on a particular thread or in a Discord channel, they should get a heads-up that an NFT is on its way to them.  While this is part of the thrill of NFT collecting, your clients should know the tax consequences.  “A lot of people have been sort of hoping that if you win a giveaway or an airdrop there are not going to be taxes. But as we know, the IRS always wants a piece of prizes and giveaways,” Waltman says.  Prizes and giveaways are going to be taxable at your clients’ ordinary tax rate (the USD equivalent value). This might be subjective, given the volatile and nascent nature of NFTs. But an accountant can use market data and blockchain records to confirm the estimated value of the NFT asset.  “A project like that has a well-established floor price will have a fair market value that is pretty readily available and easily determinable,” Waltman says. “Similarly, other blue-chip, verified NFT projects would also be pretty easy to determine what the USD equivalent value is. You can go to OpenSea or another NFT trading platform and look at the floor price and look at other comparable recent sales and determine the fair market value pretty easily.”  For newer projects that have just been created, the value gets a little bit subjective and so your clients, as taxpayers, simply have to make a good faith effort.  “Work with your accountant, do your best to determine what from the market has data,” says Waltman.  4. Gas fees can (and should) be counted in your capital gains.  “Understanding the tax treatment for gas fees is very important,” Waltman says.  Gas fees happen upon purchasing an NFT. Any time a buyer purchases an NFT, they will likely incur a gas fee unless the NFT creator has waived the gas fee for or reduced the gas fee amount. Known for being steep (on Ethereum, in particular), gas fees can run upwards of $200.  “That expense that you incur, think of it like a transaction fee,” Waltman says. “You will add the gas fee amount to your cost basis in the NFT. And so your cost basis becomes the purchase price of the NFT plus any gas fees or other transaction fees that you’ve incurred.”  An NFT’s cost basis is important because if your client later decides to resell the NFT, the gain amount is going to be decreased. For instance, if they purchased an NFT for $1,000 and sold it for $2,000, the gain would be $1,000. But adding a $200 gas fee to a $1,000 purchase puts the cost basis actually at $1,200. So the gain is only $800.  “That reduces the tax that you’ll pay later when you resell,” Waltman explains.  5. Tax planning is still (if not more) important for NFT collectors.  Tax best practices are just as important for NFT collectors – if not more so.  “Understand what your tax position is before the end of the year,” advises Waltman. “Right now in December, before the year ends, you want to have an understanding of what your tax position is and your capital gains amount, because then you still have a couple of weeks to make some decisions if you need to do any tax loss harvesting or make charitable donations or contribute to retirement.”  Tell your clients to not wait until Jan. 1 rolls around to print their forms from CoinTracker or another platform. By then, it will be too late for them to offset or prepare for large capital gains because they weren’t fully aware of the tax implications of NFTs.  “That’s the situation we don’t want to see people in,” Waltman ways.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | AIRDROP,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/16/the-top-5-tax-tips-for-nft-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79f0e914d755cea000ced1083d92c2085acb7420-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411613,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP4b4,1639662600,How Stablecoins Merge Traditional and Decentralized Finance,"Stablecoins, a term referring to cryptocurrencies that are pegged to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, first came to the scene in 2014. Tether (USDT), originally called realcoin, was launched as the first stablecoin that year. At the time, it was a very unique product, designed to bring the stability of the dollar (and other government-backed currencies) to the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Today, there are three main types of stablecoins: fiat-backed coins, crypto-backed coins and algorithmic coins. Fiat-backed stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are collateralized 1:1 with a specific fiat currency. Crypto-backed stablecoins are backed with a specific cryptocurrency, while algorithmic stablecoins are stablecoins that rely on a complex algorithm or algorithms to match the price of the cryptocurrency to that of a specific fiat currency.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  What are the use cases for stablecoins?  Stablecoins first gained popularity on crypto exchanges that did not offer fiat trading pairs. Most cryptocurrencies are quite volatile, and because of their volatile nature, many traders and investors needed a trading vehicle that provided stability and avoided this volatility. Because stablecoins are cryptocurrencies, they are able to be transferred between exchanges quite easily. This increases liquidity in the crypto economy and also allows traders to take advantage of cross-exchange arbitrage opportunities they might see. There are many popular stablecoins, such as tether, the gemini dollar (GUSD), USD coin (USDC), etc. In fact, there are two stablecoins in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap – tether and USD coin.  Another popular use case for stablecoins is lending and borrowing - particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) economy. Traders and investors will often borrow against a crypto position, or allow their coins to be lent out to other borrowers in exchange for the opportunity to generate yield.  Stablecoins provide a lot of the plumbing in the crypto ecosystem. Because there is demand for stablecoins, there is usually an above-average rate for borrowing and lending them. Investors are able to earn interest with stablecoins by depositing into various lending pools. Smart contracts – the code that runs crypto lending pools – are acting as traditional banks in this scenario, where savers are providing the liquidity to borrowers. Unlike traditional finance (TradFi), most liquidity pools provide instant liquidity. This concept is referred to as DeFi, and it is growing in popularity.  While stablecoins are designed to be “stable,” it’s important to understand the risks they involve. Each type of stablecoin has different risks, and advisors and investors must understand each one separately.  Fiat-backed: These are centralized coins. This means the issuer must hold fiat currency. Investors must demand proof of reserves with frequent audits. Examples: USDT, GUSD, USDC.  Crypto-backed: These are much more volatile than fiat-backed stablecoins. Proof of reserves is required, along with constant monitoring of the crypto used to back the stablecoin. Example: DAI.  Algorithmic-backed: Investors must research the code used to create the algorithmic function used to create stability. Example: AMPL, terraUST (UST).  Opportunities with stablecoins  Stablecoins provide a unique opportunity for advisors and investors. While they are designed to be stable and not volatile, they cannot and should not be used as a replacement for cash. And although it would be great to send bank reserves to a stablecoin position in order to generate an attractive rate of interest (especially during periods of inflation), it’s important to remember that these products are still new and unproven.  However, stablecoins do offer an attractive yield, allow for borrowing and lending, create tremendous liquidity in the crypto ecosystem and provide an uncorrelated (to other cryptocurrencies) asset that can be used for trading or as part of a diversified crypto portfolio.  Bridging TradFi and DeFi  In my opinion, the birth of stablecoins created the bridge that will connect the traditional financial markets to the wild world of crypto markets. I am more excited about the future of DeFi than I was about Bitcoin in 2012. As this new DeFi world evolves, advisors must be educated on the risks and opportunities this innovation will create. Navigating the next few years of the TradFi/DeFi ecosystem merging could provide opportunities unlike anything we’ve seen.",NEUTRAL,USDT,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/16/how-stablecoins-merge-traditional-and-decentralized-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e74963d0cc3a2890fca7992da5432c8d493510dc-4608x3072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sleeping in squat houses on the road. Crashing on couches. Duct-taping our gear back together. It’s a brutal lifestyle and every musician understands the struggle. Streaming revenue didn’t cover snacks at the gas station, let alone petrol to make it to the next show. It turned a career in music into a daily battle to survive, leaving little room for the creative work of making music and performing.  Joan Westenberg is a writer, angel investor and member of MODA DAO. This article is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment.  The state of the music-industrial complex is the definition of unfair. We live in a time where music has never been easier to record, distribute and listen to. It’s also never been harder to make a career out of creating. The truth is, creators rarely hold power and influence in the commercial side of the ecosystem. The industry is dominated by middlemen and streaming services optimized for corporate profits. The shares are rarely split evenly.  It’s a situation that might have artists – who may create for the love of it but still need to eat – second-guessing where to pursue a career in the music industry. Through NFTs and other cryptographic tools, that may change.  Take Spotify. With nearly 400 million active users, half of those paying, it is by far the most widely adopted and popular music streaming service. There are around 8 million artists on Spotify who fight for attention daily, only to be overpowered by more renowned counterparts like Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Kanye West. It’s a challenging landscape for any artist if they aren’t at the top, especially when artists aren’t able to wholly capture the proceeds from their work. “Rights holders” on Spotify pocket up to 70% of streaming revenue, and for the most part rights holders are not actually the artists.  This is not the proper way to reward creatives whose work is central to the human experience.  The next frontier  Technology hasn’t yet delivered a cure to the ailments of musicians, besides paving the way for an oligopolistic reality in the context of distribution. It’s arguably made things worse for artists by stripping away uniqueness and scarcity and standardizing everything almost to the point of no return.  Until NFTs came along.  Whether Spotify or Apple Music is on board, NFTs – or non-fungible tokens, a type of cryptographic asset that can guarantee uniqueness of digital media – will inevitably change everything about music distribution and rewire the foundation of the music industry. What does that mean in practice? More power to the creators driven by enhanced control over distribution and an imminent reduction of the current structural shortcomings of the industry.  NFTs reintroduce scarcity back to music and enable musicians to be in absolute command over the subsequent distribution of their work as far as it goes down the “consumption chain.” On top of that, NFTs open up many ways for artists to connect with their audiences on a deeper, more meaningful level and form the most vibrant of communities around them, effectively making music a more intimate human experience.  Transformational, to say the least.  What does that mean for you and me? More creators, more music and a more human experience. The reimagining of the music distribution model may usher in a renaissance for musicians and fans alike, creating vast opportunities across the board. In practice this may result in novel revenue models like revenue sharing, tiered access, direct one-on-one interactions.  Next year could be pivotal for music NFTs. There are a number of protocols and platforms coming online now, ready to put music center stage. NFT brands, like Bored Apes and CryptoPunks, are signing media deals – and albums are in the works. It’s a technology-driven revolution driven by creators.  At the same time, DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, the scorching hot topic on everyone’s lips, must also enter our consideration. If tired of the same old talent agents and record labels, DAOs could serve as a groundbreaking alternative in a new era of music.  See also: NFT Music Startup Sound.xyz Raises $5M From a16z, 21 Savage  Essentially a DAO is just a social group with a shared banking account and a procedure to make decisions together. For musicians, DAOs could function as brand makers, patrons and managers. Well-intentioned industry heavyweights may join to help out the next generation of artists creating on Web 3. Fans could join music-focused DAOs to amplify the human connection between artists and other music-lovers.  DAOs would eliminate the need for third-party intermediaries among artists, listeners and other stakeholders. Music industry imbalances could be addressed by DAOs, which could give artists a direct say in how their work is distributed and consumed, provide audiences with a direct connection to the musicians they support and give infrastructure layers like management and record companies the opportunity to interact with their core demographics and get closer to the music itself than ever before.  As a creator today, something feels different. The power structures have shifted. Speaking personally, the revenue I’ve been able to generate in NFT music has already eclipsed the sales of my last physical, record label-backed EP. If I was building my career for the first time today, I can’t help imagining how different it would have been. Creators launching their work now have access to a tool set that is incredibly powerful, a tool set we could have only dreamed of a decade ago.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MINING,Joan Westenberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/culture-week/2021/12/16/music-nfts-are-set-for-an-explosive-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c02feecfed36eaf895620e1e76524e460dfab28-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396303,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2fNu,1639661400,Ancient Rome Play-to-Earn Game ‘vEmpire’ Launches,"While the GameFi space has been pumped plump with institutional investment in recent months, the landscape of playable games in the ecosystem remains limited.  Most titles thus far have tried to emulate the format of Axie Infinity, where success is directly correlated to the hours spent played. Launched Thursday, vEmpire takes a different approach, modeling itself after the many strategy-based card games that have found their place in gaming communities for decades.  The game is a head-to-head battle between two players who can choose to be either Romulus or Remus, the sons of the god Mars and grandsons of king of Alba Longa, in the game (and a nod to the foundational myth of the city of Rome).  Players agree before the start of the game how much VEMP, which is the platform’s in-game digital currency, to wager in a winner-take-all format. Each player is then given a “legion” of 25 cards in their hand, each with different troops of varying abilities.  Both players take turns laying down a different card to earn points, and whoever earns the most points in two of the three rounds is declared the champion. Players can purchase non-fungible tokens (NFT) of specific cards to use to gain a competitive advantage.  vEmpire launched in July as a staking project for metaverse tokens such as MANA and SAND, with a pro-decentralization pitch of “invading” Decentraland. The buildout of the vEmpire world serves as a gaming interface for VEMP holders.  “We have been working to get this game out for the past few months whilst expanding all of our reaches across the metaverse,” Dom Ryder, founder of vEmpire, said via Telegram. “This game is called ‘vEmpire: The Beginning’ for a reason, we have lots more to come and this will be played across all metaverses available on our staking platform.”  UPDATE: (Dec. 16 18:57 UTC): Corrects the background of Romulus and Remus.",POSITIVE,MANA | SAND,AXS | MANA | SAND,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/16/ancient-rome-play-to-earn-game-vempire-launches-on-the-sandbox,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3397e5cb6e04172e0ddea28ffc85663708b5639-3072x2194.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If approved by lawmakers, the ban would only apply to new purchases of crypto assets not to past purchases, the report added.  Russia has been vocal in its stance against against cryptocurrencies, stating that the asset can be used for money laundering or to finance terrorism.  Bank of Russia’s current position is a “complete rejection” of all cryptocurrencies, the report says, citing a source close to the bank.  The central bank issued new rules for the country’s mutual funds in a directive published on Monday.  This latest change means funds cannot invest in digital currencies or in “financial instruments, the value of which depends on the prices of digital currencies.”  Bank of Russia is working on a ruble-backed central bank digital currency (CBDC).

The largest cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands near $48,700 at press time, representing a marginal loss on the day.  The BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 to increase the bank rate to 0.25% and by 9-0 to maintain the amount of quantitative easing at £895 billion ($1.2 trillion).  The central bank was expected to keep the rate unchanged at a record low of 0.10%.  The surprise increase challenges the narrative that central banks prefer to raise interest rates only after the end of quantitative easing or asset-purchase programs.  While the European Central Bank (ECB) kept key policy tools unchanged, it announced an end of net asset buying under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) in March 2022.  However, the 17-nation central bank did a balancing act by committing to boost an older asset-purchase program to €40 billion ($45 billion) in the second quarter of 2022 from €30 billion (34 billion) in the first  Bitcoin is staying resilient, perhaps tracking signs of risk reset in traditional markets.  The Australian dollar/yen currency pair is trading 0.6% higher on the day, extending Wednesday’s 1.18% gain and hinting at continued adoption of riskier assets following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish policy statement.  Futures tied to the S&P 500 added 0.6% alongside gains in other growth-sensitive assets like industrial metals.  On Wednesday, the Fed signaled three rate hikes in 2022, compared with market expectations for two, and doubled the pace of tapering, a reduction in bond buying, to $30 billion a month.  The immediate focus now is on the European Central Bank (ECB) rate decision due at about 12:45 UTC.  The ECB is expected to do the balancing act by announcing an end of the crisis phase while keeping the doors open for adjustments in both downside and upside scenarios.  As such, traditional markets are likely to extend their risk-on stance, which may end up putting a bid under bitcoin – all the more so as there are signs of large traders accumulating the cryptocurrency on the dip.  “Despite bitcoin’s recent 39% correction, the number of addresses with a non-zero balance continues to break all-time highs,” said Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K. based digital asset broker GlobalBlock. “Also, since the $69,000 all-time-high, the Canadian Bitcoin Purpose ETF has added 6,341 BTC in assets under management, representing a 26.2% increase in coin holdings.”  “This suggests institutional interest is prevalent at these prices and that whales are buying up bitcoin supply during this correction,” Sotiriou added.

Mumbai-based WazirX, which is an affiliate of the giant crypto exchange Binance, registered annual trading volume of over $43 billion, marking a stunning 1,735% growth over 2020, according to a report published by the exchange and shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.  “We witnessed over 700% growth in signups from smaller cities like Guwahati, Karnal, Bareilly, among others,” the report, titled “Highlights and Observations from 2021 The Year of Crypto,” said. “It shows growing crypto adoption in the semi-urban and rural India.”  While the exchange added more than 200 market pairs, bitcoin remained the most traded cryptocurrency, followed by stablecoin tether and meme tokens DOGE and SHIB, WazirX token (WRX), and Polygon’s MATIC.  Indian retail investors snapped up relatively cheap and more volatile coins like DOGE and SHIB, perhaps to make big money on a relatively small investment – a pattern observed across the globe, including inflation-ridden Turkey. Investor interest in these coins was exceptionally high in the lead-up to the Diwali festival held in early November.  While male investors dominated the action in the volatile meme tokens, women investors mostly traded bitcoin, the report said. However, the number of new female users increased 1,009%, outshining the 829% increase in male signups, a sign of demographic shift, also represented by crypto’s growing popularity in the young generation.  “Only 11% of respondents in the age group of 51 years and above said to have allocated over 50% of their total portfolio to crypto whereas the same is true for 29% of respondents in the age group of 18-24 years,” WazirX noted. “66% of WazirX users [are] below 35 years of age.”  Cryptocurrencies have emerged as an alternative asset class in India and worldwide, with central banks flooding the global economy with fiat currency in the wake of the coronavirus-induced crash of 2020.  “As more people began to read about crypto and invest in this emerging alternative asset class, WazirX witnessed a massive surge in user signups leading to us crossing 10 million users,” the report said.  “During these uncertain times [of coronavirus pandemic], crypto has not only enabled common people with new ways to earn online but also fought the pandemic with the Indian crypto community stepping forward to help our country,” WazirX added.  Crypto adoption has boomed in India despite lack of clarity on the regulatory front. The Indian government has been sitting on a crypto regulation bill for at least a year and is unlikely to table the same in the parliament’s ongoing winter session, according to local reports.  While the government has softened its stance on cryptocurrencies in recent months, the Reserve Bank of India remains anti-crypto, with governor Shaktikanta Das recently saying the decade-old blockchain technology can thrive without digital tokens.  However, WazirX is confident that the government will regulate rather than ban cryptocurrencies, and Indian institutions will follow the lead of their American counterparts in adopting crypto.  “The government’s impetus towards a regulated approach for crypto would put India on the world map with other developed countries dealing in crypto. This, coupled with strong institutional participation in crypto, would go a long way in paving the future of this popular asset class in India and helping us become Atmanirbhar Bharat [self-reliant India],” WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty said.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SHIB | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/16/indian-crypto-exchange-wazirxs-trading-volume-jumps-to-over-43b-in-2021,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The events highlighted by ISDA include forks, airdrops, cyberattacks and changes in law or regulation. The paper also seeks to explore how digital assets can be valued and what happens when that valuation cannot be obtained.  As a global standard setter, ISDA’s standards are incorporated for derivatives trading in mainstream markets such as bonds and equities. Having an equivalent template for crypto could be a boon for institutional investment into the digital asset market.  ISDA’s announcement followed less than a week after crypto exchange FTX’s U.S affiliate became a member of the association.

FREE tokens were distributed to contributors based on their initial donations to the DAO. DAOs, short for distributed autonomous organizations, are ostensibly leaderless online investment or organizational collectives formed to reach a common goal. In this case, the goal is to free Ulbricht from prison.  Token holders can now yield their power to govern the FreeRoss DAO treasury, which is made up of 1,390 ether worth over $5.5 million, according to CoinGecko data.  The “manifesto” on the official site is clear about the DAO’s motives. “We will Free Ross. We will advance prison reform. We will share Ross’ work with the world and give everyone a unique opportunity to own a piece of it,” it reads in part.  FreeRoss DAO was founded this month, but quickly gained popularity in crypto circles. The collective raised over $12.5 million and successfully bid over $6.2 million on Ulbricht’s non-fungible token (NFT) collection earlier this month. Proceeds go directly to the Free Ross campaign that helps prisoners meet their families as part of its work.  NFTs are blockchain-based representations of tangible or intangible objects of which artwork forms a use case. They are increasingly being used as a means of support and donations, as was the case of Ulbricht’s “Genesis Collection” NFT on NFT marketplace SuperRare.  FREE tokens themselves hold no monetary value and represent a fractional part of the Genesis Collection NFT.  Thursday’s distribution is in line with what FreeRoss DAO organizers stated before contributors were accepted: “The DAO will use leftover funds raised to free Ross and advance prison reform.”  Background, Silk Road and FreeRoss  Silk Road was one of the earliest ways to use bitcoin as a currency. Since its founding in 2011, online dealers on the marketplace sold ammunition, drugs, and other illegal services while getting paid in bitcoin.  The site ran until 2013, when authorities arrested Ulbricht on charges of money laundering and trafficking narcotics among others. They additionally forfeited 69,000 bitcoins belonging to Ulbricht – valued at billions of dollars today.  Ulbricht has since remained in prison, communicating periodically with the outside world via his Twitter account (all tweets are dictated by phone to an account controller in the outside world).  But a section of the online community has been trying to end Ulbricht’s incarceration. A support page created by his family has been running for over nine years. It appeals against the double life plus 40-year sentence given to Ulbricht for non-violent charges. It also calls for better reform for prisoners and a fairer criminal justice system in the U.S., apart from ending “excessive sentencing practices” and respecting an individual’s right to privacy.  So far, the movement has failed to gain widespread traction or attract big money. But crypto natives, armed with newly gained wealth, an affinity towards privacy and anonymous crowdsourcing mechanisms in the form of a DAO, might just change that.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/16/freeross-dao-distributes-governance-tokens-to-control-55m-treasury,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bd56b9abf8e3b4a6abb1d9e50d8f958e655851b-1200x822.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It makes it an easy environment to pull off scams worth millions of dollars. However, there are those working to stop scammers from invading the space. Here is a breakdown of some of the tools and firms working on solutions to fight back the scammers from the budding crypto sector.

13221695,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=479045,1639647887,Knowledge is Power: How To Stay Protected From Crypto Scams,"Crypto scams are increasingly prevalent as the surge in DeFi and NFT projects increases. From Discord server bots to imitation NFT projects on OpenSea, new ways of stealing cryptocurrencies through deceit continue to crop up. Most in the space are familiar with a typical rug pull scenario in which many invest in a new blockchain project, only for the project to later disappear and the owner to make off with all the investors&apos; funds. Others may have fallen victim to &apos;pump and dump&apos; schemes, in which wealthy holders of vast amounts of a cryptocurrency (a.k.a. &apos;whales&apos;) have been known to buy mountains of it cheap to drive up the price and increase its scarcity (thus creating FOMO), only then to sell it immediately, sending the price crashing down and then pocketing the profits. Here are a few ways you can protect yourself from scams. Watch Out For Community-Owned, Renounced Projects One way to avoid suffering the classic rug pull scenario is for the contract owners to renounce their ownership over to the community. Although this prevents a single entity from making an exit with all of a project&apos;s capital, renounced projects can also come with a catch. If there is an issue with the contract after launch, they will not be able to fix the issues and will have to re-initiate the project entirely. Take Advantage of New Security Tools Tech companies in the blockchain space have begun remedying some of these security issues.

42396305,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2fPs,1639647821,Solana Leads Gains as Cryptos Recover on Fed Decision,"Solana (SOL) led gains among larger tokens amid a broader jump in global markets. The crypto market has added almost $59 billion in value over the past day following the U.S. Federal Reserve decision to gradually reduce stimulus benefits and taper purchases of government bonds after inflation climbed to a 39-year high.  SOL, the fifth-largest crypto by market capitalization, climbed 12% Thursday to $180. Tokens associated with Ethereum rivals avalanche and elrond were also among top gainers in early European hours, adding 11% and 13%, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. Dogecoin and shiba inu saw muted growth after a rise earlier this week based on reports of electric-car maker Tesla allowing dogecoin payments for its merchandise.  Since early 2020, the U.S. has provided stimulus packages to businesses and individuals and the Fed has purchased nearly $120 billion in bonds each month to boost the economy. That has helped prop up financial markets worldwide while becoming a cause for concern among traders worried about the incessant money printing.  Yesterday’s decision bore well for the crypto market, however. While bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is considered a risky asset by many investors and traders because of its volatility, some view it as a hedge against inflation.  “Increased speed of tapering by the Fed has been a typical ‘buy the rumor sell the news’ story. Markets are looking for a tighter monetary policy as a response to record inflation,” Andreja Cobeljic, co-founder of trading intelligence tool Superalgos, said in a Telegram message. ”The short-term correlation between equities and bitcoin is positive and bitcoin also rose very sharply. It is worth noting that retail buying of bitcoin has been extremely strong on the lows, recent on-chain data shows.”  Bitcoin, ether see green  Bitcoin jumped from $46,000 to over $48,800 on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve meeting. It’s still battling a resistance level of $50,000, one it has tried to break on three occasions this month.  Futures traders are continuing to lean toward the upside, data from analytics tool Glassnode suggests. Funding rates – an hourly or daily fee paid by traders to borrow money from exchanges to place trades – remained positive, implying traders were paying to remain long on their bitcoin positions.  Ether gained ahead of bitcoin with a nearly $450 jump from weekly lows of $3,656 to above $4,000 at press time. The move helped alleviate earlier losses, but ether remains down 10% compared with a week ago. Funding rates for ether futures on Glassnode are negative, meaning more traders are paying to bet against ether’s upside.  Meanwhile, crypto funds like Singapore-based QCP Capital remain bullish on crypto markets continuing their upside.  “We think that a short squeeze into the year end or early January is very possible,” the fund wrote in a Telegram broadcast on Thursday. “Bullish divergences in ETH support our bullish bias and we expect both ETH and altcoins to outperform on a short squeeze.”  A short squeeze occurs when the price of a financial asset suddenly moves higher, prompting traders who’d bet it would fall to buy the asset in order to avoid greater losses, amplifying the increase. Bullish divergences, on the other hand, occur when asset prices fall to local lows but market momentum indicators do not, suggesting a lack of sellers in the market.",POSITIVE,SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/16/solana-leads-gains-as-cryptos-recover-on-fed-decision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/355dde7d96e8335ba20048fb391121b501c9bd00-4735x3158.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The note underscores the growing acceptance of crypto among older payment services companies and highlights their efforts to adapt to a changing environment. The three companies spoke at MoffettNathanson’s crypto and blockchain event earlier this month.  Visa sees crypto’s relevance extending beyond payments and itself as a layer 2, or companion network, that can operate on top of the blockchain network, as the company does with fiat-based networks. Visa is also expecting strong volume growth over the next one to two years from partnerships with crypto wallets, the company’s senior vice president and global fintech head, Terry Angelos, told MoffettNathanson.  Mastercard is benefiting through cross-border crypto on- and off-ramp flows at crypto exchanges and wallets, and sees crypto as an opportunity to build new products, said Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of blockchain and digital asset products. The company is also aiming to become an on-ramp to the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, and to add cryptocurrencies to its multi-rail network as native currencies for settlement.  Meanwhile, PayPal is investing in education-related initiatives in hopes of reaching a wider audience. The company is also working on opening its platform to allow interaction with decentralized finance (DeFi) networks, and the ability for users to transfer crypto in and out of its digital wallet safely, said Edwin Aoki, the company’s tech fellow and chief technology officer of blockchain, crypto and digital currencies.
