15648670,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545856,1691190039,Coinbase Research Expert Decodes Latest Crypto And Finance Market Trends,"Coinbase’s Head of Research, David Duong, has shared his insights on the recent market movements in traditional finance and crypto. He believes that current macro conditions suggest a temporary pause in the recent strong USD trend, which should support the crypto market. Related Reading: Is SUI Price Stability Under Threat Due To Transactional Boom And Bust? Key Crypto & Finance Movements Duong notes that the recent carry trades upset by the Bank of Japan’s decision to raise the hard cap on its 10-year bond yield have created instability across different pockets of the FX market. Meanwhile, the surprise decision by Brazil’s central bank to cut its benchmark SELIC rate by 50bps (compared to expectations of 25bps) has led to higher interest rates in some price currencies coming down. In the US, the yield curve steepened significantly following the rally in Treasury bonds only two weeks ago, as the US Treasury Department announced an increase in the size of its debt issuance plans. Although Fitch cut the US debt rating from AAA to AA+ due to concerns about the fiscal outlook, Duong believes this impact on bond yields was fairly limited. Duong emphasizes that the US dollar is more sensitive to front-end rates, and the 2y yield seems well anchored. This suggests a temporary pause in the recent strong USD trend, which should support the crypto market. However, he expresses concern that crypto performance may recouple with US equities in the short term, which may cap the upside on digital assets due to stretched valuations. Duong also discusses the recent exploit of four liquidity pools on Curve, which didn’t help risk appetite in the crypto space but didn’t sustainably accelerate the downtrend that’s been ongoing since mid-July. He believes the actual systemic risk associated with the exploit is limited by mitigating factors that offset some attack vulnerabilities. He also thinks this is not evidence of DeFi’s weakness but highlights the system’s antifragile properties. Related Reading: Crypto Trading Volumes Fall To Lowest Level In 2023 Amid Bear Market Woes Regarding market catalysts, Duong mentions the court decision in the Grayscale case (to convert its trust to an ETF), distributions from the Mt Gox Rehabilitation Trust to creditors, and any movement on the various Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) applications in the US. However, he notes that all those events are difficult to position for, so the market will have to wait for more information before pricing them in. Duong notes that flows on the desk have been balanced in the majors while altcoins have been net for sale. He also highlights Optimism’s OP token, which has traded better than expected, up 15% over the last 7 days, primarily attributed to the news around Base, Coinbase’s L2 on Ethereum. That chain, built on the OP stack, will broadly open on August 9. The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market stands at $1.13 trillion, which is consistent with its trading level since the start of August. Additionally, Bitcoin’s dominance level is at 50.25%, while its price is currently trading at $29,216, showing a slight decline of 0.1% over the last 24 hours.

The hacker, who had gained unauthorized access to the protocol, had earlier demanded that the Alchemix Finance team confirm the address to which they wanted the stolen funds returned. Curve Finance Breach Ends On Positive Note Curve Finance has announced the return of stolen funds worth over $60 million, which were taken in a recent exploit. As reported by NewsBTC, the protocol had issued a statement on Etherscan, urging the hackers to return the funds, and offered a 10% reward for their return. The hackers have agreed to return the funds, keeping 10% of the stolen amount. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Rebound Anytime Soon? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says The attack on Curve Finance, which took place on July 30th, significantly impacted the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and raised concerns about its security. The hack targeted several pools on Curve Finance, withdrawing more than $47 million from various DeFi projects. This led to a drop in the value of Curve DAO (CRV), prompting its founder, Michael Egorov, to sell off the asset to save it. Following the attack, Curve Finance has taken measures to improve its security, including updating its contracts and implementing stricter security protocols. The protocol has also called on the hacker to return the stolen funds and offered a reward for their cooperation. The hack had caused significant concern among the cryptocurrency community. Still, the Alchemix Finance team’s swift response and the hacker’s decision to return the stolen funds demonstrate the importance of protocols taking swift action to protect their users and assets. CRV Sees Strong Trading Volume Despite Recent Hack Curve Finance is one of the largest decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in the cryptocurrency market, with a total value locked (TVL) of $2.349 billion, according to data from DeFiLlama. The exchange has a market capitalization of $540.35 million and a fully diluted valuation of $2.035 billion, making it a significant player in the DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Bitstamp Makes Highly Anticipated XRP Announcement, But Does It Live Up To The Hype? The Curve Finance token (CRV) price currently stands at $0.62, with a 24-hour trading volume of $177.09 million. The staked amount of CRV is $432.64 million, representing approximately 80.07% of the market capitalization of the protocol. The data from DeFiLlama highlights the significant role that Curve Finance plays in the DeFi sector, with a substantial TVL and a high level of staked tokens. The liquidity available for trading on the exchange is also significant, with a high annualized trading volume and fees. The revenue generated by Curve Finance demonstrates the potential for decentralized exchanges to become profitable businesses, offering a viable alternative to centralized exchanges. Overall, the data from DeFiLlama highlights the significant role that Curve Finance plays in the DeFi ecosystem and the potential for decentralized exchanges to become profitable businesses. With its high TVL, staked tokens, and liquidity, Curve Finance is well-positioned to continue its growth and become a leader in the DeFi sector.

The token is now among the most searched cryptos ranking fourth on CoinMarketCap’s list of trending cryptocurrencies. However, the question remains: How long can XDC sustain these rallies? Are the bulls energetic enough to exceed the anticipated $0.1 price mark? Let’s see XDC Soars Amid Market Downturn, What’s Fueling Its Price Movements? XDC Network is soaring today, August 4, as the broader market slightly improved. With a bullish momentum, the token rose by 16.7% on Friday morning. Also, it emerged as the biggest gainer with over 45% seven-day gain and 162% 30-day value growth. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto Alert: The Implications Of Bill Ackman’s 30-Year T-Bills Short As of July 6, XDC traded at $0.03238 but later climbed to a monthly peak of $0.09092 on August 3, over 180% in the last 30 days. XDC reached a week high of $0.09134 on August 4, a nearly 50% increase from $0.05896 recorded on July 29. These impressive moves have positioned the token as the best-performing cryptocurrency in the 30-day and seven-day timeframe. Although the momentum is still bullish, it has stalled slightly since the asset has shed a few gains and shifted from the day peak of $0.09146 to $0.081. These gains could result from other ecosystem developments, including the partnership between XDC Network and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) Singapore. According to July 28 Bloomberg report, the crypto project integrated with IMDA’s TradeTrust – a Singaporean framework enables trusted interoperability of electronic trade documents across digital platforms. This collaborative effort will allow IMDA’s TradeTrust to verify and transfer documents. Such capability can enhance trade visibility, proof of authenticity, and origins of documents. The collaboration is expected to enable a seamless and efficient flow of goods between digital trading partners. According to the report, the partnership marks a milestone for the XDC Network, as it could expand its reach and user base. Such growth will likely lead to a significant spike in active transactions and trading activities and it could be among the primary factors fueling XDC’s rallies in the past few days. XDC Market Outlook, More Rallies Possible? The XDC/USD chart shows the token trades below the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence signal line. This indicates a bearish momentum as XDC sheds previous gains. Also, the RSI at 46.75 suggests the asset is approaching the oversold region. Moreover, the bears have formed stiff resistance at the $0.0851 level. They’re ready to push XDC down to lower lows if the bulls fail to regain momentum. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Poised To Reach $0.01 With Shibarium Upgrade, These CEOs Say However, if the bulls rally enough to push the price above $0.851, the next target zone will be the $0.09166 level, from where XDC will likely shoot to $0.1 if momentum is sustained.

To start with, let’s note that while a downgrade does reflect a moderately poorer outlook for the U.S. government’s finances, an actual default by the U.S. is highly unlikely, notwithstanding the Congressional game of debt-ceiling-chicken that periodically raises talk of a “technical default.” Countries that issue debt in their own currency rarely miss debt payments in the nominal sense, because they don’t need to. They can just print money to make repayments.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Of course, printing money to repay debts does not let governments off the hook. Doing so depreciates the exchange rate and reduces the currency’s purchasing power via inflation, thus imposing a form of tax on both the domestic population and foreign creditors. That undermines confidence among foreign investors and beads mistrust among taxpayers as a self-perpetuating cycle of collapsing exchange rates and higher prices arises.  In theory, these unhealthy economic outcomes should incentivize governments not to use expansive monetary policy to meet debts. But that assumes there’s democratic accountability, and international debt markets suggest that creditors judge different governments differently on that score. Many emerging-market governments across Latin America, Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe can’t issue debt in their own currencies because foreign lending institutions demand higher-than-affordable interest rates, leaving them with no option but to issue bonds in foreign currency – primarily in dollars.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Michael J.

Bitcoin NVT Ratio Has Formed A Historical Bearish Crossover The “NVT ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and transaction volume. In simple terms, what this metric tells us is whether the asset’s price (the market cap) is fairly valued compared to the network’s ability to transact coins (the transaction volume). When the ratio has a value above 1, it means that the price may be overinflated right now, as the blockchain isn’t observing the shift of any significant amount of capital. The risk of a correction taking place generally goes up the higher the metric trends above this mark. On the other hand, the indicator being below the threshold can imply that the market cap may be undervalued currently, and thus, a price surge may be due for the asset. In the context of the current discussion, the NVT ratio itself isn’t of interest, but rather a modified form called the “NVT golden cross” is. This metric compares the short-term moving average (MA) of the NVT ratio (10-day) to its long-term MA (30-day). As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, this NVT golden cross may be forming a pattern currently that could lead to a correction in the asset’s price. The below chart shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT golden cross and the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the same over the past year: The two metrics seem to have crossed each other in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT golden cross has been going down recently and has just crossed under its 30-day EMA. This line appears to have historically been significant for the asset, as the instances marked by the analyst shows. Related Reading: Crypto Storm Brewing: Bitcoin Vortex Indicator Flashes Buy Alert Generally, whenever the indicator has crossed below this EMA line, the cryptocurrency’s value has taken a hit. From the chart, it’s visible that this pattern has already held up a few times during this rally so far. Naturally, if this historical precedence is anything to go by, then the current bearish crossover might also lead to Bitcoin registering a drawdown in the near future. It should be noted, though, that the crossover may not be fully confirmed yet, as the NVT golden cross has only slightly gone below the 30-day EMA so far. So it’s possible that the indicator could turn itself around in the coming days and cancel out the cross. Related Reading: Will Binance’s Zero-Fee Trading Help Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices It now remains to be seen, whether the Bitcoin NVT golden cross and the 30-day EMA would keep going in the same trajectories and solidify the cross, or if the pattern would retrace.

42410028,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRvsL,1691178532,Is It 2022 Again? Comedian Adam DeVine Appears in Strange Ad for Crypto Exchange Bitget,"“Just a sec. I gotta make sure I win this digital auction for a super expensive, priceless piece of digital art that I'm hanging in my virtual beach house,” Adam DeVine says at the start of a new crypto ad. “Done! Got it,” he declares before launching into a perplexing pitch for crypto exchange Bitget.  It’s certainly not the first time a celebrity has partnered with a crypto exchange: who can forget Matt Damon’s “favors the bold” slogan for Crypto.com or FTX’s Super Bowl ad featuring Larry David? These ads made the former actor the subject of ridicule on “South Park” and landed the latter star in a pretty, pretty, pretty bad lawsuit.  At the end of 2022, CoinDesk named Matt Damon one of its most influential, but he got the nod for all the wrong reasons, noting “the Bourne trilogy actor’s Crypto.com ad is a proxy for all the cringe-inducing celebrity crypto shills you wish you could unsee.”  But here we are again, with Bitget tapping “Workaholics” and “House Party” creator Adam DeVine to capture the interest of younger investors “especially millennials and Gen Z,” the company noted in a press release announcing the comedian as the face of its #SetForChange campaign.  “Working with comedians, such as Adam, will allow us to lower the knowledge barrier, making crypto and Web3 more fun and accessible to attract more youth, who will ultimately be the key builder to bring our society forward, to a more crypto-friendly future.” Gracy Chen, the managing director of Bitget, said in the press release.  It’s not the first or biggest celebrity partnership the crypto exchange has announced, as it signed soccer superstar Lionel Messi as a spokesperson in October 2022 and tapped him to lead its #MakeItCount campaign in November 2022.  Messi had already dabbled in other crypto projects however, including launching NFTs as part of the “Messiverse” and accepting crypto as part of his signing deal with Paris St. Germain Football Club in 2021.  Since the launch of the single #MakeItCount video, Messi has been noticeably absent from other videos by Bitget, such as one where Chen leads a team to sing happy birthday to the athlete as a single candle burns in a cookie cake, though the athlete is not there to enjoy a slice.  In any case, times were different in October 2022, before the stunning collapse of FTX and ongoing crypto winter.  DeVine, while known to the younger generation Bitget hopes to target, is not known for dabbling in crypto. In fact a 2019 Getty Image of the actor calls out that specifically it is “not available for commercial purposes in NFTs (non-fungible tokens), cryptocurrency and advertising of NFTs or cryptocurrency.” To be fair, that may be Getty’s rule, not DeVine’s.  Choice of spokesperson aside, another strange thing about the ad is that it leans heavily on mentions of Web3 staples like NFTs, but also has DeVine reel off a number of things that people are doing everyday without blockchain or crypto like sending memes or streaming music. At one point he declares, “If you wanna stream a movie on TV while shopping on your tablet while exploring Decentraland on your phone, congratulations! You’re one of us.”  One of us who doesn’t know that metaverse platform Decentraland doesn’t work on mobile? Apparently.  In any case, Bitget has no such capability for sending memes or streaming content, and in fact doesn’t even have an NFT marketplace as part of its offerings. The crypto exchange does offer both spot trading and futures contracts and claims to be the biggest copy-trading exchange in the world, none of which are mentioned in the ad.  Bitget has been bucking industry trends during the crypto winter by announcing plans to expand hiring, starting a $100 million fund for Asia-focused Web3 projects and recently opened a Dubai office as part of its expansion plans.  But while DeVine spews cliches like “we are living in the now more than ever before, where the impossible becomes possible and anything we want is literally only a few taps of our fingertips away,” there is one key thing that isn’t possible for the American actor, or me either.  The strangest thing of all may be choosing an actor best known in America. No matter how much I tap my fingertips, Bitget isn’t available in the U.S.  See Also: Bitget Exchange Faces Lawsuit by Advisor of ReelStar Token Project After the Listing Goes Sour",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MANA | SPONSORED,Toby Leah Bochan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/08/04/is-it-2022-again-comedian-adam-devine-appears-in-strange-ad-for-crypto-exchange-bitget,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b0ff9a2983891622ce3f56395d321ec4bf22297-834x477.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15635296,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545826,1691175643,Bank Of Canada Study Shows Crypto Ownership In The Country Fell In The Last 2 Years,"A recent study by the Bank of Canada (BoC) has shown a decline in the ownership of cryptocurrencies over the two years. The BoC has attributed this decline in crypto ownership to ecosystem collapses, regulatory hurdles, and price depreciation. Bitcoin’s Decline Most Notable According to the Bitcoin Omnibus Survey, Bitcoin’s ownership across the country dipped to 10% at the end of last year. This decline has been attributed to various factors, including the significant drop from its all-time high due to the current market conditions, especially since Bitcoin’s price crashed over 50% from its all-time high of $69,044.77 last year. Related Reading: Will Binance’s Zero-Fee Trading Help Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices The survey also cited FTX’s unexpected collapse as contributing to the decline, as it prompted enhanced scrutiny from regulators while also creating doubts in the hearts of crypto investors. The decline in Bitcoin ownership wasn’t a result of investors moving their money to other crypto assets given that altcoins also suffered a similar fate to Bitcoin, as ownership in these digital assets also experienced a downward trend last year. The report read: Investors did not appear to shift out of Bitcoin and into other cryptoassets, as we observe decreased ownership of altcoins. There are some positives for Bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem, as Bitcoin’s ownership is still higher than the 8% recorded between 2018 and 2020. Another silver lining is that many locals are aware of Bitcoin (meaning they could invest in it in the near future), as general awareness of the token has been at an impressive 90%. However, despite being aware of the term Bitcoin, many Canadians still don’t understand how the cryptocurrency operates. According to the BoC’s research methodology, 61% of non-bitcoin owners showed low crypto literacy. Meanwhile, a meager 30% of Bitcoin owners exhibited high-level crypto literacy. Market remains highly volatile | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Financial Literacy Doesn’t Equate To Crypto Enthusiasm Many would have predicted that persons with higher financial literacy would be more bullish on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. However, that isn’t the case in Canada, according to the survey. Interestingly, respondents with a high financial literacy were the ones who were quick to exit the crypto market. In contrast, those with a lower financial literacy remained bullish despite the market conditions and regulatory concerns. Related Reading: CRV Price Recovers From 6-Month Lows, What’s Driving The Price? While these figures may not be so encouraging, there is enough reason to believe that the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide will impact the future of crypto ownership in the country as more locals gain crypto literacy. Furthermore, efforts from the authorities to provide regulatory clarity could also help as it will boost investors’ confidence in the country and consequently increase crypto ownership in the country.

42410032,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRw2G,1691174020,The Psychology of Failure and Its Meaning for Web3 Games,"Most gamers don’t spend much time analyzing why we game and what games we enjoy. In fact, much of the pleasure in gaming derives from the ability to disconnect from the real world. Nevertheless it’s worth asking: What makes gaming fun in the first place?  Richard Bartle’s taxonomy of player types uses psychology to provide clues as to which games certain gamers might enjoy by analyzing the way they play. And while his insightful 1996 analysis remains relevant nearly three decades later, it doesn’t explain why gamers game to begin with.  Adrian Krion is the CEO and Founder of the Berlin-based blockchain gaming startup Spielworks and maker of the user-friendly gaming wallet Wombat.  Many people see Web3 gaming as the next frontier of gaming itself, but so far the industry has been a little slow going. Is there anything crypto gaming could learn from the foundational principles of gaming to improve?  The psychology of failure  Renowned Danish game developer Jesper Juul also taps into the psychology of gaming by claiming that failure is a motivating factor among gamers. Juul posits in his 2016 book “The Art of Failure: An Essay on the Pain of Playing Video Games” that one of the main reasons people play video games is to fail, because it gives us the chance to learn and improve.  Read More: Towards a Web3 Without Wallets  In real life, we often view failure as a stop on the path to success, and it certainly serves as a motivating factor to help us overcome life’s challenges. But for video games – a recreational activity – the idea that failure could be a major motivating factor for gamers ahead of entertainment may sound absurd to both gamers and non-gamers.  In his book, Juul notes that “we generally avoid failure” in life, yet we “seek out games” where the experience itself either involves or is about failure. Juul refers to this as the “paradox of failure.”  This paradox doesn’t mean gaming isn’t fun, however difficult a certain mission or level may be. A game that is too easy is likely boring, but a challenging game that causes us to fail gives us the chance to improve. This has a powerful impact on the psyche and can be applied to other aspects of life. After all, improvement and overcoming adversity serve as confidence boosters.  Any gamer can tell you that beating an easy game or mission is far less satisfying than succeeding after multiple failed attempts. In this context, the failure paradox makes sense from a psychological point because when we overcome a challenge our brain responds by releasing dopamine.  “Dark Souls” probably provides us with the best example of this. The notoriously difficult action role-playing series from Bandai Namco boasts a loyal fanbase despite requiring a skillset that demands patience and the ability to recognize subtle patterns in the boss’s tactics to succeed. The game’s creativity, story, graphics and difficulty combine to make it so endearing.  Whether one eventually beats the boss or not, all good games know how to straddle the fine line between fun and frustrating.  Is Web3 all about the money?  But does this paradox of failure still apply to Web3 gaming? Considering the financial aspect plays a key role in this space, one might assume that turning a profit would negate the failure and drive to improve.  That assumption would be misguided.  Web3 communities tend to form around a collective sense of value and purpose, yet the ecosystem is undeniably individualistic. This is demonstrated through the pursuit of status symbols like unique NFTs, or being whitelisted for an exclusive airdrop.  Further, in the strongest Web3 gaming communities, not everybody gets to succeed. Failure is a part of participation, which hasn’t yet slowed growth.  In response to critics who claim Web3 gaming isn’t sustainable or fun (which may have held merit at one point), the industry has invested heavily in R&D, user experience and collaborating with traditional gaming businesses. The down market washed away a lot of flawed models and uninspiring storylines, and reignited an interest in gameplay, among developers.  These investments and industry-wide shifts flout reason if the primary motive of Web3 gamers were purely financial. (But for anyone interested, there are gamified sports-betting apps and plenty of other avenues for people who prioritize earning cash over a fun challenge.)  Still, Web3 gaming is projected to grow to over $65 billion by 2027 up from a $4.6 billion market in 2022. Even at a time when non-AI VC investments have trickled, the Web3 gaming sector is seeing a steady flow of new funding.  It’s true the thrill of turning a profit can add an exciting new element to gaming, one that Web3 games pioneered and then turned into a billion-dollar industry. But Web3 gamers still crave a fun experience and a challenging quest. Earning an NFT is as much about one’s status within the community as it is about cashing it in the marketplace.  Read More: Crypto and the Real Meaning of 'Radicalism'  Titles such as “Planet IX” and “Illuvium” marry enhanced storylines with breathtaking visuals, challenging and entertaining hardcore and casual traditional gamers as well as the Web3 crowd, while keeping the community spirit alive. The new generation of Web3 games are enticing gamers with well-crafted narratives, community-oriented models, and the freedom to own in-game assets.  As blockchain gaming passes a critical point, it’s safe to say Juul’s paradox of failure applies in the Web3 space as much as it does in the traditional gaming sector.  Web3 gaming is starting to disrupt the wider gaming industry. Down the road, expect to see mainstream gaming studios and franchises adopting their own versions of Web3 features: in-game economies, ownership of assets, and a community-first approach.  But crypto doesn’t have a winner-takes-all mentality. Advancements in smart contract design, token-based incentives and other gaming technologies will only benefit the world; that’s the spirit of open source development. And so the only way to really lose is not to play at all.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET,Adrian Krion,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/04/the-psychology-of-failure-and-its-meaning-for-web3-games,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50e593445ecaaa230ad450b8ed2ab7d5729b568d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15640898,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545813,1691172329,XRP Performance Woes: How Might Its Price Respond To Current Market Realities?,"XRP experienced a surge after Ripple Labs’ recent legal win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission, marking a partial victory. Nonetheless, the pace of this upswing has moderated in recent weeks, encountering notable resistance and initiating a downward trajectory. With the latest data from CoinGecko, the XRP value registers at $0.658512. This shows a 1.1% contraction over the preceding 24 hours and a notable seven-day decline of 7.4%. Related Reading: All Hype? BALD Meme Coin’s Volume Shaved By 96% During the height of its price surge after Ripple Labs’ legal breakthrough, its coin encountered a rejection near the $0.95 threshold. This particular zone mirrors the level it reached back in March 2022 during its bearish decline. This prompts the question of whether XRP is retracing its steps into a former range or if this constitutes a mere temporary retreat within an ongoing upward trend. XRP Dampening Sentiment Further impacting the prevailing sentiment around XRP, US District Judge Jed Rakoff has invalidated the approach taken in last month’s ruling concerning the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs. According to an XRP price analysis, the cryptocurrency has reached its zenith and is now poised to revisit its previous resistance level. Nonetheless, several crucial factors necessitate consideration beforehand. XRP is currently trading at the upper threshold of the expansive Bollinger Bands. While this signifies the potential for a retracement, it also signifies amplified volatility, indicating that any forthcoming pullback might manifest as notably severe. XRP price at $0.65 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Furthermore, the Stochastic RSI illustrates that XRP has surged to the overbought threshold at 80. This suggests a corrective pullback is probable, given that the market’s buying strength is waning. Traders Turn To New Coin As Alternative Amid the recent challenges faced by XRP, numerous traders have shifted their focus toward an emerging alternative – XRP20. This new option has garnered attention due to its modest market capitalization and unique advantages that set it apart from the original XRP coin. According to insights shared by analyst Jacob Bury, XRP20 holds significant potential for a price surge, leveraging the ongoing situation with XRP. The conventional XRP project has faced criticism for its centralized nature and the over-the-counter sales of XRP conducted by its founders. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Poised To Reach $0.01 With Shibarium Upgrade, These CEOs Say In contrast, XRP20 stands out as a fully community-owned venture. It has allotted 40% of its tokens for presale, another 40% for staking rewards, earmarked 10% for DEX liquidity and plans to burn the remaining 10%. The coin is not affiliated with Ripple, XRP or their ecosystem, its website says. One of the distinctive features of XRP20 lies in its extensive marketing achievements. The project has gained notable coverage from various prominent media outlets, contributing to a successful presale round that raised a substantial $300K in two days. This rapid fundraising underscores the growing interest and enthusiasm surrounding the coin within the trading community. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

42410047,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRwmY,1691172212,Bitcoin Little Changed This Week as Broader Crypto Gauge Sheds 1.6%,"The price of bitcoin barely fluctuated all week and is set to end Friday at around $29,200.  As measured by the CoinDesk Market Index, the broader crypto market lost 1.6% for the week.  Except for the drama around Curve Finance and its CRV token, major cryptocurrencies had a relatively uneventful week in regards to news and price movement.  While bitcoin (BTC) barely moved all week, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) fell 1.6% over the past five days, with more than 90% of its 183 constituents falling. That high percentage indicates weakening breadth within cryptos, even if the declines are relatively small.  Ether (ETH) added to its underperformance versus bitcoin this year, dropping 1.76% this week, compared with bitcoin’s 0.3% decline. With five months remaining in 2023, BTC has risen 76%, while ETH has gained 54%.  Within the CMI, individual top performers came via the Culture and Entertainment Sector, despite the group as a whole declining 5% on the week. Yield guild games (YGG) rose 57%, while origin protocol (OGN), added a less pronounced, but still impressive, 18%.  Among crypto assets with a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion, XDC network (XDC) led the way, jumping 33.5% on the week.  For the year, XDC – the token for a hybrid blockchain with a focus on global trade and finance – has risen 200%, taking the top spot among the $1 billion-plus market cap group.  What’s next for bitcoin and ether  Going into the next week, the obvious question is whether either of the two largest cryptocurrencies will make moves out of their current trading ranges. From a technical vantage point, current indications are that prices are likely to stay flattish for the foreseeable future.  Bitcoin’s and ether’s relative strength index readings of 46 and 45, respectively, are decidedly neutral and both are hovering near their respective 20-day moving averages.  There don’t appear to be many bearish indications either, which may give a measure of comfort to current holders. On-chain data has given no indication that either BTC or ETH is being moved onto exchanges, which can often precede a bearish move.  The week ahead in macro  The end of this week brought the U.S. July jobs report from the government. Though softer than economist forecasts, the jobs number had little effect on bitcoin's price. Next week brings inflation data for July, which could have an impact on market direction.  Forecasts are for both the headline and core July consumer price index to have risen by 0.2% versus 0.2% gains for both gauges in June. The headline year-over-year rate is expected to rise to 3.3% from 3% and the yearly core rate is seen dipping to 4.7% from 4.8%.  Digital assets, however, have done a fair job recently of pricing in macro expectations.

42410042,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRwSi,1691169379,Did Razzlekhan’s Husband Really Hack Bitfinex?,"We seemingly have an answer to one of crypto’s most enduring mysteries. Ilya Lichtenstein, husband of criminal rapper Razzlekhan (aka Heather Morgan), confessed yesterday to the 2016 hacking theft of 120,000 bitcoins from offshore crypto exchange Bitfinex. But the circumstances of that confession are frankly bizarre – and one of America’s most notorious reformed hackers isn’t buying it.  “Ilya is a f***ing idiot,” argues Brett Johnson. “If you look at the way he was trying to launder money, he was doing absolutely everything wrong.”  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Johnson should know – he was the founder and leader of Shadow Crew, a notorious cybercrime cartel, in the early 2000s. After his arrest in 2005, Johnson served as a confidential informant for the Secret Service and, despite some backsliding, has since become a respected white hat cybersecurity expert.  Aside from questions about Lichtenstein’s competence, the circumstances of the confession remain murky. The U.S. Department of Justice did not charge Morgan and Lichtenstein, who Morgan sometimes affectionately referred to as “Dutchie,” with the hack itself, only with attempts to launder the stolen funds.  It is unclear from yesterday’s reporting whether confession to the hack was a condition of Lichtenstein’s plea deal on the money laundering charges, but that would be extremely unusual. The roughly 120,000 BTC hacked from Bitfinex was worth about $70 million in 2016, but ballooned to $4.3 billion by the time of the couple’s arrest last year.  After Lichtenstein and Morgan’s arrests, there were still many unanswered questions as to who actually committed the initial hack. One theory was that Lichtenstein and Morgan may have purchased keys to the stolen bitcoin from the original hacker at a discount, or were holding and laundering it on behalf of a third party. But these were never particularly convincing, and there was broad belief that the couple had committed the hack as well as the attempted laundering.  Brett Johnson is skeptical, though, based on Lichtenstein’s apparent sloppiness on the laundering part of the heist.  “He was doing chain hopping … But the cashout was always coming out to his name. In Shadow Crew, we said, all cybercrime should start with identity theft,” Johnson told me. “[Lichtenstein] even had some Coinbase accounts that were directly connected to him. It simply did not make sense at all that he was doing it like that.”  Lichtenstein also moved some of the stolen funds through darknet market Alphabay. But, Johnson argues, “If he had any experience at all, he knew that market was going to get shut down by law enforcement, or do an exit scam. So it doesn’t make sense to me.”  “What it really reads like is, in theory the guy knows how to launder money, but in practice he had never done it at all,” he added  Another major sign of the duo’s questionable competence: Lichtenstein apparently kept the private keys to billions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin on a cloud drive, which may have allowed law enforcement to seize it.  See also: 'Razzlekhan,' Husband Agree to Plea Deal in Bitfinex Hack Case  More broadly, Razzlekhan and Dutchie’s behavior post-2016 was strange for high-profile hackers. Rather than disappearing to some remote non-extradition country, they moved to Wall Street. And while Lichtenstein kept a low profile, Heather Morgan’s behavior was incongruous with someone who had millions of stolen bitcoin on hand. She touted herself as head of an email marketing company, contributed articles to Forbes, gave public presentations on hacking and – last but not least—pursued a possibly theft-subsidized career as a bizarre rapper under the alias “Razzlekhan.”  That may simply indicate that the couple made extremely naïve decisions after committing a major crime. But Brett Johnson thinks there’s a lot more to the story.  “It doesn’t ring very true to me at all.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

Spot trading volumes dipped by 10.5% to $515 billion, while derivatives volume dipped by 12.7% to $1.85 trillion. This slump has been attributed to the low volatility in the price action of the two leading crypto tokens – bitcoin and ether. Both tokens have continued to experience sideways price movement since the beginning of July, thus keeping the market players out as they await a breakout. Binance Continues To Lead The Pack Despite Regulatory Concerns According to the latest exchange review report, Binance remains the largest crypto exchange by spot trading volume, recording $208 billion in trading volume for July. However, it wasn’t all good news for the exchange as its market share declined for the fifth consecutive month in July, dipping to 40.4% – its lowest since August 2022. Related Reading: Buying Pressure Incoming? MicroStrategy Files Notice With SEC To Sell $750 Million In Stocks The decline in Binance’s market share has been attributed largely to the firm’s ongoing legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In July, the SEC accused Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, of offering different tokens, which the regulator has tagged as “unregistered securities,” to the public. Binance’s regulatory battles might have forced traders to seek alternatives as they fear the worst might happen to the crypto exchange. “The recent concerns over possible regulatory action against Binance seem to have adversely affected the trading activity on the exchange, with users likely to prefer other alternatives,” said Joseph, a research analyst at CCData, in a note to CoinDesk.

This figure put Upbit ahead of rivals OKX and Coinbase (the first time this is happening), with both crypto exchanges’ volumes dropping 11.6% and 5.75%, respectively. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Heat Up As Filings With SEC Climbs To Six “Compared to last month, Upbit saw the largest increase in market share, with the exchange now accounting for 5.78% of the trading volumes on centralized exchanges,” the report elaborated. Upbit wasn’t the only South Korean crypto exchange that enjoyed a remarkable uptrend last month. According to the report, other South Korean exchanges like Bithumb and CoinOne also saw an increase in their trading volume.

Coinbase Makes a Major Move in SEC Lawsuit On Friday, July 4, Coinbase filed a new motion seeking to dismiss the lawsuit started by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) entirely, after hinting at the major move in yesterday’s Shareholder letter on the platform’s Q2 earnings. In the filing, Coinbase claims that the regular is exceeding its authority by suing the cryptocurrency exchange because the platform does not offer “investment contracts”. ""The transactions over Coinbase’s platform and Prime are not, and do not involve, contractual undertakings to deliver future value reflecting the income, profits, or assets of a business. They are commodity sales, with the obligations on both sides discharged entirely the moment the digital token is delivered in exchange for payment,"" the filing stated. The crypto exchange also referred to the recent ruling partially in favor of Ripple in a similar case against the SEC, saying that the core facts were ""substantially identical to those alleged here."" However, there’s no guarantee that the court will consider this argument, because another crypto company Terraform Labs also recently tried to cite the Ripple’s case but was rejected by Judge Rakoff. Ongoing Legal Battle Against SEC As it was recently revealed, before suing the exchange, the SEC first asked Coinbase to halt all crypto trading except that of Bitcoin, arguing that all other digital assets are viewed as securities. Coinbase decided to decline the SEC’s request. The company’s CEO Brian Armostrong explained why: “We really didn’t [did not] have a choice at that point; delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way, is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US. It kind of made it an easy choice… let’s [let us] go to court and find out what the court says.” In June, the regulator filed suit against Coinbase alleging the platform failed to register as a broker, clearing agency, or national securities exchange and traded at least 13 cryptocurrencies that could be considered securities. Seeking Regulatory Clarity Coinbase has repeatedly asked for more clarity regarding crypto regulation from the SEC but still hasn’t responded. The regulator requested four more months to provide a response to the platform’s call. In its latest Shareholder letter, Coinbase highlighted: “…despite our good faith efforts and transparency of our business to the SEC for years now, we were deeply disappointed that the SEC brought an unwarranted enforcement against us in June, and that ten states initiated proceedings about our staking services. We are confident in the work we have done to abide by all federal and state securities laws, and as we vigorously defend that work, we plan to use these proceedings as an opportunity to bring more clarity to our industry as a whole.” Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal expressed optimism regarding the case: “With respect to the litigation with the SEC, I want to be very clear.

""Officially, my campaign is accepting bitcoin,"" Suarez said. ""This is a process of developing technologies that are going to create democratizing opportunities for wealth creation and are not manipulated by a human being's ulterior motives, political goals, etc."" he said.  Supporters can donate as little as 0.00034 bitcoin, or the equivalent of $1, at FrancisSuarez.com, he said.  Suarez was critical of the Biden administration's handling of crypto.  ""The biggest mistake that this administration has made is they don't understand crypto, so they have gone to a regulated-by-enforcement mechanism as opposed to set the ground rules,"" Suarez said on CoinDesk TV. ""You have to be able to classify certain digital products, you have to be able to have certain guidelines and rules that are clear with respect to the custody of assets.""  Suarez also said that he would ban a central bank digital currency. ""Nobody wants the federal government knowing where you have your money and how much money you have ... I don't think that there's anything particularly innovative about that,"" he said.  Suarez, a Republican, announced his candidacy for president in June, entering a crowded race for the GOP nomination that includes front-runners former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.  The move to allow bitcoin payments for donations should come as no surprise given that the Miami mayor has long been an advocate for digital assets, specifically bitcoin, which he has said will have a “democratizing impact on the future of wealth for every American.” He has vowed to make Miami a bitcoin hub and has accepted his salary in bitcoin.  Suarez has already experimented with crypto assets in multiple areas, including by launching MiamiCoin (MIA) in 2021, which he planned to someday be used to pay a recurring bitcoin stimulus to Miami citizens, similar to a dividend paid to shareholders of a company.  The cryptocurrency has struggled, however, with its value down about 95% since its launch. But Suarez remains highly involved in the industry and has argued that the country needs a president who understands the technologies around crypto and artificial intelligence.

First, here is a chart that shows the data for two of the Bitcoin indicators that are of interest here: The trend in the active addresses and ratio of volume in profit to loss | Source: Santiment on X As you can see in the above graph, there are two indicators of relevance here: the “daily active addresses” and the “ratio of on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss.” The former of these naturally keeps track of the total number of unique addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain that are taking part in some kind of transaction activity on the network. From the chart, it’s visible that this metric has observed a large spike recently, suggesting that a high number of addresses have become active. Generally, a large number of addresses making transfers on the chain implies that a high amount of users are making use of the chain right now. The current value of the metric suggests that more than a million addresses have been active recently, which is the highest that the indicator has been since the middle of April. Such an increase in utility suggests that there is a large amount of interest in the coin at the moment. Now, the other metric here measures the difference between the profit-taking and loss-taking volumes on the Bitcoin network. As is visible in the graph, this indicator has a negative value currently, which means that the majority of the selling in the market is happening at some loss. These negative levels of the metric are similar in scale to those observed back during the March plunge. Historically, bottoms in the price have become more probable to form when investors are capitulating like this, as the coins of the weak hands are picked up by the strong hands in such periods. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto Alert: The Implications Of Bill Ackman’s 30-Year T-Bills Short If a rebound move does arise from this capitulation, then its timing may be ideal, as a high amount of active addresses can mean the presence of a large number of traders who can help fuel the move. Additionally, the Bitcoin millionaire and billionaire addresses have also been behind the asset recently, as they have added 27,755 BTC to their holdings since May. The value of the metric has been trending up recently | Source: Santiment on X Based on these factors, it’s not hard to believe that a rebound in the cryptocurrency’s price might take place in the near future, although it may only be a short-term move.

42410034,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRw8s,1691164782,Avalanche Blockchain Usage Grew in Second Quarter: Nansen,"Usage of Avalanche, the seventh-largest smart contract platform, more than doubled in the second quarter, even as users committed less of their cash to the system.  Daily transactions on Avalanche C-Chain, an implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, grew to just under 500,000 from roughly 200,000, and the number of daily active addresses ranged between about 25,000 and 117,000, settling around 95,000 at the end of the quarter, blockchain analytics firm Nansen said in a research report.  At the same time, DefiLlama data show the total value locked on the layer-1 blockchain slid almost 20% to $695 million in the period, moving similarly to the price of Avalanche's native token AVAX.  Despite the crypto bear market, “the steady increase of active addresses, coupled with the rise in daily transactions, is indicative of healthy growth within the ecosystem and showcases the flourishing community supporting Avalanche,” said the report.  Interoperability protocol LayerZero and Stargate, a cross-chain bridge that leverages LayerZero’s technology, both played a role in Avalanche’s growth as two of the top entities by users and transactions on the C-Chain, “which could indicate a potential airdrop opportunity,” Nansen said.

What are crypto market experts saying about future targets for these three cryptos? Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Chainlink (LINK) Price Prediction Chainlink (LINK) caught the attention of many investors and traders for its major rally during the bear market of June. From June 20 to July 20, the price of Chainlink spiked by almost 70%. Starting at $5.1, Chainlink traded as high as $8.4 in July. Chainlink now appears to have broken market structure, entering a bear market. Over the last two weeks, the price of Chainlink has tumbled by 15%. In addition, the number of whale transactions on Chainlink is now 78% fewer than they were two weeks ago. The price of Chainlink now stands at $7.3, but data from Global In/Out of Money Around Price (GIOM) remains bearish. According to the firm, the price of Chainlink could continue its decline in the coming weeks and drop to the $6.5 support. Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction Uniswap also enjoyed a massive rally from June to July, increasing by 60%. Following its peak at $6.7, the price of Uniswap has tumbled down to $6.22. Despite growing bearish pressure, the price outlook of Uniswap remains fairly bullish. With support at $6.0, the number of buyers are overtaking the number of sellers. If buyers successfully hold this price at the 200-day SMA, Uniswap could see a price increase in the coming days. However, the overall outlook of the crypto market could contribute to this. Crypto analysts at Changelly have predicted that the price of Uniswap could top $7 in August. For 2023, the analysts have forecasted a maximum price of $8.44 for Uniswap. Pomerdoge (POMD) Price Prediction Unlike Uniswap, crypto experts are more bullish about the prospects of Pomerdoge (POMD) in the coming weeks. Creating a revolutionary P2E game, crypto experts have given very bullish predictions for Pomerdoge. In the Pomergame, players will create unique characters known as Pomerdoges.

With the prospects of combining the best features of top P2E games, the Pomerdoge utility token has been given very bullish ratings. Now in its first presale stage, you can buy a POMD token for as low as $0.007. However, crypto experts have predicted a 280% price surge over the next few weeks as the project prepares for launch. One feature that has caught the attention of investors is the shared earnings of Pomerdoge.

The exchange kept its promise and made the announcement. However, did it live up to the expectations and hype? The Big Announcement Popular digital asset exchange platform Bitstamp has recently unveiled its highly anticipated XRP announcement. The new feature allows users to stake their XRP holdings and earn long-term 2% APY in rewards. This offering is part of the platform’s creative Bitstamp Earn Lending Program, which offers users a reliable and secure means to lend their XRP holdings and earn rewards in return. Related Reading: CRV Price Recovers From 6-Month Lows, What’s Driving The Price? Bistamp’s lending service stands out because of its numerous benefits that provide participants with confidence in the whole lending procedure. Bitstamp will also not convert or lend users’ assets without explicit consent and instructions. To partake in XRP staking, users of the platform can easily navigate to the Earn Lending column on Bitstamp. While on the section, they will be offered an option to stake their XRP and earn the mouth-watering 2% APY rewards. To bolster trust and entrench transparency, Bitstamp has partnered with Tesseract, a renowned firm that is specialized in exclusive lending to trusted borrowers. Tesseract will conduct thorough credit and risk evaluations on all prospective borrowers, thereby augmenting the general safety and reliability of the lending service. Bitstamp will also render monthly performance reports to enhance transparency. The reports will cover key metrics, such as the risk profile of borrowers, portfolio concentration, and collateral levels. XRP price shakes off Bistamp announcement | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Members of XRP React The recent announcement has sparked a wave of expectations and reactions within the XRP community. The announcement of the 2% APY on XRP lending has been met with disappointment as community members expected a more groundbreaking revelation. Community members had previously speculated on the nature of the announcement, with some XRP proponents speculating that Bitstamp may consider a full integration with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) decentralized exchange (DEX).

42410029,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRvyx,1691159674,Coinbase Bears Doubt Stock Can Rise Even After Exchange Beats Estimates,"Coinbase (COIN) failed to assuage analysts’ long-term concerns even after the crypto exchange reported second-quarter results that beat estimates.  Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Barclays all noted the beat, but expressed caution over growth prospects.  “Ultimately, we struggle to see a favorable valuation argument for the stock given that the company’s revenue base is tethered to an asset class that has yet to show a sustainable everyday utility value, as well as the significant levels of stock based comp, despite being profitable on an adjusted basis,” Goldman Sachs analysts led by Will Nance wrote. “Until we see evidence of mass adoption of crypto for everyday utility, we believe fundamentals will remain challenged.""  The bank maintained its sell rating on the shares, but increased its 12-month price target to $51 from $45. The stock was down 0.3% to $90.48 in early Nasdaq trading.  “While some 2Q metrics were positive and the 3Q outlook contained no surprises, the print did little to address critical questions around retail volumes and revenue diversification,” Bank of America said. It rates the stock at underperform. It left its price target unchanged at $58.  JPMorgan, with a neutral rating, raised its price target to $64 from $61. The bank said the significant beat was driven by higher-than-expected retail transaction fees and “well-controlled” expenses.  Still, volume was underwhelming in the second quarter with the third quarter tracking worse, and Coinbase appears to be losing market share to competitors Robinhood Markets (HOOD) and Block (SQ), JPMorgan said in a report. The bank estimates that staking revenue will grow to around $97 million in the third quarter given the higher ether (ETH) yield seen in July, the increase in ETH staked and the greater number of validators.  Regarding the lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, “management struck a strong tone as they think they can win” Barclays said. It rates the stock at underweight and maintained a price target of $70, saying second-quarter earnings beat estimates because of a higher take on retail transactions and lower operating costs.  Late on Thursday, Coinbase reported second-quarter revenue of $708 million and a loss of 42 cents a share. Analysts expected revenue of $628 million and a loss of 76 cents a share.

In a message linked to an Ethereum blockchain transaction, the looter asked Alchemix, one of the victims of the heist, to confirm the protocol's address where he could return the assets. Soon after, he transferred almost $10 million of ether (ETH) and alETH to Alchemix's multisignature wallet in multiple transactions, blockchain data on Etherscan shows.  CRV, the governance token of Curve, jumped on the news and is up 5% over the past 24 hours.  The transactions spur hope that most of the stolen assets will be recovered to victims in one of the most dramatic crypto exploit this year. Curve, Metronome and Alchemix lost $61.7 million of crypto assets over the weekend when an unknown hacker exploited a coding bug to loot multiple trading pools.  On Thursday, the affected protocols offered a 10% bounty for returning the assets by Aug. 6, CoinDesk reported.  The Curve exploit roiled the decentralized-finance sector as anxious investors yanked out assets as a precaution. CRV token's price fell as much as 31% to 50 cents in the aftermath.  Read more: DeFi Died and We Didn’t Even Notice  The plunge put Curve founder Michael Egorov's loans secured with $168 million CRV at risk of liquidating.

Sustaining this heightened market position presents difficulties, as demonstrated by the recent performance of the Sui token’s value. Sui token is currently priced at $0.591478, according to CoinGecko, with a 0.3% drop in the past 24 hours and a 6.0% decrease over the past seven days. The Sui network experienced a big surge, reaching unprecedented heights before undergoing a sharp decline recently. Have other indicators and the token’s valuation borne the impact of this plunge? Sui Network’s Transaction Surge And Diverging Trends A recent report indicates an interesting pattern in the Sui network’s daily transaction block numbers, which commenced in early July. Starting at around 200,000, the transaction count surged to 500,000 and dramatically jumped to over 6 million within a day. Related Reading: Kaspa (KAS) Takes Off With 23% Burst – What’s Fueling The Thrust? This peak brought the total transactions to an impressive 65.8 million, accompanied by an all-time high for the platform and its blockchain. SUI is currently trading at $0.59 according to the daily chart on TradingView.com However, the excitement was short-lived as the transaction count quickly settled at approximately 720,000. Interestingly, the network’s activity volume showed a minor decline, stabilizing at about $2 million. The Total Value Locked (TVL) took a different trajectory. Despite the transaction surge, the TVL demonstrated a subtle upward trend, currently at around $14 million, according to DefiLlama. Assessing Sui Token’s Stability And Prospects The Volatility Gauge evaluates recent trends, allowing it to form a score that reflects the current market dynamics rather than being skewed by isolated fluctuations. This methodology provides a more comprehensive understanding of the token’s price behavior. SUI total value locked. Source: Defillama As noted in a separate analysis, the SUI token demonstrates a moderate level of volatility. A low score on the Risk/Reward Gauge complements this average volatility. This pairing indicates that while the token experiences moderate price swings, it is also safeguarded against undue price manipulation. This confluence of factors presents a balanced perspective on the token’s risk and potential rewards. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Poised To Reach $0.01 With Shibarium Upgrade, These CEOs Say Looking ahead, the Sui token’s price is favorably poised. The support level is thoughtfully established at $0.568754, which signifies a point where downward pressure could find a halt. On the other hand, the resistance level is strategically set at $0.606822, indicating the end at which selling pressure might increase. This positioning offers Sui token an advantageous space to navigate before encountering significant selling pressures. It suggests that the token has room to flourish within this range, indicating a positive trajectory soon. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

15633671,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545825,1691156197,Crypto Storm Brewing: Bitcoin Vortex Indicator Flashes Buy Alert,"Bitcoin has flashed an important high timeframe buy signal on the Vortex Indicator. Find out why this suggests a storm of buying could be brewing in crypto — and why it could soon suck up everything in its path. Forecasting A Storm in Crypto Like a meteorologist can with some degree of accuracy forecast the weather, a technical analyst can increase the probability of predicting price movements. Both fields rely on on watching for potentially cyclical behavior, repeating patterns, seasonality, and historical trends. But instead of classifying cloud formations, technical analysts rely on Ichimoku clouds expanding and contracting with volatility, or other similar tools. Related Reading: This Long-Term Bitcoin Price Average Is Setting ATHs Yet another technical tool related to the elements, the Vortex Indicator, says that Bitcoin buying season is around the corner, and once it starts, it could suck in everyone that’s sidelined and then some. The Vortex Indicator has given a buy signal | BTCUSD on TradingView.com About The Bitcoin Vortex Indicator The 1M Bitcoin Vortex Indicator has crossed bullish. According to Wikipedia, a buy signal triggers when VM+ crossed above VM-. First revealed by creators Etienne Botes and Douglas Siepman in 2010, the tool helps “identify the start of a new trend or the continuation of the existing trend.” Notably, in the past, each time the buy signal triggered, the bottom in Bitcoin was in. Even during the COVID collapse the monthly Vortex Indicator didn’t give another sell signal. Also worth mentioning is the fact that it appears to give its signal on the later side, after a bear or bull market is already visible. This speaks to the tool’s use for confirming trend changes. Only a handful of the buy side signals have triggered in BTCUSD history, and each time cryptocurrencies stormed substantially higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Are The Tightest Ever, What Happens Next? The Vortex Indicator was inspired by the work from Viktor Schauberger, an Austrian forest caretaker, naturalist, philosopher, inventor and pseudoscientist. Schauberger studied the flow of water in rivers and turbines during his career. Etienne Botes and Douglas Siepman developed the “idea that movements and flows within financial markets are similar to the vortex motions found in water.” In nature, vortices are powerful forces inherent to whirlpools, tornados, and other powerful storms, known for sucking in everything in its path. Even the Great Red Spot on Jupiter is a vortex circling uncontrollably for hundreds – potentially thousands – of years. With this storm potentially changing direction, a wave of buying could be in the forecast.

The capital will help D8X launch a decentralized derivatives trading platform in the second half of 2023 that provides a white-labeling solution to trading partners seeking access to powerful derivatives products. The pre-seed round for D8X includes additional participation from Axelar Network, Swissborg Ventures, Cogitent Ventures, Veris Ventures, G1 Ventures, Pragma Ventures, CryptoDiscover and others. “DeFi is reshaping the future of finance. Projects like D8X are building the infrastructure that will help legacy finance to leap into web3,” said Polygon Co-Founder Sandeep Nailwal. Bridging CeFi to DeFi D8X's founders bet on centralized players wanting to offer decentralized crypto derivatives to their clients without having to hire experts to develop in-house market-making and trading engines. D8X provides a white-label solution to partners who act as brokers and earn fees by running their own front ends powered by the D8X trade engine and shared liquidity.

Binance recently listed FDUSD, a 1:1 USD stablecoin on the BNB smart chain issued by Hong Kong-based licensed trust company, First Digital. With the new zero-fee trading program, users can buy and sell supported cryptocurrencies using FDUSD without paying transaction fees. Binance Introduces Zero-Fee Trading Program The zero-fee trading program is part of Binance’s efforts to increase trading volumes between stablecoin pairs. The company currently has a zero-fee bitcoin trading & BUSD zero maker fee promotion for supported stablecoins. With its latest move, Binance is adding FDUSD to the fray of supported stablecoins on both spot & margin trading pairs. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Says Spot ETF Approvals Have No Bearing On Bitcoin Strategy #Binance adds #BTC / $FDUSD and $ETH / $FDUSD trading pairs and updates the zero-fee Bitcoin Trading Program. Find out more ⤵️https://t.co/g6Elnd77d9 — Binance (@binance) August 3, 2023 Taker fees are paid when the trade order is executed, while maker fees are paid when users make limit orders. According to the announcement on its blog, starting August 8, users will be able to enjoy zero maker and taker fees on the BTC/FDUSD spot and margin trading pairs. Users will also enjoy zero maker fees on all FDUSD spot and margin trading pairs, but takers will continue to pay standard fees based on the existing trading structure. The Potential Impact On Prices Binance’s announcement to waive trading fees could significantly impact the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance wields a lot of influence over the crypto market. In the past, Binance’s fee reductions and zero-fee promotions have preceded price pumps and increases in trading volume for the included cryptocurrencies, even if they are only temporary. Bitcoin, on its own, seems to have found a footing just below $30,000, but the influx of new money and traders could support a higher price push for Bitcoin. The same goes for Ethereum, which is currently ranging around $1,800. BTC price could benefit from zero fees on Binance | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com With no trading fees, investors can also move money in and out of stablecoins freely to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities across exchanges or trade pairs.

During this time period, the BTC-TUSD pair on Binance alone exceeded $700 million in trading volume. It is unclear when the zero-fee trading promotion will end on the BTC/FDUSD and ETH/FDUSD trading pairs, but it is expected to increase the volume of FDUSD being traded on the exchange.

Gensler Pivoting Regulatory Eye To AI Under the leadership of its chairperson, the SEC has shifted its focus from cryptocurrency to artificial intelligence (AI), recognizing it as a technology that ""warrants the hype."" Gensler, who previously dealt with crypto industry scams and fraud, now views AI as the most transformative technology of this generation and warns of the risks it may pose if not properly regulated. Gensler emphasizes that mass automation driven by AI can have far-reaching implications for the trillions of dollars in assets traded on SEC-regulated markets.

Latest Prices  Top Stories  South Korea's Upbit surpassed centralized exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and OKX in spot trading volume for the first time in July, according to a report from CCData, making it the world’s second-largest crypto exchange after Binance. Coinbase’s volume dropped by 11.6% to $28.6 billion in July, and OKX’s fell 5.8% to $29 billion. Upbit bucked the general market trend with a 42.3% increase to $29.8 billion. The Korean market is being driven by demand for cryptocurrencies from retail investors.  Coinbase, the biggest publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange, announced that Base, its layer-2 blockchain built with Optimism's OP Stack, will open to the public next Wednesday. Base went live for developers in July so that they could test applications on the network. Users are now able to transfer their ether to Base, Coinbase wrote in a blog post. The Base announcement came ahead of Coinbase releasing its second-quarter results. Its revenue topped analysts' expectations, and its loss was narrower than expected.  ProShares and Bitwise have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an exchange-traded fund focused on bitcoin and ether.

42410052,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcS1a8,1691151264,Hong Kong's New Crypto License Could Cost Exchanges a Pretty Penny,"Tough requirements and high costs for applicants could weed out smaller companies.  Platforms are able to serve retail customers, which may give institutional investors more confidence to enter crypto markets.  Crypto exchanges may have to shell out as much as $20 million for an operating license in Hong Kong under the city's new regulatory regime, which came into effect in June.  The new licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms gives exchanges with a presence in the city one year to apply for fresh approval or leave.  So far, exchange platforms OSL and HashKey, who held licenses under the previous opt-in regime, have obtained received approval under the new regime, and are now allowed to serve retail investors.  However, three individuals familiar with but not allowed to speak publicly on the application process told CoinDesk that obtaining a new license could cost anywhere between $12 million and $20 million.  Their estimates took into account operating costs leading up to the license and payments for necessary vendors for the application itself, including consultants, lawyers and insurance providers.  OSL and HashKey are part of larger financial services groups and may have the funds to spare, but the cost of consideration under the new rules will be prohibitive for many firms.  Licensing consultants can charge up to $1 million to advise companies on the application, a person familiar with the matter said. Exchanges are required to maintain a paid-up share capital of 5 million Hong Kong dollars ($640,000), and liquid capital of at least $380,000. They must hold liquid assets equivalent to at least a year of operating expenses, not counting virtual assets.  Companies will have to invest in capabilities that ensure segregation of client funds, safe custody of assets, pay for smart contract audits and overall corporate governance. Before onboarding investors, firms will need to assess their knowledge of virtual assets.  Firms must also have a local presence with seed phrases and private keys (with backups) stored in Hong Kong. They must hire compliance officers known as licensed responsible officers (ROs), to make sure the business meets the regulatory requirements, and each applicant is required to have at least two ROs. ROs typically charge a premium for their services due to high demand.  “We will have this natural selection of players in the market,” Alessio Quaglini, CEO of Hex Trust, told CoinDesk. Hex Trust is planning to apply for a Hong Kong license for its own exchange HTX.  High benchmark  The announcement of a licensing regime has prompted a rush for applications but industry members know that not all will meet the regulator’s benchmark.  SOMA.finance Co-Founder Will Corkin said that small exchanges that might not have large trading volume or don’t have a track record of doing things the right way are “up for a pretty difficult battle” to get licensed.  Robert Zhan, KPMG China director of risk consulting, pointed out that only eight banks attained virtual bank licenses even though there were “a significant number of parties” interested.  Zhan explained that the Securities and Futures Commission has shared its “minimum criteria” for applicants. As well as meeting those requirements, applicants need to ensure they are “presenting the strongest possible case to support their application,” Zhan said.  China’s regulatory sandbox  Despite China’s ban on its own population trading virtual assets, Hong Kong’s residents have the implicit go-ahead. Conferences have started again in the city, with attendees flying in from Singapore and Dubai to see if Hong Kong is truly open.  “I’m sure that was not easy,” Stratford Finance CEO Angelina Kwan said, referring to Hong Kong getting approval to be China’s regulatory sandbox for digital assets. However, Hong Kong functions as a sort of testing ground for other forbidden activities on Mainland China. Hong Kong is home to international capital markets and allows betting on horse races (Chinese citizens cannot directly invest in overseas stocks and gambling is banned).  Meanwhile, the city’s leaders mentioned Web3 in the budget, formed a Web3 task force, and the government’s promotional arm, InvestHK, is present at almost every industry event. A local politician has invited exchanges globally to apply for licenses.  The hope is that once platforms begin to obtain licenses, investors can move fiat currency from banks onto trading platforms, trade in fairly liquid markets, and have exposure to virtual assets.  “People want to have the Securities and Futures Commission, regulatory bodies like that, behind them,” Corkin told CoinDesk.  “The 2017 days of opening up exchanges based out of small European countries doesn't really hold the same as it did back then,” Corkin said.  Holding licenses issued by a globally respected financial regulator means that licensed platforms are far more likely to meet internal standards of investment firms, thereby allowing for more capital to enter.  Allowing retail traders to use platforms may also give institutional investors confidence, since regulators tend to set the bar higher for retail investors to enter.  What’s allowed?  The biggest fanfare has been made about the regime’s allowing platforms to serve retail investors. Retail trading has been going on in Hong Kong in a gray area with investors turning to global exchange Binance and buying NFTs on OpenSea (the latter remains unregulated).  But derivatives, the largest money-maker for exchanges, are still off the cards. The regime will only permit investors to trade large-cap coins.  Tokens will need to be listed in two acceptable indices, and go through due diligence. They will need to have a one-year track record. The background of developers will be checked, as will supply, demand and liquidity.  No external custodians  Under the regime, platforms cannot choose external custodians. They must handle custody themselves. One of the heaviest requirements on platforms is that they must have insurance or compensation which covers the potential loss of 50% of client virtual assets held in cold storage.  Quaglini said that this cost will be borne by loss-making companies, or the end user who has the option of using offshore exchanges.  In his view, there should be a few credible institutions specialized in custody that can bear insurance costs. A few specialized players would mean they can operate a profitable business.  “It’s going to be very hard to create competitive players,” he said.  Kwan, who used to work for the Security and Futures Commission, explained the regulator’s requirement on exchanges handling their own custody as needing to know who to hold accountable. “It’s one throat to choke,” Kwan said, also pointing to potential security risks with connectivity.  Surrounding infrastructure  Since crypto exchanges are required to have ties to a bank in order to apply for the license, Hong Kong’s de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, has been holding roundtables inviting banks and virtual asset players to attend, the first in April and another in June.  Companies have found it difficult to maintain reliable banking relationships, with some fearing that even if they manage to open accounts, they may be closed down. Consultancies have been giving presentations to compliance teams in banks to bring them up to speed on what risks to look for.  Finding the right insurance and even a provider has also been an issue for applicants. Kwan said that some companies wrongly end up buying specie insurance rather than comprehensive coverage or fiduciary liability insurance.  Like the banks, insurance companies are also unsure about working with crypto.  Next up  Annie Hui, co-founder of digital asset security firm Custonomy said that she hopes that, as the guidelines are refined, that proof of solvency will be integrated into the regime. This would mean that platforms have in place mechanisms to prove that the total amount of assets held in custody is larger than the total amount of liabilities.  Stablecoins are not permitted so far. OKX global’s Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai said their unavailability for retail trading was a “temporary arrangement” and added he is “cautiously optimistic” that they will be made available, once the HKMA issues its conclusions on stablecoins. Whatever happens, it is clear that algorithmic stablecoins like the now defunct terraUSD will not be allowed.

42410062,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcS1qf,1691150847,"Coinbase Moves to Dismiss SEC Lawsuit, Alleging Crypto Falls Out of Regulator's Oversight","Coinbase (COIN) asked a judge to dismiss the Securities and Exchange Commission case against it, alleging the regulator is stepping well outside of its jurisdiction in suing the crypto exchange.  The SEC sued Coinbase in June, alleging the exchange violated federal securities laws by operating as an unregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency for cryptocurrencies that were securities, naming 13 tokens as examples of coins it believed met those requirements. Coinbase pushed back in a filing on Friday, saying the SEC isn't claiming there are investment contracts involved in any of these examples.  ""The transactions over Coinbase’s platform and Prime are not, and do not involve, contractual undertakings to deliver future value reflecting the income, profits, or assets of a business. They are commodity sales, with the obligations on both sides discharged entirely the moment the digital token is delivered in exchange for payment,"" the filing said.  The filing pointed to last month's ruling in the SEC's case against Ripple, saying the underlying facts were ""substantially identical to those alleged here."" A federal judge ruled that Ripple's programmatic sales — where it listed XRP on exchanges for anyone to purchase — weren't securities transactions, whereas Ripple's direct sales to institutional clients were.  Meanwhile, Coinbase said that SEC allegations that Coinbase's staking and wallet services violate securities laws should be dismissed for similar reasons.  Coinbase also pointed again to the ""Major Questions Doctrine,"" which it raised in a previous filing, saying the suit would vastly expand the regulator's jurisdiction to include the cryptocurrency industry.  Coinbase attached 10 different exhibits to its motion, including transcripts from a hearing in the SEC's case against LBRY and orders from previous cases involving Howey Test questions. The Howey Test is a standard set by the Supreme Court in 1946 that regulators can use to determine what constitutes an investment contract.  The SEC has until Oct. 3 to file a response to Coinbase's motion, and any amicus briefs supporting Coinbase can be filed until Aug. 11.  Coinbase signaled it would file to dismiss the lawsuit during an earnings call on Thursday.  Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said during the call that Coinbase believed it could win the case.  ""We expect to win. But it's important to understand that our goal across not just the litigation but all of our efforts engaging with the SEC and engaging with the U.S. government as a whole is to achieve regulatory clarity to protect consumers, promote innovation and essentially establish clear rules of the road that everyone can understand and follow,"" Grewal said.

GMX, the most popular decentralized exchange on the Arbitrum layer 2 network, allows users to trade spot and perpetual futures through an on-chain interface at low fees. Part of its recent popularity can be attributed to the rise of the Ethereum-based Arbitrum, where GMX was able to offer traders a service for betting on price movements of major tokens, such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), using leverage.  V2 will exist alongside the current GMX platform. It expands the list of tradable assets to include alternative currencies such as dogecoin (DOGE) at lower fees than version 1 in an effort to attract trading activity and drive revenue growth.  Liquidity on V2 is provided through individual GMX Market, or GM, pools. Liquidity providers are users who lock their tokens on GMX and are rewarded with a cut of fees earned from services such as leverage trading, borrowing and swaps.  Initial GM pools include solana (SOL), xrp (XRP), litecoin (LTC), dogecoin and arbitrum (ARB) on the Arbitrum network alonside SOL, XRP, LTC and DOGE on the Avalanche network.  A GM pool comprises long tokens, which back positions betting on higher prices, a short token, which bets on lower prices, and an index pool token.  As of Friday, GM pools for DOGE are paying out as much as 45% annualized, while the solana pool is paying 47%. The rates are subject to change.  The introduction of V2 could help GMX’s prospects among traders in an increasingly competitive market. Ultimately, attractive rewards and increased revenues could drive value to GMX’s namesake governance tokens gmx (GMX).  GMX locks up over $447 million on Arbitrum and $74 million on the Avalanche network, data from DefiLlama shows.

One of the recent moves involves the addition of 22 new loanable and collateral assets to its Flexible Loan and VIP Loan services, including the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu. This marks an essential milestone for Shiba Inu, intensifying the spotlight of the dog-themed meme coin. Shiba Inu Emerges As A Viable Collateral Asset Binance’s approval of Shiba Inu as a collateral asset is specifically noteworthy as it suggests that the crypto exchange is acknowledging Shiba Inu’s market potential and the growing trust in its liquidity. This could possibly pave the way for increased adoption of SHIB as a credible asset within the wider crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Related Reading: Whale Activity Spikes As Shiba Inu Preps For Shibarium Launch Simultaneously, the recent development has ignited conjecture about the possibility of Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) tokens being listed on Binance. This conjecture aligns with the eagerly-awaited roll-out of the layer 2 blockchain, Shibarium, slated for unveiling within the current month. Should this transpire, it could boost the visibility and credibility of both SHIB and BONE. Interestingly, Binance’s announcement on August 4 didn’t only involve Shiba Inu. Among other notable assets are Compound and Theta, representing the exchange’s commitment to continually broaden its offering to cater to diverse crypto investors. Implications For SHIB’s Future The potential implications for Shiba Inu following this announcement are profound. It is a significant indicator of the coin’s evolution from its meme origin to a legitimate financial asset within the crypto sphere. Particularly, the acceptance of SHIB as a collateral asset could attract serious investors, impacting its price and market cap in the long run. Further driving this speculation is Binance’s potential listing of the BONE token, dependent on the successful Shibarium mainnet launch. As previously disclosed by the lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, the Shibarium launch is expected in August, making BONE’s listing on Binance a distinct possibility. If actualized, this could further solidify Shiba Inu’s standing in the market, making it a coin worth watching in the crypto space. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s DeFi Aspirations May Rattle DOGE’s Market As SHIB Turns To Digital IDs To further showcase Shiba Inu’s seriousness in becoming more than a meme coin, Kusama reportedly disclosed the Shiba Inu project, Shibarium, will integrate Digital Identity Verification into all its future developments.

In this way, Shibarium is the herald of a new digital age where faith in systems is restored and enhanced.

Prominent malware includes the likes of RaccoonStealer, SmokeLoader, and Vidar, which hijack computers belonging to unsuspecting users for crypto mining or theft. BlackBerry Identifies Significant Threats The findings were published in a “Global Threat Intelligence Report” published on Thursday. In the report, the former smartphone giant states that they successfully averted over 1.5 million cyberattacks between the months of March and May. The company added that the primary target of these attacks was the healthcare, financial, and government sectors. BlackBerry published the report on X, stating, “Think only enterprises get hacked? If you’re a mid-market or small business, you still have a big target on your small or mid-size back. BlackBerry’s@aboutsecurity shares why cybercriminals select targets based on impact & how much they’re willing to pay.” One of the most significant threats identified during this period was RedLine, a commodity malware that can harvest information such as saved credentials, crypto, and credit card information. RedLine was used to breach Hatch Bank, a fintech banking platform, leading to the loss of significant banking data and crypto. BlackBerry noted in its report, “During this reporting period, BlackBerry telemetry observed a continuous trend in the use of commodity malware such as RedLine, which can harvest information including saved credentials, credit card information, and cryptocurrency.” Malware Targeting Crypto The company also identified several other malware families specifically designed to hijack and use computers for mining purposes. These include RaccoonStealer, Vidar, and SmokeLoader. SmokeLoader, a rogue financial tool, is of particular concern and has been used by Russian hackers and threat actors for rogue crypto mining. RaccoonStealer, a malware that can be sourced from the dark web, has been designed to specifically target crypto wallets and steal information. The malware is capable of obtaining passwords, cookies, web browser data, and cryptocurrency wallet data. Another malware, Vidar, targets Linux users and extracts information from crypto wallets and exchanges. Hackers routinely target Linux systems because they are vulnerable to mining attacks. BlackBerry has advised companies to apply security patches to secure themselves from attacks orchestrated by the malware families in question. “Vidar harvests banking information, browser credentials, and cryptocurrency wallets, as well as standard files.” The report also highlighted the Clop ransomware, which was used to target banking and financial institutions. This particular ransomware was also responsible for a data breach at Hatch Bank. The report also highlighted the growing threat to critical sectors from hackers and such malware, emphasizing the importance and urgency for companies to bolster their cybersecurity practices to counter these threats. Hackers have also introduced the Promotei botnet to target Linux-based servers to mine cryptocurrencies such as Monero. Given the botnet’s advanced features, tracing and stopping it has been notoriously difficult. The Crypto Space And Cybersecurity SonicWall, a cybersecurity firm, has, in a recent report, stated that crypto-jacking incidents have risen a staggering 399% year-on-year. Most of the entities behind these attempts are based in regions where mining bans and sanctions are in force. An estimate by Statista projects the cybersecurity market to reach $162 billion in 2023 on the back of increasing threats to the crypto ecosystem. The most recent hack targeting an exchange occurred on the 22nd of July when North Korean hackers from the notorious Lazarus Group targeted the Coinspaid exchange and stole around $37 million.

The platform said it took the ""difficult decision"" with its local banking partner to halt operations because of an ""evolving regulatory environment"" and ""uncertainties around the crypto market"" in the U.S. Regulators in the country, led by the Securities and Exchange Commission, have been cracking down on crypto, targeting exchange platforms like Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, as well as a host of individual tokens including Solana's SOL, Cardano's ADA and Polygon's MATIC, alleging violations of federal laws.  After the tokens were categorized as unregistered securities by the SEC in a lawsuit, several platforms including Robinhood and Revolut said they would end support for the tokens on U.S. platforms.  ""This decision has not been taken lightly, and we understand the disappointment this may cause.

15628930,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545765,1691145348,Bitcoin And Crypto Alert: The Implications Of Bill Ackman’s 30-Year T-Bills Short,"What does this mean for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market? In a surprising move that has sent ripples through the financial world, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman recently announced that he is shorting 30-year Treasury bills. Ackman predicts that yields could soon skyrocket to 5.5%, a move he is positioning as a hedge against the impact of long-term rates on stocks in a world he believes will be characterized by persistent 3% inflation. “I have been surprised how low US long-term rates have remained in light of structural changes that are likely to lead to higher levels of long-term inflation,” Ackman wrote on Twitter. He cited factors such as de-globalization, higher defense costs, the energy transition, growing entitlements, and the greater bargaining power of workers as potential drivers of this inflation. Ackman also pointed to the overbought nature of long-term Treasurys and the increasing supply of these securities due to the U.S.’s $32 trillion debt and large deficits. “When you couple new issuance with QT, it is hard to imagine how the market absorbs such a large increase in supply without materially higher rates,” he added. Remarkably, the 30 year yield climbed to 4.28% yesterday. However, not everyone agrees with Ackman’s perspective. Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of Lumida Wealth, suggested that Ackman’s views might already be priced into the market. “When someone has an idea, especially a hedge fund manager, it’s good mental habit to assume the idea is Consensus,” Ahluwalia wrote on Twitter. He even suggested taking the opposite view, advocating for buying 10-year bonds in the 4.1 to 4.25% range and mortgage bonds at 6.5 to 7%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Or Breakdown? Ark Invest’s David Puell Shares His Prediction Meanwhile, Lisa Abramowicz, a Bloomberg analyst, noted that the U.S. Treasury selloff has been driven by long-dated notes, not those most sensitive to Fed policy. “This suggests two things: traders expect inflation to stay higher for longer and they question whether the Fed is truly going to raise rates high enough to achieve 2% inflation,” she said. Implications For Bitcoin And The Crypto Market? Since the opinions are divergent and, moreover, Bitcoin and bond yields are linked in several ways, there are several potential scenarios. Scenario 1: Yields Rise Significantly If Bill Ackman’s prediction comes true and the yield on 30-year Treasury bills rises significantly to around 5.5%, this could have several implications for Bitcoin. Increased Risk Appetite: Higher bond yields could indicate a greater risk appetite among investors. If investors are willing to accept higher risk for higher returns, they might also be more inclined to invest in Bitcoin, which is often seen as a riskier asset. This could potentially drive up the price of Bitcoin. Inflation Hedge: If the rise in bond yields is driven by increased inflation expectations, Bitcoin could attract more investment as a potential store of value. Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘digital gold’, has been seen by some investors as a hedge against inflation. If inflation continues to rise and erodes the value of fiat currencies, more investors might turn to Bitcoin, pushing its price higher. However, that’s a narrative that still needs to be proven over time. Furthermore, it’s important to note that if yields rise too quickly or too high, it could lead to a sell-off in risk assets, including Bitcoin, as investors move to safer assets. This could potentially put downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Scenario 2: Yields Remain Stable Or Fall If, contrary to Ackman’s prediction, yields remain stable or fall, this could also impact Bitcoin. Risk Aversion: Lower yields could suggest that investors are moving towards safer assets, which could negatively impact Bitcoin prices. If investors are less willing to take on risk, they might move away from Bitcoin towards safer assets like bonds. Related Reading: DOJ Action Against Binance: A Hidden Blessing For Bitcoin And Crypto Markets? Liquidity Conditions: Bond yields can reflect liquidity conditions in the market. If yields fall, it could suggest that liquidity is high. In such a scenario, there could be more capital available for investment in assets like Bitcoin, potentially supporting its price. Scenario 3: Market Uncertainty Increases If market uncertainty increases, for example due to concerns about U.S. fiscal policy or rapid repricing in the bond market, Bitcoin could potentially serve as a hedge. Hedge Against Uncertainty: In times of market uncertainty, like in the banking crisis in March, some investors might turn to Bitcoin as a potential hedge. If Bitcoin’s perceived status as a ‘digital gold’ or safe haven asset strengthens, this could potentially attract more investment and drive up its price. However, it’s important to note that Bitcoin’s reaction to market uncertainty can be unpredictable and can depend on a variety of factors, including investor sentiment and broader market conditions. In conclusion, the potential impact of bond yield movements on Bitcoin’s price is complex and can depend on a variety of factors. Investors should remain vigilant and consider a range of potential scenarios. Otherwise, Bitcoin and crypto intrinsic factors like the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, a Ether futures ETF or any actions by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) against Binance, among others, have the potential to cause an increased volatility.

42410049,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcS1QD,1691144512,Largest Crypto Miners Will Benefit Most From Capacity Growth: Bernstein,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners are adding significant capacity, with the 16 largest publicly listed mining companies accounting for 16% of total BTC mined, broker Bernstein said in a research report Thursday.  Bernstein says their combined mining capacity is currently 72 exahashes per second (EH/s), and notes the firms are planning to increase that by 182% in the next 2-3 years.  “However, the larger miners with low cost of production and low debt are likely to be the big beneficiaries of capacity addition, with greater capacity to withstand any bitcoin price volatility and cost spike from upcoming bitcoin halving in Q1 2024,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  The bitcoin price is currently in the vicinity of $30,000, and 15 of the companies have production costs below $15,000 per BTC, the report said.  “With the upcoming halving, that would double the cost of production, and would push a few miners to break-even, assuming no price increase from here,” the analysts wrote.  Still, if the market sees positive momentum from bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF) approvals and increased institutional participation, that would give miners enough “margin room” for the 2024 halving, the note said, adding that the “lower the cost of production, better the miner positioning for the bitcoin halving impact.”  The broker notes that three of the miners have a debt-to-equity ratio of more than 1, which reduces their ability to withstand depressed bitcoin prices.  Four – Riot (RIOT), Marathon Digital (MARA), Hut 8 (HUT) and Hive Digital (HIVE) – hold bitcoin on their balance sheet.

While the measure is considered a proxy for institutional activity, it is vulnerable to labeling errors and subject to different interpretations.  The amount of bitcoin held in addresses tied to over-the-counter (OTC) desks, a proxy for institutional activity, has declined to the lowest level since June 15.  As of Thursday, the so-called OTC desk balance stood at 5,138 BTC, about $150 million at BTC's current market price of $29,225. That's a 33% slide from the one-year high of 7,697 BTC at the end of June, according to data tracked by Glassnode.  The tally surged by 156% in the first half as bitcoin's market value rose 84%, with some observers at the time referring to the climb as a bullish development. ""In our view, increased balances on OTC desks suggest that institutions and other large capital allocators are focused increasingly on bitcoin,"" Ark Investment Management's June report said.  Crypto investors, like their traditional market counterparts, can transact on an exchange or through an over-the-counter desk. The exchange acts as an intermediary between trading parties, matching orders. On an OTC desk, trades happen directly between the two parties, with one of them typically being the desk itself.  High-volume traders and institutions typically deal with OTC desks to avoid affecting the market price of the asset. For that reason, activity on OTC desks is said to reflect the behavior of large, sophisticated traders. In the past, some analysts have associated upticks and downticks in OTC desk balances with miners' intention to build/run down their coin stash.  That said, drawing definite conclusions from changes in the desk balances may be risky because they are exposed to address-labeling issues. Besides, the balance itself does not reflect whether the desk is accumulating or looking to liquidate coins on behalf of their clients.  ""BTC accumulation by OTC desks could mean that they are buying on behalf of clients OR it could mean that clients are passing their BTC to OTC desks to be sold,"" Noelle Acheson, the author of Crypto is Macro Now, newsletter told CoinDesk.

A US in turmoil not good for crypto With the US debt pile increasing rapidly from its current impossibly sized $32 trillion on which $1 trillion interest needs to be paid annually, and a government and its financial watchdogs trying their best to suppress and close down crypto companies, this cannot be the best jurisdiction to support the crypto industry. The US debt cannot be funded, and the Federal Reserve pushing up interest rates will only serve to close smaller businesses and put American people out of work. The crypto industry would create jobs, but it appears that this US administration does not want them. A recent downgrade of the US by the Fitch ratings agency would suggest that the cat is out of the bag and the craziness of US economic policy, and the ineptness of its government is being called to account. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, and obviously a staunch supporter of the US banking system, said of the downgrade: “It doesn’t really matter that much. The markets decide, not the rating agencies.” Mr Dimon might want to hope and pray that the markets carry on turning a blind eye to the house of cards that the US has become. Buying its own debt, and just being able to print more money doesn’t provide the solid base that its economy needs. Crypto exchanges worldwide tell an interesting story So where does this leave crypto? As per data from The Block, on North American exchanges for the month of July, a total of $42 billion in exchange volume was achieved. For exchanges based in Europe for the same month, the volume was $18 billion, and for those based in Asia it was a whopping $340 billion, which dwarfs that of both North America and Europe combined. These figures mean that the crypto trading market is only really happening in Asia, with around 8 times the volume of that taking place in North America. But what of China? Crypto trading has been banned here. So why, according to the Wall Street Journal, did Binance just do a monthly crypto trading volume of $90 billion in China? This volume also makes China the biggest contributor of trading volume to Binance worldwide. Either China has had a major rethink on crypto, or it just cannot suppress crypto within its own borders. But then if one looks to its overseas territory of Hong Kong, and how it is starting to give out licences to crypto companies and is setting itself up to be one of the major crypto hubs for Asia, it gives a bit more insight into the Chinese new thinking on crypto. The US is tearing itself apart with poor government and internal division, and is in the process of excluding a new and innovative technology from its shores.

15627149,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545763,1691141292,"Shiba Inu Price Poised To Reach $0.01 With Shibarium Upgrade, These CEOs Say","Shiba Inu (SHIB) is experiencing a remarkable surge in its upward movement, fueled by growing anticipation among meme coin enthusiasts for the upcoming introduction of Shibarium, an innovative upgrade to its layer 2 blockchain. Scheduled for release this August, Shibarium holds the key to addressing the prevailing scalability and network congestion issues that the Shiba Inu blockchain currently grapples with. Its primary objective is to propel the SHIB token to unprecedented success. Related Reading: Kaspa (KAS) Takes Off With 23% Burst – What’s Fueling The Thrust? While investors in Shiba Inu eagerly anticipate this significant milestone, a group of financial specialists has recently been consulted to offer their expert perspectives on how SHIB might respond following the successful implementation of the Shibarium upgrade. Shibarium’s Potential Impact On SHIB, According To Experts Jonathan Merry, CEO of Moneyzine.com, elucidated that Shibarium is a developer platform to revolutionize the accessibility of SHIB-related token transactions. Additionally, it will establish a central space for developers to forge and unveil their projects, Merry elaborated. Merry noted:. “In any case, as long as Shibarium is used, SHIB will profit. Suppose it is extremely successful and becomes a global sensation. In that case, SHIB may have a better chance of hitting the $0.01 target with the enhanced Shibarium and the new burn mechanism.” Ultimately, the potential realization of SHIB reaching $0.01 and the ascent of the BONE token price from $1 to $1,000 could be catalyzed by Shibarium, the executive suggested. SHIB market cap nearing the $5 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com Adam Garcia, CEO of The Stock Dork, delved into the significance of the forthcoming Shibarium upgrade, underscoring its role in mitigating the scalability and network congestion obstacles currently confronting the blockchain. Garcia said: “The expectation is that an improved and more efficient blockchain infrastructure could attract greater interest and adoption, thereby increasing the demand for the SHIB token.” He added that there is optimism that the token’s value could experience a substantial increase in the short term, especially as the network capabilities are upgraded and “supply-side pressures are reduced.” A Pivotal Juncture For Shiba Inu The analysis provided by these experts underscores the significance of the Shibarium upgrade for the SHIB token’s future. This juncture marks a technical evolution and a potential turning point in SHIB’s journey toward greater adoption and value appreciation. Related Reading: All Hype?

In its continued crackdown on crypto fraud, the SEC obtained a temporary asset freeze, restraining order, and other emergency relief against Digital Licensing Inc., a Draper, Utah-based entity operating as “DEBT Box.” The agency also acted against four of the company’s principals, Jason Anderson, his brother Jacob Anderson, Schad Brannon, and Roydon Nelson, along with 13 other defendants for their connecting to a scheme to sell crypto asset securities to US investors which raised around $50 million and an undisclosed amount of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

Getting listed on an established exchange like Bitmart, a significant player since 2017 that showcases an impressive roster of over 1500 cryptocurrency pairs, underscores a smart strategic play for the project. The main idea behind Shiba Memu’s AI was born out of the team's experiences with excessive marketing agency fees in previous business endeavors. This motivated them to take the initiative, developing a self-promoting AI that can scale into a variety of practical applications. The tangible concept, combined with the appealing Shiba Memu mascot, has fueled a wave of interest from investors and crypto enthusiasts who recognize the long-term potential of the project. Shiba Memu is currently priced at $0.0181, with a scheduled price increase every 24 hours, courtesy of the team's expertly programmed smart contract. This enticing mechanism is especially appealing to presale fans, as it guarantees the token purchase price will always be lower than the eventual exchange listing price. For example, if you bought today at $0.0181 the increase by the end of the presale on day 60 would be 35%. SHMU tokens are available to purchase on the official Shiba Memu website here. Why is Shiba Memu Trending? Shiba Memu's notable success can be attributed to the untapped potential of its AI. Still in its early stages, the AI employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis to scan the web, primarily focusing on social platforms, for Shiba Memu mentions and tailors its promotions accordingly. This has transformed the brand image from a simple cute dog meme to a funny and engaging dog meme with a sharp sense of humor! The glimpse into the project's future, and the forthcoming AI dashboards scheduled for Q4, are whetting investor appetite for meme coins with tangible utility. The project boasts a healthy outlook in its tokenomics, with 85% of tokens being dedicated to its presale, 10% to exchange listing liquidity and 5% to development - putting real power in the hands of SHMU owners in the future development of the dApp. Crypto Community Backing Is Driving Shiba Memu Engagement Through the Roof With more and more hard-hitting YouTubers getting involved with the project, it’s no wonder that global enthusiasm for the project is growing by the day. Prominent Youtuber NFTsGuide, with over 700K followers recently described the project as a ‘AI Marketing Powerhouse’, which again goes to show how the developers premise of building self-marketing tech is relatable to not only investors but crypto enthusiasts. Some have even speculated that Shiba Memu is in the running to dominate other memes, with Crypto Moonlight’s channel suggesting this could be an interesting opportunity for those who missed out on PEPE and others like Austin Hilton making some bold price predictions and calculations about how much SHMU investors would need to hold to hit significant ROI. The rapidity with which word has spread and the interest it’s gauged from seasoned hands like those above goes to show that the marketing tactics implemented so far are gaining serious traction - it will be interesting indeed to see how this one plays out. Now on day 32 of the presale which is scheduled to run for 60 days, at which time the price will have increased 119% from $0.011125 to $0.024400, Shiba Memu is truly racing ahead – time is running out for investors looking to get involved. About Shiba Memu Shiba Memu (SHMU) is a fresh dog-themed crypto meme coin that supports a platform utilizing AI to promote itself and generate buzz in online communities. This technology is poised to gain traction within the blockchain industry in the coming years, establishing Shiba Memu's position as an industry innovator.

What is a realistic price prediction following this decision, and what is it based on? Popular Twitter personality Shannon Thorp was recently asked to give a price prediction for XRP with no time frame or a set idea of circulating supply or the dollar amount it equates to. Thorp has noticed a trend among the XRP followers (the #XRPArmy as they are better known on Twitter) and found the camp to be divided. One side bases their future views and prediction based solely on charts, taking guidance from past price action and trends that Bitcoin – the biggest crypto by market cap, follows to determine short-term price predictions.

Whilst… — Shannon Thorp (@thorpshannon87) July 29, 2023 Thorp believes no side is correct since XRP does not constitute a security. In Ms Thorp's view, it is wrong to continue making price predictions for XRP as a ""security."" After the XRP ruling, the FedNow announcement and the US Congress passing its proposed crypto regulation bill to Senate, estimates of XRP's future price have come under question. Vahil Capital released a white paper on XRP's price, which indicates XRP's price could reach anywhere between $3,500 and $21,900. Vahil based its predictions on two years of research and six distinct quantitative models. The VC firm's prediction has been met with shock and scepticism, to say the least, and this apprehension is based on chart analysts stating the chart does not allow for such a prediction. Ms Thorp was quick to call out an issue with the charts: She argues that if a range for XRP is set at $1.00 - $5.00, what it ultimately means is that if one company owned all the XRP tokens in circulation, then yes, it would mean that that company in possession of all 100 billion tokens would have a Liquidity Strength of (LS) anywhere between $100B - $500B - bear in mind that is a burn rate for every transaction regardless of the amount. An LS such as this does not factor for economic growth, messaging and settling and does not account for the benefits of using XRP. Thorp explains the situation concerning SWIFT – SWIFT is one of the systems Ripple aims to improve on. As it stands, SWIFT handles 44.8 million messages in a day, does not include settlements, and at this point, is only half of what Ripple can do. Based on a $7 trillion value for SWIFT in a day (not 24/7 or 365). She suggests that if Ripple, in its ten years of innovation and partnerships, has only gained 30% of SWIFTs value, it would put XRP's daily value at $2.1 trillion (about 13.2 million messages). XRP settles in 1 -5 seconds, and the liquidity would be there. However, settlements are fast, but if a user were to send a $750 million transaction with an LS of $1.00, for argument's sake, it equates to 10% of all that bank's XRP. To determine a price prediction, Thorp follows the following logic: Considering all banks globally, all the XRP that has been burnt through other transactions, all the XRP tokens all its holder own, and all the XRP given to other large banks and the XRP tokens awarded to its creators. Then account for the XRP on liquidity hubs and exchanges and present an amount representing a range, using 50B-75B XRP at any one-time support LS. Then spread that across 300 -1000 banks, liquidity providers and governments. The math follows: 75 billion XRP at $1.00 amounts to $75 billion. Take $75B and divide by 1,000 banks equals $75 million XRP/dollars for each bank or liquidity provider. Further, assume big banks hold more XRP than small banks, and small banks would use liquidity providers. Then consider that Ripple has released all the XRP tokens to reach a circulating supply of 75 billion. LS would be $75M per bank, and a top-tier bank such as J.P. Morgan moves more than $8 trillion a day and considers service overlaps with SWIFT and the assumption that Ripple only has 10% of the market ($800 billion). This movement only accounts for cross-border transactions, not CBDCs, derivatives, real estate, NFTs and technical parallels. Vahil Capital's price prediction and logic do not seem so outrageous anymore. Thorp finally comes to her own price prediction. The Twitter personality has placed her prediction anywhere from $100 - $500 in the short term of four to seven months. She argues that it all comes down to LS if XRP is $100 at a supply of only 50 billion, which equates to an LS of $5 trillion and at $500 makes an LS of $25 trillion. The logic is that this gives the market room to grow and breathe and ensures that no one company needs to own billions of XRP tokens for day-to-day operation.

42410066,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcS2H7,1691135495,Cat Coin Toshi Purrs on New Base Blockchain,"A token named after Coinbase (COIN) founder and CEO Brian Armstrong’s cat is quickly emerging as a leading meme coin play on the upcoming Base blockchain, chatter among traders on social-media app X, formerly Twitter, shows.  Armstrong revealed his pet’s name in a podcast last year, saying the name was a derivation of pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. His other cat’s name is Mochi.  While it may sound ridiculous, traders are punting big money on toshi (TOSHI) tokens. Traders exchanged $10 million worth of the meme coins on a SushiSwap, a decentralized exchange on the Base network, in the past 24 hours and provided over $1 million in ether liquidity to the trading pair.  Some addresses bought over 8 ether (ETH), valued at $16,000 at current prices, worth of the tokens in a single transaction on Friday morning, data shows.  Such frenzy is likely driven by traders hoping to emulate the rise of dogecoin (DOGE) or shiba inu (SHIB) — two popular tokens themed after the Shiba Inu dog breed – in recent years.  “Meme coins are a hyper-speculative and volatile class of crypto tokens. Generally, these coins lack practical uses compared to more established tokens like ETH,” Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of crypto exchange BTSE, shared in a Telegram message. “That said, each investor has their own risk appetite, and these swings in volatility do offer excellent opportunities to lock in profits as well.”  Base, which is built by crypto exchange Coinbase on OP Stack, went live for developers earlier in July so that they could test applications and blockchain-based products before a planned launch later this year. It is scheduled to officially go live next Wednesday.  But the issuance of viral meme coin bald (BALD) last week saw traders jump in ahead of the official launch in the search for outsized returns, sending over $66 million via a one-way bridge to Base blockchain.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/04/toshi-emerges-as-key-meme-coin-play-among-traders-on-coinbases-base-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90a52243af644b90d6fcfb7bb2ddf4d8b05abb0f-7757x3660.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15623895,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545741,1691133645,Bitcoin Breakout Or Breakdown? Ark Invest’s David Puell Shares His Prediction,"David Puell, an on-chain researcher at Ark Invest, today shared his insights in a detailed report, offering a nuanced perspective on Bitcoin’s current standing and future prospects. The report, titled “The Bitcoin Monthly: July 2023,” addresses several key topics that are central to understanding the current state of Bitcoin. These topics include a comprehensive market summary, an analysis of Bitcoin’s low volatility and whether it indicates a potential breakdown or breakout, as well as a discussion on the impact of the Federal Reserve’s tightening policy as a leading indicator of price deflation. Ark Invest’s Near-Term Bitcoin Price Prediction Puell’s analysis reveals a mixed, but mainly bullish outlook for Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency ending July at $29,230, above its 200-week moving average and its short-term-holder (STH) cost basis of $28,328. This suggests a strong support level for Bitcoin, indicating a potential upward trend, notes Puell. However, Bitcoin’s 90-day volatility, which dropped to 36% in July, a level not seen since January 2017, presents a neutral outlook. Puell explains, “Based on its low level of volatility, we believe the Bitcoin price could be setting up to move dramatically in one direction or the other during the next few months.” This could mean a significant price movement, but the direction – up or down – is uncertain. Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Says Spot ETF Approvals Have No Bearing On Bitcoin Strategy Puell also points to signs of miner capitulation as a bullish indicator. “During July, the 30-day moving average of Bitcoin’s hash rate dropped below its 60-day moving average, suggesting that miner activity had capitulated,” he states. Miner capitulation is typically associated with oversold conditions in BTC price, hinting at a potential bullish reversal. The “liveliness” metric, which measures potential selling pressure relative to current holding behavior, also suggests a bullish trend. The analyst notes, “In July, liveliness dropped below 60%, suggesting the strongest long-term holding behavior since the last quarter of 2020.” This indicates that more holders are keeping their coins rather than selling them, which could drive the price up. ARK’s own short-term-holder profit/loss ratio, which ended July at ~1, is also seen as a bullish sign. Puell explains, “This breakeven level correlates both with local bottoms during primary bull markets and with local tops during bear market environments.” However, the future of Binance’s BNB token, which is facing increased regulatory pressure, looks bearish according to Puell. He warns, “As regulatory pressure increases on crypto exchange Binance, its native token, BNB, could be on the threshold of significant turbulence.” If BNB breaks down, it could potentially impact the overall stability of the crypto market, including BTC. Macro Outlook On the macroeconomic front, Puell discusses the potential impact of the Fed’s 22-fold increase in interest rates, which he views as bearish for Bitcoin and the broader economy. He states, “According to renowned economist Milton Friedman, monetary policy works with ‘long and variable lags’ that last 12-18 months, suggesting that the full impact of the Fed’s 22-fold increase in interest rates has yet to hit.” Related Reading: DOJ Action Against Binance: A Hidden Blessing For Bitcoin And Crypto Markets? The Zillow Rent Index, which leads the Owners’ Equivalent Rent (OER) by roughly nine months, suggests that Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation could decelerate significantly below 2% by year-end. Puell views this as a bullish sign for Bitcoin, as it could potentially increase the attractiveness of non-inflationary assets like Bitcoin. Lastly, Ark Invest takes a neutral stance on the falling US import prices from China, despite the yuan’s depreciation by ~12% since February 2022. He notes, “All else equal, China exporters should have increased prices to offset the depreciation of the yuan. Instead, they have cut prices, harming their profitability.” In conclusion, Puell’s report presents a complex picture for Bitcoin. While there are a lot of signs for a potential bullish trend, there are also significant risks and uncertainties that could lead to bearish outcomes. At press time, the BTC price was at $29.152. The most crucial resistance at the moment lies at $29.450. If BTC can overcome this resistance, a breakout from the multi-week downtrend might be possible.

The exploit resulted in a loss of around $70 million worth of crypto assets, meaning the bounty offered is around $7 million. A Resolution In Sight? The DeFi platforms impacted by the Curve heist are doing everything they can to recover the stolen funds. According to on-chain data, Curve, Alchemix, and Metronome have offered the hackers a 10% bounty as a reward, urging the hackers to return the remaining 90% of the stolen funds. Curve Finance updated users about their offer to the hackers via X, stressing that they would face no further legal or law enforcement actions if they chose to return the funds. Curve stated in the joint message sent via Etherscan, “The offer comes with a guarantee of no further legal actions or involvement of law enforcement. We want to resolve this in a civilized manner. You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues.” Final Warning The three protocols gave the hackers a deadline of 6th August to accept their offer. They added that should the hackers refuse the offer; the protocols would expand the bounty to the public and offer the 10% to anyone who would be able to identify them in a way that leads to their conviction. The stark warning read, “If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by 6th August at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law.” All three protocols have opened a direct line of communication with the hackers through curvenegotiation@protonmail.com and urged the hackers to respond and take the offer to avoid legal action. The protocols also stressed that any individuals responding for negotiations would need to verify their credentials and ownership of their email address on-chain. Curve and the other protocol’s outreach is similar to the strategy adopted by DeFi protocol Euler Finance, which fell victim to a crippling hack earlier in the year. However, the protocol was able to negotiate with the hackers and retrieve the stolen funds successfully. The Curve Hack The Curve exploit saw around $70 million worth of crypto stolen by hackers. This figure included CRV tokens worth around $4.52 million, which led to a significant drop in the price of the token. At the heart of the exploit was a vulnerability in Vyper called a reentrancy bug. This vulnerability allowed hackers to drain several stablecoin pools on Curve, leading to considerable chaos in the DeFi ecosystem. DeFi markets were further spooked after reports emerged that Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov had allegedly taken several loans using around 47% of CRV’s circulating supply. Several DeFi protocols, such as Aave, Abracadabra, and several others, faced major implications following the drop in CRV’s value. This is because the decline put Egorov’s $168 million lending position at risk of liquidation, potentially unleashing a domino effect on DeFi. However, Curve and Egorov found support from prominent names in the crypto and DeFi space, such as Power DeFi user DCF God, Tron Foundation CEO Justin Sun, and Jeffrey Huang, also known as Machi Big Brother. Sun, DCF God, and Huang purchased large quantities of CRV from Egorov, helping reduce the principal value of Egorov’s loan from $63 million to $54 million. Other players who assisted Egorov were Cream Finance, which sent Egorov $1 million worth of USDT and USDC, and Huang, who sent Egorov $1.5 million worth of USDT.

Trading activity rose 24% to $940 million, registering the first increase in four months, according to data tracked by CCData. Volume in bitcoin (BTC) options rose 16.6% to $734 million, while ether (ETH) options registered a 60% increase to $207 million.  ""The increase in BTC options volume on the CME suggests that institutions might be hedging their positions with options as uncertainty remains in the market,"" CCData said in a report shared with CoinDesk.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy and a put option confers the right to sell.  CME's options give the buyer of the call/put the right to buy/sell one cryptocurrency futures contract at a specific price at some future date. CME offers bitcoin and ether options based on the exchange's cash-settled standard and micro BTC and ETH futures contracts. Standard contracts are sized at 5 BTC and 50 ETH. The micro ones are one-tenth of 1 BTC and one-tenth of 1 ETH.  Bitcoin and ether each fell by 4% in July as optimism from the potential launch of a bitcoin-spot exchange-traded fund faded and regulatory uncertainty and decentralized-finance hacks roiled sentiment. Bitcoin traded alongside stocks and gold a little more than it did in the second half of June, warranting the use of options to hedge directional exposure in the crypto market.  The combined activity in CME BTC and ETH futures cooled in line with the global slowdown. Futures volume on CME registered a 17.6% decline to $39.1 billion, while total derivatives trading volume (futures and options) fell 17.0% to $40.1 billion, according to CCData.  The combined crypto spot and derivatives trading volume on centralized exchanges fell 12% in July to $2.36 trillion.

The filing, the second from the Justice Department and the third in the back-and-forth between Bankman-Fried's attorneys and the prosecutors accusing Bankman-Fried of massive financial fraud, presents the department's view that Bankman-Fried went far beyond making a ""fair comment"" in sharing the diary, which his team conceded both during a court hearing last Wednesday and in a filing earlier this week.  ""The record here establishes that the defendant went beyond benignly exercising a constitutional right to speak to the press — he took covert steps intended to improperly discredit a trial witness and taint the jury pool,"" the filing said.  The Justice Department said in its first filing last Friday that Bankman-Fried's conduct, which included his use of a virtual private network to watch the Super Bowl (according to the defense), his reaching out to FTX.US General Counsel Ryne Miller and now his sharing of Ellison's diary with the Times shows that he ""repeatedly ... seeks to corruptly influence witnesses,"" an argument prosecutors reiterated in Thursday's filing.  Read more: Is Sam Bankman-Fried Going to Jail?  In their response to the first filing from the Justice Department, Bankman-Fried's attorneys said the government had been ""mischaracterizing"" the FTX founder's actions to paint him in a negative light.  The former exchange CEO had merely sought to defend his reputation to the press and didn't initially reach out to Miller, the filing on Tuesday said.  In Thursday's filing, the Justice Department suggested that the defense team was itself mischaracterizing these actions.  According to the Justice Department, Bankman-Fried had originally set up groups on the Signal messaging app and set them to delete messages after a week.  Prosecutors also claimed that Bankman-Fried had helped create a ""media atmosphere"" that amplified Ellison's prominence ahead of her serving as a witness.  The Justice Department filing went so far as to say that Bankman-Fried may have himself let the New York Times know about Ellison's diary prior to sharing those documents with the news outlet.  ""What is clear — regardless of whether the defendant was the first source for stories regarding Ellison — is that the defendant, rather than deny his guilt as he correctly now says it is his right to do, shared materials with the press obviously designed to intimidate, harass, and embarrass someone he knows is slated to testify against him, and to provoke an emotional response in potential jurors and color a potential juror’s view of that witness,"" the filing said.  The filing also contains a footnote commenting on the defense team's repeated mentions of current FTX CEO John J. Ray III, who took over to navigate FTX's bankruptcy.  ""It is notable just how much of the defendant’s various letters focus on his interactions with or perceptions of John Ray, an individual who is not a witness in this case and whose communications have no relevance to any issue at stake here,"" the filing said. ""The defendant’s arguments should be seen for what they are: an attempt to deflect from his own conduct by pointing at another person whom the defendant apparently views in a negative light.""  Judge Lewis Kaplan, the Southern District of New York judge overseeing the case, may schedule another hearing to discuss the filings.  Kenneth White, a former federal prosecutor and a founding partner at Brown White & Osborn, previously told CoinDesk that the Justice Department would have to convince the judge that Bankman-Fried is a danger to the community. Harassing or intimidating a witness would fall under a subset of that concern.  ""If the DOJ could convince the judge that Bankman-Fried isn't going to obey judicial orders, and he's going to keep trying to harass and abuse his ex, retaliate against her for testifying, try to influence her to not testify and so forth, then that would be a basis for the judge to decide that he's going to jail,"" White said.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/04/sam-bankman-fried-likely-faces-jail-as-doj-pushes-for-incarceration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c356d26e20e9407badc86a892007c20d246892ae-4155x2338.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

When writing on August 3, CRV is trading at $0.59, rising double digits after dropping to $0.48 on August 1 following a damaging hack that saw liquidity providers in several pools lose funds. Whales Stepping In To Buy CRV This recovery is attributed primarily to strategic actions by notable crypto whales who have stepped in to mitigate risks on DeFi should CRV prices continue to tank. Meanwhile, Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve and one of the largest CRV holders, has been actively unloading tokens in the secondary market. Egorov is selling to whales like Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, and other venture capitals and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The founder held around 292 million CRV and used a big percentage to back his loans. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s DeFi Aspirations May Rattle DOGE’s Market As SHIB Turns To Digital IDs On-chain data indicates that on August 2, Egorov sold 3.75 million CRV tokens to Yearn Treasury and another 1.25 million CRV tokens to Stake DAO Governance via the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Egorov has, overall, sold 59.5 million CRV to various institutions and investors, yielding approximately $23.8 million. These OTC sales are at significant discounts, reflecting the founder’s efforts to stabilize CRV prices and prevent further contagion. The July 30 hack saw attackers steal funds from several liquidity pools after exploiting a re-entrancy flaw. JPEG’d, Alchemix, Pendle, and Metronome pools suffered losses initially estimated at around $70 million. However, other reports suggest that white hat hackers intervened, reducing the total impact to approximately $50 million. Following this news, CRV prices dropped by over 12%. Considering Curve’s prominence in DeFi, the hack and price crash caused reverberation throughout Curve and DeFi, especially in decentralized money markets. Curve Is A Big Player In DeFi, Egorov Paying Off Debt Curve manages over $2 billion as total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. While there are no confirmed repercussions on other protocols, attention swung to Egorov’s $60 million Aave v2 loan, which was primarily backed by CRV. Should this loan be liquidated, it would likely mean more selling pressure on CRV, leading to another possible contagion, especially for other CRV holders with loans across different protocols. Related Reading: Solana Price Could Surge To $30 Upon Overcoming This Resistance Looking at on-chain data, Egorov is taking active steps to reduce the risks brought about by his huge Aave loan that’s overly collateralized by CRV. Egorov aims to minimize the potential consequences of forced liquidation through off-market transactions, where he is selling his CRV at a discount and simultaneously repaying his loan. This, in turn, appears to be supporting prices.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Is More Volatility in the Offing?  Is bitcoin's current lull just a set-up for more dramatic movements to come?  A report by K33 earlier this week suggested as much. The digital-asset analytics group noted that while the largest cryptocurrency has been recently trading in an increasingly narrow spread over the last six weeks immune to macroeconomic and industry events, which likely would have stimulated investors up or down in past years, it was headed for more volatile times based on historical precedent.  As TradFi markets in Asia opened Friday, bitcoin was changing hands at just below $29,200, flat over the past 24 hours and firmly in the $500 range it has occupied for the better part of two weeks. And bitcoin has failed to cross $31,000 since mid-July.  “A deep crypto sleep tends to be followed by a violent wake-up,” K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde wrote. “The market is clearly in an unprecedented stable stage, which has typically acted as a massive pressure valve for volatility once it finally reignites.”  “My short-term thesis,"" he continued, ""is that the market’s volatility pressure is about to climax and that an eruption is near.""  Ether, which has been similarly range-bound, was recently trading at $1,835, a 0.2% decline from Thursday, same time. Ripple's XRP token and ADA, the native crypto of smart-contracts platform Cardano, pared earlier losses but were still down about 2% in a market that retained a more than day-long reddish tint. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of cryptos' performance, was recently down 0.35%.  At least cryptos found some companionship, as equity markets, which have increasingly veered in a separate direction from digital assets, closed down with the S&P 500 off 0.3%.  According to K33 Research, bitcoin's five-day volatility earlier this week had sunk to below that of the S&P, gold and the Nasdaq 100. That has happened only a few times in recent years, Lunde pointed out, and every occasion preceded periods of wild price swings.  The report also noted that bitcoin’s 30-day volatility, which measures average price changes over the period, recently dropped to near a five-year low. At the same time, trading volumes also shrunk to multiyear lows, while derivatives activity has also declined sharply.  In her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter on Friday, Noelle Acheson (CoinDesk's former head of research) called crypto markets' recent monotony even as significant events swirled ""bewildering,"" but quipped: ""I’ve been covering this market long enough to be able to confirm that, anecdotally, whenever we start joking about BTC being a stablecoin, things turn fast.""  Insights  Is 'Hodling' Starting to Wane?  The total supply of bitcoin last active more than one year ago has declined recently according to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. The decrease indicates that some longer-term holders have decided to reduce their holdings.  An increased supply of an asset active in the past indicates that more investors have decided to “hodl” bitcoin as opposed to taking profits. A decrease in that amount indicates the opposite.  The primary age band where supply declined lies between 12 and 24 months. A slight decline in bitcoin supply is showing in the age band between five and seven years as well, though its general direction has been higher.  Investors may want to monitor the behavior of long-term bitcoin holders, as a signal of potential shifts in sentiment.

15613951,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545724,1691110838,Curve Finance Fights Back With Warning And Unrefusable Offer To Hacker,"Curve Finance (CRV) has issued a statement on Etherscan, addressing the hackers responsible for the recent exploit that resulted in the loss of over $60 million from the protocol. In the statement, Curve, Metronome & Alchemix have invited the hackers to discuss a potential bounty, offering a 10% reward for any stolen funds, which they can keep if they return the remaining 90%. Curve Finance Gives Hackers Ultimatum The group has emphasized that there will be no risk of them pursuing legal action or involving law enforcement if the hackers participate in this voluntary return process. However, suppose the hackers do not participate and complete the process by August 6. In that case, Curve Finance will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% reward to anyone who can identify them in a way that leads to their conviction in court. The encrypted message on Etherscan further noted: If you choose not to participate in the voluntary return and complete the process by August 6, we will expand the bounty to the public, and offer the full 10% to the person who can identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law. To verify their ownership of the email address, anyone emailing Curve Finance will have to complete a verification process on-cain before any discussions occur.

By offering a bounty and encouraging the hackers to return the funds voluntarily, Curve Finance is proactively resolving the situation. However, the group has also clarified that they will pursue all legal avenues to recover the funds if the hackers choose not to cooperate. It remains to be seen whether the hackers will take Curve Finance up on their offer or whether the group will need to expand the bounty to the public. Nevertheless, this statement demonstrates Curve Finance’s determination to protect the protocol and its users and sends a strong message to would-be attackers that such actions will not be tolerated. Aave DAO Member Suggests Tactical Move To Acquire CRV An Aave Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) member has proposed a strategic move to acquire CRV tokens using USDT from the Aave DAO treasury. Recent events surrounding Aave V2 have provided an opportunity to incentivize GHO liquidity through Curve voting power. The proposed acquisition of CRV tokens will benefit the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem by providing additional liquidity to the Curve protocol. Additionally, the move will position Aave DAO to benefit from the ongoing “Curve wars” and gain extra voting power on the platform. The Aave DAO member who proposed the move emphasized the importance of taking a strategic approach to treasury management. By acquiring CRV tokens with USDT, Aave DAO can maintain a conservative approach to treasury holdings while still supporting the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Binance CEO Shares Details Of $20 Million Scam Attempt The proposal has received positive feedback from the community, with many members expressing support for the move. If the proposal is approved, it will be a significant step forward for Aave DAO and the broader DeFi ecosystem. Overall, this proposal demonstrates the importance of strategic treasury management in the fast-paced world of DeFi. By taking a conservative approach to treasury holdings while still supporting the ecosystem’s growth, Aave DAO is setting an example for other DeFi projects to follow. Despite the ongoing issues experienced by the Curve protocol, CRV has reported significant gains of over 4% in the last 24 hours, with the current trading price at $0.602.
