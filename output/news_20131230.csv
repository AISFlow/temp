42397342,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfNz,1388416251,The Reserve Bank of India Has No Plans to Regulate Bitcoin,"Last week the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a public notice warning users to stay away from digital currencies.  It made it clear that Indian bitcoin exchanges lack the regulatory approval needed to exchange digital currencies for rupees and other national currencies. Local exchanges were quick to suspend operations, but that was not enough.  Within 48 hours of the RBI notice, India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided at least two bitcoin exchanges, buysellbitco.in and rbi.rbit.co.in, owned by Nilam Doctor. Investigators questioned the owners of both sites in an effort to ascertain whether any transactions carried out on their platforms violated the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Foreign Exchange Management Act.  For the time being, the owners of the platforms are not in custody and they do not appear to be facing any criminal charges. This may be indicative of another problem – even Indian regulators do not know what to do and even if they do, they lack a clear regulatory framework for digital currencies.  RBI's reluctancy  According to the Times of India, the RBI does not even plan to develop a regulatory framework for digital currencies. Therefore, at this moment in time, bitcoin platforms based in India simply cannot get regulatory approval. Additionally, it seems that this situation is not set to change anytime soon.  ""Regulation comes only when people are doing certain business and we come to understand that something wrong is happening,” RBI deputy governor KC Chakrabarty told a gathering of Indian entrepreneurs on Saturday.  “First of all, we don't understand this subject.”  The limits of the legal system  Chakrabarty stressed that the RBI does not regulate nor support digital currencies. He was keen to point out that bitcoin regulation has not been enacted anywhere else in the world, and that people who understand the risks are free to do whatever they like with their money.  ""Whether it is ... legal or illegal, we don't know,” he said bluntly. “If it crosses the limit of legality then people may face a problem. So people should be cautious.”  Chakrabarty’s statements are unusually candid, and illustrate a wider problem for financial authorities. Regulators simply cannot deal with digital currencies as they have to operate within the existing legal framework, which does not contain the provisions needed to regulate such currencies.  Furthermore, he seems to imply that regulating digital currencies is not RBI’s job to begin with. Hence, it is understandable why the RBI does not plan to assist in the development of a new regulatory framework for digital currencies.  In essence, the executive branch and national regulators have their hands tied, they cannot take any meaningful, constructive action without new legislation and there is simply no political will to deal with the issue.  They can, however, try to apply existing foreign currency legislation to bitcoin operators, which effectively renders their activities illegal.

42397331,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfDA,1388402738,Lamassu Announces Sale of 100th Bitcoin ATM,"Manufacturer Lamassu is ending 2013 on a high. The company has just announced the sale of its 100th bitcoin ATM, and more than 120 orders.  To mark the occasion, Lamassu has set up an online map of bitcoin ATM locations that will be updated as new units go live across the globe.  More than a dozen ATMs have been delivered so far, and the rest of the orders will be fulfilled by Spring 2014. Zach Harvey, Lamassu's CEO, said:  “We’ve had orders from all over the world. We will be shipping to 25 different countries, ranging from Canada to Kyrgyzstan. We've translated our user interface into more than a dozen languages including Russian, Chinese and Friulian. To me it’s a testament to the global reach of bitcoin.”  Lamassu started taking pre-orders for its first bitcoin ATM in August at a price of $5,000 per unit. The ATM has a relatively small footprint, it can process fiat to bitcoin transactions in under fifteen seconds and it accepts notes from more than 200 countries. More importantly, it is one of just a few practical bitcoin ATMs available today.  Earlier this month, Finnish company Bittiraha.fi installed the first permanent Lamassu ATM inside a Helsinki record store. Although bitcoin ATMs have popped up in several European cities before the Finns got their first unit, none of these were permanent installations.  Harvey said it is always exciting for a young startup to watch its sales ramp up, but the really thrilling part of the story is that these ATMs should provide millions of people with effortless access to bitcoin every day.  But with just a hundred units out there, it might take a while before you see a Lamassu bitcoin ATM in your neighbourhood.  Lamassu will demonstrate its ATM at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next Sunday. The company expects additional machines to be set up throughout Europe and the Americas over the next few weeks at some major cities, including: San Francisco, Atlanta and Seattle.

42397345,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfRv,1388396813,Six Places You Can Pay Bitcoin For Beer,"The holiday season usually involves plenty of social events and family get-togethers, and they all tend to involve drinking, or heavy drinking if you happen to have one of those black sheep uncles who show up once a year to ruin things for everyone else.  This year drunken uncles all over the world will be able to pay for a few pints using nothing but bitcoin. However, it is not as easy as it seems and the choice remains limited. There are still relatively few establishments that accept bitcoin payments. We were hoping to do a feature on bitcoin beer on five continents, but sadly we came up short.  1. Old Fitzroy, Sydney  The land of Fosters and Holdens has a bitcoin pub and as a result the whole gets a thumbs-up from bitcoin beer lovers. Aussies have the Old Fitzroy of Sydney to thank for getting on the list. The Old Fitzroy is a very traditional pub, but it also happens to be the only pub in Australia to accept bitcoin, or at least the only one we know of.    The bitcoin push was launched in late September, with an event dubbed ‘Beer for Bitcoins’. Also we would like to point out that Fosters and Holdens are a very bad combination, so please drink responsibly.    2. 2nd Place, Beijing  Moving north, if you happen to be doing business in the Glorious People’s Republic of China, you can grab a bitcoin beer at Beijing’s Cafe Bar 2nd Place. It is a small but stylish spot located in Beijing’s Wudaokou neighbourhood, some 10km from the city centre.  Although this might a bit too far from the bustle of downtown, bear in mind that we are talking about Beijing, so Wudaokou is bigger than many European capitals and it is home to several universities and research institutes. As a result it also has plenty of bars and nightclubs for students and geeks, including China’s first bitcoin bar.  3. Killfish bars, Russia  If you’ve already had enough beer, perhaps it is time to reset with a shot of vodka, or three. Russian bar franchise Killfish recently started accepting bitcoin and it is hands down the biggest provider of bitcoin booze at the moment.  The franchise has bars in 25 Russian cities, from posh St. Petersburg and downtown Moscow to the industrial city of Chelyabinsk, which was practically constructed from scratch to build thousands of T-34 tanks, causing much dismay to a certain failed painter from Austria. The city also has a nasty habit of attracting meteorites, leading locals to joke about their tank city being so tough that it actually rains meteorites.  The Killfish franchise is still expanding and it is known for aggressive marketing backed by cheap booze and food.  4. EMG Faktors, the Netherlands  The Chelyabinsk tanks made it all the way to Germany, but they did not venture into the Netherlands, which means there are no Killfish bars there. Luckily EMG Faktors in Groningen is accepting bitcoins, using the NUVOPOS system developed by Dutch company Bitcoin Cafe specifically for the hospitality industry.  Many readers are probably wondering whether it is possible to buy something else with bitcoin in the Netherlands, but as far as we could tell EMG Faktors is not that sort of coffee shop. It remains to be seen whether NUVOPOS will gain more traction in the Netherlands and the rest of Europe for that matter.  5. The Pembury Tavern, London  Brits still love their traditional pubs and technology, so it is hardly surprising that Individual Pubs Ltd has decided to embrace bitcoin in five of its pubs: the Coalheavers Arms in Peterborough, the Pembury Tavern in East London, the White Lion in Norwich, the Devonshire Arms in Cambridge and the Haymakers, also in Cambridge.  Individual Pubs owner Stephen Early does not describe himself as a bitcoin evangelist, but he believes the digital currency has a lot of potential and it allows business owners to offer services that are out of reach of traditional credit cards. Unsurprisingly he is a former computer scientist from the University of Cambridge.  6. Numerous bars in the US  The phrase ""there’s no such thing as a free lunch"" originated in America, but at one point it was simply not true. During the heyday of American saloons, long before the temperance movement managed to enact the disastrous 21st Amendment, many saloons were indeed offering a free lunch to all patrons. They simply gave them salty crackers and similar foods and made their money selling beer to salt laden saloon goers.  Things have moved on since then, but American barkeeps are as innovative as ever and a few of them have started accepting bitcoin to lure more customers.  A Baltimore bar started accepting bitcoin recently. The Bad Decisions bar in Fells Point allows patrons to pay for their tab in bitcoin. It also happens to be aptly named for anyone who entered the bitcoin market a few weeks ago, hoping for a huge return.  Earlier this year the EVR Bar in Manhattan started accepting bitcoin, which is hardly surprising since it is co-owned by Charlie Shrem, CEO of BitInstant.com.  It should be noted that BitInstant suspended services in July this year after receiving numerous complaints from customers who claimed their transactions were delayed, or that they never received their bitcoin. BitInstant got a $1.5m investment from the Winklevoss twins to scale up and improve services, but at this point it is unclear what its ultimate fate will be.  As always, CoinDesk advises you to drink (and invest) responsibly. Bitburger is in no way affiliated with bitcoin, but aside from having a fitting name it also happens to be a decent German beer.

42397339,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfL2,1388384412,"'Voluntarily Homeless' Man Lives Off Bitcoin, Android Tablet and a Solar Charger","A nomadic man in Spain is living off bitcoin, an Android tablet and a solar charger. The man, who wanted to be known only by his first name, Justas, is documenting his eighth year of homelessness, which he stresses is a deliberate choice, on reddit, YouTube and at his website.  When contacted by CoinDesk, 27-year-old Justas said bitcoin has overcome a major obstacle to his nomadic way of life: the ability to open a bank account.  [post-quote]  The two most common ways of obtaining bitcoin are to trade it for fiat currency through an exchange, or to mine it with increasingly powerful computers. Both these methods present problems for someone without a permanent address.  When asked how he had obtained his bitcoin, Justas said he was paid in the cryptocurrency for freelance work as a programmer and designer.  Justas said his technology requirements are fulfilled by a Toshiba laptop and bq Curie tablet, which runs Android Jelly Bean.  He keeps his devices powered up with a portable solar charger. He said he bought his tablet with bitcoin and pays for his website's hosting and domain registration services with the digital currency as well.  Justas has been publicly documenting his travels on r/Bitcoin, YouTube, his blog and Twitter. The thread he started on r/Bitcoin, where he posts as PureApeshit, has attracted more than 200 comments.  Redditors have even tipped him with the reddit bitcoin tipping bot after reading about his experiences. Justas projects a zany, carefree but philosophical persona through his online material. For example, he blogged on 6th December:  ""Freedom is why I am homeless… feeding myself from trash/wilderness is lots of fun. I cannot even imagine going through the tedious and disgusting process of shopping.""  His YouTube videos often feature detailed footage of street cats, but also include tutorials on scavenging for food in a city, programming and logo design. The itinerant redditor says that he scavenges to survive and refuses to beg. He posted on reddit:  ""I never beg and would feel very evil to do so.""  Justas discovered bitcoin through the very forum where he currently posts about his experiences. He said:  ""I got into bitcoin through reddit. I first heard about it from the Piratebay creators, but as far as I understood back in 2009, it was something to pay for movies and such so I didn't investigate it more. I ventured to the bitcoin subreddit and my mind was blown away… banks were a pain in the ass for a homeless person, so I immediately embraced bitcoin!""  The bitcoin community on reddit appears to be embracing him back. Besides receiving bitcoin tips from the tipping bot, redditors have written in support of Justas' nomadic lifestyle. One redditor wrote:  ""Anyhow, just live your life however you want man, rock on.""  Justas said he is publicly documenting his experiences online to create a community of ""pioneers"" who would adopt a nomadic way of life as he has. He created the r/homelesstribe subreddit for that purpose.  Bitcoin has impacted the homeless elsewhere as well. In Florida, a homeless charity named Sean's Outpost is thriving after it started accepting bitcoin.  Justas said he is planning to travel to Tahiti to indulge in his hobby of free-diving. Free-diving requires the diver to hold his or her breath underwater until resurfacing. No breathing apparatus is used.  Justas claims he can free-dive for up to four minutes. The current free-diving record, in terms of time, is 10 minutes and five seconds, according to Wikipedia.  ""[Tahiti] has perfect weather, not too many people and excellent diving conditions,"" he said in a Skype chat.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/30/voluntarily-homeless-man-lives-off-bitcoin-android-tablet-and-a-solar-charger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5da37acf754f819022481cf3116139207e2147d-1024x568.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
