Bankrupt Voyager Sends Millions In SHIB And ETH To Coinbase,"Voyager Digital has been busy in recent months as it looks to sell its remaining crypto holdings on centralized exchanges. In its latest move, the bankrupt crypto brokerage has transferred millions in SHIB and ETH to Coinbase. According to on-chain data, Voyager moved SHIB and ETH tokens to Coinbase’s ledger on Friday, August 11. Millions In SHIB And ETH Transferred To Coinbase By Voyager Voyager has been selling off assets since the beginning of the year. Specifically, the latest on-chain transactions show that Voyager moved a total of $5.5 million in crypto to Coinbase. The transactions consisted of 1,500 ETH sent in two transactions. Related Reading: Did XRP Price Really Hit $50 On Gemini Exchange? Before being moved to Coinbase, 1,000 ETH and 500 ETH, with a combined value of $2.77 million, were sent to separate wallets. Another 250 billion SHIB valued at $2.7 million was then sent to Coinbase. On-chain data also shows that Voyager has been moving all its token holdings to its primary address. This likely means the company is consolidating its crypto assets before moving them to crypto exchanges. Bankrupt crypto firm Voyager transferred 1,500 ETH ($2.77 million) and 250 billion SHIB ($2.7 million) to Coinbase. Additionally, Voyager is moving all remaining tokens to the main address. There are currently about $81.63 million worth of cryptocurrency in Voyager addresses.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 12, 2023 Looking To Pay Pack Customers Voyager’s goal is to eventually reimburse all customer accounts, at least partially. The firm went bankrupt last year after the failure of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital which failed to repay its $665 million Voyager loan. The company, however, received court approval in May 2023 to begin winding down its operations and start repaying customers a portion of their crypto assets that’s been locked for over a year. According to court filings, Voyager had only about $630 million to pay back $1.8 billion in customer claims. As a result, Voyager users could only claim 35.72% of their tokens. They could either withdraw their claims immediately or choose to wait for 30 days to be paid in USD after Voyager sells the tokens. VGX prices tanks as bankruptcy proceedings continue | Source: VGXUSDT on Tradingview.com At the time, data from Arkham Intelligence showed that Voyager had $268 million in ETH, $236 million in USDC, and $77 million in SHIB. But now that the time for customer claims is over, Voyager seems to be consolidating its remaining assets into one address before selling them. According to Arkham Intel, there is currently about $81.63 million worth of cryptocurrency left in Voyager addresses. What This Means For SHIB And ETH Prices The recent transfers of millions of dollars in SHIB and ETH tokens from Voyager Digital to Coinbase could signal selling pressure is on the way for the two cryptocurrencies. If Coinbase unloads these tokens onto the open market, it may drive prices down further as supply outpaces demand.

But adoption of the cryptocurrency asset ""is unlikely to be significant in the near term,"" Bank of America said in a recent research note, citing a lack of wallet compatibility, exchange trading pairs, or new functionality. “Over the longer term, we expect PYUSD to experience additional adoption headwinds as competition from CBDCs ( central bank digital currencies ) and yield-bearing stablecoins increases,” analyst Alkesh Shah wrote. Last week, PayPal ( PYPL ) rolled out its dollar-pegged stablecoin at a time when such tokens have taken little share in consumer payments as regulators assess the stability of such transactions. Stablecoins , whose value is pegged to an asset, have been around for roughly a decade, but they’re mostly used by traders to facilitate trades on crypto exchanges, as well as serve as the underlying asset for crypto loans. PY-USD is structurally different to algorithmic stablecoins like collapsed TerraUSD in that its supply is not regulated by an algorithm and it’s backed by low risk and liquid assets, including U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasurys, and similar cash equivalents. Two of the largest stablecoins by market cap – Tether ( USDT-USD ) and USD Coin ( USDC-USD ) – are also pegged to the U.S. dollar. “Investors may have been fine holding non-yield bearing stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, when rates were close to zero, but yield-bearing stablecoins will likely become increasingly available and attractive with short-term rates above 5%,” Shah contended. All in, Shah reckons investors generally don’t have a preference for which stablecoins they hold “as long as the stablecoins are perceived as safe and accessible on the largest trading platforms.” For PY-USD’s impact on the overall adoption of stablecoins, Konstantin Shulga, CEO and co-founder of Finery Markets, a multi-dealer electronic communication network for crypto firms, expects “an uptick in user familiarity and trust in stablecoins,” given PayPal’s ( PYPL ) outsized global reach and the ""integration of PYUSD for peer-to-peer payments, including between digital wallets like PayPal and Venmo."" But, amid a lack of U.S. regulation for stablecoins, ethereum-based PY-USD has already drawn a harsh rebuke from Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. On Wednesday, she warned that it’s vital to establish “clear and strong consumer protections at the federal level,” given PayPal’s ( PYPL ) immense customer base of 435M and the fact that stablecoin payments are a practice that has yet to gain ground. Nonetheless, PayPal ( PYPL ) appears willing to be transparent with the public about its holdings, and rightfully so, given all the fuss late last year over some of Tether's reserve assets. Starting in September 2023, PayPal ( PYPL ) had said in a statement, Paxos Trust Company, which is issuing PY-USD, will publish a public monthly Reserve Report for the token that outlines the instruments composing the reserves. It will also issue a public third-party attestation of the value of PY-USD reserve assets.

Then Prove BTC Is Not Manipulated, Says SEC","With multiple applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF already filed, many have continued to speculate when the SEC is likely to give its approval or otherwise. To further add to speculations, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, citing his sources, stated that approval was likely to come within four to six months. However, recent developments seem to suggest that the wait could be longer. SEC Stalling? In a release dated August 11, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has moved to delay the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF in a move that could be seen as a delay tactic by the regulator. Related Reading: San Francisco’s SoFi Bank Reveals Significant Holdings In BTC, ETH, And DOGE Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest and 21Shares had collaborated again to refile for a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year after the SEC rejected previous applications. Following the standard procedures, the SEC was meant to approve or disapprove the application by August 13. However, with its latest order calling for public input on ARK 21 Shares application, this deadline is consequently extended. With this, the general public has three weeks to give further comments on the proposal, while the SEC has another five weeks to respond to any comments it may receive. Furthermore, the SEC can choose to extend the deadline by 240 days at the maximum (a move that could potentially delay a final response until Jan 10, 2024). This news would most likely not come as a surprise to ARK Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood, as she had predicted a delay when speaking to Bloomberg on August 7. She also forecasted that the SEC might approve multiple Bitcoin ETF applications. However, nothing is certain, as the regulator could also deny all applications as it has done in the past. BTC price finds support above $29,300 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Concerns Over Bitcoin Manipulation & Regulation While the crypto community swallows the hard pill of the SEC’s latest move, some experts have called attention to the SEC’s multiple uses of the word “manipulation” in its latest release. This is worrisome, considering that the SEC had previously rejected spot Bitcoin ETF applications on the grounds of potential market manipulation. Furthermore, the SEC’s continued reference to this word may also mean that the regulator, maybe in a bid to frustrate these applications, could ask that they prove that Bitcoin is not a manipulated asset class. Related Reading: Did XRP Price Really Hit $50 On Gemini Exchange? That will undoubtedly be a huge ask considering that, over time, there have been instances that raised speculations that the crypto market can be manipulated by major players. Furthermore, Bitcoin is a borderless and decentralized currency, and even if the SEC were to move to regulate its use in the US, the ETF market could still be manipulated by external activities from outside the US. The SEC also made raised concerns about Bitcoin not having a “regulated market or significant size,” something which could hinder the approval of any spot-traded Bitcoin ETF. The agency pointed out the fact that Bitcoin Future ETFs were approved because they were regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Following a recent buying spree in the LINK market, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has taken to social media platform X, providing some insights on the token’s potential price action. Related Reading: LINK Price Prediction: Chainlink Turns Attractive On Dips 29,000 Wallets Purchase 295 Million LINK Forming Major Support Level On August 11, Ali posted on X stating that Chainlink has established a strong support zone between $6.63 and $6.88 as about 29,000 addresses purchased over 295 million LINK at this price range based on data from analytics firm IntoTheBlock. Moving on, he postulated that as long as the altcoin was trading above this price zone, investors were likely to continuously remain bullish, especially as Soon-chain data shows that there are no significant resistance levels ahead. Source: IntoTheBlock According to Ali, a good number of LINK whales have already recognized the $6.63-6.88 zone as “robust” price support and are actively accumulating more tokens. He highlighted that in the past 14 days, LINK whales have purchased an estimated 13 million LINK worth around $91 million. However, while these developments may be considered indications of a bullish LINK market, Ali states that traders anticipating a market breakout may still need to exercise some patience. Using data from IntoTheBlock, the crypto analyst draws attention to the declining network activity on the Chainlink network in the last three weeks. Ali stated that during this period, the number of large LINK transactions had gone down from 527 to 118. He concluded his market report by stating a boost in this metric is likely to precede any market breakout. At the time of writing, LINK is exchanging hands at $7.44, with a 1.36% decline in the last day, according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, the token is up 3.66% and 17.67% in the last seven and thirty days, respectively. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Holds Above 14% Gains As Crypto Market Slumps Heavily More Good News For Chainlink Aside from Ali’s market analysis, there has been other positive news about Chainlink in recent days. Also, on August 11, market intelligence firm Santiment reported LINK had experienced its highest level of dormant coin movements in the last six weeks. According to Santiment, this represented a decline in LINK’s mean dollar invested age curve, pointing to a decrease in the token’s time in wallets which is usually a precursor for a rise in market cap. In addition, Chainlink has maintained a rise in its development activity over the last few months. Based on data from Santiment, development activity on Chainlink went up from 1579.12 on May 31 to 1706.48 on August 3.

They have been so committed to promoting Uwerx’s vision and purpose that investors and users could completely trust them and buy into the project. This was part of why the Uwerx launch was overwhelmingly successful, surpassing expectations and initial forecasts. The developers are back to work and ready to take Uwerx to the next level. However, they witnessed a setback as Uwerx was attacked. The team has yet again shown commitment by quickly and efficiently developing recovery strategies and plans. This article will detail the launch, updates, the hack, and Uwerx’s road to recovery. Uwerx’s Successful Launch: Developers Set To Renounce Smart Contract Ownership After so much anticipation, Uwerx finally launched on August 1, 2023. The launch was successful, as everyone wanted to become a WERX holder. Also, investors and users made tons of profits with all the bonuses that were up. The developers released updates on what to expect next from Uwerx as soon as the launch ended. Uwerx has finally deployed liquidity on Uniswap. The Uwerx Vault, which received positive feedback from 84% of the community, will soon be available as the smart contracts await a thorough audit. To show their commitment to Uwerx’s community, the developers immediately began the 25-year liquidity locking they promised to do once Uwerx launched. They are also ready to denounce smart contract ownership when Uwerx goes live on centralized exchanges. The team has submitted their applications to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko to facilitate this. The team is working to ensure the Uwerx platform is completed immediately. They are working on the core functionality design, focusing on Freelancer, Client, and Agency Dashboards, Project Management, and Additional Settings Pages. Once this is finished, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with functions will be released to the community for testing. Based on the feedback obtained, they will proceed with the premium design. There will be a buyback campaign that will scale accordingly to provide support for Uwerx. It will happen weekly, although the dates and times will not be released to avoid anyone taking unfair advantage of the system. Uwerx Gets Exploited On August 2, Uwerx reported it got hacked, with the hacker stealing around $327,000. The attacker flash-loaned 20,000 ETH, which he swapped for 5,053,637 WERX. He then sent 4,429,817 WERX to the Uniswap pool. This amount was ten times the prior balance. Afterward, he used the skim() function of Uniswap with the address 0x00...1 as the “to” address. He also used the transfer function of the Uwerx contract, which first modifies a sender’s balance. Since the “to” address was a UniswapPoolAddress (0x00...1), an extra 1% of the initial amount was burned. As a result, there was an imbalance that the attacker took advantage of to gain 176 ETH ($327,000). Uwerx Maintains Momentum As It Sets To Relaunch Despite the hack, Uwerx continues to shine as it devises ways to tackle the hack and maintain its momentum. Once they noticed the hack, they immediately alerted SolidProof and InterFiNetwork, their auditors. Also, the team contacted PeckShieldAlert and SlowMist_Team directly on Twitter. The team began by putting out a white-hat bounty, stating the attacker should return 80% of the exploited funds and keep 20%. A new WERX will be relaunched, and its platform will have more robust security measures. As to the relaunch, there will be a new contract address, which will be released to the community soon. However, the contract address will be audited twice by reputable companies and once by an independent contractor. Due to a change in the contract address, the Uwerx Vault smart contracts are being altered, after which they will be audited before being released to the public. The new WERX will be deployed on the Polygon network instead of Uniswap, on which it is currently deployed. This will enable token holders to easily use WERX on the Uwerxplatform without having to bridge, and it will also lower gas fees. However, those who bought WERX on Uniswap will not be abandoned. The team has decided to airdrop the tokens at the end of the vesting period to ensure they still benefit. They also assure those who bought WERX during the presale that they are safe and will be unaffected by the relaunch. The new WERX will be deployed with more liquidity. To do this, the funds reserved for the buyback campaign will be directed to liquidity. Also, the team is proposing a no-burn tax and a sliding sell tax, of which 100% will be directed to liquidity. A poll is already up on Uwerx’s Twitter page and Telegram channel, asking the community if they support a sliding sell tax wholly directed to liquidity. Another poll also asks the community how long the vesting period should be. These polls will end on August 13, after which the development of the new WERX will commence on August 14. The team also welcomes feedback or opinions, which can be sent to feedback@uwerx.network. Also, there will be press releases this week and another major announcement on August 21 to update the community on the new WERX development and plans for the relaunch. The Uwerx platform development is ongoing, and the team has completed certain sections like Settings, Security, Help Center, Login, Privacy Policy, Create Account, and Finished Payments. The WERX allocations will also be changed, and the new allocation is: ● Presale: 57% (427,500,000)● User Performance Incentives: 6% (45,000,000) ● Liquidity Reserve: 14% (105,500,000)● Marketing: 9% (67,500,000) ● Team Tokens: 6% (45,000,000) ● Partnership Incentives: 2% (15,000,000)● Joining Incentives: 6% ( 45,000,000) At the end of the presale, 25,499,071 WERX will be burned. The airdrop and vesting schedules were shifted, and the new schedules have been released. Uwerx’s whitepaper will also be modified to reflect the ongoing changes. Uwerx is on to big things, and once the polls are concluded on August 13, the team will announce the specific details of the new WERX, as they are committed to launching it as soon as possible. Uwerx’s dedication throughout this period has been incredible. Their efforts in tackling this challenge have removed all forms of doubt and fear the community initially had.

Over the past seven days, THORChain has experienced a substantial surge in its price, marking an impressive increase of 20.19%. This resurgence has sparked intrigue and excitement among crypto enthusiasts and investors, prompting a closer examination of the factors contributing to this rapid upward movement. The Catalysts Behind The Surge RUNE has made a resurgence in recent months from its lows in June to its recent highs gaining 40% during this period. However, its price is still 10% down from the start of the year and there are expectations that this could be an extended bullrun. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Keeps Energy Alive, Snags 26% Gain – Here’s The Inside Scoop The surge in THORChain’s price invites a deeper investigation into the underlying dynamics and catalysts that have propelled this substantial price rally. While a myriad of factors often influences the cryptocurrency market, several key drivers may have played a role in THORChain’s recent surge: Substantial progress in THORChain’s underlying technology, protocol enhancements, and ecosystem expansion has triggered renewed interest and investment. Positive fundamental developments often align with price surges as investors anticipate potential long-term growth prospects. Cryptocurrency markets are renowned for their inherent volatility. While volatility can create risks, it allows traders to capitalize on price swings. The recent surge in THORChain’s price may be driven, in part, by heightened market volatility. THORChain (RUNE): Forecasting Future Trajectories Considering THORChain’s recent surge, attention naturally turns to the future prospects of this cryptocurrency. Various experts and analysts have offered their insights into THORChain’s potential trajectory. Related Reading: GMX Drops 24% in 1 Month, Whales Rapidly Selling: What’s Going On? According to short-term prediction, THORChain’s price could experience a minor retracement to $1.02 by August 16, followed by a recovery to $1.24 by September 9. This prediction underscores the inherent volatility of short-term price movements. Looking ahead to 2023, divergent forecasts paint a range of possibilities. CaptainAltCoin suggests a potential dip to $0.6726 by October, with the year closing at $0.8817. However, if the bull run continues to persist there could be a spike to $2.12 by the year’s end. Navigating The Unpredictable Path Ahead As THORChain continues its remarkable surge, the crypto community remains captivated by its price movement. The convergence of various factors, including market sentiment, technical indicators, fundamental developments, and overall market volatility, has likely contributed to this recent rally. However, the cryptocurrency landscape is known for its unpredictability, and the path ahead for THORChain remains uncertain. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

This comes after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a delay letter regarding Ark Invest’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. In a widely-anticipated delay, the SEC is asking for new written comments on the spot Bitcoin application. Some of the issues raised by the commission include the suitability of Bitcoin as an underlying asset of an exchange-traded product, and the resistance of Bitcoin to price manipulation, amongst other things. The Ark Invest spot ETF, proposed by leading asset management firm ARK Invest in conjunction with Swiss-based 21Shares, would give investors indirect exposure to Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the market. This recent setback has raised questions about the fate of the spot Bitcoin ETF applications of other asset management companies, including Blackrock, Valkyrie, WisdomTree, etc. Related Reading: Black Swan Author Warns Of Bitcoin Volume Slump As BTC Fails To Breach $30,000 North America’s Share Of Global ETF Trading Volume To Reach 99.5%? In the event that the spot Bitcoin ETF applications get greenlighted by the SEC, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that the North American region may see its percentage of the crypto ETF trading volumes reach 99.5%. According to his post on X (formerly Twitter), North America currently accounts for 97.67% of the total crypto ETF trading volume in the world. “If/when spot ETFs come out in the US this will likely go to like 99.5%,” Balchunas noted. In another post, the Bloomberg analyst disclosed that most of the best-performing equity ETFs in 2023 are crypto-related. At the top of this list is $WGMI, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF, with a year-to-date return of 227%. This actively-managed fund invests in public companies in the Bitcoin mining industry, including Riot, Bitdeer, Cipher Mining, etc. Given the positive performance of these mining firms’ stocks, it is no surprise that investment products, like $WGMI, are doing well. Other top-performing crypto-related exchange-traded products on this list include the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF, with a YTD return of 182%; the Global X Blockchain ETF, which has returned 168% so far in 2023; and the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF, also up by roughly 168% year to date. Pending Grayscale Lawsuit To Be Pivotal To Bitcoin ETF Approval In 2022, Grayscale Investments sued the SEC for rejecting the application to convert its flagship product, GBTC, into a spot Bitcoin ETF. According to Nathan Geraci, president of the ETF Store, the final judgment in this lawsuit could prove pivotal in the race for Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Geraci commented on the delay of Ark Invest ETF: It all comes down to the outcome of the Grayscale lawsuit & SEC’s view of question #4 here (referring to the fourth subject the commission is seeking comments on). Related Reading: San Francisco’s SoFi Bank Reveals Significant Holdings In BTC, ETH, And DOGE Earlier in March, Grayscale argued against the commission, questioning the logic behind allowing Bitcoin futures ETFs while disapproving similar spot Bitcoin funds.

At the same time, its sister project DeGods released a preview of the artwork for its Season III collection, leading to a boost in trading volume.  Meanwhile, Coinbase officially launched its Base blockchain and is celebrating with Onchain Summer, a multi-week series of Web3 activations across art, gaming and music with brand partners like Coca-Cola and Friends With Benefits. The biggest mover on Base so far though is the new friends.tech app, but the project raises some red flags.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  On God: Popular NFT collection DeGods saw its sales soar after sharing plans and teasing artwork for its 20,000-edition Season III collection. Within 24 hours of the announcement, trading volume increased nearly 200% while its floor price decreased. Notably, female-presenting NFTs will be added to the collection, which are swappable for male-presenting ones. To avoid dilution, each individual DeGod NFT will have four pieces of generative art associated with it.  Y00 too: In conjunction with the announcement of a new DeGods collection, sister project y00ts said that it would soon be migrating away from the Polygon blockchain and onto Ethereum. Project lead Rohun Vora, known as Frank, explained that the shift was meant to “unite the DeGods and y00ts communities” on the same blockchain to simplify the ecosystem. Notably, y00ts accepted a $3 million grant from Polygon to migrate to its chain earlier this year, though the NFT project said it would return 100% of the funding it received.  Hot chain Summer: Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., officially launched its Base blockchain after weeks of teasing the initiative. The new blockchain is a layer 2 built on top of Ethereum using stack software from another popular layer 2 network, Optimism, and already boasts over 100 compatible decentralized apps (dapps) within its ecosystem.  Non-fungible festival: In connection with the launch, Coinbase launched Onchain Summer, a multi-week series of Web3 activations across art, gaming and music with partners like Coca-Cola, social DAO Friends With Benefits and NFT minting platform Zora.

The upcoming halving event in 2024 has generated significant anticipation, drawing attention to the complex interaction of various elements that contribute to the value and destiny of the subject in question. Bitcoin’s value has increased by 75% so far this year despite having to deal with regulatory scrutiny and fraud. The leading crypto in terms of market cap and widespread adoption has shown surprising resilience in the face of US Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions against key exchanges like Binance.US and Coinbase. Bitcoin’s Price Performance Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $29,411, up a meager 0.2% in the last day, but managed to gain a decent 1.4% in the last week, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. Bitcoin is currently showing a neutral stance in the market and facing resistance as it tries to surpass the key $29,600 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024/25: 4-Year Cycle And Elliot Wave Can Coexist Bitcoin price flashing green in all timeframes. Source: Coingecko If there’s a bullish breakout above $29,600, it could potentially open up the path for Bitcoin to reach the $30,200 level. The top coin has already reached the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, which is at $29,200. Bitcoin reached a market cap of $572 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com On the other hand, Bitcoin’s price could change in a big way if it can break through the support level of $30,200. This accomplishment could act as a catalyst and push the value of the coin into a new range, which is thought to be between $30,600 and $31,000. Such a breakthrough could make the market more hopeful and boost investor trust, which could set the stage for more growth. The critical zones to watch are $29,800 and $30,200. If Bitcoin’s price moves below these levels, it could indicate a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retraces Back From $30,000 As Profit Taking Spikes Bitcoin Price Prediction Meanwhile, Cypherpunk figure Adam Back has bet on Bitcoin hitting six figures by March 2024. He made the wager on Twitter, predicting that Bitcoin will surpass $100,000 before the March 31, 2024 halving. The bet is with the Twitter user “Vikingo,” with the winner receiving 1 million satoshis (0.01 Bitcoin). the bet is on🚀: i bet #bitcoin reaches or exceeds $100k between now and halving (31st Mar 2024) with @vikingobitcoin9 1million sats to the winner. https://t.co/Ij7iPEYjQW pic.twitter.com/PNpAaZvl8F — Adam Back (@adam3us) August 5, 2023 For Bitcoin to meet this target, it needs a 243% increase in the next eight months. Before the previous halving in May 2020, Bitcoin saw a range-bound period without major gains. The most significant price surge occurred about six months post-halving, initiating a bullish market trend in November of that year. Understanding Bitcoin Halving Bitcoin halving refers to the occurrence where miners’ rewards for validating blockchain transactions are halved. This event takes place roughly every 210,000 mined blocks, which translates to approximately every four years. Introduced by Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2009, halvings serve the purpose of regulating asset supply. The mining reward reduces by half every 210,000 blocks, aligning with Nakamoto’s original vision as outlined in the white paper. This mechanism ensures the controlled creation of Bitcoin and maintains incentives for miners. The historical trend of halvings driving price escalation underscores the intricate interplay between scarcity, demand, and Bitcoin’s valuation, accentuating the anticipation surrounding the forthcoming halving’s influence on prices.

Signs Of Revival Emerge Amidst Market Uncertainty A recent price analysis points out that the RSI has edged closer to the neutral 50 level, marking a significant shift from its recent spell within the oversold zone. This shift suggests an increasing appetite for DOT tokens among traders, potentially setting the stage for a bullish resurgence.

The CMF, a measure of the volume and flow of capital into or out of a cryptocurrency, has made a decisive move from the zero mark, currently standing at +0.20. This reading highlights the influx of capital into DOT, indicating a growing sense of positivity and enthusiasm among buyers. Polkadot (DOT) market cap at $6.09 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Polkadot Bulls Eye Key Price Levels, Bears Await In the coming days, bulls within the DOT market are gearing up to challenge the bears for ownership of the crucial $5.23 price level. A successful flip of this level into a support zone could potentially pave the way for further gains. Market analysts speculate that should this support level be reclaimed, DOT could make strides towards $5.50 and potentially reach $6. However, a rejection at these levels could send DOT on a downward trajectory, with a potential dip towards the $4.5 range. $DOT #Polkadot If it goes down to the last low at $4 it would be a 16% loss. If it goes up to the big resistance at 24$ it would be a 375% profit. Do you think it’s worth the risk to buy at $5? pic.twitter.com/GPBSm7XKpM — Tony ₿itcoin⚡ (@Toni_Bitcoin) August 11, 2023 The outcome of DOT’s price movements is also tied to the performance of the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC). Should BTC fail to sustain its ongoing price rally, DOT’s trajectory could be influenced.

As the battle between bulls and bears ensues, traders and investors alike will keenly watch the pivotal price levels, with the hope of witnessing a substantial market turnaround.

This resurgence comes on the heels of a determined effort by sellers to flip the altcoin’s trajectory bearish, following a price rejection at the critical $29 resistance level. However, SOL’s retreat from this resistance proved to be a strategic move as it found support in the bullish order block (OB) at $22, setting the stage for a renewed uptrend. SOL’s journey from the formidable $29 price mark to the bullish order block at $22 was pivotal. A recent price analysis has underscored the importance of this OB as a key level for the altcoin’s potential reversal of fortunes. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Keeps Energy Alive, Snags 26% Gain – Here’s The Inside Scoop With a long-term perspective in mind, Solana’s ability to rally from this OB demonstrates the resolve of buyers to reclaim control. This recovery has not only bolstered sentiment but also signified the strategic importance of this price juncture in steering the trend. BTC’s Influence On SOL’s Trajectory One notable factor underpinning Solana’s current narrative is the role of Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency. As SOL seeks to flip the $25.3 resistance level into a supportive base for further gains, its success may very well depend on the continued bullish advance of Bitcoin. The interplay between these two prominent cryptocurrencies remains a significant aspect to monitor, as BTC’s trajectory often influences the broader altcoin market sentiment. At present, Solana stands at a price of $24.50, as per CoinGecko data. Despite a slight decline of 1.0% over the last 24 hours, the altcoin has showcased a commendable seven-day rally of 8.8%, indicative of its capacity to rebound from adversities. Solana weekend price action. Source: Coingecko However, a notable challenge emerges as SOL inches closer to the $25.7 mark. The impending supply pressure at this level could potentially stall the upward momentum, prompting a sideways trend and leading to a consolidation phase. Solana: Clearing The Path Forward Should the SOL price encounter intensified supply pressure around the $25.7 threshold, a distinct possibility is the emergence of a narrow price range during trading sessions. This consolidation phase, while seemingly a temporary lull, may serve a vital purpose. By trimming away weaker positions, this period could pave the way for a definitive directional movement.

Observing the current price action, the likelihood of SHIB reaching these levels appears favorable, painting a bright outlook for this meme coin. The transformation in SHIB’s fortunes extends beyond price fluctuations. Previously, a prolonged period of time saw over 80% of SHIB holders facing losses. However, recent data from Chain Afirk, an African web3 community on Twitter, indicates a significant shift. The market capitalization of Shiba Inu is currently $6.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Approximately 33.03% of SHIB holders have now transitioned into a profitable position, signaling a shift in the memecoin’s fortunes. This change not only brings relief to long-time holders but also underlines the growing resilience of the token. Shiba Inu: The Key NVT Signal Analyzing the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) signal provides further insights into SHIB’s current state. According to Glassnode data cited by a price analysis, the NVT metric has surged to 170.52. This high NVT signal implies that SHIB’s market capitalization has surpassed its transaction volume, potentially pointing to an inflated state. This phenomenon could be indicative of the token reaching a market top, warranting vigilance from investors.

Open interest in Binance's SHIB futures has more than doubled to $101.65 million this month, hitting the highest since Feb. 5, according to data source Coinglass. SHIB futures are sized at 1,000 SHIB per contract with up to 25 times leverage.  SHIB's market value has jumped nearly 32% to $6.58 billion amid optimism that an impending layer-2 launch will help the cryptocurrency shed its meme-coin tag.  An increase in open interest alongside a rise in market capitalization suggests an influx of new money in the SHIB market. This scenario has historically presaged weakness in bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value.  SHIB's open interest has risen above the $100 million mark at least seven times since its inception. The previous six spikes marked local bitcoin price tops.  The pattern is consistent with traditional markets where outsized gains in meme stocks relative to defensive plays are seen as a contrary indicator for the broader market.

42392703,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAPaP,1691806685,"U.S. Senator Lummis, Crypto Lobbyists Urge Court to Dismiss SEC's Coinbase Lawsuit","U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wy.), a number of crypto lobbying organizations and a group of professors called on a federal court to dismiss a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against crypto exchange Coinbase Friday.  Filing amicus – or friend of the court – briefs, the organizations and lawmaker alleged the SEC was trying to exceed its authority in bringing a lawsuit alleging crypto trading platforms like Coinbase are simultaneously unregistered securities exchanges, brokers and clearinghouses trading similarly unregistered securities in the form of crypto assets. The SEC brought lawsuits against Coinbase and fellow exchange Binance (and the latter's U.S. arm, Binance.US) in June this year.  The amicus briefs, addressed to Judge Katherine Polk Failla, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, echo Coinbase’s own arguments in its motion for judgment dismissing the case.  In total, lobby organizations including the Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, Chamber of Digital Commerce, DeFi Education Fund, Chamber of Progress, Consumer Technology Association, venture firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm and half a dozen academics filed a total of six briefs, not including the Senator’s.  Earlier this month, Coinbase argued in its motion for judgment that the transactions the SEC pointed to didn’t meet the definition of an investment contract and therefore weren’t a violation of securities law.  The amicus briefs come a day after the SEC settled similar charges with Bittrex, another global exchange with a U.S. arm. The U.S. arm is in bankruptcy proceedings.  “This is no run-of-the-mill enforcement case. Through this case the SEC seeks primary influence over economic, political, and legal questions under active consideration by Congress and multiple agencies,” the brief filed on behalf of Lummis said. “Amicus submits this brief to highlight: (i) the important questions implicated here, which are properly before Congress right now; and (ii) the fundamental separation-of-powers principles that weigh strongly in favor of deferring to Congress rather than adopting the SEC’s novel and expansive view of its own authority.”  Almost all of the briefs cited the recent Supreme Court case West Virginia vs. the Environment Protection Agency, which held that regulatory agencies couldn’t broadly exceed their mandate without Congressional approval.  The argument was recently rejected by another federal judge in the same court overseeing a different SEC case against a crypto platform. Judge Jed Rakoff, rejecting a motion to dismiss by Terraform Labs, wrote that the crypto industry isn't yet of a sufficient significance as to meet those Supreme Court precedents.  It's also unclear whether Congress will take any speedy action on broad crypto regulation. While the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees recently advanced legislation that would address market structure and stablecoin issues, the film House has yet to take the bills up. The House seems likely to advance the bills, but the bills’ passage through an evenly divided Senate is uncertain.  Lummis's brief did note that lawmakers – including herself and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) – have introduced a number of bills in recent years that specifically lay out where the SEC’s jurisdiction lies, and where its sister regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), may take over.  “Each of these bills recognizes that the crypto industry does not fit entirely within existing securities laws and transcends the current statutory powers of the SEC. The multitude of interests at stake require a holistic approach beyond the scope of a single agency, including approaches taken around the world. Congress is attuned to these important considerations,” the brief said.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has overseen the regulator since 2021, told CoinDesk last year that in his view, many crypto tokens already meet the standards for securities regulation.  “It's about that common enterprise and that entrepreneurial effort which is the hallmark of investment contracts, which are securities. So I think that's where we are, that most of the tokens meet the traditional standards that our Supreme Court has laid out, and that we, the SEC, have a role to help protect investors and instill and enhance trust in these markets,” he said. “They don't just resemble securities, they are securities.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/12/us-senator-lummis-crypto-lobbyists-urge-court-to-dismiss-secs-coinbase-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4fa2c801118c5f664814f5832fe8ead1735339f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15928245,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546950,1691802001,"GMX Drops 24% in 1 Month, Whales Rapidly Selling: What’s Going On?","GMX, the native token powering GMX, a decentralized perpetual exchange for trading complex crypto derivatives, is under intense selling pressure when writing on August 11. Trackers show that the governance token is down 7% on the last trading day, pushing monthly losses to 24%. This downturn has seen prices tumble close to $40, a critical support level last printed in January and June 2023. Whales Dumping, Prices Fall Despite this setback, DeFiLlama’s data is stable as GMX’s Total Value Locked (TVL) remains over $534 million. Most of the trading platform’s liquidity is locked in Arbitrum, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Additionally, another portion is locked on Avalanche, a fourth-generation Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform focused on decentralized finance (DeFi). The sell-off on August 11 coincides with actions by GMX “whales.” According to Lookonchain data, four whales sold 62,274 GMX worth $3 million. Address “0xb824” liquidated 19,786 GMX, translating to 514 ETH, and “0xa38a” sold 11,667 GMX for 305 ETH, losing $50,000 in the process. Meanwhile, “0X85b7” sold 20,000 GMX for 510 ETH, and “0x0b80” mirrored this move, dumping 10,820 GMX. Related Reading: Curve Finance Resurgence: 70% Of Stolen Funds Recovered, Redemption On The Horizon Whales are selling amid a constant decline in TVL in DeFi. This contraction can be traced to the general cool-off from late 2021, when crypto prices peaked before dropping in 2022, crashing on-chain activity, especially in DeFi. At spot rates, it is changing hands at $46, an almost 50% decline from $91 registered in Q2 of 2023. Even so, the token is up nearly 4X from its all-time low. Whales’ action, nonetheless, could send ripples of uncertainty throughout the GMX and DeFi communities. Crypto traders actively keep track of whale activity. Usually, when they sell, as was the case today, it could sow fear, leading others to follow suit, heaping more pressure on prices. GMX Launches v2 Beta On August 6, GMX released the v2 version in beta on Arbitrum and Avalanche. The exchange said this version introduces several enhancements, including support for more assets, including XRP. With v2, users can also utilize diverse collateral types for trading positions while trading more quickly with reduced fees and lower slippage. Related Reading: Did XRP Price Really Hit $50 On Gemini Exchange With v2, the exchange adds, is the introduction of isolated pools for liquidity providers to customize their exposure to preferred tokens.
