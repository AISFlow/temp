42432429,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCLzh,1595538303,Climbing off Twitter on Scaffolds of Truth: Where Srinivasan and Benet Diverge,"In the American epic ""Lonesome Dove"" by Larry McMurtry, there are two characters who can see much further than the other members of their gang: Captain Gus McCrae and Joshua Deets. McCrae's co-captain, Woodrow Call, and their fellow cowboys learn to take Deets and McCrae at their word when they say they see something out where the Earth bends.      Listening to Filecoin founder Juan Benet is like that.      When he's really trying to peer into the future of the internet, what he sees is hazy and chimerical, but he's seeing something, anticipating either what must be built or the consequences of inaction.      This stood out Wednesday night when Benet shared the Zoom stage with Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and former Coinbase executive Balaji Srinivasan, both of whom are strong futurists.      The conversation, sponsored by HackFS, ETHGlobal and Protocol Labs, was billed as a ""debate,"" but one had to wonder what these fellow travelers down blockchain's volatile highway would actually disagree about.      To state the low-energy dispute simply, Srinivasan is focused on urgently shaking up the information distribution system, whereas Benet is more worried about people ever trusting anything they don't see themselves. That is: verification of source material.      ""[People] don't have a good mechanism for achieving truth,"" Benet said. ""That is a much worse state than where we are now, and that could be precipitated by centralized or decentralized media not taking these problems seriously.""    Get off Twitter    Srinivasan strongly advocates that superusers of social media gradually exit networks like Twitter and start reverting back to their own blogs again.      He's been focused on this for months (see ""This Week in Startups"" from April and his keynote at Messari's Mainnet virtual conference in June). More recently, he described how Twitter users could build a minimum viable product for monetizable distribution from their own web domains.      In Wednesday's discussion, Srinivasan immediately linked the problems of social media with the problems of legacy media.      ""Decentralized media also means if you give individuals the ability to monetize on their own, potentially pseudonymously, there's less pressure for them to be part of an intellectual orthodoxy where they have to repeat certain nostrums to retain their job in an uncertain environment,"" he argued. The successful Substack newsletters are the ones that stand out for their originality, he said.      But Benet is not as ready to dismiss the practice of reporting as decisively as Srinivasan. He said:    ""The entire history of journalism is filled with incredible important advances and improvements that came simply because there was a series of articles that caused an important change to happen. So just recalling that that's the point, and even though right now the entire media incentive structure is kind of messed up, both in traditional media and social media, let's figure out how we can build a system that promotes that.""    For his part, Buterin went straight to the problem of social media, though, describing what he felt like everyone believed Twitter to be, the great ""water cooler"" where all kinds of people could chat and cross over tribal lines.      It sort of started that way, but that's not where it ended up. ""All of these different tribes that really disagree with each other are really yelling at each other and it's not at all clear that the result is better,"" Buterin said.      Srinivasan praised Facebook, Twitter and others for taking buggy services and making them available to the masses, for free.      But that all came at a cost, he argued.      ""There's an election happening every day on Twitter, and this is literally how policy is happening,"" Srinivasan said. ""Twitter is not always real life but it will be and it becomes real life.""    Scaffold of truth    Benet wants to see these networks disrupted, but he also thinks that with every new experiment on the distribution side we accrue a bit more technical debt on the validation side. Distribution of information is light years ahead of where it was in the 1980s, but, he said:      ""Part of what's happening now is we didn't put in any way of controlling for manipulation vectors and attack vectors in the entire stack. We've created a set of systems that can balkanize not around access or thought but rather balkanize on manipulation targets. It's very easy for attackers to divide the network.""      A core of this problem is disinformation campaigns that trick people into believing things about the world that aren't true, in such a way that the untruths persist even when they are repeatedly debunked.      Benet is skeptical about future experiments in social media if they don't happen alongside even more aggressive experiments in the verifiability of data and information.      ""A number of the first-order suggestions for most decentralized media … will make that problem orders of magnitude worse, not better,"" he said. ""So I think in order to succeed here, we have to look ahead of those problems and start talking about those larger issues of how do you get to systems that are attack-resistant, and that enable some distributed notion of getting to truth.""      Srinivasan is also thinking seriously about the truth problem. He talked about two concepts: oracles and advocates.      Oracles are cryptographically signed data feeds that prove their provenance and the fact that they haven't been tampered with. Advocates represent a proposal for machine-readable statements about perspective, a sort of ""robots.txt"" file for ideology, that would allow search engines and readers to understand the disposition of any writer as a way to characterize the arguments they make.      ""I like where a lot of that is headed,"" Benet said. ""I think there's a massive problem in just establishing truth.""    A more perfect web    In a TEDxSanFrancisco talk in 2016, Benet said the internet is ""the planet's most important technology."" But even then he felt it could be much better.      On Wednesday, it was clear he was still only at the beginning of some very complex ideas about the future.      Benet spoke about using natural language processing to find ways to turn human speech into structured data, so factual data could be extracted from claims.      He also talked about the need for a way to describe ""the scaffold of claims,"" that is to look back in an organized fashion at the prior claims any given new claim is based on. This would help humans or machines go backward to identify the truth or non-truth of any particular argument.      Benet's talking much more about the technical stack the web is built on here than he is about companies or business models. Almost everything on the web so far has been built on Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python, or versions thereof. That's the stack. Benet thinks there could be a future where a universal data store of some kind is a part of that stack, one that many websites can draw from.      ""My impression is we are headed to a much better future where the data structures are going to be decoupled from the [user interfaces],"" Benet said. ""There will be many different systems built atop the same information graph.""      And this was a point where Srinivasan agreed.      It's a crude version of it, but on some level Bitcoin already is what Benet is describing. It's a shared database about the truth, only in Bitcoin's case that truth extends no further than who owns which unspent transaction outputs.      It's a start, though, and one Srinivasan noted the wider world doesn't really appreciate. He said:    ""I think something that is massively still underappreciated by folks outside our space is the extent to which something like that already exists, in the sense that Coinbase and Binance and Blockchain.info ... are all different layers over the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.""    So maybe those two blockchains are the Captains McCrae and Call of this Web3 epic, leading us all like cantankerous cattle on the long road to the utopia of a decentralized Montana.      It remains to be seen which of the two will have to carry the other's corpse back to Texas, where he can give a last look at the burned-down saloon of our past internet, where Twitter played piano and Facebook tended bar.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/23/climbing-off-twitter-on-scaffolds-of-truth-where-srinivasan-and-benet-diverge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2038022cd1d64115f8604c0e466855a333f02eb1-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432434,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCM7h,1595536504,Signature Bank’s Crypto Deposits Grew $1B in Q2,"Out of the nearly $8 billion in deposit growth that Signature Bank saw in the second quarter of 2020, $1 billion was raked in by the firm’s digital assets team, according to the bank’s most recent earnings report.      While Signature doesn’t break out its total deposits by business line, the increase is a record for the New York-based, crypto-friendly bank. On an earnings call, Signature CEO Joseph DePaolo also attributed deposit growth to an increase across every business line in the bank, including the blockchain-based payment platform Signet.      The crypto industry is often a rich source of low-cost, non-interest bearing deposits for crypto-friendly banks like Signature, Silvergate Bank and Metropolitan Commercial Bank, and analysts have paid close attention to Signature’s deposit growth as a result.      “This is now the fourth consecutive quarter exceeding $1 billion in both total and average deposit growth, non-interest bearing deposits of $16.1 billion still represent a high 32% of total deposits since the second quarter of last year,” DePaolo said on an earnings call on Tuesday.      The cost of those deposits also decreased to 56 basis points from 98 basis points because of the low interest rate environment, the CEO added. For the sake of improving profitability, the bank wants to get the cost of deposits down around 40 basis points, the CEO said.      The company’s executive vice president of corporate and business development, Eric Howell, commented on the earnings call that the bank’s net interest margin will be up if the bank gets back to a more “stable” deposit growth of between $500 million to $1 billion a quarter.      The bank earned around $117 million in second quarter 2020, a significant decrease from the $147 million in second quarter 2019 after putting up a provision for credit losses of $93 million this last quarter.      Notably, the bank made Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to nine crypto companies.    Signet growth    Custody provider Copper announced on Monday that it had integrated with the bank’s blockchain payments platform, Signet.      The integration means Copper clients like crypto exchanges will now get to use Signet for faster payments and settlement times in U.S. dollar transactions.      “Previously, the process of paying and settling transactions was far more complex,” Copper CEO Dmitry Tokarev said in an emailed statement. “In order to route fiat currencies, customers had to go from their exchange account, back to Signature Bank, then back to their exchange account. Now, both fiat and digital assets can be moved within the Copper platform.”      Copper offers multi-signature custody and prime brokerage to its clients. This is provided by Copper’s Walled Garden infrastructure, giving clients access to trading facilities without taking digital assets out of custody.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/23/signature-banks-crypto-deposits-grew-1b-in-q2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/529bca0429dd58d74ed5af749ac6b629b6aecccf-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

George Clayton, managing partner of New York-based Cryptanalysis Capital, expects it to go much higher. “We are bullish and higher prices are better for us, but the rise is really no big deal,” he said.      Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital, pointed out The Fear and Greed index added 5 points at once and is in the “greed” zone. “Bitcoin has risen above the psychologically important $9,500 mark. This indicates a positive sentiment from investors,” Kogan told CoinDesk.      A short squeeze in the cryptocurrency derivatives market may have helped to accelerate the price rise. Over the past week, some $61 million of short positions were liquidated, outweighing the $18 million of long liquidations on derivatives exchange BitMEX. As the short sellers got squeezed, bitcoin moved to $9,400 Tuesday, and then over $9,500 on Thursday. “Big levels are being tackled,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5.      Adi Yona of algorithm trading firm Efficient Frontier noted payments companies like PayPal jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon as more bullish sentiment. “Bitcoin has jumped in its last move. Paypal’s 325 million users could buy and sell bitcoins. This could have a major impact on volume and pricing as the crypto markets open up to new populations.”      Read More: PayPal Picks Paxos to Supply Crypto for New Service, Sources Say      BitBull’s Kogan also noted the performance of gold Thursday.

Jack Tan, CEO of Taiwan-based Kronos Research, expects $300 ether soon. “It's a continued bullish trend in my view, I would take profits around low-mid $300s.”      The total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) surpassed the $3 billion mark July 21, according to information from aggregator DeFi Pulse. The total value, at $3.37 billion Thursday, has quintupled since the start of 2020.      Stablecoin project Maker leads DeFi projects with $718 million in value locked. Lenders Aave and Compound follow with $560 million and $547 million, respectively. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) Synthetix, with $483 million locked, and Curve, with $342 million locked, round out the top five.

42432430,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCM1h,1595530772,Wyoming-Based Avanti to Open in October With a New Bank-Issued Digital Asset,"Avanti Financial expects to open its doors this October with a new bank-issued digital asset.      Led by Wyoming blockchain advocate Caitlin Long, the crypto-friendly bank announced Thursday its application was accepted by the Wyoming Division of Banking on July 15. Avanti will open in the fall because the regulator accelerated the timeline of its application process.      In the same announcement, Avanti revealed its plans to issue Avit, a programmable digital asset that can only be issued by banks and will be treated as a cash equivalent. With Blockstream as the bank’s technology partner, Long said in an interview that “one could presume that the Bitcoin blockchain will be involved,” but could not comment further.      Read more: Caitlin Long’s Avanti Raises $5M, Submits Wyoming Bank Charter Application Draft      If Avanti’s charter application is approved in October, the bank will be the only financial institution capable of issuing Avit. While Avit would not be pegged one-to-one to the U.S. dollar – because it’s a new digital asset, not a digital representation of a real-world asset – the currency would be 100% backed by a reserve of liquid traditional U.S. assets. (The bank requires this reserve for all the assets it custodies.)      Avanti claims Avit will not have the same delayed settlement and chargeback issues that traditional fiat payments face. Because an automated clearing house (ACH) transaction can be reversed several weeks after a payment has been made, exchanges and other asset service providers often hold traders’ cash for several days, Long said.      “There’s a lot of counterparty risk in OTC trading of digital assets,” Long said. “Everyone wants to settle second. What we’re doing is offering the ability for both sides to settle simultaneously.”      The bank also claims Avit will not have the legal, accounting or tax issues associated with stablecoins.      “No one knows the legal enforceability of digital assets in the U.S. because they fall through the cracks,” Long said. “The legal clarity of all stableicons is not there. Tax and accounting is also far from clear.”      Read more: Banks in US Can Now Offer Crypto Custody Services, Regulator Says      Long argued that despite the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) letter clarifying that U.S. banks may provide crypto custody, the special purpose depository institution in Wyoming is still the most advanced framework for crypto custody in the U.S.      “The OCC and 49 other states do not yet have in place the comprehensive legal structure necessary for enabling digital asset custody without significant legal risk,” Long said in a press statement, adding:      “They also do not have a roadmap for courts to adjudicate disputes involving digital assets and do not provide the certainty in bankruptcy that Wyoming provides for digital asset custodians. Its prudential standards make Wyoming the only jurisdiction in the U.S. where digital asset custody in a bank can truly be executed in a safe and sound manner.”      The Wyoming Division of Banking did not return a request for comment by press time.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/23/wyoming-based-avanti-to-open-in-october-with-a-new-bank-issued-digital-asset,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/999910a827468485908406673004df45751dcbc7-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Georgia-based Watchdog Capital said Thursday that issuers would be able to use Gladius to offer security tokens.  In a statement, Watchdog said Gladius could provide companies with more access to capital as well as better opportunities for investors.  Gladius, which has been built to be compatible with existing U.S. securities laws, is currently in beta mode.  Bruce Fenton, CEO of Watchdog's parent Chainstone Labs, told CoinDesk Gladius plans to host the first offering in the next three months.  As Watchdog is a registered broker-dealer, Fenton said Gladius can be used for SEC-exempted offerings, including crowdfunds.  Watchdog has to approve each offering; certain Reg A offerings may also need approval from the SEC.  The broker-dealer does not have the appropriate licenses to offer secondary trading or custodial services on Gladius.  The platform is blockchain-agnostic and can also be used to issue paper equity – investors can either pay in fiat or cryptocurrencies.  Fenton said his company believes it's the only broker-dealer launching such a platform in the U.S. at this time.  He added that security tokens may well open up a new regulated investment avenue for companies in the decentralized finance space.

42432431,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCM3h,1595522329,YouTube Seeks to Dismiss Ripple Lawsuit Over XRP Giveaway Scams,"In a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Ripple, YouTube argues it isn’t liable for crypto scammers using its platform.      The motion filed on Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, argues that under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, “interactive computer services,” like YouTube, cannot be treated as publishers of third-party content and hence aren’t liable for it.    Ripple had sued YouTube in April, alleging the video-sharing platform did not sufficiently control XRP giveaway scams on its platform that caused monetary loss for users and hurt Ripple’s reputation.   The crypto firm’s lawsuit alleged that scammers have defrauded “millions of XRP valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars” from victims and cited at least one instance where a scammer apparently received $15,000 in XRP from a victim.   In its motion to dismiss the lawsuit, YouTube argues Ripple's claims run up against immunity provided against such lawsuits to online publishers under Section 230. The motion said Ripple has filed the lawsuit “even though YouTube itself is a victim of the scam,” since the attackers took over user accounts on the platform.   YouTube’s motion to dismiss the allegations boils down to the idea that the video-sharing giant did not willingly or knowingly engage in any of the scams or copyright infringement, and cannot be held liable for any third-party content on its website. The firm’s motion also adds that it shut down such scams whenever it was alerted to them.   Responding to allegations that YouTube also helped scammers advertise their schemes by running paid ads for them, the video sharing giant’s motion to dismiss maintained that it could not be held liable for third-party content. “And whether YouTube ‘approved’ or ‘endorsed’ the ads by allowing them to be published is immaterial,” the motion noted.   YouTube argues that Section 230 protects the video-sharing giant from Ripple’s allegations and therefore the case should be dismissed. A Ripple representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on YouTube’s motion to dismiss.   In another lawsuit filed against YouTube, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak alleged the firm had allowed bitcoin giveaway scams that use his likeness to thrive on its platform. Wozniak, along with 18 other plaintiffs, is seeking punitive damages and demanding that Youtube take down all such scams as well.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BTC | XRP | AIRDROP,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/23/youtube-seeks-to-dismiss-ripple-lawsuit-over-xrp-giveaway-scams,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64abe119ab4883376b3e845350a95a78d39a298f-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432425,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCLrh,1595520911,Russia's FSB Is Making Life Harder for Blockchain Companies,"The Takeaway:    Enterprise blockchain solutions in Russia have to get their cryptographic elements certification with the FSB, the counter-espionage agency.  The process can take several years to complete and up to $100,000.  Some foreign-developed blockchains can’t satisfy the requirement without a fork.  Russian-made systems might end up isolated from the global market due to distrust of Russian government cryptography standards.    Blockchain technology was created to be borderless. But in the real world, borders still impose limits on this technology.      Everything related to cryptography in Russia falls under the supervision of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, which is the successor to the KGB. The FSB has a certification process for blockchain companies, which might cost over $100,000 and take more than a year, according to experts on the Russian enterprise blockchain market.      Last year, the Fintech Association, a consortium helmed by the Bank of Russia, reported obtaining the certification for Masterchain, its blockchain for banks. The process took about three years to complete, and it’s still not the end of story.      Read more: ‘Disappointed’ by Central Bank Blockchain, Russia’s Largest Bank Eyes Alternatives      The Fintech Association is working on getting another certificate from the FSB, this time for a particular product on Masterchain. Going forward, any new iteration and implementation of the code using cryptographic elements needs to go through this process.      Other Russian enterprise blockchain projects, including Waves and Bitfury’s Exonum, are still working on getting certified as well – and they also may need more than a year.      The FSB’s certification process is challenging the borderless feature of blockchain technology in two ways. Globally, Russia is trying to get the cryptographic community to accept its encryption algorithm as a standard. Inside the country, the blockchain industry is trying to figure out what to do with a product that foreign partners might be reluctant to adopt.    Unofficial must    While there is no law directly stating that blockchain companies must be certified by the FSB, companies have strong incentives to do so. First, according to Russian law, documents that are signed electronically must use state-certified electronic signatures to be legally binding documents.      “If we’re talking about financial services, certification is a must, otherwise the transactions between [blockchain system] participants won’t have any legal significance. And the digital signature should be built into the blockchain system,” explained Anatoly Konkin, head of DLT at the Fintech Association.      Certification also could help convince big clients, in particular government agencies in Russia, that the system you’re building is secure, says Ivan Maslov, Bitfury’s head of development in Russia.      Read more: Waves and the Tricky Task of Being a Russian Crypto Brand      “If you are creating a system for a government body, it must be certified,” Maslov said.      “It’s an additional competitive advantage for [enterprise blockchain] vendors, which allows them to promise that the system will satisfy all the security requirements,” said Dmitri Plakhov, head of the technical committee of the Center for Distributed Ledger Tech at the Saint Petersburg State University.      The situation is not unique to Russia, notes Sasha Ivanov, CEO of Waves: “Using local cryptography for government-level blockchain projects is a reality that we will have to deal with, be it Russian, Chinese, or Western projects.”      The certification process in Europe, he adds, might take less time than in Russia, but the principle is the same.    Russian standard    For blockchain companies, however, the FSB certification process brings special challenges. Blockchain technology is supposed to be a transparent, agile and auditable system, but having certified cryptographic modules raises questions about transparency and reliability.      The easiest way to comply with the FSB requirements is to use a solution from a licensed vendor – but the code of such solutions is not open source and can not be audited. This is not obligatory, and Masterchain, for example, is using its own cryptography elements, Konkin said. However, an FSB-licensed company named Crypto PRO has been supervising the entire creation of Masterchain.      CryptoPRO is also one of the licensed providers of the GOST (GOvernment STandard) cryptography solutions certified by the FSB.      Bitfury’s Maslov explains that to get Exonum compatible with the requirements of Russian government bodies that the company is working with, Bitfury used software made by one of the FSB-certified providers. The software is responsible for data encryption, hashing and securing channels for the nodes to connect, Maslov said, but it’s up to the blockchain architect to decide what functions should be used.      The process is far from transparent. When a company gets a document from the FSB saying its product is now certified, most of that document is classified.      If the blockchain solution is open source, its certified version won’t be. For example, the certified version of Bitfury’s Exonum will not be open source, even though Exonum itself is, Maslov said. “The open code can not be certified. You need to certify a certain version of it, but if somebody can change it with one click, it’s hard to control this,” he adds.      Read more: Moscow Said to Hire Kaspersky to Build Voting Blockchain With Bitfury Software      Furthermore, the certification process is complicated by the need to check not just the code, but also its implementations. Even though Masterchain was already certified as a platform, it also had to get a separate certificate for each app it’s building on top, Konkin said. For one of these apps, which stores digital mortgage bonds, the certification is already complete. But for another one, the inter-bank letter of credit project, the process is still ongoing.      The certification touches every part of the blockchain architecture. Artem Kalikhov, Wave Enterprise director of product, explained that the certification process entails the entire architecture of the blockchain being scrutinized. This includes “not just the use of the cryptographic functions, but also the information security, correctness of the consensus algorithm. Different threat models for the system must be studied.”      The task gets further complicated by the fact that the FSB hasn’t dealt with blockchain systems before, excluding Masterchain, and it has to grapple with the novel concepts of blockchain architecture.      “Now they are figuring out blockchain, consensus, smart contracts,” Kalikhov said.      The certification process requires quite a lot of company resources. Normally, two or more people in the company need to work on it full time, writing the technical papers and communicating with the FSB, Maslov said. The product that’s getting certified basically gets frozen for the period of certification, and any updates need to go through the process again, he said.    A game of algorithms    The FSB certification requires international blockchain companies to use Russian standards, but those Russian standards could be viewed with suspicion abroad.      Historically, Russia has maintained its own cryptographic standard, the so-called GOST, as did China, staying clear of the global market of cryptographic solutions and not trusting foreigners to sell them encryption tools.      This strategy was vindicated by stories such as that of Crypto AG, a Swiss code machine manufacturer, which turned out to be controlled by the NSA for decades and sold compromised machines across the globe, as the Washington Post reported.      The certification process also makes it harder for global blockchain projects to make it in Russia.      “Cryptographic algorithms created abroad can’t be recognized as legitimate in Russia by the law,” Alexey Lukatsky, security advisor at CISCO, said. “According to the FSB requirements, a cryptographic solution developer should be based in Russia and have a license from FSB, which is unfeasible for foreign companies.”      Yet another problem is that Russian certification could cause blockchain projects to be cut off from the global developer community.    “There are no platforms, and won’t be any, where you can build the Russian cryptography in and keep the full tech support available before,” CryptoPRO’s engineer Dmitri Pichulin told CoinDesk.    Currently, most blockchain solutions are based on the hashing algorithms built upon the Advanced encryption standard, or AES, established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.      For internationally recognized standards, there are multiple libraries that developers can use, while for national standards, there are less opportunities to build upon freely. Libraries for GOST are harder to find, a cybersecurity expert Sergey Prilutsky says.      For example, there is no GOST library for the Go language, which is used to build on Hyperledger Fabric, Prilutsky said. “So the devs have to transfer [their code] from C++ to Go. But in this case, there is a danger to introduce serious vulnerabilities into a system,” he added.      In addition, the GOST crypto algorithm itself has been viewed with apprehension by the global cryptographic community. When the algorithm, named Kuznyechik (“grasshopper” in Russian), was presented to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) last summer, it got a cold reception, Vice reported, as the experts from other countries found potential vulnerabilities in the cipher.      According to the French cryptographer Pascal Paillier, the research has shown that “the Russian standards may contain what looks like a backdoor, which, if confirmed, would allow Russia to be able to break the confidentiality of communications,” he told Vice.    No more Fabric?    Blockchain products with foreign roots might get pushed out of the Russian market. Take the example of Hyperledger Fabric by IBM. Hyperledger has been the most popular framework for enterprise blockchain, and the giants like the Russian Railways, Sberbank and Gazpromneft used it as a platform of choice for blockchain proof-of-concepts. But maybe not anymore.      Previously, there was a way to build the GOST cryptography into Fabric without forking it – which is, without making it incompatible with the main branch code – by using plugins, and CryptoPRO even created some for Russian companies to use. However, the most recent version of Fabric, released late January, no longer supports plugins.      Read more: Meet the Russian Oligarch Launching a Metal-Backed Crypto Token      IBM engineer Chris Ferris, who is the сhair of Hyperledger's Technical Steering Committee, said via a spokesperson that it’s still possible to build in an alternative cryptography but “it would require a recompile of the binaries.” As for the plugins, supporting them “was not sustainable and required significant work-arounds to manage dependencies,” Ferris added.      There is also an opening for Russian developers to find a way to securely build the GOST cryptography into Fabric and provide quality tech support and regular code updates, essentially replacing the Hyperledger community.      Some companies have been working on commercial forks of Hyperledger Fabric already. One of them is CryptoPRO, which has already added its forked version, named CryptoPRO HLF 1.0, to the national software register.      It’s not a commercial product yet, Pichulin says, but it might become one. “The demand is there, tech support and updates are on our agenda.”      Still, the challenge of certification, combined with Russia’s law demanding that all Russian’s data be stored inside the country, might further insulate Russia from the global technology market.      Cryptographic elements are rooted deep in any product’s core, which makes systems based on different standards incompatible, Prilutsky says.      He added:    “The open-source solutions based on Western [cryptographic] standards, available in hundreds of countries, can’t be used in Russia because of the certification requirements, and the blockchains with Russian cryptography are a non-starter for the global market players – they are not trusted.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/23/russias-fsb-is-making-life-harder-for-blockchain-companies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c74febfc578d0c708b14225dda121f80de7c86c-1200x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top shelf    Digital Dollar Hegemony The U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Policy conducted a hearing on “Winning the Economic Competition” between China and the U.S. on Wednesday where crypto was cited as a possible tool to maintain U.S. economic supremacy. “This could be interpreted as crypto’s increasing acceptance as a mainstream idea,” CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De says. Former CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo once again called for the U.S. conduct pilot programs using a tokenized dollar. “We have to assume that as the nature of finance changes, the nature of currencies change, we have to stay at the leading edge,” Walter Russell Mead, the James Clarke Chace Professor of Foreign Affairs and Humanities at Bard College and a member of the Hudson Institute, said.      'The Future of Money' Visa outlined a digital currency playbook Wednesday, showing its commitment to digital currency’s place in “the future of money.” Already a crypto bridge for tens of millions of merchants, Visa cast its digital currency partnerships as critical to preserving what it said was six decades of innovation. “Extending this legacy into the decades ahead requires continuous innovation and collaboration with” the public and private sector, it said.      Near the Net? Brooklyn Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie’s plan to tokenize part of his $34 million NBA contract fell short of its $13.5 million target. Dinwiddie’s issuer SD26 LLC sold just nine of the 90 available tokenized contract shares, priced at $150,000, to eight total investors as of Wednesday, according to CoinDesk’s review of Form D regulatory filings and the security’s token’s issuance history on Etherscan. Project insiders have previously said the sale would last only until the end of July. It now appears to be closed out for good. Dinwiddie first proposed tokenizing his three-year contract in September 2019, which was initially met with fierce opposition from the NBA.      Ant's Assets Ant Group claims its clients are uploading an average of 100 million digital assets to its distributed ledger every day, making it the largest operating blockchain in China. The Alibaba-affiliate company made the claim in a release Thursday that announced Ant Blockchain was rebranding to AntChain. An Ant spokesperson later told CoinDesk these were mostly transaction records, as well as copyright and property ownership certificates. Ant Group said this week it was planning an IPO on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges at a rumored $200 billion valuation.      Compromised Accounts The attackers who compromised Twitter in a massive breach last week may have accessed direct messages from up to 36 accounts, including CoinDesk’s, according to an announcement late Wednesday. Twitter said it has completed its review of the 130 accounts targeted by the hack, which garnered $120,000 through a crypto giveaway scam. The attackers were not able to see previous passwords, but were able to access email addresses, phone numbers and possible “additional information,” the update said. CoinDesk has yet to regain access to its primary account.

In a letter yesterday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced all nationally chartered banks in the U.S. will be able to provide custody services for cryptocurrencies.      This marks a major turning point for the crypto industry, long reliant on specialist custodians, typically licensed through states, to offer services to large investors. But it also signals a changing attitude in the nature of money.      “The OCC recognizes that, as the financial markets become increasingly technological, there will likely be increasing need for banks and other service providers to leverage new technology and innovative ways to provide traditional services on behalf of customers,” the letter said.      Brian Brooks, a former Coinbase exec who joined the OCC as Acting Comptroller earlier this year, is just one of a number of crypto-friendly regulators in high positions. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton is likely to become the next U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, while ‘Crypto Mom’ Hester Peirce has been tapped for a second term as an SEC commissioner.      It’s not out of the question for more crypto-forward legislation or administrative actions to follow this year.      Still, the growing governmental acceptance of crypto comes with costs. Banks custodying digital assets will have to conform to local laws and follow “sound risk management practices,” the OCC letter states, placing these assets under watchful eyes.      Whether this is antithetical to crypto’s original ethos, or may stifle breakneck development is an open question. But it’s worth asking what “being your own bank” means.    Market intel    'Risk On' Bitcoin jumped above $9,500 on Wednesday, ending a four-week-long low-volatility squeeze. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole said market sentiment is poised for a further rise to the psychologically important $10,000 price level. In particular, a “risk-on” mood in traditional markets – seen by five-month highs in global stocks and near-term lows for the U.S. dollar, a safe haven in times of crisis – supports the case for a bullish crypto market. Bitcoin has recently developed a strong correlation with traditional assets.    Tech pod    Testing, Testing Ethereum 2.0 developers released the specifications for the “official” testnet on Wednesday, ahead of a presumed end-of-year launch. The testnet will begin August 4 and has been named “Medalla” after a Buenos Aires metro stop. In this case, “official” means the testnet is deployed by the Ethereum Foundation (EF), which will run by a decentralized group of programmers, developers and code auditors organized by fork coordinator Afri Schoedon. This is also a signpost the network’s code base is nearing launch readiness. Medalla joins multiple prior tests of Eth 2.0’s code bank on various client implementations, including Görli, Witti, Schlesi and most recently Altona.      Crypto on the Backend Orchid VPN announced the launch of a Mac desktop app for private web browsing, which will allow users to purchase bandwidth using an Apple ID. The Ethereum-based service “marks one of the first times consumers can exchange USD for a service that runs entirely on crypto in the background,” Orchid CEO Steven “Seven” Waterhouse told CoinDesk via a spokesperson. Apple has traditionally taken an anti-crypto stance, including banning mining applications. “At minimum, Orchid’s arrangement with the Cupertino tech giant represents a slick workaround,” CoinDesk’s Zack Seward reports.      What Went Wrong Blocknative, a company that studies blockchain mempools, issued a report that may explain the ""zero-bid"" attack on MakerDAO on March 12, also known as Black Thursday. The company found that an unusually high proportion of the mempool was clogged by transactions with very low gas prices, “hammering” the system with transactions never meant to go through. This opened the doors for hackers to submit “zero bids” in MakerDAO’s collateral auctions with stronger gas prices, essentially netting them collateralized ETH for $0. The attackers walked away with $8.3 million.    Opinion    Embrace the Unknowable Intelligence Jesus Rodriguez, CEO of IntoTheBlock, thinks crypto should embrace OpenAI’s new GPT-3 language generator model, not fear it. Noting that GPT-3, which is able to respond to human prompts, does not pose consequences for crypto, it could be employed in developing new quantitative trading and on-chain analysis strategies, as well as find a home in decentralized systems. “[T]he techniques behind GPT-3 represent the biggest advancement in deep learning in the last few years and, consequently, can become incredibly relevant to the analysis of crypto-assets,” he said.

Cambrian Asset Management, the manager of a quantitative cryptocurrency fund based in Marin County, Calif., raised $4 million in equity, the firm announced Thursday.  The seed funding round was led by Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, the family investment offices of Charles B. Johnson and Franklin Templeton, IVP general partner Dennis Phelps, and Business Insider and MongoDB co-founder Kevin P. Ryan, according to the fund.  ""Following the events of 2020, more investors are starting to look at digital assets because of their scarcity, as well as the value created by innovation that is orthogonal to the equity and credit markets,” Ryan said.  The money will support operations, research and development, and technology instead of growing managed assets. Morgan and Johnson are said to be deeply involved with advising Cambrian on these infrastructure plans.  Cambrian, which started investing with mid-single-digit millions of dollars in capital, now has $25 million under management and has outperformed the Bitwise 10 and Bletchley 10 passive cryptocurrency fund indices.  Former and current principals and executives from Goldman Sachs, UBS, The Carlyle Group, BNP Paribas, DRW, RGM, SAC Capital, Tata Capital, Standard Pacific Capital, Winton Capital, First Round Capital, Visium, Microsoft, Instagram, Airbnb, Pinterest and Fastly, as well as angel investors in Coinbase and Uber, also took part in the equity round, the fund said.  Cambrian co-founder and chief executive officer, Martin Green, co-chief investment officer and managing partner, Jay Posner, and head of engineering, P. Daniel Tyreus, launched the fund in November 2018.  Cambrian uses probabilistic algorithms, or computer programs developed on statistically focused models, to take long and short trading positions on large market capitalization cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin over several days or weeks rather than by the hour or minute.  To curb risk, the fund does not trade on margin with derivatives, options or futures.

42432436,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNCMDh,1595519863,Ether Stalls After 8% Rally as Exchange Inflows Spike,"Ether’s price gained on Wednesday but it is struggling to extend the rally. It may be due to a build of short-term selling pressure, as indicated by higher flows of ETH to exchanges.      The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value rose to $270 at around 23:00 UTC on Wednesday, marking a bullish breakout from the multi-week-long trading range of $225 to $250.      As such, some observers are expecting stronger gains. So far, however, the cryptocurrency has remained flatlined below $270.      One possible explanation for the weak follow-through to the bullish breakout could be the pick up in the inflow of ether into centralized exchanges observed after the cryptocurrency’s breakout. Investors or miners usually move coins from their wallets to crypto exchanges when they want to liquidate their investments.      So far Thursday, more than 135,000 ETH have been transferred to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. That is the highest single-day exchange inflow since June 5, according to Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm.      Read More: First Mover: Ethereum a Victim of Its Own Success as Fees Soar, Vitalik Complains      “The spike in the amount of ETH flowing into centralized exchanges suggests a rising selling pressure. Weak hands might be looking to cash in on the pump. So it's not surprising that ETH seems to have stabilized around $264 for the moment,” Dino Ibisbegovic, market analyst at Santiment, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      “Weak hands” is the term used to describe traders lacking confidence or resources to hold assets for long-term. Usually, it's the retail crowd which exits on minor price pumps or dumps. Hence, markets often consolidate or witness temporary price pullbacks following major breakouts like the one seen in ether.    Outflows from top 100 addresses    On-chain data show significant outflows from whale addresses. For instance, holdings of the top 100 ETH addresses have declined by 700,000 in the past three days.      In addition, miner balances have declined by 11,000 ETH to 1.163 million ETH since July 11, according to Santiment. However, in both the cases, it is difficult to gauge how much of the outflow went to exchanges.      It remains to be seen if ether faces selling pressure in the next few days due to the rise in the exchange inflows. “In the past, similar spikes have been recorded around local tops, suggesting capitulation,” Ibisbegovic said.      That said, it all depends on how strong the buying pressure is.

The alternative assets manager, founded in 2018, failed to attract many institutional investors during its two-year run and is shutting down completely, according to a report by Financial News.  Founded by BlackRock alumni, the firm became Britain's first approved crypto hedge fund in July 2019 when it secured a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) license to manage in excess of 100 million euros.  That wasn’t enough to lure big fish investors, however, and neither was the firm’s claim to deliver existing clients a 4% average monthly return, CEO Nic Niedermowwe told Financial News.

42384147,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA11zp,1595515736,Don't Expect Banks to Jump on the OCC Crypto Custody News,"Alex Mascioli is head of institutional services for Bequant, a digital asset prime broker. He spent nearly a decade in traditional financial markets before making the jump to crypto markets three years ago.      Banks can now offer cryptocurrency and digital asset custody to their clients, but what does this really mean?      As you may know, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced Wednesday that nationally chartered banks in the U.S. can now jump into the crypto custody arena. There are plenty of opinions about what impact this will have on the industry, and many of them are at odds.      See also: Banks in US Can Now Offer Crypto Custody Services, Regulator Says      Some feel this is the beginning of a new era for the industry where banks will be able to offer complimentary digital asset services attractive to sophisticated investors; or, even more optimistically, that a Bitcoin ETF is more likely to be approved. Others have lamented that banks will audit and tax every penny, or, even worse, that they will readily agree to help the federal government seize coins in the future.      Here’s the thing. Traditional financial institutions, banks included, move slowly. Most make turtles look like they’re in a hurry. So, don’t expect any to announce their brand new custody platform immediately, if at all.    According to a recent Fidelity surveyhttps://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FDAS/institutional-investor-study.pdf, only about a third of all these firms even own crypto.    Think about that for a second.      Many investors in this space are here because they are weary of being exposed to the systemic risk that having digital assets custodied in a traditional financial institution could create. They are hedging against the very network that’s trying to encroach on Bitcoin.    The bulk of banks and other sophisticated players in the old school markets don’t know much about our industry.    Given this unusual (and vocal) segment of our industry, banks may not have quite the opportunity they think they do, and a significant share of crypto asset traders and investors may avoid them altogether and stick with crypto native firms that are somewhat insulated from the potential problems of a Northern Trust or a State Street, both of which are large traditional custodians that took TARP bailout funds during the Great Recession.      The bulk of banks and other sophisticated players in the old school markets don’t know much about our industry. Most of them don’t appear to have even done anything as basic as buying a fractional Bitcoin on Robinhood.      Some firms have even publicly frowned upon bitcoin. For example, just this past May, Goldman Sachs said in a widely publicized research note that “cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are not an asset class.”      Comments like those don’t appear to be aging well, and are important because they show the fundamental lack of experience and understanding of digital asset markets that at least some of these firms have. Sure, their reach and distribution is huge, but what does that matter if they don't have the knowledge or relationships to build such an offering?      It isn’t all negative, though. There are positives that can be taken away from this announcement.      When former Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Brian Brooks became the acting head of the OCC, his office announced he wanted banks to submit input on crypto rule policies, this was a major change from the previous head. Additionally, now that nationally chartered banks can officially do business as a crypto custodian, this will legitimize digital assets to more people, both on the retail consumer side and institutionally. I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw a jump in values for many of the more well-known crypto assets over the coming days and weeks.      See also: Byrne Hobart - PTJ on BTC: Bitcoin Is Now the Macro Big Bet      Paul Tudor Jones, one of the most successful and well known hedge fund managers in the world, recently made news by making public his intention to include bitcoin futures in response to an “unprecedented expansion of every form of money unlike anything the developed world has ever seen,” and what he sees as “the upcoming digitization of money everywhere, accelerated by COVID-19.”      He can’t be the only member of the old guard starting to see the value and practicality of bitcoin and other crypto assets.      More than likely, this will be a catalyst of sorts for an acceleration of clarity from Washington regarding a more solid regulatory framework for our industry (also good). All too often, the clarity of what we can or can’t do seems to shift with the winds. Hopefully, this is the beginning of a trickle-down effect. Maybe this announcement is our stabilizer, maybe Brian Brooks is the even-keeled captain that we need to move forward.      Once all the headlines surrounding this announcement fade away, what will we be left with? Probably not many new custodial entrants from this regulatory approval in the short term, but the bright hope that the onlookers will see the acknowledgement from our government that crypto is real, at least real enough for the house that Morgan built to be allowed to do business with it.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Alex Mascioli,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/23/dont-expect-banks-to-jump-on-the-occ-crypto-custody-news,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33f2b0f05b2cdd6245aac8f7c1978649775ad773-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384158,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA12CP,1595512464,EU Privacy Shield Ruling Is an Opportunity and Conundrum for Decentralized Tech,"Last week the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) struck down a key data-sharing agreement between the United States and European Union, with possible implications for U.S. blockchain companies that serve EU customers.      The 2016 agreement, known as the Privacy Shield, lets American companies self-certify they are complying with data privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Act (GDPR). GDPR gives end users greater control over data held by companies including Google and Facebook.      Steven Blickensderfer, a technology and privacy lawyer at the firm Carlton Fields, said the decision dramatically alters how companies can process data, and impacts not just the U.S. but other countries with robust surveillance including China and Russia.      “The court’s imploring data protection authorities in Europe to no longer sit idly by while illegal transfers of data are taking place,” he said. “The court has called the data protections supervisor to action.”      Companies handling a European’s personal data are supposed to share only that data with entities in countries that have similar protections. The U.S. lacks strong federal privacy legislation, and has a long history of security agencies like the National Security Agency secretly surveilling vast swathes of personal data, under legally dubious justifications. When a person in the EU uses a service like Facebook or Google, they are sending their data outside of the EU.    Next steps for companies    Over 5,000 U.S. companies were certified under the Privacy Shield deal, including Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Google, meaning they may now have to take extensive steps to figure out how to protect EU customers data, and comply with GDPR in other ways. This is a challenge for smaller-sized companies, said Blickensderfer, considering the measures needed to account for data and the number of third parties involved.      One alternative is to make sure users give informed consent, so their data is processed in the U.S. and personal data may be used for commercial purposes. But, said Blickensderfer, it’s doubtful that existing terms of service cover that. Another options is reviewing the standard contract language, making more explicit how, for example, the U.S. government may access data.      Prominent cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase was certified under the Privacy Shield. When asked what the impact on their EU customers might be and what exchanges and blockchain companies should be looking to as an alternative, it said nothing had changed for now.      “We have been monitoring developments regarding the EU/U.S. Privacy Shield closely and, in light of the CJEU’s recent decision, we will continue to use approved data transfer mechanisms...to ensure Coinbase provides services to customers in the EU without interruption,"" said a Coinbase spokesperson.      See also: EU Creating a Regulatory Regime for Cryptocurrencies, Says Economic Chief      Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer and activist, brought the case to the CJEU over concerns about the legality of how Facebook was using his data. The court found that U.S. surveillance laws clash with fundamental EU rights.      ""This judgment is not the cause of a limit to data transfers, but the consequence of U.S. surveillance laws,” Schrems said in a statement. “You can’t blame the Court for saying the unavoidable - when shit hits the fan, you can’t blame the fan.""      Confusingly, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement the Department of Commerce will continue to administer the Privacy Shield program, including processing submissions for self-certification, recertification to the Privacy Shield Frameworks and maintaining the Privacy Shield List. All this despite the fact the program was invalidated immediately on the EU side, and therefore seemingly contains little value.      “That's the big unstated response to this statement by the Secretary of Commerce,” said Blickensderfer. “Why would you want to remain in this program if you are not getting the benefits it otherwise provided to you?”      Ross said he was disappointed in the decision and hoped to “limit the negative consequences to the $7.1 trillion transatlantic economic relationship.”    Enter privacy tech    Companies that use privacy-oriented technology and include features like end-to-end encryption, may have an easier time complying with the new reality, according to Blickensderfer.      “Decentralized tech and tools like blockchain can help establish the existence of sufficient protections – or ‘supplementary measures,’ to borrow from the Court’s opinion – to ensure the adequacy of the protections necessary to satisfy the GDPR,” he said.      At the same time, GDPR compliance presents a challenge to those technologies because of the seemingly unavoidable conflict between immutability on the one hand and the right to be forgotten, or to restrict processing, on the other.      In “cross-border transfers under the GDPR, these technologies can certainly help,” Blickensderfer said. “But there are other potential unavoidable conflicts ... when considering wholesale adoption of this technology to demonstrate GDPR compliance.”      See also: Look to Design, Not Laws, to Protect Privacy in the Surveillance Age      End-to-end encryption prevents state surveillance apparatuses from compelling companies to access and share that data with them. Additionally, decentralized tech doesn’t have a centralized point of control, meaning there are very few ways for one actor to brute force access all the information on the network or protocol.      Raullen Chai, CEO of IoTex, which leverages blockchain to secure the internet of things, said people who want to preserve their privacy have had little option but to rely on permissive corporate policies and ineffectual regulations.      “At the heart of the problem is data ownership,” said Chai. “Decentralization offers a way to stop storing data centrally and allow individual people and entities to own their data.”      Huang Lin, CTO of Suterusu, which is working to develop privacy protection over smart contracts, transactions and data for blockchain networks, said a new transatlantic data transfer framework giving individuals more control over their data privacy is urgently needed.      “The current trend on private data transfer regulation exemplified by European GDPR is that data will be more and more governed according to digital code,” he said. “In a word, code is the law.”      In the next few years, he sees scalable smart contract platforms actively adopting a variety of advanced cryptographic technologies. Zero-knowledge proofs, or protocols that allow data to be shared without a password, or any information associated with the transaction, is one such technology.      Another is secure multi-party computation, in which a number of separate yet connected computing devices carry out a joint computation without knowing the other inputs, just the outputs. This method protects against intrusion because there is no trusted third party that handles all the data involved.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/23/eu-privacy-shield-ruling-is-an-opportunity-and-conundrum-for-decentralized-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66e26cb8aff863129dbf32a7c0f64208af35269d-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384161,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA12GB,1595509858,"First Mover: Ethereum a Victim of Its Own Success as Fees Soar, Vitalik Complains","Rising congestion on the Ethereum blockchain has driven up transaction fees tenfold this year to the highest since early 2018.      That's pressuring the network's developers to speed up crucial upgrades, while possibly creating an opening for competitors to lure away project developers.      It's a lucky problem to have, since the congestion shows just how popular Ethereum has become as an ecosystem within the cryptocurrency realm.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The ether token's market capitalization, at roughly $27 billion, is just one-sixth of the older and larger bitcoin's. Yet, Ethereum dominates some of the fastest-growing parts of the industry, including dollar-linked ""stablecoins "" like tether (USDT) and the automatic lending systems of ""decentralized finance,"" or DeFi.      Now, however, the elevated transaction fees are raising concerns among some cryptocurrency analysts and investors who fret that Ethereum developers could be months or even years away from a fix, with no clear end in sight to the surging traffic.      A handful of alternative networks aiming to be ""Ethereum killers"" have emerged over the years. None have achieved that aim so far, but prohibitively high fees could present an opportunity for Ethereum's more scalable rivals.      ""It's good because people want to use Ethereum, but the counter-signal is that it can't necessarily handle all this usage, and therein lies the opportunity to provide an alternative,"" Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at the cryptocurrency data firm Messari, said in a phone interview.      The episode underscores a nagging question for the entire industry – whether cryptocurrencies are ready for mass adoption by consumers or investors.      The network ""continues to suffer from some scaling issues, which are becoming more problematic as it grows,"" says Rich Rosenblum, a former managing director of the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs who now leads the markets group at the cryptocurrency firm GSR.      Under the rules of the Ethereum network, users can offer to pay a higher fee rate to get their transactions processed faster. So when there's lots of activity, the fee rates can quickly spiral upward.      According to Coin Metrics, the average cost per transaction has climbed to a 7-day average of about 91 cents, from about 8 cents at the start of 2020.      Ethereum's fees are calculated using a base unit called ""gas,"" and are charged for any use of the network for activities such as smart contract execution.      ""As of now, high gas fees are keeping smaller players from being able to participate in some of DeFi’s most interesting protocols, such as Synthetix,"" said Digital Assets Data's Connor Abendschein.      Ethereum's dilemma would be easily recognized by even a B-rate CEO from the old-world economy: High prices invite competition; it's great to own the golden goose – just don't kill the golden goose.      As noted by the website Eth Gas Station, which tracks fees on the network, ""The long-term success of Ethereum depends on a healthy and efficient market for the price of gas.""      Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sounded his own warning on Monday when he noted in a tweet that transaction fees now represent nearly half of the rewards that cryptocurrency miners get from confirming new data blocks on the network.      ""This actually risks making Ethereum *less* secure,"" he tweeted. ""Fee market reform fixes this.""      The problem, according to some analysts and investors, is that a fix isn't likely until later this year or well into 2021, and is just one of many upgrades. There's no clear consensus on how to reform the fees, and the network is already driving toward a major overhaul known as Ethereum 2.0 that already has been pushed back several times.      According to a Coin Metrics report last week, the high fees could make the network prohibitively expensive for applications like gaming and collectibles that depend on large numbers of low-cost transactions.      ""The reason Ethereum has been so successful for distributed applications is its low cost,"" Gavin Smith, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Panxora, said Monday in a phone interview. ""The whole idea was that each transaction is a microtransaction. If you're paying a large fee every time, it's no longer practical.""      Prices for ether, the native token of the Ethereum network, have risen 105% this year, a performance that dwarfs bitcoin's 32% climb.      Ether's performance in digital-asset markets reflects traders' bets that the Ethereum blockchain will continue to see high usage. But from the perspective of users, the token's higher dollar price just makes the fees look that much more expensive.      ""Ethereum's scaling solutions couldn't come any sooner,"" Messari's Watkins said.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,514 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,551 | 24-Hr Low: $9,322      Trend: Bitcoin's month-long low volatility price squeeze has ended with a bullish break that could power the cryptocurrency higher to $10,000.      The top cryptocurrency by market value had been largely trading in the narrow range of $9,480–$9,000 in the four weeks to July 21. As a result, bitcoin's price volatility, as represented by Bollinger bands, had narrowed to levels last seen in March 2019.      Bitcoin jumped over 1.5% on Wednesday and printed a UTC close above the upper Bollinger band, confirming a range breakout. Wednesday's UTC close also invalidated a bearish lower high at $9,480, created on July 8.      As such, one may anticipate a move higher to resistances lined up at $9,800 and $10,000.

The New York-based crypto project and its CEO, Reggie Middleton, filed a complaint Tuesday against T-Mobile accusing the company of ""gross negligence"" and failing to protect its customers.  Founded in 2014, Veritaseum is a peer-to-peer market platform that allows users to directly trade with one another.  The project hosted an initial coin offering (ICO) for its VERI token in April 2017.  It alerted investors that July that hackers had stolen 36,000 tokens (then around $8.6 million) who promptly dumped it all on an exchange.  Per Tuesday's filing, Veritaseum says hackers gained control of the phone belonging to Middleton in a SIM-swap attack – where a victim's phone number is transferred to another device.  Not only did attackers then have access to confidential information, such as passwords, they could also bypass two-factor authentication and drain Middleton of all of his cryptocurrency.  In the complaint, Veritaseum and Middleton say T-Mobile confirmed up to five unauthorized SIM swaps, including some months after being first alerted to the attack.  Veritaseum alleges that T-Mobile's ""gross negligence"" led to the hack and severely damaged Middleton's mental health.  It is accusing the phone carrier on one count of failing to protect its customer, one count of causing mental distress and on three counts of negligence.  Veritaseum and Middleton are calling for a jury trial and is suing for damages.  In 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Middleton, a former Huffington Post writer, of failing to register Veritaseum's ICO and spreading false information to investors.  The case was subsequently settled for $9.5 million last November.

The collaboration was announced Thursday.      The integration highlights Binance’s intention to create an alternate platform for Ethereum dapps, particularly aimed at the currently popular DeFi market. Chainlink provides data from on-and-off chain sources called oracles for decentralized applications (dapps). The network has integrated with numerous DeFi projects such as bZx over the first half of 2020.      As reported by CoinDesk, Binance released its smart contract platform’s white paper in April (it is currently gearing up for a mainnet release). The exchange said the platform was not meant to compete with Ethereum, the largest dapp blockchain by market capitalization at some $25 billion, but perhaps complement it. For example, BSC projects are interoperable with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

These new features combined with BSC’s existing metrics and characteristics make its compatibility with Ethereum an even more navigable two-way street: Dapps on BSC will work on Ethereum, but Dapps on Ethereum will likewise be able to migrate more easily to BSC.      “Chainlink takes a blockchain agnostic approach that allows the highest quality data providers to make its way onto advanced smart contract development platforms like Binance Smart Chain,” Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a private message.      Ethereum has a hefty head start though. The protocol saw its first notable DeFi project, MakerDAO, go live in 2015.

Now, the cryptocurrency looks set to climb toward the psychological hurdle of $10,000, as suggested by several factors.    1. Volatility returns  Bitcoin's high of $9,551 on Wednesday was its highest level since June 24, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  The gain has confirmed a Bollinger band breakout on the daily chart and opened the doors for a move of $400 or more on the higher side, as noted by Adrian Zdunczyk, CEO of trading community The BIRB Nest in a blog post.  Bollinger bands are volatility indicators placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving average.  They had recently narrowed to levels last seen in November 2018 as the cryptocurrency traded in the very restricted range of $9,000–$9,400.  A big move often follows a period of very low volatility.  2. Institutional interest rising  Open interest or open positions in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) – considered synonymous with institutional interest – jumped 15% to a one-month high of $452 million on Wednesday.  The metric has risen by 24% over the past three days alongside bitcoin’s uptick from $9,120 to $9,550, according to data source Skew.  Global open interest (as gauged by data from 12 major crypto derivatives exchanges) has risen above $4 billion for the first time since early March.  A price rally is said to have legs if it is accompanied by an uptick in open interest.  3. 'Risk-on' markets  The “risk-on” mood in the traditional markets further supports stronger gains for the leading cryptocurrency.  Global stock markets are trading at five-month highs while the U.S. dollar, a safe haven in times of crisis, is languishing near March lows, according to Investing.com.  The European Union’s fiscal stimulus deal and market expectations of an additional U.S. coronavirus stimulus package are pushing stocks higher.  Bitcoin has recently developed a stronger positive correlation with the equity markets.  It's worth noting that escalating China-U.S. tensions pose a risk to the equity market rally and possibly bitcoin prices.

The Alibaba-affiliate company made the claim in a release Thursday that announced Ant Blockchain was rebranding to AntChain.  An Ant spokesperson later told CoinDesk these were including transaction records, as well as copyright and property ownership certificates.  A spokesperson said they were unable to provide historic operational data for the “quiet period” in the run-up to its initial public offering (IPO).  Chinese shipping giant Cosco said it was trialing Ant Blockchain earlier this month to distribute tamper-free documentation, such as container records and import licenses.  The company now claims to be the largest operating blockchain in China.  AntChain will combine blockchain with Ant's other emerging tech offerings, including artificial intelligence and the internet of things.  The company also launched AntChain Station: a tool enabling enterprise clients to deploy on AntChain in under an hour – down from ten hours previously.  The spokesperson refused to be drawn on how many new clients they expected to onboard with AntChain Station, citing a quiet period.  Ant Group said this week it was planning an initial public offering on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges at a rumored $200 billion valuation.

While the amendments are pending approval by the U.S. Senate and President Donald Trump, they highlight the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) for defense-related activities ahead of the 2021 fiscal year.  The bipartisan provisions were introduced by Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL 9th District) and passed Tuesday.  The NDAA, a major defense act, was first passed in 1961 and contains a series of U.S. federal laws that oversee the annual budget and expenditures of the U.S. Department of Defense.  The first amendment to the NDAA builds off an incomplete briefing from the Fiscal Year 2020 NDAA conference report on the potential use of DLT for defense purposes by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, adding a reporting requirement.  The purpose of the resulting report will be to summarize the key findings of the briefing, assess research activities from ""adversarial"" countries, make recommendations for additional research of DLT and consider consolidating that research within a single hub.  The second amendment to the defense bill adds DLT to the definition of emerging technologies so it can be included in assessments for maintaining the U.S.' ""technological edge"" and will be overseen by the Steering Committee on Emerging Technology and Security Needs.  The NDAA also saw amendments for fiscal year 2021 that include the removal of Confederate names from military bases, a push for greater diversity and a plan to improve responses to pandemics like the coronavirus.  The amendments come after a report released in May by Amazon Web Services, IBM, Deloitte and others that suggested the U.S. was falling behind to rivals China and Russia on blockchain use in the military.

42384156,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA127N,1595491212,How One Firm Is Addressing the Interoperability Problem Posed by FATF's 'Travel Rule',"Crypto companies enthusiastically building solutions to bring the industry in line with anti-money laundering (AML) benchmarks may be creating their own interoperability problem.      There are a number of promising and popular solutions coming to the fore, but If a virtual asset service provider (VASP) using one solution is unable to talk to a counterparty using another, the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) requirement to leave an identifiable trail when transferring funds becomes pointless.      To remedy this “travel rule” conundrum, Netki is adding a system of “translators” to its TransactID protocol that the company says creates “an interoperability bridge” between VASPs, having discussed the proposal with the majority of other industry players.      “There is an interoperability problem because companies using different solutions are speaking different languages,” said Justin Newton, CEO of Netki. “We are building translators to all the other protocols. We've already started discussions and engagement with probably all the publicly known protocols, and with some of them there's already been tech engagement work going on.”      Read more: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      Meeting the FATF’s AML strictures, including the so-called travel rule, where personal identity data must be transferred with transactions over $1,000, has become a priority for crypto exchanges and custodians since last year when the requirement became mandatory.      Since then, there have been a plethora of proposed solutions with some firms clustering around their particular favorite, and networks of VASPs opting in another direction based on their jurisdiction, and so on.      While there appears to be agreement on a common data standard for how to read and write the message payload, the industry is aware there’s a looming interoperability issue regarding the underlying technology, with large players like BitGo and Coinbase expecting to pull smaller VASPs towards their preferred solutions.      Read more: BitGo Looks to Rally Exchange Clients Around FATF Travel Rule Product      Newton said many players in the travel rule solutions space are now talking about interoperability – but it’s just talking for the most part.      “Some other folks have been conceptually behind the idea of building it out, but no one's actually taking the next step of doing the building,” he said. “But we’ve actually started building interoperability at a technical as well as a relationship level.”      Netki is something of a veteran when it comes to crypto’s ID challenges. It issued a security standard back in 2016 based around Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 75. The peer-to-peer protocol, based on open standards, was available for anyone to use and sought compatibility between custodial and non-custodial wallets.      Unlike previous iterations, the new interoperability translator will be offered as a service to firms, as opposed to being purely open-source software.      “The interoperability bridge is proprietary, and there will be a charge for it,” said Newton. “At a high level, we are building boxes that can act as proxies or translators speaking one language on one side and speaking another language.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/23/how-one-firm-is-addressing-the-interoperability-problem-posed-by-fatfs-travel-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/152f6bd155f59d3e8ee9371f64c69697327a5ebe-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384149,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA122L,1595462400,Senate Hearing Sees Digital Dollar as a Tool for Economic Supremacy,"The idea of a U.S. digital dollar is no longer a fringe novelty. Now, it may be a means to an end.      The U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Policy conducted a hearing on “Winning the Economic Competition” between China and the U.S. on Wednesday. Once again, the idea of a Federal Reserve-administered central bank digital currency reared its head.      Much of the hearing was about America's economic relationship with China, and both nations’ economic relationships with the rest of the world. Four of the five speakers had no close ties to the crypto space and discussed issues like supply chain dependence and technologies like 5G.      Rather than focus a major part of the hearing on crypto, as two previous hearings did, crypto was brought up as one of many possible tools to maintain U.S. economic supremacy. This could be interpreted as crypto’s increasing acceptance as a mainstream idea.      Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Christopher Giancarlo, a longtime advocate for a digital dollar and one of Wednesday’s witnesses, once again called for the U.S. to begin conducting pilot programs to test out different facets of a tokenized dollar.      The idea is not just academic, said Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who chairs the subcommittee. During a previous hearing, Cotton also advocated for modernizing the dollar, saying it would need to be better than bitcoin.      Read more: In Wargaming Exercise, a Digital Yuan Neuters US Sanctions and North Korea Buys Nukes      “For us, maintaining the dollar’s supremacy is not only an economic matter, it is a critical strategic matter as well. It is what allows us to have such effective sanction regimes around the world as well as other benefits,” he said, before asking Giancarlo about the next steps in rolling out a digital dollar.      Giancarlo, as he has in the past, emphasized the issue of which nation’s values would define the global reserve currency. At the moment, the U.S. dollar fills that role, but he noted that China has been preparing to roll out a digital yuan, which could give the world’s most populous nation an edge.      Walter Russell Mead, the James Clarke Chace Professor of Foreign Affairs and Humanities at Bard College and a member of the Hudson Institute, agreed. A strong financial system “has been a foundation of prosperity and power for hundreds of years,” he said. He believes this is unlikely to change in the future, and agreed with Cotton that global dependence on the U.S. banking system is “one of our most effective tools of power.”      “We can’t just take an asset like that for granted,” he said. “We have to assume that as the nature of finance changes, the nature of currencies change, we have to stay at the leading edge of that ... innovation, so we do need to be thinking actively about how the dollar can be a fundamental building block for economic activity in this time of the information revolution.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/23/senate-hearing-sees-digital-dollar-as-a-tool-for-economic-supremacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c45f5666c7e7c0ba45750ff7e1999c04080c4a0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
