42378700,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZml,1464541713,Why ABN Amro Wants to Separate Bitcoin from the Blockchain,"For ABN Amro’s director of transaction banking, the company’s strategy on blockchain tech can be best described with a restaurant analogy.  If you were looking to enter the business, Karin Kersten argues, you might first invest in a restaurant. Next, you might try to get a feel for the workflow, washing dishes and observing existing staff. It's then, she said, that you might be ready to enter the kitchen.  It’s that final last stage that Kersten contends is most indicative of the activity at the Dutch bank, which boasts more than 22,000 employees across business lines including retail, private and corporate banking. A member of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project, and an investor in Digital Asset Holdings, ABN Amro has 30 employees actively working in the proverbial kitchen to investigate blockchain applications.  Kersten told CoinDesk:  ""We are doing experiments and seeing if they work. We are learning by doing, and working on different levels. There’s not just one team working on the blockchain.""  That’s not to say that ABN doesn’t have a more clear strategy for how it intends to move forward and which versions of the technology it deems more relevant for its business. As with many other major global banks, ABN is focused on distributed ledger aspects of the technology, and isn’t working with digital currencies such as bitcoin.  ""If you look at our view regarding the blockchain, we want to clearly separate bitcoin from the blockchain. There’s bitcoin as a method of payment, and blockchain as the technology behind it. The latter we find interesting to explore,"" she said.  Kersten indicated that ABN is investigating matters related to trade finance and transaction banking, and how blockchain smart contracts can be applied to problems in these areas.  In line with its focus on distributed ledgers, Kersten said that ABN is not as focused on payments applications of the tech, which she said the company views as being more problematic from a regulatory perspective today.  Letters of credit  That’s not to say that ABN Amro isn’t looking to better develop an understanding of how the tech could be applied broadly.  One area of study for the bank, Kersten said, is how the technology could play a role in the issuance of letters of credit, in which a bank guarantees that a buyer’s payment will be received according to an agreed set of conditions.  However, to start, Kersten explained how the ABN team approached this challenge by first talking with clients to understand the issues with current versions of this product. In the end, Kersten said this method found the bank deviating from its standard strategy, in which IT requirements dictate what is built.  ""Here the experiment is completely different. We had a hypothesis and tested it, then pivoted,"" she said.  Kersten said that ABN is now entering the second phase on this prototype and that it could advance this concept to the minimum viable product (MVP) stage, but that this process is taking time, a willingness to iterate and patience.  ""We want to learn about the content of the blockchain and see if there are interesting MVPs for clients. In the end, we want to add value,"" she continued.  The proof-of-concept is currently being built on the Ethereum blockchain.  Product over tech  While Kersten said that ABN Amro is working with the technology, along with IT vendors such as IBM and Tata Consultancy Services, she said that the company wants to focus less on lower-level parts of the stack, such as blockchain consensus methods.  Rather, she would like to see ABN Amro work on other components of its tests, namely, the top- and mid-level applications that facilitate communication between an application and a blockchain.  ""You have to make a basis choice per application if you want open-source or closed-source technology, but we want to make valuable applications which are relevant for our customer base,"" she said.  Still, Kersten acknowledged that ABN will likely need to deepen its understanding of parts of this process, such as when to select a public or private blockchain platform, and which design will best allow the necessary parties to access the ledger system.  But, Kersten said that projects like this don’t necessarily lead her to conclude that the technology will be ready for consumers soon.  Kersten told CoinDesk:  ""When will it be on the market? When will it have scale? We don’t know. What we know is that it’s a promising technology.""

42378709,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZzL,1464537419,London Workshop Explores Blockchain Identity in Finance,"The Identity & KYC conference in London hosted a workshop on using blockchain technology to improve know-your-customer processes earlier this week.  Led by blockchain compliance consultant Siân Jones, the workshop was attended by a group drawn from banks, financial institutions, startups and regulators.  The group discussed several challenges faced by banks and financial institutions when it comes to identity, and whether or not the blockchain can help solve these problems. The overwhelming consensus was that even though the blockchain is very promising, it has many real-world limitations around identity.  The discussion was exploratory in nature, focusing on the needs of current financial industry participants and exploring the use of potential blockchain technologies.  KYC moving beyond simple identity  The group discussed the impact on the financial industry of the trend of moving away from simply looking at government-issued identity cards, like passports and driver's licenses. Attendees looked at exploring more holistic datasets around individual identity that involve everything from purchase history to utilities connections to assess an individual’s identity.  These third-party data points already provide an important source of identification information beyond simple identification systems and are becoming increasingly popular in the financial industry and elsewhere to supplement government-provided identification data. They are also more nebulous in nature, giving a 'probability score' for how strongly the algorithm believes the individual is who she says she is.  The trend is expected to accelerate in the future, with simple identification mechanisms becoming less important for financial institutions.  In such a world, an identity on the blockchain, like a tokenized version of a driver’s license, may not be sufficient for most businesses and financial institutions. Any blockchain solution will therefore need to gather information on the individual available via third-parties, a considerably harder problem for blockchains to solve.  Where blockchains fall short  There are many challenges faced by the financial industry involving identity, and some of the key issues are hard problems to solve. The initial on-boarding process, when the issuing of identity is first conducted by a government or financial body after verifying information about the individual, still remains a challenge.  This is especially true on a global level, where a significant portion of the developing world is without any form of government-issued identification.  The reliability of any identity, whether on the blockchain or outside, is only as good as the authority issuing that identity. An identity verified and issued by the UK government, for example, would likely be considered more reliable than one issued by a bank in Somalia.  Advantages of blockchain-based identity  There are several advantages of using blockchain-based identity, especially around the quick dissemination of information about an individual in a global context.  This is true when identity needs to be revoked and reissued, especially in the event that someone's identity is stolen. For example, if a passport gets stolen, the issuing country might replace it, but it takes much longer for a financial institution in another country to know about the status of this identity revocation. Blockchain allows this process to be quick and efficient.  In addition, blockchain-based identity systems have the possibility of selectively revealing information about an individual’s identity. This could help prevent identity theft and enhance end-user privacy.  There could also be efficiency gains by larger institutions around issuing blockchain identities, especially because a lot of verification processes today are repetitive.  Although not a current concern to the nascent Internet of Things industry, several institutions are looking into how digital identity will play out when identity is not restricted to individuals and legally defined entities but also includes physical things.  A blockchain seems like an efficient solution to handle such large-scale identities that need to be shared among multiple stakeholders.  Starting point  Although many financial institutions are exploring blockchain technology for identity solutions, most of the rules and regulations around KYC and identity for regulated financial companies revolve around government-issued identity as the preliminary requirement. Therefore, the use of blockchain for identity will need to start with a government body deciding that it would issue some form of identity on the blockchain.  There are many unsolved problems around this, from privacy to access. For example, even though an identity document like a passport is issued to the individual, it isn’t owned by the individual in a legal sense.  It is unclear how the identity data on a blockchain will be owned — whether the individual or the identity issuing body will ultimately own the identity and data around it.  As Jones put it:  ""The fundamental challenge in identity is the intents of various participants are not aligned. Governments, businesses and individuals have conflicting interests.""

42378711,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7la0b,1464521938,Bitcoin Prices Break $500 Barrier to Hit 20-Month High,"Bitcoin prices broke through $500 on 28th May, building on the previous day’s momentum to reach a level not seen since August of 2014.  The sharp increase notably helped extend the digital currency’s recent rally, which has provided a stark contrast to the relative stability bitcoin experienced in the last several weeks and for much of the first half of 2016.  Overall, Saturday's move represented a 5.8% increase from its opening value of $473.47, a sharp rise that added to a 4.3% gain that took place on 27th May.  The digital currency first broke through the $500 level between 06:00 and 06:14 UTC on the 28th, eventually reaching a high of $531.70 for the day. At press time, the price had sagged somewhat, though prices remain $50 higher than just two days before.  During the run, prices hit their highest level since 21st August of 2014, when the price of bitcoin reached a high of $532.99 on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index.  Robust Optimism  Aside from the price increases, however, there was no clear verdict on whether the run would continue.  Data provided by bitcoin trading network Whaleclub suggests long-short ratios reached record levels of 15:1 over the last few days, a figure that shows that sentiment is currently best described as bullish, at least for now.  ""No clear fundamentals or catalysts are powering this rise in price,"" Petar Zivkovski, director of operations at Whaleclub, told CoinDesk.  He said:  ""Emotions have taken over: Traders have taken their rational lenses off and are buying with the expectation of selling higher in a short period of time. Inevitably, low-entry buyers will rush to take profit and price dumps will ensue.""  On the other side of the spectrum, market observers speculated that the effect of an upcoming decline in the amount of bitcoin paid to miners who process transactions on the network could fuel continued demand.  Such a sentiment was cited by OKCoin chief strategy officer Jack Liu who said that ""deflationary pressures"" could convince more buyers of bitcoin's value long term.  Charles L.
