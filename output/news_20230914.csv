The company's vertically integrated model and cheap energy costs position it as an outperformer in the BTC mining industry. TeraWulf's high SG&A and potential dilution are risks to be aware of, but the company has stated it will only dilute if it is accretive. When I last covered TeraWulf ( WULF ) for Seeking Alpha in late-June, the stock was trading at $1.73 per share. In the time since, WULF shareholders have taken the full round trip from $1.73 up to $4.04 and back to down to $1.70. Data by YCharts It's been an absolutely wild ride to say the least and at times this summer WULF was the best performing miner in the public markets. With another quarter of performance to assess and a fast approaching halving event coming in early 2024, I think it's a good time to check in on the fundamental setup for WULF to close out the year. Q2 Earnings In the three months ended June 2023, TeraWulf reported 35% sequential increase in revenue from $11.5 million in Q1 to $15.5 million in Q2. The company accomplished this with just a small $100k increase in cost of revenue and improved gross profit margin from 57% in Q1 to 67% in Q2. Data by YCharts From an opex standpoint, there was a small 3% increase in total operating expenses and the company decreased its operating loss for the second consecutive quarter: Data by YCharts Looking at the balance sheet, cash levels were noticeably lower from $17.0 million at the end of Q1 to just $8.2 million at the end of Q2. Total current liabilities actually increased from $56.1 million to $81.7 million sequentially: Data by YCharts However, total liabilities did decline from $170.5 million to $165 million quarter over quarter as the company continues to work toward paying down its debt. Data by YCharts Since the company is now running at 5.5 EH/s with plans to scale to 7.9 EH/s by the end of the year, TeraWulf is strongly positioned among the second tier miners by total capacity. Profitability in Sight? When combining the company's cost of revenue with the total opex, we can get a feel for how quickly the company could become profitable given its low energy pricing and flee efficiency: Q3-22 Q4-22 Q1-23 Q2-23 TTM Cost of Revenues $5,200,000 $5,300,000 $5,000,000 $5,100,000 $20,600,000 Total Opex $12,100,000 $17,700,000 $15,800,000 $16,200,000 $61,800,000 BTC Mined 117 387 533 909 1,946 Breakeven Price $147,863 $59,432 $39,024 $23,432 $42,343 Source: TeraWulf Filings In the table above, the company's breakeven price sans interest is roughly $23.5k - which is among the lowest prices that can be observed in the public mining space. Importantly, the breakeven figure has decline each of the last three quarters. Of course, this calculation doesn't include the company's debt payment obligations. I attempted to estimate that in my last TeraWulf article. In the company's latest investor deck, TeraWulf provided an internal calculation that shows $97.8 million in annualized EBITDA at a $30k BTC price: TeraWulf These calculations assume both 7.9 EH/s active capacity and a network hash rate of 400 which is right around where global hash rate has been for the last 5 months: Data by YCharts Interestingly, TeraWulf estimates a 10% increase in global hash rate post-halving and still projects the company's marginal cost to be under $24k per coin following the block reward halving: TeraWulf WULF is theoretically set up far better than many of the company's higher cost peers in the public equity market. Particularly the ones with asset light models. But something else that I think might be worth considering is the possibility that global hash rate doesn't actually go up much further following the halving. At current BTC prices, many of these companies aren't going to come close to breakeven following the halving and we could ultimately see machines from weaker miners turned off entirely if the BTC price doesn't re-rate higher. In that event, it's possible TeraWulf's share of the block reward could actually increase given the company's unit economics. While that's purely speculative on my part, I don't think it can be entirely ruled out if BTC's price remains where it is. Of course, if BTC's price does increase following the halving as it has historically, the unit economics of TeraWulf's operation could improve even with the smaller block reward. Risks In my last WULF article, I noted TeraWulf's high SG&A as a percentage of revenue compared to peers. While still somewhat high at 67% in Q2 compared to a few of the company's peers, TeraWulf was able to bring that expense down sequentially to $9.7 million in Q2. TeraWulf's reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenue was more attributable to the increase in revenue than the reduction in SG&A expense itself. Data by YCharts Like seemingly every public Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner, dilution is a risk for TeraWulf and that risk might be more significant if TeraWulf's debt and past actions are any indication. Of the mining equities sampled above, only CleanSpark ( CLSK ) has diluted shareholders to a larger degree purely from a shares outstanding perspective. However, on the last quarterly call, TeraWulf leadership was adamant that the company will not be diluting unless it is accretive. CFO Patrick Fleury said this near the end of the Q&A session: you will never, ever, ever see us issue, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars on the ATM in a quarter. The company's CEO Paul Prager mentioned numerous times that insiders hold a substantial portion of WULF shares and he purchased an additional 50,000 at $1.90 in mid-August. Data by YCharts One final risk to potentially consider is the growing short position in WULF shares. While still well below what would likely be viewed as the tier 1 public miners, TeraWulf's short percentage of shares outstanding has been edging higher than tier 2 peers in recent weeks and months. Investor Takeaways In the public Bitcoin mining space, there are roughly 2 dozen companies to choose from. Each of these entities is facing a significant macro headwind next year as the April block reward halving will virtually cut miner revenue in half overnight if the price of BTC and global hash rate both stay constant. In my view, and I think this view is shared broadly throughout the industry, the halving is likely going to put the weak dogs out of their misery. Given what I view as strong execution of a corporate strategy and a focus on mining efficiency, I believe TeraWulf is positioned well to be one of the survivors post-halving. I've taken a small introductory position in WULF shares at an average share price of $1.72. WULF is now one of five public miner equities that I'm exposed to and I anticipate holding WULF through the halving. I'll reiterate what I've said in countless SA articles; the safest way to benefit from an increase in the price of Bitcoin is to just hold BTC directly. However, for those with a high risk tolerance who want additional upside to gains in BTC pricing, miners like TeraWulf in an brokerage account may offer that upside.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4635307-terawulf-time-to-join-the-wulf-pack?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17652324.jpeg

17651232,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551286,1694732423,"Litecoin Eliminates Pre-Halving Gains As Volume Drops, Is A Fall To $50 Coming?","In the months leading up to the Litecoin halving in August, the price of the blockchain’s native LTC token was continuously on the rise. This renewed interest in investors who rushed back into the token and eventually pushed its price above $100. That is until the actual halving event rolled around, turning it into a “buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario. Since then, it has been a downward spiral for the token and the pain may not be over. Litecoin Volume Slumps Post-Halving Litecoin volume since the halving was completed has been less than expected. While investors expected rising demand for the LTC token with the diminished supply rate, the opposite has been the case. Instead, the daily trading volume of the cryptocurrency continued to slump. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wallet Activity Touches 5-Month High, Will BTC Price Follow? In the last day, the Litceoin daily trading volume fell another 23%. This brought its daily volume to $255 million, a significantly low figure compared to the $500 million daily volumes that the cryptocurrency was recording leading up to the halving. LTC daily volumes drops 23% | Source: CoinMarketCap Just like the trading volume, the price of LTC has also plunged significantly. From its pre-halving peak of $112, the altcoin has fallen over 50% to its current level just above $60. This means that the asset has lost all of its gains accumulated between June and July 2023, just one month after the halving was completed. So rather than being a bullish event as initially expected, the halving has proven to be more bearish than most. It also did not help that it took place during the bear market and LTC has fallen rapidly alongside larger assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. LTC price returns to pre-halving levels | Source: LTCUSD on Tradingview.com Will LTC Fall Continue To $50? At the current rate, the forecast does not look too good for the LTC price. Litecoin has understandably seen a 3% increase in the past day as Bitcoin recovered above $26,000. But this does not look sustainable by its current metric. The first indicator of this is that falling daily trading volume means that interest in the asset is waning. As investors move to other assets they believe provide better prospects, this will affect the LTC price and could trigger further downside from here. Add to this that the coin’s price is below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages and it spells a recipe for disaster. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Flee Ethereum Amid Plunge Toward $1,500 If LTC bulls are unable to hold support above $60 and it falls once again as it did on September 11, then $50 becomes a very possible landing point. Such a decline would put it back at November 2022 levels and signal a prolonged bear trend for the digital asset. At the time of writing, LTC price is still sitting above $62 but the tug-of-war for control between bulls and bears continues to rage on.

The platform is enjoying renewed user interest, with its total value locked (TVL) surpassing $20 million a few days ago. Thanks to this growing momentum, Friend.tech has seen its trading volume and platform fees rise to new peaks. Friend.tech Continues Resurgence With New Trading Volume Peak Decentralized application (dApp) Friend.tech has witnessed significant activity in the past few days. This has been reflected in the social media platform’s daily active users, which grew to nearly 16,000 on Wednesday, September 13. As a result of this upward trend, Friend.tech also reached its highest trading volume of $18.51 million on Wednesday, according to Dune Analytics data. The platform recorded $1.9 million in capture fees, representing another all-time high on the same day. Related Reading: Ethereum Leverage Ratio Is Rising, What Does It Mean? Dune data dashboard revealed that fees on Friend.tech accounted for more than 35% of the gas cost on the Base blockchain on September 13. Moreover, the population of traders on the decentralized application experienced a significant increase, with unique buyers surpassing 155,000. Meanwhile, the number of unique sellers climbed above 75,000 on Wednesday. As of this writing, Friend.tech has a total value locked of nearly $34 million, according to DefiLlama. This figure represents an almost 30% rise in the past 24 hours. Here Are Possible Reasons For Friend.tech’s Recovery Friend.tech went live on Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 network, Base, in August. The decentralized application allows users to trade “keys” of X (formerly Twitter) accounts and interact with social media personalities in a closed, group chat format. Following its launch, Friend.tech gained prominence within a short span. However, activity on the platform slumped abruptly before the end of August, with its trading volume nosediving by 94% at some point. Fortunately, Friend.tech appears to have recovered from the decline. Although there is no evident catalyst for the platform’s latest activity surge, various theories have emerged from different angles of the crypto community. Related Reading: Base TVL Surges 900% In 2 Weeks, What’s Driving The Growth? Notably, a recent TokenTerminal report proposed that several factors may be responsible for Friend.tech’s growth. Specifically, the blockchain analytics site highlighted that Friend.tech has no direct competitor, with X (a Web2 application) being its closest rival. Additionally, the report pointed to the social media platform’s strategic takeoff, which coincided with the public mainnet launch of Base. TokenTerminal suggested that the timing of Friend.tech’s launch was to maximize activity on both the dApp and blockchain. Another possible reason for the latest resurgence was explained by popular crypto trader Hsaka. According to the trader’s post on X, the platform’s total value locked soared since users discovered they could receive rewards for depositing crypto assets.

17647881,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551429,1694725228,Binance.US Plagued By Staff Exodus: Legal And Risk Executives Abandon Ship,"In recent developments, Binance.US, the American affiliate of cryptocurrency giant Binance, is engulfed in a storm of legal challenges and a wave of executive departures. Related Reading: Ethereum Leverage Ratio Is Rising, What Does It Mean? Binance.US Rocked By Legal Woes And Executive Exodus As regulatory scrutiny intensifies, key risk and legal executives have chosen to part ways with the company, adding to the growing list of personnel changes within its ranks. Following this trend, according to a Wall Street Journal report, Krishna Juvvadi, the head of legal, and Sidney Majalya, the chief risk officer, have also decided to leave Binance.US. These departures come in the wake of CEO Brian Shroder’s recent exit, further exacerbating the leadership vacuum at the company. Earlier this week, Binance.US announced the departure of CEO Brian Shroder and disclosed plans to reduce its workforce by approximately one-third, amounting to over 100 job cuts. These moves underscore the operational challenges faced by the company following legal action taken against it by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Norman Reed, the general counsel who joined Binance.US in December 2021, will serve as the interim CEO, taking over from Shroder. However, Binance.US has not provided any specific reasons for Shroder’s departure. The legal troubles for Binance and its subsidiaries intensified when the US SEC filed a civil complaint in June. The complaint accuses Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, of creating Binance.US as part of a deceptive scheme to evade US securities laws designed to protect American investors. While Binance and Binance.US maintain that they operate separately, the legal challenges faced by the global exchange have had a ripple effect across its affiliated entities. The departure of key executives, including Mayur Kamat, the global head of product, and Patrick Hillmann, the chief strategy officer, further underscores the turbulent environment within the company. As the departures of high-ranking executives continue to disrupt Binance.US, the firm’s spokesperson has emphasized the need to ensure uninterrupted customer service while operating as a crypto-only exchange. Nevertheless, the ongoing legal battles and the departure of experienced leaders present significant challenges for Binance.US as it seeks to navigate the complex regulatory landscape and regain stability. Related Reading: FTX’s Billion-Dollar Solana Liquidation: Market Crash Or Just Hype? Binance.US will have to address the legal allegations against it and make strategic decisions to rebuild its leadership team, strengthen compliance measures, and restore trust among regulators, investors, and users. The outcome of these efforts will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of the exchange and its ability to operate within the highly regulated US crypto market. Despite the recent news, Binance Coin (BNB) has remained relatively unaffected and has experienced minimal impact on its price.

42409682,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcNPFn,1694722229,The Inanity of the SEC 'Stoner Cat' Action,"On Wednesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) told the creators of the NFT-powered, animated web series “Stoner Cats” it’s going to have to cough up a $1 million fine, and kill the cartoon kitties left in its possession. And today, Stoner Cat NFTs are worth 250% more than yesterday with trading volume spiking 7,256%.  Huh? Wha? Why?  What’s the matter, cat got your tongue?  No. Hairball.  It seems that, in its complaint, the SEC may have left open a few questions regarding these cartoon cats, including several about the NFTs trading on the secondary market.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Stoner Cats 2, LLC, the organization that created the NFTs and is responsible for paying the SEC fine, will also have to help set up a reimbursement fund to pay back injured investors. This “Fair Fund,” a type of account established under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as a way to return profits from defrauded investors, will technically be operated by the SEC. (It’s important to note Stoner Cats 2, LLC, did not admit fault by settling.)  But it’s as yet unclear exactly how much will have to be put aside for the fund, or how the disgorged money will be distributed. Will people get back ETH or U.S. dollars? Will it be equivalent to the $800 NFT mint price or at current market prices? Will injured victims also be forced to liquidate their Cats or get to keep them as a souvenir?  Considering that Stoner Cats were changing hands at a floor price of just 0.019 ETH for months and months and months, it seems like some people see the SEC action as a way to earn a profit. And they might, now that the gods of volatility have at least temporarily blessed this illiquid market.  But does anyone expect to get back the full 0.35 ETH paid apiece on minting day?  By way of comparison, when Poloniex set up its Fair Fund as part of a settlement over failing to register as a national securities dealer, it seems to have been topped off with the $8,484,313.99 in disgorgement, $403,995.12 in prejudgment interest and $1,500,000 civil money penalty the Justin Sun-connected crypto exchange paid.  If the Stoner Cats Fair Fund is similarly structured that might mean there will only be $1 million set aside for reimbursements, given that there only seems to be a $1 million civil penalty attached to the settlement. That’s only a fraction of the 3,650 ETH – worth $8.2 million at the time, and a little above $5 million today – raised in the token sale, let alone the 344 ETH (~$787K at the time) wasted in gas fees on failed transactions during the botched launch.  Then again, as the SEC also noted most minters ended up selling their tokens on the open market rather than holding the tokens as collectibles. In fact, that was essentially the SEC’s whole argument for going after Stoner Cats 2, LLC, which was able to gin up attention for the project by talking about the Hollywood talent attached — all but saying how could something Ashton Kutcher is involved in go wrong?  But if minters made a profit selling their tokens on the secondary market – which the SEC said happened at least 10,000 times, earning Stoner Cats 2, LLC, $20 million in “royalties” – could they really be called “injured investors?” Worse, I don’t think the Fair Fund is open to token holders who bought on the open market and got stuck holding the bag, who had to watch the value of Stoner Cats erode during the bear market along with every other “profile pic” NFT.  See also: Cats Clog Ethereum, the Sequel | Opinion  It’s possible that Stoner Cats spiked not because of anything rational, but simply because the SEC happened to shine a floodlight on a project that the world otherwise has forgotten about. And boy to do those floodlights feel warm in the crypto winter. Crypto trading has always been about “crowd psychology,” with the most important element just getting attention. (This also explains the mechanics behind Stoner Cats, which somehow got people to pay $800 for an NFT token that unlocks six episodes of a Seth McFarlane web series.)  Stoner Cats was one of the few NFT projects to actually deliver on the promises made during the token raise, or in other words it delivered on its idea of ""utility."" I don't exactly know if that makes the NFTs worth ""collecting,"" as some have been saying, but the whole idea was to pay to crowdfund a show and to receive a token as a keepsake – the fact that NFTs are transferable doesn't mean they were ""investment contracts.""  This is the exact point made by SEC Commissioners Mark T. Uyeda and Hester M. Peirce in their recently published dissent, where they said if what Stoner Cats 2, LLC, did was illegal then so was selling “Star Wars collectibles...in the 1970s” as well as a whole range of activities literally currently sustaining ""artists, creators and entertainers"" today.  All of which only makes the SEC action all the more absurd than it sounds. Here is a project that did what it set out to do, where it's not been proved that original investors have been harmed and where the solution being set up doesn't seem to help anyone.  And the world would have happily forgotten about it, but because there are celebrities attached to this particular project the SEC has decided to make an example out of them.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/14/the-inanity-of-the-sec-stoner-cat-action,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0788634122ce7e11c9f0f258474265ab09d58cf-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

First, here are how the support and resistance levels look like from an on-chain perspective, according to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock: The concentration of holders at the different price levels | Source: IntoTheBlock Generally, investors tend to buy more at their cost basis (the price at which they bought their coins) whenever the price dips back to their cost basis from above. As they had been in profits before this dip, they may believe that the price would rise shortly and that their cost basis could be a profitable entry point for further accumulation. On the other hand, investors in loss might look forward to the price reaching their cost basis to sell and exit. This can provide resistance to the asset if many investors have the same cost basis as the price it’s trying to test from below. In the above infographic, the various price levels and the investor concentrations at them are displayed. When IntoTheBlock posted it, the price had been trading at $26,100. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wallet Activity Touches 5-Month High, Will BTC Price Follow? The cryptocurrency is currently mowing through the $26,100 to $26,900 range, which holds the cost basis of a decent amount of investors. Should the asset’s attempts fail, though, the $25,300 to $26,100 range should provide plenty of support, as it currently has a thick concentration of holders. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Have Occurred Throughout The Last Month However, one sign that may be concerning for the asset is that the whales have been making significant deposits to exchanges during the past month, as analyst James V. Straten has pointed out. The value of the metric seems to have been above zero for most of this period | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X The above chart shows the data for the Bitcoin exchange netflows only for transfers worth at least $10 million. This graph shows that the metric has mostly had a positive value throughout the past month, meaning that large entities like the whales have been constantly moving coins into these platforms. As one of the main reasons these investors may transfer to exchanges is for selling purposes, this could indicate that these holders have been preparing for a selloff. It remains to be seen whether these Bitcoin whale exchange inflows would lead to this short-lived rise or if the market would bash through the selling pressure.

Even in light of big catalysts, volumes are stagnating, IV is trending lower, and the price isn't moving much. The fundamental picture is strong, but it only makes sense if you know where to look. On-chain activity does not at all tell the whole story, and I explain why. Bitcoin's utility and development of practical use cases all make it an attractive investment opportunity. Together with Bitcoin's upcoming catalysts, such as the halving in 2024 and the potential launch of a Spot ETF, this makes right now a good time to accumulate BTC. The biggest risk for Bitcoin is really PR at this point. The Bitcoin community must educate more people. That is the only way to adoption. Now is a great time to accumulate Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). There are many upcoming catalysts for BTC to reward investors over the next year. This article will not go into those much-repeated points. If interested, research the items in this non-exhaustive list of near-term catalysts: - Bitcoin’s Halving in 2024 – Halvings have historically been followed by a price surge. - BTC Spot ETF – Bullish because it creates more liquidity and demand - Institutional Adoption – Institutional adoption means more liquidity and demand as well. It also means more money used to fund the development of financial infrastructure for Bitcoin. - Regulatory Clarity in Crypto – Reduces the barriers due to regulatory uncertainty. Also increases the pace of innovation in crypto. - Mining to Subsidize Green Energy Solutions – This allows BTC to be recognized as an ESG-friendly asset. (Bitcoin always was ESG friendly, hence “to be recognized as” instead of “to become”). This article will talk about the utility that Bitcoin development has been unlocking, and hence economic value rather than price action from supply and demand. Think of this as the fundamentals. Bitcoin’s strong fundamentals should also be overlaid with a sentiment analysis, which will be covered first. As stated, the main takeaway is that right now is probably a great time to accumulate BTC. Tulips Preface Critics accuse BTC of being a bubble, comparing it to the dot-com bubble or to tulips. Tulips/bubble assets don’t last for 14 years, nor do they keep exceeding their previously established all-time high, nor are they assets with clear use cases. In The Bitcoin Thesis That No One Is Talking About, I go deep into an undeniable use case of Bitcoin that is little mentioned. If you keep calling this a bubble or keep claiming “this is beginning of the end of Bitcoin,” your actual conclusion is that the market has been wrong for 14 straight years. “Markets are never wrong – opinions often are.” – Jesse Livermore Of course, there are times when the market-wide time preference shortens. Morgan Housel’s The Psychology of Money explores the rationality (not irrationality) behind bubbles. The simple answer is that investors’ time preference shortens. During bubbles, the next day or week is nearly guaranteed to see a higher price. The time preference of investors collapses from a “normal” focus on a longer term to an abnormal focus on this immediate short term. Abnormal and normal are not denotations of rationality, they are simply a statement that most of the time (normally) time preference is not as short as “until tomorrow.” This is FOMO in its distilled and wholly rational form. Bursting bubbles is the opposite: as time preference lengthens, discounted cash flows become the dominant force of consideration and valuations come back down. “Sentiment shifts” is another name for describing the phenomenon of changing time preference. This understanding is also why I have chosen to subdivide my analysis by time preference, because within these fluctuations are many opportunities. And without at least acknowledging time preference, one’s investment thesis is hopelessly incomplete. When we look at Bitcoin in its entire 14-year history, there are moments of collapsing time preference. But 14 years is long for a persistent short-term time preference while also supporting an asset that is still outperforming nearly everything else over the same time. If these magic internet coins are tulips, then by their age alone they are very special tulips indeed. Sentiment: Poor, Bearish, and Apathetic The crypto bear market has dragged on for nearly two years. BTC is still down 60% from its all-time high in November 2021. A lot of seemingly bullish news has been met with short-lived spikes followed by longs taking profits. BTC has had a tough time breaking through resistance at $30,000 over the last five months. Also, BTC’s trading volume is at five-year lows, signaling an apathetic market. The choppy price action of the last few months has been driven by record-low volumes. When volumes pick up again, the actual direction of the market should be clearer. Record Low Bitcoin Volumes (data.bitcoinity.org) Low volumes in crypto have been making headlines . Most crypto is speculation, so I interpret this as speculative interest slowing down for a big chunk of the industry. Comments in the linked article also suggested the same interpretation. However, it is key to separate the utility of speculation from the utility of Bitcoin. If you believe that Bitcoin has intrinsic utility, then this period of apathy in which the baby is seemingly being thrown out with the bathwater is a great time to accumulate. I am reminded of the bloodbath in REITs over this last year, when astute investors were able to scoop up good deals as the market relentlessly punished all REITs simply for being associated with commercial real estate. Likewise, BTC model free implied volatility (ie. a VIX calculation from option prices) is also at 4-year lows. It is likely at all-time lows, but the IV data on T3 Index does not go back far enough. For context, crypto prices generally rise with IV. This feature is different from equities. Such lows in both IV and trading volume should indicate that the crypto bear market is on the precipice of ending. Bitcoin Implied Volatility (T3 Index) Given historical trends, BTC is also at relative lows. Below are two charts that put BTC’s price on a log scale with various annotations. The rainbow chart is a bit like a dynamic RSI that shows oversold and overbought regions. It also annotates the halvings. Rainbow Chart (blockchaincenter.net) The 200 Week Moving Average Heatmap | LookIntoBitcoin with the 200 Week Moving Average shows that BTC rarely stays below its 200 Week Moving Average. The points when it is touching or below this moving average have been great accumulation zones. 200 Week Moving Average + Heatmap (lookintobitcoin.com) These charts all point towards a market that is exhausted and oversold. Though not fully capitulated (one might argue capitulation was last year when BTC bottomed at around $16,000), the sentiment has been negative and apathetic. Public attention this year has been drawn away from crypto and towards trends like AI. The investment landscape has been favoring big tech, semiconductors, and even more recently energy. Again, the logical consequence of this matches up with what we see in the charts: apathy towards BTC and crypto in general as an investment. This is why now is probably a great time to start a dollar cost average accumulation. The sentiment could continue to worsen for a while, but the backstop is the fundamental, intrinsic value of BTC. New use cases have continued to develop over the course of the BTC bear market. Fundamentals: Bitcoin Usage is Uniquely Elusive to the Casual Observer The “fundamentals” of something like BTC is the potential for usage and adoption. BTC aims to be money, and all money is backed by the economy which uses it (note that this is very different from saying the “country that uses it” because economies can easily be international). The reason the USD is the strongest currency is that the collective households and firms which use the USD constitute the largest economic bloc in the world. This is also why countries who try to steer their economies away from using the USD are seen as a threat to dollar hegemony. (Note that being seen as a threat is different from being an actual threat. The dollar hegemony is very strong for reasons deeply embedded in basic international economic principles. I cover those in greater detail here .) The more people using Bitcoin for payments, the stronger BTC’s fundamentals become. This same logic does not quite apply to other cryptocurrencies, especially because many have token models which make them resemble securities. In this case, greater use of the underlying blockchain network may lead to price appreciation in the short term as a function of speculation, but the price cannot be sustained by the cash flows generated in the long term. The problem with Bitcoin usage is that it’s not as clear-cut as amateur analysts think. Some think that because the blockchain is a transparent ledger, they can simply look on chain to see whether adoption is happening. This works for Ethereum, and it is arguably the only good way to objectively measure Ethereum adoption. But it doesn’t work for Bitcoin. Both Ethereum and Bitcoin have started to scale in layers , but they have taken completely different layer scaling approaches. To put it simply: Ethereum uses rollups, which are basically separate transparent blockchains with their own set of transactions and consensus. Thus, “on-chain” activity refers not just to the Ethereum base layer, but also to all the separate rollup blockchains linked to Ethereum. These are all transparent. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has used state channels– like the Lightning Network – as its L2 scaling solution. State channels are not separate blockchains, so they do not have the transparency that Ethereum rollups have. The basic concept of a state channel is that users can share a common on-chain state with each other and then sign updates to change this state. One example of an individual “state” would be how much BTC is owned by either person. At any point, the signed state updates (called “commitments”) can be published to the blockchain, and the corresponding state will be reflected in the main chain. This enables people to do an unlimited number of transactions off-chain, by exchanging commitments with their counterparts, with the option of publishing the results of these transactions on-chain at any time. Without going into details about the tradeoffs between a state channel and a rollup solution, we can clearly see that the state channel solution is much more elusive to the casual observer because it never appears on chain. In fact, after the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade in 2021, it is impossible to tell when a new state channel for the Lightning Network is being opened or closed. Before that, it was possible to tell based on on-chain information that two users were creating a multisignature address to potentially initiate a state channel. Thus, Bitcoin usage has reached a point where no one can truly know how big it has gotten. Where and How To Get an Idea There are a few places to look to get an idea. 1ML is a site that reports the number of channels and how much BTC is locked in these channels. Below is a screenshot of their main dashboard. For clarity, a “Node” helps connect multiple channels so that users who do not have direct channels with each other can still pay each other through a mutual connected user (in this case the Node). 1ML Dashboard (1ML) The important thing to remember is that Lightning dashboards like these can never provide the complete picture the way a complete picture can be provided for Ethereum and its rollups. First, these are only the known channels that the Lightning Nodes are aware of. The Lightning Nodes being surveyed are also only the nodes that this website is aware of. Because the code is open source, entire communities can set up their own Bitcoin payments system using Lightning infrastructure and never be known by sites like 1ML. Finally, while we can see how many channels there are, there is no way to tell how many transactions are going through those channels. Each transaction is a state update signed and kept by the users of the channel, so only the users themselves really know their own transaction volume. In contrast, the exact number of transactions, accounts, value, and even the time each event occurred is always known for the Ethereum ecosystem, because one can just add together everything across all the rollups. The Block depicts the number BTC locked into channels over time. Again, these numbers are only what is known. There is almost certainly a non-zero number of unknown channels with BTC that is not counted in this figure. Furthermore, since the Taproot upgrade in late 2021 and the popularization of Lightning over the last three years, the likelihood of more channels being unknown grows higher and higher. Lightning Network Total Known Capacity (The Block) Other Elusive Indications: Fedimint, Ark, ZeroSync Unlike Ethereum, which has largely focused on growing smart contract functionality for on-chain trading, Bitcoin development has largely focused on the more practical use cases for the average consumer, such as payments and personal banking, and nearly always focusing on BTC as the main token. In contrast, Ethereum projects tend to release their own tokens and focus on infrastructure which can be leveraged to shuffle around many different tokens (including and often especially the token the project created) for the purpose of earning yields and conducting highly leveraged trades. Thus, the flavor of innovation is yet another major difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Both ecosystems have innovation, but innovative energy is consumed to achieve different objectives. The Bitcoin ecosystem does not regard a high level of programmability as paramount. When I was first learning about crypto, this caused me so much confusion and misunderstanding towards Bitcoin. It seemed that Ethereum projects were very organized and standardized. Each reputable project had its own documentation, a list of smart contract addresses, a whitepaper of how its proposed features can be implemented on-chain, a section explaining the project’s token details, and so forth. Though many Ethereum projects did things very differently and in very creative ways, they all followed the same basic format of being able to somehow facilitate the exchange of tokens on-chain. Initially, I wrote this off as Bitcoin being the older ecosystem where nothing happened. But then the question of why Bitcoin never retreats from its number 1 spot on the crypto market cap ranking became more and pressing. You could say this was me reckoning why the market has been so wrong! I have now come to realize that Bitcoin’s innovations are happening constantly, but just not in a rigidly standardized manner because the simplicity of Bitcoin leaves so much room for different methods of innovation. One example of this is clearly the Lightning Network. Another is something like Rootstock , an EVM smart contract blockchain that is merge-mined with Bitcoin, launched back in 2018. Rootstock has over 50% of Bitcoin’s enormous hash rate securing it, making it the second most secure blockchain and the most secure smart contract blockchain in the world. Much more recent examples are Fedimint , Ark , and ZeroSync . Each one is a unique approach to Bitcoin scaling that is still in the testing phase. Each one is focused on expanding the use case of the BTC token only. To keep this short, I’ll only cover Fedimint, which I think is simple enough to describe both non-technically and concisely. The basic idea of Fedimint is that communities can create their own multisignature wallets and have trusted members of the community be the “guardians” who hold the keys of the BTC in the wallet. Then, the community can mint IOUs against the BTC in the wallet and use a centralized ledger to keep track of IOU transactions, while ensuring things like privacy and full reserve backing. Each community can adjust the parameters to suit their needs. Each instance of a community multisignature wallet with its own BTC IOUs is called an individual Fedimint. The Fedimint protocol is also compatible with the Lightning Network , so Fedimints can be set up to send BTC to other Fedimints via Lightning. It’s clear that Fedimint is another variation of a state channel scaling solution. Unlike Lightning, it uses a trust-based setup. This is okay because Fedimint is intentionally designed for communities – the guardians are members of the community who are known to others and whom others already trust with other things (random examples: babysitting, being a good neighbor, dog walking, etc). Any funny business will have steep social costs. This may not seem too useful in countries with strong rule of law. Also, many in the West feel no persistent need to trust the members in their community. But Fedimint is an absolute game changer for the unbanked of the world, and many of these are the exact people who must rely on their communities. Now apply this to what has already been said about Lightning. Fedimint’s transactions are all off-chain. With Taproot, we can’t even know if a new Fedimint is being started. Fedimints can send stuff to each other via Lightning, another off-chain solution. These kinds of technologies will grow Bitcoin adoption. And they are invisible to the casual observer, or the junior analyst looking for on-chain activity. When crypto news platforms are talking more about Ordinals NFTs, BRC-20 tokens, and the ETF than about the development of practical use cases, you can be sure that the masses are not aware of all that is happening. Bitcoin is a global settlement layer, and everything built over it helps increase Bitcoin’s use case and reach. The ecosystem holds the ultimate long-term view: slowly help people around the world gain financial autonomy, slowly let the free market do its job, slowly watch people innovate and take risks without avoidable financial insecurities, slowly have each newer generation understand these benefits, then slowly become the world’s de facto money. Risk The biggest uncertainty today is Bitcoin’s public relations. On the one hand, governments are incentivized to try to hold on to their monetary monopoly. But this is much harder if more people understand Bitcoin. If Bitcoin cannot attract enough public support, then governments may be able to establish some hold over it and reaffirm their monopoly over money. Thus, the risk increases with the number of autocratic regimes (governments who do not have to listen to their citizens) and increases with the number of people who cannot think critically. The former is a falling number, but the latter is a rising number. My suspicion is that as times get worse, mainly due to the state of today’s money, more people will begin to wake up and ask questions like: Why are my savings engineered to lose value ? Why is one entity allowed to print money for free to buy up everything? Why does everyone I know labor for something that costs nothing to create? Why do I have to keep taking financial risks just so I can keep my purchasing power? Why was I taught in school that rising prices are good when everyone I know prefers to have things get cheaper over time? Why do I get taxed and why do we spend so much on tax collection bureaucracies when the government can just print its own money? Why can’t I and my partner afford a house at age 32 when my grandpa had one at age 25 and he was the only income earner, and grandma was already pregnant with their second child (my uncle) at the same time? Oh, and some of these issues are due to bad life choices – not just the fact that the monetary base has expanded by 70x causing the dollar to lose 87% of its value since 1970 – so I’ll also include: Why did I choose to get a worthless degree with no career application? Why did I choose to buy so many expensive Starbucks lattes and gluten free avocado toast? Generally, these questions point one towards the Austrian School, sound money, and, inevitably, Bitcoin. They might also cause one to cut back on lattes (Starbucks (SBUX) might be a good short idea, I don’t know). Ultimately, it’s a big uncertainty how Bitcoin’s public perception will emerge after this time. The regulatory landscape, at least in the U.S., seems more and more crypto friendly, and this has been especially true for Bitcoin. Bitcoin was notably called out as the only crypto that was certainly not a security. Yet, many people still believe it is a ponzi scheme. Those who believe that governments will move to ban it without any regard for the preference of the people are implicitly denying the power of rule of law and constitutional freedoms. They also run the risk of denying the force of the free market, which is a very dangerous bet. The more useful question is whether people themselves will want money that cannot be debased. And this is of course a PR question. The prevailing PR campaign has been to encourage the acceptance of inflationary money and benevolent technocrats who dictate monetary policy from above, all using highly robust “ data dependent ” methodologies, no doubt. Will Bitcoin’s PR campaign – involving sound money , cheaper prices , less leverage, and personal wealth secured by the mere knowledge of 12 words – win any hearts and minds? Who knows. Conclusion There have never been tulips like Bitcoin. I am buying these tulips with both hands because I see the strong fundamentals beneath the surface. More importantly, most other people do not see these fundamentals yet. We can confirm this because many crypto commentators don’t even know where to look when it comes to evaluating Bitcoin’s progress. Even more importantly, the current sentiment is too negative and apathetic to ignore. My recommendation is not for you to take my word on these points, but for you to look and find the truth yourself. I reaffirm my buy rating and would upgrade to strong buy at $20,000. If it falls below that point, I will liquidate some stocks to buy more (unless stocks also happen to be down big). The next several months should be very interesting with all the catalysts listed at the beginning of this article. 2024 looks like a wonderful year for BTC.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4635271-bitcoin-why-im-buying-14-year-old-tulips-with-both-hands?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17646043.jpeg

17644496,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551319,1694718014,"Analyst’s Ultra Bullish Prediction Puts XRP Price At $10,000, But When?","Amid the bullish predictions that have popped up over the last few weeks for the XRP price, the most recent one stands out. The forecast which was presented by pseudonymous crypto analyst and XRP maxi known as Lord XRP, will put the altcoin on par with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum if it becomes a reality. Analyst Puts XRP Price At $10,000 In a post shared on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, the crypto analyst presents a situation that could see the XRP price rise as high as $10,000. The visual shared puts the XRP market cap in contrast to mainstream payment processing companies dominating the traditional finance sphere. Related Reading: Why This Crypto Exchange Founder Believes Bitcoin Can Still Rise 150% From Here Such comparisons are not new given that Ripple, the company behind the XRP token, is looking to disrupt the payments sector using blockchain technology. The company is expecting to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions, something that has been repeatedly presented as a bull case for the XRP price. $10’000 per #XRP is possible✅✅ pic.twitter.com/aJ8FxrHBIz — Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) September 10, 2023 The chart shows the all-time high market cap of XRP which was $30 billion in 2018 compared to the transactions carried out by payments giants such as Western Union ($80 billion) and SWIFT ($5 trillion). It also highlights the $577 billion in non-cash transactions carried out globally each year. If Ripple is able to capture a good chunk of this payments market share, then the analyst believes that it is possible for the XRP price to rise as high as $10,000 per token. Lord XRP is not the only one who has made ultra-bullish predictions for the altcoin, although it is certainly the highest by a mile. Wells Fargo Manager Shannon Thorp has also predicted that the XRP price could reach as high as $500 as Ripple begins to capture more market share in the cross-border payments space. From the 2023 New Value Report by #Ripple $250T is expected by 2027 just in cross-border payments! A $500 XRP price just doesn’t seem like enough to facilitate that amount. 😉 $xrp #xrpisnotasecurity pic.twitter.com/HvIIp0vIiD — Shannon Thorp (@thorpshannon87) September 11, 2023 Is Such A Price Point Possible? While investors could be giddy to see such price predictions, it does not make them feasible and the evidence lies in the supply of XRP. With a 100 billion total supply, a $10,000 price point would put the market cap of XRP at over $100 trillion, which is actually impossible given that the total crypto market cap is sitting at only $1 trillion. Related Reading: This Latest Move Suggests SEC Lawsuit Against Ripple Is Pushing The Crypto Firm Outside The US To put this in perspective, the gold market cap, which happens to be a rather unlimited resource, was only at a $12.7 trillion market cap at the end of 2021. Bitcoin which is the pioneer cryptocurrency, topped out at a $1.27 trillion market cap during the 2021 bull market. If there was a burn mechanism that drastically reduced the XRP supply over the next few years, then a $10,000 price point could be possible. However, with no burn mechanism and such a large supply still being available, a double-digit price point would be a call for celebration among the community.

42392599,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8XGz,1694715809,Most Important U.S. Senator for Crypto’s Future Tells Regulators to Use Existing Powers,"U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), whose chairmanship of the Senate Banking Committee gives him power over crypto’s congressional destiny, issued a call to arms to regulators on Thursday, demanding that they use whatever authority they currently have over digital assets to improve market transparency and protect the investors putting their money into the sector.  Brown sent a letter to the heads of the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), calling for them to address the dangers of the industry.  “I ask that your agencies assess their authorities and evaluate how we can build on our existing disclosure guardrails to effectively target the deficiencies we have observed in digital asset tokens and digital asset platforms,” Brown wrote in the letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, SEC Chair Gary Gensler and CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam.  He contended that the industry isn’t going to police itself.  “Ultimately, inadequate disclosures persist because opacity serves sponsors, executives, and other crypto industry insiders,” Brown argued. “It is far easier to profit when customers are left in the dark. That’s why the crypto companies resist real transparency and try to force Americans to accept the paltry, self-serving disclosures endemic to the industry.”  The senator had already praised the SEC’s enforcement crackdown on crypto in a Senate hearing earlier this week. This latest sentiment is inarguably harsh for the crypto sector from the lawmaker whose legislative intentions have been murky, at best. While the House of Representatives has cleared consequential crypto bills for floor votes, the Senate has accomplished little more than introducing and reintroducing legislation that still awaits committee action.  The crypto industry and regulators have strongly encouraged lawmakers to come up with rules tailored for its unique products and assets. Brown’s words would suggest a need for new rules, even if Congress hasn’t yet provided a roadmap to guide the agencies in writing them. With this note, Brown isn’t explicitly suggesting any legislation that he’s getting behind, just that “Congress can work to provide Americans with the information they need.”  Meanwhile, Gensler at the SEC has been executing his belief that existing securities laws govern crypto, leaving virtually every cryptocurrency business out of compliance and vulnerable to his agency’s enforcement team.

17642693,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551389,1694714419,FTX’s Billion-Dollar Solana Liquidation: Market Crash Or Just Hype?,"The potential Solana (SOL) liquidation from failed exchange FTX has become a focal point for traders and crypto investors. The speculation and accompanying FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) surrounding the potential sell-off have amplified market uncertainties. A recent court approval paved the way for the embattled exchange FTX to liquidate $3.4 billion in diverse digital assets. This move, announced by Judge John Dorsey, has set off a whirlwind of debates, especially regarding Solana, one of the assets in FTX’s portfolio. Related Reading: Solana Gains 5% Despite CPI Latest Data And FTX Liquidation Approval – Here Could Be Why Diving Deep: FTX’s Solana Holdings And Potential Impact Among FTX’s vast portfolio, a prominent $1.16 billion is in Solana (SOL). When pitted against FTX’s overall liquid cryptocurrency assets worth $3.4 billion, SOL forms a hefty chunk, over one-third. FTX’s potential dumping of SOL and its conceivable effect on centralized exchanges has led to increasing debates about its potential price impact on the token. However, crypto analyst MartyParty has ventured into the heart of the discussion, trying to clear the air. The analyst shed light on FTX’s SOL position in a revealing tweet. Highlighting the intricacies, the analyst stated that many of these holdings, linked to FTX’s sister company Alameda, consist of staked SOL tokens. These, crucially, remain locked until 2025. This is Alamedas Solana wallet which has the rights to the 26,740,743 staked $SOL from 2025-2028. This wallets keys will be sold in the FTX liquidation. Not the $SOL which cannot be unlocked until 2025-2028. As Ive been posting for weeks – FTX/Alameda only hold 7m $SOL and… pic.twitter.com/WeIkCKf2Ek — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) September 13, 2023 As a result, any immediate liquidation involving these tokens remains off the table. MartyParty also emphasized that the imminent FTX liquidation is solely for selling the wallet keys, not the wallet’s contents. Understanding The True Scope Of The Sale Further clarification by MartyParty indicates that when the staked tokens are set aside, FTX and Alameda only hold 7 million SOL and Wrapped SOL (wSOL). These are already slated for pre-sale to the Solana Foundation. In MartyParty words, “There is no more Solana to sell.” When viewing this in light of Solana’s daily trading volume, which fluctuates between 350 million and 450 million tokens, it’s evident that the market can comfortably absorb the FTX liquidation without significant disruption. To provide perspective, even a total liquidation of FTX’s SOL holdings at the current market rate would tally up to $128.6 million. Not to mention, the weekly sell-off cap set at $100 million further ensures market stability, according to MartyParty. MartyParty concluded his deep dive by emphasizing that no liquidation event in the past has significantly shaken the crypto market. It’s a “narrative spun to spur sales, with exchanges often capitalizing on the panic to buy low and sell high.” Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana At Make-Or-Break Moment, Key Levels To Watch Meanwhile, over the past 24 hours, Solana has been bullish.

The fundamentals have changed as network usage is down, and the chain continues to shed TVL. Among other things, I think the risks that can be witnessed in valuation and DeFi footprint now outweigh the reward or AVAX. When I last covered the Avalanche (AVAX-USD) blockchain in early June, I gave the native coin of the network a ""bullish"" call and noted what I viewed as a divergence between the AVAX price and the blockchain's usage. Since that article, it's been essentially nothing but pain for AVAX holders as the coin has declined by roughly 35% and has lagged notable smart contract network peers like Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Solana (SOL-USD): Data by YCharts My frustrations with the coin's performance aside, I think it's important to re-examine many of the factors that ultimately led me to go long AVAX in the first place to see if those setups still warrant a bullish position. Network Activity Back in June, I looked at daily transactions, daily active users, and NFT sales. Each of which were surging through April and May. That is no longer the case as we move through September. IntoTheBlock After topping out at over 500k transactions back in late May, it has been a slow decline back to trend for Avalanche transactions in the subsequent months. More importantly though, the surge in chain usage never impacted the AVAX price the way it did back in late 2021 and early 2022. Avalanche DAUs (Token Terminal) Daily active users on the network have fallen about 75% from the mid-June peak of 117k to the more recent level of 31-35k. When smoothing the figure out to a monthly average for DAUs, at 36k, so far September is the third consecutive monthly decline from 78k in June. As one might imagine, a large part of this decline in usage appears to be due to the declines in NFT activity on the network. Month Sales ((USD)) Unique Sellers Unique Buyers Total Txns Avg Sale ((USD)) September 2023 $75,171.39 1,546 4,926 12,003 $6.26 August 2023 $353,144.99 5,209 14,263 46,583 $7.58 July 2023 $461,909.51 16,789 19,159 81,675 $5.66 June 2023 $593,548.85 16,409 11,875 63,899 $9.29 May 2023 $774,626.36 11,089 5,888 35,685 $21.71 April 2023 $1,082,286.65 2,942 5,764 30,104 $35.95 Source: CryptoSlam There were over $1 million in USD-denominated NFT sales on Avalanche in April and the average sale price of those NFTs was over $35 per item. Fast-forward to August and the average price of NFT sales fell below $8. On one hand, this is an indication that Avalanche can indeed be used for lower-value transactions. Which is something Ethereum has yet to be able to do on the main layer to this point. However, the argument could also be made that even with more buyers, sellers, and NFT transactions in August versus April, AVAX holders haven't benefited from the increase in NFT-market headcount. Valuation One of the other things that I considered back in my June article was chain valuation. While I'll concede that all of these networks have egregious P/S valuations if we're comparing them to traditional equities, the ""crypto P/S"" valuation story on Avalanche had been improving earlier this summer. That is no longer the case. Avalanche P/S Ratio (Token Terminal) There are two different ways to measure the price-to-sales ratio of a smart contract blockchain network. We can look at the P/S ratio vs. the fully diluted coin supply or vs. the circulating coin supply. For the sake of simplicity, I've put both of those ratios in the chart above. Each of them have been gradually increasing over the last 4 months. The monthly average fully diluted P/S ratio was 483 in May. The monthly average circulating P/S ratio was 224. As of the article submission, those figures are currently 1,169 and 573 for the month of September. For a comparison, Ethereum trades at a fully diluted P/S ratio of 144 while Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) trades at 474. Development It isn't all terrible news for Avalanche, however. Over the last several years, Avalanche has seen steady growth in development activity. Avalanche Development (Santiment) Santiment's contributor count shows growth from a weekly average of 23 in August 2021 to 35 last August. That average grew slightly to 37 in August 2023. But the overall trend in both raw contributors and development activity is positive. Risks Aside from the decline in broad network usage and the valuation problems, there are other risks to consider as well. Avalanche has seen an absolutely enormous 95% decline in TVL from $11.6 billion in late 2021 to under $500 million currently: Avalanche TVL (DeFiLlama) The market capitalization of stablecoins on the network has also fallen from a high of $4.5 billion down to $1.2 billion. This is by no means a problem that is exclusive to just Avalanche but as I see it the decline in DeFi footprint on Avalanche is having an impact on the demand for AVAX. As interest rates rise, the incentive to buy bonds directly rather than playing in the DeFi markets becomes more apparent. AVAX Holder Concentration (IntoTheBlock) Furthermore, the retail holder base of AVAX is small compared to other smart contract blockchains like Ethereum or Cardano (ADA-USD). The IntoTheBlock chart above shows 47% of AVAX is held by whales and 31% is held by what IntoTheBlock considers to be investors. That means retail holds just 22%. I think it could be reasonably argued that AVAX is functioning more as a pure speculative asset than as a utility coin used to pay gas for network activity. Summary While I'm downgrading AVAX today from a ""buy"" to a ""hold,"" I haven't thrown in the towel on this network entirely. I still think there are interesting opportunities in the crypto market and Avalanche as a network continues to be one of those ideas. It's a fast chain that has integrations with many of the top protocols in the DeFi ecosystem. It serves a market that Ethereum requires secondary layers to serve at this current time. I'm not out of AVAX entirely, but I have trimmed my position on this adoption weakness and will reassess the idea again in the months to come.",NEGATIVE,AVAX | ETH,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4635226-avalanche-more-pain-ahead?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17641147.jpeg

17640822,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551264,1694710842,"Ethereum Leverage Ratio Is Rising, What Does It Mean?","Data shows the Ethereum leverage ratio has been going up recently, something that may lead to higher volatility for the asset’s price. Ethereum Estimated Leverage Ratio Has Risen To 23% Now As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Ethereum leverage ratio is pointing at increased risk in the market. The “estimated leverage ratio” (ELR) refers to the ratio between the Ethereum open interest and derivative exchange reserve. The former of these, the “open interest,” keeps track of the total amount of positions that are currently open in the ETH futures market, while the latter metric, the derivative exchange reserve, simply measures the number of tokens sitting in the wallets of all centralized derivative exchanges. The ELR basically tells us about how much leverage the average user on the futures market is currently opting for. When this indicator has a high value, it means that the open interest has a significant value compared to the exchange reserve, and so, the average contract is going for a high amount of leverage. Related Reading: Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Turns Highly Positive, Bullish Sign? On the other hand, low values imply that the futures market users aren’t willing to take risks at the moment as they haven’t taken any significant amount of leverage. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum ELR over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been heading up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant Historically, whenever the ELR has gone up, the price of the cryptocurrency has become more likely to show volatility. This is due to the fact that a higher amount of leverage means that the average contract becomes more likely to get liquidated. A large amount of liquidations happening at once can lead to chaos in the market, and since this is more likely to happen when the ELR is high, the price can naturally have a greater chance of turning volatile. As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum ELR had risen to some high values in August. As it usually plays out, this overleveraged market condition resulted in sharp price action for the asset, which, in this case, occurred in the form of a steep crash from the $1,800 level to the $1,600 level. The ELR quickly cooled down to relatively low values with the crash, as the positions with the most leverage were weeded out. For a while, the metric moved sideways at these lows, but recently, the indicator has once again started to rise. At present, the metric has a value of 23%, which isn’t as high as the pre-August crash value, but is still notable nonetheless. Huobi, Derbit, and OKX appear to have a disproportionate amount of leverage as compared to the wider sector, as the ELR for the platforms is currently 88%, 73%, and 43%, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wallet Activity Touches 5-Month High, Will BTC Price Follow? “When ELR increases, volatility tends to follow the same path,” notes the quant. “In this sense, Ethereum may be heading towards a period of increased turbulence.” ETH Price Ethereum had declined towards $1,500 at the start of the week but has since made recovery back above the $1,600 mark.

Team VESA has enjoyed the refreshing (too much so at times) weather of our native Finland and some interesting connections and projects have immediately sprouted. Currently, VESA is in Switzerland for a top Web3 conference with the fastest growing crypto ecosystem in the world, Crypto Oasis, but more on that a little later. First, it’s time to give a shoutout to a friend who is a fellow pioneer in the scene with a sold out project VESA is an advisor for. Link to project Selling out was just the beginning. Fusing art, culture, music, gaming, film, and AI, ‘SYNTHTOPIA’ is a creation of DESTABILIZED, an art collective founded by creative industry veteran ‘QVANTVM‘, with contributions from Scott Page, renowned for his work with Pink Floyd, and a network of strong partners who have contributed to award-winning AAA games, music, and films, from Cyberpunk 2077 to Batman, Warner Bros, HBO, Universal, Netflix, and Disney. SYNTHTOPIA Rewards Of course, the project offers a range of rewards to its holders, categorized into different tiers based on the number of NFTs held – from TRAILBLAZER (1-4 NFTs) to PROMETHEUS (200+ NFTs). Each tier unlocks a unique set of benefits including but not limited to discounts on merchandise, special roles on Discord, exclusive access to events, earning passive income, and having a major influence over the project’s direction. For example, TRAILBLAZER holders can access discounts and participate in airdrops and raffles, whereas PROMETHEUS holders can receive signed designer toys, lifetime free access to all events, and the opportunity to co-create projects or influence the direction of major endeavours. Other notable privileges for intermediate tiers include: Executive producer credits for music/film Major involvement in project direction Character voice roles for movies and animations Collaborative opportunities with top-tier artists in the ecosystem The potential to become a project advisor Masterclasses from creative talent All-expense-paid trips to live shows Passive income from merchandise, video streaming, IP licensing Unique 1/1 art pieces tailored for the collector Token airdrops from the Synthtopia ecosystem (third party) Music team collaborations More dynamic utilities TBA More links on the project: Website: www.synthtopia.world Discord: https://discord.com/invite/cErcnDh2YM The very cool Live performance from ETH Toronto: https://www.youtube.com/live/UnIZlFrFWIY?si=js0D6SgRUVw1BRtm&t=23105 VESA and QVANTVM are good friends and have collaborated on many projects.

Arte Marketplace is a highly curated platform that leverages the ecosystem. VESA’s new collection, Mirrors, is now featured on the platform, ready to be discovered.

A familiar face joining the Swiss Web3 Fest is Thomas Cermac from Cermac-Eisencraft gallery in the Czech Republic. His gallery that stands for impeccable taste and vision has represented VESA for a while now, and will soon be hosting the brand-new Mirrors- series at its location. More info on the Mirrors series here HER EXCELLENCY AND THE FINN TEAM One of the most prestigious fine art events in Finland, the Night of the Arts, took place again mid-August. VESA exhibited notably at the event and one of our most treasured friends and patrons, Her Excellency Amna Fikri, the UAE Ambassador of Finland, attended the event called “Art Before AI” Her Excellency enjoyed the virtual reality version a selection of the Veena Malik project. The entire Finn Team was also in attendance. Anita ‘Krypto Granny’ Kalergis, Pekka Kelkka aka Papa Blockchain and Elias Ahonen are all Finnish Web3 professionals, who most of the year influence in Dubai, so this was a rare treat. VESA and the rest of the Finn Team want to thank Her Excellency for visiting the exhibit and sharing the evening with us. WEB3 PLANS OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF FINLAND A fresh connection that kindled soon after returning to Finland courtesy of another Finnish Web3 enthusiast, Sointu Karjalainen, was meeting Johanna Eiramo, the Director of the Digital National Gallery in Finland. Johanna said that the iconic National Gallery is interested in energising its massive catalogue of works, digitizing, and possibly turning them into NFTs. We touched upon how these iconic institutions already have precious physical real estate and presence in the real world but are now turning their attention to their presence in the Metaverse and how to utilize technology going forward. We enjoyed the exhibit on the day and look forward to seeing what the future holds for this collaboration. VESA did a presentation at Sointu’s web3 gathering in Tampere in October THE DEEPEST WISH On a rare occasion, passion and profession collide. A community that has been incredibly important for team VESA is ISKCON, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and especially our local Helsinki temple. During the biggest celebration of the year, the Sri Krishna Janmashtami, VESA presented a work called The Deepest Wish, portraying some of the spiritual themes paramount to a path of God consciousness. The objective was to auction the 1/10 artwork and donate the proceedings to the temple, since they had been struck with a large bill for the temple’s electrical repairs. To our great delight, after being introduced to the stage by the temple president Tapo Divyam Das, Mr. Veer Ji Wangoo immediately bought the 1/10 artwork and we got to connect with him off stage. Hopefully this project continues to serve the community and give thanks to God who ultimately gives us the talent and intelligence to pursue these extraordinary life paths.

42392591,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8Wbx,1694708648,Dueling Digital Dollar Bills Debated in Congressional Hearing on U.S. CBDC,"Several House bills are racing to head off a CBDC in the U.S., though a key Democrat wrote one that would set up a digital dollar pilot.  A Thursday hearing hashed out the implications of a government token, though there's little headway in the Biden administration toward actually suggesting one.  The idea of a digital dollar in the U.S. is so egregious to Republican lawmakers that it’s become a presidential campaign talking point and the subject of multiple bills to strangle it before it takes a first breath. But Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) reintroduced a bill Thursday calling for a related digital dollar pilot.  His pitch came the same day the House Financial Services Committee’s panel on digital assets examined the general notion of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), often described as a digital dollar, though the version suggested by Lynch – the crypto subcommittee's top Democrat – wouldn't be issued by the central bank. But Thursday's hearing agenda was also linked to a series of Republican bills that would ban CBDCs – including one that would prevent the government from being able to even run a pilot program to see how the government-backed token would work.  “As digital payment and currency technologies continue to rapidly expand and with Russia, China, and nearly 130 countries worldwide already researching and launching some form of Central Bank Digital Currency, it is absolutely critical for the U.S. to remain a world leader in the development and regulation of digital currency,” Lynch said in a Thursday statement about his bill.  His ECASH Act would call for a pilot program in the Treasury Department for developing a digital U.S. dollar that he said at the hearing would complement a Fed-issued CBDC and make progress toward better financial inclusion for citizens now outside the financial system.  Meanwhile, the Digital Dollar Pilot Prevention Act pushed by Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.V.), another member of the committee, explicitly opposes a government testing ground for CBDCs.  A U.S. CBDC would be issued by the Federal Reserve and operate like a purely digital counterpart to the nation’s hard currency, though there are plenty of questions of how transactions would be handled, tracked and even limited by the watchdogs. The idea is in the very early stages of research, Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Michael Barr said recently, and he vowed that the central bank wouldn’t take a step forward without signoff from the White House and an authorizing bill from Congress – which would need a significant degree of Republican support that’s unlikely to be forthcoming at this stage.  Lynch invited fellow lawmakers to a new Congressional Digital Dollar Caucus at the hearing, though Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), the subcommittee's chairman, said, ""There is no support for a CBDC in Congress except from those on the fringes who think somehow a CBDC might be an amazing solution to many unstated global problems.""  Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), a staunch crypto ally who is also majority whip in the House leadership, has his own bill – with 50 cosponsors – to stamp out a retail CBDC in the U.S., reintroduced this week.  “If not designed to be open, permissionless, and private – emulating cash – a government-issued CBDC is nothing more than a CCP-style surveillance tool that would be used to undermine the American way of life,” he said in a statement, accusing President Joe Biden’s administration – even in the absence of any actual policy – of trying to set up a surveillance state to monitor citizens’ transactions.  Despite Republican talking points that have reached the battlefield of the 2024 presidential contest, the Biden administration hasn’t yet proposed a CBDC in any form. Fed and Treasury Department officials have said they’re looking into the technology, which was rapidly embraced by a handful of nations, including China.

Paxos Comes Forward As Guilty Party Paxos, a New York-based blockchain infrastructure company and the issuer of PayPal USD (PYUSD) and Pax Dollar (USDP), recently admitted responsibility for a substantial $510,000 Bitcoin fee payment, the highest fee ever paid in US dollars for a single Bitcoin transaction. Related Reading: This Latest Move Suggests SEC Lawsuit Against Ripple Is Pushing The Crypto Firm Outside The US The story began when several blockchain sleuths noticed the abnormally high Bitcoin network transaction fee of 19.89 BTC attached to a relatively small Bitcoin transfer of 0.074 BTC. Usually, BTC network fees range from $1-$5 and sometimes $50 when network activities are high, so the fee instantly piqued interest. An analysis by an X (formerly Twitter) user, Mononautical claimed that the entity behind the overly paid Bitcoin fee transaction was PayPal because the address behind the transaction was similar to one tagged as PayPal on OXT, a mobile block explorer for Bitcoin. In light of these rumors, Paxos has come forward to debunk the statement, clarifying that it was indeed an error on their part. Paxos has stated that the substantial BTC fee was caused by a bug error on the Bitcoin transfer. However, the blockchain infrastructure company has begun making plans to reclaim the lost funds from BTC miners involved in the transfer. “Paxos overpaid the BTC network fee on Sept. 10, 2023. This only impacted Paxos’ corporate operations. Paxos clients and end users have not been affected and all customer funds are safe,” the blockchain service provider said. BTC price holds $26,300 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Miners Contemplate Refund Presently, Bitcoin miners are contemplating refunding the significant Bitcoin network fee paid by Paxos for a 0.074 BTC transfer. The mining company involved in the transfer was Stakefish, a leading validator for proof of stake blockchains. The CEO and Founder of Stakefish, Chun Wang announced in a post on X that the individual behind the overly paid BTC fee transaction should come forward and reclaim their funds within three days. Following the announcement, a claim was made after three days, however, Wang has been uncertain about releasing the Bitcoin fee funds. He stated that he felt contrite about giving consent to the reimbursement and asked if he should split the funds between miners and Paxos. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Will Be By End Of Year A few members of the crypto community had suggested distributing the funds to miners, while others proposed splitting the funds equally between Paxos and miners. All things considered, the loss of the Bitcoin fee funds has been a huge blow to Paxos, raising concerns about the firm’s security. The crypto infrastructure provider has also been on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) radar, for allegedly infringing several investor protection laws in issuing the BUSD stablecoin.

42392601,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8XWN,1694706300,The Tokenization of Assets Is Underway,"Sixteen trillion dollars. That’s the forecasted value of real world assets expected to be tokenized by 2030. On-chain analytics show that $3 billion in assets are already tokenized. We already see big firms (BNY Mellon, JP Morgan and BlackRock) tout tokenization projects, recognizing the efficiencies they can bring from a payment and settlement perspective. Still, the more significant potential of tokenized investments is their ability to democratize finance and bring broader investment opportunities to the general population through “fractionalized"" investments in global opportunities.  Today, Peter Gaffney from Security Token Advisors provides an overview and insights into what’s happening in the world of tokenization in 2023.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  The State of Tokenization: Themes in 2023  Asset tokenization can be summed up by the concept and execution of bringing traditional assets to the blockchain (on-chain) as the next leg of financial product wrappers. As the broader public financial markets transitioned from individual stocks and bonds to mutual funds to ETFs – driven by newfound efficiencies and portfolio management precision – blockchain-based securities hold much promise as the next wrapper for private and public markets alike.  Throughout 2023, the key themes on this side of digital assets held strong, more or less, across the retail and institutional levels. The year picked up where 2022 left off regarding investment banking activity. Banks like Goldman Sachs, UBS, HSBC and ABN AMRO were all active issuers of digital bonds throughout this time. For example, after teasing a $104 million European Investment Bank (EIB) pilot through its bond issuance platform, Goldman Sachs officially launched the Goldman Sachs Digital Asset Platform (GS DAP) in January 2023, roughly two months after HSBC launched its Orion platform. GS DAP was then responsible for the $102 million digital Green Bond with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and presumably has additional issuances lined up with the current actively issuing banks like Societe Generale, EIB, Santander and Union Investment, who even captured 15 additional basis points (~$156,000) as the primary purchaser of Goldman’s inaugural EIB issuance. This number will likely only increase with the size of these issuances and full end-to-end digital onboarding, servicing, and management.  Beyond proprietary bank platforms, the industry saw Jefferies re-enter the space after a three-year hiatus, acting as an underwriter alongside Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in a 3,568 loan $237 million Provenance Blockchain-based HELOC, the first blockchain-based HELOC to receive a rating from a major agency (Morningstar, in this case). Aside from some of these blue-chip names, boutique banks and broker-dealers have been upgrading their own licensing in favor of the digital future, with firms like Dalmore Group, Castle Placement, Bosonic Securities, and even OTC Markets Group, who’s responsible for an existing 10,000 OTC securities, now supporting digital asset securities (blockchain-based products).  More pertinently to advisors, perhaps, is what’s happening on the money market & treasury fund side and the private equity & private credit side - two very different investment profiles, yet two symbiotic cohorts here. Tokenized money markets and treasuries have now surpassed $650 million in collective AUM, essentially acting as a low-risk yield-generating vehicle to park capital in a digital system. That’s all. As new opportunities open up, such as in the alternatives space, it’ll be more seamless to swap from on-chain money markets to on-chain private equity, for instance, than to swap from a traditional money market fund, wait for the fiat money transfer, and rotate into the PE product. That’s a very barebones sample, but it’s one that firms are actively developing end-to-end digital interfaces for. One prominent example specifically bringing this reality to financial advisors, RIAs, and the wealth management industry is Securitize, which originally partnered with Onramp Invest before acquiring it in August 2023 with the goal of enabling alternative investments alongside digital assets.  The near-term goal is rotating stablecoin and cryptocurrency holders into tangible, traditional investment products, fully on-chain. With the security token and tokenized asset secondary markets at a global $15 billion in market cap (Source: Security Token Market) across real estate, pre-IPO shares, investment funds, and other asset classes, there’s plenty of room to run as the ecosystem becomes more and more digital. Money markets and treasuries are the low-hanging fruit for familiarization as the industry builds more robust solutions on the alternatives side.  – Peter Gaffney, Head of Research at Security Token Advisors  Ask an Advisor: Call for Questions  Globally, advisors are being asked questions by clients surrounding digital assets every day.

In a recent report, Nicholas Merten predicts that Ethereum has less than a year to break free from an ascending triangle pattern, a technical indicator that holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. Related Reading: Tron Shows Might With 4.8-M Daily Transactions – Will This Boost TRX Price? The Enigma Of The Ascending Triangle Pattern In a nutshell, an ascending triangle pattern is a chart formation that typically indicates an impending breakout. It forms when the price of an asset reaches higher lows, forming a rising trendline (the ascending side of the triangle), while facing resistance at a horizontal level (the flat top of the triangle). The longer the pattern persists, the more pressure builds for a decisive price move, either upwards or downwards. Merten, a prominent voice in the crypto community, has been closely monitoring Ethereum’s performance against this crucial pattern. According to Merten, Ethereum’s inability to convincingly breach the resistance at around $2,000 is a cause for concern. “Ethereum cannot show up to the plate. It keeps getting shot down at around $2,000, and that’s okay for a while,” he emphasized.” But eventually, you’ve got to be able to either break out to the upside or, if you break through the ascending line of support to the downside, that spells bad news.” ETHUSD trading at $1,622 as of Thursday, Sept. 14. Chart: TradingView.com The Ethereum Exodus And Ambiguous Implications Meanwhile, a separate report has presented a puzzling trend that adds to the uncertainty surrounding Ethereum. Approximately 640,000 ETH has recently exited exchanges, a move that could be interpreted as a bullish sign. This outflow suggests that investors might be hoarding Ethereum for the long haul, anticipating a future price surge. However, caution is warranted. Ethereum’s long-term performance has not been impressive, with persistent bearish trends weighing it down. This raises questions about the credibility of the accumulation theory. While investors might be tempted to stock up on Ethereum at its current lower price point, they must tread carefully given the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Tally Spring Highs After Correction? Top Analyst Shares His Views At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,619, displaying a 1.7% gain over the past 24 hours, yet nursing a 1.0% loss in the seven-day period, according to CoinGecko. The coming months will likely determine whether Ethereum will defy the odds, break free from its current constraints, and soar to new heights — or if it will succumb to the pressures outlined by Merten, leading to a collapse that could reshape the crypto landscape.

As expected, it contains some interesting tales of Musk’s involvement with the meme coin Dogecoin and how he has contributed to its growth. Musk’s Love For Dogecoin Runs Deep Musk’s biography, authored by Walter Isaacson, contains certain important parts that highlight how much the world’s richest man is invested in the token. In one part, Isaacson writes that Musk’s brother discussed the possibility of creating a blockchain-based social media platform that would include a payment system using Dogecoin. Related Reading: By The Numbers: How Much Crypto Has Been Lost In The CoinEx Hack So Far Musk thought it was a great idea and even sent his brother an idea for “a blockchain social system that does both payments and short messages like Twitter.” Considering that it will be decentralized, Musk stated that it will guarantee free speech (something which Musk has continuously advocated for). The other option that Musk mentioned instead of this idea was to buy Twitter, which he eventually did. However, considering that the initial idea was to create a decentralized social system with Dogecoin being an integral part of the payment system, it won’t be surprising to see Musk incorporate the meme coin into the payment system he intends to build on the X (formerly Twitter) platform. Musk is known to post cryptic memes about Dogecoin usually. Still, his wittiness towards the meme token doesn’t stop there, as he went as far as purchasing a Shiba Inu dog named Floki, which happens to be Dogecoin’s logo. In February, he posted a tweet of this pet dog with the caption, “The new CEO of Twitter..” According to the book, FTX’s CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was in support of Musk acquiring Twitter as he believed that Twitter could be rebuilt on the blockchain and was “eager” to be part of the deal. Last year, Musk confirmed that SBF wanted to finance his Twitter takeover, but he wasn’t so inclined to the idea as SBF had “set off his bullshit meter.” The world’s richest man considered the idea of using blockchain technology as a support system for Twitter. However, it seems that Musk’s love for Dogecoin didn’t translate to him being a huge fan of blockchain technology. Isaacson stated that “despite the fun he had with Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, he was not a blockchain acolyte and he felt it would be too sluggish to support fast-paced Twitter postings.” DOGE price still trading sideways at $0.06 | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com DOGE Is An Investment Beyond his fondness for the meme token, Musk is reportedly invested in Dogecoin’s development. A page in the book revealed that Musk had been funding the cryptocurrency, with Isaacson labeling Dogecoin “the semi-serious cryptocurrency whose development he [Musk] had been quietly funding.” As such, it won’t be surprising to see Musk work towards ensuring that the meme token attains new heights, with a prominent member of the Dogecoin community positing that Elon Musk will make the token “the official currency of X and earth in the future.” Related Reading: Why The NASDAQ’s Latest Move Is Important For Fund Managers Filing Ethereum ETFs While this may seem farfetched to many, Musk is already taking steps that could place Dogecoin on the global stage. His X platform recently acquired licenses to offer payment services in multiple states in the US. This move could undoubtedly form part of Musk’s plans to create a payment system where users make payments in DOGE.

The staking landscape has faced criticism in recent months because the process used to secure the Ethereum blockchain is run largely by centralized staking providers.  Staking infrastructure company ssv.network is today releasing a blockchain it says will help decentralize staking for Ethereum and other blockchains to counter concerns the process is dominated by a few large participants.  The SSV mainnet is the largest implementation of a staking network that uses a Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) Network, the developers said.  The launch comes as staking, the process used to secure the Ethereum blockchain, is run largely by centralized staking providers, which together hold more than 70% of the staked ether (ETH) supply. These include a number of centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken holding just about 18% of the total staked ETH. Liquid staking providers such as Lido, RocketPool, Stader and Stakewise account for more 36% – with Lido accounting for the lion’s share.  Both liquid and exchange-based staking are fundamentally centralized and custodial, though protocols may include multiple separate operators. That concentration has sparked concerns in the broader crypto community  “Together with the partners and the community, SSV Network can usher in a new paradigm for Ethereum staking,” Alon Muroch, protocol lead at ssv.network, said in a message to CoinDesk. “Our goal is to onboard even more users who would be otherwise wary of trusting single entities, while not wanting to go through the relatively complex process of staking independently.”  SSV circumvents centralization concerns by allowing the sharing of a validator – an on-chain entity controlling 32 ETH via a network – with multiple underlying operators responsible for creating blocks, the data sets that comprise the blockchain. The company built the system in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation (EF) after more than two years of intense research and development, kickstarted by an EF grant in early 2021.  Each validator is controlled by a rotating set of registered operators, a process that requires no external coordination and is governed by SSV smart contracts. In contrast, current staking providers operate as single entities that pool tokens from their users.  SSV’s mainnet launch will see more than 10 teams deploying their staking dapps on the network. The initial ones will include Stader, Ankr, Stakestar, 01node, Metapool, StakeTogether, XHash, Chainup, Coindelta and Claystack.",POSITIVE,ETH | SSV,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | SSV,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/14/ether-staking-landscape-gets-boost-as-ssv-mainnet-seeks-to-dispel-centralization-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b40005230dfabe3e751e9658f2f605061cc3fa8-5760x3240.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392600,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8XRF,1694696531,First Mover Americas: BTC Holds $26K; Hedera’s HBAR Jumps,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose slightly on Thursday as traders digested concerns of a ruling in the FTX court case that temporarily spooked markets earlier this week. BTC added less than 1% over the past 24 hours to trade over $26,300 at the time of writing. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) and Solana’s SOL led gains amongst major tokens, rising 6% and 3%. Hedera announced on Wednesday at Token 2049 in Singapore that Stablecoin Studio, its open-source stablecoin issuance and management toolkit, is live. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based index that tracks the prices of hundreds of tokens, rose 1.67% in the past 24 hours.  Crypto exchange FTX can sell and invest its crypto holdings to pay back creditors, a judge in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware ruled Wednesday. In a court hearing, Judge John Dorsey said he approved the motion and overruled two objections that were made opposing the plan. This allows the bankrupt exchange to sell, stake and hedge its crypto holdings, which it said are worth over $3.4 billion. An attorney representing the ad hoc committee of FTX customers supported the plan during the hearing, while a lawyer for the unsecured creditors committee said all of the involved parties looked to expedite the process. ""The sooner we can get this process rolling, the better,"" he said.  Singapore’s financial regulator issued a nine-year prohibition order against the founders of Three Arrows Capital prohibiting them from operating in the country’s regulated financial services industry. Su Zhu and Kyle Davies will be prohibited from performing any regulated activity and from taking part in the management of, acting as a director of, or becoming a substantial shareholder of, any capital market services firm. MAS says the prohibition order comes after the regulator began investigating Three Arrows Capital after it reprimanded the fund in June 2022 for providing false information to the public and the role Zhu and Davies played in Three Arrows’ Singapore and British Virgin Island entities.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows open interest in perpetual futures contracts tied to solana (SOL). Open interest refers to the number of contracts active at a given time.  Open interest has jumped 35% to a two-month high of 16.25 million SOL in one week.  The surge, representing an influx of money in the market, comes as investors brace for FTX creditor liquidations.  Bankrupt exchange FTX holds around $7 billion in assets, including $1.16 billion in SOL and $560 million in bitcoin.

17633586,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551329,1694696420,"Polygon 2.0 Roll Out Officially Begins, Is MATIC Set For A Major Surge?","Polygon Labs announced today the roll out of their ambitious Polygon 2.0 implementation. The announcement, made via a tweet, marks the release of three pivotal Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) and a detailed roadmap for phase 0. “The wait is over. Polygon 2.0 implementation kicks off now,” the tweet reads, signaling the beginning of a new era for the platform. Earlier this summer, Polygon Labs had unveiled their vision for Polygon 2.0, a roadmap that aims to scale Ethereum blockspace to create what they term as the “Value Layer of the Internet.” This transformative vision promises unlimited scalability and unified liquidity. To bring this vision to fruition, a series of upgrades to the Polygon protocol architecture are imperative. Phase 0, announced today, is the first step in this direction. Phase 0 focuses on four main upgrades to the protocol: The transition from MATIC to POL. Establishing POL as the native (gas) token for PoS. Designating POL as the staking token for PoS. The introduction of the Staking Layer, a feature that will empower validators to secure a diverse range of chains within the evolving Polygon 2.0 ecosystem. What Phase 0 Of Polygon 2.0 Brings Polygon Labs has indicated that if the community endorses these proposals, the implementation could begin as early as the fourth quarter of this year. It’s noteworthy that the changes detailed in the first three PIPs are designed to be seamless, ensuring no disruptions for end-users at this stage. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Drops Below Crucial Level – Will Sellers Exit? An official blog post, also released today, provides deeper insights into the transformative journey of Polygon 2.0, which was first introduced to the public in June. This set of proposed enhancements seeks to revolutionize nearly every facet of the Polygon ecosystem. The three PIPs released today offer a comprehensive blueprint for phase 0. Their goal is to construct a network of interconnected zero-knowledge-powered L2 chains, effectively scaling Ethereum to the vast expanse of the Internet. Central to these PIPs is the transition process, the specifications for the revamped token of the Polygon 2.0 architecture, and crucial updates to the Polygon PoS native token. PIP-18, titled “Polygon 2.0 Phase 0,” offers a comprehensive overview of the initial phase, detailing the upgrades that will be further elaborated upon in subsequent PIPs. The milestones of phase 0 are crafted with the user in mind, ensuring minimal disruptions for those already operating on Polygon PoS and Polygon zkEVM chains. Related Reading: Polygon Foundation Refutes Claims Of Dumping MATIC On Binance – Here’s What Happened Meanwhile, PIP-17 delves into the intricacies of the POL token, outlining the associated contracts that will oversee its emission and migration. The POL token is not just a new name; it represents a next-generation token designed to accommodate an ecosystem of ZK-based Layer 2 chains, enabling staking, community ownership, and governance. Lastly, PIP-19 focuses on the transition of the native gas token on Polygon POS from MATIC to POL. This transition is designed to ensure maximum compatibility with existing systems, with the native token’s properties remaining unchanged. MATIC Price Analysis The MATIC price currently remains in a downtrend channel that saw its beginning in mid-February this year. MATIC hit its yearly high of $1.56 on February 13 and has fallen 68% since then. However, a look at the 1-week chart shows that there is hope for MATIC bulls. At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at 0.5184. All it would take to breathe new life into the MATIC price is a move above $0.5855. This price level marks the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level, in addition, a move above this price would signify a breakout from the downtrend channel. The bulls could regain the upper hand and target the 20-week EMA at $0.7007. Another key resistance level is at $0.7698, where the 200-day EMA is located. A rise to this price level would already represent a 45% rally. As then, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.9435 could be targeted by the bulls. Major selling pressure can also be expected at $1.27 (23.6% Fibonacci retracement level) before the yearly high would be within reach. Polygon 2.0 clearly has the potential to awaken the bulls from their slumber. However, the $0.5855 price level is the critical key. If MATIC fails at this price level, a sweep of 65-week low at $0.3177 could loom.

Liquid staking has become a popular way for investors to earn yields on their digital assets, making it one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors with $16 billion of value combined, per data from DefiLlama. Liquid staking platforms, including Lido, allow users to keep their locked-up tokens liquid with a derivative token that can be used for lending and borrowing.  Lido’s stETH has a $13.8 billion market capitalization, and the tokens are available in two types: a rebasing token, stETH, and a wrapped, auto-compounding token, wstETH, which will be used to bridge to Cosmos.  Lido has picked cross-chain platform Neutron and full-stack development network Axelar for the bridging project, CoinDesk learned Thursday. Neutron and Axelar have each committed 1% of their respective token incentives to build liquidity for wrapped stETH and wstETH.  “We are excited to be part of the effort to bring one of the biggest liquid staking tokens, Lido’s staked ETH to the Cosmos ecosystem,” Avril Dutheil, core contributor to Neutron, said in a message to CoinDesk. “It is a reflection of the value of cross-chain support and our commitment to bringing liquidity and users to the Cosmos ecosystem.”  Once on Cosmos, the wstETH token can be used on several blockchains that are built on Cosmos’ Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) technology platform.

Recently, as the altcoin market experienced a significant selloff, DOGE found itself caught in the turmoil, succumbing to substantial outflows earlier in the week. This downturn had a critical consequence, as it sent the coin’s price plummeting below a crucial support trendline that had been instrumental in propping up DOGE for over three weeks. As the market sentiment shifted, this breakdown raised concerns about the future trajectory of Dogecoin, hinting at a possible continuation of the downtrend and further price declines. Related Reading: Tron Shows Might With 4.8-M Daily Transactions – Will This Boost TRX Price? Dogecoin Breakdown And Retest On a fateful Monday, DOGE’s price decisively breached the support trendline, taking a nosedive to reach a low of $0.0593. However, the cryptocurrency market is known for its swift and unpredictable moves, and DOGE was no exception. Bulls promptly rallied, pushing the price up in a retest of the very trendline that had turned into resistance. At the time of writing, the current DOGE price stands at $0.061452, with a 24-hour gain of 0.5% and a seven-day dip of 3.0%. DOGE seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko The critical question now is whether this retest phase will demonstrate the sustainability of DOGE’s price below the trendline. If it does, the outlook for Dogecoin, according to a price analysis, remains uncertain, with the potential for an additional decline of approximately 8%, targeting the $0.056 zone. Traders and investors are keenly watching this juncture, as it may dictate DOGE’s short-term future. Longer-Term Assessment On The Meme Coin Beyond the immediate challenges, some analysts have offered a longer-term perspective on Dogecoin. A separate report suggests a Dogecoin price prediction of $0.10 by the time the next decade rolls around, representing a major 68% increase. This prediction raises eyebrows, considering DOGE’s history of meteoric rises. However, it’s essential to remember that past performance in the fast-paced crypto world doesn’t always indicate future results. DOGE market cap still below $9 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The Dogecoin Dilemma While Dogecoin undeniably boasts a loyal fanbase and a handful of celebrity endorsements, it hasn’t showcased the same level of aggressive growth strategy or innovative features as some of its younger counterparts, like Shiba Inu. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, DOGE faces the challenge of staying relevant and competitive in a field where innovation and adaptability are highly prized. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Tally Spring Highs After Correction? Top Analyst Shares His Views And, as Dogecoin finds itself at a critical juncture, its price is teetering on a support-turned-resistance trendline.

42392586,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8W7B,1694692800,"Deutsche Bank to Delve Into Crypto Custody, Tokenization With Taurus","Deutsche Bank is working with Taurus, a Swiss startup specializing in cryptocurrency safekeeping, to establish digital asset custody and tokenization services, the companies said on Thursday.  Germany’s biggest lender, Deutsche Bank, said in June it had applied for a crypto custody license from the country’s financial watchdog, BaFin. The bank’s publicly known crypto custody ambitions stretch back to early 2021, when details about a digital asset custody prototype appeared in a report by the World Economic Forum.  Germany’s roll-out of rules for firms to custody crypto assets and, more broadly, Europe’s proposed regime for Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA) are providing traditional finance firms with the clarity needed to explore the digital assets industry.  Deutsche Bank invested in Taurus in February, part of a $65 million Series B round led by Credit Suisse that also included Arab Bank Switzerland and Pictet Group. Taurus co-founder Lamine Brahimi pointed out that Deutsche Bank’s due diligence of prospective crypto custody firms kicked off at the end of 2021 and ended sometime in 2022.  “We won the deal a couple of quarters ago, so the bank became a client and then decided to take a stake in Taurus,” Brahimi said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The partnership focuses on cryptocurrencies, but we are well known for going beyond cryptocurrencies. So, where it sees fit, the bank will be able to tokenize assets and provide asset servicing.”  Deutsche Bank’s global head of securities services, Paul Maley, said the plan is to develop digital asset custody services for a wide variety of digital asset types for corporate and institutional clients.  “In the first instance, we will offer custody for selected crypto currencies and some stablecoins. We expect the first wave of activity to be around these selected cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.

17629701,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551266,1694689217,Why This Crypto Exchange Founder Believes Bitcoin Can Still Rise 150% From Here,"The price of Bitcoin has fluctuated over the past month, but BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is the latest crypto expert to make a bullish forecast for the asset. According to the former CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, Bitcoin could reach $70,000, and the only reason the asset is not yet at this price is because investors are fixated on the Fed’s nominal rate. Bitcoin Can Still Rise 150% Various predictions have come in regarding Bitcoin, with some being more bullish than others. As for Hayes, he made his case regarding BTC in his Crypto Trader Digest blog post in light of various actions by the US Federal Reserve to curb inflation. Related Reading: This Latest Move Suggests SEC Lawsuit Against Ripple Is Pushing The Crypto Firm Outside The US Since March 2022, the Fed has raised interest rates multiple times, causing many investors like Hayes to reconsider their predictions regarding the outlook of Bitcoin. What happens if the Fed keeps raising rates? Can the $BTC bull market gain steam? “Are We There Yet?” is an essay exploring that question.https://t.co/OGkVQreIBg pic.twitter.com/FTYR3HBq1a — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) September 11, 2023 In the blog post, Hayes shared several metrics relating to the US treasury yield and GDP growth. Hayes began adjusting his forecasts by disputing the widely held belief that BTC’s value is negatively correlated with rising interest rates. A new outlook shows that the government’s spending rates and the current growth of GDP have driven down the actual treasury yield on 5% government bonds closer to 4%, making risky assets like BTC and stocks still attractive. Hayes believes the Fed will be able to continue down this path of raising rates, and investors’ search for positive real yields in response to this has translated into a bullish market for Bitcoin which began in March 2023. However, although Bitcoin is up by close to 29% since then, most of the market is still yet to catch on as everyone is focused on the nominal Fed rate and not the real rate. “The reason why we aren’t at $70,000 is that everyone is focused on the nominal Fed rate, and not on the real rate when compared to the U.S.’s eye-poppingly high nominal GDP growth.” BTC price trending above $26,300 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Price To $70,000? While speaking at the Korea Blockchain Week, Hayes mentioned that the next Bitcoin bull market started on March 10, the day the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took over Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Hayes has actually made similar predictions regarding Bitcoin. Back in March 2020, the pundit made a prediction Bitcoin could rise from $8,000 and reach $20,000 by the end of the year. BTC’s price would later close the year 2020 at around $27,000. Related Reading: SEC Boss Gary Gensler Completes Senate Hearing: Here’s What Crypto Investors Should Know The BitMEX co-founder has previously expressed his discomfort on Spot Bitcoin ETF, from investment companies like BlackRock, calling them “crypto gatekeepers” who are only looking to balance their deposit base. However, Hayes believes a catchup by the market would Bitcoin survive more interest rate raise from Fed to skyrocket more than 150% from its current level by early 2024. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $26,320 and is up by 2.27% in a seven-day timeframe.

The percentage of bitcoin's circulating supply active onchain within the last month fell to a record low of 5.4% early this week, according to Blockware Solutions and Glassnode. In other words, fewer coins are changing hands, indicating supply-side weakness. At press time, bitcoin's circulating supply was 19.48 million.  ""Price is set at the margin, which means those who trade Bitcoin back and forth drive short-term price action. As supply-side illiquidity continues to increase, as indicated by fewer supply exchanging hands, any demand catalyst will send the price skyrocketing,"" Blockware Solutions said in an email.  The percentage of circulating supply that has remained inactive for over a year stands near 70%.  Buy and hold remains a preferred strategy in the crypto market, with the so-called long-term holders controlling over 75% of the circulating supply. Glassnode defines long-term holders as addresses that hold coins for at least 155 days.  Awaiting bullish catalysts  Besides the potential spot bitcoin-exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch, which is several months away, macro and regulatory concerns favor the bears.

In addition, the bankrupt FTX exchange obtained court approval to liquidate its crypto holdings worth $3.4 billion as it looks to offset its debt. Normally, developments such as this are expected to induce a selling pressure on crypto assets. However, the majority of the market is staying afloat with slight gains in the last few hours, while Solana has even embarked on a rally, drawing much attention from investors. Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has given possible reasons as to why the crypto market may not be moving as widely expected. Most of FTX’s Solana Are Staked And Inaccessible – Analyst Explains According to an X post on Wednesday, Michaël van de Poppe states that there should not be much reaction from the crypto market despite the latest CPI data and the court approval for FTX’s liquidation. Related Reading: Solana Potential Rebound: Can Bulls Hit Their $30 Target? The analyst explains that most of the Solana, which makes up the bulk of the FTX crypto holdings, with a value of $1.2 billion, is currently staked and thus cannot be liquidated. Van de Poppe states that only 7 million SOL is available to FTX for liquidation, and most of these tokens have been sold in the past week. Given these circumstances, the analyst predicts a “sell the rumor, buy the news” scenario would likely occur. In relation to the other crypto holdings of FTX, Michaël van de Poppe states the exchange is only allowed to sell $200 million worth of assets per week. Furthermore, the current market prices have been factored on during the calculation of this liquidation rate; thus, it will likely not produce a high level of selling pressure. In addition to Solana, FTX also looks to liquidate other assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Aptos (APT), and XRP, among others. Van De Poppe’s Take On CPI Report Explaining the crypto market’s response to the latest CPI data, Michaël van de Poppe explains that while inflation rates rose higher than predicted in August, the core CPI value was 4.3% as expected, which is lower than July’s value of 4.7% Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana Takes Hit and Could Dive To $15 Therefore, the analyst postulates that the US Federal Reserve would likely not be introducing any interest rate hike. This is because the Fed is known to focus more on core CPI data, which provides a long-term outlook on the nation’s inflation rate. At the time of writing, Solana trades at $18.69, with a loss of 0.29% in the last hour based on data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, the token’s trading volume is up by 47.89% and is now valued at $446.52 million.

BTC rose 1.5% to trade over $26,100 in European morning hours on Thursday. Ether neared $1,700 before falling to $1,650. Xrp (XRP) and solana (SOL) led gains among major crypto tokens, rising as much as 3% before retreating.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based index that tracks the prices of hundreds of tokens, rose 1.67% in the past 24 hours.  Among mid-caps, THORChain’s rune (RUNE) bumped 6.8% as developers unveiled a way to allow cross-chain swaps of bitcoin via a tool built in collaboration with ShapeShift.  A jump in SOL came even as crypto exchange FTX revealed in bankruptcy court filings earlier this week that it holds $1.16 billion of SOL – approximately 16% of the token’s outstanding supply – and about $560 million in BTC. The rest of its holdings consist of lesser-known illiquid tokens.  On Wednesday, a judge in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware ruled that FTX could sell and invest its crypto holdings to pay back creditors.  SOL dropped up to 4% following the court ruling, but part of the stash is locked as venture investment and not available for sale. Aptos (APT), another token held by FTX, dropped nearly 2%.  Meanwhile, FxPro Senior Market Analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email that, generally, bearish sentiment remained intact among professional traders.  “The question is whether the recent dip will be the starting point for the next rally. Keep an eye on the activity near the recent highs; for now, the market is not allowed to go higher,” Kuptsikevich said.  “Despite the potential for a rebound, BTCUSD remains within the bearish momentum that has been in place since July, with lower and lower highs and lows,” he added. “Ether remains in a downtrend, although its intensity is decreasing.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | SOL | XRP,BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/14/xrp-sol-lead-slight-crypto-majors-recovery-after-ftx-sell-off-fears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1820368dbf46cb6d80d46f9a07c9d96d2966155-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The project, which was launched just six years ago, recently registered an impressive surge in transaction activity, underscoring the increasing organic demand for the TRX cryptocurrency. Recent data from a Nansen report reveals that Tron has been processing a remarkable average of over 4.8 million daily transactions, a testament to its rapid expansion within a relatively short period. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Tally Spring Highs After Correction? Top Analyst Shares His Views Driving Forces Behind Tron’s Surge Tron’s growth can be attributed primarily to its steadfast pursuit of utility and, notably, the burgeoning demand for cost-effective and reliable stablecoin transactions. The stablecoin marketcap has exhibited aggressive growth in 2023, reaching a pinnacle of over $45 billion between May and June, with daily transactions peaking at an impressive 13 million transactions around the same period. According to recent data from @nansen_ai, TRON is processing around 4.8M daily transactions! 🔥 We’re glad to see so many people using this network and we’re looking forward to increasing that number. 🚀 Take a look at more data here: https://t.co/weWHfWXz2k pic.twitter.com/z47TpyIRpQ — TRON DAO (@trondao) September 12, 2023 What’s particularly noteworthy is that these daily transaction volumes have been achieved during a relatively subdued phase in the cryptocurrency market, suggesting the potential for even higher transaction counts during bullish market conditions. This robust adoption underscores Tron’s resilience and appeal within the blockchain ecosystem. The cryptocurrency market has reacted positively to Tron’s outstanding performance. At the time of writing, TRX is priced at $0.081092, according to CoinGecko, showing a modest 0.8% gain over the past 24 hours and a 2.6% increase in the seven-day period. TRX market cap currently at $7.2 billion. Chart: TradingView.com FTX Liquidations Pose Potential Risks However, it’s essential to exercise caution as Tron continues its upward trajectory. According to cryptocurrency data provider Messari, TRX is one of the digital assets that could face price fluctuations due to impending FTX liquidations. FTX LIQUIDATIONS UPDATE FTX liquidators hold approximately $1.3 billion of liquid crypto assets (excluding stablecoins) which have been dragged down by fear of FTX liquidations potentially beginning Wednesday.

These holdings raise concerns about potential market volatility, as large liquidations can impact the price of these assets. Related Reading: Beyond XRP Euphoria And $0.5 Resistance: Bulls’ Next Steps Implications For The Future As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Tron’s pursuit of utility and its growing adoption rates indicate a promising future.

The DEX is one of the first non-custodial exchanges to be approved as a virtual asset service provider (VASP) by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, the firm said. It targets asset issuers that need compliance guarantees and controls, allowing secondary markets to exist for on-chain, or tokenized, real-world assets such as fixed income securities.  DEXs are blockchain-based apps that coordinate trading of digital assets between users. In the decentralized environment, users trade without surrendering custody of their assets – as they would have to for a centralized exchange – meaning that no one can misappropriate these digital assets. Mauve was developed in a direct response to the fallout from the collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX.  Mauve is a subsidiary of Violet, a compliance and identity infrastructure platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) backed by the digital assets unit of hedge fund giant Brevan Howard and the venture capital arm of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without using traditional intermediaries.  “We believe the future of finance is on-chain,” said Markus Maier, a co-founder of Mauve. “The foundation is our programmable compliance infrastructure, Violet, which we purpose-built for the needs of RWA issuers and institutional buyers,” he added, referring to real-world assets.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/14/violets-decentralized-exchange-mauve-goes-live-for-trading-compliant-and-real-world-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8effcce7f008709237fc6c73a6094d7ab0087a07-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17623095,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551237,1694677229,"XRP Price Set Theory Debunked By Community, Here’s What It’s About","In a recent series of exchanges on X, prominent XRP community influencer, Crypto Eri, addressed the controversial theory that the XRP price can be artificially set by a central authority. The debate has ignited discussions among enthusiasts, experts, and Ripple insiders. Eri’s initial tweet emphasized the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, stating, “Decentralized crypto-assets like XRP, cannot be ‘price set’. Price is determined by supply & demand dynamics in the global open market, sometimes with Influence factors like trading, sentiment, adoption, news & liquidity.” She further warned against the “deceptive false price hype” that has been circulating within the community. Can XRP Price Be Set? In a hypothetical scenario presented by a user, the idea of “setting the price” was explored, suggesting that if a powerful entity like OPEC decided to trade a barrel of oil for 1 XRP, it would effectively set the price. Eri responded, “Granted, artificial price setting has been tried, but If the price is above the equilibrium level, then the quantity supplied has always exceeded the quantity demanded… In the Crypto Market, you can’t ignore arbitrage.” Related Reading: Can Ripple Control The XRP Price? Crypto Analysts Weigh In Khaled Elawadi.XRP, another community member, argued that the tokens price could be set in different ways, either directly by Ripple or by determining a face value through various parties. Eri swiftly countered, clarifying the distinction between XRP, the XRP Ledger, and RippleNet, a software solution created by Ripple. She emphasized, “Fact 1: The digital asset XRP is not a unique software product… Fact 2: Ripple does not control XRP or the Ledger… Fact 3: Ripplenet is the name of a software created by the Company Ripple, that can use XRP (or any asset) in a solution.” Jesse Hynes, a renowned community lawyer, humorously questioned the persistence of the price set theory, “Are people still saying that there’s going to be a price set?”, to which Eri simply replied, “Yes.” Neil Hartner, a Senior staff software engineer at Ripple for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), weighed in on the debate as well, questioning the logic behind two parties artificially setting a price, stating, “Why would 2 parties do that unless they want to lose a lot of money? Unless those 2 parties are willing to defend the price and not run out of money, it won’t last.” Related Reading: Pro-XRP Legal Expert Takes The Spotlight With Daring Ripple Vs SEC Settlement Theory The debate took another turn when Vandell Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, drew parallels between XRP and gold, suggesting that the token could achieve a stable value similar to gold in the future. He cited the capped supply of 100 billion tokens as a potential factor for increased demand as the market matures. Another perspective emerged from a community member who believed that a decentralized asset’s price could be pegged or fixed, drawing comparisons to the former “gold window” of the Federal Reserve. They posited that entities like the IMF or Ripple could act as central authorities in such a scenario. As the debate continues, it’s clear that the community remains divided on the issue. While some believe in the potential for a centralized price setting, others, like Eri, firmly stand by the principles of supply, demand, and market dynamics. At press time, XRP traded at $0.4806.

Data from derivatives market tied to APT show traders have grown bearish on the cryptocurrency.  The impending APT unlock is worth $103 million at the token's current market price of $5.15 and equals more than 8.5% of Aptos' circulating supply of 235.02 million.  Tokens are often locked to keep the big bag holders – early investors and project team members – from liquidating their holdings all at once, for such an act would crater the market value.  According to research firm The Tie, APT's November unlock will free up significant liquidity.  ""The significant token unlocks for investors and main contributors are scheduled for Nov. 11. The collective 20 million APT (equivalent to $106 million) to be unlocked then equates to 112% of the average daily trading volume over the prior 30 days,"" The Tie's weekly newsletter dated Sept. 13 said.  ""These unlocks will take place on a monthly basis and will coincide with monthly staking reward unlocks (5.83 million APT or 32% of the daily average volume, set to increase to 6.15 million APT in December). Additionally, since last year, 4.62 million APT have been unlocked monthly for community and foundation purposes,"" The Tie added.  The research firm said early this year that unlocks that free up liquidity, or those that represent over 100% of the average daily volume, tend to weigh over prices.  APT funding rates slide  The latest positioning data from the perpetual futures market tied to APT suggests crypto traders have grown bearish on the cryptocurrency.  Open-interest-weighted funding rates are now at their most negative since February. A negative rate implies that shorts are paying longs to keep their bearish bets open.

42392597,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8XBr,1694673531,Crypto Miners Debate $500K Bitcoin Fee Refund to Paxos for 'Fat-Fingers' Error,"Bitcoin miners are pondering the refund of a hefty $500,000 bitcoin (BTC) fee paid by crypto services company Paxos for a mere $2,000 bitcoin transaction earlier this week – an incident the latter blamed was “due to a bug.”  Paxos’ transaction was picked up by mining company Stake.fish, which uses its computing resources to mine and stake several networks. Stake.fish founder Chun Wang said in an X post earlier this week that whoever was behind that transaction had three days to claim the transaction and likely receive a refund.  A bitcoin fee is what a user pays to miners, or entities who maintain the network, to get their transaction included in the blockchain. The more a user pays, the higher the chance their transaction will be picked up immediately as miners are prioritize bigger payouts.  Paxos runs a crypto exchange and issues its own USDP stablecoins, making it one of the most sophisticated players in the industry.  Last Sunday, however, an apparent bug in the corporate operations side of the business led to a network fee of 20 bitcoin (worth just over $515,000 at the time) to send just 0.7 bitcoin (worth less than $2,000), Paxos said in an email to news outlets.  These fees usually range from $5 to $20, depending on network congestion and demand, as of Thursday.  Paxos likely reached out to Stake.fish to claim the fees. But in a Thursday post on X, Stake.fish’s Wang suggested the claim was made after the initial deadline, citing timezone differences.  “I was annoyed and regretted agreeing to refund that 20 BTC,” Wang said. “Especially when I saw the person claiming it kept saying EST instead of EDT/UTC. Last time a Zcash guy did that, I blocked his entire company.”  An X poll under Wang’s post seemed to gather community sentiment for the eventual decision. Of nearly 1,700 voters as of Asian afternoon hours, 37% felt the fees should be distributed to miners, 27% felt it should be returned to Paxos, 21% voted on freezing the bitcoin, while the remaining favored a 50% split between miners and Paxos.  “50/50 seems reasonable,” said @chjango, a Cosmos developer. “50% to miners in the network who should’ve gotten it otherwise. 50% back to paxos and let them appreciate the -50% cost of doing business and learn how to properly implement change outputs.”  “They’ve been around long enough to know better than to make such an amateur mistake.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/14/crypto-miners-debate-500k-bitcoin-fee-refund-to-paxos-for-fat-fingers-error,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d17e1aa20847546eb89a3e14d9b8692931e587cf-2560x1758.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $18.80 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it settles above the trend line and $20. Solana Price Eyes Bullish Breakout In the past few days, Solana’s price extended its decline below the $22 support. SOL even traded below the $20 level to move further into a bearish zone. Finally, it tested the $17.40 zone. A low was formed near $17.37 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $18.50 resistance zone. The price even spiked above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $20.60 swing high to the $17.37 low. However, the bears are protecting a close above the $19 resistance. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $18.80 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $20 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $19.00 level. The first major resistance is near the $19.40 level or the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $20.60 swing high to the $17.37 low. Source: SOLUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance is near $20. A clear move above the $20 resistance might send the price toward the $21.20 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $22 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to settle above $19.00 and $19.40, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $18.10 level. The first major support is near the $17.40 level. If there is a close below the $17.40 support, the price could decline toward the $16.50 support. In the stated case, there is a risk of more downsides toward the $15.00 support in the near term.

Su Zhu and Kyle Davies will be prohibited from performing any regulated activity and from taking part in the management of, acting as a director of, or becoming a substantial shareholder, of any capital market services firm, the release says.  MAS says the prohibition order comes after the regulator began investigating Three Arrows Capital after it reprimanded the fund in June 2022 for providing false information to the public and the role Zhu and Davies played in Three Arrows’ Singapore and British Virgin Island entities.  The regulator says that Three Arrows’ failed to notify MAS of the appointment of a new fund manager, falsely claimed to MAS that this manager wasn’t conducting regulated activities, and failed to have in place an appropriate risk management framework.  “Senior management of fund managers are required to implement robust risk management measures to protect the interest of investors,” Loo Siew Yee, Assistant Managing Director of Policy, Payments & Financial Crime said in a release. “MAS takes a serious view of Mr. Zhu’s and Mr. Davies’ flagrant disregard of MAS’ regulatory requirements and dereliction of their directors’ duties.

17609251,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=551218,1694653248,Bitcoin Unprecedented Liquidity And Rate Reversal: A Perfect Storm For Market Correction?,"Despite Bitcoin’s recent recovery to the key level of $26,100, signaling a crucial point for its future gains and preventing further decline, there are worrisome signals that could raise concerns for Bitcoin bulls in the short term. The combination of factors presents a potential perfect storm for a market correction. One contributing piece is the higher-than-expected US August headline inflation, coming in at 3.7% up from the previous month’s 3.2%. Although not a game-changer, it implies that the odds of another rate hike are marginally up, now standing at 53%. Jeroen Blokland, a multi-asset investor, highlights this development. Additionally, Bloomberg’s senior macro strategist, Mike McGlone, suggests that Bitcoin may be leading a downward trend. McGlone emphasizes that Bitcoin is an “exceptionally liquid” asset that has experienced significant appreciation without being tied to specific projects or liabilities. However, since it emerged during a period of historically low-interest rates, its position as a potential frontrunner for a market reversion is noteworthy. US Inflation Data And Rising Interest Rates Pose Challenges For Bitcoin Bull Run One key indicator highlighted by McGlone is the rollover of Bitcoin’s 20-week moving average (MA), which has implications for all risk assets. Related Reading: DCG And Gemini Ink A Plan: Users To Receive All Their Crypto? Being one of the best-performing assets in history, Bitcoin’s reversion lower is a significant observation. McGlone’s analysis reveals that federal funds futures for the next year hover above 5%, indicating limited expectations for liquidity from the Federal Reserve (Fed). A similar pattern was observed in Bitcoin’s mean reversion at the beginning of 2022 when futures began pricing for the current tightening cycle. As the lower bound of the federal funds rate rapidly rises from zero to 5.2% and is expected to continue increasing, significant pressure on all risk assets, including Bitcoin, may ensue. McGlone also highlights the historical relationship between Bitcoin and the broader market. Following the liquidity injection resulting from the shift to zero interest rates in early 2020, Bitcoin’s 20-week moving average reached its bottom before the S&P 500 experienced a similar trend in the third quarter of that year. Mike McGlone’s analysis raises concerns about Bitcoin’s future performance amid changing interest rate dynamics and the potential impact on all risk assets. As Bitcoin’s 20-week moving average shows signs of rolling over, investors and market participants will closely monitor its price trajectory and its ability to withstand the pressures of rising interest rates. BTC’s Battle With Resistance, Will It Break Through Or Face A Seven-Month Low? At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency in the market, Bitcoin (BTC), is facing a challenge in surpassing the resistance wall at $26,400, as highlighted by NewsBTC. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has managed to gain a modest 0.3%, while the most significant gains in the last 30 days have occurred within the seven-day timeframe, with a modest surge of 1.9%. Should BTC succeed in surpassing its immediate resistance, it will encounter the formidable 200-day and 50-day moving averages (MA) at levels of $27,000 and $27,100, respectively. These levels pose significant hurdles for the cryptocurrency’s prospects and potential future gains. Related Reading: This Latest Move Suggests SEC Lawsuit Against Ripple Is Pushing The Crypto Firm Outside The US Conversely, if BTC experiences an extended decline and relinquishes its current modest gains, Bitcoin bulls must closely monitor the crucial threshold at the $25,150 level.
