This pattern suggests a lack of dominance from buyers or sellers, indicating uncertainty in the market regarding the direction of the trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Lower Timeframe Outlook: $26,800 Breakthrough Could Spark Rally The recent legal actions taken by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against prominent crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase could contribute to this hesitation among market participants. As a result, the Terra classic coin is anticipated to undergo a prolonged period of consolidation in the upcoming days, as the overall trend remains bearish due to the influence of a wedge pattern. LUNC Price Analysis, Impact Of Regulatory Actions On Crypto Market In the midst of regulatory actions taken against major crypto exchanges, caution and uncertainty have permeated the cryptocurrency market, impacting traders and investors alike. This climate of uncertainty is reflected in the LUNC price chart, where alternating green and red candles indicate a lack of clear dominance from buyers or sellers. As market participants await further clarity and resolution regarding the regulatory actions, hesitation in making significant moves has emerged. Consequently, the Terra classic coin is expected to undergo a period of consolidation, characterized by a relatively stable price, as market participants reassess the situation and evaluate the potential implications of the legal actions on the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Related Reading: Bleak Dogecoin (DOGE) Social Sentiment Raises Questions About Price Reversal However, it is worth noting that if the LUNC price continues its upward trajectory, it may potentially lead to a retest of the overhead trendline. A successful break above this trendline would serve as a pivotal signal, indicating the beginning of a new recovery rally for LUNC. Such a breakout would represent a shift in market sentiment and attract more buyers into the market, potentially altering the course of the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory. As the market dynamics continue to unfold, traders and investors will closely monitor the price action of LUNC, paying particular attention to the development of the wedge pattern and the resolution of regulatory actions. These factors will play a crucial role in shaping the future direction of LUNC and the broader cryptocurrency market. Will LUNC Price Rise To $0.00012? Affected by the descending wedge pattern, the LUNC price remains bearish, with the recent reversal signaling a possible decline. This downward movement could lead the price towards crucial support levels at $0.000082 and $0.00007, followed by a lower trendline. On the other hand, a recovery above $0.00012 would require buyers to break above the aforementioned trendline successfully. Currently, the coin is trading at $0.00008718 and appears to be moving sideways, indicating a lack of clear direction from market participants.

In the last 24 hours alone, the price has fallen by 21.51%. However, there is a glimmer of hope as the price slightly increased by 1.53% in the past hour. Currently priced at $0.58 per SUI, the token is 61.12% below its all-time high of $1.50. The question now remains whether SUI can regain its footing and initiate a recovery. SUI Coin Faces Bearish Pressure The global crypto market cap has dropped below $1.10 trillion again, leading to a negative trading sentiment across most cryptocurrencies. SUI coin, in particular, has experienced a significant decline of over 10% in the past 24 hours, with its price falling below $0.70. The asset’s technical analysis suggests a bearish trend, characterized by high selling pressure and struggles for buyers to reverse the downward momentum. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Faces Obstacles In Reaching Key Level In June – Here’s Why On the 4-hour timeframe chart, the SUI coin has been in a downtrend, seeking stable support. It trades below its short-term and long-term moving averages, with the 50-day MA at approximately $0.837 and the 200-day MA at $1.020. This positioning below the moving averages signifies a consistent decline in the coin’s price, potentially indicating a lack of buying pressure and weakened market sentiment. The immediate support level for the SUI coin is at $0.50, while the resistance level stands at around $0.76. Recent rejection below the resistance level has fueled the downtrend. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour timeframe chart confirms the bearish sentiment, with an RSI of 17.9 indicating oversold conditions. Sellers currently outnumber buyers, further adding to the downward pressure on the SUI coin. Partnership With Red Bull Racing: Can This Be A Catalyst For SUI Token’s Revival The recent multiyear partnership between Sui and Formula One’s Oracle Red Bull Racing team has the potential to rejuvenate the Sui token price. As Sui becomes the blockchain partner of a renowned and globally recognized racing team, it gains exposure and credibility within the crypto and motorsport communities. This association can drive increased demand for Sui tokens, heightening the token’s value. The collaboration aims to deliver engaging digital experiences for racing fans, creating a loyal user base and bolstering Sui’s reputation. With Red Bull Racing’s previous involvement in the crypto industry, its partnership with Sui signifies a shared interest in exploring the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Related Reading: Bleak Dogecoin (DOGE) Social Sentiment Raises Questions About Price Reversal While the partnership’s success and its impact on the Sui token price depend on several factors, including market conditions and investor sentiment, this collaboration holds promising prospects for the revival of the Sui token. Monitoring future developments and market reactions will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the partnership in driving the Sui token’s resurgence.

42393350,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhTALh,1686399597,Binance Nigeria Ordered to Halt 'Illegal' Operations by Securities Watchdog,"CORRECTION (June 12, 08:07 UTC): Updates headline following Binance's comment that the Nigerian company is not affiliated with the company. An earlier version referred to Binance's Nigerian unit.  A company called Binance Nigeria Limited was ordered to immediately halt operations in the West African nation by the local Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to a Friday circular.  ""Binance Nigeria Limited is neither registered nor regulated by the Commission and its operations in Nigeria are therefore illegal,"" the notice said.  The order follows last week's lawsuit by the U.S. securities watchdog against Binance, the largest global crypto exchange by volume traded. That suit alleges Binance failed to register as a broker or exchange, and that it sold unregistered securities the general public.  A Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk it was aware of the circular, and that Binance Nigeria Limited ""is not affiliated"" with the company. ""We are therefore seeking clarity from the Nigerian SEC and remain committed to working with them cooperatively on the next steps,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.  Although Nigeria's SEC had previously said it viewed all crypto assets to be securities by default, this appears to be the first action taken by the regulator against a platform. In May, Bloomberg reported the SEC was processing crypto firms' applications for registration on a trial basis, but would not officially start registering them until it has reached an agreement with the country's central bank.  Banks in the country are prohibited from offering services to crypto platforms.  ""The Commission shall provide updates on further regulatory actions with respect to the activities of Binance Nigeria Limited, and other similar platforms and shall work with other regulators in Nigeria to provide further guidance on this matter,"" Friday's order said.

On Friday, Singapore-based crypto exchange Crypto.com announced that it would suspend its institutional exchange service for US customers. In a statement provided to media publication Blockworks, the exchange explained that demand is drying up due to the current market conditions in the US. Although it did not specifically reference the lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, it was undoubtedly the overriding factor in the exchange’s decision. In a statement, Crypto.com said: We recently made a business decision to suspend the institutional offering of the Crypto.com Exchange in the U.S. as of 11:59 pm EDT June 21, 2023, due to “limited demand” from institutions in the U.S. in the “current market landscape.” Impacted institutional users were given advance notice to support a smooth transition. The exchange explained that the closure of the US services would not affect its retail trading app, including its crypto derivative product, UpDown Options, regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The company further said it could reopen the platform in the future but did not provide more details. Crypto.com Receives Major Payment Institution Licence in Singapore The exchange started the month out well after receiving a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license for Digital Payment Token (DPT) services from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Securing this license means the exchange can offer DPT services to Singaporean customers. Crypto.com Arena Not Affected After the exchange announced shuttering its institutional services for US customers, speculation arose that it might affect the naming rights for Crypto.com Arena. The exchange entered into a naming rights agreement with AEG, the owner and operator of the arena formerly known as the Staples Center, in 2021, Forbes reports.

13678550,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537321,1686388443,Bleak Dogecoin (DOGE) Social Sentiment Raises Questions About Price Reversal,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently found itself at the center of a storm caused by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against major exchanges Binance and Coinbase. As media outlets spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt regarding the legal proceedings, the market capitalization of this meme coin has experienced a significant drop. However, despite the turbulence, on-chain data reveals that the long-term loyalists of the Dogecoin community remain resolute in their support. In the face of the dwindling media mentions and the calming of the storm, a compelling question arises: could this be the opportune moment for bullish investors to seize the dip and spur yet another impressive price rebound for DOGE? Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Faces Obstacles In Reaching Key Level In June – Here’s Why Dogecoin (DOGE) Holders Show Resilience Amidst Market Turbulence According to detailed on-chain analysis, it appears that the recent sell-offs and price drops in DOGE were primarily driven by short-term traders rather than committed long-term holders. A comprehensive Santiment chart illustrates this phenomenon, showcasing a notable increase in Mean Coin Age within the Dogecoin ecosystem during the same period when massive sell-offs occurred. DOGE Mean Coin Age. Source: Santiment Examining the data between June 1 and June 9, the Mean Coin Age for DOGE has experienced a 5% increase, rising from 54,317 to 57,219. This upward trend in Mean Coin Age during a period of price retracement serves as a promising signal, indicating growing confidence among long-term DOGE holders. Remarkably, approximately 70% of the total circulating Dogecoin supply is currently held by steadfast long-term investors who have held their positions for more than a year. With such a significant portion of DOGE in the hands of committed holders, it follows logically that if they continue to hold onto their coins, the price of DOGE is likely to rebound in the near future. DOGE Social Volume Down: Potential Opportunity For Bullish Investors? Over a span of just four days, from June 5 to June 9, the Social Volume of DOGE has witnessed a staggering decline of 72%, plummeting from 8,219 mentions to 2,308. Santiment’s Social Volume metric serves as a reliable indicator of market sentiment by tracking the frequency of a project’s mentions across various channels, including Twitter and relevant crypto-media platforms. DOGE Social Volume. Source: Santiment When Social Volume experiences a substantial decrease like the one observed above, it signifies that many stakeholders are currently overlooking the asset. This situation presents an opportunity for strategic investors seeking to capitalize on market bottoms. It is common for bullish investors to strategically enter the market when sentiment hits a new low, aiming to purchase assets at their lowest possible value. $doge is like 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 today , a little promising and defying the gravity pic.twitter.com/zHNj0BvHcU — THOMAS (@thomasnegeri) June 9, 2023 Interpreting this drop in Social Volume as a potential turning point for the DOGE price dip, optimistic investors may consider this as an encouraging signal. If this bullish outlook materializes, the crypto community believes that DOGE will regain its upward momentum and ascend the charts once again in the days to come. Source: Coingecko As of now, CoinGecko reports the current price of DOGE at $0.060480, down 11.3% in the past 24 hours.

However, the downward trajectory of prices observed across the cryptocurrency market did not provide a reassuring signal for a potential reversal in the near future. As panic and uncertainty gripped the crypto space, holders of Cardano and other altcoins found themselves questioning the stability and future prospects of these digital assets. What factors contributed to this market-wide decline, and what lies ahead for Cardano amidst this turbulent period? Related Reading: Bearish BNB Signs Hint Downtrend May Persist Beyond Expectations Bearish Trend Emerges As Cardano (ADA) Price Plummets A recent report shed light on the alarming bearish scenario for Cardano (ADA) on its price charts. Currently valued at $0.248073 according to CoinGecko, ADA has suffered a significant decline of 22.2% within the past 24 hours, further exacerbating the downward trend. Over the span of the last seven days, the cryptocurrency has experienced a staggering downturn, plummeting by 34.2%. Source: Coingecko A recent report emphasized the bearish landscape depicted by Cardano (ADA) on its charts, specifically noting its current price, and the breach below the $0.348 mark. This development set the stage for bears to take control of the market across higher timeframes. The report highlighted the significance of this downward movement, as it not only signaled a shift in momentum but also posed challenges for Cardano’s price recovery. Related Reading: ApeCoin Holders Suffer Financial Pain As 95% Endure Negative Returns With the breach of the crucial support level, bears gained the upper hand in dictating market dynamics, particularly on longer timeframes. This bearish sentiment cast a shadow over Cardano’s performance, making it increasingly difficult for the ADA token to regain lost ground and establish upward momentum. The report’s analysis underscored the implications of bears dominating the market, emphasizing the obstacles Cardano might face in its price trajectory. In an attempt to alter the prevailing trend, the bulls made a late May push and managed to establish a high at $0.386. However, their efforts to sustain this shift in market sentiment were futile as they failed to capitalize on this change in character. The failure to maintain the bullish momentum has left Cardano investors and market participants on edge, grappling with concerns about the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory. Cardano (ADA) market cap currently at $8.5 billion. Chart: TradingView.com SEC’s Security Label And Lawsuits Intensify Market Jitters Adding to the already gloomy market sentiment, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dealt a significant blow to Cardano by classifying ADA as a security.

The U.S. District Court of Wyoming, however, did reject Custodia's request that the Fed be compelled to grant it a so-called master account and membership with the Fed. Instead, Custodia must continue its claims via normal channels.  ""Custodia Bank will get its day in court,"" Patrick Toomey, retired U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, tweeted about the decision on Friday afternoon. Toomey, along with the state of Wyoming, filed amicus briefs to support Custodia's suit.  Even though the court declined to grant Wyoming-based Custodia's request, it said that it was only rejecting the request because there was another avenue Custodia could pursue,  ""Custodia has stated a plausible claim for relief ... against FRBKC [Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas]. However, relief under the Mandamus Act is not available to Custodia against the Board of Directors because the APA (Administrative Procedure Act) provides an adequate remedy,"" the ruling said.  The district court also said that if the Kansas City Fed had been alone in denying Custodia its master license, Custodia's claim would fail. However, the court said Custodia's claim that the Fed Board of Governors had weighed in on the decision was plausible.  ""The alleged occurrence of certain events, and the timing of those events, plausibly suggest the Board of Governors had at least some hand in controlling the outcome of Custodia's master account application,"" the court wrote in its ruling.

Without such an account, banks can't offer the same services as institutions with such accounts. Then in August the next year, Custodia applied to the Fed Board of Governors for membership, which would subject the bank to the Fed's oversight and regulations.  Eighteen months later, in January 2023, Custodia was rejected in every single category the Fed assesses, partly because of its crypto friendliness and part because it was a state-chartered bank, not a nationally chartered one.  In its rejection, the central bank claimed Custodia's lack of federal deposit insurance and Custodia’s dependence on a vibrant crypto market made it a danger to itself and its customers.

BNB offers an interesting short-term trade with potential to reach new all-time highs, despite the SEC lawsuit risk. MATIC has performed well and shows a strong risk/reward ratio, with a potential breakout coming. Produced by Jason Appel, with Avi Gilburt and Ryan Wilday From June of 2022, we published a trio of articles (3 Alts With Setups For Higher Highs In the Next Bull Cycle in Crypto) providing detailed thoughts on Binance Coin (BNB-USD), Polygon (MATIC-USD), and Aave (AAVE-USD). This article will review the calls from the past year and provide detailed thoughts on prospective bullish paths for BNB and MATIC. In the case of AAVE, while the setup discussed in its August 2022 update has not invalidated, its progress since then does not inspire confidence for the bullish prospect that was presented and a lower low down to the $22-$25 region cannot be ruled out. First, it’s wise to take a look at Bitcoin (BTC-USD). In the Elliott Wave analysis, we endeavor to consider each chart on its own and while a broad array of Cryptos are developing relative independence from the price movements in Bitcoin, this has not yet proven to be a durable feature of this nascent class of assets. As such, we’d be remiss not to review where the price of Bitcoin is in context for larger expectations. From my recent Bitcoin update from late March of this year: “With all that's transpired, though I can't rule out a lower low [beneath the 2022 low] (which will be discussed), the primary interpretation of this action from November is an initiation move of sorts [to new all-time highs].” To clarify: the action from the 2022 low has not yet confirmed resolutely a completion of the bear market. Price still has $32k-$48k resistance to contend with, but the pattern off the lows offers reasonable indication to be tentatively in favor of a completion to the bear market. BNB In the past few weeks there have been numerous headlines which would appear to be bearish for crypto. The SEC has filed lawsuits against both Coinbase ( COIN ) and Binance, two of the world’s largest Cryptocurrency Exchanges. And while there’s been an uptick in volatility and a downturn in both Coinbase shares prices and BNB price, both have come in to their larger support regions and the crypto market as a whole has not really blinked From the BNB article: “The breakout in February of 2021 marked the start of what's typically found to be the strongest most directional portion of a trend, known as “the heart of the third wave.” In this case, Minor 3 of Intermediate (3) of Primary (circle) 3. Since the May 2021 high, price has pulled back substantially in percentage terms, but note on the chart, the high consolidation, ie, BNB has retraced a very small portion of the wave 3 advance and price is range-bound near the upper end of the whole wave 3.” Given the protracted sideways action, I have slightly shifted perspective to considering a higher degree (3) having completed. However, this does not change expectations for a very bullish outcome over a multi-year time horizon as BNB continues to maintain well above necessary Fibonacci support. Unlike Bitcoin, BNB does not display a pattern that offers confidence to consider a lasting bottom in place, but the current action does present a very favorable short term trading setup with an outside prospect of it turning into a much higher yielding swing trade. The primary perspective currently, shown in black, is that price is still within a corrective pattern and in this interpretation larger degree support ranges down to $100-$120. While this displayed path does not clearly present a very bullish buy and hold outlook for the next several months, there are some individual discrete trading opportunities that have arisen on the smaller time frame. Regarding BNB, price is within support for a favorable long entry. Micro support is in the $245-$277 region and as of writing this, price is hovering in the middle of that zone at $264 and looks to be setting up for another drop down to $250~. The upside target for wave ((III)) in this pattern is $400-$460, followed by a corrective retrace in the wave (iv) and then one more high to complete the B wave, targeting $480-$575. So long as price keeps from making a meaningful break below $240, the short term expectations remain for a bullish resolution from this current pullback. From the ultimate $480-$575 region, given the corrective formation up from the 2022 lows, expectations are for another leg down to complete the wave (4). That said, my secondary alternative path shows the prospect that price makes its way up to the larger degree target region but in an ending diagonal pattern. In either case, given the short term setup, BNB offers an interesting trade from a risk/reward perspective that has the opportunity to run to new all-time highs. The technical setup aside, please be mindful of the heightened risk based on the SEC lawsuit. For those concerned about the longer-term expected path: The expectation is that price can drop from the B wave target ($480-$575) down to the $100-$120 region to complete a very elongated wave (4) and then head up to new all-time highs. Note, my adjusted target region for the wave (5) - whether price heads there in more direct fashion as per the blue count or in more circuitous fashion as per the black count - is $1750 all the way up to a whopping $7500 with an ideal target between $2100-$3700. Jason Appel (Crypto Waves) MATIC Of the three altcoins written about here last summer, MATIC has fared the best by a long shot. Even with MATIC’s large pullback from the February 2023 high, it is still up over 70% since we presented it here on July 6th of 2022. And at the February peak, price was up about 200% from the price at publication. Unlike BNB which has moved up in a corrective pattern from the 2022 low, MATIC has managed to rally in a 5 wave formation from into the February 2023 high. This is very suggestive of a completed wave (4) and price starting the wave (5) up to new all-time highs. We note in Elliott Wave analysis that an initial 5 wave pattern in the direction of a larger trend that occurs at the completion of a corrective, countertrend, 3 wave pattern signals an initiation move for the next cycle in the trend, in this case bullish. Though MATIC’s rally from the 2022 low into the February 2023 is somewhat irregular. The overall pattern is “textbook” from an Elliott Wave perspective and portends a big breakout coming. The lower end of this target region, $4.19, represents the prospect of a weak wave (5). However, supposing this (5) finds support in the standard region $0.54-$0.85 and then continues upward in impulsive fashion, we will keep our attention on the $6.40 to $13 region. Clearly, $13 offers a much bigger gain than $4.19, but as price rises into the target region, the risk/reward ratio begins to deteriorate and we encourage good risk management practices among all our members at Crypto Waves. Even considering the lower end of the target region, a long entry in support offers a well-defined setup with a strong risk/reward ratio On the micro level price has enough waves to consider the downside pullback to be completing but a rally over $0.97 will be needed to suggest with some confidence that a low in wave 2 has been struck. In order for the thesis of this trade to remain within reason, price should get no sustained break beneath $0.40. While technical invalidation of the thesis does not occur until a prospective break below $0.31 develops, below $0.40 on a sustained basis would jeopardize the upside potential that’s shown within this setup. Even with a large percent risk to the downside from current support, the overall risk/reward skew with a great technical setup is favorable in the current region.

13667574,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=537308,1686355232,"Bitcoin (BTC) Lower Timeframe Outlook: $26,800 Breakthrough Could Spark Rally","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, made a fake attempt to breach the $27,500 barrier on Tuesday. Since then, it has been trading sideways, moving within a narrow channel. The 50-day Moving Average, which is the nearest resistance, is at $27,200. Meanwhile, the strongest support is at the 200-day MA, placed at $25,200. For Bitcoin to initiate a fully formed bull run in the market, it is essential to hold this support level, if BTC bulls expect another attempt to breach the $30,000 mark and propel the market in full force, the $25,200 support level is crucial, and it needs to be held to achieve this goal. Related Reading: Here’s How Current Bitcoin Capitulation Compares With Past Crashes XRP And LTC Poised For Breakouts As Bitcoin Eyes $28,000 The lower timeframe picture for Bitcoin is straightforward, according to cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe. He believes that for BTC to continue its upward trend, it needs to break through the $26,800 level. If that level is breached and flipped, Van de Poppe predicts that $27,500 is a likely next target, with the possibility of further breakouts on XRP and Litecoin (LTC). Van de Poppe’s analysis is based on technical indicators and market trends. He highlights the significance of the $26,800 level as a key resistance level that must be overcome for BTC to gain momentum. The cryptocurrency has been trading in a narrow range, and a breakout could signal a shift in market sentiment. Van de Poppe’s predictions align with the overall bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with many analysts expecting BTC to continue its upward trajectory. However, there are also concerns about potential price corrections and volatility, which could impact short-term market movements. BTC In Period of Stability, Revisiting 200-Week MA Despite Downside Volatility According to cryptocurrency analyst Rekt Capital, BTC is currently in a period of stability. If this stability continues, BTC could revisit the $27,600 level and potentially break out. However, BTC is still retesting the 200-week Moving Average despite downside volatility below it during the week. Furthermore, BTC is currently trading below a series of Lower Highs, which is represented by the blue line in the chart. To move higher, BTC needs to invalidate this series of Lower Highs. On the other hand, the 200-week MA is acting as support, as indicated by the orange line in the chart. Together, these factors are creating a pennant-like structure, which is a pattern that typically indicates price compression and is often followed by a period of volatility. Rekt Capital’s analysis suggests that BTC is at a critical juncture, with the potential for a breakout or a breakdown depending on how it interacts with the 200-week MA and the series of Lower Highs.
