42405293,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLwWz,1603745103,Why Wyoming's Governor Supports the State's Crypto Banking Law,"It took two years of infrastructure building but on Sept. 16 the Wyoming Division of Banking finally landed a prominent pioneer.      That’s when Kraken Financial became the first entity to receive a special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter in the Cowboy State, giving the cryptocurrency industry insight into roughly how long it takes to become a bank. It’s also the first newly chartered (de novo) bank the state has approved since 2006.      While Kraken Financial still has some hoops to jump through before it has a certificate of authority to operate, Wyoming is running to keep its lead in the digital asset space. And it’s a priority shared by the state’s top elected official, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon.      The biggest challenge going forward for the state’s lead in the blockchain space will be seeing how the federal government responds to the regulatory scheme the state is creating, Gordon told CoinDesk.      Wyoming’s SPDI charter could still be affected by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) future decisions on national banks safeguarding crypto, and by other decisions Congress makes in response to large projects like Facebook’s Libra.      “We don’t want to wait until an MIT or a Facebook does something,” Gordon told CoinDesk in an interview. “We really have the opportunity here.”      “I’m really thankful that Kraken looked past Los Angeles and really understood that a small state, business-friendly, great tax environment, that was the place to bring new innovation,” Gordon said.      The state and prominent Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm Promontory Financial are leveraging current Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council manuals such as the Bank Secrecy Act. That includes guidance for bank examiners on how to question banks that handle digital assets.      Read more: Kraken Becomes First Crypto Exchange to Charter a US Bank      “While we knew early on that we had supervisory manuals available from federal agencies and our in-house procedures, no one had really blended the two together,” said Wyoming Banking Commissioner Albert Forkner. “It could push a 500-page document.”      After the first round of exams, the manual will be revised to ensure consumer protections without stifling innovation, Forkner added.    Wyoming’s approach    Forkner said the Wyoming Division of Banking will work to ensure state law is not too dissimilar from what the federal government does in the future so that Wyoming doesn’t cause confusion for banks.      The level of exposure the SPDI charter is giving Wyoming is significant, Forkner said. The state has no foreign bank presence and not many branches from other state banks. Of the roughly 30 state-chartered banks in Wyoming, most of them are holding under $1 billion in assets.      “If you think about traditional banks, unless you’re a niche bank they all have similar activities,” Forkner said. “These companies have different markets and targets.”      Among traditional bankers, there’s not a lot of attention to the SPDI charter because it’s a special purpose institution, said Silvergate CEO Alan Lane. (Kraken has been a longtime customer of Silvergate.)      Read more: What It Takes to Get a Crypto-Friendly Bank Charter in Wyoming      “It doesn’t get a lot of headlines because there’s no FDIC insurance behind it,” Forkner said of SPDIs. “Everyone who is interested in digital assets recognizes Kraken’s name, and Kraken has various licenses around the world.”      Having more banking options in the space will mean crypto investors and firms won’t have to worry about being de-risked in the future, Lane said.      “Access to the Federal Reserve wire system is one of the differentiators for banks and one of the reasons that fintechs and cryptocurrency exchanges need banking partners,” Lane said. “Most players in this ecosystem, especially if you’ve been in it for a while, they want to have diversity, they want to have redundancy in their banking partnerships.”    Limited reach    SPDIs won’t compete on every level with Silvergate because of their inability to lend, Lane added. While the crypto industry will have fully reserved banks to turn to, Kraken and new entrants like Avanti won’t be able to offer products like SEN Leverage, a bitcoin-backed lending program that Silvergate just finished piloting.      As SPDIs wait for the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City to determine if it will provide the newly chartered banks with Fed master accounts, Silvergate is willing to work with the de novo banks on payments.      “A year or so ago we started a correspondent banking effort to work with other banks that are providing cryptocurrency-related banking services in other countries,” Lane said. “It’s certainly possible that we could help them get started.    Broader aims    Wyoming’s SPDI charter could play a role in new financial innovation in the state at a time when the state has been economically depressed.      Gordon said he believes digital assets could play a role in financing environmental sustainability efforts. For instance, blockchain could offer a better venue for trading carbon credits, which are tokens that give companies the right to emit a certain amount of carbon.      “One of the challenges we saw on the West Coast this year is that energy markets started to break down a little bit as people got very possessive,” Gordon said. “There’s opportunity for [blockchain] innovation in a renewable world where you can start to sell energy and get energy back.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/26/why-wyomings-governor-supports-the-states-crypto-banking-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc776e4cc7a885519813bca95bbce4270249e389-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $13,011 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.33% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $12,773-$13,250  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price was riding high Monday, going up to $13,250 on spot exchanges like Bitstamp before dropping as low as $12,773 around 17:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET).      John Willock, CEO of crypto liquidity provider Tritum, said the bitcoin market can stay near its current price point, although some traders participated in profit-taking Monday.      “I think that it is possible to keep around $13,000 for the short term,” said Willock. “There will likely be some traders looking to close out longs from the recent run-up that might cause a minor retrenchment,” he added.      However, Consantin Kogan, a partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital, said bitcoin had positive momentum going for it before its abrupt drop in price, and that more is to come. “We must take into account that a correction is already brewing,” he said.“I think it will happen this week.”      Major global stock indices are also down Monday amid COVID-19 uncertainty.    The Nikkei 225 in Asia closed flat, in the red 0.09% as fears of tighter coronavirus restrictions globally left investors uncertain.  The FTSE 100 ended the day slipping 1.6% as growing coronavirus cases in Europe led investors to hit the sell button.  In the United States the S&P 500 fell 2.2% as coronavirus infection counts increase and a possible government stimulus package is in limbo.    “When macro issues happen, it affects the entire market and not just one asset class,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at quant trading firm Efficient Frontier. “Hopes for stimulus are dimming while coronavirus cases are ticking upwards in America and around the world. This is causing countries to shut down things again, which will cause the economy to contract further.”      Read More: Marathon Purchases Additional 10,000 S-19 Pro Miners From Bitmain      While bitcoin has dipped when equities slump of late, the bellwether of cryptocurrency has performed much, much better than stocks over the balance of 2020.

Indeed, funding rates on futures are still mostly positive on futures exchanges, which means long-oriented traders continue to pay for leverage liquidity to make bullish bets.    Ether fees keep dropping    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Monday trading around $391 and slipping 4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

42405301,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLwct,1603737270,From DeFi to DeOps: How Public Blockchains Could Supplement ERP Systems,"Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is simultaneously one of the most transformational technologies for modern business and also one of the most boring. Quite simply, ERP is the glue that holds modern enterprises together, connecting business processes across large enterprises in a standardized way.      That said, there is also nothing magical about ERP. It simply combines two things: transactional data (purchases, sales and inventory levels) with business rules and process. The results are simple, but the technology itself has immensely powerful capabilities, for instance, automatically re-ordering supplies when an inventory runs low, without human intervention. With blockchain technology, we are entering the era of decentralized, ERP-like apps that can span multiple enterprises but also share data and logic, in turn automating and digitizing commerce.    Paul Brody is EY's global innovation leader for blockchain. The views in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the global EY organization or its member firms.    In an always-on digital environment, this doesn’t seem very new or unusual. That’s because when it comes to truly digital supply chains, most companies are faking it, not making it.      The secret truth about digital commerce is that it usually comes to a screeching halt at the enterprise door. It’s not uncommon for a digital system to create a purchase order using PDF software (which is emailed to a supplier), only for it to be scanned into their systems using a process called optical character recognition (OCR).      This digital-analog-digital scanning process is only one step above printing and faxing. Within the digital supply chain, electronic data interchange (EDI) is one step above OCR, but it only allows for static communication (and only between two parties). Furthermore, it doesn’t support any kind of shared business logic or process.      To understand what a big deal this is – and to get a sense of how much is at stake – it is useful to step back and define how big the impact of ERP has been. When I joined McKinsey & Co, in 1995, process change was something you put on paper and into manuals. With the widespread deployment of ERP, the reality is that business processes – if they exist – really only exist in software.      See also: Paul Brody - ‘Great Artists Steal’ – What Enterprise Blockchain Can Learn From the Past      If you want to put a product on sale at 500 stores across the country (or around the world), it can likely only be achieved with end-to-end software. Whether forecasting the sale events or planning increased inventory and making sure price reductions happen at the cash register, if it doesn’t happen with enterprise software it probably won’t happen at all.      Thanks to ERP, the efficiencies driven by a single retailer alone are thought to have cut the cost of living in the U.S. for the average person by $895 a year.      ERP systems have such a huge impact because they allow companies to make good on their operating scale. Companies that are integrated from end to end can also negotiate significantly lower prices with suppliers. Their promise to buy only from a preferred supplier is much more credible because ERP systems will simply block purchases from unauthorized suppliers – something that used to happen routinely before digital systems were introduced. ERPs can also carry less inventory and have lower shipping costs as they track inventory levels and plan replenishment operations each day.    Instead of suppliers having to integrate with customized systems in large enterprises, they can instead interact with standardized apps and tokens on the public blockchain network.    Exciting? No. High impact? Yes.      The benefits associated with these systems have traditionally been limited to the largest companies because each large enterprise has its own digital hub for collaboration. If you’re a supplier and you want to sell to a big retailer, be prepared to join the supplier's network (which is not free). Each integration brings with it both efficiency and long-term cost commitments. For instance, smaller companies are often overwhelmed by these types of demands – but ERP can remove that hurdle.      Blockchain technology has the potential to change the dynamics of system integrations. Instead of suppliers having to integrate with customized systems in large enterprises, they can instead interact with standardized apps and tokens on the public blockchain network.      DeOps (Decentralized Operations) applications could take hold. Want to have automated replenishment of your inventory? There’s a DeOps app for that. Insuring a shipment between two locations? There’s a DeOps app for that. Managing warehouse space that you rent from a third party? Same again.      See also: Paul Brody - Enterprises Need Third Parties for Oracles to Work      DeOps applications will take the two main components of ERP – shared facts and shared business logic – and enable them to operate between enterprises and across enterprise boundaries. This will allow for truly digital end-to-end supply chains without having to worry about centralized entities spying on and monetizing the data flowing between companies.      How much might the shift to truly digital supply chains be worth? Trillions of dollars. Given that nearly everything we buy today passes through multiple hands before it arrives in your home, there is a good chance that increased efficiency is possible at every step of the process.      Entire industries have been built – and companies transformed – on their implementation of ERP. The impact of decentralized operations is likely to be just as large. And while nearly every large company currently has some form of an ERP system, almost none of them use DeOps applications – so we are just at the beginning of this transformation.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/26/from-defi-to-deops-how-public-blockchains-could-supplement-erp-systems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae878e4c872aeb4e34f58e93a5d516955fc2cf69-2250x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385005,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmWM1,1603737081,PayPal’s Crypto Offering May Be ‘a Huge Headache’ for Taxpayers,"PayPal’s decision last week to embrace crypto may help with mainstream adoption, but it could also mean additional tax work for users unfamiliar with the crypto landscape.      Over the next few weeks PayPal will be rolling out buy, sell and hold features for cryptocurrencies on its platform to U.S. users, but the service will not allow users to withdraw or deposit holdings.      According to Internal Revenue Service rules, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) are treated like property; therefore, each time someone buys, sells or exchanges a digital asset it is considered a taxable event wherein the capital gains tax applies.      Under PayPal’s plans to make cryptocurrencies a “funding source” for purchases at its 26 million merchant customers, this will also apply to situations such as paying for a cup of coffee using BTC via PayPal, where the transaction could incur a capital gain or loss of a few cents. Because PayPal said transactions with merchants would be settled in fiat, each time the platform converts a user’s crypto to cash a tax obligation is created.      Read more: Crypto Long & Short: Why the PayPal Rally Isn’t What It Seems, and Why That’s OK      “The accounting on this would be a huge headache,” said Stephen Turanchik, a tax attorney at law firm Paul Hastings and member of the AICPA’s virtual currency task force. He pointed out that regardless of crypto being involved, PayPal and Venmo can add a lot of accounting work because of the variety of transactions that occur on these platforms.      Adding crypto to the mix could make it more challenging to capture all the transactions and associated capital gains or losses, especially if users mix business and personal payments on these platforms.      According to Kirk Phillips, a certified public accountant (CPA), while PayPal may help springboard crypto adoption, the tax ripple effects are also likely to depend on how good a job it does on reporting. As a payment processor, PayPal is required to issue Form 1099-Ks to users and the IRS if an account holder's total proceeds go over $20,000 and includes more than 200 transactions in a calendar year.      Regardless of whether they meet that requirement, all users will also be able to see their transaction history and account statements through their PayPal account.      While the forms and transaction history can be helpful, these documents may not be sufficient for tax purposes because users will also need to keep track of the base price they bought the digital asset for, how much they spent on it, how long it was held before being sold and the price for which it was sold.      Venmo, which is heavily used for small purchases, could complicate this trail a little more.      “We're gonna see more and more micro purchases, and the importance of some sort of de minimis (too minor to merit consideration) exception might become greater,” said Lisa Zarlenga, co-chair of the tax group at law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP.      Read more: PayPal’s Move Is Good for Crypto Adoption but Not So Much for Profits: Morgan Stanley      She pointed out these transactions are currently treated as capital gains or losses, no matter how small, and therefore are taxable events.      A best practice for users might just be to focus on keeping well-maintained records of their crypto interactions, she said.      Although PayPal’s embrace of crypto promises to bring digital assets to a mainstream base of users, the demanding tax rules may also lead to early stumbles from some of them. For now, a simple practice to start with may be to avoid using emoticons in the memo line for Venmo or PayPal transfers.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/26/paypals-crypto-offering-may-be-a-huge-headache-for-taxpayers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2141c1dd5b93c74383fdc330cd3dd3fbd0fbda80-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385004,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmWOX,1603736309,US Bail Funds Are Seeing an Uptick in Cryptocurrency Donations,"For many people arrested, especially low-income citizens, bail funds are their best hope for freedom while they await trial. Now, some of those funds are accepting cryptocurrency donations.      Facilitated by crypto payment processor The Giving Block, the Bail Project, the Chicago Community Bond Fund and the Nashville Community Bail Fund, for example, accept cryptocurrency including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and even basic attention token (BAT). They’ve taken in thousands of dollars in crypto donations since the summer, according to The Giving Block, which could be a sign of larger adoption in the space of bail funds.      This summer saw a rise in civil action against police violence in the U.S., with thousands of protestors taking to the streets over the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.      Numerous protestors were arrested. Around this time, Alex Wilson, co-founder of The Giving Block, started hearing from bail funds that were interested in using The Giving Block to process cryptocurrency payments.      Read more: Baby Steps or Handcuffs? Crypto Pros Assess PayPal’s Bitcoin Play      According to the director of the Community Justice Exchange, Pilar Weiss, not many of the organization's member bail funds accept crypto. She said that is based on the grassroots nature of many crowdfunding actions for bail funds. While a handful of their member funds accept crypto, including the Richmond Bail Fund, if they do it’s usually because they have some back-end administrative capacity to accept.      Weiss said she could see that change, however, as fundraising platforms like PayPal, for example, move into accepting cryptocurrency donations.      “The traditional kind of nonprofit donor, which some nonprofits rely on, are on the older side, in their fifties and sixties, and often even retired,” said Wilson. “Sometimes [nonprofits] have a hard time connecting with younger donors. So they see this as one of those ways of doing that. It also helps them look a little bit more innovative when they're starting to play with stuff like crypto and not just taking checks in the mail.”    Bail and bail funds    When someone is arrested, a judge sets bail and the detainee must either pay that amount or stay in jail until the trial. But not everyone has access to ready cash and the system disproportionately impacts low-income citizens in both the short and long term.      According to research from the Bail Project, a single night in prison can have cascading effects such as the loss of a job, a home and even custody of children.      Waiting in jail prior to trial also impacts a detainee’s likelihood of going to prison, according to a regularly updated report on cash bail from the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute.      The report found that “those who are held pretrial are four times more likely to be sentenced to prison than defendants released prior to trial. Pretrial detainees are also likely to make hurried decisions to plead guilty to a lower charge to spend less time behind bars rather than changing a higher charge and longer sentence at trial.”      See also: Belarus News Media Are Testing Decentralized Tech to Resist Censorship      Bail funds are essentially large, crowdsourced funds that are then used to bail people out of jail as they await their trials. Organizations like the Bail Project, the Chicago Community Bond Fund and the Nashville Community Bail Fund are working to pay bail for those who can’t afford it in such situations.      Co-director of the Nashville Community Community Bail Fund Jessica Lamb says the fund was founded in 2016 to free low-income Nashvillians from jail, and work to end what the fund calls ""wealth-based detention.""      “Our vision is a society where money does not determine any person's access to freedom,” said Lamb in an email. “Since our inception, we have freed nearly 1,500 Nashvillians from jail. We also work with community partners to disrupt the criminal legal system and work toward money bail policy reform.”    Bail funds, civil rights and the 2020 US election    Bail has a cascading effect on things from civil rights to elections. If people know they’re unlikely to be able to risk arrest because they can’t afford bail, they will be less inclined to take to the streets against injustice. That threat of arrest and staying in jail is a coercive measure that, in effect, curbs protestors' right to free speech and assembly.      Bail also has downstream consequences for elections. Given that being unable to afford bail affects whether they will plead guilty as well as how long they’re held, it can curb people’s ability to vote. Besides being unable to vote, If someone is held in detention and pleads guilty to something on the level of a felony, that voting ability can be curtailed for years.    Why crypto matters    Wilson said there are a number of benefits for bail funds taking cryptocurrency donations.      One is it helps them offset economic loss, given the economic uncertainty of the times, by diversifying their revenue and donation streams. Another aspect he has noticed in his work is that cryptocurrencies tend to appeal to a younger demographic, and they’re likely to be completely new donors.      See also: Monero-for-Bail Project Sees Increased Demand During Protests      The important ability of international donors to contribute easily through crypto is specifically something Wilson was hearing from groups that were part of The Giving Block’s Crypto for Black Lives campaign, which was kicked off this summer to raise money for civil rights organizations, including bail funds. While that wasn’t the reason The Giving Block became interested in crypto, it’s become an important component.      The final reason is simple: taxes. When you realize a capital gain (price increase) on a cryptocurrency and trade or cash it out, that’s a taxable event. But bitcoin or other cryptocurrency donations to a nonprofit are treated like donations of stock. As such they are not considered taxable events, meaning you don’t pay those capital gains taxes when you donate and you can deduct them on your tax return.      Read more: ‘Snake Oil and Overpriced Junk’: Why Blockchain Doesn’t Fix Online Voting      The Bail Project’s Chief Financial Officer Zach Herz-Roiphe said he’d encourage any nonprofit to cast as wide a net as possible for donors. Thus far, bitcoin specifically and crypto in general have historically made up an extremely small portion of total donations over the years, but as crypto becomes more mainstream he expects that to change.      “We expect that more people will embrace crypto as their preferred method of making donations – especially as people understand the tax benefits of giving via crypto, which are similar to those of donating conventional securities,” he said.    Crypto’s impact on social justice    Practically, The Giving Block is serving as a payment processor and enabler for these organizations to expand how they take donations.      “We essentially try to make it as easy as possible for bail funds or other nonprofits to be able to accept crypto and not have to worry about, for example, the volatility of crypto,” said Wilson. “So all these nonprofits have an option to automatically convert the crypto to U.S. dollars.”      Wilson said that while his organization has seen a tailing off of interest from bail funds after the summer, there is still a greater level of interest than there has been. On a high level, according to Wilson, these projects have gotten thousands of dollars, but less than $25,000 each since June in crypto donations.      See also: Activists Document Police Misconduct Using Decentralized Protocol      Lamb said cryptocurrency donations are a small portion of the Nashville Community Bail Fund’s total donations.      “But it's cool to see donations coming in a new way. One of the best parts about it for us has been learning more about the crypto community, especially the ways it has pitched in to support both the COVID-19 crisis and the movement for Black lives,” said Lamb.      These aren’t the only projects leveraging crypto in the service of supporting efforts for systemic change. Bail Bloc is a project that lets you mine monero (XMR) for bail funds. A few months ago, a group of activists put together a project to document police violence on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and the Ethereum blockchain.      “I think the issue of addressing bail will continue to be popular with the crypto community,” said Wilson. “In general I think the cause of ending cash bail is one that really resonates. In the meantime, helping people afford bail is an alternative.”",POSITIVE,BAT | BTC | ETH,BAT | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/26/us-bail-funds-are-seeing-an-uptick-in-cryptocurrency-donations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52a9672a67120a12e9387530626f8fcf115b1df0-2212x1638.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to reports, an attacker used a flash loan – a technique that allows a trader to take on massive leverage without any downside – to manipulate DeFi prices for profit. The exploit sent the platform’s native token, FARM, tumbling by 65% in less than an hour, followed by the project's total value locked (TVL), which dropped from over $1 billion before the exploit to $430 million as of press time.      The funds were eventually swapped for bitcoin (BTC), but not before being swept through Ethereum mixing service Tornado Cash.      Read more: Harvest Finance Token Plummets 65% After Attack Saps DeFi Site of TVL      Mixing the coins didn’t keep the Harvest Finance team in the dark for long. The person behind the exploit “is well-known in the crypto community” after leaving “a significant amount of personally identifiable information,” according to the project’s Discord. All seven bitcoin wallets holding the attacker’s funds are also known.      The anonymous developers behind the project do not want to doxx the party but are instead offering a $100,000 bounty for convincing the attacker to send back the funds.      “For the attacker: you've proven your point, if you can return the funds to the users, it would be greatly appreciated by the community, including many bystanders,” the team said via Discord.    Flash loans strike again    The exploit itself was executed by a series of arbitrage trades between DeFi protocols Uniswap, Curve Finance and Harvest Finance, according to Etherscan. The attacker began by taking out a $50 million USDC flash loan from Uniswap. Then they began swapping between USDC and tether (USDT) to cause the two tokens’ prices to swing wildly.      The price of USDT began to drop on Harvest Finance as the attacker swapped tokens back and forth. The attacker then swapped discounted USDT for stablecoins taken out in the flash loan. The attacker performed the act multiple times. Each successful swap was then turned into ether (ETH) then tokenized bitcoin (WBTC and renBTC, in that order) and then finally BTC, according to Zerion.

A popular DeFi application appears to have been attacked. JPMorgan analysts see ""considerable"" upsides to bitcoin.    Top shelf    Crypto guidance The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has clarified that simply holding cryptocurrencies does not need to be disclosed. A published set of draft instructions for this year’s 1040 tax form spells out that returnees must disclose any crypto sales, exchanges for goods or services, or exchanges for property (including other crypto assets). Respondents must also reveal if they received any cryptocurrency for free, including via airdrops or hard forks. “The draft is likely to stand unless there are ‘unexpected issues’ or new legislation requiring changes, the IRS said in the document,” CoinDesk’s Daniel Palmer reports.      DeFi drain The $1 billion Harvest Finance protocol appears to have been attacked, draining $25 million worth of bitcoin and stablecoins. The anonymous team behind the popular DeFi application tweeted they are “working actively on the issue of mitigating the economic attack,” adding the malicious actor manipulated stablecoin prices on Curve Finance, another DeFi protocol. DeFi analyst Chris Blec earlier claimed Harvest Finance’s administrators held an “admin key that can drain funds” locked in the protocol’s contracts – though it’s unclear if that level of control is related to the recent exploit. The platform’s native token, FARM, tumbled 65%, and the protocol’s TVL dropped to $673 million (as of 5:00 UTC) on the news.      Tether forfeits The U.S. government is pursuing a civil forfeiture claim on more than 300,000 units of the tether (USDT) cryptocurrency after they were reported stolen in a hack earlier this year, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reports. The funds, co-owned by Shixuan Cai and business partner Lin Jian Chen, were frozen by operator Tether after Cai reported the theft to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in April, court documents show. “Tether routinely assists law enforcement agents and seeks to further their legitimate objectives,” Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino told CoinDesk. “Tether will always play by the rules, obey the law and try to be supportive of the wider digital token community.”      Speech rights The case against Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith, who is charged by the U.S. government with violating sanctions law and executive orders by allegedly discussing how to bypass economic blockades while speaking at a North Korean cryptocurrency conference, stands without merit, the defense claims. In a motion to dismiss, attorney Brian Klein alleges Griffith only provided information that was already in the public domain and that the President of the United States does not have the authority to prohibit the transmission of information, among other claims. Griffith’s arrest last November is the first sanctions case in a U.S. court involving cryptocurrency.      Denial of service PayPal has dropped controversial domain registrar and hosting service Epik as a client, according to Mashable. The payments giant said it had ceased servicing the company over concerns about financial risk, potentially related to Epik’s digital currency, a source “close to the situation"" suggested.

Though a question remains about how the decentralized money may fit itself into the larger investor scheme.      Part of the issue here is the investor universe is a moving target, especially as more millennials enter the fray. Last week, JPMorgan’s Global Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy published a note, obtained by CoinDesk's Zack Voell, detailing how this changing investor landscape could contribute to “considerable” upsides for bitcoin.      Comparing bitcoin to gold, the client memo argued that bitcoin should be seen as a “risk” asset rather than a hedge, based on its positive correlation with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The analysts pointed to millennial investors’ interest in cryptocurrency and the demographic’s increasing role in the larger financial scheme.      CoinDesk’s Voell notes that bitcoin’s market capitalization would have to increase by a factor of 10 before it could match the total private-sector investment in gold. Though “even a modest crowding out of gold as an alternative currency over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from here,” JPMorgan’s note reads.      That said, the analysts suggest bitcoin is “currently overbought for the near term.”    Market intel    Whale parade The number of bitcoin “whales” – clusters of addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – is standing at a four-year high. As of Sunday, there are now 1,939 whales, the highest since Sept. 2016, representing a 2.2% increase since last week. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole notes the increase is likely tied to the prevailing bullish pressures around bitcoin's price, which jumped 13% last week to register its best single-week performance since April.

42385002,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmWKl,1603728018,Notional Launches Out of Stealth to Bring Fixed-Rate Lending to DeFi,"Lending and borrowing rates on all the top decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are dizzyingly variable.      Enter Notional, a new protocol that lets users lend and borrow crypto at fixed rates. After 10 months in stealth, the platform launches in beta on Ethereum today. The startup also announced Monday a $1.3 million funding round from a total of eight investors, including Coinbase Ventures, 1confirmation and Polychain.      Notional enables fixed-rate debt on Ethereum using a new on-chain automated market maker (AMM) that can be used by DeFi, CeFi and institutional traders, the startup said in a statement.      “Today, DeFi is a jungle full of high net-worth speculators, self-identified degenerates and meme chasers,” said co-founder Teddy Woodward. “With Notional, you can take advantage of volatility instead of getting hurt by it.”      To accomplish that, Notional lets DeFi traders lock in borrowing rates on dai (DAI) to finance yield farming activities for up to six months, all while accessing fixed rates on levered long ether (ETH) trades for the same amount of time using a token called fCash.    How fCash works    “It’s a token like any other but it’s got one specialty,” Woodward told CoinDesk in an interview, “which is that upon a certain date, its maturity date, it can be converted or redeemed for one unit, or even have an associated currency.”      For now, fCash represents DAI at a future date in time. By trading between DAI and fDAI, “the rate at which I exchange DAI today for DAI in the future implies an interest rate that is fixed over the period of time until its maturity date,” he added.      Notional seeks to tap into the established demand for fixed-rate loans in traditional markets.      Investor Nick Tomaino, founder of 1confirmation, told CoinDesk in an email, “We’re excited about bringing fixed-rate loans to people in a current Ethereum lending environment where variable-rate loans dominate.”      “Ultimately, we want to move DeFi forward,” Woodward said, adding:    “The ability to lend and borrow at fixed rates is going to open up a brand new dimension, or financial design space, for DeFi and Ethereum’s ecosystem.”",POSITIVE,ETH | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | DAI,Doreen Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/26/notional-launches-out-of-stealth-to-bring-fixed-rate-lending-to-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a7c81d292843ec9383fabcdfe13e9298b317110-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385012,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmWZr,1603727719,The Big Choices When Designing Central Bank Digital Currencies,"The increased interest in central bank digital currency (CBDC) has led to a surge in ideas and research about the topic, so much so that it’s all but impossible to keep up with everything that’s been published lately. All this information brings a welcome diversity of perspectives to the debate, but it also makes it more difficult to focus on the most important aspects of CBDC.      When it comes to designing a CBDC, we need to draw a crucial distinction between direct and indirect CBDCs.    Marcelo M. Prates is a lawyer at the Central Bank of Brazil and holds a doctorate from Duke University School of Law. The views and opinions expressed here are his.    In simple terms, a direct CBDC makes it possible for everybody, from big banks to informal workers, to deposit their money with the central bank. It would be like having a central bank “checking account” for basic payment services: receiving, holding, spending and transferring money.      This direct model tends to raise concerns, though. In times of crisis, people could move their money from banks to the central bank, creating bank runs that would worsen the trouble. Even in normal times, if a significant number of bank deposits moved to the central bank, banks would lose a cheap source of funding and might have trouble providing as much credit as demanded. This situation could, in turn, hamper economic growth.      Other critics say payment services directly offered by the central bank can only be as good as the services provided by a Department of Motor Vehicles – hardly a compliment. These critics add that a direct CBDC would kill payments innovation, as government institutions are not known for boundless creativity.      To avoid displacing banks and stifling innovation, central bankers and scholars have been exploring models of indirect CBDC.      Take, for example, the so-called two-tiered CBDC. In this model, a CBDC is issued to regulated and supervised institutions, which then distribute the CBDC to the public. Don’t we already have that? Most dollars circulating in the economy today are digital and made available through regulated intermediaries: the balances from bank accounts that we use to make payments and transfers.      Consider now the synthetic CBDC, or sCBDC. The idea is that licensed private entities are authorized to issue “digital dollars” fully backed by central bank reserves, a type of central bank money used in transactions between banks and with the central bank. The sCBDC would certainly be a safe and stable type of money, but would it be a CBDC?      The synthetic CBDC looks a lot like e-money (aka prepaid debit cards) or its evil twin, the stablecoin, which is nothing but unregulated e-money. E-money issuers in the European Union, for example, are licensed and supervised institutions that are legally required to safeguard the funds of their clients, so that e-money balances can always be redeemed at their nominal value.      See also: Marcelo M. Prates - 4 Myths About CBDCs Debunked      The similarities are even more striking in Brazil, where e-money issuers can keep users’ funds deposited directly with the central bank. The Brazilian legal framework also requires these funds to be kept segregated from the issuer’s own funds to protect users if the payment provider goes bust.      Indirect CBDCs are, thus, far from a tempting option. Most models of indirect CBDCs are not offering anything new; some should not even be considered CBDCs. It seems that we’re trying to find a recipe for making a monetary omelet without breaking eggs.    Balance sheet question    The question about direct and indirect CBDCs is, in fact, a question about balance sheets. It’s all about defining whether the digital money you own is an entry in the central bank’s balance sheet or whether it appears in the balance sheet of an intermediary.      Balance sheets are for digital money what safes and vaults are for banknotes and coins: a place where you can put your money to keep it safeguarded. Today, only banks and some selected financial institutions can park their spare money in the huge vaults and balance sheet of the central bank. For the rest of us, the typical option is to keep our money in the vaults and balance sheets of commercial banks.      Why does this difference matter? Because the balance sheet of the central bank is the only one that never runs dry. If our digital money is deposited with the central bank, we know that, apart from political unrest or rampant inflation, we’ll always be able to save, spend, or transfer our money with minimal risks.    Let us not dismiss direct CBDCs too quickly. If properly designed, they may well be the most promising option for a CBDC, if not the only one that can bring real change to the monetary system.    Can’t we find a way to preserve the benefits of a direct CBDC while reducing its downside? Yes, we can. A good example is the platform model proposed by the Bank of England earlier this year (not the so-called hybrid model).      In this model you still find intermediaries between the central bank and the public. However, these intermediaries are not offering a balance sheet to hold people’s digital money. They provide instead technological tools to help any person or business connect with the central bank and access the digital money kept there.      In short: the platform model combines indirect connection to the central bank with direct access to the central bank balance sheet and the CBDCs.      This type of CBDC could promote innovation and boost public-private collaboration in the monetary system. The central bank would continue to be responsible for the monetary infrastructure, making the payment system work and setting money accounts for everyone, not just banks. This would also make the distinction between “wholesale” and “retail” CBDC redundant: it would be the same CBDC for all.      More than that, the central bank would have to ensure that this infrastructure is not only safe and resilient but neutral and open. The goal should be to allow different types of software that meet performance and security requirements, the “application programming interfaces” (APIs), to access the payment system’s data and functionality.      APIs are like clever personal assistants who speak multiple languages and can easily perform common tasks. You may not know how to send a message in French for one of your customers living in Dubai. But you call your PA and, a couple of minutes later, the right customer receives the message written in proper French in her house. That’s similar to what APIs do when you use a fintech app to check the balance in your bank account or to initiate a payment.      With the backend at the central bank, private parties, from banks to fintech and big tech firms, would take care of the front end: the “customer relations.” These private parties could offer all kinds of APIs and interface platforms to help persons and businesses plug into their central-bank accounts and use CBDCs from their cell phones, computers or other devices.    Open central banking    This technology already exists and is being used in jurisdictions that have adopted the initiative known as “open banking,” including the European Union, the U.K., Australia and, soon, Brazil. Under open banking rules, banks have to share, usually through APIs, customer information with other payments and financial services providers if the customer so chooses.      Any central bank could opt for this technological arrangement to start issuing CBDC soon enough, an initiative that could be called “open central banking.” But how would this platform model affect credit creation?      On the one hand, the central bank should not offer credit products, not even overdraft, for its new “customers.” Financial intermediation and credit allocation would remain with financial institutions so that central banks avoided giving up their role as monetary authority to become development banks.      See also: Marcelo M. Prates - Digital Dollars Can Reduce Unemployment, Here’s How      On the other hand, if banks lost much of their deposits to the central bank, they would have to find other sources of CBDC to fund lending operations. That is why banks, under the platform model, would be able to borrow CBDC from the central bank against a broader range of collateral, and for longer periods.      The additional CBDC liquidity would provide banks with stable and inexpensive funding that could be used to meet the demand for credit in the economy, thus avoiding credit freeze and spikes in interest rates. As an incentive, especially in times of crisis or persistent deflation, favored borrowing conditions based on the volume of bank loans to specific segments, like small businesses or green projects, could apply.      Again, this is nothing new in central banking. The European Central Bank has been offering targeted longer-term refinancing operations since 2014. The TLTROs, as they are known, allow banks that lend more to non-financial corporations and householdsto borrow more and at a lower interest rate from the ECB.      In light of all that, let us not dismiss direct CBDCs too quickly. If properly designed, they may well be the most promising option for a CBDC, if not the only one that can bring real change to the monetary system.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Marcelo M.

Now, according to Chinese news source The Paper, the very same institution – dubbed the central bank for central banks – is planning its own trial of a CBDC in collaboration with the Swiss central bank.      Presented by Benoit Coeure, head of the BIS Innovation Hub, at the Bund Summit in Shanghai, Oct. 23–25, the proof-of-concept initiative would be underway before then end of the year and would open a route to experimentation looking at use cases for a wholesale CBDC.      These could include how the digital currency might interoperate with existing payment systems, a role in digital identity and tracking financial compliance, per the report.      Such use cases would require more work on the blockchain technology underlying the CBDC, Coeure said.      BIS will also look into how to facilitate cross-border payments using digital currency between central banks such as including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Bank of Thailand.      Also read: CBDCs Mean Evolution, Not Revolution – Benoit Coeure      According to Coeure, the BIS Innovation Center is already carrying out experiments in Singapore, Switzerland and Hong Kong, and has plans to expand the work to Germany, France, the U.K., Sweden and Canada.      The comments from Coeure, who sat on the executive board of the European Central Bank (ECB) until last year, come soon after the BIS and seven central banks issued a report setting out the core principles for national digital currencies.      While many central banks are still publicly saying they are evaluating the technology, there appears to be a general movement towards rolling out national digital currencies in coming years. A digital euro is looking very likely, according to leaders at the ECB, and CBDC trials are planned in Russia, South Korea and Japan.      Driving the movement, has been the People's Bank of China, which has been in full development mode for several years and appears to be in the final stages before a live launch of a digital yuan.      Beating all nations to the final post, though, was the Bahamas, which launched its ""sand dollar"" CBDC last week.

42385010,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmWUp,1603719574,Silvergate Bank Sees 40% Increase in Deposits From Digital Currency Customers,"Silvergate Bank added $586 million in new deposits from firms and individuals in the cryptocurrency industry in the third quarter of 2020, according to an earnings report released before market-open on Monday.      This growth was around half of competitor Signature Bank’s increase of $1 billion in deposits from digital asset companies, but it’s the largest deposit increase Silvergate has seen since the bitcoin bull market in Q4 2017 when the bank saw quarter-over-quarter deposit growth of $835 million.      On an earnings call Monday, Silvergate executives credited the growth to strong price appreciation, the adoption of bitcoin as an investable asset class by corporate treasuries, and significant new funding from venture capital firms.      Only 5% of Silvergate’s third quarter deposits were interest bearing, demonstrating the rich source of low-cost deposits that the crypto industry offers the bank.      On the call, Silvergate CEO Alan Lane also pointed out that digital currency deposits are volatile week-to-week and month-to-month and can’t be invested in longer-term assets. Indeed, some of the assets fund Silvergate’s mortgage warehouse business, where the average duration of loans is less than two weeks.      The bank’s fee income for digital currency customers increased by nearly 40% to $3.3 million with more than 68,000 transactions on the Silvergate Exchange Network, a fiat on-ramp for bitcoin markets. The $36 billion that was transferred over the SEN in the third quarter 2020 exceeded the $32 billion that went over the payments network for the full year 2019.      “While the Fed’s zero interest rate policy will be a headwind for many, Silvergate has an exciting growth engine in the SEN,” Lane said. “We believe that as more fintech firms and corporate treasuries announce their investments in bitcoin, the ecosystem as a whole will continue to expand.”      Read more: Few Banks Will Touch Crypto Firms, but Silvergate Wants to Touch Bitcoin Itself      The bank added 47 new digital currency clients, bringing its total customer base from the industry up to 928. It also has 200 cryptocurrency clients in the pipeline or onboarding process, Lane said.      The majority of new customers – 33, Silvergate reported – were institutional investors. According to Lane, however, deposit increases from cryptocurrency customers were around even across customer segments.    Lending surge    The bank also saw a $13 million increase in its bitcoin-backed fiat loans, called SEN Leverage, up to $35.5 million in the third quarter. The bank also announced that SEN Leverage is out of pilot mode and ready to be offered at scale.      “It’s hard to say how big SEN Leverage could become,” said Ben Reynolds, executive vice president of corporate development at Silvergate Bank. “We believe that prudent underwriting, combined with the unique capabilities of the SEN to make loan advances 24 hours a day, seven days a week will enable us to grow the product in the coming quarters.”      From a regulatory capital point of view, the loans are 100% risk-weighted, said Silvergate CFO Tony Martino, meaning the loans are fully collateralized.      In the event that demand for bitcoin-backed fiat loans from Silvergate becomes more than what the bank is comfortable with, Lane said there are partners the bank will work with to cover the borrower demand. In this case, SEN Leverage would become a fee income opportunity as the bank lays off portions of the balance sheet to other lenders, he added.      Read more: Silvergate’s Bitcoin-Backed Lending Product Grew 80% in the Last Quarter      “We’ve got just under 600 institutional investor clients,” Lane added. “Let’s assume that every single one of them wanted a SEN Leverage loan. That’s $300 million right there. Some of them will want more. It probably wouldn’t be efficient to do much less than that.”      The bank also continues to be fairly conservative in its capital and leverage ratios. Its risk-based asset ratio – total capital to risk-based assets – is around 25%, compared to 12% to 14% at other banks. Its leverage ratio – or the measure of a bank’s core capital to its total assets – is around 11%, against a more typical (and more risky) 9% or 9.5% at its peers.

For example, users might be able to redeem the social currency for access to the currency's creator.      In a press release, IOSG's Jocy Lin wrote, ""Roll lets each creator have the freedom to determine the rules within their social economy.""      As one example, the musician Harrison First announced his social money, $FIRST, in August, promising it would allow people guest-list access when he's on tour.      As of this writing, one $FIRST trades for about $0.05 in ETH on Uniswap. By buying an artist's token early, though, a fan can theoretically make a bet on that creator's future success (provided, of course, they continue to support the token).

42385013,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmWYb,1603716611,First Mover: Bitcoin Steady Over $13K as JPMorgan Has Eureka! Moment,"Bitcoin was higher, appearing to hold above $13,000 for the first time since January 2018.      But the most drama in crypto markets came after an exploit of the decentralized finance protocol Harvest Finance sent the platform's native FARM token tumbling by 65% in less than an hour.      In traditional markets, European stocks slid as Spain declared a COVID-19 state of emergency and Italians were urged to stay home. U.S. equity futures pointed to a lower open on signs of a resurgence in the coronavirus and dimming hopes for a big stimulus package prior to the election. Gold was little changed.    Market moves    Bitcoin bulls are accustomed to the put-downs. The largest cryptocurrency has been lambasted in recent years as a ""fraud"" for having "" basically no value"" and for failing to qualify as ""a suitable investment.""      Now, as bitcoin mounts what might be its most durable rally in almost three years, the bulls may have to get used to a new sensation: vindication.      Analysts for JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, wrote Friday in a report that bitcoin has ""considerable"" price upside in the long term, as reported by CoinDesk's Zack Voell.      Bitcoin’s increasing use as an alternative to gold is amplified by millennials’ interest in cryptocurrency, according to the report, written by JPMorgan's global quantitative and derivatives strategy team.      “Even a modest crowding out of gold as an alternative currency over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from here,” the analysts wrote.      Such plaudits from the biggest of big U.S. banks represent a remarkable milestone for a digital asset launched in early 2009 with the specific aim of eliminating middlemen in payment systems.      And it's pretty hard to resist dredging up JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's memorable remark in 2017 that bitcoin was a ""fraud.""      ""If you're stupid enough to buy it, you'll pay the price for it one day,"" Dimon said at the time.      Lately, that price just keeps going up, buoyed by the growing belief among many crypto investors that bitcoin might serve as a hedge against trillions of dollars of centralbank money printing.      Bitcoin has climbed 82% in 2020, and it has doubled in value since Dimon made the disparaging remark in October 2017. Those who bought the cryptocurrency are looking smart compared with shareholders in JPMorgan, whose shares have tumbled 26% in 2020, leaving the stock price roughly where it stood three years ago.    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin’s technical charts are showing signs of temporary bull fatigue.      The cryptocurrency carved out a spinning top candle on Sunday, which occurs when an asset sees two-way price action during a specific period. It is widely considered a sign of indecision in the marketplace, especially when it appears following a notable rally, which is the case here.      The candle validates signals from another technical indicator, the 14-day relative strength index, where its reading of over 70 suggests the market is overbought. The immediate support is seen at $12,500 (horizontal line on the daily chart).      Dips could be short-lived, as the cryptocurrency’s long-term bull case has been bolstered by the online payments giant PayPal’s recent decision to announce support for bitcoin.      Also, several top public companies have recently disclosed their bitcoin holdings, providing a strong vote of confidence in the cryptocurrency's future.      Besides, the recent rally from $10,000 to $13,300 is backed by increased accumulation by large investors and looks sustainable.

Redbord joins TRM Labs as the company’s head of legal and government affairs. At Treasury, he served as a senior adviser to the under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. His resume also includes stints at FinCEN and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), in areas related to cryptocurrency.      Blockchain analytics is a hot space with the likes of Chainalysis tying up with law enforcement, Elliptic forensically following illicit money around the crypto ecosystem and CipherTrace building ""travel rule"" solutions and monitoring crypto compliance regimes.      So does the hire of Redbord mean TRM Labs is positioning itself alongside government crime-fighting agencies and law enforcement?      “I don’t think the focus will just be on the long arm of the law,” said Redbord. “Actually, I think in a way it’s quite the opposite, because a company like TRM allows for less regulation, quite frankly, by allowing governments around the world to be more comfortable that they are able to identify suspicious activity and get those bad actors out of this.”      Read more: PayPal Joins $4.2M Round for Crypto Banking Compliance Startup      The analytics firm’s data insights can be applied evenly to three different segments, said Esteban Castaño, TRM’s co-founder and CEO.

In its recently published set of draft instructions, the IRS now explains that tax payers would need to answer in the affirmative if they sold any cryptocurrency, exchanged cryptocurrency for goods or services, or exchanged cryptocurrency for property including other crypto assets.      It also sets out that respondents must answer ""yes"" if they received any cryptocurrency for free, including via airdrops or hard forks.

For example, holders of 10 bitcoin automatically owned 10 bitcoin cash after a hard fork in 2017.      The IRS draft guidance also makes clear taxpayers need not check yes if they merely held cryptocurrency in 2020, or moved it from one wallet to another owned by them.      The draft is likely to stand unless there are ""unexpected issues"" or new legislation requiring changes, the IRS said in the document.      With the IRS' paucity of guidelines on how to pay crypto taxes much criticized in recent years, the clarification may come as some relief to 1040 form returnees.

A report by Mashable on Saturday said Epik claimed in open letters that the PayPal block is due to ""anti-conservative bias.""  However, PayPal said it had ceased servicing the company over concerns about financial risk.  Epik provides hosting for sites run by far-right organizations including Gab and the Proud Boys, a violent group U.S. President Donald Trump recently refused to condemn (though he later changed his mind).  The firm has previously provided services for 8chan but eventually cut ties after it was used for posts by the perpetrator of a 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, the report said.  A Mashable source ""close to the situation"" suggested that PayPal's action may be over Epik's digital currency, Masterbucks, that is used to pay for domain services and can be exchanged for U.S. dollars.  The source said Epik had been touting the digital coin as a way to avoid certain taxes.  A previous version (archived here) of the Epik website said Masterbucks has ""tax advantages"" for people ""planning to dispose of domains in order to fund the development of other domains.""  PayPal reached out to Epik a month ago to remedy the situation, according to letters to the payment firm posted on the domain registrar's blog.  It asked questions about money transmission licenses, anti-money laundering, ""offshore numbered accounts,"" ""cross‐border activities and law enforcement.""  Epik called the questions ""absolutely absurd and well outside of any knowledge or experience we have as a domain registrar,"" and described the action as intended to ""deplatform conservative voices.""

42384996,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmWBx,1603703100,Tether Froze $300K of Stablecoin Hacked After Victims Left Wallet Keys in Evernote,"The U.S. government is pursuing a civil forfeiture claim on more than 300,000 units of the tether (USDT) cryptocurrency after they were reported stolen in a hack earlier this year.      The funds, co-owned by Shixuan Cai and business partner Lin Jian Chen, were later frozen by operator Tether Ltd. after Cai reported the theft to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in April, court documents filed on Thursday show.      Now the U.S. government wants to finalize the legal seizure of those assets, saying they are in violation of Section 1030 of the Civil Forfeiture code, for ""fraud and related activity in connection with computers.""      Back in February, Cai purchased 300,900 USDT – a stablecoin linked to the price of the U.S. dollar – through the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Cai then transferred those funds to a personal wallet co-owned and managed with Chen.      Just four minutes after Cai had transferred the tether from Binance to the personal wallet, the funds were transferred again, but without the business pair's permission, to a wallet address ending in 8869.      Hours later the funds were split, with two-thirds (200,600 USDT) of the funds going to yet another wallet address ending in 44c2, while 100,301 USDT remained in the 8869 wallet.      Cai contacted Chen the following day attempting to uncover how the funds had been moved, learning Chen had recorded their private key, used for authorizing transfers from their wallet, in an Evernote account.      Read more: Total Stablecoin Supply Nearly Doubled in Q3, Adding Record $8B      Evernote is a note-taking and task management application that stores information on the cloud and is accessible across multiple devices owned by an individual or individuals if shared.      Hackers masking their IP address through a virtual private network (VPN) found the wallet key in Evernote and conducted multiple intrusions between Jan. 26 and Feb. 5, Chen later learned.      The key was used to authorize the transaction from their personal wallet to the destination wallet ending in 8869. Cai reported the theft two months later on April 9 to both Tether Ltd. and the LAPD. The funds were temporarily frozen by Tether pending an investigation.      A week later, Special Agent Patrick Leighton of the U.S Secret Service (USSS) was contacted by a Tether representative, who said an unidentified individual was requesting a lifting of the freeze on the USDT so the person could transfer the USDT to another cryptocurrency.      Leighton asked Tether to provide the unidentified individual's contact details and request the individual to get in touch with the agent. Shortly after, Leighton was contacted by an individual who identified himself only as “Kamil,” using the email address “qlYyq2t5iKIbBfxu@protonmail.ch.""      Kamil told Leighton the funds originally belonging to Cai and Chen were transferred to him by an unidentified business partner who in turn had received the funds from an undisclosed person in China.      The China-based individual was said to have asked Kamil to handle the transfer of Cai and Chen's funds to purchase ether on the Kyber network because they were ""not familiar with cryptocurrency.""      Kamil claimed he wanted to split Cai and Chen's funds into equal amounts over three wallets and that he would receive 15% of the total funds for conducting the intended transactions on behalf of his partner.      No further details were provided to Leighton regarding the alleged partner, with Kamil claiming he had already destroyed evidence of his partner's information.      See also: Chinese Authorities Crack Down on Gambling Sites Using Tether Stablecoin      By May, Judge Pedro Castillo of the U.S Central District Court of California issued a seizure warrant for the roughly 300,000 USDT and in June issued an order extending the time for the USSS to execute the warrant.      At that time, Tether Ltd. unfroze the stablecoin funds at the behest of the USSS before the warrant was executed and the funds transferred to a wallet controlled by the U.S. government.      ""Tether routinely assists law enforcement agents and seeks to further their legitimate objectives,"" Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino told CoinDesk. ""Tether will always play by the rules, obey the law, and try to be supportive of the wider digital token community.""      Cai and Chen's stolen crypto assets will remain in the government's possession subject to the Court’s jurisdiction pending the U.S. government's claim of fraud, court documents show.      The case is a reminder never to leave any wallet keys or recovery phrases stored online where they may be accessed by bad actors.      Edit (12:00 UTC, Oct. 26 2020): Adds comment from Tether.

A possible exploit in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Harvest Finance has sent the platform’s native token, FARM, tumbling by 65% in less than an hour, according to CoinGecko.      According to reports surfacing early Monday, upwards of $25 million in value has been drained from Harvest Finance pools and swapped for renBTC (rBTC) by an unknown attacker. Other funds have been mixed through Tornado Cash, an Ethereum obfuscation software. Following the attack, investors appear to have pulled roughly $350 million from the site.      “We are working actively on the issue of mitigating the economic attack on the Stablecoin and BTC pools, and will update in this thread in realtime (sic) as soon as additional details are available,” the anonymous team behind Harvest Finance said in a tweet.      The team further said the “economic attack” was made possible by manipulating stablecoin prices on Curve Finance, another DeFi protocol that Harvest Finance contracts interact with.      Read More: Uniswap, Curve Daily Trading Volumes Surges Past $2B, Likely Driven by Harvest Attack      The project’s admins claim to have withdrawn “100% of stablecoin and BTC curve strategy funds” to the vault and “are moving to block deposits to the Stablecoin and BTC vault,” the Harvest Team said in the project’s Discord at 4:45 UTC.      Harvest Finance did not return questions by press time.      The attack comes after DeFi analyst Chris Blec claimed Harvest Finance’s administrators held an “admin key that can drain funds” locked in the protocol’s contracts. It’s unclear at this stage in the exploit what role the admin key or the anonymous team behind the protocol have to do with the sudden drain in assets. Blec did not return a request for comment by press time.      Harvest Finance had over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) just prior to the possible exploit being unveiled. TVL has dropped to $673 million as of 5:00 UTC, according to DeFi Pulse.
