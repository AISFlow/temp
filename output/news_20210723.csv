The announcement was made via their official Twitter handle. The Stake Pool program was enabled via an on-chain governance process, as the Solana Foundation said. Any SOL holder can participate in the process via SolFlare, a non-custodial wallet that allows users to connect with this network. SOL token holders can earn rewards and help secure the network by staking tokens to one or more validators. Rewards for staked tokens are based on the current inflation rate, total number of SOL staked on the network, and an individual validator&apos;s uptime and commission (fee). The program was launched to increase the network ability to withstand disruption or attacks, the Solana Foundation said. This capacity is partially measured by looking at the &apos;superminority&apos;, the smallest number of validators capable of launching a successful attack. Thus, the Stake Pools operate as incentives for the users to place their SOL funds between independent validators, the announcement clarified.

42434894,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuHrh,1627071538,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Analysts Expect a Short-Squeeze,"Bitcoin pulled back on Friday after rising nearly 10% earlier this week. The cryptocurrency was trading around $32,000 at press time and is up about 2% over the past seven days. Ether, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, is holding above $2,000 and is up about 6% over the past week.      Upside momentum is improving, which could keep crypto buyers active into the weekend. Some analysts expect a short-squeeze to push bitcoin above the 50-day moving average around $34,000 given oversold conditions on the charts.      “For the first time in many weeks we are seeing bullish signs here and expect bitcoin to head towards the upper end of the $30,000-$40,000 range,” wrote Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, in an email to CoinDesk.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $32,324.8, -0.05%  Ether (ETH) $2,026.5, -0.13%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4411.8, +1.01%  Gold: $1801, -0.32%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.281%, compared with 1.263% on Thursday    “On the options front we have seen a good amount of covering between the $35,000-$40,000 strikes for the weekly maturity,” Balani wrote. “For the July expiry there is still decent open interest in the $35,000 strike, which should act as a ceiling for BTC for this month.”      Overall, risk sentiment is improving in traditional and crypto markets as concerns about tighter monetary stimulus wane. On Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) pledged to keep interest rates lower for longer and adjusted its policy stance to allow for a slight overshoot of the 2% inflation target.      The ECB announcement along with a broad decline in global government bond yields contributed to higher stock prices over the past week. Aside from the reach for yield, improving sentiment and positive comments from Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday kept crypto bulls active.    Bitcoin options probability    Bitcoin options traders are pricing an 8% chance of the cryptocurrency rising to a new peak above $64,800 by Dec. 31, according to data source Skew.      Additionally, six-month implied volatility, or investors’ expectations for price turbulence, has dropped to a more than two-month low of 80% at press time, having peaked at 122% on May 17.      That implies investors expect the price consolidation to continue for a while, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.    Short squeeze expected    “If BTC retains the lower range of $30K, shorts will begin to squeeze as BTC moves to the middle point of the range, likely accelerating in the coming days/weeks,” wrote Sashimi Nakamoto on CryptoQuant.      The chart below shows the bitcoin leverage ratio, which is open interest divided by exchange reserves, reaching the highest level since April. The bitcoin funding rate is slightly negative, which indicates higher short interest than long interest, according to Nakamoto.      The funding rate measures the cost to fund long positions in the market for bitcoin perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in the cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets.    Crypto fund flows weaken    Since June, total assets under management across exchange-traded and over-the-counter-traded digital asset investment products decreased by 14% to $34.8 billion.      Compared with traditional asset classes, digital asset markets still have a “long way to go before more risk-averse investors are fully at ease,” according to a report by CryptoCompare.    NFT impact on ether price    As non-fungible tokens gain popularity despite an overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market, some NFT critics inside the market took to Twitter, blaming the non-crypto natives who cash out their ether immediately after NFT sales for the lackluster price movement of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.      But according to multiple analysts and market participants, the impact of NFT sales, if any at all, remains a nonfactor on ether’s price. Instead, the complaint showcases many traders and investors’ frustrations in a dull market.      The speculation “is more like a reflection of the current market sentiment,” Daniel Lv, co-founder of China-based blockchain Nervos Network, told CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen through a representative.      The blame, though, isn’t completely irrational because growth in the NFT market has not quite slowed down partly because of the large number of endorsements it has received from non-crypto celebrities.    Altcoin roundup  AXS price doubles in two days: The governance token of the Axie Infinity platform, AXS, has doubled in price since Wednesday. As of Friday the AXS token was trading at a new all-time high price of $30, implying a year-to-date gain of over 5,700%. Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as “axies,” which are digitized as their own NFTs.  RUNE tumbles: Thorchain’s token, RUNE, tumbled in digital-asset markets after the blockchain suffered an exploit for the second time in two weeks, this one costing about $8 million. The RUNE price was $3.65 as of press time, down 22% over the past 24 hours, in the worst performance among digital assets tracked by Messari with a market capitalization of at least $500 million. The token has lost some 80% since hitting an all-time high price in May. Thorchain said late Thursday it was hit by an exploit, reported to have cost around $8 million. Last week, the protocol was drained of around 4,000 ether (ETH, -0.11%) ($8.2 million) in another incident.  Karura Swap opens for trading: The first decentralized exchange on the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem has been launched by Karura, the DeFi network of the Acala Foundation.  Tron blockchain: Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain network, said the recent explosive growth on Tron is being overshadowed by better known rival Polygon. Though the total value locked in Polygon surpasses that in Tron, Tron is growing faster in other areas, gaining traction lately with impressive growth in stablecoin.

42434885,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuHXh,1627070445,The Node: Europe's Hidden Agenda on Crypto Wallets,"On Wednesday, I covered the misleading messaging around Europe’s proposed new anti-money laundering law, which was advertised as “banning anonymous crypto wallets.” That wasn’t really true – the law affects only third-party custodians, not software or hardware wallets.      However, it turns out the rules, while not banning self-hosted anonymous wallets, could indirectly strangle them.    ​​This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The provisions, and the larger strategy behind them, point to genuinely scary encroachments on financial freedom and should be opposed.      On the other hand, these pernicious portions of the European Union rules could be narrowed or removed before they are slated to be implemented in 2024. According to members of Europe’s Data Protection Authority, they may violate Europe’s recently implemented ""General Data-Protection Rules,"" or GDPR.      The poison pill is in article 58 of the proposed rules (full PDF here):      “Owners and beneficiaries of existing anonymous accounts, anonymous passbooks, anonymous safe-deposit boxes or crypto asset wallets shall be subject to customer due diligence measures before those accounts, passbooks, deposit boxes or crypto-asset wallets are used in any way.”      According to Simon Lelieveldt, compliance adviser for the Dutch crypto exchange Bitonic, this language would require that both the owners of hosted crypto wallets and the owner of any crypto wallet they transact with, including self-hosted wallets, be subject to know-your-customer procedures under the new rules. (At least in the U.S. we tend to use “beneficiary” to mean the recipient of assets after the owner’s death, but in this context, it just means transaction recipients.)      This, Lelieveldt argues, is part of a larger strategy to kill anonymous crypto wallets.      “In sum, the travel rule is used as a wedge to push decentralized [wallets] into a legitimate custody world, making all else illegitimate and criminalized,” he told CoinDesk. “And it will be used to ban anonymous wallets from existing in the regulated world. Hence the expressed intentions of the (European) Commission are correct.”      Lelieveldt delves into the point in this excellent Twitter thread, and has written at length about Bitonic’s successful confrontation with similar rules.      It’s hard to say whether European authorities fully comprehend how draconian, malicious and outright absurd this measure is. At the highest level, it could be seen as making it illegal for any custodial crypto account holder to withdraw their holdings as cash. It sets a European agenda fundamentally hostile to the right to transact privately on the internet.      It’s also very hard to imagine how it would work. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which broadly sets the agenda for international anti-money-laundering (AML) measures, itself says it “is not aware of any technically proven means of identifying the person that manages or owns an unhosted wallet, precisely and accurately in all circumstances.” Any system for linking identities to on-chain wallets would be subject to errors and abuse, for deep technological reasons.      But even more disturbing is the indirect nature of the initiative. As I wrote Wednesday, the proposed rules do nothing to directly “ban” self-hosted wallets. But they would create a huge moat between third-party hosted wallets and self-hosted wallets, significantly undermining the utility of cryptocurrencies. Like residents of urban neighborhoods bifurcated by U.S. expressways in the mid-20th century, crypto users would be cut off from each other, undermining the technology’s promise of peer-to-peer transactions.      Shockingly, this is an explicit enforcement strategy floated by the FATF in a March guidance document on virtual assets, (thanks again to Lelieveldt for the tip here). The document includes a list of “options to mitigate risks posed by P2P [peer-to-peer] transactions at a national level if the ML/TF (money laundering/terrorism financing) risks are unacceptably high. This includes measures that seek to bring greater visibility to P2P transactions, as well as to limit jurisdiction’s exposure to P2P transactions.”      (Remind yourself here that “jurisdictions’ exposure to P2P transactions” is a synonym for “citizens’ rights to transact freely.”)      The FATF’s third recommendation for controlling peer-to-peer transactions is “denying licensing of VASPs (virtual asset service providers) if they allow transactions to/from non-obliged entities (i.e., private or unhosted wallets).    The GDPR problem    Now, there is some good (and fairly funny) news here. Before the draft AML rules were circulated publicly, the European Financial Commission received a fairly stern letter from the European Data Protection Board (EDPR), which oversees the enforcement of Europe’s General Data Protection Rule. When it was implemented, GDPR was largely seen in the context of social media and advertising, coming as it did in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.      But the Data Protection Board is making it crystal clear that it regards financial data as subject to GDPR, too. And though the letter tiptoes around the issue, it hints that the board may regard the proposed new AML framework as flawed.      “The EDPB ... has repeatedly noted the privacy and data protection challenges related to the AML framework … a fair balance has to be struck between the interest to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, on the one hand, and the interests underlying the fundamental rights to data protection and privacy, on the other,” the letter said.      The board points to principles including “data minimization” and “necessity and proportionality” as key to crafting AML regulations that don’t violate GDPR. Digging into these is a task for another day. But suffice it to say that requiring transactors’ detailed personal information be sent with every large financial transaction, as current AML rules often do, does not mesh easily with those principles.      “Why broadcast 99.8% of redundant data of innocent citizens via the payment channels to capture 0.2% of the people [committing crimes],” Lelieveldt asks, “in a day and age where other surveillance technologies are better suited? Data breaches [of financial services] are just around the corner.” Rules requiring on-demand delivery of data about suspicious transactions to police, he says, would be just as effective while preserving privacy.      The new AML rules, moreover, could create a perverse incentive for companies whose data-centric business models are being threatened by rising privacy standards such as GDPR and Apple’s recent opt-in tracking feature.      Companies like “Cambridge Analytica (or Facebook itself) will jump at the opportunity to use the FATF-crypto travel rule to push all the customer data along to all business partners under the pretense of complying with FATF rules,” Lelieveldt warns.      It would be great if cooler heads prevail and Europe’s AML rules are revised before they’re implemented. But whatever the letter of the law, it seems unlikely that the Data Protection Board has the heft to go up against the Finance Commission, which can just start talking about “terrorist financing” and use fear to push through pretty much whatever it wants.      Fighting back is going to require broad resistance. It’s time for loud voices from around the world to make themselves heard.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

The funding is part of Celsius' planned $200 million investment in bitcoin mining in North America, according to the company. Celsius said the investment, which occurred during the second quarter, would make it one of the largest U.S. investors in the bitcoin mining industry.      Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky described the deal with Core in a CoinDesk interview as ""good for our community."" He added: ""They have a lot of assets. That's safer than just investing in a [decentralized finance] project.""      Core Scientific is the largest host of bitcoin mining machines in North America.      The announcement comes just two days after Core Scientific said that it planned to list its shares on Nasdaq through a merger with Power & Digital Infrastructure Acquisition. The miner will have a value of $4.3 billion.      In May, Michael Levitt, the co-founder and chairman of Core Scientific, took over as CEO after Kevin Turner stepped down.      Mashinsky sees these developments positively, noting that the merger would allow Core ""to raise even more money.""      ""Companies go through changes all the time,"" he said.      He also highlighted Core's carbon-neutral infrastructure.

42434893,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuHnh,1627062087,"Money Reimagined: Regulate Stablecoins, Don’t Smother Them","The 2021 start of the Northern Hemisphere summer may go down as the moment in which U.S. regulators suddenly woke up to the reality of stablecoins.      The pendulum from neglect to laser focus may now have swung too far. The risk now is that regulators are moving too fast and might apply a blunt, catch-all solution to a complex issue that demands nuance.      The wake-up started late last month when Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, detailed what he saw as the risks these stable-value tokens pose to the financial system. Rosengren’s take was followed by an almost diametrically opposed position from Randal Quarles, the Fed’s vice governor, who gave a surprisingly forward-thinking speech calling on the U.S. to encourage stablecoin innovation.    You’re reading an excerpt from Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Then, this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened a meeting of the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets to discuss stablecoin regulation. It included top-ranking officials from the Treasury, the Fed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.      Not much has been forthcoming from those talks, but one attendee, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, suggested some stablecoins whose prices depend on the performance of traditional securities might themselves be securities and so subject to his agency’s oversight. Gensler’s staff is working to meet a demand from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) that the SEC lay out a broader framework for crypto regulation by July 28.    Systemic risks?    It’s not just letters from U.S. senators that have stirred regulators into action. It’s also the remarkable growth of stablecoins.      As you’ll see below in the newsletter’s chart section, the total value outstanding from the top 10 stablecoins – including Tether’s USDT, Circle’s USDC, Binance’s BUSD and MakerDAO’s DAI – now stands at $108.7 billion. That’s up fourfold from the start of this year and three times more than the $35.6 billion that PayPal Holdings held on account for its PayPal and Venmo customers at the end of the first quarter.      This explosive growth – along with the aggressive investigation of leading stablecoin issuer Tether by the New York attorney general’s office, which ended in a settlement requiring greater transparency from the company on the breakdown of the reserves that back its tokens – has raised concerns about “systemic risk.”      That’s a phrase that conjures memories of the 2008 financial crisis, when investors were dumping assets to cover their rapidly evaporating mortgage investments, creating a de facto “bank run” on the financial system. The fear is that in a world where reserve-backed stablecoins are ubiquitous, doubts about the size, quality and liquidity of the assets backing the tokens could exacerbate a financial crisis. Mass stablecoin redemptions could bankrupt their issuers, critics say, and create a similar effect of panic and cascading credit risks across the economy.      It is the legitimate responsibility of governments to mitigate such risks. In fact, boosting confidence in that way would likely be a boon for stablecoin usage, much as the provision of federal deposit insurance did for the U.S. banking system in 1933.      So regulation should be welcome by the industry. But what will that regulation look like? Will it encourage or restrict innovation and access? And will the right rules be applied to the right scenarios? Or will a one-size-fits-all approach be applied that does more harm than good?      Haste is not conducive to the kind of nuanced regulatory approach that’s needed. Nor are alarmist analogies such as “bank runs,” which for various reasons don’t really apply here.    History lessons    Some of the urgency was stoked this week by Gary Gorton, an economist at the Yale School of Management, and Jeffery Zhang, an attorney at the Fed. In a paper that was no doubt placed in front of all members of the President’s Working Group, they called on the U.S. government to extend “public money” control over “private money” stablecoins – either by compelling them to be federally regulated as banks or by replacing them with a central bank digital currency.      “If policymakers wait a decade” to act, the paper authors argued, “stablecoin issuers will become the money market funds of the 21st century – too big to fail – and the government will have to step in with a rescue package whenever there’s a financial panic.”    Haste and hurry can only bear children with many regrets along the way.    To make their point, the authors used the United States’ 19th-century experience with underegulated “wildcat banking,” when different banknotes issued by private banks circulated, sometimes at varying prices relative to their nominal at-par value. But the Cato Institute’s Selgin, a monetary historian and a guest on our podcast this week, tore apart the analogy in a convincing tweet thread. Reading it, one is left with the idea that that past experience with “private money,” if stripped of 19th-century constraints around geographic and information transparency that shouldn’t exist in the digital age, shows its potential for the 21st century.      For the most part, Selgin wrote, the private banknotes traded at par within the states to which the banks belonged and were discounted only when they were carried across state lines to places far from where they could be physically redeemed in those banks’ branches.      Selgin noted that a 10% federal tax was needed to stop people from using the state banknotes, which meant that “despite their inability to pass at par everywhere,” users considered them “good as if not better for certain purposes than their national counterparts.”      Contrary to popular myth, Selgin continued, shutting the so-called wildcat banks did not deliver efficiency payoffs to many poorer Southern states, whose post-Civil War development was held back for decades because of insufficient credit in the wake of the state banks’ closures.    Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?    Fast forward to the more transparent, digitally ubiquitous model that the internet affords, and it’s hard to see how discounting, by itself, is a big enough problem to offset the optionality and innovation that stablecoins offer to users. If everyone recognizes that a sought-after token is not the equivalent of national fiat currency but is merely expected to hold close to its value, then people will continue to use it for convenience, programmability and ease of access.      Certainly, if you look at the 90-day trading price for USDT and that of USDC on CoinGecko, that’s what the market is telling us. The prices vary by a few cents with the ebb and flow of demand and supply, but average around $1.00. Is that a problem? Every major user has known the questionable state of Tether’s reserves for months, if not years. But they don’t worry about it because they can see the price any time and adjust their contracts accordingly.    What kind of regulation?    This is not to argue regulation wouldn’t be valuable. Rules to compel transparency could further breed overall confidence in the system so that price spreads narrow even further.      And it might be that a heavier-handed bank charter model, one that removes all doubt about the par value of 100%-reserved tokens, is needed to get large compliance-constrained corporates to use stablecoins and ramp up their usage across the economy.      Certainly, that’s what Long, the other guest on this week’s podcast, is betting on. Long is the founder and CEO of Avanti Bank, which took advantage of Wyoming’s new crypto-friendly special purpose depository institution (SPDI) bank charter and is using that to lobby the Fed backing for its new digital dollar token, Avit.      Yet stablecoins and digital dollars come in many flavors. A one-size-fits-all solution would be problematic.      As Gensler noted, some stablecoins could be securities. And as Gorton and Zhang note, Tether’s terms and conditions give it equity issuer-like optionality on how and when to honor redemptions, unlike other reserve-backed stablecoin issuers, which treat their customers’ fund deposits as debt obligations. Perhaps Tether should be regulated as a money market fund, but the others as deposit takers. How will that distinction affect the market?      And what about “synthetic” stablecoins such as Dai, an ERC20 token whose value is managed algorithmically by smart contracts over the Ethereum blockchain – and which got no mention in Gorton and Zhang’s paper. They aren’t reserve-backed at all. Are they now illegal? Who’s the regulated person or entity in a case where the system is run by a decentralized community? The thousands of geographically scattered Ethereum nodes that execute the smart contracts?      One could take the argument of Rohan Grey – an assistant professor of Willamette University College of Law who drafted a bill for Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich) calling for all stablecoins to require banking licenses that the developers of MakerDAO protocol behind Dai. But as difficult as that already is to enforce, it is about to become even harder now that the legal entity they formed, the Maker Foundation, is shutting down and turning over governance to a decentralized autonomous organization.      If regulators are serious about promoting innovation, financial access for all and the freedom to produce code, regulators will have to work through these issues deliberately and carefully.

Under FATF standards to prevent money laundering and terror funding, the originator and recipient of funds being transferred need to be identified.  The rule should be applied consistently across the financial services industry, “regardless of the technology being used to facilitate transfers” the Treasury said in a consultation document published Thursday.  Existing regulations don’t transfer smoothly to crypto because of peculiarities of the sector and need to be adapted, it said.  “Cryptoasset firms will need to put in place systems for ensuring that personal information of the originator and beneficiary of a cryptoasset transfer is transmitted and received alongside the transfer, in an appropriate format,” according to the document.  The document includes several proposals from FATF's proposals, among them the suggestion that beneficiaries should be prevented from withdrawing amounts above £1,000 if required information is missing.

42434879,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuHLh,1627055823,Washington Should Let DeFi Succeed,"A new form of consumer finance could upend the entire banking and finance system that’s plagued by expensive fees, limited “bankers hours,” public mistrust, bailouts and insider government favors.      But Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may kill the movement – decentralized finance, or DeFi – in the name of our own protection. Regulators should prosecute fraud, but also acknowledge the limits of their effectiveness and allow DeFi to mature without the burden of governmental compliance.    Paul H. Jossey is an adjunct fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and founder of thecrowdfundinglawyers.com.    People are on the verge of cutting out the middleman in finance. Just as Bitcoin decentralized money transfers, DeFi could decentralize all of finance, from lending, borrowing and exchanging to more exotic forms of interest collection.      DeFi eschews heavily regulated, fee-collecting intermediaries to allow peer-to-peer money flows. In just three years, it has grown from an idea on Meetup to a $50 billion industry. Yet DeFi’s astounding growth has also attracted opportunists looking to fleece naïve newcomers. Hackers and rug pullers – developers creating new products and then absconding with the loot – have plagued the growing industry. According to one source, fraudsters stole $83.4 million between January and April this year.      Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D.-Mass.) fired off a letter asking SEC Chairman Gary Gensler what more Congress could do to empower the commission to rein in DeFi. Mr. Gensler needs no persuading. He has repeatedly made requests for additional authority to bring non-security cryptocurrencies under the SEC’s ambit. Dan Berkovitz, a commissioner at the SEC’s sister agency, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), recently agreed. While praising financial intermediaries, he described DeFi as a “bad idea, and “Hobbesian,” and questioned its legality.      The message from the Biden administration and its appointees is clear: Without us, scams will proliferate and retail investors will get hosed.    Read more: State of Crypto: Congressional Hearings Are Ramping Up    Bringing a nascent industry under the government’s thumb does have benefits for politicians and regulators. It provides politicians steady campaign contributions and lobbying perks. Regulators get employment, prestige and often lucrative post-public service landing spots. Industry incumbents use the rules to keep barriers to entry high.      But big government hasn’t been great at preventing fraud. Since the federal government started regulating the financial sector in earnest in the 1930s, the government’s track record has been downright dismal. A landmark study by future Nobel laureate George Stigler showed the rates of return in the 1950s mirrored those of the pre-SEC 1920s, dispelling the myth that 1920s Wall Street was rife with fraud and abuse.      Decades later, two scholars lamented, “[Ex]amination of the securities violations...reveals that no amount of technical exemption requirements will hinder the fraud artists from their endeavors...Fraudulent and deceptive schemes have unfortunately continued unabated and independent of formal registration or exemption requirements.”      Even Congress’s own research arm, the Congressional Research Service, is skeptical the SEC framework can remedy market manipulation.    Regulators should allow DeFi to flourish as it upends the decades-old order and renders entrenched industry players irrelevant.    Regulators should focus on prosecuting fraud and allow the industry to grow past its infancy without smothering it first with massive federal disclosure mandates. Many scams and rug pulls had glaring red flags, like anonymous developers and promises of outlandish returns like 10,000 percent interest. The market will weed these scammers out.      As the industry matures, industry gatekeepers will develop standards that imbue credibility. These standard setters will include trade associations, code auditors, insurance markets and standards bodies that provide reputation scores to counter the proliferation of bad actors.      Regulators should prosecute scams harshly. Federal courts have buttressed CFTC jurisdiction to prosecute crypto fraud. Politicians will score points and regulators will avoid blame by taking the path that gives them the most power and control. But some humility on the limits of their effectiveness would be welcome.      Previous attempts to rein in finance’s bad actors fell flat. The notorious Dodd Frank financial regulation law passed after the 2008 financial crisis has utterly failed. The push to regulate DeFi will, as well. At best, it will send DeFi underground.      Regulators should allow DeFi to flourish as it upends the decades-old order and renders entrenched industry players irrelevant. Suffocating DeFi in the name of investor protection will kill its promise and continue the entrenchment of massive industry insiders as overlords of the U.S. financial system.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Paul Jossey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/23/washington-should-let-defi-succeed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f3d3508b5dba018472ef7e359368485e09b2912-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The services are currently being offered to a limited number of clients, and the bank has been reviewing the matter internally as it eyes rolling out these services to a wider number of customers, the sources said.  Goldman Sachs isn’t the only bank making such a move. Bank of America, as reported by CoinDesk earlier in the week, has also been offering the clearing and settlement of cryptocurrency ETPs for hedge funds, as the adoption of crypto by institutions gathers pace.  Earlier this week the Financial Times reported that BNY Mellon has backed a new crypto trading platform called Pure Digital, following in the footsteps of its rival State Street. The move into crypto ETPs follows the relaunch of Goldman’s cryptocurrency trading desk in March.  Bank of America has also approved the trading of bitcoin futures for some clients and is clearing cash-settled contracts, CoinDesk reported last week.  Crypto ETPs are traded on an exchange, much like equities and ETFs, and track the performance of an underlying asset. Their popularity has been growing as they allow clients to invest in crypto without having to invest in the underlying digital assets themselves.  In June, ETC Group launched the first bitcoin ETP in the U.K. on the Aquis Exchange in London. There has also been an increasing number of cryptocurrency ETPs being listed on Switzerland’s SIX Exchange and on Germany’s Deutsche Boerse.

42434892,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuHlh,1627050443,What Is Bitcoin Freedom?,"Bitcoin promotes freedom. It enables anyone, anywhere to send, receive or store their wealth. It also prevents governments or corporations from meddling in these transactions. But what type of freedom does Bitcoin provide? Is it a freedom to use or store digital cash or the freedom from an overreaching state?      Isaiah Berlin introduced the dichotomy of negative and positive freedom in his famous essay ""Two Conceptions of Liberty.” The negative conception of freedom refers to the absence of something, or the freedom from interference, barriers or constraints. This is also called “liberal freedom,” as in the liberal right to speech or religion without government intervention. The positive conception of freedom, on the other hand, is described as the ability to do something with the aim of realizing a goal or more fully reach one’s potential.    Burak Tamac, Ph.D., is the community manager for CryptoQuant in Turkey.  Crypto Questioned is a forum to discuss the ideas and philosophies that drive the cryptocurrency industry.    However, Phillip Pettit and Quentin Skinner independently excavated a third, alternative conception of freedom. This “new” version was nestled in the writings of ancient Republican Rome. They introduced it as the freedom from domination or dependence. It's this type of freedom that Bitcoin makes space for.      Republican freedom is both a negative concept because it is based on the absence of something, in this case, domination, and a positive one because it relies on active citizenship. For this reason, it offers a more comprehensive approach to freedom than Berlin's binary, especially with respect to government and politics.      The American Revolution against British domination is a suitable example: The U.S. Declaration of Independence specifies the term “independence” as “independence from the British Crown"" (read: domination).    Can we be free under a benign master?    Freedom in the republican sense is a social status, like the distinction between a master and a slave. Under such a system, interference does not have to be exercised – the master does not have to crack his whip – for it to be present: The mere existence of external, obtrusive forces makes one unfree.      Liberal freedom, on the other hand is the condition of being free as long as a master does not interfere arbitrarily. Don’t tread on me.      Pettit, of the republican tradition, elaborates on the above condition and claims that a democratically deliberated and consented (possibly also contested) interference does not always reduce freedom, but instead enhances it because the democratic process facilitates choice. It's about self-mastery.    Was Ulysses dominated by his sailors?    Take Ulysses' encounter with the sirens. In order to escape the intoxicating song of the sirens, Ulysses ordered his sailors to bound him to their ship's mast. Technically, his men interfered with the Homeric hero's ability to act as he wished, but did not dominate him because Ulysses himself authorized the interference.      Similarly, taxes imposed on citizens might not be an arbitrary interference if they ""track the welfare and worldview of those affected,” as Pettit said. For republican freedom, only arbitrary interference can make one unfree.    Bitcoin blockchain freedom    If we turn now to the subject of the Bitcoin protocol, mainstream arguments regarding its political dimensions often center around its “absence of interference from a central authority.” That pivotal aspect of the blockchain is negative freedom writ large.    Bitcoin is based not on the idea of liberal freedom, but on republican freedom.    Blockchain, however, not only has the advantage of being free from outside interference but also implements various mechanisms agreed upon by its governance protocols to secure that freedom.      From the above perspective, then, Bitcoin is based not on the idea of liberal freedom, but on republican the ideal. The Bitcoin blockchain provides security and ownership of data by administering the mechanisms of a trustless, transparent and decentralized system. Any ""interference"" to Bitcoin's protocol has to be deliberated on, and consented to, by the core developers and node operators before it is approved and implemented.      The Taproot upgrade, exemplifies this nonarbitrary intervention at its best. After years of deliberation, the “Speedy Trial” process started early this year. The process was designed to last three months, with signaling, i.e. voting, occurring every two weeks. To approve the proposal, at least 90% of the blocks mined within two weeks had to signal approval to the Taproot upgrade. On June 14, more than 99% of the blocks had an approval signal for the Taproot proposal.    Read more: Locked In: Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Gets Its 90% Mandate    In comparison, amending the U.S. Constitution requires only a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Then it must be ratified by three-fourths of the legislatures in the 50 states. If the degree of consensus across a wide body of people is a measure of success, then the Taproot upgrade did very well as it attained the required minimum of 90% approval.      Since the Bitcoin blockchain protocol promises both negative freedom (“Don’t Tread on Me”) and positive freedom (“We the People”), as with republican freedom, it attracts not only libertarians but also progressives. This final point, by the way – drawing in people from a varied ideological spectrum – helps to understand why supporters of blockchain technology, in general, cannot be easily confined inside any specific ideological box.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Burak Tamac,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/23/what-is-bitcoin-freedom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e26624340ec9264b94c785c7ad397ee1e0b925cf-1024x819.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434877,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuHHh,1627049015,Axie Infinity Token Price Doubles in 2 Days,"The governance token of the Axie Infinity platform, AXS, has doubled in price since Wednesday.      As of Friday the AXS token was trading at a new all-time high price of $30, implying a year-to-date gain of over 5,700%.      Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as “axies,” which are digitized as their own non-fungible tokens (NFT).      According to research from TheTie, Axie Infinity has quickly become one of the highest-revenue projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Axie Infinity's revenue is up over 17,000% since April 1 as user growth accelerated dramatically during the second quarter.      According to research boutique firm Delphi Digital, Axie Infinity is projected to end the year with total revenue of over $1 billion. (Delphi has disclosed that it has invested in the AXS tokens and that some members of its team might also hold AXS and Axie NFTs.)            The protocol earns revenue by charging a 4.25% fee when players buy and sell Axie NFTs in its marketplace and collecting fees for breeding axies to create new ones. The fees are paid in the form of axie infinity shards (AXS) and smooth love potion (SLP).      While AXS is the governance token, SLP is the uncapped utility token used to breed new axies. ""Each time users breed an axie, SLP is consumed,"" DappRadar noted. Both tokens can be exchanged for fiat or other cryptocurrencies. This is how gamers based in the Philippines, Venezuela and other developing economies have been earning income via the play-to-earn economy.      Per TheTie, the game is helping Philippines-based users to earn $50 per day. That's 66% more than the average wage of $30 per day      “It is impressive how 'hot’ AXS has managed to remain,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, in an email with CoinDesk.      The NFT ecosystem as well as blockchain-based video games could escape harsh regulatory scrutiny because officials are more focused on decentralized finance (DeFi), according to Vinokourov. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Dan Berkovitz said last month the DeFi markets for derivative instruments – meaning futures contracts – may be illegal in the U.S.      The AXS token has a market capitalization of $1.85 billion. The market value of the NFT-gaming segment is $4.78 billion, or just 10% of the market cap of the decentralized finance sector, per data source Messari.      Of course there are ample risks from holding the AXS tokens in a volatile, still-infant industry where new protocols can be prone to technological glitches and subject to attacks. There's also the chance that money may rotate into bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies once bullishness returns to the broader crypto market. At present, the wider market is in stasis with bitcoin locked in the range of $30,000 to $40,000.",POSITIVE,AXS,AXS | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/23/axie-infinity-token-price-doubles-in-2-days,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea4ca47e24f608218b5c6800659c81ef1fe34cb1-1300x808.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376228,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwJptX,1627048915,"Tron, Stuck in Polygon’s Shadow, Deserves Its Own Place in the Sun, Founder Says","Justin Sun isn’t accustomed to being overlooked nor is he happy when he feels that one of his projects isn’t getting enough attention. Sun, who is known for his self-promotion and marketing stunts at least as much for the Tron blockchain network he founded, is rankled because the recent explosive growth on Tron is being overshadowed by better known rival Polygon. So Sun is using his substantial aggrandizement skills to fix that perception.  While statements from one of the most visible and vocal figures in crypto often can suffer from hyperbole, data shows that a few little-known decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on the Tron network have surpassed their better-known counterparts, such as Ethereum-based SushiSwap and Polygon’s QuickSwap by certain metrics.  The achievements did not come overnight, according to Sun, who told CoinDesk that growth on the Tron blockchain has been quite “low-key” compared with others, namely protocol Polygon, a ""layer 2"" product that is built on top of the Ethereum platform.  “We have always been bigger than Polygon, but many in the markets have underestimated us,” Sun said, without specifying the metrics that make Tron “bigger” than Polygon. “After all, Polygon has been a bit more high profile, and we are relatively low-key.”  “Being low-key doesn’t mean we have not been doing well,” Sun added.  If Tron is bigger in some way than Polygon, it’s not in “total value locked.” According to data from DeFi Llamahttps://defillama.com/protocol/polygon, the total value locked in Polygon stands at around $7.73 billion. While the total value locked on Tron is estimated at around $6 billion at the time of publication. (Total value locked refers to the amount secured on a DeFi app.)  A tweet by Sun in March shows that the total value locked on Tron surpassed $8 billion at the time, while growth in Polygon appears to only have started taking off in May and June when its total value locked went as high as above $11 billion from a little more than $1 billion at the end of April.  But Tron is growing faster in other areas. A report by blockchain data analysis site DappRadar titled “JustSwap on Tron Attracts More Users Than QuickSwap” says that in the 30-day period ended on July 19, decentralized exchange (DEX) JustSwap – Tron’s version of Uniswap on Ethereum – gained about 200,000 unique users, an increase of more than 200% compared with a 1% increase in the same time period on QuickSwap, the most popular DEX on Polygon.  Also in the same 30-day period, JustSwap surpassed QuickSwap and Ethereum’s SushiSwap and was behind only Uniswap – the “unbeatable leader” for DEXes – by unique active wallets, according to DappRadar.  Polygon and the DeFi protocols built on the layer 2 product have become more popular in recent months, as traders and Ethereum-based DeFi projects flock to the protocol for cheaper transaction costs and faster block time.  Also known for cheaper and faster transactions than Ethereum, Tron also has gained traction lately with impressive growth in stablecoin: There are more USDT, the most popular stablecoin, on Tron than on Ethereum already and USD coin (USDC), another popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, that also recently started supporting Tron.  But the sudden growth of the DEXes on Tron still got some analysts and market participants scratching their heads because the DeFi sector, in general, has cooled down in the recent months, with Ryan Watkins, an analyst at Messari, saying “That’s odd.” The monthly volume on Ethereum-based DEXes to date in July is well below $50 billion, less than one-third of May’s volume.  Stablecoins and Asia drive Tron’s growth  Sun attributed the importance of stablecoin and Asia’s market in DeFi for fast-paced DeFi growth on Tron.  “The stablecoin ecosystem is the most essential part of all trading in decentralized exchanges,” Sun said. “Without a stablecoin ecosystem, you can’t trade...this is one of our biggest advantages.”  Stablecoins are digital tokens whose values are pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. They are used by traders and others as an intermediary step before putting money in riskier cryptocurrencies. While USDT still dominates the stablecoin market, USDC is among the most popular stablecoins in DeFi. With USDC now also supporting Tron blockchain, it is likely that USDC on Tron can boost the development of DeFi on the blockchain.  According to Circle, the crypto financial services firm that powers USDC, one of the goals of partnering with Tron is “enabling [USDC] growth in Asia and around the globe.”  As a businessman born and raised in China, Sun and his success can be largely attributed to the market in the greater China region: Even today as the crypto crackdown is getting tougher in China, his Weibo account (the equivalent of Twitter in China) remains active as he leads discussions about Tron – whether about DeFi or non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  “Tron has always established a substantial market share in Asia,” Sun said. “Many [crypto] users in Korea, Japan and mainland China are used to protocols on Tron. It’s a known fact that in Asia, the crypto market has been performing quite well.”  DappRadar’s report concluded that if DeFi on Tron can continue growing at its current pace, Tron could soon become a “steady” competitor for Polygon, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and even Ethereum.  But Sun told CoinDesk that he does not view Tron as a potential competitor to blockchains like Binance Smart Chain or Ethereum.  “This is not about who’s taking whose slice of the cake,” he said, using a metaphor about the distribution of the crypto market that’s often used by Chinese. “This is about making this cake bigger altogether...BSC and we are experiencing explosive growth...We can both meet the needs that cannot be satisfied on Ethereum.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/23/tron-stuck-in-polygons-shadow-deserves-its-own-place-in-the-sun-founder-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9368abaff687af14512f90e87b21b0ddb1d5257e-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434896,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuHph,1627048008,What Is Going On With Bitcoin SV?,"Bitcoin satoshi's vision (BSV), one of the most prominent breakaway cryptocurrencies, is reeling from a rough couple of weeks.      First, a series of attacks were executed against the network on June 24 and July 1, 6 and 9. It is unclear whether any users lost money, but the fact that someone managed to double-spend coins rattled market participants.      A few days later, Gravity suspended trading of BSV, citing the disabling of deposits and withdrawals at “several large exchanges,” which the London-based brokerage said forced its liquidity providers to stop making markets in the asset. Since then, BSV trading has resumed on the platform.      On Tuesday, the Binance exchange announced that at the end of the month it will suspend its BSV mining pool, which contributes an estimated 0.044 exahashes per second (EH/s) of processing power to the network, 8.2% of the total. Binance’s withdrawal means the BSV network will have less overall computing power verifying transactions, making attacks even easier to perform.      The series of unfortunate events appears to be weighing heavily on the price of BSV, founded by Craig Wright, the controversial Australian businessman who has long claimed to be Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. BSV is off 73% from its high in May of $461. Over the last 24 hours the coin is up 2.59% at $124.67.      Long before the attacks, at least five other exchanges – Kraken, Okcoin, Coinbase, Binance, Independent Reserve and ShapeShift – had delisted BSV over the last two years, often in response to Wright’s behavior, particularly his lawsuits against his critics.    Read more: Australian Crypto Exchange to Delist BSV Over 'Bullying' Threat to Bitcoin Developers    Undeterred, Wright, chief science officer of a company called nChain, kept the lawsuits coming. In June of this year, he won a copyright case in London against the website Bitcoin.org for posting Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper, which Wright insisted was his work. Wright prevailed in part because the owner of the site, an anonymous user by the name of Cobra, refused to appear in court.    Read more: UK Court Orders Bitcoin.org to Remove White Paper Following Craig Wright Lawsuit    Some exchanges, however, remain supportive of BSV. Bittrex still allows users to swap BSV for fiat, while OKEx and Huobi support trading of BSV with stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies.      The Bitcoin Association for BSV, a Switzerland based non-profit company that supports the development of BSV and BSV-centric startups and enterprises, said it has been actively communicating with exchanges and trying to support “the reinstatement of BSV deposit, withdrawal and facilities as soon as possible.”    What Is BSV?    BSV is a fork, or splinter currency, of Bitcoin Cash (itself a fork of Bitcoin) whose block size is determined by market forces rather than being fixed. During the 2017 bull run, fees for sending transactions on the original Bitcoin network went through the roof and some transactions weren’t processed for days on end. This was due, in part, to Bitcoin’s fee structures, which have transactions compete with each other for block space via bidding fees to the miners.      This is what is referred to as Bitcoin’s “scalability problem.” When use across the network is high, so are the fees. One camp in the Bitcoin community offered a solution. By increasing the block size, miners would be able to fit more transactions into each block, hence lowering fees as well as being able to process more transactions every 10 minutes.      But this solution was roundly resisted, and the debate over block size sparked a civil war in the Bitcoin community. Ultimately, those who wanted to keep the block size limit unchanged prevailed.      So, on Aug. 1, 2017, Bitcoin Cash split as a hard fork of the Bitcoin network with 8-megabyte blocks rather than 1-megabyte blocks. But even among the group that seceded, not everyone agreed with the magnitude of change; a subgroup led by Wright believed BCH's block size still wasn’t large enough. A new hard fork, this time splitting off from Bitcoin Cash, called BSV emerged, which eventually introduced 2,000-megabyte blocks during the Quasar update.      Many free market-minded individuals within the newly seceded BSV community looked at the inherited feature of a block size limit and asked: If Bitcoin has so many free-market characteristics, then why shouldn’t the block size be determined by free-market forces as well? So, the block size limit was removed completely from BSV.    The attacks    During the June and July attacks, a single mining pool, Taal, captured 78% of BSV’s hashrate, well over the 51% threshold needed to take control of a network. But be clear: Taal itself did not attack the network, nor was this the proverbial “51% attack.”      Rather, the block reorganization attack was carried out by an “unknown miner operating under the ‘Zulupool’ moniker,” according to an email from the Bitcoin Association to CoinDesk. Again, to be clear, this miner was an impostor.      Josh Petty, CEO and founder of Twetch.com, told CoinDesk he spoke with the real Zulupool Hathor mining pool and confirmed that the malicious actor was not related to them. “The attacker, who also called themselves ZULUPool, did not put the Hath string or the state of the Hathor chain in the coinbase message, suggesting they are not actually the real ZULUPool, as all of ZULUPool's hashrate comes from Hathor mining across the various Bitcoin-compatible SHA256 chains.” Petty wrote in an email.      “It is more likely [the impostor] made use of a portion of the ~100Eh/s of hashrate that was recently decommissioned in China to attempt a double-spend attack on some lower difficulty chains,"" Petty went on. ""This is only possible because BSV's hashrate currently sits around 0.5-1Eh/s, or 0.5% of the BTC chain, meaning even smaller BTC miners could trivially out-mine TAAL to perform large reorg attacks.”      Such incidents are rare, he said, ""because it is generally far more profitable to simply mine honestly.""      Petty was quick to add that Twetch, a micropayments-based social network running on BSV, was not affected.    The aftermath    The extent of the damage is unclear, according to the Bitcoin Association.      “BSV transactions have been double-spent, but there is no evidence that these fraudulent activities have been carried out to the detriment of another (innocent) party,” the association wrote. “It is possible that the malicious actor has been double-spending their own transactions.”      In other words, no ""victim"" of the double-spends that occurred have come forward, so it's possible the attack sought to simply wreak havoc rather than make a profit.      “No losses have been incurred and nobody has had anything stolen. No attacks have occurred since 9 July 2021,” the Bitcoin Association added.      The association says it has zero tolerance for attacks and has been looking closely into the logistics of this one. “The Bitcoin SV Infrastructure Team have identified one of the addresses connected with the attack (1G47mSr3oANXMafVrR8UC4pzV7FEAzo3r9) as being long associated with ransomware and other attacks on the BTC, BCH and BSV chains,” the nonprofit said.

In particular, a loophole related to reward minting in the yield aggregator, PancakeBunny, was exploited to mint ~7M BUNNY tokens from nothing, leading to a whopping $45M financial loss. After the bloody hack, three forked projects — AutoShark, Merlin Labs, and PancakeHunny — were attacked with similar techniques. Amber Group&apos;s Blockchain Security team, led by Dr. Chiachih Wu, elaborates on the loophole and gives a step-by-step account of the exploit by reproducing the attack against PancakeBunny. Hidden Attack Surface: balanceOf() Many people believe that composability is crucial to the success of DeFi. Token contracts (e.g., ERC20s) play an essential role on the bottom layer of DeFi legos. However, developers may overlook some uncontrollable and unpredictable conditions when integrating ERC20s into their DeFi projects. For example, you can&apos;t predict when and how many tokens you will receive when you retrieve the current token balance. This uncertainty creates a hidden attack surface. In many cases, smart contracts reference the balances of ERC20s in their business logic. For example, when a user deposits some XYZ tokens into the smart contract, XYZ.balanceOf() is invoked to check how much money is received. If you&apos;re familiar with the Uniswap codebase, you probably know that the UniswapV2Pair contract has many balanceOf(...",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ICO | MINING | UNI,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/bsc-flash-loan-attack-pancakebunny/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42434891,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuHjh,1627037302,Bitcoin Options Market Sees Low Chance of Record High This Year,"Bitcoin options are assigning a low probability to prices reaching record highs by the end of the year as volatility expectations continue to fall amid a dour mood in the market.      According to data source Skew, options traders are pricing an 8% chance of the cryptocurrency rising to a new peak above $64,800 by Dec. 31. The probability of bitcoin trading in six figures is just 2%.      Some observers may feel the market is underpricing the probability, but the numbers need to be read in context with the recent price action.      Bitcoin has more than halved since peaking above $64,000 in mid-April. Bullish sentiment has weakened so much that the annualized rolling three-month basis (spot minus futures) in bitcoin futures listed on Binance fell to zero earlier this week. Futures listed on Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, traded at a premium of nearly 40% during the height of the bull run.      The six-month implied volatility, or investors' expectations for price turbulence, has dropped to a more than two-month low of 80% at press time, having peaked at 122% on May 17, Skew data show.      That implies investors expect the price consolidation to continue for a while. The cryptocurrency has mostly traded in the $30,000 to $40,000 range for the past two months, barring occasional dips to $29,000.      Options market probabilities have a positive correlation with implied volatility: The greater the volatility, the higher the odds of bitcoin hitting certain levels.      A word of caution, however. As the name suggests, options probabilities are probabilities and can change quickly along with market conditions.      For example, for the first 10 months of 2020, the market consistently signaled a less than 10% chance of bitcoin jumping above $20,000 by Dec. 31. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency broke above the key level in mid-December and ended the year near $29,000.      At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $32,300.      Options probabilities are calculated using the Black-Scholes formula based on metrics such as call option prices, strike prices, the price of the underlying asset, the ""risk-free"" interest rate on investments as U.S. Treasuries and the time to maturation.      Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to trade the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option represents a right to buy, a put option the right to sell.

Its predecessor, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) allowed for promising projects to raise funds by selling native tokens that would hopefully appreciate in value if the project was successful. STO&apos;s go a step further by allowing people to buy tokenized ownership in assets and projects, oftentimes giving them access to investment vehicles they could not buy outright. This has been heavily leveraged by the property market, with various real estate projects being tokenized and sold. Despite this, there are a few underlying issues within the STO market that need to be addressed, mainly the fragmentation of projects. A Divided Market? STO projects are more common these days and while this means that there are more opportunities to buy into, each comes with their own rules and platforms. Oftentimes, users need to sign up on a specific blockchain-based platform ahead of a sale and then buy a specific digital token that represents ownership in the project. The problem with this is that investors will have to juggle multiple platforms, sets of rules, and token setups in order to buy into investment vehicles. While this worked when the STO sector was first emerging, it must be improved going forward, especially as more people enter the market.

During a webinar on Thursday, Rakiya Mohammed, the bank’s director of information technology, said the pilot will begin Oct. 1, according to someone who took part and asked to remain anonymous because the meeting was private.      The meeting was reported earlier by Nigerian financial news publication Nairametrics. Olumide Adesina, the author of the Nairametrics article, told CoinDesk that according to his sources, Mohammed herself had called the virtual meeting to discuss the initiative.      Last month, Mohammed said the bank had been researching a possible central bank digital currency (CBDC) for years, and would possibly be launching a pilot before the end of the year.      Financial officials in Nigeria have been grappling with how best to deal with the rise of cryptocurrencies in the African nation, which prohibited transactions on cryptocurrencies in the banking sector in February. Edward Adamu, a deputy governor of the CBN, subsequently clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country, and usage is continuing to grow despite the banking restrictions.      A person present at the meeting who asked to remain anonymous so that he could speak freely told CoinDesk that the planned start date for the pilot had always been Oct. 1 and that the digital currency will be built on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.      Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger's executive director, told CoinDesk that there has been an increase in the use of Hyperledger’s open-source blockchain technology, including Hyperledger Fabric, for CBDCs and other currency projects.      “However, since our technologies are all open source, we often don't know all the ways and places Hyperledger software is being used, especially prior to launch,"" Behlendorf said in an email. ""If Nigeria's digital currency project is built on Hyperledger Fabric, that would be welcome news that further validates Fabric as a CBDC platform.”      In June, Mohammed said a digital naira could make remittance transfers easier for Nigerians working abroad. In 2020, Nigeria was one of the top remittance receivers globally. During Thursday’s private meeting, the bank reportedly said a digital currency could improve economic growth, make cross-border transactions easier and give more people access to banking services, according to Nairametrics.      CBDCs, or state-issued digital fiat currency, are often touted as a way to counter privately issued cryptocurrencies that some argue possess the potential to destabilize a nation's sovereignty.

Thorchain also told CoinDesk a hacker deployed a custom contract that was able to trick its Bifrost Protocol into receiving a deposit of fake assets.

Following last week's hack, Thorchain said it had been audited by multiple blockchain security companies to locate bugs in a given network.  ""There were really only two options. Launch and accept the risk of issues, or not launch and stay in the 90% complete audit-review cycle for another six months. Both are difficult,"" Thorchain said.
