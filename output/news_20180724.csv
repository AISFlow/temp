The Foundation explained that PwC Switzerland will act as an external auditor and examine at the organization's finances and operations. This is the first time a ""large-scale blockchain organization [has been] accepted as an audit client"" by a Big Four firm, the Foundation said in a press release.  The release added:  ""The Foundation is committed to operating with the highest degree of integrity in the service of our mission to support the Tezos protocol, ecosystem, and community. Engaging a top-tier independent external auditor ensures that the Tezos community and its observers can trust our operations and use of finances.""  Tezos launched its network for beta testing last month. The blockchain works on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, when transactions are approved by validators. While there are only 26 validators, or ""bakers"" as they are dubbed by Tezos, their number is expected to continue to grow. Eight of the Foundation's own members are currently bakers.  PwC has been active in the blockchain space over the last several years and provides in-house blockchain services for companies seeking to utilize distributed ledger technology. This past November, PwC Hong Kong began accepting payments in cryptocurrency for advisory services, while in March, PwC announced a collaboration with U.S. custody bank Northern Trust, which allowed auditors to access information stored on its private blockchain.  Similarly, PwC announced last week that it would participate, along with fellow Big Four auditing firms Deloitte, EY and KPMG in a trial for a blockchain developed by Taiwan's Financial Information Service Co.

The news comes just hours after the regulator announced it was postponing a decision on five other proposed ETFs. Those funds were proposed by Direxion Investments, which has withdrawn similar proposals in the past at the SEC's direction.  At the same time, there is an effort to encourage the SEC to approve another ETF proposal, offered by VanEck and SolidX.

The company is now looking to expand to more states and other countries, as well as add additional cryptocurrencies and new products. These products could include fixed-income and debt investments, lines of credit and credit cards, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince told Business Insider.

42401694,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd26DU,1532448611,"Ripple Report: XRP Sales Dropped 56% in Q2, But Customer Base Grew","Payments startup Ripple reported a sharp decline in XRP sales in the second quarter of 2018, when compared to the first three months of the year.  The Q2 2018 XRP Markets Report, published Tuesday, explains that the company sold $73.53 million in XRP, compared to the previous quarter's $167.7 million – marking a decrease of 56.15 percent. Similarly, overall market volume also dropped in the second quarter, especially when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018.  Within the $73 million total, however, direct sales from Ripple subsidiary XRP II rose to $16.87 million, up from $16.6 million in the first quarter. Meanwhile, programmatic XRP sales fell from $151.10 million to $56.66 million (down 62.5 percent), and only accounted for roughly 0.125 percent of the global XRP volume.  Ripple still considers the period its ""best quarter ever in Q2,"" at least in terms of the number of customers signed up. The decline in price over the period largely aligns with the overall bear market, it adds.  ""The decline in both volume and price was consistent across the majority of digital assets, as many moved with tight correlation,"" the report states, adding:  ""The tight correlation is indicative of a market that is still in its infancy. Traders have yet to distinguish among the intrinsic values of the best known digital assets. As the industry matures and decides what it deems most useful and valuable, we should expect to see more separation.""  Ripple also addresses the XRP tokens it is holding in escrow, saying 3 billion were released but 2.7 billion were returned into escrow during the quarter.  The company said the fact that Ripple's successful quarter, combined with XRP's price decline, ""underscores XRP's independence from Ripple.""  Ripple, which utilizes the XRP ledger for some of its payment products, notably has been pushing back recently against claims that the cryptocurrency is tied to the company. Chief executive Brad Garlinghouse said last month at a conference that the ledger is not dependent on the company, going so far as to say that XRP is not a security.  Editor's note: An earlier version of this article stated Ripple had sold $75.53 million worth of XRP. Ripple later amended its report, updating the figure to $73.53 million.

42401678,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd264d,1532447405,"Bitcoin's Price Is Nearing $10K On a Single, Troubled Exchange","Cryptocurrency exchange WEX continues to see prices well out of step with the broader market amid a near-total freeze on customer withdrawals.  As CoinDesk reported, customers of WEX – a kind of successor to the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e – have been on tenterhooks since July 12, as they've largely been unable to get outbound payments processed.  The only exceptions have been for the crypto assets tether and zcash (along with lower-volume, lesser-known alternatives like namecoin and novacoin) and the price disparities suggest that some WEX users are utilizing these tokens as a way out. The normally dollar-tied tether, also known as USDT, is currently above $2 and WEX's price for zcash (against the US dollar) is $440, or more than double the prevailing rate on the broader market.  Those looking to convert their money held on WEX to zcash or tether just to get it out of the exchange must pay a steep price, according to one customer.  ""If you buy zcash on WEX, you will have to sell it somewhere else much cheaper, losing up to 50 percent, as the USDT rate is now $2.195 on WEX,"" Grigory, a systems administrator from a town in Russia called Ivanovo, told CoinDesk. Further, the ability to make withdrawals has become unavailable again from time to time, he added.  In the absence of word from WEX staff, users have taken to social media and the exchange's chat box to wonder aloud about the story behind the delay.  Cryptocurrency prices have risen on the site as well, with the value of bitcoin exceeding $9,600 as of press time, or more than $1,400 above the price recorded on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Prior to the withdrawal issues, prices on the exchange had notably spiked above $9,000.  WEX representatives have not responded to multiple requests for comment.  Waiting game  The situation on WEX has been brewing for more than a week, the exchange's own statements show.  On July 12, WEX announced on Twitter that withdrawals of fiat and cryptocurrencies were blocked due to the ""database migration and other maintenance.""  Later that day, it was said that maintenance had been completed, and some coins, including zcash and tether (as well as lower-volume coins like namecoin and peercoin), were available for withdrawal. But larger crypto assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin and dash were to remain unavailable until July 22, according to a post on July 16.  The last public message via Twitter was posted on July 19, saying, ""Maintenance has finished successfully.""  However, when July 23 came, exchange customers kept complaining that withdrawals were still blocked.  ""No Withdraw is working. It is 23rd now. Maintenance fail can happen, but no information is worst. After BTCe now WEX?"" said user @Pete11240362.  ""Administrators, if you can't resolve the problem right now, say: maintenance works in process. Get smart, give some feedback,"" demanded Russian-speaking user Sergey Ionkin, who goes by the handle @dear_enman.  Some of the affected users took to Telegram to discuss the situation. One of the groups was promoted and possibly created by Dmitrii Vasilev, an official owner and CEO of WEX, who previously told CoinDesk that he lost control over the exchange due to the intervention of some people he declined to identify.  On Monday, a user in one of the channels claiming he is Dmitrii Vasilev – using two similar usernames, (Dmitrii Vasiliev and Dmitii wex.nz) – wrote that he had agreed to register the exchange in the name of the new beneficiaries who are already de facto managing WEX.  The user claimed that the deal is going to take place on Thursday, and promised to reveal the names of those beneficiaries if they don't fix the situation on that day. Vasilev stopped answering CoinDesk's inquiries after a brief exchange on July 12.  No easy ways out  According to Grigori, avenues for actually taking money off the exchange exist – but at a price.  Grigory told CoinDesk he has had 0.1 BTC waiting in limbo on WEX since July 12. He said he started using WEX in the end of 2017 because he liked that the exchange didn't require ID verification.  For the most of time everything had worked fine, he explained: he had been able to withdraw coins within an hour or less, and fiat-denominated funds would appear in his e-payment account in several hours after the withdrawal transaction.  But that changed earlier this month, he told CoinDesk. The tech support on WEX has provided no reasonable explanation and only recommended waiting until the maintenance is over, Grigory contended.  Fiat withdrawals were ceased in that period, too, though the ability to withdraw funds via so-called WEX codes remained for a time. Users would generate a special code with their accounts and then exchange those codes for fiat currency on specialized websites, which would sent a corresponding amount of dollars or rubles to users' accounts at Russian payment services like Yandex.Money or Qiwi.  But this is no longer a viable solution, according to Grigory.  ""At some point, the offers to buy WEX codes disappeared from those exchange websites as there were enormous numbers of people who wanted to sell them,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Now people who wanted to quit at any price have already quit, but the exchange rate is still bad.""

42401685,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd26AX,1532444405,Hubble Researcher Focuses on Blockchain for Space Data Processing,"A Hubble Space Telescope (HST) researcher is testing a blockchain network for processing the vast amounts of data produced.  Josh Peek, an associate astronomer with the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), told CoinDesk that the HST, like other space telescopes, requires ""millions upon millions"" of hours of computing power to process data, which can become expensive.  While in the past, researchers ""were only spending a tiny amount of compute time per galaxy"" – resulting in basic results and potentially introducing errors at a detailed level, advances in computer technology have put more computing power in the hands of researchers, and, resultingly, a lot more data too.  Using a decentralized network, Peek hopes, may provide a more efficient use of resources by allowing researchers to tap into a larger network than might be available via a traditional server farm.  He explained:  ""Tens of millions of CPU hours can really run up a bill. NASA and [STScI] use computing centers and that's a way we can go … but there's long latency period where you go through a grant process … and so the idea came up that we could use a distributed network to do this really efficiently, it's 10 times cheaper than standard cloud computing.""  To that end, he is working with blockchain startups AIKON and Hadron to process the research data. Specifically, AIKON provides an interface via which Peek can input the data, after which it is processed and rendered through computers comprising Hadron's blockchain network.  Peek likened the network to the SETI@Home program, which helps researchers attached to the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project similarly crowdsource computing power. In effect, the researcher is doing the same thing, but using a blockchain platform.  ""The idea is, we work through AIKON, [which] works as an intermediary and they provide a simple interface for companies to use, or for research groups like mine,"" he explained.  Hadron is a ""useful"" proof-of-work blockchain, said AIKON co-founder and chief product officer Marc Blinder, that is processing the data Peek provides, with computing time paid for with AIKON's ""CPU"" tokens.  To reduce volatility, the value of a token is pegged to the average cost of computing power charged by cloud hosting services, Blinder told CoinDesk.  While the plan is to ultimately have research groups and other clients purchase CPU tokens to rent computing power, right now clients like Peek are testing the system using a supply of free tokens.  The system simplifies the process of harnessing a distributed network for Peek, he said.  ""I'm not an expert in this stuff and that's the point,"" commented Peek, adding:  ""Nobody over here is going to do really complicated things with cryptocurrency, that's not what we do here. The whole idea is, to some sense, we're not touching cryptocurrency at all. We don't buy anything ... That's what AIKON is trying to do, make this as simple as possible with no cryptocurrency nonsense.""

In the latest edition of the Federal Register, the SEC explains that it is postponing any decision over the possible approval of ETF proposals filed by Direxion Investments in January – one of which will match bitcoin's price and four of which are based on the cryptocurrency's price movements.  The SEC states:  ""The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider this proposed rule change. Accordingly, the Commission, ... designates September 21, 2018, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove the proposed rule change.""

42401693,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd26HQ,1532437258,Meet Honeyminer: The App That Lets You Earn Bitcoin With a Laptop Again,"New mining software promises to let almost anyone earn small amounts of bitcoin with a Windows laptop, giving users a taste of the cryptocurrency's early days.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the New Jersey-based crypto mining startup Honeyminer quietly launched a free beta in June and has already garnered 10,000 downloads across the globe. Honeyminer allows users to participate in a dynamic mining pool by running the app when the computer's graphics processing unit (GPU) isn't in use processing images or videos.  The pool focuses on mining cryptos like ethereum, ethereum classic, zcash, monero and other GPU-friendly currencies. Then, at the end of the session, Honeyminer sends the participant's earnings, converted into bitcoin, directly to the user's wallet.  ""The miner doesn't have to do the math or manage all the configurations and settings, or manually check the prices,"" Honeyminer advisor Noah Jessop, a venture capitalist at Founder Collective in San Francisco, told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""We make it so that any surplus compute, so any laptop you aren't using all the way up to a rig that you run is automatically doing the most profitable computation.""  This type of service offers new opportunities for people who want to acquire bitcoin but have little money to invest or limited access to cryptocurrency exchanges. It could also broaden the range of participants in cryptocurrency mining, which over the years has had its barriers to entry rise as expensive, specialized hardware gave large, professional operations an edge over hobbyists.  Honeyminer's algorithm automatically switches between cryptocurrencies every 10 minutes or so, depending on block size, if there's a sudden change in the currency's mining profitability.  ""We are pooling people together to find those block rewards faster. Together, we have a larger hashrate,"" Honeyminer co-founder Larry Kom told CoinDesk. ""Not only do we connect you to the blockchain and anonymize you through us, but you also are contributing to what is, in essence, a pool.""  To be sure, this isn't the most profitable way to mine cryptocurrency, given broader market volatility compared to bitcoin and Honeyminer's cut, ranging from 2.5 percent to 8 percent depending on the quality of the user's hardware. Someone with a few high-end GPUs could expect to earn bitcoin worth a dollar or two from running the software almost all day.  However, it may be one of the easiest methods to date. Although the company declined to specify how many users are in nations where cryptocurrency access is restricted, such as Jordan or Venezuela, it said more than 18 percent of users hail from developing nations.  ""If you hear about crypto and you want to learn, you can either go out and pay real cash money,"" Jessop said. ""Or you can download a program in 30 seconds and start earning your own crypto, for free.""  Diversified mining  Honeyminer's software was, in part, inspired by the controversies that surround bitcoin mining. Namely, the way many users of the software feel the China-based hardware provider Bitmain has achieved a near-monopoly on mining equipment and how a similar small number of firms control the majority of mining pools.  ""As we've watched in bitcoin proper, the arms race escalates to this custom hardware and then people who have access to the best silicon tabs are the people who control mining,"" Jessop said. ""For us, it's all about increasing the number of people who have access to the best-in-class.""  But according to David Vorick, CEO of Nebulous, which operates Siacoin and the mining equipment manufacturer Obelisk, this may not change the broader ecosystem beyond attracting more curious newcomers. Especially because the software is closed source, albeit with plans to extend open APIs in the future.  ""That actually increases centralization, because all you've done is moved the power from the mining pools or users who have to be advanced, to software toolkits,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Basically all the power lies with the devs of the software.""  Elaborating on this point, Vorick said he believes GPU mining will almost entirely disappear over the next two years regardless. He added:  ""We're going to see general purpose ASICs [mining hardware] come out that is capable of targeting lots of algorithms. As soon as that happens, the role that GPUs play is going to disappear.""  For better or worse, the Honeyminer team recognizes it will need to offer additional features for different types of users.  For newbie retail investors, Honeyminer will soon allow them to send their bitcoin to wallets on third-party platforms like Coinbase. Plus, the app's algorithm can also help miners with professional mining rigs as well.  Whether they're cheap laptops or pro rigs, ""each computer will get a different [task], based on its particular performance or capabilities, you'll get assigned what is most profitable for it,"" Kom said.  A specialized version called Honeyminer Pro is in the works for professional miners who need help with power consumption management and options for manually choosing which cryptos to mine, so they're not restricted to whatever's most profitable, or which coins to cash out in, in case they don't want bitcoin.

According to a report from CoinDesk Korea, the firm revealed its KT Network Blockchain on Tuesday, boasting a throughput of 2,500 transactions per second (TPS) thanks to an integration with its existing high-speed commercial network.  The company further claims it can scale up that figure to 10,000 TPS by the end of the year and even as high as 100,000 TPS by 2019.  With the launch, KT said it is now looking to employ the technology to authenticate users' identities in order to streamline international roaming services. The feature would allow users' information to be securely shared among global partners over a distributed network.  For the first stage of the plan, the telco said it will work with China Mobile and Japanese mobile operator NTT DoCoMo to start exploring the tech in international data roaming within the year.  KT Network Blockchain is also expected to play a role in energy trading in the second half of the year, with corporations participating as nodes to exchange unused energy quotas across the distributed network.

42401699,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd26JO,1532430011,Indicator Suggests Bitcoin's $8K Price Rally Could Be Overstretched,"Bitcoin (BTC) has had a bullish start to the week, but the momentum could wane in the next few days, technical studies indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency rose to a two-month high of $8,130 on Bitfinex today, having witnessed an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout last week.  The 40 percent rally from the seven-month low of $5,755 reached on June 24 has put the bulls back in a commanding position. Hence, further gains could be on the cards, albeit after a brief pause or a price pullback as a key technical indicator is flashing overbought conditions.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $8,100 on Bitfinex.  Daily chart  Notably, the relative strength index (RSI), one of the most widely used momentum indicators, jumped above 70.00 (overbought zone) earlier today and is currently located at 74.56 – its highest level since December.  So, it could be said that bitcoin is at its most overbought level in seven months.  As a result, the cryptocurrency may find it hard to gain a foothold above the immediate resistance of $8,140 (pennant resistance) in the next few days and could see a minor price pullback.  That said, a technical correction, if any, will likely be short-lived as the other tools are biased towards the bulls. For instance, the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a bullish setup.  Meanwhile, the short duration charts are also calling a further price rally.  4-hour chart  The broadening wedge breakout seen on the chart above indicates a continuation of the rally from the July 17 low of $6,740. Accordingly, the attention has now shifted to the significant price obstacle of the 200-day MA, currently located at $8,676.  View  BTC's break above $8,000 has bolstered the already bullish technical setup, however, overbought conditions could cap the upside around $8,150 over the next few days.  A pullback to ascending (bullish) 10-day MA, currently at $7,570 and seen sloping upwards to $7,700 in the next 48 hours, cannot be ruled out but will likely end up refueling the BTC freight train for a sustained move toward the 200-day MA of $8,676.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $7,221 (July 21 low) would abort the bullish view.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The district government of the Jiangbei new area in Nanjing city announced the plan to launch the 10 billion yuan (around $1.4 billion) blockchain fund last Friday.

At least that's the early consensus on FOMO 3D and PoWH3D, two of the platform's top three apps entering Tuesday.  According to data website DappRadar, both games have amassed 20,000 ether ($9 million) in trading volume over the last 24 hours, a figure that puts them on par with top decentralized exchanges and that exceeds the highest highs of CryptoKitties, the blockchain's most famous viral decentralized application (dapp) to date.  Perhaps unique to both projects though is how they create an incentive to bring new people in so users can share the spoils as they do so. Both applications also collapse if new users quit joining in a way that's similar to a basic pyramid scheme.  However, these particular games make it much more complicated (and maybe more fun).  ""At the core, they seem to be taking the ideas of pay-per-bid auction models that were popular in 2009–2011, except instead of selling 'real' products for the bid price, they sell nothing tangible or of real value,"" Sid Kalla, of token project consulting firm Turing Advisory Group, told CoinDesk.

The final winning bidder might get a deal, but the organization running the auction would make many times over the price of the item from the fees collected on the way to that bid.  At least then auctioneers took on some risk: the cost of the item and operational costs. With these games, there's none (except perhaps indictments).  Both projects appear to be by the same group, which calls itself ""TeamJUST."" The creators are keeping themselves anonymous. The two products have sparked a furor among crypto enthusiasts, who are warning buyers not to support what they allege are pyramid schemes.  JP Thor, CEO of CanYa, a startup funded with an initial coin offering (ICO), wrote on Twitter:  ""One thing for certain, this thing won't end well.""  But financial blogger JP Konig was more philosophical, writing on Twitter, ""It is human nature to seek out gambling opportunities like Ponzis. Till now the only option has been shoddily-run offline Ponzis. If ethereum's relatively clean Ponzis displace the bad ones, the world is (a bit) better off.""  As Konig points out, Ponzi schemes are nothing new on the blockchain. Dapp Radar founder Skirmantas Januskas pointed out PoWH 3D on March 31 with a Medium post. ""Let's be honest, this is a pyramid scheme. Every user is getting paid for the users that join later,"" he wrote.  In an email to CoinDesk, one of the anonymous team members of TeamJUST wrote:  ""There's a lot of misconceptions. It's a game of semantics. By some definitions, almost all of cryptocurrency itself, as well as Social Security, have certain properties of a Ponzi.""  But what seems to be developing now is a sense of traction around the projects. While PoWH 3D has been on the blockchain a while, it wasn't till mid-July that it started to really rise on the dapp charts, perhaps helped in part by TeamJUST's followup, Fomo3D.  And it may be that the games' very sketchy nature was part of the charm. Both projects have sites that make light of their approach. In many ways, they strike a similar tone to July 2017's Useless Ethereum Token, the ICO that measured buyer's contributions in the number of big screen televisions its creator could purchase.  He raised about $80,000 or 310 ETH at the time, promising nothing.  PoWH 3D  As the rise of these newer games shows, though, that promise still seems to work.  The ""PoWH"" in PoWH 3D's name stands for ""proof of weak hands.""  Using a token called P3D and a custom decentralized exchange for users to buy it and sell it, the creators added some elaborate features to make a relatively simple and familiar idea more fun on a blockchain. Every time someone transacts, it levies a 10 percent fee. That fee is then distributed to everyone still holding the token.  So, people holding P3D get paid as people come in, and they get paid as people go out.  It also rewards users for creating affiliate links that draw people in, and rewards them for sticking around over time. It calls these functions 'staking' and 'mining.'  As the site puts it: ""Yes, our staking and mining systems are comedic jabs at cryptocurrency as a whole, they're also immensely more fun, and reward in (ETH) instead of something that 'may' have value later.""  And its creators argue that you can't call it a scheme if it's upfront about how everything works:  ""We recognize that a trustless smart-contract managing value in this way simply was not possible before this point in computing history. There's no scheming here at all – it's upfront, honest and completely transparent.""  Fomo3D  Fomo3D, which launched on July 8, is another TeamJUST game that recalls ""The Button,"" an experiment that ran on Reddit in 2015, which itself evoked penny auctions (without any money on the line).  In the Reddit game, a simple button was accompanied by a 60-second timer. When a user clicked the button, the timer would reset. If no one clicked it, the timer would run out and the game would end. It took two months and over 1 million clicks before someone let the timer run out.  Fomo3D works in a similar way, except pushing the metaphorical button costs a little money. There are now over 21,400 ether (nearly $10 million) on the line at the time of writing. Users of the game buy a ""key,"" and each purchase sets the countdown (currently at around 24 hours) back by a certain amount.  As the game's wiki explains, ""Players receive a stream of passive income from the game as keys are bought during the round. These rewards can be withdrawn anytime.""  To massively simplify how this very weird game ends, fundamentally: when the countdown runs out, the smart contract ""drains,"" or pays out. Winners depend on which ""team"" a person joins and — to make it weirder still — part of the winnings can even go to holders PoWH 3D's token.  In that way, it's helping convince users in its first game to stay in. And it seems to be working: Fomo3D has far more transactions over the last day so far than its predecessor.  Fomo3D consciously evokes the seedier corners of the cryptocurrency industry. The username of the last player to buy a key is splashed across the site with the warning that they're ""exit scamming,"" the practice of taking investors' funds through an ICO and making off with the money rather than building whatever product was promised.  Scam or be scammed  Creativity and humor aside, most think the change in tone isn't enough to brush aside concerns.  ""I think it appeals to people as a way to gamble with some 'exciting' rules of the game,"" Kalla said. ""Given some of the time frames on which this operates, it wouldn't be surprising to see this run for a while before losing steam.""  For some critics, the cheeky references to scams are a bit too on-the-nose. The most upvoted comment on one Reddit thread about FoMo3D – ""my wife still doesn't believe in mee"" – is a reference to the most notorious (recent) crypto Ponzi scheme, BitConnect.  The joke may be on the players though. Péter Szilágyi, one of ethereum's more well-known developers, took the time to detail an attack that could potentially undermine one of the schemes on Reddit this week. Which raises the question: if the stakes behind a game designed to rob its players gets stolen, did the thief really do anything wrong?  The answer may be one that the dapps' users are soon to find out.  UPDATE (24, July 2018 14:08 UTC): CoinDesk added comment from TeamJUST subsequent to publication.

According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped by $200 in just two hours on Wednesday and is changing hands at $8,015 as of press time – that's a level not seen since May 24.  The price of bitcoin had been declining since May 24 and reached a new year's low at $5,785 on June 24, after which it started regaining momentum for a move back above $8,000, reflecting a nearly 40 percent increase since the June low.  Data from Bitfinex shows the trading volume of bitcoin more than doubled amid the price move, having increased from $4.9 million to $12.6 million within just four hours on the exchange.  That said, bitcoin is still down nearly 53 percent from the yearly high above $17,000 seen in January.  Meanwhile, data shows that bitcoin's market capitalization dominance has also increased significantly over the past two months.  According to CoinMarketCap, bitcoin accounted for 37 percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization in mid-May. Yet that data has increased to 47 percent as of press time, pushing bitcoin's dominance to a level not seen since late December.  Notably, bitcoin is the only top 10 cryptocurrency by market cap that has seen growth over the past 24 hours, with other major cryptos all seeing declines of 1–5 percent, respectively.

42401692,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd26FS,1532404851,A New Bitcoin Wallet Fulfills an Old Privacy Promise,"""From here on out, people can't say bitcoin is not private anymore.""  That's how veteran developer Adam Ficsor, now CTO and co-founder of the privacy tech startup zkSNACKs, described the importance of the Wasabi Wallet, set to debut on August 1.  This desktop-friendly bitcoin wallet, which can only be used with the anonymizing Tor browser, will be the first (relatively) mainstream light wallet to offer CoinJoin transactions, dispatching lots of transactions at once to obscure their sources.  First proposed by Bitcoin Core legend Gregory Maxwell in 2013, CoinJoin is one of the most prominent attempts to solve one of bitcoin's greatest challenges: while addresses are pseudonymous, all transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, undermining user privacy.  While developers have been experimenting for years with improved anonymity models, Wasabi Wallet will finally make using CoinJoin as easy as flipping a switch.  Because these privacy tech projects generally avoid collecting data about their users for obvious reasons, it's hard to determine how many people use privacy-oriented wallets. However, Samourai Wallet's Android app, arguably the bitcoin industry's leading privacy wallet since the project was founded in 2015, has garnered at least 27,000 downloads.  The team behind Samourai also plans to implement a type of CoinJoin feature by the end of the year, called a Whirlpool cycle. So Ficsor added another unique feature to further distinguish Wasabi Wallet.  Most bitcoin wallets actually have thousands of addresses inside, he said. But blockchain explorers like Blockchain.info can often detect that those unique addresses share a common source since the same wallet will send an explorer balance queries on all its addresses simultaneously, tipping the user's hand that they belong to the same person.  ""That's what we want to avoid,"" Ficsor said. To do so, he applied a so-called filtering solution first proposed by the bitcoin developer known as Roasbeef, which Ficsor said enables the wallet ""to query how much money is in your wallet in a way that you don't connect your addresses together.""  With the filter, instead of pinging an explorer, ""you can figure out which blocks in the blockchain you are interested in and you connect to a lot of bitcoin nodes and get one block from one node,"" Ficsor said. ""So basically they cannot figure out which transaction you are interested in and they cannot make statistical guesses what this random guy who asks for a block from me wants to do with that block.""  Although funds are otherwise viewable on the blockchain itself, Wasabi will be the only wallet that obscures from nodes how much bitcoin the total wallet holds. ""No [other] light wallet queries the balance in a private way,"" he said.  Shared values  Beyond the Japanese motifs, the Samourai and Wasabi projects have a lot in common, both in terms of values and business models.  The most obvious commonality is the privacy focus. Speaking to why he's so passionate about privacy, Ficsor said it's critical to the success of a currency that any individual unit is as valuable any other, no matter where it's been, telling CoinDesk:  ""Fungibility is very closely related to privacy and anonymity. And we know this is a property of money, that this is a feature it needs.""  Likewise, the pseudonymous co-founder of Samourai Wallet, who goes by the initials SW, told CoinDesk his team views know-your-customer identity checks that connect bitcoin wallets to users' government-issued IDs or bank accounts, such as those implemented by platforms like Coinbase, as a ""fundamental attack on bitcoin and its users.""  These ideals have in turn shaped the two teams' business models. They've both eschewed taking venture capital or raising money through an initial coin offering (ICO), two of the most popular fundraising methods for blockchain projects.  ""My co-founder and I come from very well-funded, by VCs, companies in the crypto space. And that's not something we wanted to replicate,"" SW said, adding that ICOs are ""a good way to distract yourself from building a good product.""  Rather, both Ficsor's recently founded zkSNACKs startup, incorporated in Gibraltar, and the un-incorporated Samourai Wallet project were self-funded until launch then accepted bitcoin donations to expand the team to roughly five people each.  SW pays contractors only in bitcoin, while Ficsor utilized two donated bitcoin to compensate independent developers.  Ficsor said self-funding allowed him to stay independent. In fact, Ficsor is so confident users want Wasabi's CoinJoin feature that charging 0.3 percent per mixer transaction is the startup's sole source of revenue. He told CoinDesk:  ""We're actually expecting to have a lot of income, so we're not selling out.""  Meanwhile, economist Bálint Harmat, co-CEO of zkSNACKs, agreed with SW about prioritizing the product instead of trying to make a quick profit or generate buzz.  ""At first we want to make sure that the wallet is rock-solid,"" Harmat told CoinDesk. ""We are planning to release the 1.0 version on October 31, without outside investors. We are only going to accept investors' money for further development of Wasabi if it is stable and we enjoy the acknowledgment of the bitcoin community.""  Co-opetition  Given the similarities between Wasabi and Samourai, it's not surprising that the two have collaborated.  Both privacy wallets will implement ZeroLink, an open source tool Ficsor made to help developers find a wallet's security vulnerabilities. By working with the Samourai Wallet team on such tools, Ficsor prioritized the open source ethos over any rivalries with a formidable competitor. Taking the idea even further, both teams plan to make almost all of their software open source.  Nevertheless, they are still competitors. Evincing the rivalry, SW critiqued Wasabi's CoinJoin feature for requiring users to wait until 100 users pooled their bitcoin together to send out at once.  ""How long is that going to take?"" SW asked.  These privacy wallets share at least one more thing in common: they are out of step with the trend among VC-funded blockchain startups to become more like regulated financial institutions.  Aside from recently seeking broker-dealer or even banking licenses, the industry's unicorns are known for tracking their users' transactions on the blockchain in order to comply with anti-money-laundering (AML) laws and international sanctions. Indeed, platforms like Coinbase often freeze accounts that accept cryptocurrency previously used on a gambling site or dark market.  That's why around 15 percent of Samourai users utilize the Ricochet option, which adds five additional hops to a transaction until it lands at the intended destination. Wasabi's CoinJoin feature will offer similar, although not identical, obfuscation.  On the other hand, Samourai already has many other unique privacy features, including a stealth mode that hides the application so that anyone stealing the phone won't know it holds a bitcoin wallet. Plus, Samourai Wallet offers remote commands to wipe a stolen phone clean and transfer the wallet to another device.  Such privacy features have proven especially useful for bitcoin users in Venezuela, where corrupt officials are known to confiscate crypto-related devices.  Venezuelan Samourai Wallet user Eduardo Gomez, head of support at the crypto startup Purse who earns his salary in bitcoin, told CoinDesk he uses features like Ricochet and CoinJoin because he fears platforms like Coinbase could freeze his account if he receives a bitcoin with a questionable transaction history.  ""I have no control over which bitcoin my employers send me,"" he told CoinDesk, concluding:  ""I really want to emphasize how important fungibility is for bitcoin. The community needs to solve that problem ASAP.""
