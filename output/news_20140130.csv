42376852,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6er9B,1391125333,Winklevosses to Submit Revised Bitcoin ETF to SEC,"Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are likely to submit a revised plan for their proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within the next two weeks, the brothers' lawyer Kathleen H. Moriarty told Bloomberg on 30th January.      The first proposal for Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust was filed last July. Since then Moriarty says she's been ""in dialogue"" with regulators about altering the plan.      The ETF has been styled as a way for the Winklevoss to convince more mainstream investors to enter the bitcoin market, without directly exposing their money to the sometimes volatile currency.    ""The Shares are designed for investors seeking a cost-effective and convenient means to gain exposure to Bitcoins with minimal credit risk,"" the original S-1 filing states.    Moriarty is realistic about the proposal given the current regulatory challenges, even with the planned revisions. She told Bloomberg that she believes it is progressing nicely and could be approved by the end of 2014.      Notably, the comments corroborate an earlier January report by Seeking Alpha that suggested that the SEC had ""been receptive"" to the ETF and that its prospects ""looked good"".    Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust    Despite the legal challenges the Winklevosses face, SecondMarket has already succeeded at launching a bitcoin ETF known as the Bitcoin Investment Trust. One notable difference between the two funds, is that SecondMarket's offering is only open to high-income, institutional investors.      The original proposal for the Winklevoss ETF called for it to be traded publicly and open to general investors. Subsequent reports suggested that SecondMarket was able to bypass many regulatory hurdles by pursuing this demographic, and that even ETFs that deal in established commodities can face difficulties making it to a wider market.      Further, SecondMarket, in public comments, seemed to back this belief:      ""From a risk-profile vantage point bitcoin is very risky and we think it’s not appropriate for retail investors,"" Mark Murphy, a spokesman for SecondMarket, told Quartz in September.            Winklevosses wary of regulation    [post-quote]      The news comes two days after the Winklevoss brothers were part of the most anticipated panel of this week's New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) hearings.      At the event, Cameron Winklevoss appealed to regulators for a ""middle ground"", but cautioned that too much regulation would inhibit investors from entering the virtual currency space.      The comments were echoed by other major investors who suggested that, despite setbacks like the recent Charlie Shrem arrest and Silk Road shutdown, current regulation is working.      However, this viewpoint might not best serve the Winklevoss and their ETF.      The lack of regulation or guidance on virtual currencies could be a contributing factor to the SEC's reluctance to approve it.

42376866,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erOH,1391121175,"Dogecoin Raises $7k for Indian Olympians, But Hurdles Remain","Reddit's dogecoin community continued its impressive run of charitable giving on 29th January when it raised 4.2m dogecoin, roughly $7,000 at press time, to help India's underfunded winter Olympians raise money for the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia.      A donation address was launched Thursday in response to an article in The Washington Post that chronicled the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) suspension of the Indian Olympic Association, and what this action would mean for three Olympic hopefuls set to compete in the games.      The piece focused on charismatic Indian luger Shiva Keshavan, who for years has financed his training with donations, built luges in his garage and practiced on India's roadways because the country has no official luge track.      The article brought awareness to Keshavan, as well as alpine skier Himanshu Thakur and cross-country skier Nadeem Iqbal, the latter of which were said to be struggling to gain financial support needed for the games. Keshavan, the story said, had already secured his funds.      As of press time, the donation address had received 475 donations, the largest of which was a single donation of 3m dogecoin, or about $4,500. However, how the funding will make it into the hands of the Olympic hopefuls remains unclear.    Hurdles remain    Even after an impressive round of donations, exactly who the funding will benefit is uncertain, according to Ben Doernberg of the Dogecoin Foundation. Doernberg said he's been in touch with Keshavan's wife, as well as the secretary general of the Winter Games Federation of India via email about the developing matter.      Doernberg's sources indicated that the two skiers had received funding for their trip, but that Keshavan had not. However, it is still waiting for confirmation on the final total needed and whom the proceeds will go to.      ""We're basically holding onto the money in dogecoin form until we can figure out which athletes definitely need the money and how we can get it to them in a way that won't get tied up in a bureaucratic process that's going to take weeks,"" Doernberg said.              Doernberg said the group is even considering enlisting the help of the Jamaican bobsled team in facilitating the transfer in person at the games - the group recently donated $30,000 worth of dogecoins to help secure its visit to the Sochi games.      To those who made donations, Doernberg says his organization will hold the funds until it's confirmed that they can be directed to the right sources, though he admitted communication with the athletes, all of whom live in remote areas, has been a problem.    Could the Olympians fly dogecoin's flag?    The India Olympic Committe was suspended in December 2012 by the IOC for electing Lalit Bhanot as its secretary general. Bhanot had pending criminal charges and had earlier spent 10 months in jail following corruption charges stemming from his supervision of the Commonwealth Games in 2010.      After the organization failed to come back into compliance with the IOC's policies, the three Olympians were barred from carrying the Indian flag, bearing their country's colors or hearing their national anthem at the event. India's Olympic Association agreed to hold new elections, but scheduled the vote for 9th February, after the games open.      “It’s quite sad. Rather than showcasing our country, it will be a shameful moment in the history of our country’s sport,"" Keshavan told the Post.              If this action sounds surprising, the India Olympic Association's interim president Vijay Kumar Malhotra hasn't exactly been supportive of the athletes either in statements to the press:      “Yes, it is sad that this is the first time ever that the Indian contingent will not be carrying the national flag during the Winter Olympics. However, the Indian Winter Olympics athletes don’t stand a chance of winning any medals, either,” Malhotra said.            Members of dogecoin reddit forums went so far as to suggest that the Olympians fly dogecoin's flag instead, however, questions remained about whether this would be allowed under IOC rules.  Dogecoin to the rescue    While the Olympic projects sprang forth organically from the dogecoin community, Doernberg said the Dogecoin Foundation has bigger projects in store for February.      ""We're going to be doing a fundraiser more for people who are in serious need. The Olympic project is great, and you know, in keeping with the fun and zany attitude of the coin, but we're also looking to do more serious charity projects.""              As for this project, Doernberg said that he's confident in the messages he's received from Keshavan's wife and Winter Games Federation of India and that any concerns of fraud are unwarranted.      He said he is optimistic the Dogecoin Foundation will be able to find a way to get the funds to the Indian Olympians, regardless of which athlete needs the added support.

42376857,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erAR,1391107186,Visa CEO Doesn't See Bitcoin As Business Threat,"Visa CEO Charlie Scharf offered his opinion of bitcoin and other emerging virtual currencies on 30th January in a conference call discussing Visa’s first-quarter fiscal earnings.      “There are certainly some interesting things about bitcoin and other things like it, but there are also a great deal of complexities,” Scharf said      The 48-year-old payment company head went on to state that more traditional payments systems are safer for consumers as they have “established network rules” and an “understanding of how things operate”.      Perhaps most notably, Scharf suggested that Visa is not actively monitoring the bitcoin space.      “We feel quite comfortable with the business we have here,” Scarf said.              Scarf further said Visa and more traditional payments companies better understand who the participants in transactions are, and are in a better position to serve the market as they work with financial institutions on “either side of the transaction”.    Bitcoin’s potential for payments    Operating in more than 200 countries, Visa boasts a network of “tens of millions” of merchant outlets and roughly 2 million ATMs as of 30th December 2013, making it one of the largest global payment providers.      Like bitcoin, the 50-year-old company facilitates that transfer of value and information to consumers. As such, major investors have suggested that Visa is the kind of company that is threatened by the emergence of bitcoin.      Chris Dixon, a partner at Menlo Park, Calif.-based venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote a blog post on 31st December where he expressed his dismay at the high fees charged by the traditional payments industry, as well as the “huge headaches” they caused startups, and explained why he feels bitcoin is the solution.      ""At some point, I had an 'aha!' moment and realized that Bitcoin was best understood as a new software protocol through which you could rebuild the payments industry in ways that are better and cheaper,"" Dixon wrote.              Computer science professor at Princeton University Ed Felten expressed a similar sentiment at the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) bitcoin hearings in New York, stating that there is a need for currencies that are ""born digital"" to modernize payments.    Impact    The comments notably come just one day after members of the bitcoin business community such as Jeremy Allaire, founder and CEO of Circle, and Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, called for regulators to help them seek out more traditional financial partners while noting that such partnerships may be challenging to forge.      “That core innovation that allows for transfer of ownership without the need for a trusted third party, that cuts out middlemen,” Ehrsam said.              Scharf's statements also position Visa as disinterested in bitcoin at a time when other players are looking to educate themselves on the marketplace.      On 28th January, San Francisco-based banking and financial services company Wells Fargo held a summit in New York on virtual currencies. The development led Allaire to state that relations between banks and bitcoin businesses are currently experiencing a ""thawing"" process between the two camps.    However, with the comments, Visa, it seems, will not be open to holding a similar event.

42376864,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erLl,1391102336,What Will Chinese New Year Mean for Bitcoin?,"The Year of the Horse is almost upon us!  In Japan it began on 1st January, but now all eyes are turning to China, which begins the new year as influential and unpredictable as ever. Will tomorrow's date have any influence on bitcoin's value? If so, why?  In clamping down on bitcoin exchanges last December, the People's Bank of China set the first day of Chinese New Year (officially 31st January) as the deadline for bitcoin exchanges to completely sever ties with third-party payment processors.  Payment companies were given a verbal warning during a meeting with People's Bank officials in the week of 16th December. Deposit access was shut off almost immediately, with PayPal and Chinese competitors Alipay and TenPay confirming they would comply.  Companies were given until the end of January, however, to clear out any outstanding funds they held for customers to withdraw bitcoins and convert them back into local currency.  It has been reported that all payment processor balances were cleared as of Monday 27th January, giving traders and exchanges plenty of time to adjust before the deadline. Exchanges now use various other methods to move money in and out of their systems, ranging from the use of corporate and personal bank accounts for transfers, to an indirect electronic 'voucher' system.  If the Chinese New Year sees any additional government moves enforcing restrictions on bitcoin, the world could possibly see a value plunge. People involved in the local industry, however, seem unconcerned.  Exchanges, analysts not worried  Leon Li, CEO of official market leader Huobi, said the company could do something to deal with a new regulatory environment, adding that ""there is a lot of misunderstanding of Chinese government policy about bitcoin.""  Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China, said the exchange would be able to continue processing withdrawals even after the deadline via its banking relationships. He said:  ""It's going to be a smooth transition. Account balances have been cleared to zero as of last weekend and it won't won't affect prices that much.""  Jack Wang, a Chinese cryptocurrency developer and entrepreneur, has previously analyzed the People's Bank statements for CoinDesk and tweeted that he does not predict any major price surprise.    Not expecting a post CNY Bitcoin dump. News already priced in, and every exchange I've talked to plans to continue operating.      — jackwang (@jackwang) January 25, 2014    Zennon Kapron, of Shanghai-based consultancy Kapronasia, said the exchanges had shown themselves to be adaptable and that any price movement would likely come from those unfamiliar with China.  ""Yes, the payment processors will be out, but they were pretty much out right after the announcement in December anyway, and they (the exchanges) pretty quickly found alternative methods of funding,"" he said.  ""I don't think it will really have any affect on the prices in China from my understanding - although if people are worried that it will be completely cut off or don't understand the current situation, I suppose there might be a dip.""  Meanwhile, in Hong Kong  By contrast, on the laissez-faire streets of Hong Kong, government action did not even register on the radar, as local exchange AsiaNexgen (ANXBTC) celebrated the new year with a bitcoin giveaway.  Lucky residents received HK$500,000 (roughly $65,000) in bitcoin vouchers in what the exchange claimed was the biggest giveaway of the currency to date.  Miniskirted girls  handed out bitcoin paper wallets to passersby, in the form of traditional red envelopes of cash given as new year gifts to family and colleagues.  In locations across the region, the company handed out 50,000 coupons inside the envelopes (known in Mandarin as 'hongbao') which were embossed with the Chinese character for 'luck' in gold.  ""We're trying hard to promote bitcoins to the wider Hong Kong community, most of whom do not have bitcoin wallets. This was the easiest way to provide instant access to bitcoins without any complications and minimum confusion,"" a company representative stated on reddit.

42376850,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6er5P,1391096809,Fred Wilson: Freedom and Innovation are Two Sides of the Same Coin,"Fred Wilson is a VC and principal of Union Square Ventures. USV invests in bitcoin companies, but not the currency itself. Fred is interested in bitcoin because he believes it can be and possibly will be the financial and transactional protocol for the global Internet.  I testified on Monday in a public hearing on Bitcoin as part of two days of hearings put on by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The hearings were livestreamed here and you can click on the archives and watch all of the panels.  I got pretty animated during the discussion, which is probably not a great thing to do when testifying in a government hearing. But this kind of thing is really important to me. We were talking about the freedom to innovate in an emerging market that is going to get regulated. I don't have a problem with regulation per se, but how and when it happens matters a lot.  As our panel was winding down, Superintendant Lawsky asked what countries were doing it right. I didn't answer that question but instead decided to talk about one that isn't doing it right and brought up China and noted that a fantastic investment strategy would be to have invested in every Internet servcies that China has blocked. My point being that the services China likes to block are the really important ones that have been built on the Internet.  I then noted that this discussion is really about freedom. Chris McAlary recorded my assertion in this tweet:  “It’s about freedom,ultimately,and whether you want to live in a society that embraces innovation,free speech & freedom or not”@fredwilson— Chris McAlary (@KlausTeuber) January 28, 2014    Some will say that I was being overly dramatic or romantic with that line. But I really believe it. If you look at the countries around the world where the most innovation happens, you will see a very high, I would argue a direct, correlation between innovation and freedom. They are two sides of the same coin.

42376863,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erGj,1391092750,Lamborghini and McLaren Dealerships Drive Bitcoin Adoption in USA,"If buying a few drinks or gadgets with your bitcoin stash doesn't get your heart racing, a Los Angeles-based car dealer will be happy to exchange your coins for a motor – and not just any motor at that.  Bitcoin classifieds site Eggify has struck a deal with McLaren and Lamborghini dealerships in California to offer a number of exotic vehicles for petrol heads through its platform. Of course, these aren't everyday cars so they're not exactly designed for shopping outings or family trips to the beach.  Fast payments, fast cars  The first dealership, McLaren Newport Beach, claims to have the largest selection of McLaren MP4-12Cs on the West Coast – and a few Spider models, too. Needless to say, they don't come cheap.  The 12C spider is powered by an eight-cylinder, 3.8-litre twin turbo engine and features a number of pricey extras, like carbon ceramic breaks, a lightweight carbon fibre engine cover and plenty of high-tech goodies. The list price clocks in at 387.40 BTC, but you can try haggling.  If that's a bit too steep, you might want to check out a 2014 Lamborghini Gallardo LP 550-2 Spyder. It packs a 5.4 litre V10 engine and comes with plenty of extras, all for the bargain price of 310 BTC.  Back to the Future fans might want to grab a 1981 DeLorean DMC-12 which is also available on Eggify for 24 BTC.  If you can get hold of Doc Brown's flux capacitor, you could even travel back in time to mine a few bitcoins back in 2010 – which would be much easier than betting on a bunch of football games.  Four-wheel drive  'Outdoorsy' types may be interested that another car dealership, Land Rover of Redwood City, began accepting bitcoin payments via BitPay just yesterday. The dealership chose to accept bitcoins after it was approached by a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who wanted to buy a vehicle using the currency.  Doug Doyle, the dealership's general sales manager, said:  “Realizing we need to be ready to accept change in this constantly broadening virtual community, we agreed to our first bitcoin sale.”  He added: “Although the concept of bitcoin is hard to grasp, the process as put forth by BitPay is quite simple. Just send an invoice and the money shows up in your account. Simple and seamless, just as they said.”  The company has dealerships in California and Florida. In addition to brand new Land Rovers and Range Rovers, it also offers a choice of used vehicles.  Moving up a gear  This is not the first time a car dealership has chosen to accept the fledgling currency.  Last year, Lamborghini Newport Beach promised to accept bitcoins, but it later emerged that the dealership required buyers to convert their bitcoins into dollars – which doesn't exactly qualify as a bitcoin deal. Now, however, it is offering its vehicles through Eggify.  Meanwhile, in Florida it is possible to charge electric cars for bitcoins, using Coinbase. Additionally, last December, UK car classifieds site Auto4You began allowing sellers to list their cars in bitcoin instead of pounds.

42376867,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erPX,1391088728,BTC China Accepting Bank Deposits Again,"Prominent Chinese bitcoin exchange BTC China is now accepting customer deposits via its corporate bank account, plus offering small prizes to its customers.  Bobby Lee, CEO of the exchange, confirmed that customers can now buy bitcoins from the exchange by depositing their funds directly into the company's account.  ""Previously, we judged doing this as not being viable, however, we have since changed our stance. We looked again at the guidance issued in December and we think it's a reasonable for us to accept customer deposits via our corporate bank account,"" said Lee.  He went on to say BTC China now believes the main message in the memo issued by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on 5th December was that banks in the country aren't allowed to set up or become a bitcoin business.  The memo stated that people in China are permitted to buy and sell bitcoins and stressed that that bitcoin exchanges should register with the Ministry of Industry and Technology (MIIT). Lee said:  ""The fact the PBOC said exchanges need to register with MIIT essentially means it recognises exchanges as a business category and BTC China as a legitimate business.""  He explained there's the potential the central bank and/or the Chinese government could ""change the rules of the game"", enforcing stricter policies, but for now he is confident his company is not doing anything wrong.  BTC China has not experienced an upturn in trading volume since the company reinstated direct deposits, this could be because the move has not been publicised, but Lee puts it down to other factors.  ""Volumes in China have been down since December. A lot of the people we have spoken to have stopped trading, they've cashed out, so activity has calmed down a lot. Volume is certainly going to be low for the next few days because we're going through a Chinese New year period,"" he explained.  Lee said BTC China decided to take advantage of the current lull in interest in order to make sure the new deposit procedure runs smoothly.  $165 promotion  BTC China has also launched a promotion to bring awareness to its Maker-Taker programme and reward its customers.  Maker-Taker is a system whereby those posting multiple buy/sell offers and increase liquidity in the market (“makers”) are paid a fee, whereas those who take the offers and remove market liquidity (the “takers”) are charged a fee of 0.3%.  Until 15th February, company is giving 1,000 RMB ($165) to one maker and one taker every time the amount rebated to makers exceeds 100,000 RMB.  ""The prizes go to the maker and the taker who push the rebate threshold over the next 100,000 mark. We have already given out over 3m RMB in rebates and given prizes to 62 winners,"" Lee explained.  He went on to say BTC China's domestic competitors charge 0% commission, but he believes Maker-Taker is a more compelling deal. Lee said:  ""Obviously if you're a taker, to go and buy and sell bitcoin actively, you have to pay a small commission, however, the reason you pay for that is access to the liquidity and the depth of our order book.""  Because of this model and the depth of the order book, BTC China states customers can easily buy and sell tens of thousands of bitcoins without moving the market.  ""We're not trying to be different for the sake of being different. We're trying to be innovative and benefit bitcoin in China. The Maker-Taker method accomplishes two things – it brings more market depth and more liquidity to the site, plus it reduces volatility, which makes for a healthier for market for bitcoin in China,"" Lee concluded.  What do you make of BTC's new promotion and the Maker-Taker model in general?

42422935,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymph,1391080535,Legal Online Gambling is Next Major Bitcoin Market,"The international online gambling industry is an estimated $30bn market, and growing. More importantly for Bitcoin, it's a global market that depends on fast, irreversible payments.  Just like a ordinary casino chip in any land-based casino, digital bitcoin provides privacy, immediacy, and payment finality. Unlike most typical consumer purchases (where returns and chargebacks are usually legitimate), a wager is a one-way transaction. Of course, you may be dissatisfied with the outcome, but that does not justify a reimbursement. The online gambling industry has struggled with this fact for years.  Plagued by chargebacks and fraudulent transactions, specialized payment methods and payment companies have sprouted up around the online casino world to address the problem of payment finality.  iGaming and bitcoin  For the first time ever, the world's largest and most comprehensive trade event in gaming, ICE Totally Gaming 2014, will feature a half-day seminar on bitcoin in the iGaming environment on 4h February. The London-based conference represents every gambling sector: betting, bingo, casino, lottery, mobile, online, and social gaming.  Organized by Gran Via's Willem van Oort, the seminar features two extraordinary panels: 'Regulatory Aspects' and 'Bitcoin's Competitive Edge'. I will also be speaking on the evolution and future of bitcoin as a new monetary unit.  Moderated by iGaming attorney David Gzesh, the regulatory panel will assess the compliance challenges in dealing with bitcoin payment processing applications, including currency conversion, reduced transaction costs, payment finality, Know Your Customer rules, and coin management techniques.  Panelists include; Stuart Hoegner, managing director at Gaming Counsel PC; Steve Beauregard, CEO and founder of GoCoin; and Michael Ellen, director of licensing and strategy at Alderney Gambling Control Commission.  The second panel of the day focuses on the competitive advantages offered by bitcoin in the iGaming industry and will explore potential for new games, new jurisdictional regions, and unique investment opportunities on the horizon.  Stellar panelists include; Esteban van Goor, indirect tax lawyer at PwC; Ivan Montik, CEO and founder of Softswiss; Erik Voorhees, founder of SatoshiDice; Brock Pierce, managing director at Clearstone Global Gaming Fund; Jiten Melwani, founder of Bitgame Labs; and Gabriel Sukenik, director at Coinapult.  Into the mainstream  We are now witnessing the long-awaited arrival of mainstream online casinos and betting establishments into the bitcoin universe. This is the beginning of the second-generation bitcoin gambling sites – the first generation exemplified by sites like SatoshiDice, BitZino, and Seals With Clubs.  CoinDesk reported on Wednesday that Malta-registered casino Vera&John has become the first of the major licensed and regulated online casinos to accept bitcoin deposits. The gaming operator accepts inbound customer payments which are then processed and converted into euros via Panama-based Coinapult service.  Following a trend common among existing online poker sites like WinPoker, Vera&John will only permit wagering in national currency units. The strategy of utilizing bitcoin only as a customer payment transfer mechanism eliminates the exchange rate risk for the operator and the player.  Alternatively, if the player uses bitcoin for deposit, betting, and withdrawal, then the exchange rate risk stays with the player. Examples of that approach include CloudBet and CoinBet.  Sports betting site Cloudbet claims to have revolutionized the online betting experience by introducing the world's most advanced bitcoin betting platform accessible from desktop and mobile devices. Users can browse an intuitive, elegant site to place immediate and discreet bets on any world event – at zero fees.  CloudBet currently deploys 100% offline cold storage for all bitcoin assets and the site has received excellent reviews.  In addition, Costa Rica-registered CoinBet offers casino gaming, poker, and sports betting all under a simple email registration with password. CoinBet claims to be the first legitimate, licensed entity to re-enter the real money online gambling space since Full Tilt Poker, PokerStars, and Absolute Poker all had their sites shut down by the US Department of Justice in April 2011. However, that particular claim may actually go to Costa Rica-registered Infiniti Poker.  Unlike other regulated gambling jurisdictions issuing licenses, Costa Rica does not require operators to obtain and verify the identity of its players. On the policy of accepting US players, John Bauer, senior vice president of gaming at CoinBet, proudly emphasized:  ""Look, to take away a person's fundamental right to spend their money on whatever they choose is wrong, unconstitutional, and without question, an un-American thing to do.""  He continued: ""We are not here to engage in a legal debate, we are here to serve up the very first legitimate workaround to the complex online gambling laws in this US market. We are returning to Americans their freedom to choose and giving them their power back!""  Internet gambling in the US operates in a legal grey area. Other gaming operators in the near future may come to appreciate Bauer's statement because the US jurisdiction has yet to see a clarifying test case in the matter of bitcoin-only wagering without conversion.

42376859,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erFT,1391076109,Mint Teams up With Coinbase to Add Bitcoin Support,"Financial planning firm Mint has added bitcoin support to its service, following a deal with wallet provider Coinbase.  Following the move, Mint's popular finance app will allow US users to keep track of their bitcoin investments, alongside more traditional investments.  Hard to ignore  Mint product manager Vince Maniago told Venture Beat that there are already 12 million bitcoins in circulation, adding that 60,000 merchants are already accepting the digital currency via Coinbase. He said:  “We felt like it was something we couldn’t ignore anymore, and this is a good time to go out and support the currency as it becomes more legitimate.”  Coinbase  now has more than 870,000 users, and Maniago was eager to point out that the company has a bigger user base than many official banks. Mint itself has more than 10 million users. It also tracks more than 16,000 financial institutions in North America and supports more than 17 million individual financial accounts.  Mainstream adoption  Although the size of the bitcoin economy is dwarfed by the traditional financial institutions covered by Mint, it is expanding rapidly and beginning to attract more mainstream attention.  However, Mint is treating bitcoin as an asset – not a currency. This is hardly surprising, as many national regulators and financial institutions view bitcoin as a commodity. Maniago said:  “I bought some bitcoin as an investment and realized it wasn’t easy to track my bitcoin balance alongside all my other investments [...] Bitcoin value can fluctuate so much, which is precisely why Mint is treating it like an investment.”  Maniago believes bitcoin and Wall Street are coming together. He argues bitcoin will exist alongside traditional finances despite its somewhat controversial reputation in certain circles.  For the time being, the two will coexist in the Mint app, allowing users to keep track of their bitcoin investments alongside their existing investments.
