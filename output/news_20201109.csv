42433051,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO361h,1604961011,"SEC Commissioner Peirce Says Regulations Should Be Slow, Though Crypto Rules Could Be Faster","The U.S. government operates at a slower pace than the private sector when it comes to innovation, but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, said Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) member Hester Peirce.      Speaking Monday at CoinDesk’s Bitcoin for Advisors event with financial adviser Steve Sanduski, the second-term commissioner shed light on how the securities regulator is approaching financial technology innovation, including cryptocurrencies.      “Regulators are slow and there's a reason we’re slow. We need to have [a] process in place so that we make sure when we’re changing rules people have notice that we’re thinking about changing a rule and they can comment,” she said.      Ideally, regulations and guidance would not limit which technologies can be used, allowing innovators to build a wide range of compliant tools and platforms.      That being said, Peirce noted that certain regulations are very dated, and said she would like to see the agency move faster in certain areas, pointing to cryptocurrencies as one example.      “There are circumstances where we have a framework at the SEC that was built in the 1930s and 1940s and added on over time,” she said. “Certainly now that we’re seeing what's happening in the crypto space, for example, there are areas we are going to have to make adjustments and I do think we should move faster … I’m impatient there.”      Allowing token offerings to operate in a regulatory safe harbor like the one Peirce has proposed and creating retail access to bitcoin through regulated products like an exchange-traded fund (ETF) are two areas where the SEC could move more quickly, she said.      Asked how much influence the SEC’s five commissioners have on such decisions, she noted that usually the agency’s staff approves or disapproves products like ETFs. The commissioners themselves do not normally get involved, but “in the case of the bitcoin [ETFs] we’ve been able to weigh in,” she said.    See also: Mapping the Future of the SEC (There’s a Nonzero Chance Hester Peirce Takes Over)    Other areas, like approving broker-dealers to provide digital asset services in the U.S., are more complicated due to the fact that there are multiple regulatory authorities overseeing these companies, she said.      Asked about the future direction of the SEC, given the projection that former Vice President Joe Biden will be the next president of the United States, Peirce said regulators are likely to continue working on crypto.      “I think those things are tied together in the sense that certainly the president is the one who’s going to nominate the chairman; but even within, you’ve seen some really great steps taken by a regulator like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency where the OCC sat down and said, ‘Hey we’re not really great at handling innovation’ so [it] set up an office of innovation,” she said.      She also pointed to the fact that there are congresspeople on both sides of the political aisle who are bullish on crypto and said support for the sector is bipartisan.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/09/sec-commissioner-peirce-says-regulations-should-be-slow-though-crypto-rules-could-be-faster,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42385084,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAn1DX,1604959047,Flaw in Bitcoin SV Multisig Wallet Puts Funds at Risk,"When Bitcoin SV (BSV) forked from Bitcoin Cash, its mandate to create a faster, payments-focused blockchain required gutting some of Bitcoin’s key technical features.      In doing so, it gutted some of Bitcoin’s key features; now, it’s worse off for it.      One of these features, the so-called pay-to-script hash (P2SH) function, allows a user to send a transaction by signing it to a “script” rather than a public key address. These scripts create special conditions that must be met in order to access the bitcoins sent to them, and they are most often used in multisignature transactions – or, transactions that require more than one party to approve.      Before P2SH transactions came to Bitcoin in 2012, Bitcoin’s only transaction type would send payments to a public key address through the pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH) function.    BSV’s homebrewed multisig wallets have been hacked    Bitcoin Core developer and former Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell posted on Reddit’s r/bsv that BSV developers removed the P2SH feature some time ago from the BSV blockchain’s code. In the ElectrumSV wallet (“and presumably elsewhere,” Maxwell says in the post), developers replaced the feature with a bootleg, BSV-specific version called “accumulator multisig” that utilized P2PKH transactions instead.      There’s a reason Bitcoin uses P2SH for multisig and not P2PKH, because the latter is not ideal for multisignature transactions.      It’s so insecure, in fact, that BSV holders are losing funds, Maxwell says in the post.      “These scripts had no security at all,” he explains.      According to Maxwell, the code’s architects only checked to see if the multisig transactions would work with the exact number of private keys needed to send the transaction (a multisig wallet requires more than one private key to authorize a transaction). They did not test transactions if more or fewer keys than necessary are present.      In his testing, Maxwell found two significant problems: first, that multisig spends fail if more than the minimum number of keys sign a transaction. Second, anyone could tap the multisig funds “with too few signatures (such as none at all).”      Read more: In Big Block Hard Fork, Craig Wright’s Bitcoin Has Left Nodes Behind      One BSV user, Aaron Zhou, lost 600 BSV to an attack exploiting this weakness on his multisignature wallet. When enquiring about the loss to a developer in a BSV chatroom, Zhou said that he trusted “it was safe enough” because “it was introduced by CoinGeek,” a pro-BSV media outlet bankrolled by Calvin Ayre, a close friend of BSV creator Craig Wright. By way of response, a developer in the chat chastised Zhou by saying he should only have committed “small amounts” to the wallet.    If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it    With a tone of frustration in his post, Maxwell said that “the error could have been avoided with even the most basic testing or review.”      The fiasco is a reminder that cryptocurrency development comes with trade-offs and requires diligence. BSV’s founders and proponents have marketed it as payments-focused coin with massive block sizes and blisteringly fast transaction times. To achieve these properties, BSV developers chose to strip Bitcoin’s code of key features. As evidenced by the multisig fiasco, this can come at the expense of security.      When money is on the line, you can’t move fast and break things. Often criticized as a slow-grinding, too-conservative process, Bitcoin development often proceeds with the principles of caution and precision in mind.      Unsurprisingly, as a Bitcoin Core developer Maxwell favors this methodical approach over the perfunctory one.      “This situation would have been avoided entirely had BSV not ripped out the competent, time-tested and highly peer-reviewed mechanisms for multisig by Bitcoin in favor of far less efficient home-brew crypto,” said Maxwell.      “Kinda makes you wonder what amazing bugs are lurking in their node software or wallets. I can say for sure: I'm not going to run any of it and risk finding out.”      Developers at ElectrumSV have not yet returned answers to questions from CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,BSV,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | BSV | FORKS,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/09/flaw-in-bitcoin-sv-multisig-wallet-puts-funds-at-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2155a9994fa369729a6c69af36df4e4c3fd68051-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385097,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAn1Nb,1604957134,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drops as Low as $14.8K; ETH Options Open Interest at Record High,"Bitcoin is gyrating amid rallying global stock markets while ether options traders ramp up open interest as the Ethereum network heads for an ambitious upgrade.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $15,384 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.05% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $14,845-$15,842  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving average, a bullish signal for market technicians.    After bitcoin rallied over $200 on news that Pfizer’s vaccine trial showed it was 90% effective in preventing coronavirus infections, the price suffered a drop of almost $1,000 within hours Monday. The sell-off went from $15,842 shortly after Pfizer’s announcement early in the morning to as low as $14,845 around 16:30 UTC (8:30 a.m. ET). It has since recovered, changing hands at $15,389 as of press time, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      “Bitcoin’s retracement through the $15,000 level is a continuation of the gradual move downward during the past few days,” said Guy Hirsch, managing director for U.S. at multi-asset brokerage eToro. “Though today, it feels different than the likely profit-taking that occurred over the weekend.”      Cindy Leow, portfolio manager for multi-strategy crypto trading firm 256 Capital Partners, has been tracking bitcoin’s volume-weighted average price, or VWAP, as a indicator as prices take a break from a rally that took the world’s oldest cryptocurrency to record 2020 highs the past week. VWAP gives an average price at which an asset has traded throughout the day based on both volume and price.      Read More: Bitcoin’s Weekly Close Above 2019 High Leaves Runway Clear to $20K      “In the short term, we're entering into whipsaw markets that typically follow huge gains,” Leow noted. “We see immediate support at BTC's monthly VWAP of $14,700, from which BTC has steadily bounced off of, indicating that buyers still maintain control.”      A change in market dynamics is also playing a role in staving off possible price downside. That’s due in large measure to the waning influence of leveraged derivatives venue BitMEX, which is facing lawsuits and the ire of U.S. regulators.      “It's fascinating that this whole move up last week from $13,900 to $15,900 happened with so few long liquidations and barely any corrections so far,” Leow said. “We suspect this is largely an effect of trading volumes going from BTC-margined futures to USDT-margined futures, as USDT-margined traders are by default technically in a short BTC position.”      Liquidations on BitMEX, as tracked by data aggregator Skew, are on the decline.      Meanwhile, traditional markets are seeing major action Monday, the first trading day since a clear winner in the U.S. presidential election was decided. Former Vice President Joe Biden is set to take office in early 2021.      Read More: Crypto Impact Unclear After Joe Biden Unseats Donald Trump      Stocks are up across major global indices.    The Nikkei 225 closed in the green 2.1% as investors signaled optimism the incoming U.S. president will promote closer ties to Asia than the incumbent.  Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day up 4.6% as positive investor sentiment on a coronavirus vaccine lifted the index.  In the United States the S&P 500 gained 2.7% as good news regarding the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines from both Pfizer and BioNTech boosted the index.    In addition, big moves are occuring in major commodities, with oil way up and gold way down.    Oil was up 7%. Price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude: $40.01.  Gold was in the red 4.4% and at $1,864 as of press time.    Read More: Markets Spike as Coronavirus Vaccine Trial Shows 90% Success Rate      “With the S&P 500 touching a new all-time high today alongside news of a Pfizer COVID vaccine showing strong promise, it will be interesting to see how BTC behaves in the weeks ahead,” said Daniel Kohler, liquidity manager at San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin. “For the past few weeks we were seeing a rise in BTC and S&P 500 correlations — with BTC trading at levels not seen since 2017, it will be interesting to see if that trend reverts or we continue to see outperformance.”      In fact, the trend does already seem to be reverting, with correlation dropping this past week through Friday’s close.      “Surprisingly, given the recent correlation with equities, bitcoin’s immediate price action has been much more choppy,” added Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto brokerage Bequant.    Ether options interest at all-time high    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Monday trading around $447 and slipping 1% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Open interest in ether options hit a record high Sunday, at over $570 million. The last time open interest approached that level was Sept. 1, when it was at $544 million.      Greg Magadini, chief executive officer of data aggregator Genesis Volatility, says the progress of the Ethereum’s network’s move to upgrade to “2.0” has options traders increasingly placing their bets on the outcome.      “On the night of the U.S. elections, we saw the quiet release of the ETH 2.0 deposit contract,” Magadini told CoinDesk “As we inched closer to the launch of Phase 0 the excitement triggered an increase in ETH option volume traded last week.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all red Monday.

42385086,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAn19l,1604956364,Why Bitcoin Needs Philosophy,"It’s unsurprising when computer scientists research Bitcoin. Bitcoin is software, after all. And because Bitcoin uses incentives to shape human behavior, it also makes sense that economists study it, too. As a novel and provably scarce asset that can be transmitted across the globe without intermediaries – and one that has exhibited explosive price behavior – academics are bound to be interested in Bitcoin.      Yet, few philosophers have written anything about Bitcoin. One might wonder why they’d even try, or whether anyone would care if they did. But Bitcoiners should care.      Here’s why: Bitcoin has a lot of moving parts, none of which are particularly novel in themselves. The cryptography is off-the-shelf. Peer-to-peer protocols arrived years before the white paper emerged in 2008. And so had the notion of proof-of-work. Incentives? Scarcity? Welcome to Econ 101. But nothing before Bitcoin had combined these ingredients ​like this​. Bitcoin uniquely bundles from across traditional boundaries.    Andrew M.

Craig Warmke is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Northern Illinois University. Together, they are writing a book on Bitcoin as a tool to resist corporate and state overreach.    Philosophy is similar. Whereas some disciplines focus on particular subjects or deploy only certain kinds of data – lab or experimental results, survey findings, formal or intuitive models – philosophy has no boundaries at all in either subject matter or underlying data. Philosophers ask questions about everything, and use any evidence they can find to assess answers. Philosophy is all-inclusive,​ the ultimate bundled interdiscipline.      Bitcoin pairs well with philosophy because every one of its ingredients falls within the purview of philosophical research. Philosophers draw from whatever evidence is relevant – and evidence relevant to Bitcoin spans psychology, economics, cryptography and more. But neither psychology, nor economics, nor cryptography, nor computer science alone provides a deep understanding of the system as a whole. A bird’s eye view of Bitcoin is necessarily a philosophical one.      In short: Philosophy bundles, and so does Bitcoin. They’re natural partners, and philosophy is well-suited for Bitcoin. But what can it do for the Bitcoin community?    Speculators need to understand what Bitcoin ​is before plowing money into a BTC position.    Well, philosophy often deals with ​normative questions – questions not just about what ​is​, but also questions about what ​should or ​ought to be, what is ​good or ​bad​, ​just or ​unjust​. If you want to understand SHA-256 or UTXOs, ask a cryptographer or software engineer. If you want to understand how monetary supply relates to velocity and real buying power, ask an economist.      But if you want to know whether the financial privacy that Bitcoin can provide is ​good​, or whether its disinflationary monetary policy promotes ​justice or ​ought to command your support – ask philosophers. Even when a philosopher doesn’t answer your questions decisively, they can help you find and weigh diverse factors.      You might worry that philosophy is more about questions than answers. And we did just concede that philosophers might not answer questions conclusively. But to bypass philosophy for that reason is to misunderstand what it offers. Philosophers don’t just pose questions, smirk and then go on their merry way. We try to answer them. Sometimes we succeed. But even when we don’t, we outline what good answers should look like, give reasons to prefer some answers over others, outline criteria by which to judge answers, and so on. Philosophy isn’t just about the questions or the answers. It’s about the ​reasons​. And reasons deepen understanding, even when they’re not conclusive.      See also: Decentralization Philosophy – Does Crypto Still Need Catalysts?      When done well, philosophy takes us beyond slogans and into the hard work of figuring things out – without any topical or evidential limits.      Normative reasoning isn’t idle. It’s the beating heart of the Bitcoin community. Here is an optimistic hypothesis: Bitcoiners want more than to just get rich; they also want to make the world better. But is the world better off without centralized financial institutions? Questions like this are complicated, discipline-spanning, and normative – they are, in other words, philosophical. And we need the disciplinary tools of philosophy to understand Bitcoin and assess its promise.    Into the mixer    Let’s look at an example in more detail.      If you’ve thought about Bitcoin’s architecture, you know that it uses UTXOs and not accounts, and you may have heard about mixers, CoinJoin, CoinSwap and other privacy-enhancing techniques. Bitcoin can promote financial privacy. But what’s the value of financial privacy? How can you be better off just because someone doesn’t know how you use your money? Philosophical reasoning here can help us move beyond easy slogans and into genuine inquiry. Consider the following (​inspired by a classic article on privacy​):      Conclusion: It’s good to CoinJoin because it secures your financial privacy, and financial privacy is good.      How so?      First: There are some things you’d tell your doctor that you’d not tell your friends, and vice versa. And rightly so; a friendship is a different kind of relationship than a doctor-patient one.      Second: It is healthy to relate to different people differently. Why? Variety in relationships – friends, lovers, compatriots, colleagues – is a delight and one of the things that makes life worth living. It is good that different people know different things about you and thus relate to you in fundamentally divergent ways. Your relationships with your bosses and co-workers and other acquaintances would likely falter if they knew everything about you that your best friend does.    Bitcoiners want more than to just get rich, they also want to make the world better.    Third: What you do with money shows who you are at heart. To know what you do with your money – which organizations and political causes you donate to and how much you donate to them, or what flavor and size of condoms you buy, for example – is to know you. What you’re willing to give up in exchange for something shows what you really value in ways that mere words cannot.      See also: Ben Noys – What Crypto Sees in Accelerationism      Fourth: Though Bitcoin has a public blockchain, it can be used in ways that protect financial privacy. To use CoinJoin is to join a monetary crowd and obscure the details of your buying, selling, and saving from prying eyes – friendly or otherwise.      We can put these steps together to conclude that using CoinJoin is good. It allows you to filter who knows what about your money and, hence, your heart. It preserves the valuable ability to keep separate relationships separate.      An intriguing line of reasoning! There might be something to it, even if it’s not airtight. But notice two things. First, thinking like this takes us beyond obvious questions and catchphrases. It gives us ​reasons​.      Second, we drew on a theory about human relationships and their differentiation (psychology), a hypothesis about how behavior reveals character (an application of the theory of revealed preferences from economics and a theory about what those revealed preferences say about us), and an observation about CoinJoin (applied computer science). It’s only in pulling all of these together that we can make progress in our thinking. That’s philosophy. That’s just one illustration of how philosophy can help sharpen an important question and use various kinds of evidence in addressing it. Here are some more, along with the area of philosophy that covers them:    What is Bitcoin? What is its nature? What kind of thing is it – what ontological category does it belong to? (metaphysics)  What, precisely, is a Bitcoin transaction? Is it speech or expression? What legacy legal structures apply to it? (metaphysics and philosophy of law)  When I use CoinJoin, do I take on risks for which I can be legitimately blamed? My use of the medium enables privacy through obscurity for others. What steps should I take to limit my moral liability when CoinJoining alongside, say, someone who’s laundering profits from human trafficking? Is the “principle of double effect” in effect here? (applied ethics)  The question above can be flipped and is no less important. When I use physical U.S. dollars, do I take on risks for which I can be legitimately blamed? My use of the medium enables privacy through obscurity for others. What steps should I take to limit my moral liability here? (applied ethics)  When does a hard fork create a fundamentally new asset? Could BTC persist as one and the same asset after undergoing changes to its monetary policy? Do hard forks change Bitcoin or replace it with something else? (metaphysics)  Should market mechanisms govern the supply of money, or should this be left to democratic institutions? Is there a place for technocratic rule of monetary systems? (political philosophy)  Should I operate my own full listening node, especially when the benefits to me or to the network are small, on any given occasion? How should I weigh the positive externalities of a healthy network against my own immediate convenience? (applied ethics)    In each of these cases, computer science or economics alone won’t address our most pressing questions about Bitcoin. We need to bring together all that we know about those disciplines as well as metaphysics, philosophy of law, ethics and so on. We need to bundle. We need philosophy.  Some think of philosophy as idle navel-gazing. And some philosophical questions fit that mold. But the questions above? Anyone reading this article has a stake in them. Speculators need to understand what Bitcoin ​is before plowing money into a BTC position. Advocates need arguments with greater depth than “Number Go Up” and “Printer Go Brrr” if they’re to genuinely persuade their audience of a long term value thesis. Regulators (and ordinary voters who put them into office) need practical wisdom in assessing Bitcoin’s growing relevance and the underlying motivations of its users. And conscientious users need to assess how to best join a monetary revolution without unnecessarily harming others – or themselves.

SEN, which replaces clunky wire transactions by allowing corporates to instantly move U.S. dollars between crypto exchanges including on nights and weekends, saw its volume increase $7.8 billion to $17.4 billion in the first quarter, according to a recent Silvergate Bank earnings call.      Existing members of Silvergate’s SEN payment network include Gemini, Kraken and ErisX.      “We’ve launched SEN for our corporate clients so now they’re able to move dollars through Silvergate around the clock instantaneously,” Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley said in an interview. “It’s a huge advantage for clients that are trying to get funds into Binance.US to be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and we’re excited to see the impact on the rest of our liquidity.”      Read more: Silvergate Bank Sees 40% Increase in Deposits From Digital Currency Customers      Coley said all the API integrations with SEN had gone smoothly, having conducted testing with around a dozen or so clients. “We’ve seen about five times the growth of their current trading behaviors on the platform by just the testing of SEN,” she said.      Binance.US has been working hard, jumping through various regulatory hoops to reach this point. The company had also been working with Nevada-based Prime Trust, which remains a dollar custody solution for retail customers of Binance.US, Coley said.      “We are thrilled to welcome Binance.US to our rapidly growing Silvergate Exchange Network,” Alan Lane, Silvergate CEO, said in a statement. “We are confident the SEN will accelerate their vision and bring value to their business.”      Binance.US’s relationship with Binance, the octopus-like crypto conglomerate of global partnerships and affiliations, has been the subject of some scrutiny.

42385094,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAn1IZ,1604943534,"Blockchain Bites: Figure Files for Banking Charter, Cred for Bankruptcy","Cred is the first U.S. crypto lender to file for bankruptcy in the country. Ripple is opening regional headquarters in the Middle East. President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration appears to be courting at least two pro-crypto political actors for cabinet positions.    Top shelf    Bankruptcy filing Crypto lender Cred filed for bankruptcy protection this weekend. In a Chapter 11 filing, the company announced it has hired a new board member to oversee restructuring and will consider M&A opportunities. CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reports Cred has previously disclosed “irregularities” in the handling of corporate funds by a “perpetrator of fraudulent activity,” a situation that required the firm to temporarily halt its CredEarn lending program. According to its filing, Cred listed estimated assets of between $50 million and $100 million and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million.      Bank charter Figure Technologies, a blockchain-based financial lender, has applied for a national bank charter. Approval by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would simplify compliance and cut costs by allowing the startup to offer its services across the nation and consolidate its reporting duties under one office. Currently holding 96 licenses from 49 states, CEO Mike Cagney said without the national charter Figure could end up with 200 licenses by next year. Cagney previously ran SoFi, a crypto-friendly lender, which received an OCC national bank charter last month.      New office Ripple has set up a regional base in Dubai, following several instances of the payments startup publicly stating it would consider leaving the U.S. due to stringent financial regulations. The San Francisco-based firm’s new office – its Middle East and North Africa (MENA) headquarters – will be within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), a financial hub with its own ""independent judicial system and regulatory framework,"" according to its website. Despite statements from CEO Brad Garlinghouse, there is still no indication Ripple plans to cut ties with the U.S.      Pro-crypto? It is still unclear how, if at all, President-elect Joe Biden’s administration will affect the cryptocurrency industry, experts say. Depending on how Biden’s cabinet fills outs could seed “a lot of change” in federal handling of crypto, Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, said. Reportedly, Boston Fed director Lael Brainard, who is overseeing digital dollar research, is a top candidate for the U.S. Treasury Department, while former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler is being considered to be Wall Street’s top cop.      Privacy standards California’s Proposition 24, also known as the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), could be a boon to crypto firms looking to comply with Europe’s strong privacy protections. An update to California’s currency consumer data protections, the new law, if passed, would allow people to manually opt out of biometric, racial and other forms of data collection. Thus, bringing California’s internet startups closer to Europe’s standards. While the proposition has critics, at least one crypto firm supported the measure. “An increasingly digital world means that more and more personal data is available for companies to profit off of, and laws like this are a good step towards ensuring user privacy,” said Kosala Hemachandra, the founder and CEO of MyEtherWallet.    Quick bites  How did a massive devaluation of the Egyptian pound inspire a $100 million bitcoin ETP? (The Breakdown/CoinDesk)  Experts weigh in on how a digital dollar may affect inflation. (CoinDesk)  Bitcoin overtakes the base money supply of the United Kingdom and Russia combined. (Trustnodes)  Crypto traders want trading bots – but don’t trust them. (Decrypt)  Not-for-profit claims ING-owned payments firm helped facilitate boiler rooms and crypto scams. (The Block)  Market intel    Gradual gains Bitcoin closed last week at least $1,600 above 2019’s yearly high of $13,880, supported by increased sales from the cryptocurrency’s network of miners. On Sunday, nearly 1,129 BTC were moved from miner wallets to cryptocurrency exchanges – the biggest single-day outflow since December 2019 – amid a seven day trend that saw miners sell more than they brought in. (Miners tend to sell during strong markets.) Still, CoinDesk Omkar Godbole reports bitcoin is consolidating towards an early support price of $13,880, with some signs the crypto is overbought.    At stake    Financial planners Financial advisors are waking up to the prospect of bitcoin as a portfolio investment.      In a recent CoinDesk op-ed, macro trader Damanick Dantes wrote that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could be a way to diversify a client’s assets, without taking on outsized risk, in an increasingly risky environment.      Given the Federal Reserve’s stated commitment to boosting inflation, while depressing interest rates, wealth managers see bitcoin as a monetary hedge. Dantes specifically looks at bitcoin’s strong correlation with negative-yielding debt and low correlation with traditional assets like the S&P 500 to guide his thinking.      “Even a small allocation to bitcoin could help offset the impact of rising inflation, which will erode the purchasing power of cash – currently yielding close to nothing,” he wrote.      But it’s not just family office managers or individual financial planners that have picked up on the scent. JPMorgan analysts have found the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is outperforming gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). (Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.)      In a Nov. 6 report, obtained by CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo, the analysts posit that institutional investors – like family offices and asset managers – could be driving this demand.      The analysts further stated that “the potential long-term upside for bitcoin is considerable if it competes more intensely with gold as an ‘alternative’ currency.” It was a point echoed by Legg Mason Capital Management CEO Bill Miller, in a CNBC appearance.      The risks of bitcoin going to zero are “lower than they’ve ever been before,” Miller said, further predicting that every major investment bank and high net worth firm will eventually have exposure to bitcoin or commodities like gold.

42385093,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAn1L5,1604930410,First Mover: What's Next for Bitcoin as Wall Street Gets Vaccine Booster,"Bitcoin was higher for a second day, staying in a range of between roughly $15,200 and $15,600, as news of progress in developing a coronavirus vaccine appeared to touch off a rally in U.S. stocks.      With the outcome of last week's U.S. presidential election now mostly settled, crypto analysts turned to other market factors, such as whether investors and bitcoin miners might take advantage of the recent price increase to pocket gains.      ""The week ahead is not as easy to call,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the cryptocurrency-focused financial firm Diginex, wrote in a note to clients. ""The initial thoughts lead me to believe we will consolidate, with support levels being tested throughout the early part of the week. Profit taking could feature.""      In traditional markets, reports of a successful vaccine pushed up U.S. stock futures. Gold changed hands at $1,915 an ounce, down 1.9% for the biggest drop in a month.    Market moves    The U.S. election is over. Whew.      What remains is the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, nations are saddled with debt, foregone revenue is driving up corporate bankruptcies and some 10 million fewer Americans are employed than at the start of the year. A divided U.S. Congress at a time when President Donald Trump is still challenging the outcome of the election could stall passage of a new fiscal stimulus bill – anywhere from $750 billion to $1.5 trillion. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that such a package is still badly needed to help the economy heal.      With those downers as the backdrop, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole has dug into the important question of whether the introduction of a digital dollar might spur higher inflation that's been largely absent even after the Fed pumped expanded its balance sheet this year from $4 trillion to more than $7 trillion.      It's an academic question of sorts; the Fed is conducting research on a digital dollar but doesn't appear in any rush to launch one.      But Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester suggested earlier this year that a digital dollar might represent a way for the U.S. central bank to distribute aid directly to Americans – rather than having to wait for Congress to authorize more fiscal stimulus or relying on banks and Wall Street to pass along any monetary stimulus to households and small businesses.      Jeff Gundlach, chief executive of the $141 billion bond fund DoubleLine Capital, recently published a paper authored by Bill Campbell, a portfolio manager at the firm, arguing that central bank digital currencies could ""possess the necessary plumbing to directly deliver a digital currency to individuals' bank accounts, ready to be spend via debit cards.""      ""Such a mechanism could open veritable floodgates of liquidity into the consumer economy and accelerate the rate of inflation,"" Gundlach wrote.      That could have implications for bitcoin, seen by a growing number of investors as a hedge against inflation, as well as for digital-asset markets overall, where privately issued dollar-linked ""stablecoins"" are already circulating widely.      President-elect Joe Biden's stance toward the cryptocurrency is largely a blank slate, as reported by CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De, so it's unknown whether any of his appointees might push for a digital dollar.      With such deep troubles still facing the economy and the traditional financial system, it's hard to rule anything out.      Read more: Debate Rages on Whether a Digital Dollar Will Unleash Inflation    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin's on-chain activity suggests miner confidence in the ongoing price rally.      On Sunday, nearly 1,129 BTC were moved from miner wallets to cryptocurrency exchanges. That's the biggest single-day outflow since December 2019, according to data source Glassnode. Further, miners have run down inventory by 2,647 BTC over the past seven days by selling more than they mined, according to data source ByteTree.      Miners typically sell more when they feel the market has the strength to absorb their extra supply. Conversely, they tend to hoard when the market looks weak. They have to be cautious as mining profitability is positively correlated to price, and their actions often make or break price trends.      ""Miner outflows show it's a great market to sell into,"" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, told CoinDesk over WhatsApp.      The market depth suggests the recent price run looks set to continue. The bullish case looks stronger considering the past week's strong close above the June 2019 high of $13,880. With the breakout, the cryptocurrency has toppled the final technical barrier on the road to a potential new all-time high.      However, bigger gains may be seen following a bout of consolidation or re-test of the former hurdle-turned-support of $13,880, as the daily and weekly chart indicators are signaling overbought conditions.      - Omkar Godbole      Read more: Bitcoin’s Weekly Close Above 2019 High Leaves Runway Clear to $20K    Token watch    Bitcoin (BTC): Investing legend Bill Miller, whose stock picks beat the Standard & Poor's 500 for 15 years, tells CNBC that every major investment bank will eventually own bitcoin or something like it.

42385088,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAn1CH,1604929110,Markets Spike as Coronavirus Vaccine Trial Shows 90% Success Rate,"Both bitcoin and U.S. stock futures shot up on Monday after a U.S. pharmaceutical giant announced positive results from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine.      Risk appetite improved as Pfizer said its experimental vaccine has been 90% effective in preventing infections in the ongoing trial, Bloomberg reported. The news raises hopes that there may soon be an effective treatment for COVID-19, which is again running rampant through regions such as the U.S. and Europe.      CoinDesk data shows that as the news broke, bitcoin jumped from $15,500 to $15,840 in the 15 minutes to 12:00 UTC. That came as the futures tied to the S&P 500 surged over 100 points to reach a record high of $3,648, and Dow Jones futures rose 1,500 points.      Gold, meanwhile, fell from $1,950 to $1,900 as investors sold safe-haven assets amid the rally on Wall Street.      The coronavirus pandemic brought the global economy to a near standstill in the second quarter and its recent resurgence is threatening to derail the fragile economic recovery. The vaccine news, therefore, bodes well for growth-sensitive stocks and other risky assets.      While the S&P 500 futures continue to trade near record highs, bitcoin has erased gains to trade near $10,500.

42385092,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAn1Jp,1604922950,Bitcoin's Weekly Close Above 2019 High Leaves Runway Clear to $20K,"Bitcoin (BTC) made a weekly close above 2019's peak price, toppling the final technical barrier on the road to a potential new all-time high.    The top cryptocurrency by market value ended last week (Sunday, UTC) at least $1,600 above the high of $13,880 observed at the end of June 2019.  Notably, that level marked the last major resistance ahead of a possible continued rally to $20,000, bitcoin's lifetime high reached in December 2017.  Bitcoin jumped over 12% in the week ended Nov. 8, confirming a five-week winning run, the longest since April.  The price rally has been largely attributed to optimism generated by the recent disclosure of bitcoin investments by several public companies, including Square and MicroStrategy.  Further, in a sign of confidence in the market rally, bitcoin miners, who predominantly operate with cash, are looking to sell off more coins.  On Sunday, nearly 1,129 BTC were moved from miner wallets to cryptocurrency exchanges. That's the biggest single-day outflow since December 2019, according to data source Glassnode.  Miners have run down inventory by 2,647 BTC over the past seven days by selling more than they mined, according to data source ByteTree.  This typically occurs when miners feel the market has the strength to absorb their extra supply; conversely, they tend to hoard when the market looks weak.  Such caution is needed because sales by miners, along with institutional investors, have the biggest influence on price, and mining profitability is positively correlated with the cryptocurrency's price.  ""Miner outflows show it's a great market to sell into,"" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, told CoinDesk over WhatsApp.  Meanwhile, Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, said miners could be taking some price risks off the table by using their capital to lock in power prices before the northern hemisphere winter sets in.  Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process and electricity prices hold large sway over profitability.  All these things considered, the recent rally looks to have legs.  That said, bitcoin may consolidate or retracing toward the former resistance-turned-support at $13,880 before extending the bull run.  Technical indicators on both the daily and weekly charts are reporting overbought conditions.  ""BTC is consolidating, and there is still enough fresh money to stabilize the price,"" Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, told CoinDesk.  Heusser added that some advanced traders are starting to rotate a portion of their bitcoin gains into alternative cryptocurrencies, many of which have suffered 50%-80% losses over the past two months.  At press time, bitcoin is trading largely unchanged on the day near $15,510, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin PriceIndex.  Disclaimer: The author holds small positions in bitcoin and litecoin.

42385082,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAn13T,1604919342,Norway Central Bank Official Says 'No Acute Need' to Introduce a Digital Currency,"The deputy governor of the Norway's central bank said there's no urgent need for the nation to launch a digital krone during a speech at the country's Finance Payments Conference on Thursday.      Outlining the Norges Bank's current assessment of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for real-time payments, Ida Wolden Bache said Norway is already seeing falling levels of cash use and increasing adoption of payment apps tapping bank deposits that may be factors in deciding on such a launch.      But cash serves several useful functions to society that users are not necessarily aware of when choosing payment methods, Wolden Bache continued. These include as a backup should electronic payments not be available, as ""widely accessible"" legal tender and as a ""credit risk-free alternative to bank deposits.""      As such, the question is not should the Norges Bank introduce a digital currency to work alongside cash, but rather would anything important be lost if it didn't and cash ""died out.""      ""Could CBDC provide more than cash can offer, in the form of a greater range of uses and more innovation?"" Wolden Bache asked.      There are other factors, too, with the deputy governor citing the need to be prepared with a CBDC should the payments system move in a different direction than can be predicted currently – what she called the ""precautionary principle.""      The deputy governor said challenges from ""different forms of money"" like the libra cryptocurrency project initiated by Facebook should be taken into account. So, too, must ""structural changes"" in banks' payment infrastructure.      ""We must think through the effect these changes may have on competition, contingency solutions and national governance and control of the payment system,"" she said.      Norges Bank has been investigating CBDCs since 2017, yet a potential introduction is still ""some way off"" according to Wolden Bache. ""The lack of urgency reflects our view so far that there is no acute need to introduce a CBDC.""      That's largely because CBDCs raise ""fundamental questions as to the role of central bank money,"" according to the official. ""This is much more than a question of technology.""      A CBDC introduction would bring a ""substantial change"" in the monetary system and would require a decision from government as well as possible changes to banking law, she said.      Also read: Digital Euro Within Decade ‘Very Likely,’ Says Finland’s Chief Central Banker      The central bank's CBDC research is now its third phase, expected to be completed early next year. Wolden Bache detailed that Norges Bank is working on defining the features a CBDC should have and looking at technical solutions.      ""We are also drawing on other central banks' experience and plans,"" Wolden Bache said. ""Possible strategies for testing and experimenting with technological solutions are also being assessed.""      Most central banks now appear to be at least looking into CBDCs, with a few starting to state publicly that a launch is likely in coming years, while China is already closing in on a launch in the near future.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/09/norway-central-bank-official-says-no-acute-need-to-introduce-a-digital-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dae27301f49aa28538dae08986dc4f89e48d0889-1200x791.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sponsored by Sen. Nellie Pou (D.-35), a bill known as the ""Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Act"" was introduced to the state Senate last Thursday.  Senate bill 3132 seeks to regulate cryptocurrency service providers under the oversight of the N.J. Department of Banking and Insurance.  The proposed law would require the issuance of a license for any entity looking to provide digital asset trading, storage, purchase, sales, exchange, borrowing/lending or issuance services.  Those entities, including businesses and individuals, will not be able to conduct any business activity unless they have either obtained a license in New Jersey or have a reciprocal license in another state.  Unlicensed entities operating in New Jersey could be on the hook for $500 a day until an application for a license is filed.  The senate bill follows the introduction of same legislation to the state's General Assembly in February (where it's bill number A2891) and subsequent referral to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.  A presence in both houses would appear to signal a high likelihood the bill could become law if signed by Gov. Phil Murphy, or at least is being taken seriously.
