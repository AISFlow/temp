If liquidity has already bottomed, then it's likely Bitcoin has too. In the short term, I expect a sell-off. One last chance to buy the dip. Thesis Summary Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has started off the year with a bang, rallying over 60%. “Risk-on” assets have been performing well, which can be explained by the increase in global liquidity. Even though the Fed may still have some tightening left to do, from a global perspective, has liquidity bottomed? And if this is the case, has Bitcoin bottomed? BTC is very strongly linked with liquidity, which is why holding it during increasing liquidity is so important. Though a bottom could be in, we need more evidence, and we will get it once Bitcoin begins its next pull-back. The Liquidity Tsunami The tide has changed, and in 2023 global markets have seen a $1 trillion injection of liquidity. CB reserves (Citi Research) This chart from Citi Research shows the change in global CB reserves over the years. So far in 2023, we have seen Central Bank liquidity increase by $1 trillion, with the main culprits being China’s PBoC and Japan’s BoJ. China is, for the moment, experiencing below-average inflation, and with the economy weakening, the country’s CB has vowed to keep monetary policy accommodative. Last week, the bank already injected 199 billion Yuan, $29 billion, via its medium-term lending facility. But that is not all. The central bank will further strengthen financial support for domestic demand and industrial systems and has vowed to expand the use of an instrument to support private companies' bond financing, the PBOC said on Wednesday following a meeting on Friday. Source: global.chinadaily.com So, plenty of liquidity is coming from China and will probably continue to pour in through the year. What is less clear, is what the BoJ will do: CB Asset Purchases (Bloomberg) The BoJ has been forced to aggressively buy Japanese government bonds due to its yield curve control program. As we can see in the chart above, the BoJ is adding more liquidity than the Fed is taking out at this point. However, the BoJ's leadership is changing, Kazuo Ueda is poised to take the helm , and speculation is he may scrap the YCC policy. We will see. All in all, it seems that global liquidity could have indeed bottomed already, or it could at least be close. While the Fed hasn’t paused yet, it will probably do so this year, and we also have other factors in the US, like the use of the Reverse Repo Facility, which could contribute to loosening financial conditions. Why You Need Bitcoin The idea that liquidity could be turning for good was also recently shared by Michael Howell in an insightful YouTube interview. If we assume this is the case, then where you want to be over the next year and perhaps longer, is in equities and high-beta exposure. In other words, “risk-on” assets. Out of these, Bitcoin is perhaps the best way to go: BTC and Nasdaq correlation (Bloomberg) Bitcoin has become highly correlated with the Nasdaq ( NDX ) but offers a much higher return potential. BTC and NDX performance (TradingView) If we look at the performance since the COVID crash, even after +1 year of bear market, Bitcoin has performed 4x as much as the Nasdaq. At its peak, Bitcoin was up near 700%, while the NDX was up a “measly” 75%. In short, Bitcoin is perhaps the best asset to capture gains in an environment of increasing liquidity. Bitcoin Outlook: Where Fundamentals Meet Technicals Following a significant rally, I think we should see a sell-off in the near future. This makes sense both technically and fundamentally. Bitcoin Outlook (Author's work) Looking at my EWT count, we have two possible scenarios on the table. On the bullish side, we could say that BTC has already completed five waves down. This would mean the rally towards $25,000 where ((A)) is on this chart would be the top of our red wave IV, and the low at $15,500 would be the end of five. This puts us now at an initial impulse of the lows to complete a wave I of this new bull market rally. My target for this is around the $28,000 level based on fib extensions. Following this, we should see a retracement in a wave II which could take us back below $20,000. Alternatively, we could head into new lows, and count this whole structure formed since June 2022 as an ABC correction of the wave IV. The next pullback is what will determine which count we are on. In either case, we should see some form of a sell-off in the near term, followed by a rally. This makes sense fundamentally too. The markets have rallied strongly on lower inflation and the hopes of a Fed pivot. However, strong economic data and persistent inflation could cause the Fed to raise rates as far as 6%. This would certainly deliver a shock to markets and probably ignite a sell-off. However, the Fed will pause in the medium/long term, and other central banks are already injecting liquidity into the system. This means we could be much higher in the next 6-12 months. Takeaway In conclusion, liquidity is on the up, and this is great news for Bitcoin stock, which is one of the best vehicles to capture returns in this environment. With that said, some of the altcoins and even crypto-related equities could greatly outperform Bitcoin. I cover all of these in my marketplace. Ending on a note of caution, and although I am increasingly bullish, there’s no guarantee that Bitcoin has bottomed, but I am watching the signals closely. The dip should be bought, but don’t forget to manage risk.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4580378-its-a-tsunami-and-bitcoin-is-my-surf-board?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9750209.jpeg

42412831,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6Pyi,1677020652,"Filecoin, Storj Tokens Outperform Bitcoin Amid Increased Use of Decentralized Storage Protocols","The native tokens of shared storage protocols have soared over the past week, with an analyst attributing the surge to the platforms' increased usage.  Decentralized storage network Filecoin’s native utility FIL has been among the top performers, soaring from just above $5 a week ago to $8.10 on Tuesday, a more than 62% gain, according to CoinDesk data. FIL has outperformed bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), which have risen 10% and 7%, in the past seven days, respectively.  FIL’s jump comes as Filecoin readies its Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) for a March unveiling. The FVM creates a “runtime environment” for smart contracts. It is expected to enable “new applications for smart contracts,” leading to increased usage, Messari research analyst Mihai Grigore told CoinDesk in an email.  Colin Evran, ecosystem lead at Protocol Labs, the company behind Filecoin, tweeted that writing smart contracts on Filecoin allows users to “create perpetual storage contracts” and their own “storage market,” “on-chain cloud solutions,” “data DAOs” and “DeFi contracts.”  Other computing and storage networks, including cloud storage networks Storj (STORJ) and Siacoin (SC), have climbed 16% for the week. The CoinDesk Computing Index, which measures the market capitalization weighted performance of computing protocols, was up 16% over the past week.  “Competitive pricing, relative to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), makes decentralized storage an appealing choice for Web2 entities seeking cost-effective alternatives for storing large amounts of archival data,” Grigore said.  Elsewhere in markets  On Tuesday, BTC was recently trading at about $24,273, down 2.2%, while ETH was changing hands at $1,647, off 3.5%.  Crypto exchange Bitfinex's analysts said bitcoin’s recent rally to over $25,000 last week was driven by both “over-leveraged long positions” and ""liquidating over-eager shorts.” Investors holding long positions believe an asset will increase in value, while those who hold short positions see an asset decreasing in value.  Data from crypto data provider Coinglass shows that traders who bet on price increases liquidated $130 million of their long positions, while those who bet on price falls liquidated around $179 million of their BTC short positions in the past seven days.  “Historically, this type of price action, where both the longs and shorts are wiped off simultaneously, has resulted in a range formation,” Bitfinex's analysts wrote in an emailed comment, adding: “The most probable move going forward is to scale out of positions partially and wait for the range to form without a strong directional bias.”",POSITIVE,BTC | FIL,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIL | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/21/filecoin-storj-tokens-outperform-bitcoin-amid-increased-use-of-decentralized-storage-protocols,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/370a999c69f4efb35feeba3aa1690c0d016abc33-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412825,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6PsA,1677019953,Caitlin Long Sees 'Coordinated Effort' Among Regulators for Custodia Rejection,"Factions in the Biden administration and the U.S. Federal Reserve were responsible for scuttling crypto-oriented Custodia Bank’s efforts to obtain a master account from the central bank, CEO Caitlin Long claimed Tuesday.  While not naming them, she told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" that crypto is here to stay and regulators will have to deal with it.  “If that anti-crypto faction thinks that crypto is going to go away, or is not going to find its way back into the traditional U.S. banking system, they’re [regulators] going to be playing whack-a-mole for years down the road,” Long said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday.  Long, who has been championing crypto-friendly legislation in her home state of Wyoming, said in a recent blog post she tried to warn federal regulators about a crypto company she claimed was engaging in fraud. While she did not name the company in her post, she said regulators also ignored her warning of a potential for a ""bank run.""  ""It seems to have gone into a black hole,"" she told CoinDesk TV about her warning.  ""But I have tried, and indeed Custodia staff across the board has tried, very hard for the last two and a half years to educate bank regulators on the risks and the upside in these [crypto-related] technologies.""  Custodia Bank, a three-year-old special purpose depository institution in Wyoming, has been at odds with regulators as it tries to push its way into the U.S. banking system. After a long wait, the central bank denied Custodia’s bid for Federal Reserve system membership in January, citing concerns about the “safety and soundness” of the bank. Shortly after, the Kansas City Fed denied Custodia’s “master account” application. Wyoming is in the Kansas City Fed's jurisdiction.  Long said that it “raises interesting questions about the independence of both the Federal Reserve from the White House” and the “Kansas City Reserve Bank from the Federal Reserve Board.”  She claimed the denial of Custodia's application also demonstrates a “coordinated effort among agencies.” According to her, it highlights the key question of whether crypto “should be inside of the regulatory perimeters, should there be regulated versions of it or should it be done outside of the regulated financial system.”  The Cheyenne firm renewed its push for a master account on Friday.  Custodia may be “just the tip of the spear” when it comes to regulatory action. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took extensive action against other crypto-native firms including Kraken and Paxos not long after the Custodia application denial, she said.  Regulators’ actions against the industry could push crypto companies needing funding to banks outside the U.S., Long said, and “that's where the whack-a-mole is going to continue to be played.”  “Light needs to be shown on all this [and] why politicians got involved with a company that wasn't even operating yet,” Long said. “Why was Custodia Bank chosen as the sacrificial lamb, the so-called shooting of the stallion to scatter the herd?”  CoinDesk reached out for comment from regulators including the SEC and Fed.

This is likely caused partly by its manager selling into a crypto bear market. There are legitimate business reasons for Grayscale to desire to turn these products into ETFs. My expectation is that this fund will take a much longer time to get converted into an ETF. The crypto-related investments currently really appeal to the value investor inside of me. I had been slowly building my Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) allocation back up (read more here ). But after the FTX ( FTT-USD ) implosion, I've become more aggressive in expanding crypto-related holdings. I've also been buying the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) (read more here ), which I suspect is suffering the same forced selling as its big Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) sister fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. A commenter on the Ethereum Trust article rightfully pointed out Grayscale has another trust that's smaller in size at $236 million in size that trades at an even deeper discount called the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( GDLC ). I think that fund is also super interesting, but on balance, I think it is a worse choice, especially GBTC, even though it is trading at a deeper discount. What's especially interesting here is that the manager of these trusts is under pressure because a related company, Genesis, is involved in bankruptcy proceedings. There are reports Grayscale is trying to raise funds by selling venture investments or selling its own holdings in the Ethereum Trust and other Trusts. I want to highlight John Miller, who has a very good article out that goes into a lot of detail about this. Starting with the basics, the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund offers exposure to five different cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), and Cardano ( ADA-USD ). The majority of its holdings are really Bitcoin and Ethereum, making up 95% of the value per unit: Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund Holdings (Grayscale) I know very little about Polygon, Solana, and Cardano. I'm really not an expert on their long-term viability. From my understanding, Solana was a major holding on the FTX balance sheet, and it has gotten extra hard around the FTX implosion. Data by YCharts While other cryptos have recovered some of the ground lost during the FTX blow-up, Solana has still quite a bit to go. The reason I think there is a compelling argument to make for this fund over GBTC or ETHE is because the additional discount buys you so much. I've put together a table to illustrate this. The table below shows how much of crypto exposure the price of the funds buys an investor (the funds all have similarly high 2.5% fees): Fund Price Bitcoin exposure in % of price Ethereum exposure in % of price Other exposure in % of price GBTC $12.20 185% 0% 0% ETHE $7.90 211% 211% 0% GDLC $6.17 159% 70% 12% Source: Author's calculations The GDLC fund buys 241% exposure to a basket of cryptos. The Bitcoin exposure of the GDLC fund is only 30% lower compared to the pure-play GBTC, while you get another 70% of the purchase price per unit in Ethereum, alongside 12% of the purchase price in these other larger cryptocurrencies. Compared to pure-play ETHE, you get a lot less Ethereum exposure. The exposure to cryptocurrency is 141% lower. However, you get Bitcoin exposure equal to 159% of the purchase price and 12% of the other large cryptocurrencies alongside it. If you know exactly what you want, either ETHE or GBTC and you think the others are useless, this fund isn't great. If you 1) actually want Bitcoin exposure, but you don't mind the others or 2) aren't completely confident Bitcoin is the way to go, there is merit to going this route. I'm generally enthusiastic about getting a lot of additional crypto exposure at very low prices. I'm not very confident in picking any winners in this space at all. My strategy is to try and pick up a lot of free stuff, a philosophy that isn't exclusive to the crypto space, by the way. GDLC offers that in spades. There is one big problem here. The reason I especially like GBTC and ETHE second is that I expect there will be a catalyst to close the discount somewhere down the line. Grayscale is suing the SEC to try and get the agency to allow it to convert its closed-end Bitcoin fund to an ETF. You're not antagonizing the SEC like this if you don't want to do this. In the prior ETHE article, I've also described why converting makes business sense: I also believe it makes business sense to do so, even though you risk losing assets or having to lower the management fee. ETFs attract way more capital than closed-end funds and are easier to get access to for investors across the world. The largest ETF in an asset class tends to attract the most flows. GBTC is already the largest Bitcoin fund in the world and would have a leg-up establishing itself as the prime ETF. This is a must-have spot to fight for, and I think the company will do so. At some point, I believe Bitcoin will be allowed to be in an ETF. Many smaller asset classes are traded in this wrapper, and as the ecosystem and adoption grows, it makes less and less sense to exclude precisely this one. Once Bitcoin is allowed inside an ETF it should be a matter of time before other cryptos are allowed. However, I think the timeline for Bitcoin is likely the shortest. A multi-asset ETF is a bit more complex and comes with many additional problems. This multi-asset fund is also a lot smaller. With this fund, Grayscale is much worse positioned to become the largest multi-asset crypto ETF. The incentive, business sense, and the timeline make it much less certain this will be converted to an ETF down the line compared to both GBTC and ETHE. With this fund, I believe investors are much more dependent on the underlying assets to do well. In summary; this fund offers much more raw crypto bang for your buck. However, the probability this is converted into an ETF to serve as a catalyst to instantly close the discount to NAV is much lower. I like the crypto exposure, but I'm here for the discount closing. Although I think all three funds are likely to do well over the very long term, at the end of the day, I prefer GBTC and ETHE.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4580369-gdlc-59-percent-discount-to-nav-irresistible?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9748926.jpeg

Prices have increased 1% since the latest cross occurred.  A Golden Cross occurs when the 50-day moving average for an asset crosses above the 200-day moving average. Bitcoin’s latest cross occurred on Feb 18. Bitcoin has seen only six other crosses since 2015. The most recent prior to this latest cross was on Aug. 14, 2021.  A cross reflects BTC’s exponential moving averages (EMA) and not the simple moving average (SMA). The calculation of an asset’s EMA weighs more recent pricing data, whereas SMAs measure each date equally.  Investors opt for one or the other depending on their personal preferences. The SMA group would have seen a cross occur Feb. 7.  Prices initially declined 5.7% in the next two consecutive days but have since rebounded 13%, calculating out to a 6.6% increase since its occurrence.  Bitcoin’s performance following a cross has traditionally been strong, with the average seven- and 30-day returns of 3.8% and 8.3%, respectively.  These percentages compare favorably to seven- and 30-day returns of 1.6% and 7.5% over the entirety of the dataset, indicating the acquiring BTC following a golden cross has been positive. A look back at the SMA crossover shows six other occurrences since 2015, with average seven- and 30-day returns of 2.7% and 10.6%, respectively.  Performing to the average would imply that bitcoin prices will breach $26,500, given its closing price on Feb 18. The current price for BTC has been flirting with $25,000, a psychologically important level, which has been challenging for the asset to hold.

Its adjusted loss of $2.46 per share for the quarter also beat estimates for a loss of $2.52 a share, according to FactSet. But its transaction volume fell 12% quarter over quarter to $322 million on lower overall trading volume.  Shares of Coinbase were up about 0.9% to $62.60 in after-hours trading Tuesday. Alongside the rise in bitcoin prices, Coinbase shares have risen significantly in 2023 so far, up 78%, but they are still down 67% over the last 12 months.  Subscription and service revenues, an area of focus by the company, grew 34% quarter over quarter to $283 million in Q4. Subscriptions and services accounted for nearly 50% of overall revenue in Q4, mostly thanks to interest income, which came in at $162.2 million.  Coinbase said in its shareholder letter that crypto markets have improved so far in Q1 compared to Q4, leading the company to generate $120 million in transaction revenue in January 2023. But the company cautioned investors not to extrapolate those results forward since last year showed quickly the market can change.  The company also said that it expects more crypto regulation in the coming year both in the U.S. and abroad, and it expects to be able to benefit from this. As evidence of progress, it pointed to the finalization of the European Union’s MiCA regulatory framework, as well as other countries such as Brazil, the U.K. and India that have drafted specific and clear legislation for regulating crypto.

42421370,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuCD,1677008656,We're Responsible for Web3 User Journeys; It’s Time to Make Them Completely Self-Custodial,"One thing that’s becoming crucial to the development of Web3 is better “user journeys.” In other words, we need to become better at offering users a seamless, secure, cost-effective and fast way to jump in and out of Web3. More so, it needs to be fully self-custodial from start to finish.  Using Web3 can still feel fragmented and convoluted. At this point it’s still likely that somebody looking to use a decentralized app (dapp) will need to get familiar and interact with either on-ramps or off-ramps in a separate environment. This is far from optimal because it creates a disjointed experience and, more importantly, it leaves room for unnecessary risk – as custodial services take control over funds during one or the other.  Łukasz Anwajler is the chief technology officer of Ramp. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""BUIDL Week.""  Current user journeys  There’s been some progress. Phase 1 of onboarding in Web3 today typically goes like this:  Alice wants to participate in coolNewProject so she creates an account on a popular hot wallet browser extension. Then she goes through a service that will debit her bank account and credit crypto to her self-custodial wallet address. That’s great, because it all happens within the extension that can also fully interact with the project’s decentralized application (dapp).  This could be improved, but it works.  But what happens when Alice sells her non-fungible token (NFT), beats the Web3 game, or makes a pretty penny with her latest decentralized finance (DeFi) strategy? She won’t be able to exchange her funds back into fiat within the app or browser extension. Taking her earnings back to fiat so she can use it in her day to day activities is not as simple. It’s definitely possible, but not simple.  See also: Custodial Wallets vs. Non-Custodial Crypto Wallets  Usually, she’ll have to take some extra steps: Alice will have to manually send the funds from the wallet she connected to the dapp, to her wallet on some other service. For many users this will often be a centralized custodial exchange service that’s linked to their bank account. Then she’ll have to sell her crypto on that service in order to then withdraw the equivalent fiat to her bank account.  Alternative: A complete in-app experience  But users don't need an account with a custodial service to change their crypto back to fiat after using a Web3 application. There are practical widgets that offer dapps the option to easily integrate both ramps natively in a single SDK [software development kit].  This is a step in development that is too often ignored in most Web3 applications. Users are often left in an “easy to get in, hard to get out” situation. In the previous example Alice is left to figure this out for herself and look up off-ramp services. More often than not she’ll resort to a popular custodial platform.  Completely self-custodial user journeys should be the standard. On-ramps and off-ramps should exist natively within each app, closing the loop for a single ad-hoc self-custodial Web3 experience. The option to transfer funds from the dapp to a fiat bank account should be right there in the features menu.  This is similar to what users already know and trust in existing Web2 experiences with online payments and cash-outs. In fact, platforms like PayPal were able to propel whole industries like e-commerce precisely by building an easy, 360-degree user journey for fiat online payments. Web3 can have an equivalent watershed moment if we raise our standards.  There are fiat-crypto infrastructure providers that offer developers convenient ways to integrate these functionalities into their applications’ user journeys, like Ramp.  An ideal user journey would go like this:  Alice wants to use coolNewProject and purchases crypto through a widget that pops right on the dapp’s menu. Then she wants to use her earnings to buy something IRL, so she goes to the dapp and clicks on the off-ramp option right on her main dashboard. A few minutes later, the funds are in her bank account.  Why this needs to be the standard  There are many reasons why going forward, in-app fiat-crypto infrastructure should be the norm and not an afterthought for Web3 applications.  Presenting users – especially newcomers – with a single self-contained “get in, get out” experience reduces the learning curve for using a particular dapp.  A self-custodial user journey is also, by definition, a more secure journey. Users stay in control of their private keys at all times, even if they are not aware of the importance of this feature.  It would make it more cost-effective to interact with the dapp by reducing the number of transaction fees incurred, both for network miners and on exchange services.  Similarly for development teams, it provides them with alternative monetization options while remaining preferable to custodial off-ramping costs. Some developers choose to add a small surcharge to the transaction fee to create an additional and sustainable revenue stream.  Web3 IRL  Users still want to use their funds in the real world. They need to feel that their economic activities in Web3 can fit seamlessly into their real life economic activities. In order to give them a tangible sense that this is the case, we need to make the off-ramp phase of the user journey as simple as the on-ramp. It needs to be in-app, fast and cost-effective.  Likewise, it needs to be secure – it needs to be self-custodial, specifically. While most newcomers won’t immediately understand the importance of this, having fully self-custodial user journeys as the default for on-ramping and off-ramping will benefit the space in the long run.  See also: Why Crypto Is Not an 'Industry' | Opinion  It’s our responsibility to ensure users are in control of their funds from on-ramp to off-ramp and avoid counterparty risk by default.  All the necessary infrastructure for building complete and self-custodial user journeys is already there.

42421367,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnu97,1677005440,It's Time to BUIDL Week,"In April 2020, at the height of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, Silicon Valley heavyweight Marc Andreessen published a call to action for the innovators and dreamers of the world: “It’s time to build.” The U.S. seemed to be in dire straits, according to Andreessen’s diagnosis, after decades of political stagnation and misspent investment. Where were the flying cars, robot assistants and grand public infrastructure we were promised?  Andreessen, who co-created the first web browser, Mosaic, and went on to reinvent the venture capital industry, drew some amount of criticism for his exhortations. But if you look closely it seems like even skeptics of Andreessen’s brand of techno optimism would agree that little is getting built in America. For instance, Ezra Klein, while still at Vox, wrote, “America’s inability to act is killing people” – finding an explanation in the type of political gridlock that political scientist Francis Fukuyama neatly describes as a “vetocracy.”  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week"" and excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     The world has changed significantly since Andreesen’s original essay, but few could honestly disagree that the message still applies. After witnessing COVID-era medical shortfalls, global supply chain disruptions and rising consumer prices – hardships that affect all, but perhaps unequally – it’s clear there’s room yet for innovation. But the old political disagreements still seem to apply. U.S. President Joe Biden made “Build Back Better” a core promise of his election campaign, and was arguably hamstrung when he actually got into office.  That’s partially why the crypto industry remains relevant, and should likely be elevated higher in the public conversation. At their best, crypto protocols are open-source systems available for all. That sounds like a general statement but it’s only because the core mentality of building “credibly neutral” and “general purpose” technologies can be applied anywhere. Web3, rightfully called a buzzword, has hopes for reinventing everything from money to social media and even the internet itself.  This is a challenging time to be writing an essay like this. Last year, after the collapse of a systemically important stablecoin, several bankruptcies and also the collapse of one of the most high-profile crypto on-ramps, the world saw “crypto” at its worst. In the wake of FTX, a massive fraud almost without precedent, the industry must rebuild itself and regain public trust. I’m optimistic that’s not only possible, but probable. As many have noted, the many failures of centralized companies has only proven the viability of and need for true decentralized alternatives.  CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week,” the second edition of Consensus Magazine’s flagship theme week series in 2023, is focused on just that issue. The package will feature profiles of developers including Casey Rodamor, the creator of Bitcoin Ordinals, who remains as committed as ever to making Bitcoin resilient; essays by experts such as SingularityDAO’s Marcello Mari, who is probing the far reaches of where Web3 and artificial intelligence collide; and features covering a range of topics including a community-led hackathon for Solana, a data-driven exploration of Bitcoin’s patronage system and Ethereum’s much-anticipated Shanghai upgrade.  Crypto has taken a hit, but as a friend and former colleague of mine once said, “DeFi has already won.” With exception, disintermediated crypto protocols designed to function during crises have not only done just that but are continuing to grow. That may be why venture capitalists CoinDesk’s Brandy Betz interviewed have said they’re plowing money into crypto “infrastructure,” having learned a hard lesson about the dangers of centralized finance.  See also: Why I Won't Incorporate My Crypto Startup in the US | Opinion  Yet, this optimism comes at a challenging time for crypto. The industry can likely weather another market downturn, but it looks as though the real threat to crypto’s growth will come from the political sector. Ironically, it looks as though many disparate parts of the U.S. legislative and executive branches are finally able to collaborate on regulating crypto – in what some industry experts have called “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” drawing a comparison to the Obama-era policy of directing banks to disfavor legal but unseemly industries.  No doubt rebuilding crypto will involve a collaboration between industry participants and lawmakers to pass laws protecting consumers from fraudulent companies and predatory actors. The hope is that lawmakers will also learn to see crypto as crypto is meant to be, using code to advance everyone’s interests.

Venture capital firm Blockchain Capital led the seed round, and participants in the pre-seed round included Maven 11, KR1, Tokonomy and Fansara.  Superchain Network, which also brands itself as the “Open Index Protocol,"" is a decentralized indexer. The platform organizes on-chain data and allows decentralized application (dapp) developers and users to access the data in seconds.  According to Superchain, applications will need a way to interpret and make use of information as demand for block space continues to grow.  “We believe in unconstrained ownership: no centralized entity should be involved in the relationship between humans and data,” said Maxim Legg, co-founder and chief technology officer at Superchain Network. “With Superchain there is no need to delegate custody or trust to centralized aggregators for access to decentralized data.”  Superchain joins other data indexing protocols such as The Graph and Moralis, who both raised eight-figure rounds last year.  “Incumbents in the indexer space are trying to decentralize Web2 APIs,” said James Corbett, co-founder and CEO at Superchain Network. “Superchain takes a fundamentally different approach. Our data is open and ownable by our users, unlocking use cases that are not possible with GraphQL.”  Superchain is currently offering early access for market makers, quant traders, data scientists and dApp developers.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/21/superchain-network-raises-4-million-to-build-decentralized-data-indexing-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83087f6cbd67c294583015c48cfe9abde266f64a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410823,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrteP,1676998391,SEC’s Shadow Crypto Rule Taking Shape as Enforcement Cases Mount,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler thinks the cryptocurrency industry is playing a game with his agency. He has said that companies are well aware of what they have to do to operate legally within the U.S. but they’ve decided not to do it – some of them in open scorn of the regulator.  Is the crypto industry pretending it doesn’t know what the SEC wants – as the agency keeps illustrating in cases like the recent action against the Terra/Luna ecosystem and its founder – and how long can that go on?  “The law’s pretty straightforward,” Gensler said in response to questions from CoinDesk last week. The ongoing insistence from the industry that the SEC is leaving crypto without clear rules is a “false narrative,” he said.  Late last year, a what-is-the-SEC-waiting-for sense started building among industry insiders, because the crypto enforcement cases had seemingly slowed. Many wondered whether the commission was waiting for the outcome in its key court case with Ripple before forging further into legal battles with crypto firms. But the SEC leapt out of the gates in 2023 with a series of actions and policy decisions with huge potential implications for digital assets.  ""It's been quite deliberate in an attempt to reach more kinds of participants in the market, and have an ability to bring enforcement action across a wider range of targets,"" said Amy Jane Longo, a former trial lawyer for the SEC in Los Angeles who now works at Ropes & Gray. Apart from its campaign against token issuers and platforms, her former agency has been tackling everything from staking services to stablecoins to celebrity promotions.  Industry rebuffed  The industry’s chief complaint hasn’t wavered: The SEC is rebuffing the sector’s pleas for the regulator to issue actual rules, so crypto efforts have no choice but to carry on as the government walls are closing in. But the U.S. securities regulator has been building a fairly detailed set of implied standards with every enforcement action, application ruling or policy decision it makes.  Crypto lawyers are well aware, in most cases, of what the SEC thinks defines a token as a security, leaning on legal standards such as the so-called Howey Test to lay it out over and over in enforcement documents. And the lawyers also know which companies the SEC believes should be registered as national exchanges.  “The SEC has been consistently applying longstanding, well-known, and clear securities laws to crypto activities,” said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a Washington, D.C., group that pushes for tougher financial protections. “The fundamental problem is that the crypto industry has intentionally chosen not to comply with those securities laws.”  Read More: Are the Remaining Crypto Giants Staring Down the Barrel of the US Government’s Gun?  By now, a long list of cases has formed this shadow standard for what’s not OK in digital assets. And the trillion-dollar question is how the SEC is backing up Gensler’s assertion that almost all of the tokens in circulation are securities. The chairman insisted to a group of reporters last week that there are virtually always business interests associated with each token effort, checking one of the boxes for what his agency is weighing in its securities tests.  “Other than bitcoin, where is there not a group of entrepreneurs in the middle?” he asked.  At the end of 2020, the SEC targeted Ripple in a lawsuit that accused it of selling the XRP token as an unregistered security. That case remains in federal court and the eventual decision is bound to send shockwaves through the industry, whichever way it goes.  But the SEC already found some success in the interim with similar accusations against startup LBRY. A federal judge in New Hampshire ruled in November that its native LBC tokens were unregistered securities.  A $50 million settlement with failed crypto lender BlockFi targeted its high-yield lending product. And the agency’s enforcement division even built indirect cases against other tokens and issuers by naming several of them in an insider-trading case against a former manager at Coinbase (COIN).  On the exchange front, the agency went after Poloniex in 2021 as an unregistered exchange, and the company’s $10 million settlement began to signal the SEC’s view on when digital trading platforms should register as national exchanges.  Gensler suggests he’s frustrated over the crypto platforms’ unwillingness to come through his doors.  Kraken’s CEO “publicly said they were never going to register with the SEC – boldly said that,” Gensler said. “These platforms aren't even coming in and asking for the meetings,” he said, adding that “I really deeply respect” the few that have come in.  For their part, industry insiders say the SEC rarely has a real path to offer crypto firms. Longo said few companies have made any headway on the registration question.  “That feels a bit hollow to people in the markets who are trying to figure out how to comply with what the agency wants,” she said.  Enforcement surge  While Gensler continues to warn about the compliance runway growing ever shorter, recent weeks have seen a surge in SEC cases that could further tip the scales.  The agency piled onto the litany of civil and criminal accusations against fallen crypto platform FTX by saying its exchange token, FTT, is an investment contract that should be in the hands of SEC oversight. The regulator then pursued cases against Gemini Trust and Genesis Capital for yield products it also considers securities (like BlockFi’s), and against Kraken, arguing the firm’s staking service fit that same bill. (Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.)  Last week, the regulator accused Terraform Labs and co-founder Do Kwon of deliberately misleading investors about the strength of the doomed TerraUSD stablecoin and – in a now familiar SEC claim – selling unregistered securities. The next in line for the SEC’s securities scrutiny could be Paxos, which received a notice from the agency that it may be in trouble for issuing the Binance USD token as an unregistered security – an accusation Paxos denies.  “For all these settlements and district court cases that are out there, there are still a lot of aspects that are unanswered, and I think that is part of what makes it particularly difficult trying to navigate enforcement risk in this area,” Longo said.  Difficult or not, Kelleher is cheering on the federal authorities.  “The way forward to rein in a knowingly lawless industry like crypto is for regulators like the SEC and prosecutors like the Department of Justice to apply the full force of the law,” he said.  Last year, the SEC bulked up its newly named Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit by 20 positions, signaling the enforcement push we’re seeing now. Setting aside the bulk of the agency’s crypto cases, which were chasing old-fashioned crooks stealing people’s money or pursuing a crackdown on so-called initial coin offerings, the list of consequential cases is still considerable.  Gensler has sought to send a message to the cohort of celebrities that have hawked digital tokens for money, including Kim Kardashian. His agency’s latest action was against National Basketball Association Hall of Famer Paul Pierce, a former star of the Boston Celtics, who agreed to pay $1.4 million last week to settle accusations he’d promoted ethereumMax (EMAX) tokens without disclosing that he was paid $244,000.  With its enforcement actions, the commission has been defining which tokens, yield products and staking services are considered investment contracts in the regulator’s eyes. And it’s also been defining which firms should register as exchanges and how to avoid getting in trouble for marketing tokens while getting paid to do it.  Policy moves  But the SEC has also been shaping the industry with other moves, including its series of high-profile rejections of applications to set up a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Most recently, the regulator has finally moved into policy efforts with explicit mention of the crypto sector.  Last week, the commission proposed a rule that would insist that SEC-registered investment advisers – including massive hedge funds and advisers representing major institutional money – ensure that their clients’ assets only be placed with “qualified custodians.” That’s a narrow range of banks, broker dealers and similarly regulated firms, which Gensler said would leave out unregistered crypto platforms.  While a number of digital assets companies – such as Coinbase, Anchorage Digital Bank, BitGo, Bakkt and Gemini – quickly insisted they could make the grade as custodians under the rule, industry lawyers are still analyzing the 434-page proposal. At the very least, its language throws suspicion on cryptocurrency players.  SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda argued that the rule proposal seemed to “mask a policy decision to block access to crypto,” and he suggested “it is unlikely that crypto assets can be maintained at qualified custodians or traded on crypto trading platforms in compliance with the proposed rule.”  Uyeda, who had worked in the past with congressional Republicans and as an adviser to conservative members of the commission, had previously criticized “regulation by enforcement” more generally in a September speech, so – alongside the commission’s outspoken opponent of government overreach, Hester Peirce – there may be some internal resistance to the SEC’s campaign to shape crypto without writing a direct system of regulations.  “One significant shortcoming of regulation by enforcement is that it fails to provide a mechanism for the commission to consider the views by market participants, which can result in a myopic approach,” Uyeda said at a well-attended conference on SEC policy. “Market participants should be able to look to the commission’s rules rather than compare how their particular facts and circumstances may differ from those in a specific enforcement case.”  Many in the industry argue that relying piecemeal on laws based in the 1930s isn’t a way to establish clear rules of the road for the innovations that set crypto apart from the financial instruments of the past.  “The U.S. has to make a call to get in the game,” said Brett Quick, head of government affairs for the Crypto Council for Innovation. “It’s like we are just dipping our toe in the water when we need to dive in.”",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/21/secs-shadow-crypto-rule-taking-shape-as-enforcement-cases-mount,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c94171eff912b2fe3d4ad593687d9effcab7858b-2880x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421376,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuJR,1676997266,"Web3 Builders Need Better Funding Programs, Not Just Funds","Perhaps the most important sign of resilience in Web3 is the fact that builders remain unfazed by current market conditions. After the recent hype fizzled out and the illusion of infinite money evaporated, most developers have stayed around, proving there are important, real-life use cases to build, regardless. What they need now is more than just money. They need guidance and support.  Developer engagement has grown 297% across all ecosystems since the previous crypto boom in 2018. Even after a recent 70% fall in crypto prices since last year, there’s still an 8% year-over-year growth in full-time developers who are involved with the space. The question now is, what are the best ways to help all these projects succeed despite the market downturn?  Magdalena Oleksy is the ecosystem lead of Aleph Zero, a layer 1 privacy-enhancing blockchain that ensures scalability, low transaction fees and maximum security guarantees for developers. This article is part of CoinDesk’s BUIDL Week.  Better funding programs = better chances of success  The short answer is better funding programs.  “Most startups fail” is a popular Web2 mantra, but it’s not necessary for Web3 to replay these conditions. One of the reasons why this has been the case is that many funding models follow a “just throw money at it” logic. We saw an echo of this when initial coin offerings became popular.  However, successful Web2 incubator programs improve the odds of their projects by taking a different approach. Besides being very selective, they offer teams an integrated support system that goes beyond an initial investment. They help these projects become the best version of themselves, so to speak.  The right funding for BUIDLers  This hands-on kind of funding model is even better suited to an inherently more collaborative environment like the one that exists in Web3. The projects that need funding now usually work on open-source codebases, are composable with other projects and often rely on their own users to be investors at the same time.  “Most startups fail” is a popular Web2 mantra, but it’s not necessary for Web3 to replay these conditions  Proper coaching and support is more necessary than ever precisely because of the experimental, interconnected and fast-paced nature of the space. Builders need as much help as they can get when it comes to the how-to knowledge and network effects needed to get a project off the ground.  This is especially true in an industry where timing makes all the difference and not all challenges are solvable by just adding more funds to a project's treasury.  What should a Web3 funding program look like?  Ideally, we should be equipping builders with the right tools that will help them jump through the hoops faster as they work on their projects. Setting the right context is also crucial.  Web3 funding programs should make sure their candidates are set up for success by supporting them on a number of different ends besides funding. Some of these would be:  Compliance  Regulations for cryptocurrencies and Web3 services in general are still evolving. This makes it hard for new projects to navigate the legal implications of what their products and services might offer.  Funding programs can ensure that builders are setting up their operations in ways that are compliant with regulations and avoid any setbacks in the future. They can host legal and operational workshops with partner firms to ensure that projects start and stay on the right side of the law.  Auditing  Security and robustness are of special importance in Web3. A simple mistake in smart contract code can represent the loss of millions in user funds, as has been the case many times in the past.  Assisting development teams with professional code auditing services saves them a lot of time (and funds, potentially). Funding programs could provide builders with a holistic approach to cybersecurity that guides them through all stages of their development process.  Technical decisions  Some technical details – such as working in the right ecosystem, for example – can determine the course of a project's development. Teams can either fail or succeed depending on the network they choose to build on, the frameworks they use, the collaboration tools they rely on, and the functionalities that they’ll find therein.  Deciding what the right stack is for their project is often the first order of business because it determines the tools that they have at their disposal. For some projects this means looking for web assembly (WASM)-compatibility, for others, maybe it’s about having privacy enhancements built into the ecosystem. These are all choices where funding programs can provide much needed guidance.  Infrastructure support  Likewise, Web3 doesn’t exist in a vacuum. We still rely on existing infrastructure that, in many cases, goes beyond the choice of a blockchain network. Projects often need help with the costs of hosting their front ends on Web2 service providers, connecting their dapps to existing fiat on-ramps and payment services, or even negotiating their business relationships with key partners.  Final thoughts  These are not the only ways in which funding programs can improve the odds of success for builders in their ecosystems beyond funding. There are other important ways in which they can provide support including marketing services, community support and product management.

The initial drop of the NFTs in 2022 raised roughly $5 million. Friendswithyou, the LA-based art duo who developed the NFT project, also made their Twitter account private after the announcement.  The project behind the popular collection, featuring whimsical avatars, said on Twitter on Monday night it would pause developing the collection, citing market conditions as the catalyst for the collection’s hiatus.  “We had the best intentions to make a true digital companion for the future,” Friendsies said on Twitter. “However, the volatility and challenges of the market have made it very difficult to move this project forward in a way we can be proud of.”  According to Friendsies' website, the project set out to mint 10,000 Friendsies, partnering with auction house Christie’s in March, 2022 to sell nine early-access mint passes to the collection on secondary marketplace OpenSea to help enthusiastic collectors mint the rarest Friendsies.  Shortly after the collection's tweet, users who replied with questions found their accounts blocked and not long after that, Friendsies deleted their Twitter account. Twitter users also pointed fingers at Farokh, host of Web3 show Rug Radio, and generative artist Jen Stark and who both hyped the collection on Twitter in its early days.  According to data from OpenSea, the collection’s floor price is currently 0.011 ETH, or about $18, with a trading volume of 3,774 ETH or about $6.3 million. When the collection’s mint kicked off, its Dutch auction opened with a starting price of 3.33 ETH, which at the time was about $12,000 per token.  Friendsies had big ambitions from the start – according to a Discord post, the collection set out to allow holders to access a play-to-earn game. It also laid out plans for a community treasury and upcoming blueprint to expand the brand’s IP – none of which came to fruition.

42412821,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6PoQ,1676995590,"Sequoia, Multicoin Lead $6M Round for Crypto Startup TipLink","TipLink, a startup building technology that allows users to send crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT) with a link, has raised $6 million in a seed funding round led by Sequoia Capital and Multicoin Capital. The announcement comes as infrastructure projects have been able to partially stave off the effects of crypto winter on fundraising.  TipLink is intended to enable users to send crypto through a link that also acts as the wallet, meaning the user doesn’t need to know anything about crypto to receive the assets. Those assets can then be withdrawn to an existing crypto wallet or, eventually, to their financial institution. Companies can utilize TipLink to host giveaways using crypto without asking for the public keys of user wallets and can give away tokens at events using a scannable QR code. TipLink offers an application programming interface (API) that allows developers to create TipLinks for free and add any asset.  ""There's still a tremendous amount of friction in crypto that holds back mainstream adoption. It's unreasonable to ask the general population to set up a 12- or 24-word seed phrase wallet, much less a hardware wallet, just to send a dollar or receive a commemorative NFT,” said TipLink founder and CEO Ian Krotinsky in the press release. “TipLink solves one of the biggest problems in crypto: how to send digital assets in a frictionless way.""  Investors in the round also included Asymmetric, Big Brain Ventures, Circle Ventures, Karatage, Monke Ventures, Paxos, and Solana Ventures, among others.  “As people who live and breathe crypto every day, we take for granted that users know what public and private keys are, how hot wallets and seed phrases work, how to secure assets, how to transfer NFTs, etc.,” wrote Multicoin Capital principal Spencer Applebaum and partner John Robert Reed in a blog post detailing the TipLink investment. “Wallets based on multi-party computation (MPC) such as Web3Auth and mobile apps with native social recovery have made strides in reducing barriers to entry. But in addition to Web3Auth and mobile wallets, we need tools designed for mainstream users that know absolutely nothing about crypto.”  Read more: What Are VCs Funding After FTX?

42421377,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuIP,1676993692,"I’m American, but My Crypto Startup Won’t Be","Yes, bear markets are for BUIDLing in crypto. Yes, I am bullish on 2023 being the year more builders start to impact the real world through the growing interest in bringing real world assets (RWA) on-chain and, importantly, the explosion of interest and projects in the regenerative finance (ReFi) space.  Yet, I am extremely bearish on the U.S. as a place for builders to launch crypto projects, especially if there is or could be a token tied to their business.  While jurisdictions such as Dubai are bringing regulatory clarity and direct support for builders to set up shop in this crypto oasis, the U.S. remains an outlier in embracing regulation through enforcement. This has been true for years when it comes to the never-ending question about whether and which tokens should be classified as a security or a commodity. Obviously, if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler had his way, everything in crypto would be a security by default, and he would have the power to be judge, jury and executioner.  Read more: Boyd Cohen is CEO and co-founder of Iomob, the developers of WheelCoin, a Move2Earn game that rewards users for moving green. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Buidl Week.  Instead of regulatory certainty that creates predictability and the ability for the crypto ecosystem to move forward knowing it is operating within the bounds of legality, the U.S. for far too long has opted for scare tactics through threats and fines in the absence of well-defined regulation.  There are many in Congress – including Senator Cynthia Lummis and members of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, such as Representatives Tom Emmer and Bill Foster – who actually understand the consequences of inaction. They see that this lack of regulatory clarity poses a fundamental risk of the U.S. being entirely left behind as crypto rails become more ubiquitous and adopted by every industry in the world.  Yet, the failure of Congress to act has left a regulatory vacuum that Gensler has managed to capitalize on. In the latest stunner, the SEC has forced Kraken to shut down its staking business in the U.S. – representing 10% of its annual revenue – and pay a $30 million fine because, apparently, the SEC, or at least Gensler, has decided to yet again place a heavy hand on a centralized and highly regulated U.S. exchange.  As countless industry experts have noted, it is ironic that companies like Kraken and Coinbase, which have been operating legally in the U.S. for years and are in compliance with every law that was knowingly applied to them, are so frequently the subject of the ire of the SEC. The result has been that fraudulent companies and actors like Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX succeed by moving offshore where they are out of reach of all U.S. regulators (and the SEC’s regulation by enforcement).  Let me ask you this. If you were a founder considering where to set up your legitimate crypto business, and you had the world to choose from, why would you even put the U.S. in your Top 10 places to consider?  I can tell you from firsthand experience, as a crypto founder myself, every single lawyer we have met with has advised us against considering the U.S. due to the regulatory uncertainty. And of course when crypto companies outside the U.S. decide to participate in token generation, they are always advised to leverage know-your-customer (KYC) processes to avoid directly selling tokens to the U.S. No one really knows what constitutes a security in the U.S. crypto space. So this creates difficulties for builders everywhere in the world as they deploy tokens but try to avoid the wrath of the SEC, not because the founders aim to be fraudulent or intentionally sell securities to U.S. retail investors, but because no one actually knows what the U.S. regulators or even the SEC actually consider a security, given the well-documented challenges of applying the Howey test to digital assets on crypto rails.  My own company is in the process of evaluating where to incorporate our token-generating entity and, yes, Dubai is now very high on our list, along with Singapore, Switzerland, the U.K. and other jurisdictions that have much clearer regulations for token issuers. Meanwhile, there is no jurisdiction in the U.S. that would make sense for us to consider, despite my being an American citizen, and our project already having ecosystem participants in the U.S.  The U.S., historically the birthplace of venture capital and global innovation, better get its act together soon and develop regulation by rules that all builders can transparently adhere to. If not the country, and its innovation ecosystem, is in great peril of losing the best and the brightest to emerging crypto hubs the world over who have recognized the need, and acted, to create regulatory certainty.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Boyd Cohen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/21/why-i-wont-build-in-the-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/401734f8373099054c9ab8587c89caed24e20a46-1536x1024.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393903,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc35R,1676989880,Crypto and Bitcoin Miners Rebrand and Diversify to Survive: A Look at Their New Strategies,"Bitcoin miners are trying to survive an icy crypto winter by broadening the scope of their business, both in name and in practice.  On Jan. 4, one of the biggest publicly traded bitcoin mining firms announced that it was swapping the “Blockchain” out of its name for “Platforms."" The rebranding to Riot Platforms (RIOT) was to “underpin” an “increasingly diversified business.”  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.”  It is not the only firm making a name change. In the past year, miners have worked to diversify their revenue streams into other products and services using energy-intensive data centers. Some did so in response to brutal market conditions while others took steps to prepare for a downturn when business was still going strong.  The strategy is the opposite of what we’ve seen in past bull markets, where publicly traded firms would add the word “crypto” or “blockchain” to their names and see their shares surge more than 100% in a day – even if the company had no viable crypto-related business plan.  Now, “There's a general desire by companies to distance themselves from the crypto bubble of the last couple years,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Chris Brendler. “It makes it easier when you're dealing with more traditional finance institutions.”  Exactly how much of this wave of corporate rebranding and promises of new business lines is just talk to pump stock valuations in a depressed market, and whether it will last, is yet to be determined. It depends on how profitable it will be to diversify.  “As we saw in the last bear market, many miners are pivoting their public narratives as a diversified business so that they don’t face solely the struggling mining valuations,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer of mining services firm Luxor Technologies.  Finite revenue from bitcoin mining  Just like traditional commodities, bitcoin mining is an extremely competitive and capital-intensive business, with miners competing for an asset that is limited in quantity.  There are only about 2 million more bitcoins that can be mined until the Bitcoin network reaches a cap of 21 million. Assuming the current bitcoin price of $25,000 per token, the total value of bitcoin to be mined works out to about $50 billion. That amount is “super finite,” said Lucas Pipes, an analyst at investment bank B. Riley Financial.  With many miners adding constant computing power to mine the limited amount of bitcoin, basing a whole business model on mining alone may not be viable. So companies are looking to repurpose some of their computing power for other industries and services. This includes selling “high-performance computing” to firms in industries like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.  Others are looking to capitalize on energy markets, either by owning their own assets or selling energy back to the grid.  “If you want to have a market cap of $50 billion – and what good CEO doesn't want to have a [high] market cap...you need to do something else as well,” Pipes said.  See also: What Will It Take for Bitcoin Mining Companies to Survive in 2023  However, many strategies miners are implementing to diversify could do more harm than good. High-performance computing services take away from their core business, according to D.A. Davison’s Brendler.  Brendler thinks miners are probably better off just focusing on mining bitcoin, instead of entering a new sector and taking on clients that need high-powered computing and compete against established tech firms such as Amazon and Microsoft. And what about miners trying to sell energy to the grid? That’s just another “sign of the [difficult] times,” he said.  The energy play  One of the ways miners are diversifying their revenue is by leveraging their high energy consumption and close ties to power grids.  Riot, for instance, acquired an electrical engineering company last year to service its mega-mine in Texas called Whinstone. It's now offering similar services to other companies. Though gross margins from this new business (around 10%) were far shorter than its mining operations (about 59%, before applying power credits) for the first nine months of 2022, it could be an area of growth before including power credits, according to the company’s third-quarter earnings report.  Meanwhile, Riot also gained $21.3 million in power credits in nine months ending Sept. 30 by shutting down its operations to redirect energy back to the Texas grid, according to its third-quarter report.  The strategy is not an attempt to pivot away from its mining business, but to gain more control over costs and turn them into a revenue stream, Riot CEO Jason Les said. “We have a vertically integrated strategy for our bitcoin mining focus, and with that strategy we are focused on taking more control of our inputs and turning expenses into revenues.”  Competitors Greenidge Generation (GREE) and Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) also own fossil fuel-based power generators and sell power back to the grid.  However, both firms saw their gross margins for their power segments dramatically decrease through 2022, well into negative territory. Greenidge ended the third quarter with a gross margin of -4%, whereas Stronghold ended with -72% when including maintenance costs, according to data by The MinerMag Head of Research Wolfie Zhao.  See also: Bitcoin Mining: A Positive or Negative Indicator for the Future of Crypto  Greenidge's support services segment, which offers “customer service, sales support and technical support,” has proved the most profitable, with a gross margin over 50% versus mining margin of about 42%, according to the firm’s quarterly report.  The high-performance computing play  Miners entering the high-performance computing market are essentially hitching the wagon on a “mega-trend that should last for many years,” B. Riley’s Pipe said.  Bitcoin miners are uniquely positioned to compete in high-performance computing as most of them already have data centers and have access to low-cost power, said Luxor’s Vera.  However, the high-performance computing market is very competitive and miners lack the infrastructure and capabilities of already established data center operators. The computing industry is “a business geared to face customers,” Vera said, and many bitcoin miners don’t exactly have sales divisions.  In early 2022, Canadian mining company Hut 8 Mining (HUT) bought five data centers from TeraGo for about $22 million, which had grown to 14% of its revenue by the end of the third quarter. That’s more than its mining hosting business was bringing in quarterly last year.  Read more: Hut 8’s Data Center Deal Will Set It Apart From Peers, Analyst Says  Diversifying into the wider world of “compute” is essentially catching a “rising tide” B. Riley’s Pipe said. The industry may ebb and flow, and it might be riskier depending on the clientele, but overall it’s a growing sector.  Zhao estimates that gross margin for Hut 8’s high-performance computing segment has remained around 50% through 2022, while its mining margin dropped to 34% in Q3. For comparison, operating margins for major computing firms such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are reportedly in the 25%-40% range.  See also: Shares of Bitcoin Miner Hut 8 Slump on Merger With US Bitcoin Corp.  Time for a blockchain rebrand  Similar to Riot, Applied Digital Corporation (APLD) dropped the “blockchain” from its name. This was “to distinguish that its next-generation data centers support many other high-performance computing applications as well,” said its press release at the time.  The firm has yet to bring in revenue from high-performance computing applications but targets 10% of gross revenue by the end of 2023 from that segment, CEO Wes Cummins told CoinDesk. The gross margin for high-performance computing is higher than mining, Cummins said.  For now, APLD hosts 128 graphics processing units (GPU) “retrofitted portion of an existing building in Jamestown [North Dakota] for Web3 applications,” and has plans to pilot hosting another 300 GPUs for machine learning in the first quarter of 2023. The 300 GPUs will be in a 5 megawatt (MW) facility dedicated to GPUs that broke ground in December 2022.  These contracts are tiny compared to the 185 MW of long-term crypto mining hosting contracts the firm had signed as of October, or the 276 MW it has signed to host for Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), or the 100 MW “dedicated blockchain power facility” it runs in Jamestown.  Canadian miner Hive Blockchain (HIVE) has been preparing to launch cloud services for high-performance computing since the Ethereum Merge effectively dismantled its Ether mining business. The Merge upgraded the blockchain’s proof-of-work backbone in favor of a less intensive proof-of-stake algorithm.  The cloud offering is 25 times more profitable than mining, when measured in dollars per electricity consumption, given current market conditions, has an annual revenue of $1 million on a run-rate basis, the company said on Tuesday. Hive has a fleet of 38,000 GPUs and is currently using 450 of those for its cloud proof of concept, which consume about 80 kilowatts (KW) to make $3,500 per day.  See also: Bitcoin Miners Need Ethereum As Well | Opinion  Hive has also deployed some of these GPUs to mine other coins, which it later converts into bitcoin. In January, only 6% of Hive’s computing power came from alt-coin mining, as its GPU fleet was curtailed to sell energy back to the grid, which totalled $180,000 for the month. In the quarter prior to the Merge, ending June 30, 2022, 11% of Hive’s revenue came from Ethereum and Ethereum Classic mining.  Hive has also been selling energy back to the grid at times of high demand since. In December 2022, it made $3.15 million from selling power back to the grid.  For Brendler, miners could find a niche in the high-performance computing space, but given competition with large players it will never be a major trend.  “It could have been a bigger trend if the market had been stronger. But now that we're in survival mode,” it’s unlikely we’ll see more expansion plans, Brendler said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/21/bitcoincrypto-miners-diversifying-amid-icy-winter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f1edb0a547c81239e492cf7970c92989e22d03b-1800x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This is a particularly tough comparison to draw, with one year representing the end of a record-setting bull market – the calm before a series of crypto scandals – and the other following the collapse of multibillion-dollar centralized crypto exchange FTX, a series of high-profile bankruptcies and the implosion of a systemically important stablecoin called UST.  This article is part of CoinDesk's BUIDL Week.  In the post-FTX investment landscape, deal paces have slowed and startup valuations have fallen back to Earth. However, venture capitalists CoinDesk interviewed largely agree on a number of crypto verticals of interest – and those don’t include centralized finance players.  Infrastructure by any name  Infrastructure remained the most stable investment vertical in January, with the broad term referring to multiple facets of the crypto world. This can range from inter-blockchain portals to on-chain wallets – and includes any software innovations that will make static digital identities feasible, non-fungible tokens useful and decentralized autonomous organizations real competitors to corporations and governments.  Crypto-focused investment firm Multicoin Capital was among those caught with exposure to FTX when the exchange suspended withdrawals in November, but the collapse has only strengthened the firm’s investment resolve, co-founder and managing partner Kyle Samani told CoinDesk in an email, noting that decentralized finance (DeFi) “performed beautifully throughout the volatility.”  “We’re particularly interested in proof-of-physical-work networks,” said Samani, referencing projects such as Multicoin portfolio company Helium, which incentivizes people to build physical telecommunications networks. “The network design has matured to a point where others can stand on the shoulders of the first movers.”  See also: Crypto Winter Led to 91% Plunge in VC and Other Investments  Generalist Web3 fund Shima Capital, an active firm that has the backing of hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, is particularly interested in consumer and infrastructure projects, general partner Yida Gao told CoinDesk in an email.  “We have a strong thesis around how gaming will bring forth the next wave of crypto users,” he said. This is includes building the floors that will support that heavy flow of newcomers, like industry-specific chains, which can put data-heavy computer games on-chain and foster economies for in-game assets, as well as new network protocols like account abstraction, a proposed way to rewrite how smart contracts work to allow for new capabilities like asset recovery, stable user identities and fraud protection systems.  “[T]here are currently promising opportunities to back founders building for this massive market both at the consumer and infrastructure levels of the Web3 stack,” said Gao. For consumers, he mentioned investing capital in game design studios, which may attract new crypto users with what they build, and time developing intellectual property standards, which is alluring for what it allows users to build.  Regulation-resistant investments  The misdeeds of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives have increased the calls for stricter crypto regulation in the United States, which puts many startups in murky legal territory. That’s why Tribe Capital, another active investor last month, prefers to focus on so-called decentralized, censorship-resistant protocols.  See also: Crypto Layoffs: Here's the Grim Count Since April  “Government regulations are a form of censorship, whether they’re valid or not,” explained Tribe managing partner Boris Revsin, who joined the firm in July. “Protocols that are global in nature – meaning not necessarily based in or serving the United States – have a stronger narrative and a stronger go-to-market plan, because they’re not as impaired by the uncertainty that’s been created by U.S. regulators.”  Whether it’s tools for consumer-facing apps, infrastructure for industries to build on or the legal code in which everything is embedded, 2023 is a year for building.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/21/what-are-vcs-funding-after-ftx-more-decentralized-infrastructure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da7ce6b85f78acf02efd77590270080b6c00a012-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412826,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6PrE,1676989394,Paxos Is Holding 'Constructive Discussions' With SEC,"Stablecoin issuer Paxos is having a ""constructive discussion"" with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Chief Executive Officer Charles Cascarilla told the company over the weekend.  The note surfaced a week after Paxos acknowledged receiving a Wells Notice from the SEC. A Wells Notice is a tool used by the SEC to allege certain activity may be a violation of federal securities law, and may indicate the SEC intends to sue.  Paxos' notice was tied to the company's issuance of Binance USD (BUSD), a branded stablecoin product. The Pax dollar (USDP), the company's own stablecoin product, was not included. Paxos has already announced it will stop issuing BUSD after receiving a notice from the New York Department of Financial Services, the state regulator overseeing it.  Since the introduction of BUSD in 2019, ""the market has evolved and the Binance relationship no longer aligns with our current strategic priorities,"" Cascarilla said in the note. ""We announced on Monday that we're ending the relationship with Binance.""  Since announcing the halt in issuance, Paxos has facilitated more than $2.8 billion in BUSD redemptions with no significant market disruptions, he said.  The SEC has been accelerating its crackdown on crypto companies the agency believes are violating federal law. In the last few weeks, it's settled charges that Kraken's staking services product was an unregistered securities offering; settled charges with National Basketball Association Hall of Famer Paul Pierce alleging he didn't disclose being paid to promote a token; and sued Gemini, Genesis and Terraform Labs (Genesis and CoinDesk share a parent company in Digital Currency Group).  Paxos, meantime, is working with regulators to enhance its standing.  ""We are working with the SEC towards the publication of our Clearing Agency application,"" Cascarilla wrote. ""We are working with the OCC to move our conditional approval into an operationalized and launched National Trust. We are also working to expand our Singapore products in consultation with the MAS following our Payment Service Provider approval last year. We continue to pursue each of these plus any other opportunities for productive collaboration with regulators.""  Cascarilla's note was according reported earlier by Reuters.

The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approved a virtual currency license – known as a BitLicense – for the platform’s eToro NY LLC subsidiary along with a money transmitter license. Together, the two will allow users in the state to access eToro’s “virtual portfolio, integrated social investing tools and be able to trade stocks, crypto and options” once the platform is operational.  Including eToro, the NYDFS now regulates 33 entities under the BitLicense, which was set up in 2015. The regulator has faced heavy criticism from the crypto industry over restrictive measures, high compliance costs and in some cases, long wait times.  Crypto firm Coin Cafe, for example, secured a BitLicense in January; the firm had applied for one in August 2015. Prior to that, PayPal was the last to convert conditional approval into a full BitLicense, in June 2022.  Securing the New York licenses is a “key milestone” in the company’s expansion across the U.S., eToro co-founder and CEO Yoni Assia said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.  The company already has a presence in the country. EToro USA Securities Inc. is a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, while eToro USA LLC is registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a Money Services Business, according to its website.

The startup is building a full suite of systems focusing on blockchain interoperability, scalability and privacy. Protocols and offerings have included a zkBridge that supports cross-chain asset and data transfers, a decentralized identity solution for zero-knowledge credential verification, and the paraPlonk scalability solution that accelerates zk-rollups, which bundle transactions for better speed and lower fees.  On the near-term road map, Polyhedra Network plans to integrate its bridge and decentralized identity infrastructure with additional blockchain networks, and to launch application programming interfaces (API) and software development kits (SDK) for developers.

42412836,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6Q2S,1676986972,Crypto Analysts Scramble to Explain Bitcoin's Pause Near $25K,"Bitcoin's (BTC) upswing has come to a screeching halt at a price level that proved to be a tough nut to crack last year.  The leading cryptocurrency by market cap picked up a strong bid at the start of the year and has gained nearly 50% since then, outperforming major traditional risk assets. However, the bullish momentum has stalled since Feb. 16, with the cryptocurrency failing multiple times to secure a foothold above the $25,000 mark. The said level offered stiff resistance in August, following which the cryptocurrency revisited lows around $18,000.  According to Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, a breakout above $25,000 hinges on the performance of technology companies.  ""Tech firms performed horrendously last year, and it's all down to how well they recover in the first quarter. That's why BTC is not pushing further,"" Kssis told CoinDesk. Technology stocks will announce the first-quarter earnings after March.  Bitcoin tends to move in synch with Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index. Recently, the 90-day correlation coefficient between the two strengthened to 0.75. Nasdaq fell by 2.4% last week, pausing a four-week winning streak that offered positive cues to high-risk assets like bitcoin.  Kssis added that crypto traders are currently parking money in world's biggest dollar-pegged stablecoin tether (USDT) and the bitcoin rally will resume once that trend ends.  ""The market is patiently awaiting realized profits that are parked in USDT right now to pile back into bitcoin and ether. This is why we ran out of breath to break $25,000,"" Kssis said. ""When BTC is rallying, USDT dominance tends to thin out.""  Data from charting platform TradingView show, tether's dominance, or the stablecoin's share of the total crypto market valuation, has steadied around 6.5% since late January, a sign of traders rotating money into the stablecoin, as Kssis said. USDT's dominance fell from nearly 9% to 6.5% in January as bitcoin rallied.  According to Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, heightened regulatory risks have dented sentiment in the market, and ""volatility is unlikely to go away.""  Last week, the U.S. regulatory agencies specifically called out Paxos for its BUSD product and not Pax dollar, hinting at an indirect action against Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes. BUSD is a Binance-branded dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Paxos.  Since then, long-term and short-term call-put skews have retreated to zero, indicating a neutral sentiment in the options market. Call-put skews measure the cost of bullish call options relative to bearish put options and are widely tracked to gauge sentiment among sophisticated institutional players and retail investors.  ""The options market had been demonstrating bullish leanings but now maintain a neutral outlook on the market,"" analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex said in a report shared with CoinDesk. ""Investors now place roughly equal value on put and call options.""  Besides, there is evidence of investors pulling money out of crypto funds. Per data tracked by CoinShares, digital asset investment products saw outflows totaling $32 million last week, the largest since late December 2022. Bitcoin funds alone bled nearly $25 million, while short bitcoin funds saw an inflow of $3.7 million.  Griffin Blofin, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said concerns about sticky inflation have resurfaced since last week, stalling the rally in risk assets.  ""The expectation of an inflation rebound has appeared in many markets. Both the U.S. January CPI and the latest U.K. PMI data point to a relatively strong economy, raising the possibility of a resurgence of overheating. The above means that the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank must maintain a hawkish policy and even return to the pace of each interest rate hike of 50 basis points,"" Ardern told CoinDesk.  At press time, the fed funds futures show a 15% chance of the central bank lifting rates by 50 basis points next month, while in Europe, a similar-sized hike in March is all but priced in.  Meanwhile, bitcoin changed hands at $24,650. Some market participants expect a potential breakout above the technical resistance at $25,000 to bring a sharp rally.  ""We have tested the 25k resistance multiple times over the past week and failed.

The withdrawal process ""may take some time"" if a sizable number of requests take hold from customers, the statement said. ""We will announce the resumption of other FTX Japan services as soon as possible."" In mid-January, FTX got the green light to start offloading four of its affiliates, including FTX Japan, as part of its effort to raise funds and repay customers. Financial Services provider Monex Group was said to have expressed interest in FTX Japan among more than 100 interested buyers.

The job cuts come at a time when the crypto industry is reeling from the impact of the FTX crypto exchange implosion and subsequent downturn.  ""Earlier this year, we consolidated multiple business units under Polygon Labs. As part of this process, we’re sharing the difficult news that we’ve reduced our team by 20% impacting multiple teams and about 100 positions,"" the company said in a release.  The cuts affect employees mostly in the U.S., Canada and India where most of Polygon's workforce is located, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk.  ""Momentarily, your access to Polygon Labs' systems, including Slack and email will end; the abrupt nature is a necessary security measure,"" read an email to a laid-off employee viewed by CoinDesk.  The native token of Polygon MATIC was down over 5% on the day at $1.42.  Company co-founder Sandeep Nailwal tweeted to say that he would be joining the company's weekly Community call on Discord on Wednesday to ""address any doubts any community members might have.""  ""The treasury remains healthy, with a balance of more than $250 million and more than 1.9 billion MATIC, and we have crystallized our strategy for the next several years to help drive mass adoption of Web3 by scaling Ethereum,"" Nailwal said.  While Nailwal has included the phrase ""Top 3 by impact"" in his Twitter profile – an apparent comparison with Binance and Ethereum – the complete picture of how the 2022 crypto contagion impacted Polygon remains unclear.  The collapse of FTX, in part, had seen users move funds resulting in wild swings in daily transactions on Polygon during the fourth quarter. There was also a tremendous addition of daily addresses on Polygon at the time, partly due to the launch of its zero-knowledge EVM (zkEVM) public testnet. The zkEVM beta main network is set to go live on March 27, per a recent announcement.  In Jan. 2022, Nailwal announced he would be returning $100 million USDC that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had previously sent to Nailwal's initiative for Indian COVID-19 relief efforts. Buterin would be able to use the funds in a more accelerated way, said Nailwal, because he – as a nonresident Indian citizen – had to be extra cautious to be in full compliance with Indian jurisdiction.

The distressed asset fund managers doing so are projecting around a 50 cents on the dollar recovery in five years, an anonymous FTX creditor told CoinDesk. Most of the deals are private as not all claims are fungible. ""There may also be a clawback period for those who tried to withdraw leading up to the bankruptcy, so the quality of claims is important,"" the source said. FTX, which went bankrupt in November, has an estimated 1 million creditors, with the 50 largest being owed a combined $3.1 billion.  Factor, the decentralized digital asset management platform built on Ethereum scaler Arbitrum, attracted over $4.3 million in trades in the first 12 hours after going live. Factor’s aim is to allow developers to be able to offer tokenized baskets, yield pools or derivative offerings to community users. Depositors to these products will profit from the upside created by those developers, who themselves earn a cut of fees. The initial coin offering for Factor’s FCTR token started with a $10 million target and will last for three more days, after which the resulting pool of money will be distributed to determine the initial price of FCTR in the open market.  The Litecoin network has effectively gotten its first non-fungible token (NFT) after a copy of its mimblewimble upgrade was placed on the platform’s blockchain. Bitcoin developer Anthony Gurrera forked the code behind Bitcoin ordinals to the Litecoin network, answering a challenge from a Twitter user who offered a public bounty of 15 LTC ($1,410) to the first party to fork Ordinals to Litecoin. Ordinals Protocol has recently enabled Bitcoin-based NFTs by allowing users to inscribe references to digital art into small denominations of BTC.  Chart of the Day  The chart by Kaiko shows daily trading volumes on centralized Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and dominant decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap since early January.  Coinbase has seen more than $185 billion in trading volume so far this year. That's nearly double of Uniswap's tally of $93 billion.  The data dents the narrative that crypto traders are increasingly flocking to decentralized platforms in the wake of FTX's collapse.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  CoinDesk Wins a Polk Award, One of Journalism's Top Prizes, for Explosive FTX Coverage  How Hong Kong Is Gearing Up to Regulate Stablecoins  Crypto Miner Hive Blockchain's Posts Q3 Loss as Ethereum Merge Cuts Revenue, Mining Margin",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | LTC,BTC | ETH | LTC | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,"Jamie Crawley, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/21/first-mover-americas-lido-daos-governance-token-jumps-17,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3968c542cd2b9c5e0d8822de1b8b5667fcb2735e-4800x2700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ), during the same period, plunged 46%. Investors' fear of roiling crypto markets is sure to show up in the crypto exchange's Q4 results, set to be released on Tuesday after the closing bell. The cryptocurrency exchange is expected to post Q4 loss per share of $1.41, narrower than its $2.38 loss per share in Q3 but far worse than Q4 2021, when it had EPS of $3.32. The average analyst estimate for Q4 2022 revenue of $586.3M compares with $590.3M in Q3 and $2.49B in the year-ago quarter. In the six quarters that Coinbase ( COIN ) has been a publicly traded company, its earnings have missed the Wall Street consensus twice and its revenue has fallen short four times. While trading volumes for the quarter are largely known, D.A. Davidson Christopher Brendler is concerned about Coinbase's ( COIN ) assets under management, especially on the institutional side, after the FTX bankruptcy. He has also tempered his expectations on interest, which ""still should be a big positive,"" as stablecoin balances are dropping and AUM declined. ""Combined, we think 4Q and 2023 guidance are likely to disappoint, and we see little risk of the stock getting away from us at least around earnings,"" the analyst wrote last week in a note that downgraded Coinbase ( COIN ) to Neutral.

Hundreds of such tokens have been issued in the past few weeks. Of this, 132 different tokens have been issued on BNB Chain, 25 tokens on Ethereum and 10 separate tokens on other blockchains such as Solana, Arbitrum, OKChain and Cronos.  These fake issuances follow software giant Microsoft’s move to integrate OpenAI’s chatbots for search services on Microsoft’s internet browsers.  While OpenAI is the creator of ChatGPT, Microsoft’s own chatbot is a bespoke tool and is said to be an improvement over the publicly accessible ChatGPT.  Scammers are not wasting a chance to monetize on the hype, however. Several “BingChatGPT” have been issued, seeded with liquidity and are seeing thousands of dollars in trading volumes – despite red flags.  “PeckShield has detected dozens of newly created #BingChatGPT tokens, of which 3 appear to be #honeypots & 2 have high sell tax,” blockchain security firm PeckShield said in a tweet Monday.  “2 of them have already dropped over -99%. Deployer 0xb583 has already created dozens of tokens with a pump & dump scheme,” PeckShield added, referring to the wallet address of the nefarious issuer of these tokens.  In cryptocurrency, honeypots are smart contracts that pretend to leak their funds to an arbitrary user, provided that the user sends additional funds to it.  On the other hand, sales tax refers to the intentional amount of money taken by an illicit smart contract when a related token is sold – usually amounts higher than 50%, meaning a user selling $100 worth of a token receives only $50 worth, with the remaining “taxed” amount going to the developer of that smart contact.  At writing time on Tuesday, there are over 170 ChatGPT-branded tokens issued on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap, data from DEXTools shows.

42388040,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR2Old,1676976279,BNB-Bitcoin Ratio Drops to Lowest Level in Six Months on Paxos-BUSD Drama,"BNB, the native token of the Binance-initiated blockchain network BNB Chain, is losing ground against bitcoin (BTC) in the wake of regulatory action against Binance-branded dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD.  The BNB/BTC ratio listed on Binance, the world's largest exchange by trading volume, slipped to 0.01257 early Tuesday, reaching the lowest since Aug. 2, 2022.  The pair has declined by nearly 13% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said last Tuesday that it is suing Paxos for violating investor protection laws by issuing BUSD, which the regulator deems as an unregistered security. The SEC action was accompanied by an order from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) asking Paxos to stop minting BUSD.  ""BNB token has underperformed the broad market in February as the Paxos-BUSD situation continues to weigh on the exchange, which experienced massive outflows last week,"" Paris-based Kaiko said in a weekly report. ""The BNB to BTC price ratio, which measures the relative performance of the two tokens, fell to its lowest level since August 2022.""  The flow of money out of BNB, once touted as a safe haven, and into bitcoin perhaps stems from the belief that the regulatory crackdown against BUSD is actually a move against Binance.  While BUSD is issued and redeemed by Paxos, the stablecoin is marketed by Binance. In September, Binance delisted USD coin (USDC), Paxos dollar (USDP) and trueUSD (TUSD) for BUSD.  ""Since the NYDFS and SEC specifically called out Paxos for its BUSD product and not Pax dollar, it’s possible that the enforcement is more about particulars involving BUSD than a broad attack on stablecoins generally,"" Galaxy Research's Alex Thorn said in a note to clients on Friday. ""This indicates that these agencies are particularly targeting Binance rather than stablecoins in general – at least at this time.""  If that's not enough, the move by SEC and NYDFS aligns with Binance's recent decision to suspend dollar transfers and its admission of gaps in regulatory compliance. The exchange is now expecting fines for past misconduct.  The ratio peaked in November as the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's exchange brought increased scrutiny to Binance and other crypto exchanges.  ""BNB had mostly outperformed BTC until November 2022, when the ratio started trending downwards as sentiment deteriorated following the collapse of FTX,"" Kaiko said, adding that the token can be interpreted as a proxy of the exchange's performance.  Per some observers, BNB/BTC's slide represents peak pessimism, often observed at market bottoms.  ""Buying BNB here. Think we're close to peak FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt] and the BNB/BTC ratio shows it,"" crypto hedge fund Ouroboros Capital said in a tweet thread last week, drawing attention to Binance's increasing market share and growing BNB Chain ecosystem.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/21/bnb-bitcoin-ratio-drops-to-lowest-since-august,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e6e2b2ccc1b699c9238fb1786dc7756f044158e-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42388035,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR2OSv,1676975937,"Crypto Miner Hive Blockchain Posts Q3 Loss as Ethereum Merge Cuts Revenue, Mining Margin","Crypto mining firm Hive Blockchain (HIVE) slid to a fiscal third quarter loss as the Ethereum blockchain's switch to proof-of-stake validation cut its revenue and gross mining margin by about 50%.  The Vancouver-based firm reported a net loss of US$90 million, or $1.09 a share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with profit of US$51.2 million, or 66 cents a share, the year before, it said in a Tuesday release. It had a loss of US$37 million, or 45 cents per share, in the previous three months. The net was mainly attributed to impairment from depreciation of mining rigs and chips due to lower crypto currency prices, the statement said.  The last three months of 2022 was the first quarter Hive didn't mine any ether following Ethereum's Merge upgrade in September that ended the blockchain's proof-of-work validation method.  Hive's fiscal third quarter revenue was $14.1 million, fell about 52% from prior year mainly due to Ethereum's merge, higher global hashrate growth and lower cryptocurrency prices, according to the statement. Meanwhile, its gross mining margin was also affected by the falling crypto prices as it declined to $3.6 million or 25% of income from crypto mining versus $15.9 million, or 54% from the same period in the prior year.  ""HIVE has skillfully navigated the digital asset mining industry in a post-Ethereum merge, when many questioned how we could continue to generate profit from operations. This has been answered by our gross mining margins of $3.6 million this quarter, during a time when many other crypto miners are struggling for solvency,"" CEO of Hive Aydin Kilic, who took over Jan. 17, said in the statement.  Some of the ways Hive navigated the tough quarter is by using some of its graphics processing units (GPUs), formerly used to mine ether, to mine other crypto tokens that it then converts into bitcoin. Its post-Merge strategy also includes launching HIVE Performance Cloud, redirecting its GPUs to support high-performance computing workloads other than mining.  “This is an evolution of our skillset as a technology company and sets the stage for a new era in HIVE’s outlay of technology services,"" Kilic said. The company also sold energy back to the power grid and upgraded its mining machines to improved efficiency during the quarter, he added.  Read more: Ex-Ethereum Miners Token Hop to Stay Alive After the Merge  In current market conditions, the cloud segment is 25 times more profitable than mining when measuring in dollars per megawatt hour, or electricity consumption, Hive said Tuesday.

The broker says this could be a “critical fork in the road” for the cryptocurrency industry, which could lead to capital and talent moving to Asia as a crypto hub.  The SFC on Monday published its proposed rules for virtual asset trading platforms and is seeking public comment. It plans to allow retail investors access to licensed exchanges, subject to restrictions, the report said, reasoning that investors are better off dealing with licensed venues rather than offshore and unregulated players.  Trading in crypto derivatives remains off the table for now as the SFC has deferred the decision on allowing such instruments to a later point in time.  The new licensing regime is expected to go live June 1, with a 12-month transition period for existing crypto exchanges. Exchanges that are not already operating in Hong Kong will have to be fully compliant before they start trading.

Factor, which is offering 10 million FCTR tokens on Camelot, says its product will provide the middleware infrastructure that will allow developers to aggregate decentralized finance (DeFi) products and spin up on-chain asset management services.  Camelot is a suite of decentralized contracts built to support Arbitrum native builders, offering trading, initial coin issuance, and lending services to users and developers.  On Factor, developers will be able to create, manage and offer a combination of tokenized baskets, yield pools or derivative offerings to community users. Depositors to these Factor-created products will rake in the upside created by those developers, who earn a cut of fees in turn. This creates a win-win situation, at least in theory.  The initial coin offering for FCTR on Camelot started with a $10 million raise target for Factor, fixing a 10 cents floor price for FCTR, and has increased after the first $1 million was been raised. The tokens, which are currently non-tradable, are said to be in a price discovery phase as of Tuesday – where the token price will continuously increase at every purchase.  The raise will run on for three more days, after which the final pool of money will be equally distributed with the total number of issued tokens to determine the initial price of FCTR in the open market. In this manner, every participant will get FCTR tokens at the same final price.  The value accrual mechanism for Factor’s native FCTR tokens is creating hype, and value, for the tokens among traders.  Factor will take a percentage of the deposit, withdrawal, transaction, vault management, and performance fees and redistributes 50% to FCTR stakers, and 50% to its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  FCTR stakers will, therefore, earn yields on staking their tokens as liquidity to the platform, while the platform will use the increased liquidity to offer even more products to potential users.  At writing time on Tuesday, FCTR tokens have reached a total market capitalization of $14 million, giving each token a current value of 14 cents.  Meanwhile, some interested users are waiting out the initial days in favor of purchasing the tokens on the final offering day. “Surprised people are in so early.

Over the weekend, Bitcoin developer Anthony Gurrera forked the code behind Bitcoin Ordinals to the Litecoin blockchain – placing a copy of the latter’s mimblewimble upgrade white paper to the Litecoin network, making it the first NFT on Litecoin, in effect.  The effort likely stemmed from a public bounty of 15 litecoin (LTC) tokens by one Crypto Twitter user to any developer who could fork Ordinals to the Litecoin blockchain. “Rules: Must work with Litecoin Core 0.21.2.1.

42410828,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtuw,1676964195,How Hong Kong Is Gearing Up to Regulate Stablecoins,"At the end of January, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) indicated it may require firms to keep to their principal business and have a locally incorporated entity in Hong Kong if they want to obtain stablecoin licenses, according to its consultation conclusions.  The HKMA’s current stance is that stablecoins must be fully backed by high-quality liquid assets (which HKMA has yet to detail) and be redeemable to their referenced fiat currencies at par. Under this regime, algorithmic and arbitrage coins are effectively not allowed.  The collapse of Terraform Labs and the algorithmic UST stablecoin last year prompted regulators worldwide to focus on regulating stablecoins.  Stablecoin regulations in Hong Kong may be coming in as soon as this year. The proposed regime will cover entities if they actively market or operate in Hong Kong. It will also increase the number of licenses an issuer will need.  CoinDesk reached out to the HKMA to ask whether non-Hong Kong stablecoin issuers like Tether will be regulated under its upcoming regime.  A representative from the HKMA said that “regulatory treatment for different types of virtual assets would depend on, among other things, their actual structures and operational details.”  “We will continue our ongoing discussion with the industry with a view to adopting a risk-based, pragmatic and agile approach to regulate stablecoins,” the representative said, adding that the regulator will “conduct further consultation on the granular details”.  Wallet providers now obtain a “Trust or Company Service Provider” license, but under the new regime, they are likely to need a stablecoin wallet license.  Issuers of widely used stablecoins like tether (USDT) might have to set up a locally incorporated entity.  CoinDesk reached out to stablecoin issuers Tether and Paxos for comment. On the publication of this article, they had not responded to questions on whether they were interested in applying to be regulated under the proposed stablecoin regime.  A spokesperson for Circle did not respond directly to a query on whether the company would be interested in obtaining stablecoin licenses in Hong Kong, but said that it had “been in discussions with regulators globally on stablecoin regulatory developments.”  How firm is its stance?  There is a chance the HKMA will relax its stance because the city is trying to welcome talent and keep its position as an international financial center.  The HKMA is focused on ensuring the stability of Hong Kong’s financial system but it also has another role in promoting the economy.  Crypto companies were not the only ones to participate in consultations. No surprise, then, that traditional banks and virtual banks, which have been competing to sign retail customers and companies involved in cross-border trade payments all gave feedback to the regulator.  HKbitEX Chief Strategy Officer Ken Lo said there’s also the question of “how stablecoins can be used to facilitate the next era of payment,” pointing to the strength of wholesale and commercial banking in the city.  Michael Wong, partner at law firm Dechert, said that judging from previous discussions with the HKMA over the private equity fund regime, the regulator will take a commercially friendly stance to “make it work for both the industry and also from the investor protection perspective.”  Locally incorporated entity  “If they want to do something which is friendly to the industry, they shouldn't really have this requirement that the issuer has to be incorporated in Hong Kong,” Wong said. Registering as a non-Hong Kong company in Hong Kong is a simple registration, he said.  Requiring foreign entities that have already issued stablecoins to set up an entity in Hong Kong then issue stablecoins out of that entity would create complications.  Legally, investors holding stablecoins issued from the Hong Kong entity would only be able to go after that entity, not its other entities, Wong said.  Liquidity might also be an issue. If only a small market used the stablecoin issued from the issuer’s Hong Kong entity, it might also affect trading pairs, Jason Chan, senior associate at Dechert, said.  Principal business  HKMA’s current position would mean that exchanges would have to segregate their virtual asset business from their stablecoin business.  Under the segregation requirement, companies will face additional costs. “Every time you want to trade, let's say 0.1 bitcoin, you have gas fees going back and forth to the custodians,” Tim Byun, global government relations officer at OKX, said.  Byun said there are other ways to keep the focus on protecting consumers and ensure exchanges aren’t operating a fractional reserve system where they lend out customers’ funds.  He pointed to OKX’s use of Merkel trees and its commitment to go for an audit this year.  “To quickly just move the entire crypto industry into the traditional securities world is like pushing a square peg into a round hole,” Byun said.

Read more: Hong Kong Proposes Rules for Crypto Trading Platforms  According to Bloomberg, officials from China’s Liaison Office have been frequent guests at crypto gatherings in Hong Kong. The tone of their visits and followup calls with certain projects has been friendly.  Some stakeholders think that this can be seen as an endorsement of Hong Kong’s push to become a crypto hub, with the Special Administrative Region of China using its separate legal system and markets to be a testing ground – much in the same way as Hong Kong was China’s first test of open markets in the 20th century.  “As long as one doesn’t violate the bottom line, to not threaten financial stability in China, Hong Kong is free to explore its own pursuit under ‘One Country, Two Systems,’” Bloomberg quotes Nick Chan, a National People’s Congress member and a crypto lawyer, as saying.  On Monday, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) made its first push to open the door to retail crypto trading, beginning a consultation process for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) seeking a license to provide trading services for retail.  Some of the requirements the SFC proposes involve a due diligence process on tokens prior to listing, which would see only pre-approved tokens available to traders, as well as setting up a risk profile for clients to ensure their exposure is “reasonable.”  The SFC has just concluded a multi-year consultation process that will see exchanges being allowed to serve professional investors (defined as those with a net worth of over $1 million) on June 1.

42388036,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR2OXb,1676943715,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Edges Toward $25K During Slow Economic Day,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin is starting the day in Asia at $24,815. What's going to drive it higher?  Insights: A report by a Canadian judge considered the government's use of the Emergencies Act to quell a ""Freedom Convoy"" protest focused on Ottawa last year, but avoided recommending additional crypto regulation. The document may say more about officials' ongoing uncertainties in addressing issues related to digital assets.  Prices  China, Enthusiasm, and Euphoria Might Drive Bitcoin to the Next Support Level  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,133 −4.6 ▼ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $24,815 +460.1 ▲ 1.9% Ethereum (ETH) $1,701 +18.2 ▲ 1.1% S&P 500  4,079.09 −11.3 ▼ 0.3% Gold  $1,851 +10.1 ▲ 0.5% Nikkei 225  27,531.94 +18.8 ▲ 0.1% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Monday was a holiday in the U.S. in honor of Presidents’ Day, but crypto never sleeps.  Bitcoin is opening the day in Asia up 1.9% to $24,815, while ether is up 1% to $1,701.  China-themed layer 1 protocols experienced quite a surge this week. Conflux is up 500% during the last week, while NEO is up 70%. Both are up around 40% in the last day.  Last week Conflux announced it is partnering with China Telecom to build blockchain-based SIM cards. It’s important to remember, however, that the Conflux Network within China is a separate, tokenless, government-approved blockchain used in conjunction with the country’s Blockchain Service Network.  Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, says that solid economic data from a post-COVID-19, re-opened China is going to drive up stocks and crypto prices.  “The bullish case for the Chinese economy remains solid, and the likely release of stimulus over the next couple of months as it gathers pace could supercharge that,” he told CoinDesk in an email. “Domestic demand is going to be the cornerstone of the economic revival, and policymakers appear poised to unleash that to its full potential.”  While crypto and stocks might be on an upward trajectory, Erlam doesn’t see gold going in the same direction.  “Gold traders do not share the eternal optimism that equity and crypto traders possess, and recent weeks have highlighted that perfectly,” he said. “The yellow metal fell into a corrective pattern and has struggled to get out since.”  This week might be a slow one with the U.S. holiday on Monday and not much scheduled for economic events in the U.S. and Europe, but it could be the start of a breakout for bitcoin, with price gains based on enthusiasm alone.  “Cryptos are seemingly existing in a world of their own, with bitcoin rising 2% again on Monday and eyeing the highs of the last week once more,” he said. “This could be a really pivotal level for bitcoin and a break of it could generate plenty more enthusiasm. And we've all seen what happens when enthusiasm and euphoria exist in cryptos.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Solana SOL +5.5% Smart Contract Platform Avalanche AVAX +4.5% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM +4.0% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC −1.3% Smart Contract Platform Chainlink LINK −0.6% Computing Polkadot DOT −0.1% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Crypto Regulation Missing From Canada Inquiry Into Emergencies Act  The long-awaited report from the inquiry into the Canadian government’s use of the Emergencies Act to quell last year’s ""Freedom Convoy"" protest centered in Ottawa was released Friday afternoon.  For observers of Canadian politics, the inquiry, led by Justice Paul Rouleau was fascinating. But despite crypto acting as an important fundraising mechanism, and protesters using crypto to openly defy the country’s first-ever crypto-related sanctions, absent from Justice’s Rouleau were recommendations for strengthening controls on digital assets.  Revelations from the hearings  In the early weeks of the hearings, which occurred last November, the revelations came fast and furious: Canada’s national intelligence agency did not consider the protests a national security threat and warned that invoking the Emergencies Act would only radicalize protesters. Police were largely sympathetic to protesters and provided a “steady stream” of leaks to organizers. Despite early claims that Russia was backing the protest, intelligence officials revealed that it was largely Canadian-funded.  Most of Rouleau’s recommendations address the inter-jurisdictional squabbling that defined the first few weeks of the protest.  Buried in the last pages of the 56-recommendation report is Rouleau’s crypto-related recommendation – the 54th.  “The federal government should continue with its study into cryptocurrencies. This study should be informed by the findings of this Commission,” Rouleau wrote. “Federal officials should seek to collaborate with counterparts at other levels of government to benefit from existing study in this area and to ensure that any jurisdictional issues may be addressed.”  Bitcoin ‘defied government crackdown’  Central to the financing of the protest was bitcoin.  Traditional crowdfunding platforms such as GoFundMe and GiveSendGo had exposure to Canadian banking rails, and were frozen after an Ontario Superior Court judge issued a Mareva injunction ordering the platforms and their banking partners to cease facilitating the Convoy’s transactions.  But the Convoy’s bitcoin remained outside of the Court’s control.  As CoinDesk reported in February last year, most of the bitcoin wallets were completely drained, according to on-chain data. Nearly all of the 20 BTC (about $788,000 U.S. at last year’s exchange rates) was moved to other, non-sanctioned wallets, with some landing at major centralized exchanges.  Among bitcoin’s true believers, this was an exemplification of the digital asset’s perfect use case: censorship-resistant money.  “Bitcoin proved itself to be a sovereign financial rail as hundreds of thousands of dollars in BTC reached protesters in spite of government efforts to block donations,” Bitcoin magazine wrote in June. “Its use as a system for getting hundreds of thousands of dollars in value directly into the hands of those who had been blacklisted by the Canadian government may be the most potent illustration of that power to date.”  But this opinion isn’t universally shared within the crypto industry.  In February 2022, CoinDesk columnist J.P. Koning wrote that bitcoin was a bad way to fund the Ottawa protest, and that funding an illegal protest in any currency isn’t right despite the government’s worrying use of the Emergencies Act, which he wrote made him “very uncomfortable.”  “When protest becomes illegal, it's the task of the police to step in and break it up. Any inability to do so on their part hurts one of the other key pillars of a democratic society: rule of law. If the law no longer functions, Canada would quickly descend into a state of perpetual chaos,” Koning wrote.  Canadian choke point  In the U.S., there appears to be a whole-of-government approach to cracking down on the crypto industry.  As Nic Carter, general partner at Castle Island Ventures, wrote in a recent blog post, crypto-fiat off-ramps in the U.S. are tightening. In early January, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) issued a joint statement discouraging banks from dealing with the crypto industry.  Metropolitan Commercial Bank, which served exchanges like Crypto.com, ceased doing business with the industry shortly after. Binance quickly announced it will only process fiat transactions of over $100,000, due to a new policy at Signature Bank, before suspending USD bank transfers altogether for retail clients. Then, in late January, the Kansas City Fed denied Custodia’s application for a master account.  Carter writes that this reminds him of the Obama-era ""Operation Choke Point,"" a scheme, as he describes it, as marginalizing specific industries operating legally by putting pressure on the banking sector.  Canada isn’t immune from the same environment of tightening crypto regulations. CoinDesk reported in February that Canada’s umbrella markets regulator, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), is preparing for a new regulatory push. One source that spoke to CoinDesk said the new proposed rules will make doing business in Canada too expensive for exchanges.  But the updates to these rules aren’t coming as a result of the Trucker Convoy’s blatant defiance of the country’s first crypto sanction.  Despite Rouleau and the authorities knowing that bitcoin worked as intended for the protesters, allowing them to keep their coins so they can fight another day, increased crypto regulations won’t come as a result of this, but rather as a push to continually define crypto as a security.
