42429036,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrN5h,1525726220,"Futures Launch Weighed on Bitcoin's Price, Say Fed Researchers","Researchers from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank's San Francisco division believe that the launch of bitcoin futures on several marketplaces in the U.S. last December played a role in a subsequent slump in the cryptocurrency's price.  According to a research paper published on Monday, the authors – including three researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco as well as a finance professor from Stanford University – believe bitcoin's recent price trend is somewhat similar to how the housing bubble developed in the U.S. during the 2000s.  And the introduction of bitcoin-related derivatives played a part in that trend, the authors wrote.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Cboe and CME Group moved their bitcoin futures products to the market near the end of the year after obtaining approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It was around this time that the price of bitcoin nearly hit $20,000 after surging throughout that year, only to fall close to $6,000 by the end of the first week of February.  Citing data and calculations conducted through their research, the Fed paper's authors argue that the ""rapid rise of the price of bitcoin and its decline following [the] issuance of futures on the CME is consistent with pricing dynamics suggested elsewhere in financial theory.""  Such pricing dynamics, as the researchers explained, refer to a trend where demand for a financial instrument is initially driven by optimists who push up the price until the point where the market introduces a mechanism that allows pessimists to invest reversely.  The researchers argued:  ""And until December 17, those investors [optimists] were right: As with a self-fulfilling prophecy, optimists’ demand pushed the price of bitcoin up, energizing more people to join in and keep pushing up the price. The pessimists, however, had no mechanism available to put money behind their belief that the bitcoin price would collapse. So they were left to wait for their 'I told you so' moment.""  That said, such trends may not continue indefinitely, as the authors further suggested.  As the bitcoin mining process goes on and fewer coins become available (as a result of the scheduled halving of the network subsidy, now pegged at 12.5 BTC per block), the authors argue that the transactional function of bitcoin as a payment method could play a leading role in driving its value as ""speculative dynamics disappear.""

In a blog post published Monday entitled ""ICOs — Not Just 'Good-to-Have,' But Necessary,"" the Binance chief took aim at the VC world, notably writing that he believes ""raising money through ICOs is about 100 times easier than through traditional VCs, if not more.""  It's a notable statement, considering Binance's position as one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. Nor is it perhaps surprising, given its 2017 token salehttps://www.binance.com/resources/ico/Binance_WhitePaper_en.pdf as well as the exchange's recent spat with U.S. VC firm Sequoia. As reported previously by CoinDesk, Zhao was sued by Sequoia in Hong Kong for allegedly speaking to other investors while in talks about a possible capital injection to the firm.  In the blog post, Zhao argued that ""a vast majority of 'professional VCs' have no clue about the projects or field they invest in.""  ""Many of them have zero startup experience and don’t even have a basic understanding of the technologies involved their fields,"" Zhao went on to write. And despite admitting ICOs result in failure or outright fraud, Zhao still believes that ""compared to 'traditional VC invested projects,' a larger ratio of ICO projects will succeed.""  What's more, he argued that most of those putting their money in such tokens are aware that they may not succeed in the long run.  ""Most ICOs are new startup projects, and have a high rate of failure, just like in traditional startups. This is nothing new. Most ICO investors already know this. ICO investors are early adopters (and learners),"" later concluding:  ""The faster movers will reap exponential benefits. Don’t get left behind.""

42429051,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrNPh,1525714223,What to Expect When Congress Talks Blockchain Tuesday,"A pair of Congressional subcommittees will continue their fact-finding mission on blockchain during a hearing tomorrow.  Tomorrow's session will be more narrowly focused compared to a similar hearing held by the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology's Research and Technology and Oversight Subcommittees in February.  While that event cast a broad net – covering blockchain applications beyond the realm of cryptocurrencies – the one on Tuesday will hone in on the tech's use in supply chain management.  A representative for Lamar Smith, the chairman of the House Science Committee, told CoinDesk that the hearing will host ""experts in intellectual property, cybersecurity, as well as shipping and logistics.""  These include Douglas Maughan, who serves as the cybersecurity division director for the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate; NUBY Law PR counsel Robert Chiaviello; Michael White, who serves as head of global trade digitization for Maersk; and Christopher Rubio, the vice president of global customs brokerage staff for UPS.  It's this group, press secretary Brandon VerVelde says, that will help steer the committee's thinking on blockchain's use in this area.  ""The committee has an interest in supply chain risk management (SCRM) through our jurisdiction over the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, which has worked extensively on SCRM,"" VerVelde said, adding:  ""This hearing is intended for information-gathering for the committee members. We look forward to learning a lot from the witnesses.""  Indeed, those hoping for the kinds of fireworks seen in February when the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) hearing before the Senate Banking Committee – or during a House hearing on initial coin offerings in March – will likely be disappointed, given its info-gathering nature.  What lawmakers are saying  Rep. Roger Marshall, in a statement to CoinDesk, referred back to the Science Committee's past work and framed tomorrow's gathering as a continuation of that process.  ""This hearing will build upon the previous one, which explored the science behind blockchain technology. I know the intent of the hearing is to be informative but look forward to seeing where the discussion will go and the questions my colleagues ask,"" he said.  According to Illinois Representative Randy Hultgren, the conversation will focus in part on how the tech can solve issues around intellectual property theft – a potential hot-button issue considering the Trump administration's recent statements on IP theft by the Chinese government.  “This hearing will help examine how new technologies are improving the ways in which consumers can be better informed about where their products are coming from, how companies can validate a secure, ethical supply chain and how U.S. intellectual property can be better defended against unlawful practices,"" Hultgren said in a statement.  That push for transparency – particularly on the front of counterfeit goods – is highlighted in the hearing charter published ahead of the event.  ""The hearing will focus on how this technology can be leveraged to provide greater supply chain visibility and combat the distribution of counterfeit products,"" the document states.

42429052,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrNXh,1525698006,3D Printing Could Be Blockchain's True Game-Changer,"Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.  After multiple proofs of concept, pilots and early rollouts, supply chain management is emerging as the killer app for enterprise blockchain technology, the very first to be “going live” – to cite the theme of this year’s Consensus conference.  But while multiple blockchain projects worldwide are demonstrating how smart contracts, data sharing protocols and cryptographic traceability can unlock trade finance, improve risk management, streamline customs processing and boost transparency, the biggest change for global trade is yet to come.  That will be when the Internet of Things, 3D printing and other automating technologies finally free manufacturing from the constraints of geography. At that moment, blockchain technology could come into its own, enabling an entirely new paradigm of decentralized, on-demand production and forcing a realignment of global economic power.  Reaching this new paradigm requires advances in all these technologies. But just as importantly, it will require manufacturers to adopt a more open-minded approach toward optimizing the balance between competition and collaboration and toward the role that blockchains can play in finding that.  As of now, big manufacturing, shipping and trading companies tend to view supply chains from a proprietorial perspective. They talk about their supply chains as if they are a club that suppliers join only after pre-certification establishes a trusted relationship with the buyer.  Inevitably, these businesses are favoring permissioned blockchain systems, with the distributed ledger either managed by a single, centralized party such as a major retailer or producer or validated collectively by a consortium of those same pre-established suppliers. Permissioned blockchains reinforce the “clubbiness” of the shared enterprise.  But when additive manufacturing eventually makes it possible to rapidly respond to customized orders anywhere in the world by spinning up production in the customer’s neighborhood, manufacturers will need to quickly onboard 3D-printer providers – including many with which they have not established bonds of trust.  In that case, a permissioned blockchain could backfire, as the validators’ instinct could be to exercise their collective gatekeeping powers to protect their own market interests against those of the outsiders. Revenue opportunities would go wanting.  By contrast, enterprises that take a more open approach to business partnerships may find that a permissionless system gives them a competitive advantage over the permissioned supply chain clubs.  If 3D-printing machines can be uniquely identified with cryptographic primitives, and if their transactions, data emissions and overall performance can be logged to a registry that’s trustlessly notarized in a permissionless, open-access blockchain, then users of such a system could enjoy a very fluid onboarding process, making it much easier to respond to customer demand when it arises.  Brave new world  Clearly, this all depends upon significant technological improvements to make permissionless blockchains enormously more scalable – including the development of payment channels and interoperability protocols such as lightning and other “layer two” technologies.  It will also require standards for certifying in-built chips, so that the interconnected printing machines, sensors and other devices that will form these high-tech manufacturing networks can reliably provide the data upon which this system of decentralized trust will depend.  So for now, this scenario exists only in the imagination. But the thought experiment is useful, as it paints a dramatically different picture of the global economy, one that will raise a whole new set of challenges.  One of those was foreseen by an innovation team at precision parts manufacturer Moog Inc. when it conceived of its Veripart solution for 3D-printed parts. Specifically, Moog realized the need to ensure the integrity of the software files shared with different printing machines, to know that flaws haven’t been introduced into 3D-printed products, whether by hackers or human error.  It’s a problem that, as the Moog team recognized, also requires a blockchain-like system of distributed trust with which to track the development of the software code as it passes from one engineer to another.  If these changes occur, they would significantly alter the ownership structure of entire manufacturing industries. Labor-intensive factories and assembly lines would be a thing of the past, and there would be many fewer stages in the production chain from primary material extraction to finished product. Importantly, the intellectual property attached to the varying designs of highly customizable products would have an elevated importance.  One can foresee supply chains shifting away from today’s sequential, iterative processes of production – where goods shift downstream as payments go upstream – toward more of a teamwork-driven model. Manufacturing could be the result of a collaborative effort between various owners of different pieces of IP, each claiming a pre-agreed proportion of revenues from the end sale, paid out via a smart contract. Think of how contributors to a movie or music project are paid royalties and you get the idea.  (For more on blockchain technology’s role in this “demand chain” future, read a forthcoming essay by CoinDesk advisor Pindar Wong that will be published when Consensus begins on May 14.)  A new notion of labor  Whether this world comes to pass or not, a key element of this vision seems certain to do so: the further disintermediation of manual labor from manufacturing and the continued ascendancy of creative work. It’s a bleak outlook for those who expect to make a living from the former and portends even greater power for successful designers and owners of popular brands.  For a more equitable, harmonious and innovative society, we are going to need a dynamic model that subjects inventors to constant competition from a wide pool of newcomers with ever better designs. That means reducing barriers to entry, which in turn means curtailing gatekeeping intermediaries' power to block the innovative efforts of others.  Here, too, a decentralized architecture will matter.  As the global economy evolves, it will be important to encourage a disintermediated system of distributed trust in which people have control of their data and ideas and are able to trade them with each other on their own terms.  It’s an exciting future, but it could also go very wrong. A model based on the principles of open-source, open-access and permissionless innovation is the best way to get the balance right.  3D-printing spools image via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Michael J.

42429040,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrNBh,1525694429,New Korean Financial Watchdog Chief Takes Softer Tone on Cryptos,"The new head of a South Korean financial watchdog has taken a softer tone on cryptocurrencies and hinted that his agency may consider easing rules for exchanges, The Korea Times reports.  Yoon Suk-heun, the incoming governor of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), who is considered a reformist in the country, told reporters at his inauguration, ""Regarding cryptocurrencies, there are some positive aspects.""  Improving regulations, he said, would produce a more stable financial system with better services and products.  At the event, Yoon declined to go into detail about any regulatory changes that the FSS is mulling for domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, saying the process will take some time to be finalized.  ""There are a lot of issues that need to be addressed and reviewed. We can figure them out but gradually,"" he said.  Yoon will officially commence his role as governor of the regulator on May 8.  The news comes after the country cracked down on domestic cryptocurrency trading at the end of last year, mandating real-name verification of exchange users as of the end of January 2018.  Since then, the FSC has been conducting inspections at exchanges to ensure they are complying with the anti-money laundering rules.  In March, it was also reported that South Korea's ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) – brought in by the country's Financial Services Commission last September – could soon be eased.  According to another Korea Times report from last week, a group of lawmakers hopes to have a bill approved this year that would legalize ICOs ""under the government's supervision.""

42429053,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrNZh,1525690825,Bitcoin Looks for Price Support After Failed $10K Crossover,"Bitcoin's (BTC) pullback in prices over the weekend has dampened the immediate prospects for the bulls, the technical studies indicate.  Having witnessed a bullish pennant breakout last Friday, the cryptocurrency looked set to scale the $10,000 mark in a convincing manner over the weekend.  However, the bullish move unexpectedly ran out of steam at $9,990 at 13:00 UTC on Saturday, according to Bitfinex, and had retreated to $9,258 earlier today.  As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,400, representing a 2.67 percent drop from the previous day's close of $9,658.  While the pullback is not good for the bulls, only a drop below $8,650 would give the bears the upper hand.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows the pullback occurred after BTC was rejected (marked by a circle) at the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $9,950.  As noted above, BTC had looked on a solid ground following the bull pennant breakout, so the drop to $9,300 came as something of a surprise and has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook.  That said, a rebound from the ascending (bullish) 100-candle moving average (MA) in the 4-hour chart could put $10,000 back on the map.  Daily chart  The daily chart shows that the 10-day MA is sloping upwards (bullish), providing more cause for bull optimism, especially if today's candle closes (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (located at $9,468).  On the other hand, if BTC closes below the 10-day MA, then the case for a further drop towards $8,652 (April 26 low and pennant low as seen in 4-hour chart) would strengthen.  View  The pullback from $9,990 to $9,258 has dampened the immediate bullish outlook.  Repeated failure on the part of the bears to keep prices below the ascending 100-candle MA on 4-hour chart, and a close today above the 10-day MA of $9,468, could yield re-test of $10,000.  A close above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance seen today at $9,980, would open the doors to $13,475 (target as per the measured height method), although the target looks far-fetched for now. In the short-run though, BTC could rise to $11,700 on the back of an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.  Bearish scenario: A break below $8,652 (pennant low) would add credence to rejection at inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance and signal a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. In such a case, BTC will likely drop to levels below $8,000.

The seed funding round was led by PTB Ventures with additional involvement from Omidyar Network and Learn Capital. The funding comes months after MIT unveiled that it had partnered with Learning Machine on the digital diploma initiative, which is based on the open-source Blockcerts standard.  Last fall saw other academic institutions and organizations launch their own Blockcerts-based pilots, including the University of Melbourne and Malta's government. That software tool, according to Learning Machine vice president of business development Natalie Smolenski, can be used to link academic certifications to different blockchains – including bitcoin and ethereum – with the goal of eliminating degree forgery.  The startup hopes to allow clients to use any blockchain they want she said, noting that some customers might prefer a public chain versus a private one.  ""Right now in part I think because blockchain technology is still relatively new, there are a lot of high or strong emotions about which blockchain is better than another and blockchain has kind of engendered these fierce loyalties,"" she said, adding:  ""We don’t want to pick winners with blockchain. We do generally recommend users pick blockchains with a proven record but ultimately you don’t want to prescribe to customers which blockchain they should use. If they have strong feelings about ethereum, they should use ethereum; if they have strong feelings on bitcoin, they should use bitcoin; if they have strong feelings on a private blockchain they should use a private blockchain.""  Smolenski went on to predict that educational institutions will increase their use of the technology – adding that she hopes they will learn toward tapping open-source projects.  ""This is the future,"" she told CoinDesk. ""By 2020 most institutions will be using blockchains in some way, shape or form and the question we have to answer right now is are the solutions going to be open-standard or are they going to be proprietary?""

42380651,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yepL,1525676450,The Age of Endless Blockchain Forks Is Coming to an End,"Paul Brody is the global innovation blockchain Leader at EY.      When we sit down inside of EY and discuss what the biggest risks are to the future of the blockchain industry, one topic that comes up again and again is the high rate at which key blockchains are forking and the possibility that future forks will split apart large blockchains with critical mass.  This is important because we do not believe that private blockchains will scale effectively beyond highly specific use cases into a general-purpose platform for digital contracting between enterprises. That job, if any system is to take it, will belong to public blockchains.  The more companies and users there are on a single network, the more likely it is you can transact with your key business partners over a common infrastructure.  But, if public blockchains splinter into many different camps, one of their key advantages over networks of private blockchains will disappear.  Right now, however, forking a public blockchain is as easy as copy and paste, and it happens all the time as a means to “resolve” (I'm using that word in a very limited way) governance disputes.  This option won’t be viable for much longer, however, as real-world assets represented by digital tokens start popping up on public blockchains. Links between those assets – be they real estate, diamonds, gold or U.S. dollars in escrow accounts – and the blockchain tokens will only be valid on the primary network.  If they don’t already, the purchase agreements for these tokens and assets will need to be quite specific about what constitutes the “primary” or “original” blockchain on which the token is located, and external firms involved in attestation and audit will have to agree to and link up those plans.  The role of external firms will be particularly important going ahead. As blockchains are more and more linked to ownership of real-world assets, verifying the link to those assets is going to be important to investor confidence.  It will still be possible to fork blockchains, but the chances that users will come to alternative paths is declining by the day. Those users will be closely tied to their investment assets, which if they represent off-chain items, will have one and only one valid public blockchain representation.  As a result, it will become more and more important for the major public blockchains to develop robust governance models that are able to manage change and incorporate the views of stakeholders. It is also important for users to understand that as blockchains mature, they are likely to become much less dynamic and change less frequently.  It’s no accident that trustworthy institutions tend to evolve slowly and prize stability.

42380646,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yeo5,1525665627,The Next Generation of Crypto Exchanges Has One Big Missing Piece,"2018 could end up being a banner year for a much-hyped cryptocurrency creation.  Heralded as a way to put true custody back into the hands of traders, decentralized exchanges have moved out of R&D phase and are enrolling early adopters. But before users can start rejoicing, there's a serious chicken-and-egg problem, one that entrepreneurs believe is preventing the model from challenging the Coinbases and Krakens of the world.  In short, you need liquidity to get adoption, yet in order to get adoption, liquidity must be good, a fact acknowledged by even those who see the potential in more high-tech trading offerings.  But more broadly, it’s worth looking at how centralized exchanges solve this problem. Oftentimes, they make deals with market makers to incentivize them to create liquidity. These incentives usually come in the form of a rebate or reward that's exchanged for the guarantee a certain amount of what traders call “order book depth” is maintained at all times.  Some centralized exchanges will even employ temporary strategies to solve the problem, such as market making themselves with their own capital, and will basically replicate order books from other more liquid exchanges (plus a spread) to try to attract traders.  There are some practical issues: decentralized exchanges are limited to trade in cryptos only. That means people can't actually use regular US dollars to buy a token. They first have to go to a regulated exchange to put in US dollars (or other government-backed currencies) to buy bitcoin or ether.  Then, with bitcoin or ether, they can go to a decentralized exchange to buy the more tokens. As such, it’s perhaps no surprise that to those familiar with more user-friendly Wall Street solutions, this can all seem a bit much.  As Daniel Cawrey, CEO, Pactum Capital explains:  ""Most investors/traders are already intimidated by bitcoin. So, to have them jump through hoops to trade on a decentralized exchange to trade a token with a tiny market cap causes a lot of people to give up.""  Cawrey characterizes it as a question of cost and benefit. Essentially, most tokens don’t do much in the way of volume, which makes the set-up hurdles even more pronounced.  That said, there have been early successes.  For example, AirSwap, the decentralised marketplace for ethereum tokens that launched last week, handled over $1 million worth of transactions on its first day of trading.  A different take  Still, those working to bring the business model to life see it differently.  AirSwap, co-founded by former Virtu Financial trader Michael Oved, goes so far as to use a bulletin board-style system that emulates the way traditional foreign exchange traders interact directly with each other, peer to peer.  The platform replaces the traditional order book with a kind of search engine called an “indexer,” whereby traders can announce their intent to trade, making them discoverable by their peers using smart contracts. It currently trades some 25 tokens and that number is growing.  In this way, AirSwap co-founder Don Mosites believes this selection is enough to overcome the issues Cawrey discussed, by offering a selection of markets that may be small today, but have been growing in volumes of late.  Mosites said: ""There are people all over the world looking to make trades, often in large amounts, but may not have the tools.”  “The first-day volume was a testament to the global community we've built, our ‘peer discovery’ system and the smart contract used by peers to make trades. There is a ton of demand for a simple and secure OTC system like this,” he continued.  Other approaches  Yet, this isn't the only approach - smart developers are dropping IP all over the place with different ways to decentralize ethereum token trading, while attracting the necessary liquidity.  For example, KyberNetwork (launched in April), has also gotten rid of the order book, and maintains a reserve warehouse controlled by a Kyber smart contract.  In order to attract as much liquidity as possible from Singapore’s burgeoning token economy, Kyber operates an open model - anyone can be a market maker or taker by interacting with the smart contracts.  “We solve the liquidity problem by bringing the market makers to our platform – anyone with a substantial amount of idle assets or even the token issuers themselves,” said Loi Luu, the co-founder of KyberNetwork. “They can get more profits on their idle assets by market making on our platform.”  Also looking to leverage the explosion in ethereum tokens is the 0x protocol, which offers exchange operators (relayers) building on top of its smart contract system, the choice of being open or closed.  Using 0x in an entirely open and decentralised way, aspires to capture a networked liquidity effect. This means the smart contracts that essentially clear and execute trades are set so that the maker and taker of trades can be filled by any user.  But 0x can also be used to create a closed order book, or matching model, where the smart contract is set so the taker of any trade is always the relayer.  Trade-offs  As with most things in a decentralized context, there are trade-offs.  While openness may solve liquidity issues over time, it opens up an easy way of front-running trades. This can happen on ethereum when users observe market-moving orders and set a gas price for their own transaction higher than the transaction they're seeing.  Amir Bandeali, the CTO of 0x, pointed out this issue shouldn't be put completely on decentralized exchanges.  “This is not a problem that's specific to trading; front running is one of the larger issues of blockchains in general. If anyone submits a transaction to the blockchain, the entire transaction is public before it is mined,"" he said, adding:  ""But since decentralized exchanges are one of the first working use cases of blockchains, they have been getting a bad rap for this.”  To fortify the open approach, 0x is looking at introducing features like a trade execution coordinator, or an embeddable trade widget for open order books that can allow wallets and other applications to monetize by simply rebroadcasting orders from other relayers.  Kyber, which is also open, removes the incentive to front run by limiting the transaction value per trade. The trade size is currently capped at SGD 5000 ($3,800) per trade for non-KYC'd users and SGD 10000 SGD for KYC’d users.  Combining the 0x protocol with a closed order book model is Paradex, founded by trading platform veteran Ron Bernstein. In this design settlement of trades takes place on the ethereum blockchain, but a closed matching model seeks to retain features that professional traders require such as best-price guarantees and price/time priority.  “The matching model does come with trade-offs,” said Bandeali. “It makes your relayer much less accessible to smart contracts. One of the main benefits of the open order book model is that you can execute trades atomically with other transactions, including other trades. You can't really benefit from this using the matching model.”  Bernstein acknowledged that matching prevents Paradex from participating in 0x’s aspiration for beneficial shared liquidity, but he insisted the trade-offs are incomparable.  “There’s a very small chance that aggregated or shared liquidity will be a mass adoption solution. It may be a temporary benefit while bootstrapping very new trading ecosystems like decentralized token trading,” said Bernstein, adding:  ""Liquidity is solved by partnerships with professional liquidity providers, like those already operating on centralized exchanges – and we’re courting a bunch of them.”  Missing piece image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,ETH | KNC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/07/the-next-generation-of-crypto-exchanges-has-one-big-missing-piece,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dedbb68bd7998459a27d8a773dcf5c47f4c6badd-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to RUV,  Icelandic police have sent Chinese authorities an inquiry after the latter country confiscated 600 mining computers. Police in the Tianjin area reportedly seized the machines after detecting unusually high electricity consumption, per Xinhua News.  The Chinese news agency explained that this may have been the ""largest power theft case in recent years,"" noting that eight high-power fans were also confiscated. The individuals running the mining farm short-circuited their electricity meter, thereby avoiding receiving a bill for the energy used to power the miners.  Left untouched, the meter would have recorded ""hundreds of thousands of yuan"" in bills, Xinhua reported.  However, it is unclear whether the machines seized in China have any relation to Iceland's ""Big Bitcoin Heist."" As previously reported, the machines were stolen across several incidents during December and January, and officials have so far had no luck in locating them. A $60,000 reward is offered by the machines' owner for any information which could lead to the computers.  The alleged mastermind behind the thefts is set to be extradited to Iceland from the Netherlands, where he was arrested after escaping a low-security prison and fleeing to Sweden.
