42420973,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAont,1648511404,Book Excerpt: 3 Stories of Bitcoin Changing Lives Outside the 'Dollar Bubble',"In the eyes of most Western elites, investors, journalists and academics, Bitcoin rates anywhere from an annoyance to a disaster.  In May 2021, American billionaire Charlie Munger described Bitcoin as “disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization.” Warren Buffett, once the world’s richest person, sat next to Munger in obvious agreement. He has said Bitcoin is “a delusion” and “rat poison squared,” and he has warned that he is sorry about its rise “because people get their hopes up that something like that is gonna change their lives.” Bill Gates, who also used to be the world’s richest person, has said Bitcoin is a “greater fool theory” investment and that he would short it, if he could.  HBO host Bill Maher skewered Bitcoin in an extended segment on his show, saying that the new currency’s promoters are “money-hungry opportunists.” A few weeks earlier, theNew York Times ran a story that said Bitcoin will “ruin the planet.” Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf has long pegged it as “ideal for criminals, terrorists, and money launderers.”  Alex Gladstein is chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation and has been vice president of strategy for the Oslo Freedom Forum since its inception in 2009.  Prominent Ivy League economist Jeffrey Sachs has said that Bitcoin offers “nothing of social value,” while former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has called it a tool for “totally reprehensible money laundering activity.”  Over the past decade, these financial experts, reporters, and policymakers have continuously pounded the narrative and told the world that Bitcoin is risky, dangerous, bad for humans and bad for the planet.  This is an excerpt from ""Check Your Financial Privilege,"" a publication of BTC Media and Alex Gladstein (2022). The book is available for order here.  They are wrong, and they are blinded mainly by their financial privilege.  How financial privilege blinds dollar users to Bitcoin’s importance  The critics cited above are all wealthy citizens of advanced economies, where they benefit from liberal democracy, property rights, free speech, a functioning legal system and relatively stable reserve currencies like the dollar or pound.  But only 13% of our planet’s population is born into the dollar, euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar or Swiss franc. The other 87% are born into autocracy or considerably less trustworthy currencies. As of December 2021, 4.3 billion people live under authoritarianism and 1.6 billion people live under double- or triple-digit inflation.  Critics in the dollar bubble miss the bigger global picture: Anyone with access to the internet can now participate in Bitcoin, a new money system with equal rules for all participants, running on a network that does not censor or discriminate, used by individuals who do not need to show a passport or an ID and held by citizens in a way that is hard to confiscate and impossible to debase.  While Western headlines focus on Coinbase going public, Tesla buying billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin and tech bros getting fabulously rich, there is a quiet revolution happening worldwide. Until now, governments and corporations have controlled the rules of money. That is changing.  To learn more, I spoke to Bitcoin users in Nigeria, Sudan and Ethiopia, three countries with a combined population of 366 million, well in excess of the number of individuals living in the United States.  Read More: 'Bitcoin Is the Revolution': An Interview With Alex Gladstein  The three speak for millions whose lived experience is much closer to that of the average person on this planet. Gates, Munger and Buffett may not have recently dealt with conflict and violence, black markets, relentless inflation, political repression and rampant corruption in their daily routine, but most do.  And yet, these bitcoiners are more hopeful for the future than the doomers listed in the chapter’s opening. For them, Bitcoin is a protest, a lifeline and a way out.  Here are their stories.  Bitcoin in Nigeria  Ire Aderinokun is a Nigerian entrepreneur. She is a front-end developer and user-interface designer from Lagos and is the cofounder, chief operating officer, and vice president of engineering at Buycoins, a cryptocurrency exchange that went through Y Combinator in 2018 and is now one of the most popular places to buy bitcoin in West Africa. She is a prolific writer, speaker, organizer and activist and one of the founding members of the Feminist Coalition, a group that champions equality for women in Nigerian society.  Aderinokun talks about Nigeria as a melting pot, like the “United States” of Africa. Three big ethnic groups dominate the country, but the population is split into hundreds of different tribes. This is a strength but also a challenge, as it is hard to bring so many different people together. The country is governed through a predominantly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south, and national leadership rotates between these constituencies. Nigeria boasts the largest economy in Africa, and the largest population with more than 200 million citizens, but much of the wealth is tied to the export of oil.  Like in many rentier states, there is massive corruption and inequality: While the fabulously rich jet set around the world, six Nigerians are impoverished every minute. People who have wealth and power, Aderinokun said, do not let it trickle down and do not invest it back in society. This has resulted in a situation where, in major urban areas such as Abuja and Lagos, there are countless lawyers, for instance, working in restaurants, toiling away in careers that are professionally beneath them, because there are not enough opportunities. Millions head to the big cities for jobs, only to come up empty handed.  As a result, Aderinokun said the country struggles with unemployment, especially among the youth; 62% of the population is under 25 years old. Out of this crisis, however, are upsides. She credits Nigerians with being incredibly entrepreneurial. People do what they need to do to get by and having a side hustle, she said, is natural.  Part of this need to hustle relates to the country’s economic situation, where the official inflation rate now stands around 15%, with food inflation even higher. In her personal experience, Aderinokun has seen the naira decline from 100 per dollar to 500 per dollar. People, she said, are quite aware that the elites are stealing from the citizens through currency debasement. It is expected. So much so that when one’s family or friend gets a government job, she said, there is an assumption that they will provide for you and a circle of others. The money trickles down through nepotism and the people at the top get fat. This is an example of the ""Cantillon effect"" in action, where those closest to the point of money creation benefit at the expense of the rest.

Alex Gladstein  Growing up, she saw people try to keep their money in dollars, send money abroad or buy real estate. This was how Nigerians could protect the fruits of their time and energy, but only a handful had these options. Now, Bitcoin is changing the game, allowing more people to save like never before. Any Nigerian with internet access now has an escape from their unreliable, unequal, exploitative national monetary system.  Aderinokun got her start in Bitcoin with a Coinbase account in 2016. She and her friends initially thought: Could we use this new technology to send money abroad? As it turned out, Bitcoin was easier and faster for sending money from Nigeria to the United States than traditional means. So, she decided to launch Buycoins, a cryptocurrency exchange. Paystack – the Nigerian tech giant – was just a few years old then, and she is grateful that it existed at the time, as it allowed Buycoins to reach customers and create an experience that otherwise would have been impossible.  At first, the payment component of Bitcoin was what really attracted Aderinokun, the idea that it could actually be easy instead of difficult to send money from one place to another, skipping over national borders. This, she thought, is something Bitcoin can fix.  Beyond the exchange itself, Buycoins also released an app called Sendcash to help Nigerians abroad send money home. Perhaps a family member moved to the United States and wanted to send dollars back. The recipient in Lagos would normally need a domiciliary account in dollars, but Aderinokun said those are difficult to open. Even then, the bank wire or using a service like Western Union can be costly and slow, and exchanging from dollars to naira can be difficult. She thought: Could Bitcoin help streamline the process?  With SendCash, users in the United States send bitcoin to the app, and it deposits as naira a few minutes later in any Nigerian bank account: a game changer. Today, the app can also send naira to the United States or Ghana, all using bitcoin as a payment rail.  Aderinokun said that around 45% of the Nigerian population has internet access. So is her mission worth it, if a majority of Nigerians still cannot even access Bitcoin? She said this is a dilemma she often ponders. There are countless internally displaced persons (IDPs) across Nigeria who cannot accept cryptocurrency because they do not have a smartphone. In the end, she said, the work and mission are worth it, because even though there are many who do not have internet access, there are tens of millions who do, and those individuals are sharing access to smart apps with those who do not have them.  As for the Gates and Buffets of the world: Aderinokun said some of Bitcoin’s critics may have valid points to debate, around, for example, the environmental impact – but she takes issue with Western elites saying there is no upside, or that it is a Ponzi scheme, or that it is just for fun.  They do not understand, she said, how important Bitcoin is for those who cannot get dollars. For billions, they are trapped in a flawed currency that does not fulfill the purpose of what currency is supposed to do. For many in Nigeria and beyond, Bitcoin is providing another option and solving real problems.  Is it just helping the rich? Aderinokun laughed and said: This is not the case at all. It is providing employment; it is helping people convert their naira to other currencies; it is enabling commerce where it was not previously possible. With the Feminist Coalition, it helped people overcome financial repression and the freezing of activist bank accounts. This is not, she said, just a case of people sitting around watching the price.  Moving forward, Aderinokun thinks more education is essential. Nigerians are still very misinformed about Bitcoin. The main reason they know about it, she said, is because the price keeps going up, and many do not see past that. Scams are a huge obstacle. Although, she said, more people are beginning to understand. They know bitcoin is volatile, but they see that it goes up and to the right over time, instead of down and to the right like the naira.  She also wants to focus on building bridges and ramps between the naira and cryptocurrencies. Buycoins works with a naira stablecoin, the NGNT, which she said can also be helpful to people without traditional bank accounts.  And building on- and off-ramps matters because the Nigerian government has Buycoins and other exchanges in its crosshairs. In February 2021, the regime pronounced that bitcoin was not legal tender and said banks should not hold or treat it as such. They later clarified that individuals could still trade but have pressured regulated financial institutions to stay away. Buycoins has been struggling to hold naira because banks do not want to work with it. But now, Aderinokun said, it has shifted to a peer-to-peer solution. When users need to go in and out of naira, buyers and sellers are matched in a marketplace.  Aderinokun does not actually think it is possible to effectively ban Bitcoin. The most the government can do, perhaps, is what it has already done – forcing institutions to stay away. But it cannot stop individuals from using hardware wallets or conducting peer-to-peer activity in a place like Nigeria. “No one,” she said, “can stop me.” It is like saying it could ban Facebook, she said. It could shut down the internet but that would have disastrous consequences for the whole nation.  What the government should be doing instead, she said, is trying to understand Bitcoin and working with exchanges to allow Nigerians to connect to the world around them. Aderinokun does not think the government should have an adversarial attitude. In fact, she believes Bitcoin can help it. Maybe it would even be a good thing if the Nigerian government figured out Bitcoin before other nations. But, she said, for the moment it is not even close to understanding how Bitcoin works. When asked if the government is using blockchain surveillance or spying on individual transactions, she laughed. It does not have the abilities or know-how yet, she said.  Read More: Nigeria’s CBDC: The Good, Bad and Ugly  As for the future, Aderinokun is hopeful because she has seen Bitcoin’s potential. She watched it shine in the context of human rights and activism. In October 2020, in the middle of nationwide protests against SARS – a notorious special police unit that was terrorizing citizens across the country – the Feminist Coalition began accepting donations via Flutterwave, a fintech product. This started off well enough but then the regime started cracking down. Its bank accounts were shuttered.  Bitcoin was the only option left. There was no other way to receive, store and spend money. For Aderinokun and her co-founders, this was an eye-opening moment. They ended up setting up a BTCPay Server to process gifts from around the world in a way that avoided address reuse and protected donor privacy. Celebrities including Jack Dorsey shared the link, and they raised more than 7 BTC.  It was a great learning experience, she said, as many young people learned about Bitcoin in this moment as a tool for activism. The experience renewed and strengthened her belief in products she is building at Buycoins. People saw that Bitcoin was cool and that the government could not stop it. Because of this, Aderinokun thinks that one day Bitcoin will be talked about in the same way, with the same importance, as radio, TV and the internet.  Asked if she is worried about a world where the government can no longer control the money, she said no, she is hopeful. Just printing more money, she said, has its downsides, taking that option away is not necessarily a bad thing.  Bitcoin in Sudan  Mo, also known by his Twitter handle as Sudan HODL, is a Sudanese doctor. He currently lives abroad in Europe, practicing medicine to support his family back home.  Mo sees his country with brutally clear eyes. He described the capital of Khartoum as a crowded, diverse megacity filled with pockets of extravagant wealth and surrounded by an enormous belt of poverty. It is a city of contradictions, he said, where palatial residences sit next to utter destitution.  Mo has worked in Darfur, where he described the lack of development as simply stunning. There is no educational or health infrastructure. During his time there, he was one of three or four doctors treating hundreds of thousands of people. There was a total lack of primary care and there were no pediatric hospitals. He was treating women who suffered from fistula. The national ruling class, he said, did not invest in these places. Warlords ultimately filled the power vacuum, with the youth choosing violence instead of school as a way to get ahead.  Mo told a tortured history of his country. Sudan, he said, has been living through a vicious cycle of military coups and authoritarian rule ever since gaining its independence from the British Empire and losing its fragile first democracy.  Islam, Mo said, did not come to Sudan by violence but through traders and Sufis. He said his Muslim ancestors historically had a peaceful interpretation of their religion. But in the 1980s, the rise of Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth (see Chapter III) led to the export of the extremist and militant ideology of Wahhabism to many places around the world, including Sudan. Wahhabism was foreign to Sudan’s culture but was forced into the country’s political structure.  By 1983, military governments had allied themselves with the Muslim Brotherhood and imposed Sharia law, alienating the predominantly Christian and animist south. A democratic revolution in 1985 was short-lived, as Islamists led by Omar al-Bashir staged another coup in 1989, paving the way for three decades of his rule. Society was militarized and the intelligentsia were purged. If one spoke out against the regime, Mo said, they were not just speaking out against government officials: They were speaking against Islam. They were against God himself. This gave Bashir an excuse for his brutality and new jihads against ethnic minorities.  Read More: Sudan's Central Bank Warns Against Using Crypto as Economy Suffers: Report  Since colonial times, minorities in South Sudan and Darfur had resisted authority from strongmen in faraway Khartoum. The seeds of this tension were planted in the 1950s when these populations fell under postcolonial Arab rule. Over time, these minority groups rebelled, only to be violently subjugated. The bloodshed peaked in Darfur in the early 2000s, when Bashir committed genocide, using the Janjaweed militias to murder hundreds of thousands and displace millions of people. This triggered the United States and European Union to increase sanctions against Sudan, cutting it off more deeply from the outside world.  Mo thinks it is important to share Sudan’s economic history, often overshadowed by the political story. In addition to the extreme inequality on display in Khartoum, there is a bigger picture of low-income workers trying to catch up to high inflation, while those closer to the regime manage to do well. Infrastructure decayed, and the average person suffered while Bashir and his cronies loaded up on weapons, real estate and foreign assets. Modern Sudan is another vivid and tragic example of the Cantillon effect.  It was not always like this. Mo said that under the gold standard, three Sudanese pounds once bought a dollar. There was a middle class, and Khartoum was known as the London of North Africa. But in 1960, the Sudanese central bank took over and devalued the currency, the first instance of what would happen many times over the coming decades.  When Bashir seized power in 1989, he installed a regime of economic terrorism. To instill fear in the population, he chose to make an example of a young man named Majdi Mahjoub, who was a single child living at home, looking after his elderly parents. A Christian minority in a community of traders, Majdi had possession of a few thousand U.S. dollars in his home, the result of many years of family commerce.  Bashir created a new special “economic” division, a sort of secret police, that would go home to home, searching for foreign currency or gold. When the jackbooted thugs came to Majdi’s house, they found his savings and arrested him. After a show trial, he was hanged, sending a message to the population: If anyone tries to use anything but the Sudanese currency through our banking system – if anyone tries to own their own money – they will get the death sentence. Even today, according to Mo, many Sudanese are fearful of using dollars or storing money at home.  At the same time, Bashir launched a tribute system to finance his activities. On top of what was taken through traditional taxation and seigniorage, citizens had to pay a portion of their income to help the martyrs of their dictator’s wars. The secret monetary police would spy on individuals, freeze bank accounts, confiscate assets and impose made-up fees on merchants. No reasonable suspicion was required. Mo calls it a system of national extortion.  As far as the currency itself, Mo recalled several times in his life when the system was overhauled. In the late 1980s, his family was living abroad in Saudi Arabia, and when they visited home, a quarter of a Sudanese pound could buy a sandwich or a tasty snack on the street. But after 1992, when Bashir changed the haram and colonial pound for the Islamic dinar, those quarter pounds became worthless. The mid-1990s saw massive inflation, with the “official rate” of the dinar going from around 400 per dollar to more than 2,000. Many years later, in 2007, Bashir decided to ditch the Islamic facade and switch back to the pound. Citizens had a small window to redeem dinars for the new currency, after which they were no longer legal tender, forcing citizens to surrender their savings or watch it disappear.  Today, after a series of devaluations and constant inflation, a Sudanese pound will officially obtain around $0.0025. According to Mo, inflation as of late 2021 is 340%. While the average citizen watched as their wages stagnated and living costs rose, Bashir and his cronies accumulated billions and saved them in foreign currencies, locked away in Swiss bank accounts. Today, the new Sudanese government is struggling to regain all that was looted and lost in the past 30 years.  In the spring of 2019, in a stunning example of people power, the Sudanese population finally pushed out Bashir. A fragile reform government followed, where military leaders of the old regime share power with a technocratic civilian government. People were initially optimistic about the change, Mo said, but the reality did not meet their expectations. At the end of 2021, the military came back into power.  He says the IMF has a deal to help give $5 per month to Sudanese families, and in a country where some only make a dollar a day, this seemed significant. The problem is the families are paid not in dollars but in pounds, so the value disappears after a few months. The sanctions levied on the Bashir regime are now gone, but most fintech products and payment apps are still not available for Sudanese, as corporations shy away due to “risk management.”  It is clear that, in some places, a political revolution is not enough. Toppling a tyrant like Bashir is a historical and incredible achievement; but the political situation remains difficult and people are still suffering. So, some, like Mo, are turning to Bitcoin.  In 2015, Mo first heard about this mysterious internet money, as he put it, on YouTube. He spent countless hours watching Andreas Antonopoulos videos and read through ""The Internet of Money,"" which helped him understand the “why” behind the new currency. He started to use it while working abroad, exchanging euros for bitcoin over PayPal on LocalBitcoins.com. He kept things small and mainly to himself. But in 2017, he started talking to family and friends. He told them: This is going to be a part of our future. Many of them are now saving in bitcoin.  As of today, Mo estimates that 13 million of Sudan’s 43 million people have internet access, and he thinks that, in a few years, that number will top 20 million. There are more and more people coming online, and there are now smartphones even in remote regions like Darfur and the Nuba Mountains. People are plugging in everywhere.  He said that the Sudanese who do already have smartphones have an extended responsibility to help others with their privilege. In his case, he has a large extended family that he supports. He is their “Uncle Jim”: lingo in the Bitcoin world for a knowledgeable friend who helps with Bitcoin matters.  Where there were once financial walls cutting off Sudan from the world, Bitcoin has made bridges. It is now easy for Mo in Europe to send money back to his friends and family. What once took days now takes minutes. And he does not have to trust any third parties or require his family to deal with thieves in government.  Mo is beginning to see just how massive the Lightning Network will be for Sudan because most future users will be in the micropayment space, sending transactions of $5 or $10, and will not be able to afford the increasingly high on-chain fees. Lightning is a second-layer payment network that sits on top of the main Bitcoin system and enables users to send bitcoin instantly for tiny fees anywhere in the world. If international exchanges can choose to service Sudan and enable Lightning withdrawals and deposits, he said that would be an enormous step forward for financial empowerment.  As for the likes of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, Mo said they might understand the technology behind Bitcoin, but they will never be happy about it because it is coming to seize a place on the global stage that they used to have just for themselves. In direct contradiction to billionaire claims that Bitcoin is worthless and has no social value, Mo knows many Sudanese who rely on it as a lifeline. Maybe, Mo said, the critics just cannot see past their financial privilege.  For Mo personally, Bitcoin has been transformative. He has started a podcast in Arabic for Sudanese youth to talk about Bitcoin, money, freedom and the future of their country. Fifteen years ago, he could not have imagined being this optimistic.  One of the darkest moments in his life was in 2013 after a peaceful political uprising was completely crushed. Mo left all social media. He could not bear to look at the bloody images and videos streaming from the violence. But now, with twin political and economic transformations, he sees the light at the end of the tunnel. When people say Bitcoin is hope, he says that he agrees.  Bitcoin in Ethiopia  Kal Kassa is an Ethiopian businessman. In a country of close to 120 million people, more than 70% of the population has no access to a bank account. This is a place, he said, where there are still communities that use salt for money.  In the remote northeast Afar region, dotted with volcanoes, rifts and deserts, the indigenous people mine salt, as they have for generations, and trek for days to barter it in markets for the goods they need. It is their store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. The word ""amole,"" Amharic for salt, is even used today in Ethiopia as the name of a mobile banking app.  According to Kassa, 70% of Ethiopians still live in rural areas. Outside of the capital of Addis Ababa, home to 5 million, very few have bank accounts or smartphones. In total, no more than 25 million Ethiopians are connected. To make matters worse, Ethiopia does not have open capital markets. Individuals cannot freely exchange their national currency – the birr – with dollars and vice versa. Sadly, Kassa said, the country is still under the influence of militant Marxism and economic centralization.  As of mid-2021, the National Bank of Ethiopia enforced a bank rate of 40 birr per dollar, with a black-market rate of 55 birr per dollar. Inflation is officially reported at around 20%. Kassa is not sure what the exact rate is but said that Ethiopians traditionally buy a chicken or sheep or lamb for Easter, and these prices go up steadily every year. When he arrived in Ethiopia in 2013 to start a consulting job, one lamb went for around 1,500 birr. As of late 2021, it can go anywhere from 5,000 to 7,000 birr.  Read More: Cardano in Africa: Inside IOHK's Ethiopia Blockchain Deal  Government wages do grow, Kassa said, but not on par with inflation. He estimated salaries in urban areas have perhaps doubled over the past decade, but goods have gone up by three-to-five times. Since inflation is so high and such a constant phenomenon, the upper classes use the dollar as their unit of account. But outside of the cities, people still account with, and their living standards fall with, the birr. In rural areas, people use cattle or sheep to store value. If they can, they obtain gold, which is rare and still considered very precious. Dollars are officially illegal.  The government is afraid that people will dump the birr for dollars, pushing the price of the birr toward zero. But the government operates a double standard, wanting to retain as many dollars as it can for its own purposes. If, for example, an Ethiopian runs a tourist service, they are allowed to take foreign payments into a dollar account, which they can keep in dollars and use to pay for imported goods for up to around two months. But if they do not use those dollars within that window, the government simply swaps the dollars out for birr at the official rate. Which, of course, means they get the fake price of 40 birr for one dollar and not the real market rate of 55.  Kassa’s brother was once arrested and imprisoned once simply because he had a $20 bill in his pocket. In Ethiopia, people are jailed for the crime of using better currency.  Starting in 2018, Ethiopia underwent a series of reforms under a young new leader who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for efforts to end hostilities with neighboring Eritrea. The shifts appeared to open up political space and move the country toward liberalism after more than 25 years of a police state. Three years later, however, repression, ethnic tensions and armed conflict have caused a democratic backslide. Uncertainty and war have caused major capital flight. On top of that, Ethiopia imports more than it exports: Oil, medical goods and cars, for example, are all brought in from other countries.  In this weak environment, Ethiopians are forced to buy government bonds, which, as Kassa dryly noted, have negative real interest rates. They are, as he put it, donations for the state.  Kassa was born in Ethiopia, but left as a young child, growing up in California. He moved back at the end of 2013, as a senior associate for Grant Thornton, working on privatization on the buy and sell sides. He lived there until the summer of 2020 when the government shut off the internet.  Kassa’s phone could still send SMS messages and make calls, but there was no data. The regime justified this as a defense against rebellions, but especially during the pandemic lockdown, this got old very quickly. So, that June, wearing just a backpack, he got on a plane and headed back to the United States.  Kassa first heard about Bitcoin in 2013, when his roommate was mining it at Chapman University, but the idea did not click for him. He spent years thinking bitcoin was just some kind of alternative and speculative investment. He said his penny drop moment actually came when he was at the airport in Addis Ababa in June 2020. As he was boarding the plane, he stood and wondered: If I had my wealth stored in gold or cattle, how could I take it across a border?  Today, Kassa has created Telegram groups where he pays freelancers, graphic designers and translators based in Ethiopia with bitcoin. In America, he said, most people treat bitcoin as an investment or as a savings account. But he is using it as a medium of exchange and payment, too. It is easier and cheaper, and now a part of his life.  Kassa is focused on the Lightning Network and uses it to pay his contacts in Ethiopia. He helps them set up the open-source, free Blue Wallet and pays them directly with Lightning. He is amazed at how easy it is and how it transmits hard value instantly halfway across the world.  On the other end, his contacts use Blue Wallet as their savings accounts, and they exchange locally into birr when they need to in peer-to-peer markets. This is, he said, hugely preferable to Western Union and birr-denominated accounts, where, for example, on a recent payment, Kassa had to pay $13 to send $100. When Kassa pays his colleagues, he pays them the full amount, rather than paying through the government exchange rate where authorities steal a portion. His contacts are their own banks, and no one can debase or remotely confiscate their funds. This, Kassa said, is a revolution.  Kassa does have concerns and fears about Bitcoin. For example, the Ethiopian government is hyper-concerned about satellite internet. If citizens are caught with satellite equipment, for example, they can go to prison. In this context, he is worried about the safety of people running their own Bitcoin servers. He also thinks that many people may end up using custodial services, since as of right now, many cannot even tell the difference between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and they are far away from understanding the difference between custodial (where you trust a third party to hold your bitcoin) and noncustodial (where you hold the keys to your bitcoin) services. He is cautious about all the new cheap smartphones flooding in from ZTE and Huawei, all from China. He is worried about people installing bitcoin wallets on these phones, as he does not think they are safe. In addition, because the phone networks are not reliable, people still carry cash in cities, even if they have smartphones, as sometimes the service goes out.  Kassa said the biggest obstacle to Bitcoin adoption in Ethiopia might be the false promise of alternative cryptocurrencies. In particular, he has identified Cardano as a threat. In a recent video, the currency’s creator spoke about working with the Ethiopian regime to incorporate five million students onto the Cardano blockchain and boasts that then they could be tracked with metadata throughout their life and career.  “Our vision and goals,” he said, “are directly in line with the goals of the Ethiopian government.” In contrast, Kassa is glad that Bitcoin’s goals are not in line with the aims of the thieves and bureaucrats who run his country. He worried that many may fall prey to schemes like Cardano.  As for Gates and Buffett: Kassa actually did get a chance to go to the Berkshire Hathaway event in Lincoln, Nebraska, a few years ago. It was very powerful, he said, to see 40,000 people coming together as part of a community. But the event was very inward looking, which explains how Buffett and his friends cannot see just how corrupt the world is around them. They do not see the water that they swim in and are seemingly blind to the trillions of dollars of money laundered each year through the banking system. For them to ignore the harms that the dollar system has caused on the developing world, Kassa said, and instead focus on the flaws of Bitcoin, is naive and self-serving. He is glad that these investors are dinosaurs. They are not the future.  In contrast, 75% of the population of Ethiopia is under the age of 27. Once they start using Bitcoin, Kassa thinks they will spread the technology quickly to friends and family. Adoption will not take decades but years. When he moved back to Ethiopia in 2013, there were about five million people online. Now, there are about 25 million. In the next five years, he expects a majority of the population will be connected and for Bitcoin to follow.  As far as priorities, Kassa thinks spreading education is most important. In 2021, he helped translate ""The Little Bitcoin Book"" (an intro to the subject) into Amharic. As far as he knows, there is no other Bitcoin content translated as of yet into Ethiopia's three major languages.  When asked if he is worried about the government cracking down on Bitcoin, he said that it will be hard to get in the middle of a hard-working Ethiopian and a better life. The population is young, agile, creative and adaptable. It will not be stopped. People, he said, are sick of poverty and earning money only to see it depreciate.  Today, Ethiopians are at war with each other. “We are fighting ourselves,” Kassa said. “If we are willing to kill each other to solve our problems, we will definitely be willing to try Bitcoin as an alternative.” And that, he thinks, will be a peaceful revolution.  ***  After reading the stories of Ire Aderinokun, Mo and Kal Kassa, and witnessing how Bitcoin is so valuable to people outside of the dollar bubble, then compare this with what Munger, Buffett, Lagarde, Sachs and others say about Bitcoin: They claim it is something with no social value, that it will just get people’s hopes up, only to let them down.  “Disgusting.”  “Rat poison.”  “I would short it.”  “Totally reprehensible.”  For most people, it is the government that lets people down. It is the government that is reprehensible. Liberation technologies should be invested in, not shorted.  And for those comfortable in the dollar bubble?  It’s time to check your financial privilege.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rose again.  Insights: Many economic powers in the Asia Pacific region remain confident about Treasury bills and gold as investments.  Technician's take: BTC's momentum turned positive for the first time since July, although a significant price rally could be delayed.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just under $47,650, a nearly 2% gain over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto, was changing hands under $3,400, a roughly 3% increase for the same period. Almost other major cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 for market cap spent much of Monday well into the green.  Bitcoin cracked the 2022 yearly breakeven point of $47,201 early afternoon Asia time, and has risen more than 15% over the past week. Ether is up more than 16% for the same timeframe.  ""What we're looking at basically is a general improvement in market sentiment,"" Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, adding that the digital currency prime broker's trading desks started seeing ""a more bullish tone"" last week.  ""Some derivative market metrics started flashing some signals,"" she said. Genesis, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.  The weekend price spike among bitcoin and other cryptos had puzzled some observers. Stocks in U.S. markets, whose gains have correlated with those of crypto prices in recent months, have been roughly flat over the last two trading days. The tech-focused Nasdaq rose 1.3% on Monday. The S&P 500 and DJIA increased by less than a percentage point.  Acheson noted that rising interest among institutional investors over the past two weeks, including financial service giants BlackRock (BLK) and Goldman Sachs (GS), has buoyed crypto markets. They have made statements ""that crypto markets are worth dedicating more resources to,"" she said.  She highlighted the purchase over the past six days of $1.3 billion in bitcoin by the Singapore non-profit Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) as a reserve asset. The foundation is delivering on its month-old promise to add BTC as an additional layer of security for UST, which is Terra's decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoin. LFG has committed to purchasing at least $3 billion in bitcoin as reserves.  Acheson also spoke of a growing awareness – spurred partly by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine – of bitcoin as a ""seizure-resistant store of value."" ""What we are seeing in our headlines almost every day now (is) cases when this does matter to people,"" she said.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,575 +0.7%  DJIA: 34,955 +0.2%  Nasdaq: 14,354 +1.3%  Gold: $1,921 -1.8%  Insights  Intrigued by bitcoin but still confident in T-bills, gold  El Salvador’s ""Bitcoin Bond"" was supposed to be the first chapter of the next era of sovereign finance.  But the project seems to be in disarray, and analysis of the bond’s structure shows that it's not really a great deal for investors.  Bitcoin was marketed as the next major asset class for the balance sheet of the sovereign because of the questions surrounding the longevity of U.S. hegemony and the petrodollar that powers it.  Meanwhile, nations are still expressing confidence in U.S. Treasury bills as stores of value for their treasury. Some countries are even opting for these T-bills over gold, even while protesting against a U.S.-led, globalized world.  Data shows that since 2008, federal debt held by foreign and international investors has outpaced the price of gold. While there was a slowdown during the mid-2010s, it climbed back up as the decade came to a close and skyrocketed during COVID-19.  It’s not to say that many countries did not have an interest in gold. Far from it. Many states hit hard by COVID-19 lined their balance sheets with the precious metal. Thailand, Japan and India all had double-digit increases of their gold holdings throughout 2021.  El Salvador’s leadership claimed the bitcoin bond would provide the country a new way to finance debt that wasn’t tied to the International Monetary Fund and dollars. It would also be an asset that grows in value on the balance sheet, allowing for ambitious projects like a city powered by a volcano’s geothermal power. All this is possible, provided that bitcoin hits $1 million within the next five years.  And there’s one more caveat. The bond itself will not be issued by the El Salvadorian government, but by LaGeo, a subsidiary of the state-owned electricity company CEL. El Salvador says this is only a technicality; it’s still a debt of the sovereign.  With all the complications involved and bitcoin’s fragile price, this has been a terrible sales pitch for other nations. The reality is, data suggests nations don't really want anything aside from what they already have: low-yielding but safe Treasury bills, and some gold. Even China, which always threatens to dump its holdings, keeps a healthy supply on the books despite trimming the count.  Nayib Bukele’s plan to create an alternative to state-level financing, bypassing the IMF via bitcoin, isn’t without its merits. The IMF has long been criticized as a global loan shark and a lender of last resort. If the plan works, Bukele gets financing at a rate preferential to the IMF. Bitcoin-washing debt, like the green washing of the past, might be the hip new thing for developing countries if there really is $500 million in commitments already lined up.  But states are conservative creatures, especially in Asia, where bureaucracies can be slow-moving, and the memory of the Asian financial crisis is still fresh. Despite the dollar doomers and those that think America is on the verge of shattering into 50 pieces, Treasury bills are still in demand – and not even gold can usurp it. Good luck to bitcoin.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Breaks Above $46K, Resistance at $48K-$51K  Bitcoin (BTC) buying activity accelerated over the weekend as momentum signals turned positive.  The cryptocurrency broke above initial resistance at $46,000, although stronger resistance at the 200-day moving average, which is now at $48,289, could stall the relief rally.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is approaching overbought territory, similar to what occurred in October, which preceded a sell-off. This time, however, buyers appear to be targeting a 50% reversal of the four-month-long downtrend, which would yield additional upside toward $50,966.  Momentum signals on the weekly chart have significantly improved, which was previously seen at around the July low of $29,400. Still, momentum remains negative on the monthly chart, which could delay a significant price rally in the short term.

This signals another bull rally for the digital asset given how the market has responded to its recent surge.

42423650,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2cRRh,1648501847,The SEC's New Proposal to Redefine 'Dealer' Could Spell Bad News for DeFi,"A new proposal by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) aims to redefine what it means to be a securities dealer – a move industry experts say could cripple the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry.  The proposal would expand the definition of “dealer” to include people and businesses that use automated and algorithmic trading technology to execute trades and provide liquidity in the market.  While the proposal is, at least ostensibly, aimed at electronic traders of U.S. Treasurys – an issue the SEC has been wrestling with since at least 2014 – a footnote buried in the 200-page text says the proposed rule would also apply to digital assets that have been deemed to be securities.  Read More: Are Crypto Assets Securities?  Crypto lawyers have sounded the alarm on Twitter, calling the proposal an “all-out shadow attack on decentralized finance.”  Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at crypto research firm Delphi Digital, tweeted that if the proposal is accepted and the rule enforced, it could “kill the tech.”  The proposal would bring all automated market makers (AMMs) and liquidity providers with more than $50 million in total assets under management under the SEC’s regulatory umbrella and thus subject to the SEC’s registration requirements – something that would be impossible for many, if not all, decentralized exchanges.  Any decentralized exchange that fits the new criteria under the proposal and that didn’t register with the SEC could then, Shapiro argued, be declared an unregistered dealers, which is a felony offense under securities law.  Sneak attack  The inclusion of crypto as a single footnote in the massive proposal has been seen by some lawyers as a deliberate attempt to add confusion and uncertainty into the crypto markets.  Attempts to bring regulatory clarity to the industry have stalled, leaving the SEC to primarily regulate through enforcement.  “In a healthy rulemaking process, we wouldn’t have to guess at the SEC’s intent or its underlying goals,” Jake Chervinsky, head of policy at the Blockchain Association, tweeted.  Come in and register?  Attempts to remain compliant by many industry participants – including leading exchanges like Coinbase – have been met with vague requests by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and his staff to “come in and register” with the SEC.  Monday’s proposal, however, is being lambasted as a sign that the SEC’s offer was never genuine.  “This is an indicator of the bad faith entailed in the Commission’s ‘come in and register’ facade over the past few years,” tweeted crypto lawyer Collins Belton.  “The SEC has [zero] interest in DeFi participants ‘coming in & registering’,” Shapiro wrote on Twitter. “It’s a ban, not a registration requirement.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/28/the-secs-new-proposal-to-redefine-dealer-could-spell-bad-news-for-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04bc4bd00fce76f76b21e400d9d367f2d706b38d-8016x5327.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420974,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAoov,1648499105,"Money Continues to Pour Into GameFi, but Will Developers Follow?","Venture capital and retail investors are shoveling money into upstart crypto gaming projects, hoping the “GameFi” movement can spark a similar run to DeFi’s historic rise to over $200 billion in total value locked (TVL).  So far, however, the actual results have been mixed, with top gaming industry talent remaining divided on the prospects of “Web 3 gaming” – a banner term for games with built-in blockchain-based features such as non-fungible tokens (NFT) or in-game currency that can exist outside the walled garden of the game itself.  In the past year, investors have poured over $3.6 billion into crypto gaming startups, according to investment firm Drake Star Partners, and with this funding have come reports of GameFi companies luring top talent away from major gaming industry players.  For instance, Polygon Studios – the NFT and gaming arm of the Polygon blockchain protocol – recently made headlines for hiring Ryan Wyatt, the head of YouTube’s gaming vertical. The project has also poached top executives from Mythical Games, Riot Games and Amazon’s (AMZN) cloud gaming unit.  This hiring and funding spree in GameFi has not been without its critics, however, particularly from gamers who view the emergence of in-game NFTs and “play-to-earn” models as little more than a cash grab. In November 2021, EA CEO Andrew Wilson described NFTs as core to “the future of our industry on a go-forward basis,” but after backlash from fans and employees he changed his tune.  “Right now it’s not something we’re driving hard on,” he said in February, according to a report in gaming publication Kotaku.  That wariness also extends to the developer community, research shows. A January Game Developer Conference survey of over 2,700 game developers found 72% of developers characterized their companies as “not at all interested” in adding NFTs to their games. Additionally, according to the report’s authors, a “vast majority” of developers spoke out against “their potential for scams, overall monetization concerns and the environmental impact.”  Read more: Crypto Fans Rejoice, Gamers Revolt as Ubisoft Announces NFT Plans  Despite the mixed signals from industry professionals, multiple crypto gaming founders told CoinDesk he tide may be turning in a positive direction for the industry.  “We have not yet seen the talent drain that DeFi has, but in the last month alone I have seen an insane amount of talent go from Web 2 gaming into Web 3,” said Immutable founder Robbie Ferguson. “I think this will be one of the things that helps bridge the gap between how game designers view crypto gaming right now and how Web 3 views it.”  Top-down migration  Speaking to CoinDesk while in attendance at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Soban “Soby” Saqib, co-founder of NFT game platform Ex Populus, noted that the emergence of GameFi is just one of many macro trends to consider in the gaming industry.  “Think about movie studios: There’s no new [intellectual property] coming out. Same thing is happening in gaming, there’s no new IP. The gaming industry is going through the ‘Great Consolidation,’ people are being bought out and talent is being let go,” he said.  Indeed, the trend of major studio buyouts could be giving GameFi an opportunity to offer “a better life” with more freedom for ambitious game developers.  “People who have built out careers – worked 10, 20 years at Blizzard or Riot – you don’t think they have their own ideas they want to work on? We give people the opportunity to work on their own IP,” he said. “There’s only so much room to grow in a AAA studio.”  Ex Populus recently hired a director from the Netflix series “Love, Death and Robots” and has two unannounced, high-profile hires from major studios in the works – in part because the startup can offer more flexibility than a major studio, said Saqib.  There also may be an element of workers trying to catch an emerging trend early. Immutable’s Ferguson, who was also attending the GDC at the time of the interview, noted the majority of the talent drain is taking place “at the senior rung, where people are thinking strategically about where gaming is going.”  Read more: GameStop Taps Immutable X for NFT Marketplace, Launches $100M Gaming Fund  Immutable currently has 190 full-time employees, and is aiming to grow to 400 by the end of the year. Notable recent hires include Justin Hulog, former general manager of Southeast Asia at Riot, and Tommy Daniel, a former head of business development at Unity – and that senior-level mobility is a trend happening “across the industry,” Ferguson added.  The excess of VC funding doesn’t hurt, either: Immutable has “6x’d” their referral fees to over $20,000 for a successful hire, according to Ferguson.  “In general, Web 3 gaming is going to outpay Web 2 gaming by a significant margin,” he added.  When will GameFi break out?  The talent exodus at the executive level has yet to filter down to rank-and-file creative talent, but Ferguson believes it’s just a classic example of change happening slowly in the industry.  “Developer reluctance will absolutely slow adoption, but it’s just a normal part of the model of gaming shifting. We saw it with mobile gaming adoption, we saw it with free-to-play adoption – a large percentage of gamers hated the idea of free-to-play, but now it’s ubiquitous and commonly regarded as better for players. We’re going to see the same thing where people become passionate about how these games achieve better economies for players,” he said.  Loopify, the pseudonymous founder of blockchain gaming development studio Endless Clouds, told CoinDesk that publishing a big hit is easier said than done because of the combination of proficiencies it requires.  “I believe the hybrid of traditional devs joining crypto-native founders is what will create a good game,” they said. “The typical situation that I've seen is blockchain games that are currently being built either don’t have a strong team with experience working on games before or a clear vision.”  Read more: GameFi’s Promise and Reality Are Still Worlds Apart  All three founders CoinDesk spoke to pointed towards smaller-budget, “hungrier” studios as likely candidates for solving the puzzle of having a fun game with a functioning crypto-based internal economy, rather than from an incumbent gaming studio.  “The gaming industry is a copycat league,” said Ex Populus’ Saqib. “All we need is one really good NFT game, or even a team that comes in and really uses NFTs to support indie creators.”  Ultimately, the process of getting developers on board could mean that investors looking to corner the next macro trend need to practice patience – a hard truth for those who expect GameFi to mirror DeFi’s stunning rise.  “It just takes time to build games. When you consider that threshold that needs to be met, then you compare it to the attention deficit disorder that plagues crypto, it’s not a good match,” Saqib warned.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MATIC | RESEARCH,"Andrew Thurman, Sam Kessler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/28/money-continues-to-pour-into-gamefi-but-will-developers-follow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52c3b0a90c6b88aeb304b1f4676216e9461fffb9-3840x2743.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 15% over the past week, compared with a 16% rise in ether (ETH) and a 25% rise in Solana's SOL token over the same period. The rally in alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) relative to BTC reflects a greater appetite for risk among crypto investors.  Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why. Coming April 4.  Meanwhile, the S&P 500 was roughly flat Monday, versus a 6% rise in BTC over the past 24 hours. That suggests the recent rally in bitcoin can be explained by new token accumulation, which is unique to the crypto market.  Over the past six days, the Luna Foundation Guard’s (LFG) bitcoin wallet address purchased more than 27,000 BTC worth roughly $1.3 billion. The foundation is delivering on its month-old promise to add BTC as an additional layer of security for UST, which is Terra's decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoin.  Do Kwon, the foundation's director, confirmed the address to Bitcoin Magazine in an email, which was also marked by OKLink, a blockchain information website.  There appears to be a synergy between bitcoin and the Terra ecosystem, according to Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, a crypto data company. ""UST benefits from having additional backing and bitcoin benefits not just from the buying pressure, but also from having a stable medium of exchange backed by BTC,"" Outumuro wrote in an email to CoinDesk.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Spot driven move  Bitcoin's recent price bounce appears to be driven by demand in the spot market, which typically occurs around market turning points.  The chart below shows the rise in spot BTC volume versus futures volume, which has settled at around average levels over the past week.  In the futures market, open interest is rising and funding rates are slightly positive (at a one-week high). That indicates an increase in trading activity, albeit with weak conviction among BTC buyers.  The chart below shows an uptick in bitcoin trading volume across major exchanges, according to CoinDesk data. Prior volume spikes occurred during market sell-offs, which signaled capitulation among sellers.  At this stage, an increase in buy volume versus sell volume could determine if the price rally has staying power. Data from CryptoQuant shows a slight increase in the buy/sell volume ratio over the past week, which indicates bullish sentiment among bitcoin traders.  Altcoin roundup  Shiba Inu, Solana tokens lead gains with bitcoin: Major cryptocurrencies displayed gains after over two weeks of staying flat. Solana’s SOL jumped as much as 14%, with similar gains seen with Shiba Inu’s SHIB and Polkadot’s DOT tokens. A jump in SOL prices made it costly for traders betting against higher prices of the asset. Data shows nearly $30 million in liquidations occurred on SOL-tracked futures, according to CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa. Read more here.  NFTs could go mainstream with Instagram’s planned support: Bringing non-fungible-tokens to Instagram’s large audience has the potential to supercharge the overall market going mainstream, Deutsche Bank said in a research report on Sunday. Instagram will simplify the process of buying and selling NFTs, thereby lowering the barriers to entry, the bank said, adding that the platform’s strong global brand recognition will “lend itself to legitimatize NFTs, which could serve to erode buying hesitancy across the company’s broader audience,” analysts wrote, according to CoinDesk’s Will Canny.

Some 66% of all APE futures traders were short, or betting against higher prices for the recently issued token. These accounted for $2.8 million of all losses, while $1.4 million in gains were for traders who were long, or betting on higher prices, according to CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa. Read more here.

42423649,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2cRPh,1648498118,Crypto Privacy Positions Harden Ahead of Crunch EU Vote,"The crypto industry is sounding the alarm over new European Union rules due to be agreed Thursday, which they say would invade privacy and treat new technologies less fairly than cash or traditional bank transfers.  Those arguments don’t appear to have swayed key lawmakers, who remain adamant that tougher rules are needed to stop crypto being used to process dirty money. Others, however, have argued the proposals currently on the table could be unworkable or even unlawful.  Big players in the sector including Coinbase (COIN) have already come out swinging against the so-called travel rule, which would extend anti-money laundering identity checks to payments made in digital currencies, even if they are under an existing threshold of 1,000 euros ($1,098).  “This revision would unleash an entire surveillance regime on exchanges like Coinbase, stifle innovation, and undermine the self-hosted wallets that individuals use to securely protect their digital assets,” said Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal in a blog post on Monday.  “The truth is that digital assets are in general a markedly inferior way for criminals to hide their illicit financial activity,” he added, saying the immutable nature of blockchain technology makes it less attractive to those with something to hide.  Parliamentarians are also seeking to extend the checks to cover privately managed unhosted wallets that store crypto, despite fears that such rules could prove unenforceable. Paul Tang, one of the members of the European Parliament on the Economic Affairs Committee that will vote on the matter later this week, was unbowed by what he called a “social media storm by crypto bros.”  “Money going to unhosted wallets may end up in the wrong place, for example with terrorist groups,” Tang, a Dutch socialist, tweeted Monday, saying wallet owners would need to be identified just like bank customers are. Another reason to scrap thresholds, argues Tang, is ""smurfing,"" or the practice of coordinating small money transfers to escape threshold rules.  Tang and others may have been swayed by the views of national governments keen to scrap anonymity, and by officials who tell them crypto is used to fund terorrism and child porn. Others, though, argue that any decision they take could end up getting vetoed by judges. “The travel rule … is really a massive and indiscriminate personal data collection and transfer scheme,” said Mikołaj Barczentewicz, associate professor at the U.K.’s University of Surrey and Fellow of Stanford Law School, told CoinDesk in a written interview Monday.  Proponents of the new rules, Barczentewicz continued, are “saying that it is necessary for all crypto service providers to transfer sensitive data of their clients, even when there is not even the slightest suspicion of a criminal connection."" That privacy restriction “is very likely not as effective as less rights-restricting alternatives,” he said, even were the 1,000 euro limit maintained – and all the more so because those with nefarious aims could simply circumvent them.  Legally speaking, the claim the rules go further than they need to is not just a soundbite, he added. In a 2014 case, the EU’s highest court struck down laws requiring phone companies to keep call data, saying that the invasion of privacy went way beyond what was needed to help the police fight terrorism. “The analogy is very clear.""  If the new rules are passed and subsequently challenged in national courts, said Barczentewicz, “the EU Court of Justice will then have the power to invalidate the rules if it finds that they conflict with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights,” which safeguards the right to privacy.  “What we seem to be dealing with here is an attempt to do ‘something about crypto and crime,' without a serious, evidence-based reflection on how best to do it,” Barczentewicz concluded.

It has been gaining notoriety in the last few years, and DeFi is now an industry on its own. When we talk about the asset classes running the DeFi space, we cannot ignore wrapped assets, which are now a critical player in exploiting the multitude of use cases and functionalities in decentralized finance. This write-up will explain wrapped cryptocurrency assets in detail to help cryptocurrency and DeFi enthusiasts understand their importance and where they fit in the larger cryptocurrency industry. What are Wrapped Cryptocurrency Assets? A wrapped asset can be simply defined as a cryptocurrency token pegged to another asset. However, this definition makes wrapped assets much similar to stablecoins. For a more elaborate representation, a wrapped is a token that represents the original coin in a foreign blockchain. It is called a wrapped asset because the original crypto coin is put in a digital vault called the wrapper that allows it to exist on a non-native blockchain. The wrapped asset holds the same value as the original cryptocurrency, and apart from being used on other blockchains, some wrapped assets are redeemable for the original coin. Essentially, wrapped assets exist in two types. However, it is widely conceded that stablecoins were the first class of wrapped assets regardless of the massive differences.

42394267,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvap4Z,1648496743,Why There's Already a Will Smith Slap Token,"In the less than 24 hours since megastar Will Smith permanently damaged his public image by slapping Chris Rock, a man half his size, the cryptosphere has launched at least two projects purporting to somehow put the event on the blockchain. Despite no obvious logical connection between crypto and The Slap Heard Round the World, the newly minted digital assets even appear to have generated some sales.  But does that mean you should pile in? Absoluuuuuutely not.  Katie Notoupolos at BuzzFeed spotted something Monday morning called “Will Smith Slap DAO” selling non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the OpenSea marketplace (I’ll just be referring to it as SlapDAO). And, a token called “Will Smith Inu” has begun trading on UniSwap and other decentralized exchanges. (I will as usual avoid linking directly to suspicious projects.) Will Smith Inu saw a short, brief price surge overnight, and attracted about USD$1.9 million in trading volume.  That’s not as much as it might sound like. But for those new to the crypto space, it’s enough to invite some basic questions, such as What? and perhaps Why? Why would Will Smith approve such a thing? What possible reason could there be to buy it? Does this somehow make sense and I’m just missing some novel but well-known crypto business model?  The short answer to any and all such questions is ""Hold on a minute."" If you think these projects are legit or investable, it’s time to take a step back and brush up on some important crypto knowledge.  In fact, it may be the most important thing to know: Anyone can create a token and call it anything, and say anything they want to about it, and they’ll probably never get in trouble.  Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and other crypto systems have tools for quickly creating secondary tokens (ERC-20 or BEP-20, respectively). These have no inherent value, and it can take just minutes to launch a “new project” claiming some vague association with a public figure or cultural event.  This goes back at least to 2014, when Coinye West launched without any actual affiliation with rapper Kanye West. More recently, we’ve seen “Squid Game Token” capitalize on the Netflix hit, and the infinite variations on “Dogelon Mars” and “Elon Doge” attempting to capitalize on Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s profligate s**tcoinery.  Because the crypto market is global, and because you can sell more or less any token on a decentralized exchange (DEX), these shallow deceptions gain some trading momentum and volume. But they’re fundamentally tricks, and almost all of them collapse as fast as they rise.  See also: What Is a DEX? How Decentralized Crypto Exchanges Work  Kanye West, for his part, quickly sued the Coinye project into the dirt. But these things usually collapse without outside help. After the token shot up immensely in a few days, the “developers” behind Squid Game token abandoned it – a classic ""rug pull"" – and it dropped to zero. Expect these Will Smith Slap things to suffer a similar fate.  The broader takeaway is just as simple, and just as vital for anyone new to the space to internalize: Not all cryptos are created equal. Not by a long shot. And while “hot and new” is a positive feature in a lot of sectors, it’s often a bad thing in crypto, where the “Lindy Effect” appears to be quite strong. The Lindy Effect is an investing theory that the longer something has existed, the longer it will continue to exist. New cryptos, much like new companies, have a very high mortality rate.  Memes Without Meaning  There is also room for confusion between “memes” and “meme tokens.” They’re very, very different things.  “Memes” in general are hugely influential in crypto – in fact I’ve written an entire book about them. But memes are communication tools, not a value proposition or selling point in themselves. The good memes in crypto are condensations of much more complex ideas. “Bitcoin Maximalism” is a simplified meme – “Bitcoin (BTC) will become the world’s reserve currency.” It stands in for a much more complicated set of arguments, though, about the utility of a neutral digital currency layer, and Bitcoin’s unique positioning to be that layer.  Then there are, let’s just say it, the Bad Memes, which come in at least two varieties. There are memes that purport to represent more nuanced ideas, but are simply wrong (“XRP the standard”). There are also meme coins with no underlying deeper message at all, pure mindshare plays that slap a catchy image or a slogan on a token created from an open source algorithm and call it a day. Dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB), Coinye West and SlapDAO all fall in this category.  SlapDAO, like most of these empty signifiers, leans into winking self-awareness about its own ephemerality. It features lo-fi pictures of various Will Smith slaps from various angles, plastered with random low-IQ crypto slogans. They’re pretty funny, in a 4chan chud kind of way.  But however drenched in irony a project may be, the money is still real: As tracked by OpenSea, the definitely infringing Will Smith Slap DAO has sold 13.3 ether (ETH) worth of these destined to be short-lived NFTs in less than 24 hours. That’s more than $40,000 at current prices – arguably a sweet spot for short cons because it’s not enough to trigger much investigation.  (They’re destined to be short-lived because OpenSea, the 800-pound gorilla of NFT marketplaces, tends to delist infringing or scammy projects. The NFTs still exist after being delisted, but once they can’t be traded on OpenSea their value generally tanks.)  At the same time, those purchases might themselves be fake “wash trades” meant to create the impression there’s market interest and trick real traders into buying in. Wash trading is incredibly simple – you just use your own good crypto (BTC, ETH) to buy a fake or shoddy crypto asset you created, usually from a new wallet that slightly obscures the source of the funds. That fake buy drives up the markets’ perception of the “correct” price for your crummy asset, essentially tricking subsequent buyers.  Wash trading and other manipulation is extremely common in crypto, especially in new or unknown projects. There are few systematic and reliable ways to prevent or detect it. LooksRare, an NFT platform that sought to challenge OpenSea’s dominance, appears to have hosted rampant wash trading.  To be clear, I don’t have evidence this is happening with the Will Smith Slap assets, and given the smallish amounts involved, it seems plausible people are genuinely just piling in for a laugh. That’s another dynamic important to understand: Whether or not they're an outright scam, meme tokens are heavily traded by people who explicitly understand what they’re doing as a form of gambling.  The “game” of meme trading is usually to try to catch a very short “pump,” a price peak sometimes lasting just hours or even minutes, before a worthless token collapses to zero, usually forever. You mostly don’t want to trade against the self-identified “degens” who try and catch these pumps: they pride themselves on obsessiveness, sleeplessness and general lunacy.  See also: A Dictionary for Degens | Opinion  As a testament to just how many worthless crypto tokens already exist, there are also “slap”-themed cryptos that have nothing to do with Will Smith or the Oscars. A SLAP ERC-20 token that launched more than a year ago was supposedly linked to a dating service, but now appears to be dead. There’s a second unrelated token called ShibaSlap that launched in January as a naked and seemingly unsuccessful attempt to siphon off meme-coin interest. There are probably more.  The basic point is this: Anyone can create a digital token and they can call it anything they want. Then they can easily list it to a decentralized exchange without permission or approval from anyone. Then they can easily buy their own token from another wallet they control, creating the impression that there’s organic demand. Keep all of that in mind when pondering any crypto trade.",NEGATIVE,BTC | SHIB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,David Z.

42394271,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvapP5,1648495569,The Clumsy Theatrics of Metaverse Fashion Week,"The metaverse comes for every industry eventually, but fashion is more ready for it than most.  That’s because the logic of the non-fungible token (NFT) market is already informed by the logic of the fashion market. You can see it most clearly in streetwear: Before NFT drops, there were sneaker drops – limited edition releases positioned more as collector’s items than everyday apparel. Even more so than with a rare run of vinyl LPs, or a set of original prints from a visual artist, you’re supposed to flip those grails, those Jordans, those Red Octobers. The secondary markets are the point.  So it should hardly come as a surprise that dozens of high-profile fashion brands piled into something called “Metaverse Fashion Week” – essentially an online-only convention for clothing companies and crypto devotees – as an excuse to peddle digital collectibles.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Over a period of four days (don’t let the word “week” fool you), Metaverse Fashion Week played host to a series of virtual catwalks, cocktail parties, gallery openings and DJ sets; Perry Ellis, Dolce & Gabbana, Phillipp Plein and Tommy Hilfiger were among the featured designers, all of which were promoting their own digital fashion lines.  It all happened on a metaverse platform called Decentraland, which is like a buggier version of the online social space Second Life; on a tech level, it’s reminiscent of early 2000s Runescape, the fantasy role-playing game – a clunky take on an embodied chatroom.  Decentraland also comes with its own token, MANA, which players can use to purchase in-game outfits for their avatars in the form of NFTs or plots of digital land. If you want to interact at all with the platform’s native economy, you’ll need to shell out real dollars for these tokens (or earn them on the platform).  The market capitalization of MANA is now over $4 billion, despite the fact that Decentraland can only host 2,500 users at a time, per the tech blog New World Notes.  There were just around 1,000 people online when I logged in this weekend, split across servers (Decentraland calls them “realms”). As with massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like World of Warcraft, different servers host identical copies of the game, with different sets of players. It’s a way of reducing stress on the network; if you want to meet up with your friends in the virtual world, you’ll all need to be on the same server.  At a “Metaverse Cocktail Hour for Fashionistxs,” hosted by Cash Labs, it was abundantly clear who had MANA and who didn’t. My avatar was dressed plainly, with a default hairstyle and a default black turtleneck. Users with fancier gear – massive sets of wings, bear costumes, swarms of digital butterflies – stole the spotlight.  Virtual trinkets have always been a staple of online video games, but Decentraland isn’t exactly a game. It may take cues from games, but there’s not a lot you can actually do in this world beyond meeting up with people and typing short messages in a chat window.  One thing you can do is look at videos (usually advertisements) on virtual screens, though the experience of watching ads in the metaverse still feels clunky. The other major activities of Metaverse Fashion Week could be loosely described as “taking in the surroundings” in different contexts.  In this world, communication is limited. Only a few people seemed to be making use of the voice chat mechanism; most were content to jump up and down, wordlessly, in place.  A company called Auroborous capped off the weekend with a prepared DJ set from the musician Grimes. As music issued from a giant dancing creature meant to represent the producer herself, a host of smaller avatars – the onlookers – kept their eyes pinned to the stage.  See also: Metaverse Fashion Week: 70 Brands Do Their Best to Showcase Style in Decentraland  The performance, though it wasn’t exactly “live,” built on an established trend. In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when all the real-world concerts had been canceled, Travis Scott hosted an online-only concert within the video game Fortnite; Charli XCX and 100 Gecs were among the performers at a similar event in Minecraft; and Porter Robinson’s Secret Sky Festival attempted a more ambitious version of the same, with contributions from Doss and A.G. Cook.  Much of the novelty of these virtual events has to do with the inherent limitations of the online experience. In the first moments of the pandemic, we replicated physical experiences online as a kind of Band-Aid. Metaverse concerts weren’t a replacement for the real thing so much as a collective acknowledgement of a restricted situation. Part of the fun was in experiencing those glitchy, tactile environments together.  Metaverse Fashion Week, crucially, was lacking that sort of pull. The lineup promised multiple days’ worth of events – but what is it about this world that might compel someone to spend their entire weekend on it?  There’s something to be said for the accessibility aspect of Metaverse Fashion Week – you don’t have to be in Milan or New York to attend one of these events. In their current state, though, it’s hard to imagine fashion enthusiasts would want to.",NEUTRAL,MANA,BLOCKCHAIN | MANA | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/28/the-clumsy-theatrics-of-metaverse-fashion-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90a3907ed017dfa07a5a28a85dad67e2567ccbfb-2322x1573.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411829,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDjB,1648494744,Crypto Trading 101: The Moving Average Crossover,"If simple moving averages (SMAs) are your game as a crypto-trader, it's time to take it to the next level. In this piece, we will look at a strategy utilized by the moving-average elite – the ""crossover"".  By now you know how moving averages function, their specific purpose and the strategy used to determine if the trend is actually at an end or about to make a reversal. If not, then you should take some more time to study, getting to know the various ins and outs of SMA's on different time frames.  Moving on, the SMAs we discussed previously tend to move in relation to a set of data over a specified period of time, plotting a line on the chart that illustrates whether or not a trend is bearish or bullish – as well as the momentum behind certain price moves.  Detailing the cross-over  A moving average crossover occurs when two or more moving averages cross paths, confirming a shift in the market trend. They happen when large shifts in price action become manifest, pushing the lines up or down and, thus, causing them to cross.  You can see these events in action through the image below:  In the example, there are two simple moving averages (SMA's) ""crossing over"" on multiple occasions, whereby the faster SMA (21-period) passed over or under the slower one (55-period), thus confirming a bullish or bearish signal.  In the first example on the chart (left to right), we see how the 21-period SMA (white line) for bitcoin responded to a sharp move up in price crossing paths with the 55-period SMA (red line) from underneath.  From there, it maintained its position below the candlesticks and above the 55-period SMA until they met again two weeks later.  (Click here to learn why the two Fibonacci numbers were chosen.)  Notice in the second example how the candlesticks pass below the lines after crossing, confirming the price has turned bearish and that it is a good time to exit long positions.  This bearish trend lasted almost a month, from August 1 to August 23, during which time they met once more (example 3.), forming a weak bullish signal.  In order to spot the confirmation, in this case, a helpful tip would be to wait until the lines have parted far enough to your satisfaction, as this demonstrates a movement away from bearish conditions.  That brings us fourteen days ahead to example 4 on the chart when the lines crossed bearish, confirming the $1000 drop in price as a greater bearish move. The lines will remain that way until another crossover occurs and the faster SMA pushes up above the slower one in the never-ending cycle.  The bottom line is that there are many different variations of crossovers, from the stochastic oscillator to the MACD indicator. As well, there are different types of moving averages – simple, smoothed and exponential – that can work for you depending on the time-frame and asset.  These can be useful tools in your arsenal to equip you with a better understanding of the current trend, momentum in price action and whether or not to enter or exit a particular position.  While there are complex terminologies like 'golden cross', 'silver cross' and 'death cross' hovering around out there on the fringes of this narrative, it is best for now that you start familiarizing yourself with the basics in your journey to becoming a crossover master.  Is MA crossover a lagging indicator?  The critics of the moving average crossover strategy often point out that it is a ""lagging indicator,"" meaning it lags price or happens after a certain price move has appeared.  This line of reasoning has merit. Moving averages consider historical data and, hence, the longer the period of the moving average, the more it tends to fall behind price.  For instance, the much-feared ""death cross"" or the bearish crossover between the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA is considered by many as a ""contrarian indicator,"" meaning that by the time the positive crossover is confirmed, a major part of the rally has already happened, leaving the market vulnerable to profit-taking.  On similar lines, the""death cross"" or the bearish crossover between the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA is a big-time lagging indicator and often works the other way around.  However, that does not mean we should exclude MA crossover from the market analysis arsenal. The idea is to focus on the short-term crossovers for trend confirmation. For instance, the 5-day and 10-day MA crossover strategy is widely used for short-term trading.

Bitcoin Top 10 Exchange Inflows (Whales) Form A Peak Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC top ten exchange inflows have showed a bearish formation recently. The &apos;all exchanges inflow&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin entering wallets of all exchanges during a specific period. Investors usually deposit their BTC to exchanges for selling purposes. Therefore, any spikes in the metric can be bearish for the price of the crypto. A modification of this indicator is the &apos;top 10 exchange inflow,&apos; which measures the sum of the ten largest transactions going to centralized exchanges. As these transfers usually belong to whales, high values of the metric may be a sign of dumping from these massive Bitcoin holders. On the other hand, low top ten inflow values may suggest that whales are selling a normal amount of coins at the moment.

The jump, noted in a report Monday by CoinShares, marked a reversal of the recent trend that included two straight weeks of outflows.  The reversal came as the price of bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, rose 14% last week, its biggest weekly gain since last April.  Digital asset investment products saw $193 million in inflows in the seven days through March 25, said CoinShares. Inflows were led by European funds’ $147 million in inflows, with $45 million in inflows coming from American funds.  Among fund providers, CoinShares Physical led with an inflow of $91 million, while Purpose Bitcoin ETF had $16 million in outflows.  Solana-focused funds saw their largest single week of inflows at $87 million, making that kind of fund the fifth-largest investment product among crypto funds and the largest altcoin fund not focused Ethereum.  Meanwhile, $97.8 million flowed into bitcoin (BTC)-focused funds, $10.2 million went into Ethereum (ETH)-focused funds, and funds focusing on multi-assets had $5.5 million in outflows, which was unusual because multi-asset funds have been relatively popular; last week was only the second week this year when they had net outflows.  Cardano-focused funds saw inflows of $1.8 million, Polkadot-focused funds saw inflows of $1.2 million, and ATOM-focused funds saw inflows of $800,000.

It is not only an easy and practical way to secure blockchain networks but also a fool-proof way for users to earn high APYs in exchange for their participation via staking. However, the fact that staked assets remain locked for extended periods of time, limits their usability and deters many users from staking altogether. This is precisely why liquid staking as a means of unlocking liquidity of staked assets is being explored within DeFi, and leading the charge in this realm is the Tendermint/Cosmos-based Persistence network. Persistence empowers the creation of an ecosystem of products that help make liquid staking the default form of staking. And with the tokens $XPRT and $PSTAKE at the helm of operations to capture the value of this ever-growing ecosystem, the Persistence network is poised to become the epicenter for liquid staking in DeFi. A Symbiosis Like Never Before As mentioned before, Persistence is a layer-1 blockchain network that aims to build an ecosystem of products to promote liquid staking in the industry. For the uninitiated, liquid staking is a way of issuing tokenized versions or derivatives of staked assets to unlock their liquidity and allows them to be stored, transferred, used in DeFi, or spent just like any other tokens.

42375004,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw54Bb,1648487088,Biden Budget Proposal Estimates Additional $11B in Revenues by 2032 by Updating Crypto Rules,"U.S. President Joe Biden released his 2023 budget proposal on Monday, and in it, his administration is seeking to modernize rules around digital assets that it says would generate an additional $11 billion in revenues by 2032, as well as expand the Department of Justice’s ability to counter cyber threats that involve ransomware and the use of cryptocurrencies.  Among the digital asset rules the administration is looking to update are amending the mark-to-market rules to include digital assets; requiring reporting by certain taxpayers of foreign digital asset accounts; providing for information reporting by financial institutions and crypto brokers; and treating loans of securities as tax-free to include other asset classes and “address income inclusion.”  The administration estimates that modernizing these rules will bring in almost $11 billion in revenue between 2023-2032, with more than $4.8 billion coming from the first year of applying mark-to-market rules to digital assets.  The proposal also seeks to expand the DOJ’s budget by $52 million for “more agents, enhanced response capabilities, and strengthened intelligence collection and analysis capabilities” and noted that “These investments are in line with the Administration’s counter-ransomware strategy that emphasizes disruptive activity and combating the misuse of cryptocurrency.”  In the Department of the Treasury's explanations of the proposals, the mark-to-market changes would add actively traded digital assets and derivatives of these assets to a category that would be subject to such rules at the end of each year. Not all digital assets would qualify, however—only those that were determined to be regularly bought and sold for U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies, have enough volume to generate reliable valuations and have available reliable price quotes. The proposal would be effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2022.  As for the changes to rules for loans of digital assets, that would be updated as well. ""The market for lending of financial and other assets has expanded over time to include digital assets and interests in publicly traded partnerships,"" the Treasury explanation report said. ""The securities loan nonrecognition rules should be amended to take this expansion into account.""  The loan rule change proposal would ""amend the securities loan nonrecognition rules to provide that they apply to loans of actively traded digital assets recorded on cryptographically secured distributed ledgers, provided that the loan has terms similar to those currently required for loans of securities.""  UPDATE (March 28, 2022, 17:40 UTC): Updates to include Department of Treasury comments on loans of digital assets.

India’s Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said the figure was closer to 95.86 crore ($12.6 million) in a statement Monday.  Chaudhary was initially asked to detail the tax seizures by a member of India’s Parliament.  In January, DGGI only confirmed seizing funds from six crypto exchanges, including India's largest exchanges: WazirX, CoinDCX, BuyUCoin and Unocoin. On Monday, Chaudhary updated the figure to 11 exchanges.  In January, India’s tax authority had conducted searches on WazirX, CoinSwitch Kuber, CoinDCX, BuyUCoin and Unocoin after what it deemed to be tax evasion of Rs. 40.5 crore ($5.3 million). The tax authority said in a statement the case was part of a special anti-tax evasion drive.  The country is not just cracking down on tax evasion, but has also introduced tough new crypto tax rules. By April, 1 Indian crypto companies will have to pay a capital gains tax of 30% on crypto transactions.

The company reported full-year revenue of $169 million for 2021, up 383% versus 2020.  Operating income in Q4 was $15 million, and net income was $10 million, or $0.05 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $44 million, or 74% of revenue, up from $32 million, or 71% of revenue in Q3. The company mined 1,045 bitcoin (BTC) in Q4 at an average price of $8,000 per coin versus an average of $7,500 a year earlier.  For comparison, Marathon Digital – one of the larger miners in the world – had blended mining costs of $5,087 per coin, according to an investor presentation.  Turning to the balance sheet, Bitfarms as of year-end held $126 million in cash and 3,301 bitcoin valued at about $153 million (based on price of $46,300). The company raised $113.9 million in Q4 via the sale of 17.6 million shares through its at-the-market (ATM) program with H.C. Wainwright. Since the start of 2022, the Canadian miner raised another $25.6 million through ATM share sales.  On January 6, the Canadian miner purchased another 1,000 bitcoin for $43 million to add to its BTC treasury holdings.  As of March 25, the company had boosted its hashrate to 2.7 exahash per second (EH/s) versus 2.2 EH/s at the end of the year. Management believes existing miner orders and contracted infrastructure expansion should allow hashrate of about 7.2 EH/s by the end of 2022. The company target is 8.0 EH/s by year-end, and Bitfarms is looking at further development opportunities in order to be able to achieve this.

42375015,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw54PR,1648476788,US Lawmakers Introduce 'ECASH' Bill in New Push to Create a Digital Dollar,"A group of U.S. lawmakers says the U.S. Treasury Department may be the right government entity to create a digital dollar – not the Federal Reserve. A new bill introduced Monday would authorize just that.  Reps. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), Jesús Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) introduced the ""Electronic Currency And Secure Hardware Act"" (ECASH Act) to direct the Treasury Secretary to develop and issue an electronic version of the U.S. dollar, with an eye to preserving privacy and anonymity in transactions.  The electronic dollar, as defined in the bill, would be a bearer instrument that people could hold on their phone or a card. The system would be token-based, not account-based, meaning if someone were to lose their phone or card, they would lose the funds. In other words, it would be like losing a wallet with dollar bills in it.  This electronic dollar would be deemed legal tender and be functionally identical to a physical greenback.  Rohan Grey, an assistant professor at Willamette University who consulted on the bill, told CoinDesk the bill is meant to create a true digital analogue to the U.S. dollar.  “We’re proposing to have a genuine cash-like bearer instrument, a token-based system that doesn't have either a centralized ledger or distributed ledger because it had no ledger whatsoever. It uses secured hardware software and it's issued by the Treasury,"" he said.  This form of e-cash would support peer-to-peer transactions, and given the nature of its setup, it would support fully anonymous transactions.  Thus, it would differ from other proposals for a digital dollar, which are based on stablecoins or other decentralized ledger tools. Blockchains are designed to track every transaction, and any transaction could be therefore tied to the sender and receiver.  Under Lynch's proposal, users wouldn't be subject to any more severe know-your-customer rules than anyone trying to use cash. They would have to acquire the e-cash dollars via a bank account, peer-to-peer transaction or a store, but could then do whatever they liked with it.  Grey said this system could serve people who are unable to hold bank accounts because of minimum balance requirements or those who don't trust banks because banks may charge fees or freeze funds.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/28/us-lawmakers-introduce-ecash-bill-in-new-push-to-create-a-digital-dollar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d6777c61f129d7f655a43770eb474b0f32a6f8b-4811x2987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One of the quiet ones to watch may well be Tezos, an open-source and eco-friendly blockchain that first went online four years ago and has, until recently, managed to stay under the radar.

That hard work has paid off. In the last year Tezos has emerged as one of the darlings of the DeFi space.

The funding will go toward a development program, talent retention and go-to-market activities.  Investors included game-focused crypto investment firm Animoca Brands, major game publisher Ubisoft, Polygon (the blockchain powering the game) and Sebastian Borget, co-founder and COO of The Sandbox.  Blockchain gaming is a flourishing area of the crypto industry often viewed as the way to bring the next big wave of people into crypto. In January, the number of active blockchain games had doubled from the prior year to nearly 400. Crypto exchange giant FTX launched its own gaming unit in February, and last week announced the acquisition of Good Luck Games, maker of the free-to-play card battle game “Storybook Brawl.”  'Cross the Ages' universe  ""Cross the Ages"" is a mobile-first collectible card game set in a dystopian future based on a series of free-to-read novels, the first of which is already available. Players compete individually and in teams for NFTs and have the option of converting digital cards into physical copies.  The game is slated to add metaverse elements by mid-2023, including quests based on clues in the novels. Developers, artists and gamers will also have the ability to create new cities and games.  The beta version of the CTA game will launch in late May followed by digital and physical cards in June. CTA will then debut an NFT marketplace and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols suite, the latter of which will give users access to farming, pooling and bonding for optimized trading options within the game’s infrastructure.  “The CTA DeFi product will be accessible via the main user interface, but it will operate as its own standalone platform,” CTA co-founder and CEO Sami Chlagou told CoinDesk in an email. “We want to keep the gaming experience somewhat separate to ensure that the more commercial aspects of the CTA experiences do not distract from what will be a dynamic and unique metaverse gaming experience.”  The CTA team currently stands at over 140, which includes artists, authors, developers and business experts. The team is expected to grow to over 200 by the end of this year and potentially as large as 250 by mid-2023, said Chlagou.  Singapore-based CTA is headed by co-founder and Chairman Christophe de Courson, who has worked in blockchain technology and venture capital, and Chlagou, who is also the owner of game producer Pixel Heart, which has produced more than 50 games for platforms such as Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation.  “Sami's vision of 'Cross The Ages' around creating an innovative, multidimensional entertainment format which players can participate in and own – between books, collectible trading cards in both physical and NFT formats and video gaming – is truly unique, and he has not only a top-notch team, but also a track record of successfully shipping games,” said The Sandbox’s Borget in a statement.

Iris Energy had an average operating hashrate of 844 petahash per second in February and plans to reach 10 EH/s by early 2023. It also has secured a total of 15 EH/s worth of mining machines.

The financing comes as crypto miners are looking to get creative with their capital needs, including raising funds through bitcoin-backed loans and asset-backed loans that are tied to the companies’ mining rigs.

42375017,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw54Qh,1648473189,First Mover Americas: Ether Hits 2.5-Month High as Google Search Shows Peak Interest in 'Ethereum Merge',"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin jumps to $47,000, confirming a bullish breakout. Ether taps two-and-a-half-month highs as popular interest in Etheneum's impending proof-of-stake upgrade surges.  Featured stories: A section of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverts, signaling economic recession ahead.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Bill Barhydt, CEO, Abra  David Ripley, COO, Kraken  Dyma Budorin, co-founder and CEO, Hacken  Samir Kerbage, chief technology officer, Hashdex  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Cryptocurrencies gained ground early Monday, shrugging off the cautious mood in traditional markets.  Bitcoin jumped above $47,000, triggering over $300 million in short liquidations, according to data provided by Swiss-based crypto derivatives tracking platform Laevitas.  According to observers, continued purchases of bitcoin by the Luna Foundation Guard, a nonprofit organization focused on stablecoin UST, helped the cryptocurrency break out of its two-month triangular consolidation.  ""Increased holding by long-term investors backs the recent rise in the cryptocurrency's price. As BTC surpasses $47,000 again, the balance held by hodlers - addresses holding >1year, is currently at ATH [all-time high],"" blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock tweeted. ""Hodlers increased their positions by 17% since late November. These addresses remained unfazed and accumulated throughout Q1 of 2022.""  Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, tapped two-and-a half-month highs near $3,350. ""FOMO (fear of missing out) is kicking for ETH pre-merge,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email.  Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge general or retail interest in trending topics, recently showed a peak value of 100 for the worldwide search query ""Ethereum Merge"" for the past 12 months.  Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of actual search requests made to Google and scales the searches on a range of 0 to 100, according to the company. The search value represents the search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the selected region and time.  ""There’s been an increasing amount of mainstream coverage about the Ethereum merge, particularly around how it will lead to ETH’s supply decreasing,"" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, said in a weekly newsletter published Sunday. ""Additionally, the reduced environmental impact coming from the transition to proof of stake has also began making news.""  Peak popular interest doesn't necessarily imply an increase in actual buying pressure from retail investors as people often search for information but don't act. That said, investors could step in this time, given that ether is fast gaining ground and analysts are making bullish predictions on the second-largest cryptocurrency.  Tokens associated with smart contract blockchains like Polkadot and Solana registered double-digit gains on a 24-hour basis. Web 3 heavyweights FIL, THETA and GRT rose 27%, 15% and 12%, respectively.  The regulatory risk was back on the table with the European Union likely to vote on stricter rules for private wallets as part of anti-money-laundering checks, including scrapping the €1,000 ($1,100) limit for reporting transfers, Solot said.

The spread between yields on the 30- and five-year government bonds fell under zero for the first time since 2006 – a year before the great financial crisis of 2007-2008.  The spread between the 10- and two-year yields, another widely tracked section of the yield curve, was 12 basis points short of inversion at press time.  An inverted yield curve is widely read as a sign of impending economic recession, a significant decline in economic activity that lasts for months or even years. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the yield curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with the economy taking a hit between six and 24 months following the inversion.  The recession hint provided by the latest curve inversion could have bearish implications for bitcoin. While the cryptocurrency hasn't develop strong links to economic activity yet, it has evolved as a macro asset since the coronavirus crash of March 2020 and tends to move in line with risk assets, mainly technology stocks, which are sensitive to economic cycles.

42375018,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw54Rx,1648470571,"Shiba Inu, Solana Tokens Lead Gains as Bitcoin Hovers Over $47K","Bitcoin (BTC) held over the $47,000 mark during the European hours on Monday following a surge from Sunday’s $44,700 level, leading to a broader recovery and a 5.4% addition or $100 billion to the overall capitalization of the crypto markets, in the past 24 hours.  Some funds attributed bitcoin’s surge to demand generated by Luna Foundation Guard (LFG). The LFG intends to accumulate $3 billion in bitcoin as a reserve for TerraUSD (UST), a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, and has purchased $125 million worth of the asset multiple times in the past week.  Major cryptocurrencies displayed gains after over two weeks of staying flat. Solana’s SOL jumped as much as 14%, with similar gains seen on Shiba Inu’s SHIB and Polkadot’s DOT tokens. SOL set monthly highs of $110, data show, while SHIB was in touching distance of its monthly highs of $0.00002788.  A jump in SOL prices made it costly for traders betting against higher prices of the asset. Data show nearly $30 million in liquidations occurred on SOL-tracked futures. Bitcoin futures racked up $172 million in losses, the most among all cryptocurrencies, while ether futures followed with $139 million.  The losses added to nearly $455 million in overall liquidations in the crypto market. Liquidation occurs when a trader has insufficient funds to keep a leveraged trade open.  Traders say $50,000 is the next target for bitcoin  Analysts cautioned against euphoric sentiment for bitcoin as sentiment indicators suggested a correction could be on the cards.  “The Crypto Fear and Greed index has reached 60 which is classified as Greed – the last time it reached this level Bitcoin was around $60,000,” explained Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at crypto broker GlobalBlock, in an email to CoinDesk. The fear and greed index calculates investor sentiment, with “greed” readings leading to a high probability of an imminent correction and “fear” readings preceding a period of the uptrend.  But Sotiriou expects prices to move much higher in the coming days. “Bitcoin is facing heavy resistance, but if it is able to hold above the $46,000 level (which roughly marks the yearly open) for several days, I expect a move to $52,000, which is the next key resistance,” he said in the email.  Several other analysts shared similar price targets for bitcoin.  “A sustenance of the current growth track can push the price of BTC above $50,000 before the end of the week and between the $50,000 to $55,000 range before mid-April,” said Alexander Mamasidikov, co-founder of mobile digital bank MinePlex, in a Telegram message.  Vasja Zupan, president of Matrix Exchange, seconded that sentiment. “It could be a sign that markets are beginning to recover from the initial shock of the Ukraine war,” he said in a Telegram message. “Bitcoin will disconnect from the tech stock markets and serve as a hedge in an inflationary environment as digital gold. The first goal is $50,000.”  Crypto entrepreneurs like Zupan are back to much higher estimates of bitcoin’s future prices. “I wouldn't be surprised if we hit 100k before the end of the year, regardless of the geopolitical situation,” he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SHIB | SOL,BTC | MARKET | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/28/shiba-inu-solana-tokens-lead-gains-as-bitcoin-hovers-over-47k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/588693aacb7b68f337d7bd249b98bc2e9e28c6f1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following last week's Group of Seven summit in Belgium, Kishida in parliament on Monday called for amendments to Japan's Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno - speaking at a press conference - promised revisions would soon be submitted to lawmakers, the report said.  Speaking with Reuters, a finance ministry official said discussions had already begun on the proposed changes.  The revisions are aimed at strengthening protections against Russia trying to evade sanctions with digital assets.

Starting from April 2021, the XLM price is clearly moving in a wedge. The first fall wave within this wedge began in May 2021 and was quite aggressive. The weakness of the second fall wave from November 2021 is expressed both in the lazy local lows update and in trading volumes. At the moment, buyers are able to organize deep corrections up, and sellers are unable to aggressively update local lows. This trend is leading to a global market reversal. https://www.tradingview.com/x/ddjxPY0M/ The worst-case scenario at the time of writing is the retention of $0.27 by sellers and another fall wave to $0.13. This scenario is quite real, given the trading volumes in the weekly timeframe. However, even such trouble for investors will not be a problem to start forming a new growth wave with the first global target of $0.4.

42375014,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw54OB,1648467842,Recession Signals Light Up as Section of US 'Yield Curve' Inverts,"While bitcoin's bullish breakout has brought cheer to the crypto market, the U.S. bond markets appear to signal an economic recession, a bearish cue for risk assets.  Data tracked by charting platform TradingView shows that a section of the Treasury yield curve inverted early on Monday. The spread between yields on the 30- and five-year government bonds fell under zero for the first time since 2006 – a year before the great financial crisis of 2007-2008.  The spread between the 10- and two-year yields, another widely tracked section of the yield curve, was 12 basis points short of inversion at press time. A yield curve is a graphical representation of expected returns from bonds of different maturities. Yields have an inverse relationship with bond prices – as price increases, yields fall.  An inverted yield curve is widely read as a sign of impending economic recession, a significant decline in economic activity that lasts for months or even years. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the yield curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with the economy taking a hit between six and 24 months following the inversion.  The recession hint provided by the latest curve inversion could have bearish implications for bitcoin. While the cryptocurrency hasn't developed strong links to economic activity yet, it has evolved as a macro asset since the coronavirus crash of March 2020 and tends to move in line with risk assets, mainly technology stocks, which are sensitive to economic cycles.  At press time, bitcoin showed no signs of panic, trading 0.8% higher on the day at $47,200. Early Monday, prices escaped a two-month narrowing price range, opening doors for an extended move to the higher side.  The futures tied to the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, traded flat, signaling a dull opening.  The latest curve inversion perhaps indicates that bond traders are skeptical about the Fed's ability to control inflation without causing a recession. On one hand, rate hikes suck liquidity and help pull down inflation; on the other hand, they weigh over consumer and corporate spending and disrupt the virtuous economic cycle of high spending and high growth.  ""Look at the massive flattening in the 2y10y -- it's signaling that the Fed's ability to engineer a soft landing is quite narrow,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, told CoinDesk in an email early this month after the Fed raised rates by 25 basis points and made the case for rapid tightening in the coming months.  Interest rate derivatives traders are now anticipating an increase in interest rates by 218 basis points by the end of the year. That's equivalent to nine 25-basis point rate hikes over the next six Fed meetings.  Last week, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester called for faster monetary policy tightening via interest-rate hikes in increments of 0.5 percentage point (50 basis points).  Why inverted yield curve represents recession fears?  The yield curve doesn't cause recession by itself and only represents how bond traders see the economy evolving over the coming years.  The yield curve inverts when traders sell short-term bonds and park money in long-term bonds. It's a sign that investors expect long-term interest rates to decline, which typically happens during economic slowdowns or recessions.  Sometimes, expectations of rapid rate hikes in the short term drive investors away from bonds maturing in one to five years, leading to an inverted curve. For instance, the two-year and five-year yields have seen bigger rallies this year than the 10- and 30-year yields.  The curve is usually upward sloping, with longer-duration bonds offering a higher yield than short-duration ones. That's because both the risk of investments falling in value and growth prospects are higher with longer-duration bonds than with shorter ones.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/28/recession-signals-light-up-as-section-of-us-yield-curve-inverts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/172ea972e20fff52f7463fa22b1f81b7476e3372-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ENJ weekly candle from 21 December closed 25% above the opening price. The candle closed almost without a pin and buyers did not need a large amount of volumes. Buyers have not had such a great result since December 2021. The precondition for this was a failed attempt by sellers to take control of the $1.3 range. In history, we see that the local downward trend, which sellers began in November 2021, began to slow down to around $1.3. It was an unsuccessful attempt to break this mark and a weak update of the local low during the week of 21 February signaled the weakness of sellers in this range. The first problem of buyers on the way to the formation of medium-term growth trend is around $2.34. https://www.tradingview.com/x/cQo0BI4N/ It is at this point that the price slowed down throughout December. And after the breakdown of this mark, the fall of the ENJ price accelerated. However, a rebound of the ENJ price from $2.34 will not mean the end of the buyers&apos; initiative. We expect a local test of $1.6 and continued price growth to $3.86. At the moment, this is considered a pessimistic scenario. However, given the fact that the BTC price is one step closer to breaking the consolidation up, it is possible that the continued uncorrected growth of ENJ.

Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of Internet Computer is $514 Million, marking a 325% rise. Past Performance of ICP ICP coin price shows a falling wedge pattern breakout resulting in a price jump of 40% last week.

However, one industry that&apos;s seen incredible growth over the past 20 years and continues to do so is gaming - which currently has a total value of nearly 200 billion USD. But, when you take a step back and realize that there are 3.2 billion gamers worldwide, 2.2 billion of which actively play through their mobile devices, it&apos;s no surprise that this industry has such high revenues.

India's top court asked Ajay Bhardwaj, the brother of Amit Bhardwaj, another suspect who is deceased, to disclose the information to India's Enforcement Directorate, a government agency that fights financial crime.  The GainBitcoin scam is one of India's biggest bitcoin crimes ever. According to court documents, the scam is valued at 80,000 bitcoins, which is worth about Rs 20,000 crore, or $3.8 billion.  In a hearing on Monday, Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, a government lawyer, said, ""This has nothing to do with the legality of cryptocurrency and the username and password is crucial in this matter.""  The Supreme Court, which is led by Justice DY Chandrachud, asked Bhardwaj to cooperate in the investigation and provide the username and password of his crypto wallet.  Deepak Prakash, Ajay Bhardwaj's lawyer, told CoinDesk that his client doesn't know the username and password of his late brother's crypto wallet and said Ajay Bhardwaj himself has an almost unused crypto wallet and will cooperate with authorities.  The top court was hearing a petition filed by Ajay Bhardwaj seeking to quash the GainBitcoin case against him. He and his deceased brother, Amit, are alleged to have offered a return of 10% on bitcoin for 18 months.  The court also extended interim protection to Ajay Bhardwaj from arrest.

Earlier this month, Meta Platforms (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company was “working on bringing NFTs to Instagram in the near term.”  Instagram will simplify the process of buying and selling NFTs, thereby lowering the barriers to entry, the bank said, adding that the platform’s strong global brand recognition will “lend itself to legitimatize NFTs, which could serve to erode buying hesitancy across the company’s broader audience.”  NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items and that can be sold or traded.  The launch of an NFT marketplace on Instagram, which is owned by Meta, is highly likely to gain traction, the report said. Based on typical NFT marketplace fees and conservative assumptions about user penetration and average transaction values, the bank estimates that a broader rollout of an NFT marketplace on Instagram could drive up to $8 billion in net annual revenue.  Other internet companies are also taking steps to adopt digital assets, as eBay (EBAY), Twitter (TWTR) and Snap (SNAP) could all incorporate NFTs to some degree, the note said.  The NFT market is in “hypergrowth mode,” the report said, generating around $25 billion in transaction volume last year, an increase of about 250 times from the total volume of around $95 million seen in 2020.  Deutsche Bank says the market opportunity for NFTs is very large, with the total addressable market (TAM) estimated to be over $1 trillion, led by such categories as art, collectibles and gambling.

42375012,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw54Mv,1648456789,"Bitcoin Could Reach $53K on Triangle Break, Impending Bull Cross, Analysts Say","Bitcoin's (BTC) escape from a prolonged consolidation has traders tracking chart patterns calling an extended move to the higher side.  The top cryptocurrency by market value topped $47,000 early Monday, confirming a breakout from a two-month triangular pattern defined by trendlines connecting Feb. 10 and March 2 highs and Jan. 25 and Feb. 24 lows.  ""The triangle breakout has opened up upside toward resistance at $53,000,"" Daniel Kukan, senior cryptocurrency trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, said in a Telegram chat.  Triangles, which represent a steady narrowing of the trading range, form when bulls and bears are unwilling to lead the price action. So, traders and chart analysts consider an eventual escape from the triangle in either direction a hint of a beginning of a new bull or bear run.  ""Decisive breakout on bitcoin this morning. A big base pattern completed above $45,855 (although needs a [UTC] close above to confirm),"" market analyst Richard Perry tweeted. ""This implies a test of $52,00 resistance and a projected target towards $57,400 in the next few months.""  Fundamental and macro strategists often criticize technical analysis as unreliable as chart patterns and indicators often fail. Even so, it is hard to ignore. With so many people believing in the charts, the breakouts or breakdowns often become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The chart above shows that a bull cross between the 50- and 100-day simple moving averages (SMA) could soon happen, strengthening the positive case presented by the triangle breakout.  A bull cross happens when a short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, indicating a bullish shift in the momentum. Bitcoin jumped from $44,00 to $52,000 in the weeks after the 50- and 100-day SMAs crossed bullish on Aug. 19 last year.  While crypto Twitter has livened up on prospects of a big move higher, some observers take a measured approach to making bullish forecasts.  ""The breakout above $45,000 provides more confidence that a reversal is in play, but our preference is to be cautious since the move was partly driven by advancement in stock markets,"" Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.  In other words, the cryptocurrency hasn't decoupled from stocks yet, and renewed risk aversion in traditional finance, if any, could play spoil sport.  While bitcoin has risen nearly 20% since the Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs by 25 basis points on March 16, the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, has jumped 5.9%, data provided by charting platform TradingView show.  Neo foresees profit-taking at around the psychological level of $50,000, which coincides with the widely tracked 200-day SMA. ""It wouldn’t surprise us to see profit-taking on those levels by short-term traders who went long the past few weeks,"" he said.  The bullish technical outlook would be invalidated if the cryptocurrency drops under support at $43,000, Crypto Finance AG's Kukan noted.  Bitcoin was recently trading near $47,000, representing a 0.4% gain on the day and 1.4% gain for the year.
