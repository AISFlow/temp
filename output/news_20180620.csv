42380903,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92XkL,1529531720,Crypto Cries Foul In Wake of Tether's Dollar Token Report,"Too good to be true?  That's what some are wondering after Tether, the makers of the dollar-pegged crypto asset, USDT, made an announcement Wednesday insisting that its tokens – valued at $2.6 billion – are fully-backed by real cash (according to one law firm, at least).  For months, Tether has fought accusations that it is falsely issuing tokens without actually having the dollar reserves to back them. The company had even initially partnered with an audit firm to undergo a full inspection. That working relationship, however, was dissolved back in early January.  Some background on Tether: Unlike bitcoin or ethereum, which do not have traditional assets affirming its value, USDT can boast a relatively secure store of value being pegged to the dollar. As such, investors view USDT as less of an investment and more of a tool to move funds from one cryptocurrency exchange to another.  Sounds ingenious, right?  The problem is that if allegations over Tether not having the funds to back their tokens are indeed true, there's less money than is currently being depicted in the cryptocurrency markets and in fact more reason to believe cryptocurrency prices are inflated.  So, bringing this story back around to the latest announcement, the general consensus is that no, the claim still can't be proven.  As explained by @Bitfinexed, a well-known critic of the company, the issue with the review is that it isn't really an audit.  This is important to note because audits are generally held to a greater degree of accountability and integrity than legal reviews, which is what many are saying needs to be done for claims of tether's reliability to be even remotely affirmed.  Nonetheless, amidst the chatter, there are still those who see this legal review as one more reason to keep on using Tether's token.  Still, there are those who see even this announcement as one that is ill-intended, labeling it just another way USDT is boosting (or manipulating) the price of cryptocurrencies in general.  Warning: proceed with caution  The concern over price manipulation is especially timely given a study published this week alleging that USDT was an active instrument used by investors to boost the price of bitcoin in times of market downturns.  Not to mention that USDT is a cryptocurrency closely linked to cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which, like Tether, has a history riddled with hacks, lost funds and a resistance to greater transparency.  The worry over the increased impact of Tether and, by consequence, Bitfinex, has caused outcry on social media by notable voices such as the creator of litecoin Charlie Lee, and professor at NYU Stern School of Business, Nouriel Roubini.  For its part, Tether seems well aware of the concerns voiced on social media and recent reports.  The company wrote in a blog post on their official webpage that their efforts in ""transparency"" are far from over and that they will continue with ""steps aimed at opening up Tether to the general public and clearing away any uncertainty that may exist.""

42380900,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92XgZ,1529525727,Trump Official Argues for 'Sweet Spot' in Crypto Regulation,"The U.S. government needs to find the ""sweet spot"" in its oversight of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, Mick Mulvaney, acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said on Wednesday.  Speaking at the Future of Fintech conference hosted by research and analysis firm CB Insights, Mulvaney, who also heads the Office of Management and Budget, touted his pro-bitcoin credentials, noting that he is fiscally conservative and ""was one of the founding members of the bitcoin caucus and blockchain caucus.""  Sympathies aside, he argued that regulation is important to protect investors – but the government should not discourage potential investors or developers from entering the market through burdensome laws or regulations.  Mulvaney explained:  ""We knew at an early point in bitcoin that as with any developing financial technology we needed to find that sweet spot … if Mt. Gox became a regular occurrence it dramatically undermines confidence in the markets and prevents innovation. And if we over-regulate and discourage people from entering the marketplace, that has bad consequences too.""  In other words, Mulvaney said, ""we're looking for that Goldilocks [path] in the middle.""  He explained the concerns that might arise with a lack of investor protection, saying: ""It's a new and innovative technology, it's a nonbanking system, it's whatever. If people still can't get access to their own money, that's a problem. So the law's functioning correctly there.""  What Mulvaney is trying to accomplish now, he argued, is ensuring that the application of an existing law doesn't lead to unintended consequences.  ""If for some reason we're looking at you and the only way we can look at you is through the lens of the bricks and mortar financial institution, and because we do that it has this perverse or absurd result, that's what we're trying to identify and to prevent,"" he said.

According to the memo, the committee determined that cryptocurrencies are ""other forms of securities for purposes of the EIGA (Ethics in Government Act) and financial disclosure with respect to individuals who are subject to financial disclosure requirements and who file their reports with the Clerk of the House.""  It's a notable determination and one that was issued on the same day that the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) – the ethical watchdog of the federal government – said in its own guidance release that public officials must disclose their crypto-holdings. The House memo was first reported by Bloomberg.  Whether this policy will extend to the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, remains unclear. A representative for the Senate Ethics Committee was unavailable for comment.  Notably, the document also touches on initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales. As it stands, the committee said that ""it is unclear which ICOs, if any, may be considered to be 'the subject of an initial public offering' for purposes of the IPO prohibition.""  As a result of the STOCK Act, members of Congress are prohibited from taking part in any kind of special-access security offerings that aren't extended to the general public.

The co-founder of the investing app and web platform was bullish on bitcoin despite the price declines seen over the last few months, saying ""this asset has staying power, significant staying power.""  Tenev noted that bitcoin's price, in particular, has fluctuated in similar patterns before, adding:  ""It's very foolish to say bitcoin is done.""  Robinhood, a micro-finance investing app which sought to open access to stock trading to the general public, jumped on the cryptocurrency wagon earlier this year, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  Tenev said Wednesday that ""around that time a lot of the biggest crypto exchanges and brokerages a lot of the exchanges … were just not staying up. [They were] down for days at a time. [We're] focused on stability and reliability. We were able to sustain the customer orders … hundreds of thousands of accounts [added in a single day].""  At present, according to Tenev, the company is trying ""to get people into the overall ecosystem.""  ""What we've seen a lot is people hearing about us because of crypto, opening accounts … and become sort of customers of the entire Robinhood ecosystem,"" he said.  That being said, ""blockchain as a concept has become a little bit over-rated,"" he noted, explaining that startups are trying to jump on the bandwagon by using decentralized ledgers where a normal database would suffice.

42380888,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92XRT,1529510433,Enigma Protocol to Integrate Smart Contracts Tech With Intel Systems,"Intel is working with blockchain startup Enigma to help secure its privacy-enhancing smart contracts.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, secret contracts are a type of smart contract for public blockchains that use cryptographic tricks to keep transaction data hidden from view. Enigma – a startup that grew out of efforts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with the goal of creating a more private platform for decentralized applications – wants to boost their privacy by incorporating Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), a move slated for the second half of 2018.  An Enigma spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""Privacy is currently the biggest barrier to smart contract adoption. Blockchains are good at correctness, but bad at privacy by design. Smart contracts and decentralized applications will need to be able to use private and sensitive data to see global adoption.""  Enigma plans to work with Intel and other industry partners to develop applications that support the protocol and SGX, later this year launching a proof-of-concept that showcases the potential of combining the two technologies.  Both teams are also conducting R&D into trusted execution environments (TEEs), which are an integral part of Intel's SGX technology that securitizes data and code. Specifically, TEEs refer to space on a device's main processor that is separate from its operating system and is responsible for storing and protecting data in a secure environment. In this regard, Intel and Enigma's goal is to create ""production-level software that can be used at scale.""  The collaboration is a timely one, given that high-stakes attacks have already taken place. The most prominent of these is perhaps the DAO hack in 2016, where 3.6 million ether, valued at around $50 million at the time, was stolen from the decentralized and autonomous venture capital fund as a result of vulnerabilities in a smart contract.  In an April Medium post, Enigma CEO Guy Zyskind highlighted the need for secret contracts given the issues affecting other forms of privacy tech. These include problems with coin-mixing and zero-knowledge proofs, the latter of which he said are particularly vulnerable in multi-party cases where several ""untrusted and pseudonymous"" parties are executing computations.  Therefore, Zyskind said, secret contracts provide the ""missing piece"" by executing computations using encrypted data that stays hidden from network nodes.  Looking further ahead, Enigma will also be launching its testnet and mainnet – a fully functioning, live network– in Q1 and Q2 of 2018, respectively, according to its roadmap.

On June 15, the SEC obtained an emergency court order – unsealed on June 18 – to freeze the assets of Dominic Lacroix, who the agency called ""a recidivist Quebec securities law violator"" over his previous attempt to launch a token sale, or initial coin offering (ICO) – one officials have declared a ""full-fledged cyber scam.""  Last December, Lacroix, the project's other co-founder Sabrina Paradis-Royer, and their firm PlexCorp, were sued for securities fraud and had their assets frozen in a similar emergency order.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, PlexCorp was believed to have raised $15 million from thousands of investors through the ICO, of which the SEC said $810,000 was deposited with payment processor Stripe. However, an unknown amount was thought to remain in cryptocurrency wallets controlled by the firm.  According to an SEC litigation release dated Wednesday, the latest request for an asset order – filed at a federal court in New York City – alleges that Lacroix has been tapping into those funds since the previous freeze.  The agency said:  ""Lacroix had been using secret accounts, including an account in his brother's name but which he controlled, to improperly dissipate for personal use digital assets obtained from investors during the PlexCoin Initial Coin Offering.""  Aside from the SEC's 2017 actions against the project and its founders, a Canadian court ordered a two-month jail sentence against Lacroix and $100,000 in fines against his company for contempt of court.  In today's release, the SEC said it is also seeking an officer-and-director bar for Lacroix and a bar from offering digital securities against both Lacroix and Paradis-Royer.

When a customer signs a digital contract for property leasing or sales, the system will initiate a transaction on the blockchain that encodes the user's digital signature to obtain a timestamp. The hash of that blockchain transaction will be further stored in the contract system for future proof of the event.  The company said that, while its existing centralized contract management system is well equipped to prevent alteration of contract content using multi-signature technology, a remaining challenge is to ensure the authenticity of the exact moment of the agreement being inked.  Provide precision over when the contract is signed relative to when the actual money is paid is a factor that can make a notable difference should a dispute arise around a real-estate sale, it says.  Initially founded in 2001, Lianjia was rebranded as an internet-based brokerage firm in 2010, with an online-to-offline model. It has grown into one of the largest real-estate platforms in China and offers property leasing and sales services in over 20 cities in the country.

42380893,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92XWV,1529499602,Tether Review Claims Crypto Asset Fully Backed – But There's a Catch,"Nearly six months after parting ways with its auditor, Tether has finally produced a third-party report proclaiming that its cryptocurrency is fully backed by U.S. dollars – with some big caveats.  The state of Tether's reserves has been the subject of controversy for months, with online critics claiming the company has been issuing more tokens than it had dollars in the bank – printing money, essentially. Tether has consistently denied this, but has not produced conclusive evidence that it is reserved 1-for-1.  The matter has broad implications for the crypto markets, well beyond the holders of the so-called stablecoin, known as USDT, whose market cap stood at $2.6 billion on Wednesday.  For starters, many have alleged that Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange that shares common owners and managers with Tether, uses USDT to artificially drive up the price of bitcoin. An academic paper released last week supported this view, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission reportedly subpoenaed Bitfinex and Tether in December.  Also, USDT, which despite the lingering doubts generally trades around $1, has functioned as a substitute for U.S. dollars. Traders use it to quickly move money between crypto exchanges rather than using bank wire transfers, which can be slow and hard to come by.  Given USDT's importance to the ecosystem, then, an independent confirmation that the coin is in fact fully collateralized might be welcome news, undermining the manipulation claims and bolstering market confidence.  But the three-page memorandum released Wednesday is probably not going to settle the debate, given its ample disclaimers and limited scope.  First off, the report is not an audit. It was prepared by a law firm – Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan, LLP (FSS) – not an accounting firm.  That's not for lack of trying, according to Stu Hoegner, Tether's general counsel.  ""The bottom line is that an audit cannot be obtained,"" Hoegner told CoinDesk, claiming that this problem is not unique to his company but one faced by the entire cryptocurrency industry.  He went on:  ""The barriers to getting audited are simply too big to overcome right now, and not just for us.""  Those barriers include a steep learning curve for auditors in an emerging industry; accounting standards that predated the advent of cryptocurrency, creating uncertainty about how the rules apply; and the resulting need for auditors to exercise judgment, which is ""anathema to a lot of large accounting firms. As a CPA, I understand that,"" Hoegner said.  In this situation, he said, ""we've gone for next best thing.""  Although FSS used different procedures than an auditor would, Hoegner said, he argued that the ""key conclusions are similar to what an audit would generate"" – a snapshot of bank balances at a point in time.  But that highlights another issue with the FSS report: it covers only one such point in time, June 1.  On that date, the law firm said, it is ""confident"" Tether had more money in the bank than tokens in circulation (specifically, $2.55 billion of U.S. dollar reserves, held at two separate institutions, to cover $2.54 billion USDT). But the report says nothing about the level of collateralization on any date before or since.  In other words, it doesn't purport to show that USDT has been consistently secured over time – or that it is fully backed today.  The big guns  FSS, the Washington, D.C., law firm that Tether hired to assess its reserves and write the report, has no shortage of gravitas. It was founded by three former federal judges, one of them a former director of the FBI, Louis Freeh.  Another of the firm's partners, retired Judge Eugene R. Sullivan, is on the advisory board of one of Tether's banks, and was introduced to the company through that connection, according to the report. His ties to the bank also helped FSS do the review ""in a timely and comprehensive manner, ensuring that no pertinent information was overlooked,"" the report says.  To prevent any gaming of the process, FSS chose the date for which it would confirm its client's balances at the two banks ""without prior notice to or consultation with Tether,"" the report goes on. The law firm got sworn and notarized statements of the balances from the bankers.  Likewise, FSS didn't tell Tether the account balances it had received from the bank for June 1 when it asked the company for sworn statements certifying the amount of USDT outstanding on that date. (Those statements matched the number given by Tether's website.) The law firm also said it conducted in-person and phone interviews with senior personnel at Tether and the banks and reviewed hundreds of pages of documents.  Yet the report is rife with qualifications such as this one:  ""FSS procedures performed are not for the purpose of providing assurance.""  The law firm stressed that its confirmations should not be mistaken for an audit and were not conducted following generally accepted auditing or accounting standards. And it ""makes no representation regarding the sufficiency of the information provided to FSS,"" noting that it all came from Tether and its bankers.  And as noted above, even assuming that information was correct, it was only one day's balances.  ""FSS has not performed any procedures or made any conclusions for activity prior to or subsequent to June 1st, 2018, Close of Business,"" the firm says in its report.  A call to the number on FSS' website was not returned by deadline. But Hoegner said the law firm had ""unfettered access"" to Tether's bank balances beginning in March, even though the report only addresses the balances of one day.  Whether such a limited snapshot changes any minds is ""for the market to determine,"" he said.  Erstwhile auditors  Stepping back, it's important to remember that before it engaged FSS, Tether previously worked with an audit firm, Friedman LLP.  That firm produced an interim report in September 2017 that found the company had $442.9 million of cash as of Sept. 15 to fully back the USDT tokens. However, like the new report from FSS, Friedman's memo was extensively hedged. For example, it said the account where the cash is held is in the name of a trustee, and that it could not vouch that Tether had any enforceable agreement with the trustee.  Friedman was supposed to produce a full audit, but Tether said in January that its relationship with the firm had ""dissolved,"" without specifying which side broke it off.  Hoegner would not discuss the severing of ties with Friedman. However, he said Tether hasn't given up on the audit process. ""We continue to be in discussions with a number of professionals and firms about what can be offered and when,"" he said.  Indeed, a law firm's report is unlikely to carry as much weight as an audit firm's would, and not only because of the obvious difference in skill sets.  That's because, at least under U.S. law, audit firms also are generally accountable not only to their clients but to third parties whose decisions rely on their integrity.  ""Auditors tend to be broadly liable more frequently than attorneys do with the reports they issue,"" said Michael K. Shaub, an accounting professor at the Mays Business School at Texas A&M University.  Tom Selling, a CPA and former academic fellow in the chief accountant's office at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that auditors ""have specific standards for independence they have to adhere to,"" whereas when lawyers say they are conducting ""independent"" investigations for companies, ""nobody knows what that means.""  Put differently, ""99 percent of the work a law firm does is advocacy for the client,"" whereas ""100 percent of the work of an accounting firm is to hold themselves out as independent,"" Selling said.

42380899,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92XbX,1529496033,Brazil's Central Bank Plans Blockchain Data Exchange for Regulators,"Brazil could soon have a new blockchain platform to ensure the authenticity of information exchanged between the country's financial authorities.  Brazil's central bank, Banco Central do Brasil (BCB), announced Tuesday that it has built the platform in order to allow secure data sharing between itself and other domestic financial regulators, such as the country's Superintendency of Private Insurance (SUSEP), the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) and National Superintendency of Complementary Pensions (PREVIC).  In its release, BCB credits blockchain technology for its ability to provide a horizontal network of information, as well as immutable data storage.  The platform, dubbed ""Pier,"" will be used to exchange data associated with the authorization processes of financial institutions, including punitive processes, administrator performance and the management of corporate entities regulated by the central bank.  By integrating blockchain technology, Pier is said to eliminate the hierarchical nature of traditional business models and assist regulators in bypassing centralized entities when communicating. Furthermore, it would help prevent third parties tampering with the information, as the platform stores every data request using cryptographic signatures, the release says.  Despite having previously likened bitcoin to a pyramid scheme, Banco Central do Brasil has been enthusiastically experimenting with blockchain in the last year.  The central bank told CoinDesk in November 2017 that it was restarting work with the latest iteration of R3's Corda distributed ledger platform, having halted development because the older technology had been considered too ""immature.""  While it is not clear from the data provided which blockchain Pier is based on, the BCB said in the November interview that it was also developing proofs-of-concept on four platforms – ethereum, JPMorgan's Quorum and Hyperledger Fabric, alongside Corda.

42380904,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92Xj5,1529490627,Bitcoin Price Steady Above $6K Despite Bithumb Hack,"Bitcoin (BTC) suffered a minor dip last night after it was revealed that hackers had again breached a major cryptocurrency exchange, but the charts still favor a corrective rally to $7,000.  The cryptocurrency fell from $6,740 to $6,560 after Bithumb – the sixth largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by trading volume – confirmed that the attack had happened between late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning local time, adding that about $31 million-worth of cryptocurrencies had been stolen.  The Seoul-based cryptocurrency exchange has now halted all deposit and withdrawal service in order to ensure security and announced that it would fully compensate customers.  While the hack highlights the security risks that have plagued the cryptocurrency space and has potential to dent investor sentiment, bitcoin is so far refusing to embrace the negative narrative.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,630 on Bitfinex – down just 1 percent in the last 24 hours and holding well above the Asian session low of $6,560.  BTC's resilience has ensured the technical charts are retaining short-term bullish bias, and is trading above the support of the 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 4-hour chart, currently at $6,545.  4-hour chart  The chart shows a rounding bottom – a bullish reversal pattern – meaning sentiment has gradually shifted from bearish to bullish over the last 10 days. The relative strength index (RSI) is also holding above 50.00 (in bullish territory).  BTC also recently witnessed a bullish Bollinger Band breakout, as discussed yesterday.  So, the short-term outlook remains positive and only a break below the ascending trendline (dotted yellow line) would weaken the bull case.  Daily chart  As seen above, the bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day MA further indicates a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  View  BTC remains on the hunt for $7,024 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $9,990 to $6,108).  A daily close (as per UTC) above that level would open the doors to $7,500–$7,600, although the rally could be short-lived as the long-run technicals are still biased to the bears.  A break below $6,510 (rising trendline support, as seen in the 4-hour chart) would abort the short-term bullish view.  A daily close below $6,000 would likely revive the bear market and could yield a drop toward $5,000.

42380885,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92XNh,1529485820,Bithumb $31 Million Crypto Exchange Hack: What We Know (And Don't),"On Wednesday, roughly 35 billion Korean won (around $31 million) in cryptocurrency was stolen by hackers from the South Korea-based exchange Bithumb.  Although the breach may not be as severe as the $530 million hack of the Coincheck exchange earlier this year, the fact that Bithumb now ranks as the sixth biggest trading venue in the world still marks it as a notable, and worrying, incident.  While more details about the heist have surfaced in the hours following the event's confirmation, providing a glimpse into Bithumb's internal operations, some important questions about the hack still remain unanswered.  Here's what we know about the hack so far, and some details we still don't.  What we know  XRP compromised  While Bithumb has not yet disclosed full details of the stolen coins, news emerged following the hack that XRP, the native token of the XRP ledger and the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, has been targeted, according to a report from CoinDesk Korea.  Based on data from CoinMarketCap, Bithumb accounted for 10 percent of the global trading volume of XRP over the last 24 hours, with a total of $32 million-worth changing hands.  Bithumb has so far not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.  IT improvement failed  While Bithumb officially confirmed the breach early Wednesday morning local time, it appears that security issues were already drawing attention from the exchange at least several days ago.  According to a follow-up report from CoinDesk Korea, Bithumb conducted a security enhancement checkup on June 16, just days before the confirmed hack.  The exchange explained at the time:  ""Recently, the number of unauthorized access attempts has increased. As such, an urgent server checkup was conducted to strengthen the security of all system.""  At the same time, Bithumb also started moving users' assets to a cold wallet to store cryptocurrencies in a more secure offline environment.  The CoinDesk Korea report indicated that the hack comes at a time when Bithumb is spending 10 billion won, or around $9 million dollars annually on security measures. Another report from Yonhap further suggests that Bithumb beefed up its security measures by implementing so-called ""5.5.7 regulations"" last month.  Under this requirement, at least 5 percent of a financial institution's staff should be IT specialists. Among those, 5 percent should focus on information security, while at least 7 percent of the firm's total budget should be on information security.  The report from Yonhap stated that 21 percent of Bithumb's employees are technology specialists as of May, and 10 percent of those are responsible for information security. Further, about eight percent of the annual spending budget is used for data protection activities.  Although Bithumb appears to have fulfilled the 5.5.7 requirements, the report said the fact that it has 300 employees means it may not be able to cope with the increasing amount of trading volume and user numbers on its platform.  Government weighs in  An hour before Bithumb confirmed the hack on its website and official Twitter account, the exchange reported the case to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), a government organization that supervises internet and cybersecurity issues in the country.  An official from KISA said a dedicated analysis team is currently in the process of investigation the hack. As of press time, the agency has not yet disclosed any details from its investigation so far.  Bithumb to refund users  Immediately after announcing the hack, Bithumb confirmed it will pay back victims using its own reserves.  Industry experts later weighed in, including bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem, who praised the move despite the unwelcome incident.  ""Bithumb hacked for $30 million but covering all losses. Out industry is getting better and stronger,"" he tweeted.  In addition, litecoin creator Charlie Lee also commented that he believes the smart move is to ""keep on exchange coins that you are actively trading. It's best to withdraw right after trading.""  This is not the first time that Bithumb was reportedly hacked. As previously reported by CoinDesk, the platform was compromised last year with as many as 30,000 users impacted.  At that time, Bithumb later announced that it would repay each victim with 100,000 Korean won each, an amount worth about $85.  Bitcoin price dips by $200  According to data from CoinDesk, the price of bitcoin dropped by nearly $200 to a daily low so far of $6,561 an hour after Bithumb initially published the statement. As of press time, the price had bounced back to $6,640.  In addition, as Bithumb has so far only suspended asset deposits and withdrawals, trading activity on the exchange actually appears to be increasing since the news broke. Based on data from CoinMarketCap, 24-hour trading volume was initially seen at around $350 million at the time of the news and later climbed to $380 million around noon local time on Wednesday.  As of press time, Bithumb still remains the sixth largest platform globally.  What we don't know  Extent of the breach  It appears that XRP is one of the assets stolen in the hack, yet it's still unclear at the moment if other assets have been taken and in what quantities. In addition, it's also not clear the number of users on Bithumb that have been impacted.  In its announcement, Bithumb refrained disclosing these details, adding that it may disclose the hacked tokens today. It has not made any statement on that at press time.  Further, it's not publicly known at this time which wallet addresses the hacked cryptocurrencies have been sent to, or whether any have been liquidated or not.  Currently, there are over 37 cryptocurrency assets on Bithumb that are available for trading against the Korean won. Among them, EOS and TRON together account for over half of the total trading volume on Bithumb, at 31 and 22 percent, respectively.  Cause of the breach  At this stage, Bithumb has not officially announced what exactly allowed the hackers to access its system, nor has it provided an estimated timeline for when asset deposits and withdrawals will resume.  Currently, the cybersecurity division of South Korea's National Police Agency has sent seven investigators to Bithumb's office in Seoul to conduct interviews and inspect servers, according to a report from Yonhap.  However, the news agency cited anonymous sources from the industry that malicious emails had been sent to Bithumb users earlier this month. This possibly led to the hack, as hackers would be able to obtain account information if users clicked on links inside the phishing email.  It remains to be seen whether more details on the cause will be forthcoming as the investigations by the firm and the authorities continue.  Regulatory situation  Bithumb's hack marks the second cyber incident in the crypto industry in South Korea in recent days, and its second in less than a year. Less than two weeks ago, a breach at Coinrail is thought to have seen $40 million-worth of cryptocurrencies stolen. While, last year, a hack of the Youbit exchange notably led to the exchange filing for bankruptcy.  Apart from requiring domestic exchanges to enforce a real-name verification process, financial watchdogs in South Korea have not yet made any concrete move in regards to regulating exchanges in a legal framework.  It remains to be seen whether the Financial Services Commission will take a similar stance to its counterpart in the neighboring Japan.  Following the notable hack of Mt. Gox in 2014, which was the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time, regulators in Japan moved to launch a legal framework in 2017 that would allow the authorities to issue licenses to qualifying exchanges.

42380886,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92XOx,1529481614,EOS Locked 7 Accounts and This Has Implications for Everyone in Crypto,"In an effort to stop several thefts, seven accounts on the EOS blockchain were frozen on June 17.  At face value, many will see this move by the 21 block producers (BPs) in charge of validating transactions on the newly live blockchain as a success in stopping malicious actors from bilking several users out of more than $20,000 in EOS. But others are concerned that such a decision will have far-reaching implications – and not just for EOS, but many other blockchains as well.  But first, it's helpful to understand what happened last weekend.  As the migration from the ethereum blockchain to EOS's own blockchain took place, EOS holders had to register their new EOS wallet addresses. In the mayhem during the transition, some users were duped by fraudsters into handing over their private keys.  Within the cryptocurrency space, that typically means a user's crypto is gone forever, in the case of the EOS blockchain migration, the fraudsters weren't able to immediately sell the tokens and run off with them. Within the EOS rules, all but 10 of users' EOS tokens were staked when the blockchain went live. To withdraw tokens, users had to unstake their coins, which would then start a 72-hour waiting process.  While many EOS holders reported fraud, only seven disputed accounts had moved to unstake, the first step toward selling. Their cases were among the many before the EOSIO Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF), which is supposed to rule on disputes between users. But ECAF didn't rule, arguing that it didn't yet have jurisdiction.  So less than 24 hours before the stolen tokens were available to be sold, the BPs acted (unanimously), freezing those accounts until ECAF could make a valid ruling, in order to protect those who rightfully purchased tokens during the nearly year-long initial coin offering (ICO) the blockchain's creator, Block.one, executed.  While the BPs move to prevent theft appears defensible, still, some are speaking out against the decision.  The argument revolves around the fact that the rules governing the EOS blockchain – what stakeholders are calling its ""constitution"" – haven't been decided on and made official yet.  And even setting aside the larger legal questions about such a document's legitimacy before a court, BPs are currently left in this authoritarian grey area until the constitution is ratified by users.  As such, those on EOS are debating whether the proper course of action was taken, and those off EOS are convinced this shows that EOS' delegated proof-of-stake mechanism – which was used to create a faster, more scalable blockchain – is prone to centralized control and, in turn, potential censorship.  Like a military in a weak nation-state, the action illustrated the fact that BPs have the real power over EOS with or without a governance process.  As Dean Eigenmann put it in a Medium post:  ""The entire model of EOS seems like an oligarchy veiled in a democracy that can be easily corrupted through various means.""  And others went so far as to claim the systems' rules are a bad idea either way since it could eventually endanger other blockchains.  The claims  Backing up, when Block.one released the code for the EOS blockchain, the EOS tokens on the ethereum blockchain were locked up in a smart contract – gone forever.  Naturally, this confused some users, and where confusion and crypto meet, the opportunities to steal assets abound.  While most of the world's EOS holders were just watching and waiting to see if EOS would ever manifest as a public blockchain, a small subset of holders were panicking over the fact that one website or another had tricked them into losing control of their tokens on EOS.  A few user groups then put together a site called EOS911 to help those that had been duped.  The theory was that if a user could prove they controlled the private key that had held the EOS when it resided on ethereum, then that proved they should own the EOS on the new public blockchain, or mainnet.  While more accounts then these seven have been identified as being hacked by phishing websites and other malicious actors, the other accounts private keys haven't yet moved to unstake the tokens they controlled, and as such, those accounts have not been frozen.  And while many see this move as in line with EOS's mission to be a more user-friendly blockchain, some question whether or not solving a few people's immediate problems creates a long-term threat to EOS and even other blockchains.  The decision  As such, even EOS BPs aren't necessarily in agreement with the steps taken.  While the decision was unanimous, EOS New York, one of the top BPs explained that it supported the temporary freeze reluctantly.  The group called on the EOSIO Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF), a group put in charge of handling disputes on the blockchain once the constitution is ratified, to make a full ruling by June 19 or they would reneg their support of the freeze, releasing the tokens to be withdrawn. Late on June 18, ECAF issued a statement affirming the emergency ruling, so EOS New York continues to support the freeze.  Still, in a statement from EOS New York, the group said it would not support such an extraordinary action again short of a threat to the full protocol.  It concluded:  ""We are encountering these problems on a daily basis and we do not have the tools in place to properly address them.""  Most BPs have remained publicly silent of the decision, however.  While the group that will arbitrate disputes, ECAF, already exists, according to interim ECAF administrator Moti Tabulo, the arbitrators had no jurisdiction, explaining that ""this was due to a lack of mechanisms on the blockchain that ensure that EOS users agree to the EOS Constitution and binding arbitration.""  Still, EOS Tribe, a standby BP (not one of the 21 validating BPs but a party that could eventually, and wants to be, one of those) voiced its support for the freeze on Medium.  ""Some were hesitant to take any actions to avoid any risks or liabilities to themselves,"" Steve Floyd wrote on behalf of the group. ""... If we were elected we would not hesitate to take right actions to protect token holders' accounts and go through great lengths to convince other BPs.""  EOS Amsterdam, another standby block producer, voiced similar support.  Not everyone agreed though. Going by the name of Kev, one of the co-founders of EOS Go, the group that has been sharing information about the protocol, wrote a reply to EOS Amsterdam's statement on his organization's forum:  ""What stands out about this case, is it's the first time we've had a group with the power to act unilaterally, which they went ahead and did. ECAF said 'we don't have the power to act' and BPs said 'well we do, so we're going to.'""  And this signals perhaps an important aspect of the EOS system – that ECAF will have power when and if the community grants it power, but the BPs will have power as long as EOS exists, whether there are rules or not.  The downward spiral  For many crypto enthusiasts this control could be off-putting since the centralized power structures are generally shunned, but Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell and himself a consensus protocol designer, said that might be the least of everyone's worries.  He told CoinDesk, ""The fact that EOS transactions are subject to 'arbitration' based on an unclear document of zero legal force means that EOS transactions lack finality.""  Continuing, Sirer said, if BPs can roll back misbegotten tokens to their original holders then that creates a dangerous situation for everyone in crypto.  Imagine an attacker manages to steal one EOS from a legitimate user, and that attacker immediately moves it onto an exchange and trades it for some bitcoin. Then the attacker withdraws that bitcoin from the exchange. Later, EOS discovers the theft, the aggrieved holder proves their case and EOS rolls back the trade. Now the exchange is out both one EOS and part of a bitcoin.  So either the exchange eats that loss or it imposes it on the innocent user who had previously owned the partial bitcoin because the attacker is gone.  Now imagine the attacker stole not one EOS token but thousands, and imagine that after the attacker traded many more times, EOS BPs rolled back the transaction. The exchange, or whoever was deemed liable, would then be out significant amounts of money.  This is why it's apt for Sirer to describe the mechanism as a potential ""contagion,"" as he did in a recent tweet thread.  Expanding upon that statement, Sirer told CoinDesk:  ""The root cause of the problem is that all cryptocurrencies except EOS are bearer instruments with degree settlement periods, and EOS looks like a cryptocurrency. But it is not a bearer instrument, and it has infinite settlement time.  In this recent instance, there's no such danger because ill-gotten EOS never left the genesis block wallets, but in the future EOS enthusiasts envision, where millions of transactions are running across EOS every hour, the token holders and/or the BPs might not catch these thefts so quickly. Or even beyond that, arbitration might take much too long.  As such, Sirer concluded, ""Exchanges have been taken in by EOS's crypto-API and treat it as equivalent to others. They will get a wake-up call when the governance model kicks in and reverts transactions.""

42380896,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92Xe3,1529474427,Nasdaq Blockchain Trial Resolves Margin Calls 'in Minutes',"A group of industry stakeholders has developed a blockchain platform to transfer collateral to central counterparties when trading securities.  Stock exchange operator Nasdaq announced Tuesday that its clearing arm, along with securities services provider ABN AMRO Clearing and financial services firms EuroCCP and Euroclear, have developed a joint proof-of-concept (PoC) blockchain platform.  The aim, according to a press release, is to cover margin calls – a need to deposit funds or securities to cover potential losses – through a distributed network among collateral givers, takers and intermediaries,  According to the announcement, Nasdaq developed the PoC for the distributed network, while ABN AMRO Clearing and EuroCCP created a front-end interface and managed integration into the services.  Further, Euroclear, one of the world's largest settlement houses, processed the underlying collateral transfers, ensuring the settlement was final and monitoring regulatory compliance.  The current collateral processing has been challenged by several market changes like extended trading hours and the need to centrally clear derivatives traded over the counter under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the release said.  Due to an increasing amount of buy-side market players, such as money managers at hedge funds and institutional firms who want to clear their derivatives trades, the need to provide an efficient securities collateral solution has become essential. In particular, these firms need to cover margin calls despite operating in different time zones.  The innovative development using the PoC would allow market participants ""to handle the margin call, the securities collateral delivery and the return process within minutes.""

The exchange has not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.  As of press time, Bithumb still is seeing over $300 million in 24-hour trading volume on its platform, making it currently the sixth largest exchange in the world, data from CoinMarketCap shows.  The hack marks the second incident in less than two weeks in South Korea. As previously reported by CoinDesk, Coinrail, a smaller cryptocurrency exchange in the country also revealed that it was hacked on June 10.

42380887,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92XQD,1529453117,$800 Million: ICON's Token Swap to Take Place Within 24 Hours,"The countdown has begun for smart contracts protocol ICON's June 20 token swap.  On Wednesday, investors will swap their existing ethereum-based ICX tokens, used for project fundraising, for coins on a live version of ICON, effectively exchanging all existing tokens in an elaborate code migration. Launched in 2017, ICON aims to connect independent blockchain communities, each with their own governance proposals, to a governing blockchain based on a protocol called loopchain.  ICON sold 50 percent of its ICX token supply for the idea in a sale last September, raising 150,000 ETH worth around $42,750,000. The project launched its blockchain in January this year, and according to CoinMarketCap, it has a collective market capitalization of about $800 million.  Still, investors have yet to be issued ICX tokens.  As such, ICON's swap will be implemented at an exchange rate of 1:1 (1 ethereum ICX token for 1 mainnet ICX coin) via the ICONex wallet from June to September 25, as well as through supporting exchanges. Users will have until Wednesday to transfer their tokens to Binance and Upbit, and until Thursday for Bithumb - the only three exchanges supporting the swap, according to ICON.  In the event that, instead of using the ICONex wallet, token holders wish to have an exchange carry out the migration process, ICON has advised users to have approximately 0.002 ETH in their ICX-ethereum wallet in order to pay for the transaction.  Once ethereum tokens are swapped for ICX coins, the fundraising tokens will be burnt, with those that don't make the swap being locked once the swap period ends. This is to prevent further use of the tokens. (ICON has not yet indicated how token holders can track the progress of the swap.)  But if tomorrow will mark the live version of the long-awaited platform, it hasn't all been smooth sailing in the run-up to the swap. For example, there has been some confusion within the community as to when the token migration was set to occur.  Unlike other projects, such as EOS, ICON opted to conduct its token swap after its mainnet launch. The project said at the time of the launch that it planned to delay the swap, projected for March in the project's roadmap, until after it released its native wallet.  However, by early April, the project had yet to announce the date of the swap, and later apologized for what it called a ""lack of communication leading to confusion throughout the community,"" in an update on its Medium page.  Additionally, the project encountered some technical difficulties.  On June 16, a bug was discovered in ICON's smart contract, allowing any user except the smart contract creator to disable token transfers. Although developers resolved the issue the same day, that didn't stop users from faulting the project for its coding oversight in this instance.  Like other projects, ICON has also expressed concerns over potential scams. Yesterday, the ICON Foundation warned users of those who could be impersonating the project during the swap, such as actors requesting ICX to be sent to individual wallets rather than the ICONex wallet and supporting exchanges.  In addition to releasing its mainnet and preparing for the token swap, ICON recently announced partnerships with the Deloitte Startup Advisory Group and social media platform Line Plus, adding to their list of enterprise partners which include Samsung, Wanchain, Hyundai and Aion.
