42380086,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M4ov,1512773145,Zcash Sets Roadmap for Blockchain Upgrades in 2018,"The zcash development team is planning a series of network upgrades for next year, according to a roadmap published today.  Writing on the zcash blog, co-founder Zooko Wilcox and CTO Nathan Wilcox detailed two milestone upgrades – ""Overwinter"" and ""Sapling"" – the latter of which was discussed in a roadmap update earlier this year. According to the post, the goal of next year's upgrades is to ""further upgrade zcash's performance, security, and usability.""  The first update, Overwinter, is scheduled to go live in June 2018. Per the post, that upgrade is focused on ""making itself and future network upgrades safer for users, even in the case of governance contention."" Though light on detail at present, the Wilcoxes said that future details about the update would be released in a future blog post.  The second one, set to take place in September, is centered around its ""Sapling"" protocol, which is aimed at boosting the capability of the cryptocurrency's privacy-oriented shielded transactions.  The two wrote:  ""Sapling will activate the Sapling protocol update, bringing orders of magnitude improvements in both time and memory to shielded transactions, making mobile wallet support feasible. Additionally, Sapling will rely on the Powers of Tau open-participation parameter setup, largely mitigating concerns about the parameter setup risks for zkSNARK applications (including other applications outside of Zcash).""  The post concludes by suggesting that other upgrades may be in the offing, including functionality for smart contracts and research into the proof-of-stake algorithm.  ""Possibilities include scalability improvements to allow practically unlimited numbers of transactions, novel consensus algorithms such as Proof-of-Stake, and private and scalable smart contracts,"" they wrote.

Bitcoin Cash Price Is Up, But Gains May Be Short-Lived","Bitcoin cash (BCH) is well bid today, but a close look at the numbers indicates the positive move could be deceptive.  Prices dropped for the third straight day yesterday, signaling a transient victory for the bears in the ongoing tug of war with the bulls.  Looking like it would head lower towards $850 (Nov. 17 low) earlier today, bitcoin cash instead regained the bid tone and rallied as high as $1,550 before trimming gains. The world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market value was last seen trading in the $1,450 neighborhood, as per data provided by CoinMarketCap.  So, was yesterday's breakdown a ""bear trap,"" or is the positive price action seen today a case of ""bull trap""? Only a close today (as per UTC) above $1,545 (161.8 percent Fibonacci extension) would be bad news for the bears.  According to the price chart analysis, though, the odds of that happening are low.  Bitcoin cash chart  The above chart shows:  Bitcoin cash suffered a downside break of the rising channel (marked by blue channels) and a bearish symmetrical triangle breakdown yesterday.  The relative strength index (RSI) fell below 50.00 into bearish territory yesterday, possibly signaling more losses ahead.  BCH ran out of steam at $1,545 earlier today and fell back to $1,350 levels.  The decline from $1,545 to $1,350 also marks a failure to hold above the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA).  Further, the 5-day MA and 10-day MA are sloping downwards in favor of the bears.  Further, the market usually crowds out weak hands (bear or bull) following a major move in prices.  The observed bearish rising channel breakdown and a bearish symmetrical triangle breakdown both indicate a bullish-to-bearish trend change – i.e. the rally from the October lows below $300 may have topped out.  And the move higher seen today could have taken out the weak hands – i.e. bears with tight stops (and, hence, low-risk tolerance).  View  Chart analysis suggests bitcoin cash is more likely to break below $1,280 (rising channel support) in the next 24–48 hours and confirm that today's spike was a bull trap. Prices could then test support at $850 (Nov. 17 low) in the short-run.  On the higher side, only a close (as per UTC) above $1,545 would revive the bull run.

42380087,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M4qB,1512741636,Microlending Startups Look to Blockchain for Loans,"A new of wave startups believe blockchain can help microfinance deliver on lofty promises.  Billed as a silver bullet that could lift the poor out of poverty since the mid-2000s, microfinance, or the use of small loans to boost the unbanked, has failed to take off for various reasons – namely, a lack of transparency and the existence of middlemen that blockchain is said to eliminate.  ""The problem with microfinance is not that it's a bad model. The problem with microfinance is that the people who put money into microfinance are completely invisible to the people who get the microfinance, and vice versa,"" said Ashish Gadnis, CEO of BanQu, a startup seeking to build an economic identity platform on top of the ethereum blockchain.  But while blockchain's transparency and ability to reduce middlemen have been extensively detailed, Gadnis said it was the tech's ability to help people achieve economic sovereignty when traditional financial institutions still won't bank them that led to his light-bulb moment.  During a volunteer stint in East Africa, for example, Gadnis discovered that a farmer who had received numerous microloans was still turned away by banks, even though he owned land and had made money from his most recent harvest.  Rather than putting her on the path to ""financial inclusion"" – the microloans seemingly had made worse off by trapping her in a vicious debt repayment cycle.  Gadnis explained:  ""She had three different loans from three different microfinance institutions (MFIs), but she was not 'bankable' because she was operating at anywhere between 15 percent to 40 percent interest rates on each loan.""  Echoing Gadnis' sentiment on the issue, Deloitte argued in a recent paper that the notion that simply making more credit available to poor people offers a solution to poverty must be broadened and rethought.  Direct to developing  And according to blockchain proponents, the technology's ability to connect people directly to each other without middlemen is the first step in rethinking microfinance.  Taynaah Reis, co-founder of peer-to-peer remittance and lending platform Moeda, began looking to blockchain because of this feature earlier this year.  Reis explained that her inspiration for the project – which won first place in a United Nations-sponsored hackathon – was that one-third of the 200 million citizens in her native Brazil that have minimal access to banking services and are forced to take out credit lines with annual interest as high as 4,000 percent.  Her company partners with local credit cooperatives that have existing relationships with customers in rural areas, but aren’t always able to extend services at affordable rates, if at all.  ""It’s not that [cooperatives] don’t want to serve these people, it's just that it's unprofitable for them to do so,"" explained Brad Chun, CTO of Moeda, arguing that blockchain allows for easier auditability and more operational efficiencies that ultimately translate to a lower cost of lending than traditional service providers using centralized databases are able to offer.  While Moeda vets and decides which projects can be featured on the site to receive loans, once those projects are reviewed, lenders can send money directly to the recipients.  In September, the company processed a $50,000 pilot loan to a cooperative farm in rural Brazil, making it possibly the first-ever such investment denominated in a cryptocurrency (the project's own Moeda tokens).  Lending identity  Blockchain has also been touted as a way to fix identity on the web, another area where microfinance has struggled, but Moeda and others are looking to iterate on.  Scott Nelson, CEO of Sweetbridge, a platform over which users can lend money to themselves against existing assets via smart contracts, argued that blockchain's unique advantage in this setting is the ability to use existing affinity networks to help build and verify borrower identities.  He said:  ""The principles behind the blockchain can be leveraged to extend trust networks that are already existent in the culture and allow those trust networks to extend credit directly.""  Such blockchain-based digital identities, proponents believe. will allow borrowers to build their own economic histories and credit profiles, even if they are invisible to the legacy banking system.  ""Identity is really the core of what the Moeda system is. We're not just providing financial services, we're providing an identity that is linked to everything that a person is doing,"" said Chun, adding:  ""It's not your traditional credit score, it's what your reputation to your community is.""  BanQu has rolled out a similar system in five countries. Its ""economic passport"" aggregates a variety of data points (financial history, land records, trust networks, business registrations) so those seeking loans can more readily demonstrate their qualifications to potential lenders.  ""So now, if I wanted to lend as a microfinance institution ... I actually know who the farmer is, what land it is, how much they're producing, so I don't need four middlemen,"" explained Gadnis. ""So as a microfinance institution, I can reduce the cost of borrowing.""  Long road ahead?  While such innovations may carry significant promise, the path to widespread adoption is littered with roadblocks.  For one, these projects will require buy-in from not only consumers but governments and traditional financial institutions during a time when global banks are de-risking.  Plus, Andi Dervishi, global head of the Fintech Investment Group at the International Finance Corporation, said getting consumers up to speed on how to securely use such new technologies will likely be an uphill battle.  ""We have instances in Africa where people handwrite their PIN numbers on the debit card,"" he said at a recent event hosted by the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C. ""If we think of cryptos in the context of (financial) inclusion, we're adding a layer of complexity rather than taking it away.""  Harish Natarajan, a finance specialist at the World Bank, echoed that sentiment, saying ""the jury is still out"" regarding blockchain's eventual usefulness in improving financial access.  Natarajan concluded:  ""At this moment, it seems to be more like a niche product used in certain contexts and in certain settings.""

42380078,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M4hN,1512738012,Bitcoin Dips Below $15k on Weak Afternoon Trading,"The price of bitcoin is off to a slow start on Friday.  As measured by CoinDesk data, bitcoin's near 6 percent drop in the last six hours places the cryptocurrency among the worst performers in the day's afternoon session (6:00 to 12:00 UTC). During the window, bitcoin fell briefly below $15,000, in a move that took it off a torrid pace that had seen it rise to a new all-time high above $17,000 on Thursday.  At press time, the value of its network is just over $250 billion.  Still, it seems action moved elsewhere in the market, with lesser-known alternative cryptos TRON, EOS, Waltoncoin and Veritsaseum all seeing more than 10 percent gains during the six-hour span.  It's notable, however, that the data also suggests choppy activity in the markets today.  The day's morning trading session (0:00 to 6:00 UTC), for example, saw an entirely different set of cryptocurrencies emerge as the top performers among the 60 largest coins.  After taking an early lead on the day as the session's top performers, populous, bitcoin cash and Ripple's XRP token, all fell back during the afternoon session, data shows.  On a 24-hour span, the charts look different as well, with bitcoin up nearly 2 percent on the day, and IOTA emerging as the best-performing cryptocurrency with a more than 20 percent gain.

42380096,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M50F,1512734404,Correction Coming? Bitcoin Retreats After $17k High,"Bitcoin prices are suffering this morning, following a record spike to over $17,000 overnight.  As per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the cryptocurrency looked set to revisit the new high of $17,364 hit yesterday at 16:29 UTC, but ran out of steam at $17,153.94 at 1:59 UTC.  Since then, however, bitcoin has taken a sharp downturn and was last trading at $14,794 levels at time of writing – a drop of close to $2,500 since yesterday's high.  BTC has appreciated close to 150 percent over the last five weeks on speculation that a move to the mainstream via an entrance to the futures contracts market would increase demand for the cryptocurrency. That's even though the institutional money would be chasing the synthetic derivatives that seldom impact the underlying asset (bitcoin).  Further, as CoinDesk reported, the world's largest investment banks believe the financial system is ill-prepared for the launch of bitcoin futures and have called for a postponement of the listings.  Currently, it looks like the markets may be heeding the warning. Having shown signs of exhaustion near record highs earlier today, the sell-off is picking up pace and BTC is now down over 12 percent for the session, as per the BPI.  The price chart analysis also indicates that the odds of a technical correction have increased over the last 24 hours.  Bitcoin chart  On the above chart:  The 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are curled upwards in favor of the bulls.  The rising trend line (red) is seen offering support around $10,000 levels.  The stochastic has turned lower from the overbought territory.  The relative strength index (RSI) has formed a top, but is yet to cut 70.00 levels from above (i.e. turn lower from the overbought region).  As noted yesterday, historical data show bitcoin price suffers a notable technical pullback only on confirmation of a bearish price-RSI divergence and/or if the RSI and stochastic move lower from the overbought territory.  There is no evidence yet of a bearish price-RSI divergence, but the stochastic has moved lower from the overbought territory (marked by circles). A correction could gather pace once the RSI also breaks below 70.00 levels.  1-hour chart  The above chart shows:  Rounding top pattern – formed at the end of an extended upward trend and indicates a reversal in the long-term price movement. A break below $15,142 (rounding top neckline) would open the doors for a move to $12,500 levels.  The rounding top adds credence to the overbought conditions shown by the daily RSI and stochastic.  View  BTC could suffer a pullback to sub-$10,000 levels.  The upward sloping nature of the 10-day MA indicates the dips below $10,000 could be short-lived, however.  On the higher side, $18,261 and $18,399 are key resistance levels.

42380083,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M4jt,1512727208,Bitcoin Prices Spark Demand for Washington's Cheap Electricity,"The Central Washington region of the U.S. is reporting surging demand from bitcoin miners for its cheap hydroelectric power.  With the cryptocurrency's recent price gains, bitcoin mining has become more attractive, according to John Stoll, managing director of customer utilities at Chelan Public Utility District (PUD).  As reported by OPB Newshttps://www.opb.org/news/article/bitcoin-virtual-currencies-mining-northwest-electricty-strain/, higher numbers of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs are now requesting the lowest possible electricity rates in parts of the state, including Grant County, Chelan County and Washington public utility districts. Cheap electricity is required by bitcoin miners to power their power-hungry specialized computer processors in order to make an enterprise profitable.  Stoll told the PUD board of commissioners earlier this week that his department had received more than 20 ""serious"" calls in the last two weeks. ""Our challenge is capacity,"" he said at the time.  He explained:  ""We're using up our freeboard in our system as we see load growth, whether it be cryptocurrency or even what we're seeing with tourism, housing, apartments and things of that nature.""  OPB News said power utility firms in Washington state and neighboring mid-Columbia are now concerned that the growth in electricity demand could ultimately pose a risk to their systems or bring added costs to general consumers.  Ryan Holterhoff, public affairs officer for Grant County PUD, said that the utility has outstanding requests for approximately 500 megawatts, saying it was ""about an 85 percent increase over our current average load.""  While the PUD is accepting inquiries, delays are likely, he added.  Just one month ago, bitcoin was trading for around $7,500. The cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high last night, passing $17,000, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

42411662,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gldBJU,1512723637,The Blockchain Token Velocity Problem,"Kyle Samani  is the co-founder and managing partner of Multicoin Capital, a new thesis-driven crypto fund that invests with a multi-year time horizon in blockchain tokens.      Basically, all token pitches include a line that goes something like this: ""There is a fixed supply of tokens. As demand for the token increases, so must the price.""  This logic fails to take into account the velocity problem.  In this post, I’ll explain the velocity problem by providing an in-depth example. Then I’ll examine mechanisms that reduce velocity.  A high-velocity example  Ticket fraud (literally reprinting and selling a ticket multiple times) for events is a huge problem.  There's a reasonable case to be made that tickets for live events should be issued on blockchains. If venues come to accept blockchain-issued tickets, this solution should stomp out all fraud. You can't double spend blockchain-based assets.  Issuing tickets on blockchains can bring other benefits, including disallowing resale, profit sharing on resale back to the venue, capping resale amounts, etc. Ticketing on-chain should create a lot of value for venues, artists and consumers: it eliminates fraud, reduces scalping, and reduces fees to middlemen like Ticketmaster and StubHub.  Although I love this use case for blockchains, there is no reason that I, as a full-time crypto investor (speculator), want to actually hold Aventus, Ticketchain or Blocktix tokens (all three are blockchain-based ticket issuance platforms). Even if these platforms become widely used and process tens of billions of dollars of transactions, their underlying token mechanics are not structured so that the price of the underlying token will materially appreciate.  Consider a hypothetical platform that we'll call Karn, in honor of the show that never ends.  Consumers want to pay for tickets denominated in dollars. They may purchase Karn tokens as part of the ticket acquisition process, but they won't hold the tokens for more than a few minutes at a time. There's simply no incentive to hold them and incur price risk relative to the dollar.  Venues also don't have an incentive to hold Karn tokens because they, too, want to avoid price risk. After consumers trade their tokens for concert tickets, venue hosts will trade Karn tokens for their preferred currency. Note that this cycle can be completed in seconds by leveraging decentralized exchanges such as 0x.  No one actually wants to hold Karn tokens. The presence of a proprietary token actually creates a worse UX for consumers by introducing an unnecessary layer of friction into the ticket purchasing process. The moment anyone receives Karn tokens, they exchange them for something else – either a ticket (consumer) or dollars (venue).  Even if Karn becomes the global standard for ticket issuance, no one will want to hold it. BTC/ETH/USD-denominated trading volume for Karn tokens may skyrocket as the platform becomes the global ticketing standard, but the price will grow sub-linearly relative to transaction throughput.  The primary stakeholder group who will profit from the rise in trading volume of Karn tokens will be market makers who provide liquidity for those entering and exiting the market. This is not a bad thing. As asset pairs increase in volume and become highly liquid, bid-ask spreads collapse to near 0 percent, which is good for consumers and venue hosts.  To be clear, in this scenario the venue hosts still win by cutting out scalpers, and consumers win because of increased fraud protection. But despite delivering real, tangible benefits to marketplace participants, our fictional Karn token won't actually capture the value the protocol is creating.  Quantifying velocity  Here’s where velocity comes in. I define it as follows:  Velocity = Total Transaction Volume / Average Network Value  Therefore:  Average Network Value = Total Transaction Volume / Velocity  Velocity can be measured over any time span, but is normally measured annually. Trading volume can be difficult to measure. This not only includes trading volume that occurs on exchanges, but over-the-counter trades and actual usage of the platform.  We can say that an asset has a velocity of 0 if, over the course of a year, no one buys or sells it. The lack of liquidity would cause the asset to trade at a discount to its ""intrinsic"" value. Assets need some velocity to achieve their full intrinsic value. The difference is known as the liquidity premium.  In the case of a proprietary payment token that nobody wants to hold, velocity will grow linearly with transaction volume. Per the second equation above, transaction volume could grow a million-fold and network value could remain constant. Almost all utility tokens suffer from this problem.  Reducing velocity  There are a few ways a protocol can reduce the velocity of its associated asset.  1) Introduce a profit-share (or buy-and-burn) mechanism:For example, the Augur ($REP) network pays REP holders for performing work for the network. REP tokens are like taxi medallions: you must pay for the right to work for the network. Specifically, REP holders must report event outcomes to resolve prediction markets. A profit-share mechanism reduces token velocity because as the market price of an asset decreases, its yield increases. If the yield becomes too high, market participants seeking yield will buy and hold the asset, increasing price and reducing velocity.  Also, a cash-flow stream makes a token easier to value using a traditional discounted cash-flow (DCF) model.  2) Build staking functions into the protocol that lock up the asset: This includes proof-of-stake mechanisms for achieving network-layer consensus. However there are far more compelling reasons to stake than simply to achieve node consensus. For example, FunFair is a platform that powers online casinos. FunFair only supports one-against-one games such that the player is playing the house directly (therefore no poker). The house must maintain reserves to pay out highly unlikely events, such as a user winning big in slots or winning 10 times in a row in blackjack. The casino operators will need to lock up far more than 50 percent of all tokens.  3) Balanced burn-and-mint mechanics: Factom is the best, and perhaps only, example.  A number of protocols have implemented the burn concept (without minting), notably FunFair. I am highly skeptical of currencies that are explicitly deflationary to create upwards price pressure on the value of the token. In the long run, deflationary currencies will create weird incentives for holders, causing unnecessary volatility due to excessive speculation. Burn-and-mint addresses this problem.  In Factom, the cost of using the protocol is denominated in U.S. dollars at $.001. Each use is $.001, regardless of the price of FCT. Users burn tokens to use the protocol as designed. Independently, the protocol mints 73,000 new tokens each month and distributes them to validators (Factom is its own chain, not an ERC20 token). If users don't burn 73,000 tokens in a month, supply increases, which should exert downwards price pressure. Conversely, if users burn more than 73,000 tokens per month, supply decreases, exerting upward price pressure. In the long run, there should be linear relationship between the usage of protocol and price.  The burn-and-mint dynamic is possible because Factom is its own chain. ERC20 tokens do not have network validators who can be compensated via inflation. Burn-and-mint is possible for ERC20 tokens, albeit trickier. There's not a generic, obvious set of network participants who should receive the tokens that are generated by inflation. Also, more technically: inflation is tricky to implement because smart contracts cannot run as daemons that auto-inflate; they must be triggered.  4) Gamification to encourage holding: Let's revisit ticketing. Since many concerts sell out quickly, venues could prioritize customers based on having held X tokens for Y days. If enough venues adopt this mechanic, velocity will fall.  Another example: YouNow is rolling out a proprietary in-app cryptocurrency called PROPS that allows users to tip content creators during live video broadcasts. YouNow also has a ""discover"" tab. The YouNow service is more likely to rank a creator's content highly if they hold tokens. This creates an interesting dynamic in which content creators are paid in PROPS, but need to convert to fiat to pay the bills. On the other hand, they want to hoard tokens to become more discoverable, fueling more attention and generating more tip-based income.  5) Become a store of value: This is by far the most difficult to achieve as it's not a function of a specific design mechanic, but rather a question of broader technical viability and market acceptance. If people genuinely come to believe in a token as a store of value, there will be a significant probability that they're willing to hold onto excess tokens rather than sell them for something else.  One reason to hold an asset is an expectation that it will increase in price. In theory, this should dampen velocity and drive up the price of the asset. This basically defines bitcoin today. Bitcoin's value is a function of a speculative value game, not from intrinsic utility as a payment system.  Another reason to hold an asset is the expectation that its value will be stable. A number of stablecoin projects such as Maker and Basecoin are trying to create trustless assets that are price-stable on the open market.  Becoming a general-purpose store of value is extremely difficult. There are only a handful of projects even attempting to fulfill this vision today. It's not clear how dominant the long-run winner will be. You can make perfectly rational arguments for a handful of currencies with 20–30 percent of global value each, a 75-5-5-5-5-5 percent split, or an 80-20 percent split. Although money has a strong network effects, it's not clear how strong those effects are, or how much the market will demand viable competition to mitigate macro-level risk associated with a single mega currency.  Takeaways  Velocity is one of the key levers that will influence long-term, non-speculative value.  Most utility tokens don't provide a compelling reason for token holders to hold the token for more than a few seconds. Absent speculation, assets with high velocity will struggle to maintain long-term price appreciation.  Hence, protocol designers will be well served to incorporate mechanisms into their protocols that encourage holding, not just usage.

42380090,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M4nf,1512709255,The Threat of Bitcoin Futures,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and corporate finance, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.      The financial press has been in a flutter over the launch of bitcoin futures trading on not one but two reputable, regulated and liquid exchanges: CME and CBOE.  CME Group  , the largest derivatives exchange in the world, as well as one of the oldest, will launch bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 18th, while CBOE Global Markets, which owns the Chicago Board Options Exchange (the largest U.S. options exchange) and BATS Global Markets, plans to beat CME to the punch by opening its own trading on Dec. 10th.  In theory, this opens the doors to institutional and retail investors who want exposure to bitcoin but for some reason (internal rules, or an aversion to risky and complex exchanges and wallets) can’t trade actual bitcoin.  And that expected flood of interest is, from what I hear, part of the reason that bitcoin’s price recently shot past $11,000 (which, considering it started the year at $1,000, is phenomenal).  But if that's true, I’m missing something: I don’t understand why the market thinks there will be a huge demand for bitcoin itself as a result.  A primer  First, a brief overview on how futures work: Let's say that I think that the price of XYZ which is currently trading at $50, will go up to $100 in two months.  Someone offers me the chance to commit to paying $80 for XYZ in two months' time. I accept, which means that I’ve just ""bought"" a futures contract. If I'm right, I’ll be paying $80 for something that's worth $100. If I'm wrong, and the price is lower, then I’ll be paying more than it's worth in the market, and I will not be happy.  Alternatively, if I think that XYZ is going to go down in price, I can ""sell"" a futures contract: I commit to delivering an XYZ in two months’ time for a set price, say $80. When the contract is up, I buy an XYZ at the market price, and deliver it to the contract holder in return for the promised amount.  If I'm right and the market price is lower than $80, I've made a profit.  Beyond this basic premise, there are all sorts of hybrid strategies that involve holding the underlying asset and hedging: for instance, I hold XYZ and sell a futures contract (I commit to selling) at a higher price.  If the price goes up, I make money on the underlying asset but lose on the futures contract, and if it goes down the situation is reversed. Another common strategy involves simultaneously buying and selling futures contracts to ""lock in"" a price.  Futures contracts currently exist for a vast range of commodities and financial instruments, with different terms and conditions.  It's a complex field that moves a lot of money. The futures market for gold is almost 10x the size (measuring the underlying asset of the contracts) of the physical gold market.  How can this be? How can you have more futures contracts for gold than actual gold? Because you don’t have to deliver a bar of gold when the contract matures. Many futures contracts settle on a ""cash"" basis – instead of physical delivery for the sale, the buyer receives the difference between the futures price (= the agreed-upon price) and the spot (= market) price.  If the aforementioned XYZ contract were on a cash settlement basis and the market price was $100 at the end of two months (as I had predicted), instead of an XYZ, I would receive $20 (the difference between the $100 market price and the $80 that I committed to pay).  Both the CME and the CBOE futures settle in cash, not in actual bitcoin. Just imagine the legal and logistical hassle if two reputable and regulated exchanges had to set up custodial wallets, with all the security that would entail.  So, it’s likely that the bitcoin futures market will end up being even larger than the actual bitcoin market.  Side effects  That's important. Why? Because institutional investors will like that. Size and liquidity make fund managers feel less stressed than usual.  The bitcoin market seems to be excited at all the institutional money that will come pouring into bitcoin as a result of futures trading. That's the part I don’t understand.  It’s true that the possibility of getting exposure to this mysterious asset that is producing outstanding returns on a regulated and liquid exchange will no doubt entice serious money to take a bitcoin punt. Many funds that are by charter prohibited from dealing in “alternative assets” on unregulated exchanges will now be able to participate.  And the opportunity to leverage positions (get even more exposure than the money you’re putting in would normally warrant) to magnify the already outrageous returns will almost certainly attract funds that need the extra edge.  But here’s the thing: the money will not be pouring into the bitcoin market. It will be buying synthetic derivatives that don’t directly impact bitcoin at all.  For every $100 million (or whatever) that SupermegahedgefundX puts into bitcoin futures, no extra money goes into bitcoin itself. These futures do not require ownership of actual bitcoins, not even on contract maturity.  Sure, many will argue that more funds will be interested in holding actual bitcoins now that they can hedge those positions.  If SupermegahedgefundX can offset any potential losses with futures trading, then maybe it will be more willing to buy bitcoin – although why it would allow its potential gains to be reduced with the same futures trade is beyond me. And, why hold the bitcoin when you can get similar profits with less initial outlay just by trading the synthetic derivatives?  That's the part that most worries me. Why buy bitcoin when you can go long a futures contract? Or a combination of futures contracts that either exaggerates your potential gains or limits your potential loss?  In other words, I’m concerned that institutional investors that would have purchased bitcoin for its potential gains will now just head to the futures market. Cleaner, cheaper, safer and more regulated.  Look out  What worries me even more is the possibility that the institutional funds that have already bought bitcoin (and pushed the price up to current levels) will decide that the official futures market is safer. And they will sell.  Now, it’s possible that the demand for bitcoin futures and the general optimism that seems prevalent in the sector will push up futures prices (in other words, there will be more demand for contracts that commit to buying bitcoin at $20,000 in a year’s time than those that commit to buying at $12,000 – I know, but the market is strange).  This will most likely influence the actual market price (""Hey, the futures market knows something we don’t, right?"").  And the launch of liquid futures exchanges increases the likelihood of a bitcoin ETF being approved by the SEC in the near future. That would bring a lot of money into an already crowded space.  But… it’s also possible that the institutional investors that are negative on bitcoin’s prospects (and there’s no shortage of those) may use the futures markets to put money behind their conviction. It’s much easier to sell a futures contract with a lower-than-market price than it is to actually short bitcoin. These investors may well send signals to the actual bitcoin market that sends prices tumbling.  And the leverage inherent in futures contracts, especially those that settle for cash, could increase the volatility in a downturn.  That’s pretty scary.  Let’s not even go into the paradigm shift that this development implies. The growth of a bitcoin futures market positions it even more as a commodity than a currency (in the US, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates futures markets). And even more as an investment asset than a technology that has the potential to change the plumbing of finance.  So, while the market appears to be greeting the launch of not one but two bitcoin futures exchanges in the next two weeks (with two more potentially important ones on the near horizon) with ebullience, we really should be regarding this development as the end of the beginning.  And the beginning of a new path.

42428246,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6f3h,1512702118,Report: Bitcoin Derivatives Banned By South Korean Government,"Regulators in South Korea have reportedly banned the trade of futures contracts and other derivatives tied to bitcoin.  According to a Dec. 6 report from the Korea Herald, directives from the country's Financial Services Commission led securities firms such as eBest Investment & Securities and Shinhan Financial Investment to cancel seminars marketed towards bitcoin futures investors. Those seminars were reportedly set to take place early next week.  Investments in derivatives developed by foreign exchanges are also banned, the newspaper further said Wednesday.  The reported ban comes less than two weeks after the Financial Supervisory Services's chief, Choe Heung-sik, said the regulator would not be regulating bitcoin trades, noting that the nation considers bitcoin as a speculative product rather than a currency or payment method.  It's also a notable development given the move by some exchanges in the U.S. to develop such products, including CME Group and CBOE. CBOE is expected to begin trading its bitcoin future on Sunday, with CME moving to officially tee off their own the week after.  CME chairman emeritus Leo Melamed previously argued launching futures contracts could help regulate bitcoin’s price, though some quarters of the industry have strongly pushed back against the concept.  In an open letter addressed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and published yesterday, the FIA industry trade group expressed its members' concerns over the pending launches, as well as the process that led to their approval.  ""A public discussion should have been had on whether a separate guarantee fund for this product was appropriate or whether exchanges put additional capital in front of the clearing member guarantee fund,"" wrote Walt Lukken, the group's chief executive.
