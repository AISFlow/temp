Pechin, a partner of the defunct crypto investments manager Valour Invest, which Brazilian media described as a pyramid scheme, was arrested in August 2019 on suspicion he paid hitmen R$500,000 to kill Rocha.

In a press statement, the Court said prosecutors allege Pechin owed Rocha R$2.5 million “due to the sale of bitcoins” at the time of Rocha’s death. They cited that debt as the motive for Rocha’s murder.  A lower court had previously rejected Pechin’s request for freedom after finding “strong evidence” he participated in the Rocha murder.

42404908,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8QmT,1596662046,China's Open Source Development Has Lessons for the US,"The news cycle is obsessed with a global technology competition between China and the United States. Whether we look at artificial intelligence, 5G, blockchain or the Internet of Things, these next generation platforms are supposed to be the battleground between the world’s latest economies. The fighting is getting unfair. We can look at India and its band of over 50 Chinese apps, including the super app WeChat, or we can analyze the Donald Trump treatment of TikTok, put up for a fire sale and justified with jingoistic rhetoric.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    However, competition in the next century is going to be far more complex than intellectual property ownership. It is going to be waged over multinational open-source networks, reintegrating finances and economies into a digital global superstructure. We have to develop clearer ways of thinking about this competition, and in this entry we will discuss one such framework. But first, why is there such extreme positioning over technology assets by both China and the U.S.? The simple answer is pain, and the economic havoc wrought by the coronovirus epidemic on the world.      See also: Lex Sokolin - DeFi Protocols Should Act More Like Fiduciaries      The West has had the worst quarter in recent economic history – down 10% both in the U.S. and the eurozone. I've written before how the shock of opening up to capitalism in the USSR led to a 45% GDP collapse over half a decade, resulting in life expectancy decreasing by 10 years for the average Russian due to alcoholism and violence. We aren't going to see something of that scale in the U.S., but we will see continued social unrest, deep racial tension and restructuring. Perhaps this is productive stress. More likely, it is a pressure cooker with a hefty price.      China is holding up a bit better in the coronovirus environment, based on stronger national control over people, technology and narrative. The country's second quarter saw 3.2% relative GDP growth (though arguably the first-quarter collapse was sharper in China than elsewhere). China has expanded control over Hong Kong, and made big investments into artificial intelligence and blockchain, which the West continues to view in a generally negative light. Chinese fintech giant Ant Financial is planning a $30 billion initial public offering (in Hong Kong) at a $200 billion valuation.      And now these tensions come together in a farcical way around TikTok.      Most people see TikTok as a way for teens to socialize and negotiate popularity. It creates memes and celebrities through algorithmic recommendations. This isn’t Amazon or Well Fargo, by comparison.      To Donald Trump and the American national security apparatus, it’s a Trojan horse pulling private data and various functional information from a global user base of 1.5 billion people (80 million in the U.S.) into the machine learning maw of the Chinese Communist Party. It is hard to parse the claims around TikTok in a substantive way because we’re dealing with privileged intelligence. But I will note the following:    TikTok was big in Asia before an American competitor was purchased by it and re-branded for $1B: Bytedance, the developer, closed the popular Musical.ly video app it acquired for nearly $1 billion in December and will move users to a revamped version of its homegrown competitor TikTok.  Theories, including conspiracies, are rampant: There's a whole subreddit of people trying to reverse-engineer TikTok and making claims about its data practices, including storing the contents of someone's mobile clipboard.  The Chinese state may have a reason to scrub content outside of trying to spy on the U.S.: TikTok – Yes, TikTok – Is the Latest Window Into China’s Police State; Expat Uyghurs are gaming the social platform known for fluff to find loopholes in Xinjiang’s information lockdown.  TikTok is practically kicked out of the U.S., needing to hand over American operations to an American company, with Microsoft in the lead.:White House puts Chinese apps on notice as Trump gives TikTok ‘45 days’ to reach Microsoft deal.    The middle road would suggest TikTok is indeed more aggressive in gathering user data for processing than the other social networks, but that it may have business or compliance reasons to do so.      The American social networks are also keen to over-gather data, but they do so under a business model context they inherited out of the rise of the internet. Further, the current economic pressure from the virus is likely yielding unsavory jingoism and performative short-term punishment to distract from the presidential election in a historically stressful year.      With those issues out of the way, the interesting bit that remains is intellectual property and open source competition. This is the common complaint about Chinese business – that patents and copyrights are not respected and used for that nation's betterment. If only they did not ""steal"" Western technology, they would not be so far ahead, goes the argument. I don't quite buy it.    Competition in the next century is going to be far more complex than intellectual property ownership. It is going to be waged over multinational open-source networks.    In particular, I don't quite buy it because of what is happening on Ethereum and public blockchains. You might have noticed that ETH and BTC had both strongly appreciated over the last week. There are many narratives floating around as to why this happened, but the most straightforward one is the rise of decentralized finance, with its $4 billion in collateralized lending. Another narrative would be the technical upgrade of Ethereum 2.0, which is meant to start going live shortly. Forgive me for talking about price. But in this case, it appears to be a nice proxy for adoption.      How was this technology able to grow, pulling in billions in financial assets and millions of users, without any protection on intellectual property at all? All of this is open-source software, which you can download, audit, copy (i.e., fork) and redeploy. It is a technology that has been under study in China for nearly five years and remains open, competitive and becomes only stronger when integrated into the Chinese Business Services Network.    The framework    Let’s establish a framework that creates a clear distinction between (1) a defensible network effect that accrues from operating a market, or a value chain of industry players, and (2) the maturity level of the technology itself. In the past, you would sequence the creation of the idea, building it from scratch, and then blitz-scaling it in a linear fashion. If it took a long time to create an idea, you would want legal protections that allowed you to then build it and profit from it. If somebody copied your idea immediately, it would appear that the time spent on research and development was essentially stolen. Thus, recourse to the law.      I often reread this article describing the Shenzhen manufacturing hub as ""open-source manufacturing."" It articulates how Shenzhen rose to become a global leader in hardware, with Chinese firms building gadgets off Kickstarter before the original campaigns had even finished. Housing the factories that made branded Western goods, the Eastern generics had the same quality and came from the same assembly lines. The ideation phase of the entrepreneurial journey was skipped by copying, and resources were focused on lighting-fast execution.      In addition to having the manufacturing speed and engineering talent to actually build the goods, the firms also had another advantage. That advantage was a storefront on Alibaba, and a supply chain that powered a similar storefront on the Amazon marketplace. Thus, not only could something be made quickly, it could be sold on a platform with a built-in audience. It is this second part of the equation that most exacerbates the intellectual property complaint. If the entrepreneur had locked in its audience through brand affinity, the generics would not meaningfully matter.      But decentralized finance protocols, social media networks and marketplaces like Amazon and Alibaba demonstrate another principle. Even before you launch any particular product, you may be able to establish your niche and create a pre-commercial footprint, like a large, engaged following. Or, it could be your approved store profile on Amazon, or the inside track with the Apple iOS mobile application approval team, or an existing set of trading partners in institutional finance.      Take a moment to read this thread from the founder of the Synthetix protocol, a DeFi tool that allows people to create derivatives. It is an explanation of how to grow from $100 million to $500 million by engaging the community with economic participation.      Within the boundary of our framework, you start first by building out community participation through token distribution. People pay for the expectation of the delivery of the product and are aligned for the longer term. Then, you implement DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) governance, which drives engagement and allows the community to fix mistakes. The combination of the two recursively lands you into the upper right quadrant of a scalable software with a defensible market network.      Of course, this can go entirely wrong. The community might plunder a project instead of supporting it, like a management team paying itself bonuses in a leveraged buyout. There might be low participation and a lack of direction if an insufficient number of people are engaged. But at the very least we have a strategy.      This is similar to what incumbents do with their existing customer footprints. When rolling out new products, Facebook, Amazon, JPMorgan and the rest already have millions of people aligned with a brand tied to a commercial relationship. Launching a new product to this audience is orders of magnitude cheaper than acquiring users from scratch. And similarly, incumbents can capture innovation and ideation through corporate venture investments. This practically copies (or inexpensively acquires) product ideas for distribution.      See also: Lex Sokolin - Weed Out the Soviet-Era Ponzi Scheme Eating Ethereum      Finally, we can see where copying a product without having an existing commercial community doesn't have any positive effect. Take for example the forking of Bitcoin into Bitcoin Cash, or any other 50 or so clones of the coin. Or alternately, even the more contested forks like Ethereum Classic do not really compete for the dominant spot given the much smaller market presence.      When looking at prescription drug revenue, we can see that about 80% of it comes from brands and 20% from generics. This would be a fair assumption to carry over to our thought experiment about copying software.      Is it really worth it to posture about a global technology Cold War over 20% of the market? It is also possible that the 20% captured by the generics is a separate user niche entirely, with a different collection of preferences (e.g., more price sensitive), and therefore copying grows the overall pie.    So it goes    Let's find a poetic end to the discussion.      Decentralized lending aggregator Yearn.Finance (YFI) has seen somewhere between $200 million and $400 million in value flow through it over the last month after distributing a reward mechanism to its community. That's the model we sketched out above.      Within a week or so, the project was copied in China, launched as YFII, and allegedly attracted several hundred million in crypto assets from large Asian investors. This caused a number of Western projects, like Balancer, to freak out and hide YFII from their interfaces (i.e., censor it) even though the code continued to execute on permissionless global networks. As people dug in further and tried to engage with the Chinese DeFi community, they saw a large WeChat group that was being used as a governance mechanism for the cloned project.      Was it a scam? Was it gambling? Was it a speculative project? Does it hurt the economic share of Yearn.Finance? Or does it open up a new market for ideas and exchange? Should DeFi projects censor scams, or imitation, or theft?      I'd like to think there is a parallel world version of me, sitting in front of a screen on some late afternoon, agonizing over the human condition through the lens of fintech themes in another language. Maybe there is another *you* as well, reading that other text and wondering about your own twin in a strange culture.      What we twins have to agree on is that blockchain networks, open-source software, the Shenzhen manufacturing process, the Chinese blockchain services network, an increase in venture capital funding, and national software technology budgets have radically transformed the nature of competition. It’s not enough to have an idea and linearly bring it to the local market. We are playing on a different scale, with incentives and guidelines that look alien at first glance.

An architectural quirk in the most-used software version of Ethereum, Geth, has led to an uptick in the practice of spamming the network to secure trade profits over the last six months, according to Certus One co-founder Hendrik Hofstadt.      Transaction spamming is one of many reasons the average Ethereum user fee has increased some 800% since May, according to Coin Metrics. Ponzi schemes like MMM or DeFi’s general growth in 2020 are also to blame.      Read more: Weed Out the Soviet-Era Ponzi Scheme Eating Ethereum      Hofstadt told CoinDesk that algorithmic trading firms have created bot swarms to watch the Ethereum transaction queue (called the mempool). These bots wait for large trades on DeFi platforms such as Uniswap. After they go through, the bots quickly place orders to take advantage of price movements in what is called “backrunning.”      Too many firms knew about this practice, though. So some firms switched up their tactics over the spring months by sending a wall of executions to crowd out others and secure a backrun order.    Higher rewards for miners, higher profits for traders    Rough modeling shows some $5.99 million in gas fees have been used to execute this trading strategy since April 2018, according to developer Philippe Castonguay. That’s about a week’s worth of typical Ethereum fees for useless transactions.      Moreover, the majority of these trades occurred since March 12’s “Black Thursday,” when DeFi platforms saw record volumes.      Read more: Thursday’s Market Madness Strained Ethereum’s Killer App: DeFi      For trading firms, this translates into more fees overall but arbitrage profits into the hundreds of thousands, according to addresses provided by Hofstadt.      For the network, spamming crowds out other transactions. It also increases the average fee for everyone.      On July 29, the Geth team approved swapping the execution model to a first come, first served basis. Yet, it remains to be seen if mining firms will update to the new Geth version.      Hofstadt said miners could keep doing business as usual if they value the extra pocket change from DeFi traders more than helping out the network in general.      Indeed, total network fees per day on Ethereum has increased 1,077% since May 5 from $162,200 to $1,909,000 on a seven-day rolling basis, according to Coin Metrics.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/05/defi-traders-are-gaming-ethereum-for-higher-profits-researchers-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28dc05f5863ceef5783ff2f863e7d7f5661ce676-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42404907,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8QlU,1596655070,Two Reasons Crypto's Bull Market Is Coming,"Anil Lulla is the co-founder and COO of Delphi Digital, a research firm dedicated to advancing the development of the crypto market.      In the past few months at least four crypto hedge funds have shuttered. Yet, there's never been a better time for institutions to get involved in this sector.      Despite an unprecedented global pandemic wreaking havoc on just about every major economy on the planet, investors have made quite a lot of money in recent months in both traditional and crypto markets. When it comes to the latter, this is just the beginning for those with the discipline to seek out under-appreciated opportunities in this fast-paced industry.      The incoming bull market for crypto will look completely different than the last one. Mostly because there won’t be just one, but two different bull markets simultaneously playing out over the next 12-18 months.      See also: Bitcoin ‘Active Entities’ at Highest Since 2017 Bull Run      One will involve the rotation of capital from zombie projects to protocols where the underlying product is actually being used and accruing value. Even without an influx of new capital or users, there is still too much money tied up in ghost protocols, many of which dominate today’s large-cap names.      After the last bull market, we were left with many projects with no real usage other than speculation. They were focused more on marketing efforts than actual product development.      Take XRP, for example. It is the king of worthless altcoins due to its ability to accrue very little to no value, even if adoption skyrockets. Even after the mid-March carnage, it still held a total market value north of $6 billion and currently trades close to $13 billion. Stellar’s native asset (XLM) is still in the top 15 at nearly $2 billion. NEO, another celebrated project in the ICO bull run that has yet to deliver, has a market cap of $1 billion.      There’s an important difference between the adoption – or “success” – of a certain protocol and the potential for value to accrue to its native token. But as I’ve written before, the reallocation of capital away from zombie protocols has already begun.      The “crypto tourists” of the last bull market have been driven out by inactivity, while the initial coin offerings and token projects they threw money at are shuttering. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is outshining alts, and investors now demand properly designed systems that actually contribute to the broader crypto ecosystem.      The speed at which these projects innovate and adapt to new market conditions makes them extremely dynamic. They show the advantage of open source development versus more traditional top-down methods. Square may have an incredible team that’s been doing great work on all fronts (e.g., Cash App and Square Terminals). But even it can’t compete with the optionality of DeFi protocols. Now that DeFi base pieces have been laid, the sector is becoming more like an ecosystem than an industry with a bunch of different startup teams.      See also: DeFi Dad – Five Years In, DeFi Now Defines Ethereum      DeFi looks completely different today than even a few months ago. This time last year, there were only four DeFi projects in the top 100 crypto projects by market capitalization – Maker, 0x, Augur and Ren. Today, there are 11 with the addition of Aave, Synthetix, Compound, Kyber, Kava, Bancor and Loopring.      This time next year, I predict there will be at least 25 in the top 100. That's a lot of redistribution of capital even without an influx of new money coming in.      The second bull market will be led by the usual suspect, bitcoin. As policymakers around the world continue to provide pandemic-related economic relief, bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a hedge against fiat currency debasement only grows stronger. Circumstances are converging to accelerate us towards precisely the kind of world crypto was designed for.      In the short run, non-sovereign scarce assets (i.e. BTC and gold) could be challenged by increased deflationary pressures. But such conditions would undoubtedly force policymakers to provide even greater monetary relief, compounding our conviction in bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a hedge against fiat currency debasement.    We saw a consistent misallocation of capital, with firms following each other into rounds at untenable valuations.    When my partners and I left jobs in traditional finance to start a crypto research firm, we knew we were early, but we couldn’t help but sense something truly revolutionary was happening here: an era-defining opportunity on par with the advent of the internet. Two years later, after spending so much time closely tracking interesting protocols, that hunch has transformed into iron-clad conviction. This is exactly why our team is doubling down on our commitment to the industry.      Last week, we officially announced Delphi Ventures, a new division of our company that will focus on providing long-term financial and intellectual capital to the most promising projects in the space.      Broadly speaking, we saw a consistent misallocation of capital, with firms following each other into rounds at untenable valuations for pre-launch projects with no clear path to value-accrual and no justifiable use for those amounts of capital. On the other hand, our research led us to identify early stage projects with extremely promising ideas that we believed were being underfunded.      See also: Crypto Hedge Fund Neural Capital Closes After Losing Half Its Money      It’s easy in hindsight to say the investments made in the last period of market exuberance were doomed to failure, but there has been a shift in the standards of the industry.      The foundation for the base infrastructure of the decentralized economy is being laid as we speak. The composability between projects allow teams to iterate much faster than traditional software companies and opens up experimentation going forward.      My partner Medio Demarco said it best last year when tweeting that it was a bigger risk staying in traditional finance than getting involved in crypto.      Eventually, I expect high-profile tech investors like Chamath Palihapitiya and Mark Cuban, who have expressed interest in crypto in the past, to go deeper and become champions of the sector. As of this weekend, the top 100 DeFi projects had a market cap of ~$7.3 billion. The total crypto market cap is around $370 billion. It's crazy to think DeFi deserves less than 2% of this.      On that note, I wanted to share a secret with all of you. At the top of the 2017 bubble, a friend of mine gave me a shirt as a joke. It says ""moon: the moment when the crypto market cap reaches a total market cap of $1 trillion USD.""

42404905,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8QhY,1596653243,ETH Lite: Reflexer Labs Raises $1.7M to Build a Somewhat-Stable Coin for DeFi,"Call it a “gentlecoin,” perhaps?      A new decentralized finance (DeFi) project aimed at softening volatility has closed a $1.68 million seed round led by Paradigm, with participation from Standard Crypto, Compound founder Robert Leshner and Variant Fund, from a16z alum Jesse Walden.      Reflexer Labs is building a new asset called rai (RAI) that's meant to follow the price movements of ether (ETH) but more gradually.      ""I think RAI will be extremely useful for protocols. A form of collateral that will help users not get liquidated that much,"" Stefan Ionescu, the project's CEO, told CoinDesk in a phone call.      Or, as Paradigm partner Charlie Noyes, put it:    ""Self-correcting mechanisms are an elegant method of efficiently managing protocols. Reflexer is taking this approach to build the first trustless stable asset administered by algorithms rather than manual governance.""    RAI is generated much like its namesake, dai (DAI): Users stake an asset, ETH, to the system to borrow a new crypto asset.      But where DAI attempts to match the price of a U.S. dollar, RAI does not.      RAI targets a ""redemption rate"" relative to its underlying asset but stripping out much of the volatility (the precise proportion hasn't been specified). So, if over a three-month period, ETH generally trended up but with some stomach-churning drops along the way, RAI would just generally trend up, with maybe only some slight stumbles (this also means that RAI holders would miss hard upward spikes, too, as it calms all movements).      Read more: Five Years In, DeFi Now Defines Ethereum      ""The idea is the system has kind of an index inside it,"" explained Reflexer's Ionescu. ""It's a number called the redemption price. It's the ideal price for RAI at any time.""      Think of it this way: DeFi on Ethereum is a whitewater river with sections of Class 5 rapids for those who want them; Reflexer is the Army Corps of Engineers smoothing out a nice stretch that never breaks Class 3.    Steady now    The long view here is to give DeFi an asset for collateral that has both the qualities of price stability (if not full rigidity) and decentralization.      ETH has fared very well this year but it had one wild swing in March. While it took the ETH price six weeks to recover, the most acute pain was felt by those who had staked ETH to borrow DAI on MakerDAO. Over $8 million was lost in manipulated collateral liquidations. If RAI had been in the mix on Black Thursday (March 12), its backers say, it could have eased some of the pain.      Read more: Mempool Manipulation Enabled Theft of $8M in MakerDAO Collateral on Black Thursday: Report      RAI actually aims to bring a well-established technology from electrical and mechanical engineering into crypto. A proportional–integral–derivative controller is a well-worn, proven technology based on control theory that helps different systems maintain consistency.      ""One of the things that's exciting to us as investors in the project is this is the first time elements from control theory in engineering will be embedded in smart contracts,"" Alok Vasudev of Standard Crypto told CoinDesk in a phone call.      The specifics remain to be determined but Reflexer's product will use oracles to monitor the price of RAI and the price of ETH. If RAI doesn't match the target price, the system can fine-tune the amount of RAI it takes to pay back debt. This can expand and contract the supply as needed to return to the target.      Since this is a delayed reaction there will still be shifts in price but they should be more gradual, giving users time to adjust, whether they are using RAI in a loan or as collateral on a DeFi platform.    Building    The new seed round will enable Reflexer to begin modeling its ideas and determine the optimal mechanics before deploying a live system. While not committing to a launch date, Ionescu hopes that if all goes well it should appear in 2021.      SpankChain founder Ameen Soleimani is a co-founder of Reflexer Labs, Ionescu told CoinDesk, assisting with growth efforts on a part-time basis. In February, Soleimani released a concept called MetaCoin, for a governance-minimized stablecoin. He wrote at the time:    ""In light of MakerDAO's recent upgrade to Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD) and decision to abandon ETH as the sole form of collateral (thereby introducing counter-party risk for offchain assets), it's worth considering what a governance minimized, ETH-only system might look like.""    RAI has evolved from the initial idea of MetaCoin, but it meets some of the objectives detailed therein. In particular, that of eschewing the use of centralized cryptocurrencies like USDC as a collateral and limiting the powers of human governors.      Read more: MakerDAO Adds USDC as DeFi Collateral Following ‘Black Thursday’ Chaos      Ultimately Reflexer will need to deploy some kind of token, similar to MakerDAO's MKR, with limited control powers in order to fully decentralize, Ionescu said.

42404892,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8QWj,1596648973,17-Year-Old Pleads Not Guilty to Twitter Hack as Defense Tries to Lower Bail From $725K,"The 17-year-old claimed to be the mastermind behind July's Twitter hack pleaded not guilty to all charges brought against him by U.S. authorities.    Graham Ivan Clark has pleaded not guilty to all 30 counts against him by U.S. authorities at an appearance at Hillsborough County Courthouse, Florida, on Tuesday, the Tampa Bay Times reported.  State authorities have described Clark as the ringleader for a coordinated attack on 30 high-profile accounts, including CoinDesk's, that promised to double the money of users who sent cryptocurrency.  In a bail hearing Wednesday, Clark's attorney said the $725,000 bail posted Saturday was ""grossly inappropriate"" with the $117,000 believed to have been gained in July's hack.  The defense argued Florida law only requires monetary conditions for bail for those accused of dangerous crimes.  Clark was investigated last year by California authorities who confiscated 400 bitcoin and subsequently returned 300. The defense claims the return of the bitcoin legitimizes them but prosecutors allege the cryptocurrency was illegally acquired.  State prosecutors contested the defense's argument, claiming Clark poses a danger if he has access to an electronic device.  The defense said the court could ""fashion"" a bail in which Clark hands over $117,000, forfeited if convicted, and returned if not, as well as restrict his access to the internet and electronic devices.  Conducted over Zoom, public access to the call was abruptly restricted after a series of loud interruptions or ""zoom bombs.""  The ultimate outcome of the hearing is not yet known.

42404909,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8QnS,1596643521,"Blockchain Bites: Square's Revenue Surge, Eth 2's Final Testnet, c-Lightning's Latest Update","Square’s bitcoin business is booming, lawmakers are batting for crypto staking protocols and a blockchain-based voting system in Russia may have been hacked.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Bitcoin Revenues Square’s bitcoin business is booming. Announcing Tuesday, the San Francisco payments company said revenue made from selling bitcoin to Cash App customers during the second quarter came to a total of $875 million – up 600% year on year. Square stresses it only takes a ""small margin"" selling bitcoin to customers, but Q2's results show it made $17 million profit – an increase of 711% year-on-year. While bitcoin made up only 5% of Square’s revenue at $34 million in Q1 2018 (its first full quarter), it came to $65.5 million in the same quarter in 2019. Square Crypto, a subsidiary, has also sponsored Lightning developer Lloyd Fournier.      Taxing Staking Four congressional lawmakers wrote a letter to the Internal Revenue Service Wednesday, asking the U.S. tax agency to ensure holders of staked crypto don’t face tax liabilities for receiving block rewards before they sell their new tokens. “It is possible the taxation of 'staking' rewards as income may overstate taxpayers’ actual gains from participating in this new technology,” the letter said. “It could also result in a reporting and compliance nightmare, for taxpayers and the Service alike.” Each block could be treated as a taxable event, creating headaches for filers and the IRS alike. The lawmakers, chairmen of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, said staking rewards resemble both rental income and interest payments.      Sophisticated Engineering The teenager arrested for allegedly masterminding the recent Twitter hack gained access to the platform by “socially engineering” a Twitter employee, according to a government affidavit and the company’s internal investigation. Social engineering is a broad term that encompasses many methods of exploitation including bribery, coercion, phishing and SIM swaps. Haseeb Awan, CEO of Efani, which protects against SIM swap attacks, estimated around 1,000 people fall victim every day, and the exploits are getting more sophisticated. In many cases, perpetrators go uncaught, and victims frequently do not come forward, making the arrests in the Twitter hack the exception to the rule.      Blockchain Breached? Hackers are reportedly selling the personal data of more than a million Russians who voted electronically, using blockchain technology, during the recent constitutional amendment process. Over 1.1 million data points were stolen and put on sale for $1.50 each on the online forums, though authorities deny the hack. The online voting system, based on Bitfury’s open-source Exonum blockchain and built with the help of Kaspersky Lab, was previously reported to have poor data protection. Journalists were able to decrypt people’s votes as well as pull passport numbers out of a weakly-protected file posted online by the authorities, a Russian media outlet Meduza wrote.      DeFi Development The Chicago DeFi Alliance (CDA) is launching one of the first accelerator programs for decentralized finance (DeFi) startups beginning in August. The program is modeled on Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator program and will invest $120,000 in each participating team in exchange for future token purchases. Volt Capital co-founder Imran Khan and CDA partner Qiao Wang will lead the eight-week program for early-stage startups, plus a fast-track program to introduce more established startups to relevant experts. “DeFi has all the fundamental qualities to become a real, trusted alternative to the legacy financial system,” Wang said.

Genesis’ crypto lending rebounded in Q2.  Missouri man pleaded guilty to trying to buy chemical weapons with bitcoin.  At stake    In the mainstream financial press there is a lot of attention given to the inflationary risks of the Federal Reserve’s bout of money printing. As Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead said, the United States has printed more money in June than in its two centuries of existence. Putting this in context, over the course of the pandemic the Fed has nearly doubled its balance sheet to about $7 trillion.      Some pundits, such as professor of economics Antony Mueller, believe the reverse case – that the economy is deflating – is more likely in the short term. Deflation is when the rate of growth of demand is lower than the growth rate of production. An under-utilized workforce reduces not only productivity, but also demand: because there’s less money to spend.      It’s this same depressed workforce that is likely keeping inflation, or hyperinflation, in check, according to Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius.      “The modern monetary policy suffers from a deep fear of deflation and tries to avoid it at any cost,” Mueller said. “There are various effects at work that promote an automatic recovery from a deflationary shock.” He cited ZIRP and NIRP (zero interest rate policy and negative interest rate policies) and quantitative easing as two tools in the Fed’s toolbox.      These same tools often can often prevent a natural business correction and lead the economy to inflate. If that’s the case, and the workforce remains under lockdown, the states may be heading to a period of stagflation instead, where inflation rises without growth.      Ending on a pragmatic note, Mueller said reliable economic prognosis is difficult and expectations are volatile. There is a degree of trust in economists and government actors to make forward-directed decisions, and “while trust can easily be destroyed, it is hard to re-establish.”      Good thing there’s a trustless hedge.    Market intel    Sustained Cycle After wild Sunday action that saw the price of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency fall as low as $10,050 on spot exchanges like Coinbase, bitcoin is trading relatively flat, at around $11,200 Tuesday. “The asset is trading in a narrow range of $11,080 to $11,220,” said Constantine Kogan, a partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital. “To continue last week’s rally, bitcoin needs to overcome the resistance level, which is in the $11,300- $11,400 region,” he added.

42404894,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8Qbe,1596643249,Republic Cuts Through SEC Red Tape to Raise $16M via Security Token Sale,"Under a pair of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, crowd-equity platform Republic has raised $16 million through the sale of its Republic Note security token.      Announced Wednesday, the firm secured commitments of $11 million through a Regulation D offering. An additional $5 million from non-accredited investors was committed through a Regulation A+ offering that has yet to be approved.      ""What we did was a Reg D and a 'testing the waters' under Reg A+,"" Republic CEO Kendrick Nguyen explained in a phone call. ""We will hold [the non-accredited investors'] space until we can qualify the Reg A+ and close that step.""      The Republic Note token is secured on the Algorand blockchain and allows holders to receive dividends from Republic Core, a Republic subsidiary. Dividends will be earned through exits of companies that did their initial fundraising on Republic. According to the project's white paper, 800,000,000 Republic Notes have been minted.      Nguyen said that, of the chains that have features needed for security tokens such as anti-money laundering checks and white-listing investors, Algrorand “is truly faster, cheaper.”      Part of the crowd-equity sector that grew out of the JOBS Act of 2012, Republic has facilitated over $100 million in investments since 2019, allowing individual investors to join rounds alongside major venture capital firms.      Overall, more than 10,000 people sought to participate in Republic's latest token offering, the company said in a press release. Roughly 700,000 people have used the site to invest in projects.    Multiple offerings    Republic had announced a $12 million pre-sale of security tokens in 2018 with support from Binance and NEO. Ultimately, Republic broke these sales into four phases, as described in the Republic Note white paper.      In phases one and two, the company raised roughly $12.5 million. This current sale represents phases three and four.      Read more: Binance, NEO Lead $12 Million Investment In AngelList Crypto Spin-Off Republic      Algorand was a strategic investor in the prior phases of Republic's fundraising, along with Binance. Nguyen said that once Binance Chain is able to support security tokens, a wrapped version of the Republic Note for the Binance Chain will be created. It is meant to work much like wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) does on Ethereum, a one-for-one pairing.      When the Republic Note offering closes at the end of the presumed Reg A+ approval, the company will have raised roughly $28 million in token sales, Nguyen said. With additional sales of company equity, the firm will have raised approximately $40 million since inception.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/05/republic-cuts-through-sec-red-tape-to-raise-16m-via-security-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/569472947d71aa8aa863bd7cf6fc694fdbb65674-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a motion last month, Lynn Wright, the ex-wife of Craig Wright, claimed she had previously owned one-third of her former husband's firm, W&K Info Defense Research.  Ms. Wright claims her transferable interest in W&K moved into one of Wright's other companies in 2012, Craig Wright R&D, which ultimately changed its name to ""Tulip Trust,"" and that she only regained ownership interest again in July 2020.  The Tulip Trust is an entity claimed to hold the million bitcoin (around $12.6 billion at press time) at the heart of the dispute.  Disputing the filing's validity Tuesday, lawyers for the estate of David Kleiman, Craig Wright's late business partner, said Ms. Wright's testimony means Craig Wright's previous assertions that the Tulip Trust was a blind trust – an entity run independently of its beneficiaries – was not true.  ""[T]he infamous “Tulip Trust” is now apparently just a name change of a company affiliated with Dr. Wright, it is not a “blind trust” as previously alleged,"" Kleiman's lawyers said.    See also: 4 Experts Agree: Craig Wright’s Latest Cryptography Claims Are ‘Nonsense’    Kleiman's legal team asserts the inconsistencies in Ms. Wright's submission come from it apparently being intended to ""defraud"" both them and the court.  They also claim there is no proof Ms. Wright owned, relinquished or regained interest again in W&K.  Ms. Wright's motion asserted Ira Kleiman was not authorized to take his dead brother's position at W&K, thereby, she claims, invalidating the entire case.  Although Ms. Wright split from her husband in 2010, part of the divorce settlement, according to the motion, gave her half of the company; she also asserts the ""W"" in W&K refers to her, not her husband.  Tuesday's filing is part of an opposition to Craig Wright's push for a motion of summary judgment – a judgment without a full trial.  The Kleiman estate is suing Wright for half of the bitcoin in the trust, as well as intellectual property.

42404904,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8QkV,1596634511,Bitcoin Price Rises 3% as Gold Trades Above $2K for First Time,"Bitcoin is again acting like a macro asset, drawing bids amid a record rally in gold and a broad-based sell-off in the U.S. dollar.    At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $11,624.63, representing a 3% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  Gold is trading at a record high of $2,040 per ounce, having surpassed the $2,000 mark on Tuesday.  Investors are flocking to gold on sinking inflation-adjusted bond yields and a weaker U.S. dollar, as noted by macro analyst Holger Zschaepitz.  The U.S. 10-year bond, when adjusted for inflation, currently offers a yield of -1%.  The dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against majors, recently reached a 26-month low of 92.55, according to data source TradingView.  Gold and bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen strong inflows over the past five months on the growing demand for an ""alternative"" currency, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Bitcoin and gold have recently rallied in tandem with the dollar losing ground across the board.  As gold rose from $1,800 to $1,980 in the 11 days to July 28, bitcoin jumped from $9,100 to $12,100 and the U.S. dollar took a beating against other fiat currencies.  As such, some analysts are convinced that bitcoin is now more of a macro asset, meaning it responds to large-scale events in the world's economies.  Gold and bitcoin could continue to rise as governments and central banks are unlikely to slow or halt liquidity-boosting programs launched this year to counter the coronavirus-induced recession.  Bitcoin may see stronger gains in the future, as it looks relatively cheap with prices still down 43% from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017.  The cryptocurrency has gained nearly 60% so far this year, while gold has risen by 34%.

42404911,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8QpQ,1596632886,First Mover: Ethereum’s Transition to Staking Could Push More Traders to Use Derivatives,"Ethereum’s biggest-ever upgrade is supposed to make the blockchain network faster and more efficient. But the new “staking” system could lock up so many of the network’s native ether tokens that investors who want to trade them may have to rely on derivatives markets.      The blockchain, the world's second-biggest, currently uses a validating mechanism similar to larger Bitcoin’s known as “proof-of-work,” where new data blocks and transactions are confirmed via power-hungry computers solving complex cryptographic puzzles.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Under Ethereum's multi-year upgrade now underway, the network would shift to a “proof-of-stake” model, where investors validate transactions by staking ether on the blockchain in exchange for token rewards. It's a bit like depositing dollars into a bank account for interest, paid out in dollars.      A possible consequence, though, is the new staking system could soak up as much as 30% of the ether tokens in circulation, based on estimates from Adam Cochran, a partner at MetaCartel Ventures, a decentralized investment firm. An address needs to stake at least 32 ether tokens, worth about $12,400 at the current price, to become a validator in the proof-of-stake model.      “It's possible to see a future scenario where the incentive to keep assets locked up on-chain is so great as to remove some liquidity from the market,” says Diogo Monica, co-founder and president of the digital-asset custodian Anchorage, told CoinDesk in an email.    Lost liquidity    In May, a survey by the Ethereum developer Consensys found that 65% of ether investors were planning to stake the cryptocurrency under the new system, known as Ethereum 2.0, and half of those wanted to run validator nodes.      Most staking mechanisms have a lock-up period. Rocket Pool Staking, an Ethereum 2.0 staking service, offers staking terms ranging from three months to a year.      Some ether tokens might get locked in staking as the network upgrade proceeds. Ethereum 2.0 is being rolled out in three phases of what could end up being a multiyear process, with the original proof-of-work blockchain running in parallel until the two networks are merged at “Phase 1.5.”      Wilson Withiam, a research analyst at the cryptocurrency data firm Messari, told CoinDesk that “ethers sent to the deposit contract will likely remain locked up” until Phase 1.5, and “that could cause a decline in the amount of ether readily available.”    Staking derivatives market?    Cryptocurrency analysts say ether-staking yields of 3% to 5% would be so tantalizing – at a time when government bonds carry near-zero or even negative yields – that few investors would opt to leave their tokens in Uniswap or other decentralized trading systems where they could be accessed by traders.      “In that case, people will have an incentive to create ways to buy and sell ether shares that abstract whether the underlying asset is currently being staked,” Monica said.      Derivatives might be a solution.      Fixed income from staking could even be packaged as a distinct product. Holders who stake their coins could create voucher tokens representing a claim on the stake. Then they could trade the tokens for ether or other cryptocurrencies. So buyers could capture the yield without having to own the underlying asset.      As an alternative to selling voucher tokens, holders could deposit ether as collateral on decentralized lending and borrowing platforms.      Messari’s Withiam says he thinks staking derivatives are inevitable.      “It will give traders access to tradable assets so that they can continue to do what they do best,” Withiam said. “Exchanges will be able to offer new markets around these assets and potentially lock customers within their product suite if the synthetic assets aren’t transferable outside of the exchange.”      For now, all this really just amounts to speculation over how speculators will want to speculate on ether.      But there's no lack of motivation: Plenty of cryptocurrency analysts say it’s possible ether’s price could jump as demand increases for tokens to stake. Ether's price has tripled this year to about $390. Such returns far exceed bitcoin's 56% gain on the year.      “Financial incentive to buy and hold both increases the security of the network, and could lead to dramatic price appreciation,” said Connor Abendschein, an analyst at the research firm Digital Assets Data.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $11,509 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,521 | 24-Hr Low: $11,045      Trend: Bitcoin is showing signs of life with a near 3% rise to over $11,500 on Wednesday after a lackluster day yesterday.      The bulls will be hoping to maintain a foothold above $11,400, having failed to keep gains above that level in the previous two trading days. If successful, stronger buying interest may emerge, pushing prices to the psychological hurdle of $12,000 – last put to test on July 27.      However, if the market fails to absorb selling pressure above $10,400, a re-test of the daily chart support at around $10,900 may be seen.      A continued bullish scenario looks likely with gold, an inflation-hedge, rallying to record highs above $2,000 and the U.S. dollar losing ground across the board. Both bitcoin and gold have recently moved in tandem, with Goldman Sachs warning that the greenback could lose its global reserve status.      The overall bias will stay bullish as long as prices are held above the former hurdle-turned-support at $10,500 (February high).",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/05/first-mover-ethereums-transition-to-staking-could-push-more-traders-to-use-derivatives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a15548de6b53ebc6cb1220782de390e664876a9c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Wednesday, custody provider First Digital Trust (FDT) will be responsible for storing BnkToTheFuture's client crypto and fiat currency assets.  BnkToTheFuture CEO Simon Dixon told CoinDesk the most important difference will be that client money is ""legally segregated"" under a trust structure, but there is no guarantee of segregation at a bank.  This means a bank can further invest client's funds at will, while assets held in a trust cannot be used for other purposes without first obtaining permission from the client.  Shifting assets to a trust would help protect them against a potential ""systemic risk event"" in the banking sector resulting from expected economic disruption, Dixon said.  This, he told CoinDesk, would help develop trust among investors and help create an industry standard for crypto custodians.  The move came as Cayman Islands-based BnkToTheFuture was developing new crypto retirement plan products expected to go live later in 2020.  Using FDT's trust structure will help enable clients to store assets in perpetuity for inheritance planning, according to the announcement.  First Digital CEO Vincent Chok echoed Dixon's comments, saying that, with a recession approaching, investors need a way to protect their assets from ""exposure to fractional reserve banking.""

Announced Tuesday, the San Francisco payments company said revenue made from selling bitcoin to its Cash App customers in Q2 came to a total of $875 million, six times the amount in the same period in 2019.  Square stresses it only takes a ""small margin"" selling bitcoin to customers, but Q2's results still mean it made $17 million profit – up 711% year over year.  Square released its results ahead of schedule after someone gained ""early external access."" It hasn't provided any further details on what happened.  Since Square first enabled bitcoin buying through its Cash App in November 2017, it has grown to become a dominant part of the business.  While bitcoin made up only 5% of its revenue at $34 million in Q1 2018, it came to $65.5 million in the same quarter in 2019.  By Q4 2019, Square's bitcoin revenue reached $178 million and $306 million in Q1 2020, $100 million more than the revenue generated from its fiat services.  But Tuesday's results represent one of the biggest increases in quarter-to-quarter revenue to date. The company attributes the rise to a surge in customer demand and volumes as well as an increase in bitcoin's circulating supply.  Square excludes bitcoin revenue from its total figures, saying that incorporating something so unpredictable and volatile into its results would make it hard to gauge the company's overall performance.

Using the online handle ""buyersclub,"" Pate is said to have advertised the sale of an ""old formula"" of OxyContin that can be crushed and then inhaled or injected. (Newer versions are designed to be tamper-resistant to prevent this from happening.)  Bulk shipments of the drugs were sent in pill form from Costa Rica to U.S.-based co-conspirators, who would then reship orders to a list of customers, the Justice Dept. said.  The drugs were often hidden inside tourist souvenirs such as maracas on the journey from Costa Rica to the U.S.  After a customer had received the shipment, the dark-web markets would allegedly release the customer's bitcoin funds held in escrow to Pate.  Both men are Costa Rican citizens, while Pate is also a U.S. citizen.  “We are firmly committed to combatting the problem of opioid abuse and breaking through sophisticated cyber-enabled barriers employed by criminals to hide their activities,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin.

Lloyd Fournier became the latest out of nearly a dozen Bitcon contributors sponsored by Square Crypto in some form when the payments firm announced he would receive a grant on Aug. 3. Fournier’s grant proposal said he plans to experiment with payment channels and the Lightning Network, exploring options comparable to the oracles popularized by decentralized finance (DeFi) systems.  Yet another Lightning developer, Evan Kaloudis, earned a HRF grant for his work on Zeus, an iOS and Android app for using a Lightning node on a phone with privacy tools like a VPN or Tor on Aug. 4.  With regards to CoinJoins, HRF funded a developer who goes by Openoms, the creator of JoinInbox, that makes it easier for bitcoiners to transact in a relatively private and decentralized way using a Raspberry Pi microcomputer to access JoinMarket, a grassroots CoinJoin option.  The creator of Fully Noded, who goes by Fontaine, received an HRF grant to continue work on his Tor-friendly iOS app for using a bitcoin node on a regular mobile phone.  The HRF grants are 1 bitcoin each, or just over $11,000 as of press time.
