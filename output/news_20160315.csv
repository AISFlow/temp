42426714,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9fh,1458084357,21 Inc Launches First Proof-of-Concept for Bitcoin Computer Network,"With its signature hardware product now shipping to users in the US, Canada and Europe, 21 Inc is seeking to roll out its next stage in development, a decentralized, bitcoin-incentivized network of the devices.  21 Inc  announced the launch of Ping21 today, a new proof-of-concept it envisions as a competitor to website monitoring services such as Pingdom or AlertFox. Today, webmasters use such services to determine how a website is performing in different markets, in the case of Pingdom, paying between $13 and $454 a month for the service.  What 21's grid now allows is that Bitcoin Computers all around the world to be called with a single command, a factor the company said offers advantages over the pinging networks of today.  For example, a company's website might be up and running in New York, but in Florida, Spain, and South Korea, there could be problems. However, with the Ping21 service, a webmaster could issue a single command and receive the uptime and status of their website in dozens of countries.  Rather than paying the hundreds of dollars for a subscription, the cost per ping would drop significantly, the company said. By utilizing its recently launched Micropayments Marketplace, a client can submit a request to the network along with bitcoin for payment.  Bitcoin Computers enrolled in the Ping21 service will then be automatically contacted to perform a ping, check the website, collect any necessary data and submit it back to the marketplace where the user can aggregate stats.  Afters its launch, the company is focusing on allowing developers to expand on other applications for its bitcoin-incentivized grid.  21 CEO Balaji S Srinivasan told CoinDesk:  ""It’s a proof-of-concept to show what kinds of services you can offer via decentralized bitcoin-incentivized grid computing and how they are qualitatively different from – and complementary to – what you can get from centralized cloud computing.""  Sharing economy for machines  While the Ping21 is one possible implementation of the bitcoin-incentivized grid, this concept of a many-to-one ping service opens up others avenues for machines to transact.  With each device having its own wallet, 21 Bitcoin Computers can buy and sell data in ways that would otherwise have not been possible, the company contends.  Srinivasan explained that over the coming weeks, 21 would be announcing further proofs-of-concept to demonstrate how its grid could be used in applications for the Internet of Things.  Tyler Pate, a software and hardware engineer at 21, echoed this larger vision stating that he expects 21 users to innovate by exploring new ways to monetize data and services.  ""We think the ability to easily monetize data will give both individuals and corporations motivation for expanded innovation in connected devices,"" he said.  Andrew DeSantis, an engineer at 21, explained that the ability to send and receive bitcoin payments from machine to machine has the potential to unlock a new kind of ""machine economy"" in which machines routinely trade data and services for bitcoin.  He said:  ""By using bitcoin microtransactions to incentivize machine operators, we can now get very accurate real-time readings of network conditions from around the world.""  DeSantis explained that when the 21 Free Client is released, there could be nodes in thousands of locations, creating a complete planetary web of machines that are buying and selling information. All of this becomes possible without a human needing to initiate each action.  ""It’s not just about people to machines, but also machine to machine, too,"" Pate said. ""Capturing data is nothing new. But being able to monetize little bits of it on a massively distributed scale is.""  Free market  21 sees the proof-of-concept as step one in a larger vision of creating a free market maintained by Bitcoin Computers.  For example, DeSantis speculated that there is the potential for market-based dynamics to develop, whereby those in densely populated areas, nodes will have to compete to sell data.  ""So in New York City, it has a lot of endpoints. There could be hundreds or thousands of people selling the weather or offering their pinging service to you. In Nebraska, though, there might be far fewer endpoints, which means that those users could charge more,"" DeSantis explained.  He compared variable pricing to the way surge pricing works with Uber. When there are a lot of cars on the road, but demand is relatively low, the price remains at the 1x multiplier. However, if it is rainy or rush hour, more people will begin demanding the service, thus increasing the multiplier.  On top of supply and demand market dynamics, the pricing could continue to rise to incentivize those that otherwise don’t want to connect to the network. Pate explained that part of running one of these nodes was the ability to choose which APIs to connect to.  Pate even went so far as to speak to the implications of allowing Internet users to reclaim ownership of their data.  Pate concluded:  ""People will feel better about selling datasets they want to, instead of having it automatically collected. This gives the decision power back to the individual, instead of being opted in to give valuable data without consent.""

42426697,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9Dh,1458078009,Study: Blockchain Tech Low on Finance Sector’s Priority List,"Many financial services executives say blockchain technology is low on their corporate priority list, according to a new survey from professional services firm PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC).  The new report  , which focuses on global trends in financial technology, drew responses from 544 participants, including C-level executives as well as innovation directors and managers from firms in the banking, insurance, asset management and FinTech industries.  Most respondents said they were, at best, ""moderately familiar"" with the technology, with less than 5% indicating that they are ""extremely familiar"". PwC's data suggests that knowledge about blockchain tech is more prevalent in banking and payments circles compared to the insurance and asset management sectors.  The report states:  ""Compared to the other trends, blockchain ranks lower on the agendas of survey participants. While a majority of respondents (56%) recognise its importance, 57% say they are unsure or unlikely to respond to this trend.""  ""This lack of understanding may lead market participants to underestimate the potential impact of blockchain on their activities,"" the authors continued.  PwC is one of several major professional services companies looking to carve out market share in the blockchain space. It recently announced partnerships with industry startups such as Blockstream, Digital Asset Holdings and Eris Industries.

42398926,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgT0,1458069578,US Judge Rules Mt Gox Class Action Can Continue Against Mizuho Bank,"A US district judge has rejected a claim by Mizuho Bank that a class action lawsuit related to its relationship with failed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox should be moved to Japan.  Once the largest global bitcoin exchange, Tokyo-based Mt Gox collapsed in 2014, eventually filing for bankruptcy. Since then, the exchange, and its founder and CEO Mark Karpeles, have been embroiled in a lawsuits from customers seeking to recover millions in customer funds that remain unaccounted for.  Mizuho was first named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit brought by former exchange users in March 2014 as it served as Mt Gox’s banking partner, receiving fiat funds deposited by customers into the exchange and held by Mt Gox.  In the latest ruling, U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman criticized actions taken by the bank, suggesting it profited from its affiliation with Mt Gox even as it sought to limit the number and amount of customer withdrawals over concerns regarding its liability for deficiencies in the exchange’s business model.  Feinerman wrote:  ""Mizuho's qualms about handling Mt. Gox’s business did not extend, however, to receiving fiat currency from Mt. Gox users for deposit into the Mt. Gox account. Even as it limited and then barred withdrawals, Mizuho continued to accept deposits from Mt Gox users, earning revenue from the associated service fees.""  The ruling goes so far as to allege that Mizuho prevented Mt Gox from telling customers that the bank was the cause of withdrawal issues, or that it was seeking to terminate its relationship with the now-defunct bitcoin exchange.  “Mizuho knew that if Mt Gox’s members learned of its prohibition on withdrawals of fiat currency from Mt Gox’s Mizuho account, members would stop making deposits and Mizuho would stop collecting the associated fees,” Feinerman wrote.  The class action lawsuit alleges that Mizuho ""tortiously interfered"" with the plaintiffs agreements with Mt Gox by affecting its ability to conduct business, and that it unjustly enriched itself through these actions.  In statements, representatives from Edelson PC lauded the decision, stating:  ""Mizuho Bank is alleged to have committed fraud specifically against US citizens. The court was correct to allow these victims their day in a US court.""  Lawsuit relocation  While Feinerman denied Mizuho’s request, he did find that the class action lawsuit would need to produce a new plaintiff, or otherwise be required to move to the Central District of California.  At issue is that the lawsuit was brought by Illinois resident Gregory Greene, an individual who never sent fiat funds to the exchange, and as a result, never had ""transactional contacts"" with Mizuho.  ""Plaintiffs have not established that Mizuho Bank had sufficient suit-related contacts with Illinois to meet the standard articulated in Walden v Fiore, or that their claims arose out of Mizuho Bank’s contracts with Illinois,"" the judge wrote.  As a result, Feinerman stated that the case should be moved to California, as plaintiff Joseph Lack transferred funds from his local bank to Mizuho.  ""Mizuho knowingly accepted a deposit from a bank it knew to be in California and from somebody it knew to be a California resident, knowing that it would not allow that money to be withdrawn, despite having concealed the no-withdrawal policy for the purpose of enticing such deposits,"" he wrote.  However, prior to transferring the case, the judge is allowing the lawsuit to add an additional plaintiff who might better represent the lawsuit and its grounds for location in Illinois.  Feinerman concluded:  ""If counsel fails to do so, this case will be transferred to the Central District of California.""

42398914,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgHC,1458064702,Researchers Propose Blockchain for Central Banks But Bank of England Not Involved,"Two London researchers have proposed a new kind of cryptocurrency for central banks, one that puts command of the network in control of a central authority while retaining a transparent, distributed ledger.  First presented at the Network & Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium in San Diego, the RSCoin concept was developed by George Danezis and Sarah Meiklejohn of University College London.  In their introductory white paper, Danezis and Meiklejohn argue that the bitcoin network suffers from a scalability problem tied to its computationally intensive mining process, by which energy is expended to secure a reliable ledger of transactions.  Under the proposed RSCoin framework, this responsiblity would be handled by a network of known validators called ""mintettes"".  The authors state:  ""RSCoin's radical shift from traditional cryptocurrencies is to centralize the monetary supply. Every unit of a particular currency is created by a particular central bank, making cryptocurrencies based on RSCoin significantly more palatable to governments. Despite this centralization, RSCoin still provides the benefit over existing (non-crypto) currencies of a transparent transaction ledger, a distributed system for maintaining it, and a globally visible monetary supply.""  ""This makes monetary policy transparent, allows direct access to payments and value transfers, supports pseudonymity, and benefits from innovative uses of blockchains and digital money,"" the authors continue.  Danezis and Meiklejohn told CoinDesk that the project has been conducted independently of the Bank of England, which has recently floated the idea of issuing its own digital currency based, at least in part, on bitcoin.  ""I'd like to make it clear right away ... that the work was absolutely not funded by the bank,"" Meiklejohn said, adding that it did not speak to the bank prior to embarking on the effort.  It was inspired, they say, by the central bank's digital currency research agenda.  Centralized coin  Among the major differences between RSCoin and bitcoin, according to the white paper, is the exact purpose of the network validators, or mintettes.  The authors state that rather than a relying on a system of potentially anonymous miners contributing hashing power to solve the next transaction block, mintettes are authorized to bundle and transmit transactions by the central network authority.  ""Briefly, mintettes collect transactions from users and collate them into blocks, much as is done with traditional cryptocurrencies,"" the authors explain. ""These mintettes differ from traditional cryptocurrency miners, however, in a crucial way: rather than performing some computationally difficult task, each mintette is simply authorized by the central bank to collect transactions.""  Danezis framed the project as one that is in progress, stating that ""there are no plans to operate RSCoin"".  “The current implementation is incomplete, and mostly geared towards the performance evaluation for the scientific paper,” he told CoinDesk. ""We have no plans to build a complete monetary system, and neither does anyone else as far as we know.""

42398925,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgS1,1458057165,Microsoft Adds 5 New Blockchain Partners to Azure,"Tech giant Microsoft has added five new services to its Azure blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) solution, including decentralized prediction market Augur and Ethereum startup Slock.it.  Other new additions to its blockchain testbed, announced in October, include custom blockchain development platform Lisk; digital asset platform BitShares; and alternative blockchain Syscoin. BitPay, Eris Industries and Factom are among a number of previously announced partners.  In a blog post, Microsoft director of technology strategy Marley Gray sought to position the company’s blockchain offerings as representing a diversity of the technologies currently available in the market.  The news follows notable announcements from Augur, which launched its public beta yesterday, and Slock.it, which saw its preferred blockchain technology, Ethereum, launch a production-ready implementation after years in development.  For the Azure platform, the additions are the latest that find Microsoft working toward the creation of a ""certified blockchain marketplace"", that could soon see previously announced partners pass more stringent vetting.

42398916,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgK9,1458051005,Blockchain Consortium R3 Opens New Round of Partnerships,"Blockchain consortium startup R3CEV is now accepting applications for new partners as part of a second round of engagements.  Launched in 2015, R3 has so far formed relationships with 43 major banks, with its initial round comprising 42 partners. This includes Banco Santander, JPMorgan, and most recently, Japan’s SBI Holdings, which became the first of the new round to announce it had joined earlier this week.  The startup had previously indicated its ""initial window"" for partnerships had closed in December, but in an interview R3 managing director Charley Cooper reported that the second round officially opened last week.  He said SBI was the first to sign on, though he expects more announcements to be forthcoming.  Cooper told CoinDesk:  ""The strategy hasn’t changed. We had always anticipated having a second round of engagements. We’re now in the process of talking to buy-sides, infrastructure providers and other potential partners.""

42398929,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgWw,1458045042,Blockai Raises $547k for Blockchain Digital Rights Platform,"Blockai has announced it has raised $547,000 in seed funding to relaunch as a blockchain copyright service.  Originally envisioned as a ‘Netscape for Bitcoin’ in 2015, Blockai (pronounced 'block-i') attempted to turn the blockchain into a kind of social media stream that would allow users to send messages and authenticate items. Now, Blockai is bidding for a new life as a tool that allows artists to authenticate and claim copyright over images.  According to AngelList, Social Starts, Sterling VC and Vectr Ventures contributed funding alongside roughly 15 angel investors including Betfair founder Josh Hannah and Epsilon Records founder Nate Houk.  In interview, CEO Nathan Lands called the latest version of the Blockai product ""dramatically different"" from its initial release, indicating that now any use of bitcoin or the blockchain is largely hidden from users.  Lands told CoinDesk:  ""Artists don’t want to send bitcoin. So we simplified [Blockai] down and found that was something people wanted, a simple way to get proof of ownership.""  A similar idea is currently being approached by blockchain industry startups Ascribe and Mediachain, among others, though Lands sought to position Blockai as more user-friendly.  Further, investors sought to stress the size of Blockai's potential market as a reason for their support.  ""By just looking at the size and value of stock photography libraries and the myriad of photo storage services professionals use like Flickr, Google Photos and Apple's iCloud you can start to understand the scale of how useful Blockai can be and that's just digital photos,"" investor Ron Williams told CoinDesk.  Pricing tiers  While other startups focused on this use case are hoping to attract customers with a freemium model, Blockai has a different approach.  The startup now changes a small cost to handle the insertion of records into the bitcoin blockchain, sending payments from its wallet through to the network.  To users, Blockai offers three packages for credits on its service, charging between $0.20 and $0.50 per registration through Stripe.  Lands positioned the price of the service as a benefit to users, as he said it reduces the likelihood that a user would fraudulently claim ownership of any works.  ""In artist interviews, we've found that artists wanted us to charge so they know how we make money, there isn't some kind of thing where 'we'll figure it out later', which for them could mean that we'll force advertising on them,"" he said.  Using the service  At sign up, Blockai offers users one free credit to trial the service.  Users are first prompted to drag and drop a file for which they wish to claim ownership.  Blockai then creates a record of the file in the bitcoin blockchain, producing a certificate that artists can maintain for recordkeeping.  Lands contends that the certificate could be valuable should the artist ever seek to bring a lawsuit against someone for infringement, even if the legal validity of this claim hasn't be tested.  ""The certificate includes metadata that is uniquely links back to their name and email address and includes data such as the hash, date registered, file size and file type,"" he said.  Still, Lands acknowledged that the service can help provide an extra layer or protection for this class of professionals.  Lands went on to state that he believes his work is step one of a larger opportunity that could be seized by the startup, concluding:  ""There is a still a tremendous amount of work to be done related to digital media assets and putting individuals in control of their creations on the Internet. We strongly believe that all starts with the registration process.""
