According to a Jan. 8 statement, the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit and the Financial Supervisory Service want to know whether the banks – which offer accounts for cryptocurrency trading – are properly complying with anti-money laundering and customer identification rules.  ""The inspectors will look into whether the banks comply with their anti-money laundering (AML) obligations in their transaction with cryptocurrency exchanges; and whether they have in place appropriate measures to verify their customers' identification in regard with cryptocurrency trading,"" the agencies remarked.  The release went on to note that officials will also investigate whether the banks have electronic systems to match deposit holders' names with virtual account holders and if the banks can halt transactions with exchanges which refuse to provide customer information, among other areas.  The release noted that the South Korean government is monitoring cryptocurrency trading, concluding:  ""The government continues to review all possible options including shutdown of cryptocurrency exchanges in order to maximize side effects of cryptocurrency trading - fraud using cryptocurrencies, cyber hacks on cryptocurrency exchanges, and irrationally overheated speculation.""  Less than a week ago, South Korean news organization Yonhap News announced that the country would begin implementing its new cryptocurrency exchange regulations later this month. Officials first revealed plans to more closely police Korea's exchange ecosystem in December.

In a Jan. 8 statement, ViaBTC said that it would shut down the market – through which users can purchase contracts entitling them to a certain amount of hashing power (and the associated cryptocurrency payouts) – on Jan. 10. The reason: the company wants to ""control speculation and protect the interests of our investors.""  ""Please finish all your cloud mining contract trading ASAP. Thank you all for your support,"" ViaBTC added.  ViaBTC first launched its cloud mining service in November 2016.  The closure comes months after ViaBTC shut down its cryptocurrency exchange in response to a crackdown by Chinese authorities on the country's exchange ecosystem, a process that began in 2017. Officials also moved to prohibit the use of initial coin offerings (ICOs) in September.  Yet while there's no clear indication that the two events are related, the latest announcement follows new reports that officials in China are seeking a gradual shutdown of domestic bitcoin mining operations.  According to documents circulated over the weekend and attributed to the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation, a Chinese regulator, officials want to curb support for local miners, calling for measures around power and land use. One of the documents requested that officials prepare plans for such a process by the 10th.  A representative from the agency's Xinjiang office confirmed the documentation's veracity to Quartz but declined to comment further.  As further illustrated by Bloomberg, miners in China are shifting their footprint away from the country, eyeing new locations in Europe and North America.

Sen. Alison Clarkson introduced the bill on Jan. 3, public records show, and the measure has since been forwarded to the Committee on Economic Development, Housing and General Affairs.  In addition to mandating several reports on cryptocurrencies and blockchain, it notably outlines how the state could classify certain firms as ""digital currency limited liability companies,"" particularly those that operate their own networks.  Those companies would, if the bill is approved, be required to pay ""in the form of its digital currency a transaction tax equivalent to $0.01"" whenever a new unit of cryptocurrency is created, traded or transferred.  ""A digital currency limited liability company is exempt from taxes otherwise applicable,"" reads the bill, which states in its opening:  ""This bill proposes to implement strategies relating to blockchain, cryptocurrency, and financial technology in order to: promote regulatory efficiency; enable business organizational and governance structures that may expand opportunities in financial technology; and promote education and adoption of financial technology in the public and private sectors.""  It also outlines protections for how firms govern the protocols that underly a particular cryptocurrency. Those companies ""may adopt any reasonable algorithmic means for accomplishing the consensus process"" and, in line with the provision, ""provide for the modification of the consensus process or the substitution of a new process that complies with the requirements of the law.""  The submission is perhaps unsurprising, given the past interest that has been shown by lawmakers in the state. The legislature approved a blockchain study in June, seeking to assess how the state's job market may be affected. In 2016, lawmakers finalized a law that made blockchain data admissible as evidence in court.  Clarkson's new bill also calls for a ""Fintech Summit,"" which would bring together state and industry stakeholders to discuss how Vermont can promote the tech's wider use. The state would devote $25,000 to help fund the event, under the auspices of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development.

This morning we excluded some Korean exchanges in price calculations due to the extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity. We are working on better tools to provide users with the averages that are most relevant to them.        — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) January 8, 2018          CoinMarketCap, perhaps the go-to source for cryptocurrency market data, has sparked an uproar after it moved to exclude South Korean exchanges from its price average calculations.  The unannounced move to remove data from Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit from its average calculations sparked confusion given that its front-page suggests a broad decline in the cryptocurrency market, including what appeared to be a near-30% fall in the price of XRP.  The overall market cap of the market – one measure by which traders assess the ecosystem – dropped sharply once the change went into effect, which appears to have taken place just before 5 a.m. UTC.  That shift can be notably seen in the 24-hour price chart for bitcoin cash, given that the three Korean exchanges are among the top-10 by trade volume for the cryptocurrency.  The exact reason for pulling the data isn't clear at this time, though as of press time Bithumb is offline because of what the exchange says is a server check. And prices on those exchanges have consistently traded far above the rest of the market, such as the more than $5,000 spread spread compared to markets like Bitfinex and GDAX.  Further, commentators like Ripple chief cryptographer David Schwartz, who tweeted out about the move, said the newly-reflected price is ""more accurate and meaningful.""  That sentiment hasn't spared CoinMarketCap from the crypto-community's ire, however.  Social media posts across Reddit and Twitter have chastised the site, crying foul about the lack of any formal announcement that they say led to an actual price decline as traders reacted to what they perceived as a tumbling market.  And while CoinMarketCap excluded Korean exchanges from its data, other data sites showed similar declines in asset prices.  OnChain FX's  data matched CoinMarketCap's prices, yet CoinCap, while still showing declines in pricing for most of the top 50 crypto-assets, displayed higher prices for bitcoin, ether, XRP and bitcoin cash than CoinMarketCap did.  Similarly, data site LiveCoinWatch showed bitcoin falling to $14,787, somewhere between CoinMarketCap' $14,754 and CoinCap's $15,596 at time of writing.  The changes in the different sites' data go beyond just prices. Whereas LiveCoinWatch still shows XRP as the second-largest asset by market cap, the other data sites now show ethereum retaking its former spot.  Representatives for CoinMarketCap did not immediately respond to a submitted request for comment.

UBI – which, as previously reported by Bloomberg, says it is developing a product tracking system using the tech – will see trading of its stock frozen from 9:30 a.m. ET this morning until Jan. 22, according to a statement from the U.S. regulator.  The SEC said that it was moving to halt trading due to questions about its recent public filings as well as market activity around the company's stock, which according to MarketWatch has seen its price jump more than 2,000 percent in the past year.  The agency explained:  ""The Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of UBIA because of (i) questions regarding the accuracy of assertions, since at least September 2017, by UBIA in filings with the Commission regarding the company’s business operations; and (ii) concerns about recent, unusual and unexplained market activity in the company’s Class A common stock since at least November 2017.""

42428402,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7h5h,1515420003,Banks and the Blockchain Blues,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Like the misleading opening of a well-crafted thriller, the blockchain bustle in the banking sector is sending a confusing message.  To see how, let's take a brief look at the timeline:  In 2013, the news was full of banks shutting down bitcoin company accounts and worrying about being displaced by the innovation.  This continued in 2014, while a handful of brave institutions began to look at the underlying technology.  In 2015, we started to see the emergence of ""thought leadership"" from some incumbents, as well as promises of imminent blockchain trials and launches.  These began to materialize and multiply in 2016, as use-case testing spread.  And in 2017, we have seen an even greater number of trials, proofs-of-concept and prototypes, as well as the growth of financial consortiums.  It appears that confidence is increasing.  Or is it?  Given the seemingly frenzied activity over the past couple of years, we should be asking ourselves where the results are. Successful trials are great, but why have they not led to real-world use? Why is there so much applause and fanfare for work that has yet to show a practical application in banking? Why have countless promised deadlines come and gone with no follow-up?  Superimpose the scarcity of implemented blockchain projects over the subsequent silence around most of the trials from 2015-2017, and the implied confidence that we are close to useful solutions starts to weaken.  Two sides  On the one hand, I don't want to belittle the considerable investment that has been sunk into blockchain explorations in finance. Far from it, the knowledge acquired is an essential building block in the systems of tomorrow, in finance and other sectors.  And I still believe that finance – the ""plumbing"" of our economy – is one of the more compelling use cases for the technology.  What's more, there is plenty of interesting stuff going on. Trade finance and cross-border applications are two main areas of focus, and we will almost certainly see solid progress in these applications over the next couple of years. And many other intriguing trials are far along, with possible launches in 2018.  But on the other hand, the empty promises and quiet disappointments are starting to take their toll.  Interesting reports are getting lost in the noise, as most announcements these days appear to be along the lines of, ""Hey, we're looking at blockchain!"" – it would be more surprising to read a headline proclaiming that a bank is not interested in the technology.  With so many consortiums to join, potential use cases to announce and opinions on bitcoin to share with the world, it’s getting easier than ever for a bank's PR department to get its name in the press.  Be careful what you wish for  This is self-defeating.  First, there’s the loss of credibility. Looking back at the broken assurances from the past two years, we understandably take today's pronouncements with a grain of salt.  Second, there’s the creeping suspicion that the technology isn't all it's cracked up to be. If it was so good at streamlining processes and reducing costs, why isn't it already in the field?  Third, the level of noise is starting to induce an indifference to the progress. I’m sure I'm not the only one for whom bank CEO pronouncements trigger a boredom-induced numbness. And every time I read that a consortium has added yet another member, I'm reminded of what the collective brain power has yet to produce.  If the PR agencies could quieten down a bit, and if the press could be more selective about what it writes up, we could get a better sense of what really is happening ""under the hood.""  Unfortunately, PR agencies and marketers are not known for their restraint. And us journalists and commentators need to inform you of what the incumbents are doing, even if it's just talking, since they are both enablers and barriers to widespread adoption.  So, I expect that in 2018 we will continue to see empty announcements and mindshare positioning from the banking sector. The noise level will continue to increase, compounded by even more opinions on cryptocurrencies and token sales, as well as a stream of ""me too"" experiments that seem to repeat what has already been done.  My wish list  However, the eternal optimist in me hopes that the flurry will soon start to condense into substance.  The scattershot approach of many blockchain teams will consolidate into a few viable projects, as most use case explorations end up shelved due to regulatory obstacles, scant engagement or lack of buy-in from senior management. The ""low-hanging fruit"" targets will gradually be replaced with distributed ledgers, and lessons learned will nourish more complex ambitions.  Instead of fluff pieces that regurgitate press releases, the media will start to use its deepening knowledge to more carefully select what’s worth writing about, and will spend more time talking to those actually doing the work. PR agencies will start to turn down the volume, realising that we’re not so gullible anymore.  And perhaps we'll be able to talk more about how hard it is to go from lab to production, the difficulty of choosing the right problem to work on, the risk of operating in regulatory fog, and the struggle to get not only senior management buy-in but also the requisite partners on board. We would love to learn from mistakes, to hear more about the successful trials stuck in limbo, and to get a glimpse of what criteria are used in deciding to abandon a project.  That said, I also hope 2018 brings productive success to all those, in finance or not, who are working on blockchain applications – we are looking forward to reporting on your hard-won successful implementations that bring us a step closer to a better distributed and more trustworthy financial system.

Voatz is a mobile voting platform that uses blockchain technology to ensure secure record-keeping and identity verification. The platform has already been deployed by universities, state political groups, and non-profit organizations for their internal voting functions, the release states.  According to Andrew Maguire, investor at Oakhouse Partners, Voatz combines biometrics and blockchain technology, benefits that would increase voters' confidence and participation.

42428409,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7hDh,1515413417,Bitcoin Faces Bear Move as Price Drops Toward $15K,"Bitcoin is looking weak today after prices failed to hold above $17,000 levels at the weekend.  Coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) fell to a low of $15,253 earlier today and was last seen trading at $15,345 levels. According to data source OnChainFX, bitcoin (BTC) has depreciated by 8.86 percent in the last 24 hours.  Notably, fears of a China crackdown on bitcoin mining may have weakened the bid tone around the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Caixin Global  reported last week that local regulators in China may not longer offer discounted electricity and tax deductions to mining companies. Further, a leaked document now suggests that China's top internet finance regulator is requesting that local governments push bitcoin-mining operations towards an ""orderly exit"" from the industry.  Given that China is the world’s capital of bitcoin mining, and accounts for more than two-thirds of the world's processing power devoted to the process of securing the network, such moves – if proved to be genuine – could bring more pressure to prices of the cryptocurrency.  The technical chart also indicates an increased risk of a bearish breakdown.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  Bear flag – a bearish continuation pattern. A downside break – i.e. a close below $14,460 (flag support) – would indicate the corrective rally from the low of $10,400 (Dec. 22 low) has ended and the sell-off from the record high of $19,891 has resumed.  The relative strength index (RSI) is back below 50.00 (bearish territory).  Since Dec. 21, trading volumes have remained well below the 30-day moving average. A sharp rise in volume on negative price action today (today) would boost odds of a bearish breakdown in prices.  View  A high volume bearish flag breakdown (close below $14,460) would open doors for a drop to $10,400 (Dec. 22 low). A violation there would expose the next support lined up at $9,965 (100-day MA).  Bullish scenario: Only an upside break of the flag would revive the bull run and shift risk in favor of rally to fresh record highs above $20,000.

42428398,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7gxh,1515409211,Indian Lawyer Files Petition Demanding Cryptocurrency Regulations,"An Indian lawyer has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking to force action on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the country.  Bivas Chatterjee, a Kolkata-based advocate who also serves as the state government's nodal officer for cyber crime cases, filed the PIL at the city's high court Friday, demanding a legal framework for cryptocurrencies in India. In his petition, the lawyer said that rules are required since cryptocurrencies have been linked to money laundering, drug trafficking and other illegal activities on the dark web.  According to the Times of India, the filing comes in the wake of the arrest of two youths in Kolkata last month by country's Narcotics Control Bureau for procuring and selling drugs through the dark web using bitcoin.  Chatterjee pointed out that the economic impact of ""decentralised, unregulated and unaccounted parallel economic system"" is vast, alleging that cryptocurrencies are used to fund money laundering, terrorism activities and tax evasion.  The petition states:  ""There is an urgent need to frame a joint panel or a group of committees with experts from various fields to ensure the legality and accountability of cryptocurrency.""  He added that the ""absence of controlling authorities"" has also led to the recent ""upheaval"" in the prices of cryptocurrencies.  Chatterjee argued that the government should either ban bitcoin or form a regulatory body to control the market, the Indian Express reports.  The high court is reportedly expected to hear the case on Feb. 2.  In April 2017, a committee of government and central bank officials in the country came up with a plan to consider new regulations related to digital currencies. The committee prepared a report that put forward policies related to money laundering and consumer protection.  Later, in November, the country's supreme court asked the government to respond to calls to regulate bitcoin.  Recently, India's finance minister, Arun Jaitley, clarified that the government does not recognize bitcoin as legal tender. However, he noted that ""recommendations are being worked at"" to regulate the cryptocurrency.

42428403,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7h3h,1515402038,I Love Bitcoin. That's Why I Sue Exchanges,"David Silver is the founder of Silver Miller, one of the preeminent plaintiffs' law firms in crypto litigation. Silver Miller prosecutes cases against wayward cryptocurrency exchanges and misleadingly presented crypto-investment offerings. The firm is focused on representing victims of financial fraud.    The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.        ""You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe  whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland,  and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.""  – Morpheus, ""The Matrix"" (1999)    I grew up the son of a personal injury lawyer in New York and have been exposed to the law my entire life. I worked in Washington, D.C. for nearly 10 years at one of the largest and fanciest law firms in the country before I started my own firm. I have even represented high-profile and high-net-worth people and companies.  None of this fully prepared me for my entry into the world of digital currency. It was like Keanu Reeves entering his own digital world in ""The Matrix,"" and it happened at a South Beach bar in 2014.  After a few drinks, one of my friends took out his smartphone and sent me 5 BTC to impress our other friends. Much like when Neo swallowed the red pill that was offered to him, getting those bitcoin introduced me to a Wonderland in which I learn every day how much deeper the rabbit hole goes. (By the way: Thank you, unnamed friend! I have yet to move those bitcoin and have them sitting in the same wallet where you placed them almost four years ago!)  But I'm also active in the industry in another way.  In the last three years, I have filed lawsuits against Cryptsy, Coinbase, Kraken, Tezos and Monkey Capital to name a few. More lawsuits are coming in the days, weeks and months ahead. Dare I say, I have filed more litigation in this space than any other lawyer in the country. I travel the country speaking at conferences, lectures and on TV.  I have been quoted in articles published by CoinDesk, Reuters, Bloomberg and The Financial Times regarding cryptocurrency and bitcoin as an investment.  People ask me all the time: ""Is bitcoin a good investment? If so, where should I buy it?""  From my unique perspective in the cryptocurrency Wonderland, I tell those people: ""I have absolutely no $#@#$!% idea whether the price of bitcoin is going up or down, what alternative cryptocurrency you should buy to invest in today, or where you should buy it!""  The next question is usually: ""Seriously, what should I do?"" I can only laugh and think to myself: ""If I knew the answer, I would invest myself."" For your information, I don't; simply because I do not know what the price of bitcoin is going to do. If I did, I would have invested in 2014 after my friend gave me those first five bitcoin.  The exchange lie  What I do know, and what I can speak about somewhat intelligently, is the universal myth that currently exists for people who are first experiencing cryptocurrencies: that all U.S.-based crypto exchanges are the same.  This myth is the single biggest threat to any investor money in this space. KNOW. YOUR. EXCHANGE.  There is a difference between Bittrex, Poloniex, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini and several other lesser-known exchanges. They are not the same. The prices of your crypto on the exchanges are different, the rules and regulations they follow are different, the security is different and the quality of leadership is different.  How each exchange handles challenges and adversity is different. I'm not here to endorse any of the different exchanges, but I can tell you that each one secures customer assets, handles customer issues and provides support differently. Some are akin to legitimate banks; others are more like Bernie Madoff, with the appearance of sophistication and wealth while in reality, they are just common thieves and fraudsters.  What happens when a flash crash occurs and clients lose money? What happens when that flash crash only occurs on one exchange but not others? What happens when that exchange happens to provide customers with margin trading like a traditional investment house but denies that those rules apply to them? What law applies and what government agencies have the power to enforce the theoretical laws that apply? When catastrophe strikes, what happens?  Some exchanges respond to catastrophic events by refunding their customer accounts, other exchanges tell customers they're #@$% out of luck.  While the latter might be good for my business – because wrongfully imposed customer losses are where lawsuits are usually born – that's not good for the consumer.  If you have ever heard me speak on this topic, you know I am a passionate believer that regulation is coming and that it's going to come hard and fast in the U.S.  Point of failure  That day of reckoning will collapse the weaker exchanges. Which exchanges will survive? Typically, those with the best leadership and that operate with transparency will rise to the top. As for those that fail?  Good luck collecting on your losses if you had entrusted your crypto to one of those exchanges. It's expensive, time consuming and you never know how it will turn out.  As for which ICOs are viable and which ones are not, the ability to pick a winner might be a bit easier.  The answer there is: None of them have yet proven themselves to be winners; and any of them that look like winners might not in the near future once Uncle Sam and his relatives around the world wrap their hands around ICOs and crypto-related investments.  While I believe that more people are going to join the bitcoin and cryptocurrency parade, regulation and government intervention are going to change all the rules. I have been caught on camera advising crypto companies to get a 100 percent guarantee of free legal defense fees if their companies relied on legal advice at $1,000+/hour and that advice turns out to be flat wrong.  Some of my lawsuits and the lawsuits of others will demonstrate that the fallacies that some of these companies are promoting flagrantly violate of the law. There has yet to be an ICO that did not perform that was not a security.  There, I said it. I’m sure that lost in the flood of investment opportunities is the next potential Amazon or Netflix, but for now, the safety of more traditional investments is the right choice for most people.  I find it odd and incredibly ironic that the self-proclaimed thought leaders on regulatory advice at the largest law firms charging the most per hour are the same lawyers telling media outlets that people should only invest in a crypto company an amount they can afford to lose.  That’s terrible legal advice and terrible investment advice.  My outlook  In the crypto Wonderland, an educated consumer is the best consumer.  To be clear, just because my firm is involved in litigation against an exchange or a company that raised funds via an ICO does not mean that exchange or ICO won’t survive or isn't legitimate.  To paraphrase the fictional character Amy Gardner on the TV show ""The West Wing"":  ""I've been crazy about [crypto] for longer than you've known [about it]. And I'll keep poking [it] with a stick. That's how I show my love.""  I show my love to protect my clients who were early adopters in this space and have been blown out of it by companies who believe they are above the law. I hold companies accountable as they grow and scale, and I'll keep poking those companies with my lawsuits. That does not mean I love those companies or crypto any less. As these companies grow, scale, and legitimize in the U.S., they will learn that with responsibility comes accountability.  What you say and what you do matters. If you don't believe that, either the government or a process server with a Complaint from Silver Miller is headed your way.  The upcoming year is going to be a wild ride for this space.  At FinTech 2017 in Washington, D.C., some people even claimed that 2018 is going to be ""The Year of Crypto Litigation."" They're probably right. However, if there is litigation, that means people have lost their money. That's not good for crypto consumers or crypto businesses. I hope 2018 is the year of transparency and serviceable regulation.  A pinch here and a pinch there, not too little and certainly not too much. While many of my clients began as anarchists- and libertarians-at-heart, their focus changed when bad actors did bad things to them.  When someone steals your money and you lose that which you believe belongs to you, you seek justice.  In the U.S., justice requires law and order. In one of my cases, we had to get a federal court judge to order the return to my clients of 11,000+ stolen bitcoin, presently valued at over $150 million. When my clients had their bitcoin stolen from them, they stopped caring so much about decentralization and autonomous and anonymous transactions.  At that point, they simply cared about their missing cryptocurrency.  And in an ironic twist of fate, the person who helped my clients regain their faith in the non-governmentally-regulated world of cryptocurrency was... a government officer with a robe and a gavel. Maybe some government intervention into the crypto Wonderland isn't so bad after all.

42428412,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7hLh,1515393009,Weathering the Altcoin Storm (And Investing for the Next),"Brendan Bernstein is a founding member of Tetras Capital Partners, LLC, an investment manager focused on investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets.      The crypto market moves in cycles – and understanding these cycles is key to profiting, managing risk and keeping sane.  Howard Marks describes two ways to profit from markets: (1) Hold more of the things that rise and less of the things that fall, and (2) cycle adjustment, or trying to have more risk exposure when markets rise and less when they fall.  Most people ignore the second part. Yet the key to cycle adjustment is understanding where you are in the cycle and calibrating the risks and rewards to account for it.  Similar to the broader economy, we have both short and long-term cycles. Short-term cycles are driven by the capital flows, investor composition and market sentiment. Long-term cycles result from the aggregate effects of the short-term cycles and ultimately are driven by long-term fundamentals.  The past few months in context  Over the last few months, the market has been driven by new capital entering the space and a psychological acceptance of bitcoin. The capital — both retail and institutional (i.e., new crypto hedge funds) — entered initially through the most liquid crypto assets and fiat currency onramps.  Bitcoin, being the most liquid fiat onramp, has performed well. It was also the first asset many investors became comfortable with during that time.  From July 1st to Dec. 10th, bitcoin dominance (or its percentage of total cryptocurrency market capitalization) increased from 41% to 66% – even as the overall market cap of all cryptocurrencies was increasing outside of bitcoin. BTC's price increased from $2,492 to almost $20,000.  I'll stress that this was not driven by fundamentals, but rather the capital flows and accessibility premium of bitcoin. New capital had a bias for bitcoin because it was the easiest to understand, custody and purchase.  The short-term cycle moved in BTC's favor.  The short-term crypto cycle in action  Moving toward December, the market started to become more and more dominated by retail and – let's be honest – less crypto-educated capital. Coinbase is a great proxy for this phenomenon. From June to October, Coinbase signups were relatively constant at about30,000 per day.  However, starting in early November, this number started to increase dramatically, exceeding 100,000 on some days.  Initially, this capital continued to pour into bitcoin, putting fuel on the short-term cycle and building new investor sentiment in favor of BTC.  BTC was going to $100,000, and by the time CNBC debuted its coveted ""BTC Ticker,"" the pendulum had swung too far in BTC's direction.  Larger investors started to take profits, bitcoin began to falter. It was time to find the next new shiny object…  As capital moved out of bitcoin and into other assets, we saw the end of one short-term cycle and beginning of the next. Starting in early December, a new cycle began and the ""cheaper"" Coinbase assets stole the show.  Capital that initially entered the crypto markets through BTC was finally comfortable with the crypto space and willing to move out on the risk curve. In other words, it was time to play with house money.  The newer retail entrants cared less about fundamental protocol strength and were easily lured into a protocol's marketing pitch. These were not cypherpunks.  BTC is archaic and overpriced to these investors. There is no EEA of bitcoin. No marketing team is pushing it. Why buy a $17,000 digital gold when you could buy a $100, faster alternative? In the first three weeks of December alone, litecoin increased 3.7x from $100 to $371 while BTC continued to lose ground.  LTC, too, would have a fall from grace when longer-term LTC holders began to sell (ahem Charlie) and returns started to stagnate. These restless investors moved on once again with more house money to play with. Their attention moved from the roulette table that is Coinbase to the craps table that is Bittrex, Poloniex and Binance. As a result, signups on those exchanges skyrocketed, and Bittrex even had to close new user accounts.  ""Holy shit, even cheaper versions of BTC."" Their marketing budgets lured them in with the siren call of lambos.  It seems ridiculous to say, but the cheaper the asset, the greater the chance of a return. And when I said cheap, I'm not referring to a fundamental measure of value like a value investor would (P/BV, P/E, etc). I'm referring to its price.  A chart of returns over the past seven days paints this picture. There's a direct negative correlation between the price of the token and return. It's scary, but it's unfortunately true.  TRX, XRP, XLM, ADA, you name it. ""Bitcoin 3.0."" Faster, cheaper and more upside. Right? It became a self-fulfilling prophecy. BTC retreated 40% and overall dominance fell from 65% down to 37% this week. The fire was already smoldering.  New retail investors were the gasoline. Preston Byrne said it best – cryptocurrencies have become the worlds largest penny stock casino.  Investors trying to find fundamental value are ripping their eyes out. XRP, with legitimately zero fundamental usage (see below), just passed BTC in diluted market cap.    Over the last day I’ve asked several people close to banks if banks are indeed planning to begin using Ripple’s token, XRP, in a serious way, which is what investors seem to assume when they buy in at the current XRP prices. This is a sampling of what I heard back: pic.twitter.com/zbfMqg4TpD        — Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) January 5, 2018      IOTA has proven cryptographic flaws. What the hell is TRON? RaiBlocks went from a market cap of $30 million to $4 billion in a week. What. The. Fuck.  Meanwhile, assets with real usage, actual code and strong development communities, like monero for example, have not moved. Are investors supposed to recognize the reality of the situation that, for the current market regime, fundamental protocol strength — adoption, code quality, tech talent, etc. — means less than the price of the asset and marketing budget.  Should you go all-in on coins less than $1? Or do you stick to your guns, find value and weather the shitcoin storm?  The answer comes down to understanding where we are the cryptocurrency cycle.  Where we are – and how to profit  The answer to investing is rarely black and white. It’s not ""get in"" or ""get out."" It's usually somewhere in the middle.  When people are increasingly willing to take risk and fear of missing out (FOMO) is prevailing over any sense of security and analytical discipline, that's the time to be worried. When the fundamentally weakest assets are rallying the most and people are proclaiming BTC is dead, we're starting to near the end of a short-term, altcoin-dominated cycle.  The problem is that investors tend to think of themselves as analytical, disciplined and contrarian, but the fact of the matter is that most tend to magnify cyclical moves. They cannot stomach the possibility they may miss out on gains.  That is why predicting the exact top and bottom is so challenging. But doing so with exact precision is not necessary…    Does anyone still talk about Bitcoin?        — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) January 5, 2018      Howard Marks describes the strategy well:  ""No one can ascertain when we’re at the exact top or bottom, a key to successful investing lies in selling – or lightening up – when we’re closer to the top, and buying — or, hopefully, loading up — when we’re closer to the bottom.""    Profiting from the short-term market cycles is not predicated on owning 0 bitcoin at peak alt and 0 alts at peak BTC. The key is that when investor euphoria is widespread, we should lighten up on those assets which are expensive and be more aggressive with those that are cheap. The time to be overweight alts is at the beginning and middle of the altcoin cycle. Not towards the end. And the same generally holds true for bitcoin.      It's about calibrating and balancing your allocation of capital in accordance with the current cycle and how aggressive or defensive you want to be.      Meanwhile, amid the small-cap and altcoin euphoria, we're on the precipice of a major entrance of institutional capital to the space and the one place it is going is BTC. Family offices, large hedge funds and endowments will not be investing in Bcash. A BTC ETF will launch sooner than people think. A TRON one will not.      To profit from these cycles, you need to first understand where we stand in it and then be able to act counter to it at the peaks and troughs. It's not easy. The only reason it's profitable is that because it's so hard. At first, you're bound to lose money as the cycle continues in its march to irrationality. But the cycle will always turn, and in crypto, we know it won't be long until it does.      Those with large altcoin positions should be worried. When the cycle reaches its peak and begins to turn, smaller-cap, illiquid tokens will fall as fast as they've gone up. Liquidity will dry up fast and you will not be able to sell anywhere close to the quoted price.      The market in altcoin terms is getting expensive and in BTC terms it's getting cheaper. It's time to start using altcoin gains to build up core, fundamentally strong positions.    A walk down memory lane  I'm not making this up. We've seen it happen before.  This period is eerily similar to March 2017. ""Bitcoin 2.0,"" ethereum, had recently launched on Coinbase, the EEA was getting cemented and a slew of conferences were created to promote etheruem. Why invest in digital gold when you could own a world computer?  For three months, ETH dramatically increased in price as new retail investors poured into the space and quit their jobs to day trade after massive gains. ETH increased in price from $7 in December of 2016 to $391 by June of 2017. BTC dominance fell from 86% to 40%. We were on the precipice of ""the flippening,"" after which many thought BTC would subsequently fall to zero.  Until the music stopped. Investors were tapped out. ICOs slowed down and ETH started having scaling issues just as the price got ahead of itself. Institutional capital began to enter BTC. The BTC dominance cycle began to revert.    Illiquid altcoins, some of the same ones the new retail investors have made their money from, fell dramatically. XVG fell from a peak of $0.006 down to $0.002, a 67% decline. XRP fell from $0.31 to $0.15, a 50% decline.    This year isn’t the first time it's happened. Investors have been lured out of bitcoin into altcoins since the first ones launched.  Since 2013, we’ve been seeing BTC dominance fall, only to regain most of the lost ground shortly thereafter. This cycle, too, will revert.  What causes each cycle?  Each aforementioned BTC cycle has a common thread: The investor base, partially driven by new capital, becomes enamored by an alternative asset or market narrative.  The cycle is usually triggered by a legitimate change in fundamentals. And then, subsequently, it's taken to the extreme by investor behavior. Earlier in 2017, it was smart contract functionality and ICOs. Now, as BTC fees creep up and ETH is facing scaling issues, most of the coins that have increased in price are aiming to be cheaper, faster or more scalable.  What we're actually seeing is a mini-Gartner hype cycle play out around a new market theme or narrative.  New technology captures investor attention. Emotional influences cause investors to follow the herd and fear of missing out predominates. The cycle gets taken to its extreme until it can go no further.    At one Point in the 1989 Japanese real estate bubble, the Imperial Palace in Japan was said to be worth more than the entire state of California,, things that don't make sense don't last....be careful out there        — Michael Novogratz (@novogratz) January 4, 2018      How to prepare for the next altcoin cycle    It goes without saying, but the current market regime is not fundamentally driven whatsoever, but is instead driven by narrative and investor sentiment.      The market is a Keynesian beauty contest. It's crucial to practice second-level thinking— the question isn't just why a protocol is interesting, but why and when the market will find it interesting.      The most profitable trades come from synthesizing views on the macro liquidity cycle, narrative and capital flows with micro-analysis into the crypto-economic tradeoffs and qualities of each protocol.      Towards the end of each short-term cycle, instead of doubling down on what's been working — i.e. doubling down on altcoins right now — prepare for the turn of the next.      When in a BTC cycle, the question to ask is: what narrative will be the crux of the next Gartner hype cycle? Where will the capital flow when the BTC cycle peaks, and what will be the catalyst?      Fundamentally analyze each protocol and determine which will benefit most from a shift in narrative. Do your diligence. Make sure the code and underlying infrastructure is sound and protect your capital.      When you inevitably find yourself thinking that BTC or [INSERT PROTOCOL HERE] can't be stopped, remember that we've been evolutionarily programmed to think pro-cyclically. It will be stopped. And the cycle will turn.

42428394,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL7gph,1515384026,Anti-Virus Token? Polyswarm Seeks Safer Internet With ICO,"There's never enough eyes out there looking for threats against internet users.  Take the recently disclosed Specter and Meltdown processor vulnerabilities, which showed how threats can linger for years undetected. Though as much as such giant engineering failures get attention, each of us is more likely to be hit by smaller threats, such as an email trick or an attachment loaded with malicious links.  But for Swarm Technologies, there is a lack of incentives for security experts to look as widely as they could.  Spinning out of the security firm Narf Industries, which recently completed a blockchain identity management project for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Swarm Technologies believes a crypto token could be a way to close gaps in software more quickly. As such, on Sunday night, the company announced that it will be running an initial coin offering (ICO) for the purpose of enlisting security researchers across the globe in creating a safer internet.  Proceeds raised during the $50 million token sale, which starts February 6, will initially go to building out a platform called PolySwarm, the hub where Swarm hopes security researchers will come together to work on what it calls ""micro-engines,"" specialized software built to scan documents, files and websites that might hide vulnerabilities.  It's becoming a common application of blockchains, this use of a limited data set to galvanize distributed communities toward goals. According to Bassi, Augur, the ethereum prediction market, was of particular inspiration, but while Augur harnesses the wisdom of the crowd to predict outcomes, PolySwarm wants only to incentivize experts.  But to understand the company's mission, it's helpful to understand how threat detection works today, where enterprise companies do scans to check for threats when web users do anything from click on a URL to open an email.  To do this more effectively, Swarm is looking to enlist enterprise IT teams and antivirus software companies that spot new files, new software, new documents that need to be scanned, to farm out those scans to a distributed network of researchers. Those researchers will build machines to do specific scans, and each time they do Swarm will reward the machines by sending them the token.  And in Bassi's mind, this use case will flip cryptocurrency’s role as it relates to security – from paying the ransom on encryption attacks to one that makes developing solutions for more niche areas of the internet viable.  Bassi told CoinDesk:  ""We’re basically trying to re-invent threat intelligence.""  Security nectar  Threat intelligence with added economics, is another way to put it.  Swarm's token, or ""nectar,"" will have a finite supply, 70 percent of which will be sold during the ICO. The company itself will keep 15 percent of the tokens, and the other 15 percent will be used to grow the network, including strategic allocations to potential security industry partners.  The company is capping the sale at $50 million, with a $5 million pre-sale. Down the road, Swarm envisions new business lines in assurance services, such as verification of security experts, analysis and insurance.  As an ERC-20 token riding on the ethereum blockchain, Bassi said smart contracts are at the core of what will make the offering succeed. The nectar tokens will be used to make all the payments on the platform, but those payments don't just flow from Swarm to the researchers. The system also requires micro-engines to stake an amount of nectar tokens on its assessment of the digital products it's scanning.  ""The tokens they have to put into their assertion also indicates their confidence in that assertion,"" Bassi told CoinDesk.  Every micro-engine (and in turn the researcher who built it) that makes the correct assessment gets a share of the fee paid for the scan, plus a share of any nectar that was staked by micro-engines that assessed the digital product incorrectly.  And according to Bassi, this mechanism of shared rewards incentivizes researchers to find niche areas to scan, where many other researchers might not be looking.  This is particularly novel in that today's anti-virus company structures incentivize chasing threats against the most widely used software, in an effort to attract the largest possible client base.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It provides more incentives to cover the minority populations that are getting hit hard with this stuff.""  And yet, Swarm isn't out to totally disrupt the incumbents, such as Norton and McAfee, in the space. Instead, Bassi said, those companies could serve as what PolySwarm calls ""ambassadors,"" actually managing the relationship with consumers while PolySwarm enables them to guard against more threat surface.  Blockchain critics  Yet, for some, adding a blockchain to this industry isn't going to solve the problems.  According to Jessy Irwin, a security consultant and an alum of AgileBits, the developer of one of the leading password managers 1Password: ""I don't see a clear or realistic incentive to adding a blockchain to this particular problem.""  Irwin continued, arguing that threat intelligence is already distributed and collaborative.  ""Malware hunters and researchers are very much widely distributed in many different kinds of organizations,"" she said. ""The people working on these issues are highly collaborative with one another while they are working on specific projects and campaigns.""  Yet, while Irwin is skeptical, other well-known security researchers seem to see value in the platform. Swarm's advisers on the project include Dan Guido, CEO of Trail of Bits, a security firm that’s a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, and Mark Tonnesen, whose done executive stints at Cisco and McAfee.  According to Bassi, ""A token is critical to that, because up until a few years ago, we didn’t have a way to move rewards across borders in sub-cent amounts without involving the global banking infrastructure.""  As Guido told CoinDesk, ""They're security engineers who found a new way to solve an old problem with blockchain technology. If another tool fit they job, then that's what they would be using.""  But Bassi's convinced that smart contracts are the right tool to get more eyes on threats:  ""It encourages the use of a utility token for a service that’s deeply needed.""
