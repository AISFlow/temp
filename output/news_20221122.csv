Compute North, one of the world's largest bitcoin mining firms, said in September that it couldn't fulfill debt obligations worth up to $500 million. Since then, its assets have been sold off to different entities, including its own lender, Generate Capital, which bought the company's stake in two mega-mining facilities for $5 million, earlier this month.  As part of the deal, Foundry will also have rights to completely build out and operate Compute North's facility in Minden, Neb. The deal will also include rights to a fleet of mining machines owned by the miner, as well as its intellectual property, the statement said.  ""It has been our mission to strengthen the infrastructure of digital assets by supporting mining companies through all market cycles,"" said Mike Colyer, CEO of Foundry, in the statement. ""Compute North has been our longtime partner and we are happy to have the opportunity to continue building upon the foundation they have laid over many years while growing the North American mining ecosystem.""

42411687,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfFFf,1669158242,What Are 'Fully Backed' Reserves?,"Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash.  This system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe.  Read More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?  After so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt?  Fully backed, explained  When a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth.  So, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run.  A stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token.  Fully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one.  This is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same.  But “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies.  Until October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.”  Read more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value  Some stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-are-fully-backed-reserves,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3677155a5685e43206cdcc290757cb1d4db22c26-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But is Bitcoin safe? Bitcoin is a speculative asset and not as decentralized as people think. This doesn't change the fact that Bitcoin is a form of money the world needs. Thesis Summary Following the demise of FTX ( FTT-USD ), Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) naysayers and maximalists alike have come out of the woodwork to attack/defend Bitcoin. On the one hand, some see the FTX collapse as proof that Bitcoin, and the broader crypto market, have become nothing but a giant Ponzi scheme. That despite all its advanced technology, Bitcoin is just a speculative investment On the other hand, there are those that see further proof of the need for Bitcoin following the FTX demise. After all, FTX was a centralized exchange, and Bitcoin aims to be a tool for decentralization. In a way, both camps are right, and both are wrong. How centralized is Bitcoin? One of the first words often used to describe Bitcoin is decentralization. The biggest draw of Bitcoin is that it is not controlled by anyone. Its supply is determined by immutable code, and it is purposefully designed to make its ownership accessible to anyone around the globe with an internet connection. But while Bitcoin is, theoretically, decentralized, in practice, a lot of power is concentrated in a few entities and small areas. Let's look at the key players in the Bitcoin ecosystem; miners, node providers and owners. Hashrate (Author's elaboration based on Luxor INdex) Now, as we can see in the chart above, one could argue that mining is currently a highly centralized market. The top 10 publicly traded crypto miners control 17.7% of the total Bitcoin hash rate. We can see that there is also a strong geographical concentration in the chart below: Hashrate by country (Statista) Here we have the Bitcoin hash rate by country, and we can see that over half of the hash rate is controlled by China and the United States combined. Now, let’s move on to Node distribution: Bitcoin nodes (Bitnodes) Once again, we see that nodes, which are in charge of updating the Bitcoin blockchain, are mostly concentrated in the USA and Europe. The chart also shows 53% of nodes in an undetermined location, but I think it is safe to assume that many could be coming from China. Lastly, we have to consider Bitcoin ownership. On-chain data can be very helpful in determining how Bitcoin is distributed amongst holders, but it has some problems. The issue is that a single address isn’t equivalent to a single person, and one person can have multiple addresses. Also, the opposite can be true, and multiple people’s funds could be stored in a single address (as is the case with exchanges). A Bloomberg report stated that 95% of the Bitcoin was controlled by only 2% of the addresses. However, this was disputed by Glassnode, which provided a much more thorough analysis of Bitcoin ownership, and found that, at most, the top 2% of network entities control 71.5% of supply. Ultimately, we have seen an increase in Bitcoin concentration, which can be attributed to the increased participation by institutions and large investors. So, is Bitcoin actually decentralized? That depends on what the meaning of this word is. In practical terms, a lot of the Bitcoin ecosystem is dominated by a handful of people/companies, but that doesn’t mean Bitcoin is centralized. The cryptocurrency still has very low barriers to entry for those wanting to mine or run a node, and using pools is an option. Also, the key issue here is that Bitcoin doesn’t rely on centralization for its success, but rather its centralization can be seen as a testament to its success. Bitcoin does not need large concentrations of wealth or effort to mine or run transactions, even if that is the case now. This means Bitcoin is still “anti-fragile”, as it won’t be susceptible to the collapse of an exchange like FTX, or even a mining ban like the one China enacted. Bitcoin Utility Now, with the demise of FTX and its token FTT, and the overall weakness in crypto, extreme bears are again coming out of the woodwork and predicting a total collapse. This is also a very far cry from the truth. While, indeed, I do see lower Bitcoin prices in the short term, there is no doubt in my mind that we are going back over all-time highs eventually. Those without the proper knowledge of Bitcoin fail to understand that Bitcoin is very different from the thousands of tokens that have been launched in the last 10 years. FTT was purposefully built to support the FTX ecosystem, so it is not surprising that both collapsed together. In a lot of ways, FTT tokens are just like FTX equity. But this is not the case with Bitcoin. This cryptocurrency has no company behind it, nor does it even have a known creator behind it. It was designed to operate for all intents and purposes like gold, and it is in many ways superior to gold . Bitcoin has a real use as a store of value, and this is proven by the fact that tiny nations like Nigeria are amongst the most crypto-curious in the world. For these people, Bitcoin offers actual utility as a store of value and a vehicle to transfer wealth. This concept may seem alien to us now, but the dollar is also subject to the same risks as every other fiat currency. Now, that is not to say that most of Bitcoin ownership today isn't speculative. This is undeniable, and it is supported by the charts laid out above. Most of the people holding Bitcoin today are doing so with the hopes of increasing their wealth in dollar terms. But like with the centralization argument, one thing doesn’t negate the other. The fact that Bitcoin is being bought up by speculators doesn’t take away from the fact that it holds the necessary properties to become accepted as a means of payment worldwide. It doesn’t take away from the fact that Bitcoin can replace and improve our current financial system. And it doesn't take away from the fact that in an increasingly fractured world, there is a need for a neutral form of money to emerge. Final Thoughts In conclusion, we must learn to distinguish between what Bitcoin is, or what it is perceived as, and what Bitcoin can be. Bitcoin is a speculative investment, and its price will fluctuate wildly in years to come. Fortunes will be made, and fortunes will be lost. The crypto space will see continued innovation but also more instances of fraud and collapse. The path to growth is not a straight line. But ultimately, time will prove that Bitcoin has a very important role to play in our financial and monetary system.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559976-both-wrong-about-bitcoin-lessons-from-ftx-collapse?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4656156.jpeg

His key concerns are the absence of KYC/AML processes and deposit outflows. Ultimately, I don't think these concerns make shorting Silvergate at $25/share a great risk/reward. There is a short thesis on Silvergate Capital ( SI ) by Marc Cohodes. Cohodes is well known as a determined short seller. Grant Williams interviewed him in a beautiful production for Real Vision. It’s a few years old, but it provides a view into Cohodes personality and background. There’s a lot of pressure on Silvergate Capital its share price that I suspect is, at least partly, due to an interview with Cohodes by Keith McCullough of HedgeEye. I understand the short case as I initially found myself on that side . After digging in deeper I now see the long side as a superior long term opportunity. In this interview, Cohodes says he’s short Silvergate Capital and insinuates several things are wrong at this bank. Because this interview seems to have a profound effect on the stock price and is widely cited in the comments on my previous articles, I’ll review the issues Cohodes brings up. My “reading” of Cohodes case is that he identifies the following problems: Cohodes: Know your customer and anti-money laundering at Silvergate Capital is potentially not in order He provides no evidence for this claim, except that Silvergate held $1 billion of FTX in deposits and he seems to believe FTX is a criminal organization. Silvergate deals with a limited number of institutional grade customers. These are trading firms, mining firms, exchanges, hedge funds, etc. It is easier to do extensive customer diligence on business customers. However, your customers can still lie on the forms you provide them. If they're a total fraud, they're not going to announce this during a KYC or AML process. At this time, I don’t see a reason why Silvergate should be considered especially lax. Silvergate was one of the first banks to provide services to crypto-related customers, and if they weren't under intense scrutiny they likely were prepared to be pioneers in this field. The most recent investor presentation has this slide clearly showing the presence of KYC and AML procedures : Silvergate Capital Compliance and Risk framework (Silvergate Capital Investor Presentation) Cohodes: Silvergate processes an abnormal volume of USD transactions, given its deposit base Silvergate pays no interest on deposits. It encourages clients to take the deposits they are not engaging in trades elsewhere to earn yield. The network they have developed is very valuable to trading firms and exchanges in the ecosystem because they can do dollar trades with other Silvergate customers at no cost. They can send each other crypto elsewhere and settle the corresponding dollar amounts on Silvergate, for example. Silvergate is popular with hedge and arb funds that can easily send money between exchanges or go in and out of crypto exposure. What customers are looking for is an efficient use of their capital base, and Silvergate is seeking to provide that platform. Efficient use of capital means high trading volumes. It makes sense that there is a lot of volume at Silvergate on a relatively modest deposit base. These are not your run-of-the-mill bank deposits. It is effectively day trading capital. A bank analyst Cohodes knows says there is a run on the bank going on. Cohodes is likely referring to Porter Collins or @Seawolfcap on Twitter. Porter Collins posted the following on Twitter: Porter Collins tweet (Twitter) Cohodes states it is a deposit story implying it is not a solvability story (although he doesn’t say that outright). A deposit story isn’t as interesting at a bank like Silvergate as it would be at your run-of-the-mill sleepy town bank. At most banks deposits are hard to win and if you lose them, they're hard to get back. There isn't much difference between most banks. But Silvergate's services are deeply differentiated and customized around the needs of their crypto industry clientele. It seems much likely to me that deposits that are temporarily scared off, will return. Deposits have historically been quite volatile because of their specific nature (mostly crypto firms and crypto trading firms). In turn, Silvergate its assets are highly liquid and designed to meet a high number of rapid withdrawals 24/7. Deposits seem extra likely to return because the environment to capture spreads in crypto markets is good (high volatility). Silvergate provides valuable infrastructure advantages if you trade in that arena. It doesn't mean they aren't losing deposits right now, but naturally, it should be a temporary headwind as funds will want to pursue opportunities. Deposit base I find some solace in the fact that Silvergate’s deposit base is highly institutional-based with clients with a lot of knowledge about this space. In addition, the deposits are not based on any yield differential. They deposit with Silvergate DESPITE the zero yield on deposits. This confirms customers are attracted to the platform for other reasons. One of these things is the trading advantages, and it is exactly in this type of environment that trading is very lucrative. Do you want to pull back from trading just as the going is very, very good? That doesn't seem very likely to me. I believe historically deposits at Silvergate tended to RISE as volatility in crypto goes up. Deposit history Silvergate (Special Situations Report ) But the deposits also rise with the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) as trading the same number of Bitcoins requires an increasing number of dollars when its price is rising sharply: Data by YCharts Silvergate is generally reporting an AVERAGE quarterly deposit number (which has been its practice for many quarters now). They believe this is more informative because the firm sometimes experiences multi-billion dollar swings of deposits within days. As an investor, the average is hard to read because there are different ways the number may have come together. One of the worst-case scenarios is where crypto firms fled to safety in the FTX crisis (i.e. parked at Silvergate), and after Cohodes started throwing shade at the bank there may have been a stampede away (as this is only a few days ago). The average could still be holding up very well while deposits could theoretically be much lower. The opposite is also possible where everyone initially battened down the hatches and are now returning to do a lot of trading as the opportunities to do arbitrage and scalping are likely really good amidst the chaos. I've also charted the trading volume over SEN going back to Q1 2020 and a picture like this emerges (based on the Q3.5 update as of yesterday): SEN Volume history (Special Situations Report) There is a lot of trading volume, but it is not entirely exceptional. There have been quite a few peaks of the trading volume. Likely the volume is easier to achieve with much higher Bitcoin and crypto prices so it could still be exceptional if adjusted for that. My understanding from going through years of earnings calls is that there is a relationship where deposits tend to be high when volumes are high, BUT this relationship doesn't hold 1:1 and last week's deposit update suggests it doesn't hold true right now. Conclusion I can't say I'm not worried about the short-selling campaign that's casting doubt on the company and potentially driving some deposit outflows. However, I think there are three important mitigating factors: 1) The deposit base is professional in nature 2) Trading opportunities are likely really good and to traders, Silvergate is a huge help 3) To a ""normal bank"" deposit outflows are long-term damaging. I don't think that's the case here. Silvergate's SEN network has a lot of utility to its customers (that's why they go along with receiving no yield) and they will come back if they are no longer scared.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559973-silvergate-capital-why-short-case-doesnt-make-sense?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4655968.jpeg

Fall of perceived ""safe"" company will prompt flood of withdrawals from other brokerages. Institutional investors will flee crypto until new regulations are in place. Only a small minority of crypto assets will survive, Bitcoin leading the pack. Surviving crypto assets will need to demonstrate real world benefits. The Crisis Unfolds This last week has seen a series of seminal events that have rocked the crypto world and shaken it to its foundations. Crypto bears are already announcing the death knell of all cryptocurrencies. What happened? FTX (FTT-USD), one of the world's largest global crypto brokerages, effectively went bankrupt over the course of a week. FTX.US, its SEC-regulated branch that had been approved by US government regulators, also declared bankruptcy, a few days later, on November 23, 2022. In just a week, Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year old CEO of the company, went from a hero glossing the cover pages of Fortune Magazine to competing for the ranks of the most vilified person in the crypto finance. Fortune questioned whether the young mogul would not be ""The Next Buffett?"" and made him famous enough to be identified by his initials :SBF. Just 1 year later, the same reporter was labeling SBF as the ""so-called genius"", and cited scathing attacks on SBF such as the one posted in the Daily Mail by Maureen Callahan: ""I never could work out what crypto is. Now a weird outfit run by an insufferable kid with a hoodie has lost billions ... and it's proof 'smart people' didn't have a clue either. "" After stepping down from his position as CEO, Bankman-Fried in a series of posts to his Twitter followers, took personal responsibility: ""I'm sorry"" and ""I [messed] up"". SBF admits responsibility (twitter.com) In a series of subsequent postings on November 16, 2023 , again on Twitter, SBF, painted the following picture: sbf (twitter.com) sbf (twitter.com) A new CEO, John Ray III, was appointed by the bankruptcy court to oversee the US firms unwinding. Ray had previously overseen of scandal-plagued energy firm Enron following its collapse in 2001. After even a few days of review of the FTX books and records, Ray blasted the management - or rather lack thereof - of the FTX business in his first reporting to the bankruptcy court. ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" Ray wrote. ""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented,"" he summarized. What's The Damage And What Caused It? In less than a week FTX went from an approximate market value of $40 billion to an unknown sum. It will take weeks and months to determine the extent of the damage. A detailed analysis of all that transpired is beyond the scope of this article. Bottom line, the FTX management appears to have used customer assets to lend money to a closely related company, Alameda Research. Alameda was owned by SBF. FTX lending custodial money without customer permission was in direct violation of FTX written customer policies. Alameda in turn risked all the money in a series of ill-conceived crypto trades, according to SBF. However, the bankruptcy documents also show that Alameda, owned by SBF, made $4.1 billion in loans to related parties, including $1 billion to SBF himself, as revealed in the recent bankruptcy filings The money is gone, whether to poor trading or nefarious practices remains to be determined. But the repercussions are even larger. In order to save his collapsing empire, the ambitious SBF lent money by the hundred of millions to numerous other floundering crypto businesses. Seen by the industry as its savior and compared to the likes of J.P.Morgan in saving the bank industry from collapse, SBF now appears to have been the industry's greatest Achilles heel. Greed and Politics? Did They Mix? SBF was the Democrat's party's second largest donor in the recent elections, donating around $40 million dollars to top Democratic candidates. He contributed to both Republican and Democrat senators who were co-sponsors of a proposed bill to revamp crypto regulations. SBF was so highly reputed as a crypto genius that he became the go-to man advising Congress on how to enact new regulations to saveguard the crypto industry from scammers and bank runs. It is critical for crypto investors to understand the political maelstrom surrounding the FTX bankruptcy, and how that is likely to impact investments in the sector going forward. On March 23, some eight months before Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire collapsed, SEC Chairman Gensler granted what some crypto players are calling an unusual meeting to the then-billionaire SBF. The details of that meeting are not a matter of public record. But according to Republican critics , they discussed an idea for a new SEC-approved crypto trading platform. Prominent House member Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) tweeted recently that “@GaryGensler runs to the media while reports to my office allege he was helping SBF and FTX work on legal loopholes to obtain a regulatory monopoly.” Republican critics also cite inappropriate close personal links to SEC Chairman Gensler, who after all was the top US official in charge of regulation of the crypto space. They claim that Gensler consulted with SBF personally in devising his plan to regulate crypto. They allege that this inappropriately aided the budding billionaire in fashioning his growing empire in such a way as to avoid the clutches of regulators and curry advantage over competitors. Now that Republicans have won a narrow victory in the House, I expect they will exploit this explosive issue to build their case against Democrats in the upcoming 2024 presidential elections. It's possible that the political furor will fade into the background as time passes and these events will have little impact on investors willing to enter the risky crypto space. But I think the opposite. Already the issue is beginning to gather steam. According to Coin Telegraph, a leading crypto blog, a recent petition for review by Congress had gathered 4000 signatures and stated: “Evidence has emerged that proves that Gensler met with [FTX CEO] Sam Bankman-Fried, before the $14 billion collapse of FTX. Members of Congress have already been informed that Gensler was working with Bankman-Fried to give FTX a regulatory free pass while a massive fraud was going on right under the SEC’s nose. […] It’s time for a full Congressional investigation of Gensler’s role in one of the biggest financial frauds in American history.” Democrats are likely to point out that SBF left the meeting empty-handed. Since then, Gensler has been the main proponent of clamping down on the crypto industry to prevent the kind of calamity that just occurred. True to form, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was quick to formulate the Democrat line in a recent tweet . ""The collapse of one of the largest crypto platforms shows how much of the industry appears to be smoke and mirrors. We need more aggressive enforcement, and I'm going to keep pushing to enforce the law to protect consumers and financial stability."" Which version is right? Are Republicans right in pointing to corruption in high places, gross administrative negligence by Democrat appointees, and nepotistic policies at the highest levels of power? Or Democrats in pointing the the dangers of too loose regulations and a lack of government oversight? Time will tell. But for the astute investor, in my opinion, one thing is certain: this issue will become a major focus of the upcoming elections, and incite more and more political acrimony. This in turn will have an immediate effect on the crypto investment space: until the controversy surrounding FTX is hashed out politically, there will be a freezing of new crypto ventures. Thinly-capitalized ventures will find new capital impossible to raise, and will be forced to shut down. The Domino Effect According to the bankruptcy filings, FTX had control over a mind-bending 130 closely held entities. Moreover, FTX had investments in dozens on non-related companies (Genesis, Gemini, CoinDesk) and large stakes in important crypto currencies like Solana and Serum. Any unloading of these assets by the bankruptcy administrator could have deleterious effects on prices. A list of major investors in FTX read like the ""Who's Who"" of the crypto world: names like Binance, Multicoin, Sequoia Capital, Temasek, Paradigm, Pantera Capital. In the tightly intertwined world of crypto, one company's debts are inevitably another company's assets. Due to the enormous leverage deployed within the crypto world and especially in the defi space and the offshore crypto brokerages, the impact of a $20-40 billion loss could end up causing losses many multiples of that. Crypto investors worldwide are being barraged by a mind-numbing series of announcements that has them bewildered and shocked. The risk is that they will throw out good investments along with the bad, causing a collapse of otherwise healthy companies and a failure of promising, world-changing ventures. For example, in the few days I've spent writing this article, SOL has lost another 25% of its value and I give it a big chance of going to zero. This could happen in just weeks, not months. SOL in turn, is at the anchor of many other crypto ventures. What crypto whales, hedge funds, or other institutions have lost big on their SOL investments, which may lead them to fail or reduce their exposure elsewhere? Less than a year ago the Crypto market had grown to just shy of $2.8 trillion in market cap by November 2021. Today, this had dropped to $833 billion. Crypto Market Cap Nov '22 (coinmarketcap.com) A drop by another half again would not be surprising. Is Crypto Dying? If the crypto industry is not dying, it's certainly on life support. Following this bankruptcy, many crypto sceptics have reiterated their proclamations that all cryptos, including the original crypto, Bitcoin, would go to zero. Before we address those critics, it is important and necessary to point out one fact that is the veritable ""raison d'etre"" behind crypto: the problems of fiat currencies. In all of human history, every single government run currency - dubbed ""fiat"" currency - has gone to zero value over time. There are no exceptions, given a long enough time span. The dollar is well on its way to doing the same. The Ever Shrinking Dollar ( shtfplan.com ) Nor is this trend changing. In fact, it is accelerating. With inflation at around 8% and interest rates at around 4%, the dollar is currently losing around 4% a year. At that rate, it will have lost another 50% of its value in 13 years. That to me is a certainty, given the impossible amounts of de`bt affecting the US government today, at over $30 trillion, with unfunded obligations of over $172 trillion dollars. Those unfunded obligations are not trivial items, easily discarded, unless you don't need Medicare or Social Security. So to me the choice is clear. An investor can choose between losing between 3% and 10% a year to inflation for certain , or purchasing an asset that is certain to fluctuate widely in value today, but could be worth 5 to 10 times more over the next decade. Buying cryptos is like buying a very very long term deep out of the money call option with a 10 year expiry. Known downside, unlimited upside. Think recent inflation is just a temporary phenomenon of money printing due to Covid? Take a good look at the chart below, showing that inflation has eclipsed the return of all other traditional investments, such as real estate, gold, stocks or treasuries over the last 20 years . The pink line leading the chase is the Consumer Price index. Right behind it in the race - far surpassing any other investments - is the blue line depicting M2. M2 is the Federal Reserve's measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily-convertible near money. Inflation has historicall eclipsed all other investments (stockcharts.com) Maybe you are convinced that despite the indebtedness of the US and e very other major economy of the world, somehow , miraculously the central banks will permanently reverse the money printing machines. Governments will live within their means and balance all budgets. I wish you were right. But I'd rather take the other side of that bet. Now that I've explained why ""cash is trash"" for any kind of long term savings plan, let's look at crypto itself. After all, if crypto itself is just another hair-brained asset bubble like the Dutch Tulip mania, then the lesser evils could be traditional investments, even if these don't keep up with inflation. There Are Cryptocurrencies - And Then There Is Bitcoin You know the slogan ""its not worth the paper they are printed on""? Well, cryptos are not printed. They are digital bits. They are , so to speak, in another dimension. So are cryptos worthless, just because you can't rub them between your fingers? Well you can't do that with the internet either, but I'd argue the latter has enormous value. What about other intangibles, like thoughts, stories, ideas or heck, even God? All intangible, therefore worthless? You get my point. In order to respond to the critics of cryptocurrencies, we must make an important distinction between inflationary and non-inflationary cryptos. Bitcoin - Different From The Rest Bitcoin enthusiasts become downright angry when you lump Bitcoin in with other cryptocurrencies. All those other currencies, they argue are subject to the same weaknesses as fiat currencies. They are either non-deflationary - and thus subject to the same weakening of real buying power over time. Or they are deflationary, but suffer from too small market caps or too much centralization by a handful of powerful interests. Other coins, such as Litecoin, are built similarly to Bitcoin and benefit from similar proof-of-work mechanisms and maximum emission caps. But Litecoin, and numerous other Bitcoin imitations, all suffer from the same problem. They are not the first born, benefitting from an already wide user base with a huge recognition factor. Because Bitcoin had an advantage of time, born in 2008, it reached critical size much earlier than other anti-inflationary coins. Cryptocurrencies, by their social nature, are subject to the growth metrics defined by Metcalf's Law. Metcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system. So the larger a network already is, the easier it is to grow even faster. When you are talking about something to be used as a means of exchange, like a cryptocurrency, you'd rather own one that is the most used by other people. You'd think twice about paying anything for a cryptocurrency - as brilliant as it may appear to have been conceived - if there are only 2 other using it. At 200 users, you be far more likely, and at 2 million users you'd be much more motivated. Take a gander at Bitcoins usage numbers: it's continued going parabolic in the last 2 years since this graph was published. Bitcoin Unique User Statistics (glassnode) Since Bitcoin, then, is in my view the King of Cryptos, different from all the rest, let's consider arguments made by its most ardent critics. One of the best critiques I've found of cryptos is that of Nassim Taleb, who claims that Bitcoin is essentially a Ponzi scheme that will go to zero. I have tremendous respect for Taleb, an out-of-the-box thinker who is always happy to prove that the king has no clothes. While Taleb raises a number of valid points, I disagree with his conclusions. For a detailed rebuttal, see this article . In a nutshell, here's why I disagree: Like gold, Bitcoin only has value because many people have chosen to give it value. In both cases, that supposedly ""intrinsic"" value is purely based on the fact that other people cherish it. If there are enough people who do so, that value is ""real"". Nor can Bitcoin simply be copied by another named, identical protocol, as Taleb claims. This could indeed make it lose its anti-inflationary appeal. If you can only ever have 21 million Bitcoins issued, but you can issue unlimited new versions of Bitcoin, each holding 21 million coins, then you effectively have no cap, right? That would be no different than fiat money. But that argument is false, because those other copied Bitcoins would never gain the same traction. How many Mona Lisa's are you going to buy? Because in the same way that no other search engine protocol could overtake Google once the latter reached a certain size, the same applies to Bitcoin. The more people adopt Bitcoin, the more vendors will want to accept it. The more people use it, the more other people will hear about it. The more vendors adopt it, the more new people will want to use it for savings and transactions. This is the nature of Metcalf's law. Even for those who argue that Bitcoin is not a good transactional currency, but only a means of storing value over time (like valuable artwork), this argument holds true. Where would you rather store your savings? In something valued by 10 million users, or 200 million? Moreover, with the growth of the Lightning network, which uses Bitcoin as its base reference, Bitcoin is now quickly becoming an extremely powerful transactional currency, one in which it costs less than 1 penny to send money around the world. Bitcoin enjoys four advantages that gold does not: 1) it is not as easily subject to forfeiture or seizure, 2) it is far more difficult to forge 3) it has far lower storage costs and 4) it has orders of magnitude lower transaction costs. As for reaching minimum adoption, this has long since been eclipsed, as the aforementioned graph showed. Bitcoin, in my view, has long since reached its ""takeoff"" network stage. If you own Bitcoin, you will always - and easily - find someone willing to buy it off of you. It may be a lot more or a lot less than what you've paid for it, but you'll always find an immediate buyer. Bitcoin, by the very nature of how its protocol was fashioned, is an anti-inflationary money. There will never be more than 21 million units printed, and we are at over 19 million units already circulating. This means that with network effects - it is extremely likely to gain enormously in value as more and more people globally become aware of its existence and how to use it. I definitely believe there will be an enormous slowdown in adoption of Bitcoin as a result of the FTX collapse. New users will be scared off. Existing users may have lost too much money in other cryptocoins to buy more Bitcoin. But just as happened in earlier scams and crises, just like that of Mount Gox in 2013, Bitcoin will emerge from it more strong, and much more famous. Eventually, more and more people will realize why Bitcoin's decentralized, censorship-resistant nature makes it the perfect antidote not only for weakening central currencies and privacy-robbing CBDC's, but also for the dangers of non-custodial solutions. When the get-rich schemes lose their luster - and believe me they will - those cryptos that provide real value will gain renewed adherents. Separating The Wheat from The Chaff In January of this year, there were over 21,000 cryptocurrencies, with 1000 new ones being born each month. I've always believed that 98% of these would collapse to zero. But that 2% that don't will eventually grow to become the most important sector of the global economy. FTX' collapse and the scandal, will kill off the majority of those cryptocurrencies, but allow the few crypto survivors to flourish. Like a forest fire. That fire, so destructive and so frightening, clears out dead and diseased trees, decaying leaves, and other unhelpful vegetation. That permits new plants to grow. Immediate Ramifications Of The FTX Crisis So if most of the cryptos will perish in this crisis, but some thrive, how can you as an investor cope? Here are some of the ramifications I foresee. This crisis will cement the views of many private investors who were tempted to dip their toes into the crypto world to avoid the sector like the plague. Institutional investors will shelve any plans to get involved. Died-in-the-wool crypto investors will favor hodling strategies in only the strongest of cryptos (BTC, ETH) and will abandon altcoins in droves. Any centrally controlled crypto exchanges (CEX's) will either submit to legislative controls or go bankrupt. Decentralized Exchanges protocols driven by software that are outside of government controls will ironically suffer. This should not be the case - after all the software that governs them is visible to anybody who can read the code. If the code is changed that is immediately transparent to all as it involves public discussions and acceptance by a majority of stakers or users. However, 99% of investors and their advisors cannot read code. And even the most sophisticated users find the defi protocols complex clunky, and subject to breakdowns. Most CEX's will prohibit or limit margin trading. Already in the last 6 months it has become impossible to short crypto stocks on any of the major US CEX's. Talking to Kraken yesterday, I was told I would need to have at least $10 million in my account to do so. (Sorry I'm a bit shy of that right now...) Until the FTX issue is completely settled, investors will throw out the baby with the bathwater. They'll scramble to save whatever crypto assets they have left. This means a big drop in all crypto values. ,This process will take months to occur. Even the strongest CEX's will suffer huge operating losses. Bigger, more regulated exchanges like Coinbase ( COIN ) , Binance or Kraken will be able to swallow and absorb the hundreds of smaller, lesser known, or more poorly financed competitors,. Ultimately, they will likely gain in market share. But even those large CEX's will face enormous challenges just to survive. COIN derives about 90% of its income from trading. Yet bullish crypto investors have gone into full hodling, or dollar-cost-averaging mode. Those (like myself) who would profit by trading to the downside are effectively prohibited from doing so on those exchanges. And exchanges that permit this are off limits to US investors. Similarly, the crypto mining industry will take a big hit. Miners will face much lower asset revenues , forcing them to sell more of the the crypto they produce in order to stay in business, even if they are long term believers. ""Not your keys, you your crypto"" has gained a whole new level of awareness. Those investors not abandoning crypto altogether will learn how to deal with the complexity of hardware wallets and the virtue of self-custody. The last domino has not fallen. FTX allegedly had controlling interests in over 180 different entities. It was a major investor in countless other exchanges and protocols, and tokens. I expect at least 2 or 3 other huge bankruptcies before this is over. (Since I started writing this two more have fallen, Japan's largest crypto brokerage and Gemini have both announced they are freezing customer withdrawals.) Solana, the 8th largest cryptocurrency by assets just a month ago, had deep links to FTX. It's seen its asset values drop by over 67%, with a loss of value of market cap of over $5 billion at time of writing. This currency had been believed by many to be about to dethrone Ethereum (ETH) as the central currency of the Defi world. Now, it is fighting for survival. Central governments, spurred on by The World Economic Forum will capitalize on this crisis to advance their Central Bank Digital Currencies, at the expense of stablecoins like Tether, DAI, or USDC. While most institutions will flee crypto, the most savvy institutions will take quiet measures over the next year or so to buy into the most promising crypto sectors at bargain basement prices. What Makes A Good Crypto? For the investor, then, it is extremely important to know how to recognize the small minority of good crypto investments from the overwhelming majority of losers We talked above about the advantages of proof of work (""POW"") cryptos like Bitcoin. These derive their value from the real cost of the electricity needed to generate new coins, the size of their network, the robustness of their security schemes, and their inflationary/deflationary nature. But what of proof-of-stake (""POS"") cryptos that have become much more popular recently, with Ethereum leading the pack? A POS crypto is one that derives its security not from the difficulty and cost and decentralized nature of the miners involved in new coinage production. A POS crypto assures its security by locking a certain amount of capital in the crypto that those holders may not sell over a specified period of time. These users, because they have stake in the outcome, are called stakers. If the crypto asset is hacked or data is fraudulently manipulated, those crypto stakers lose a portion of their holdings commensurate to those losses or manipulations. In exchange for taking this risk, the stakers receive a guaranteed return on their investment as well as operational and voting controls over governance of the cryptocurrency. The advantages of POS over POW is that the former is far less expensive to run and consequently can be orders of magnitude faster. The disadvantage is that POS ultimately tend to suffer from centralization, giving too much power to a small number of individuals or institutions. There are a number of solutions - some good , some bad - for dealing with those issues. Both POW and POS can be viable mechanisms. Whether a coin has value is ultimately, in my opinion, one one fact. Does it have a utility that is linked to something of value in the real world, like the growth in goods and services? Does the crypto serve a need that cannot be better addressed by existing web2 technologies and centralized industries? Is the crypto asset managed by a group or team of highly-motivated and highly qualified individuals with a demonstrated ability to manage the project? If you find a crypto asset that responds positively to those three questions, you've got a winner. For Bitcoin - The Utility is Long Term Value Growth Bitcoin serves the purpose of a long term anti-inflationary instrument. Yes its volatile, though that volatility is projected to go down over time. But at least the volatility is rewarded with enormous growth. Unlike savings accounts. For those who don't like the volatility, just mix and match: It is one asset class, among others, and should best be mixed with other asset classes to produce desired results. Bitcoin vs main asset classes (stockcharts.com) For example, if you really want to play it safe, put 90% of your assets in short term government bonds (no duration risk), and the balance split evenly between Bitcoin, Gold, real estate, stocks and commodities. You'll be amazed at how well you sleep at night, and how much you outperform a savings account. Form more on similar strategies, see a recent posting of mine. But in the crypto world, it's not just Bitcoin that will thrive. Nor is Bitcoin the best solution for matching other real-world needs. Real-World Practicality Vs Ill-Conceived Utopias As mentioned, 98% of the cryptos I've looked at fail the test of real world practicality. Here's how they work. Crypto entrepreneurs essentially create a token out of thin air. They trade it avidly among a group of friends and insiders to build up interest in the token, bidding the price up artificially. This is their intent. When they've reached a critical mass of price, volume and attention, they sell it to the masses, allocating themselves a healthy number of free shares for their efforts. But wait, isn't that what stocks also do in an IPO? You're right. The difference is, in almost all cases the stocks are tied to an existing business with a proven track record, or to a new business idea that is carefully drafted so that investors understand how the idea could make money in the real world. Check out the majority of cryptos. They are self-referential. Here's how the John Sindreu of the WSJ summed it up in a Nov 17,2022 commentary : ""All of crypto is a deeply interconnected ecosystem in which assets are created without relation to real-world wealth and then used as collateral to further inflate what boils down to a single, enormous credit risk - crypto itself."" That's a scathing indictment of the crypto industry. Unfortunately, its true of 98% of the companies involved. But not all of them. It reminds me of the things I used to hear about web technologies after the 2000 dot-com crash. Some crypto tokens perform a real world purpose unmatched by traditional technologies. File sharing is one of them, I would propose. Yes Google and AWS do this brilliantly, but at an enormous cost to our privacy and ultimately our independence from governments and powerful interests. Social networking is another. The recent political and social upheaval surrounding Meta's Facebook, Twitter, Apple's I-Store and TikTok, just to name a few, are indicative of the problems and perils of centralization in the web2 world we've constructed in the last 20 years. There are many others where the benefits of the blockchain. The financial democratizing incentives of cryptos can create a powerful new force creating unimaginable new efficiencies that benefit humanity. Crypto can enable this process to occur in a manner that is more equitable to the common man, more diversified across geographies, and more efficient in its outcomes. The trick is to separate the wheat from the chaff. It's not an easy task. It takes research, time and a lot of hard thinking. Seeking Alpha pages are a great place to do that. Crypto Tamed Or Defi Discovered? It will take at least a year or two for the political dust to settle out and all of the revelations from this crisis to become clear. Once that occurs, there are two ways this could play out in the longer run, for the crypto industry. On the one hand, it could strengthen the hands of centrally-managed, strictly regulated central crypto exchanges. These organizations could have to closely follow US policies of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulations. They will be placed under intense financial scrutiny and subject to expensive, tedious reporting that favors only the largest institutions. International companies like Binance - the world's largest crypto brokerage - would have to bow to political pressures and succumb to US regulatory scrutiny. If this occurs, I expect you will find little difference between these companies and traditional stock brokerages, large public companies like Schwab ( SCHW ) or Interactive Brokers ( IBKR ). In fact, I believe you will see an absorption of crypto brokerages by big brokerage companies, and smaller traditional brokerages by big crypto brokerages. On the other hand, the critics of government regulation could win out. They could convince the US and global electorates that the FTX fiasco was caused or enabled by government ineffective controls. They argue that the calamities of the FTX disaster reveal the dangers of centralized control. Government controls, they argue, give you the appearance of safety, without the ability to enforce such safety. Moreover, government regulations prove to be so stifling that they prevent truly novel ideas and newer, more efficient modern technologies to flourish. There are elements of truth to both sides, I believe. The stronger political force will be the one for calling for more government regulations and rules and more centralized controls. Eventually, the pendulum will swing back to more decentralization, but this will take years, not months. Attempted regulations will prove ineffective or counterproductive. Innovation will dry up. Meanwhile, true believers among the crypto-engineers will devolve better solutions to enhance transparency, improve privacy, and remove the complexity from defi protocols. With better understanding of defi code functionality, and independent third party controls of protocols, investors will be better placed to judge the risks and rewards of each crypto investment. One thing is certain. SBF will have left a permanent mark on the world of crypto. We don't know how he would have liked to have left his legacy, but undoubtedly, the world of crypto will never be the same.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559970-ftx-and-the-crypto-reset?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4655544.jpeg
42413598,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA2wm,1669156926,"Market Wrap: FTX Was Sam Bankman-Fried’s 'Personal Fiefdom,' Lawyers Said","FTX lawyers at the company’s first bankruptcy hearing in Delaware detailed its “abrupt and difficult” collapse within the course of two weeks – shortly after CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported that Alameda Research, a sister company of the FTX crypto exchange, held an unexpectedly large amount of FTT tokens issued by FTX itself.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  “You have witnessed probably one of the most abrupt and difficult collapses in the history of corporate America,” James Bromley of Sullivan and Cromwell, an attorney representing FTX, explained during the company’s first bankruptcy hearing.  Bromley described the FTX empire – at its height valued at $32 billion – as the “personal fiefdom of Sam Bankman-Fried,” the former CEO of the exchange.  When Bankman-Fried reluctantly relinquished his position to FTX’s new CEO, former Enron cleanup man John Jay Ray III, it allowed those left at the company to, “for the first time, really see under the covers and recognize that the emperor had no clothes,” according to Bromley.  Though Bromley did not identify Bankman-Fried by name, he told the court that FTX “was in the control of a small group of inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals, and unfortunately, the evidence seems to indicate that some or all of them are also compromised individuals.”  There are over 100 different debtors tied to the FTX group that filed for bankruptcy, another attorney said.  Other News  Bitcoin (BTC) regained the $16,000 level Tuesday, coinciding with the news that Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management bought $1.5 million in Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up 2.4% to $16,100 – after hitting a two-year low of $15,480 Monday. Despite Tuesday’s gain, Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, told CoinDesk that as the market is “in digestion,” it’s possible to see BTC drop further – possibly to the $12,500 level before the end of the year.  Several altcoins also had a strong performance: Ether (ETH) followed a similar trajectory as BTC, and was up roughly 2.6% to $1,120. Solana’s SOL token was up 3% to nearly $12. CRV, the governance token of decentralized exchange Curve, was the top performer of the day among the basket of digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index as the token jumped over 25%, reversing its sharp drop earlier in the day.  Equity markets across the board turned green: U.S. stocks edged up ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, with the Standard and Poor's 500 Index up 1.3% at closing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) gained 1.1%, while Nasdaq was up 1.3%.

The token dropped 17% to a two-year low of 40 cents early Tuesday before erasing the losses with a V-shaped recovery.  Saudi Arabia’s non-fungible token (NFT) collection soared after an unexpected soccer win against Argentina in the FIFA World Cup.Sales for the Saudi Arabia-themed NFT collection called “The Saudis” increased 387% on Tuesday. Argentina’s fan token, in contrast, dropped 21% over the past 24 hours and was trading at $5.44 at the time of publication.

Moreover, SBF Bankman-Fried along with a small group of executives led FTX, which was once valued to the tune of $32B, “with a lack of corporate controls that none of us in the profession … have ever seen,” the attorney told the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware, as reported by CoinDesk. Bromley said there was evidence that ""seems to indicate that some or all of them are also compromised individuals,” adding that a big portion of FTX's assets may have been stolen or went missing. In reference to SBF treating his crypto empire as his own ""personal fiefdom,"" one of FTX's U.S. affiliates spent around $300M of customer funds on Bahamas-located real estate for the company's leadership team, he noted. As details about the corruption behind FTX's leadership prior to its implosion continue to unfold, SBF, who stepped down as FTX CEO on November 11, apologized to the exchange's employees, saying ""I didn't mean for any of this to happen, and I would give anything to be able to go back and do things over again. You were my family,"" he wrote in an internal letter viewed by CoinDesk. ""I've lost that, and our old home is an empty warehouse of monitors. When I turn around, there's no one left to talk to."" SBF said a shortage in credit across the crypto space triggered a more than 50% decline in the value of FTX's collateral and a 4x jump in its liabilities. Prior to those moves in the spring, the company's collateral stood at around $60B and its liabilities were $2B. But then another market downturn occurred in November, which ""led to another roughly 50% reduction in the value of collateral over a very short period of time,"" SBF said, as quoted by CoinDesk. ""As we frantically put everything together, it became clear that the position was larger than its display on admin/users, because of old fiat deposits before FTX had bank accounts,"" he explained. ""I did not realize the full extent of the margin position, nor did I realize the magnitude of the risk posed by a hyper-correlated crash."" Previously, (Nov. 17) John J.

In the letter, shared internally in FTX's company Slack and obtained by CoinDesk, Bankman-Fried said he felt ""deeply sorry about what happened"" and what that meant for the company's employees. He did not address allegations that FTX diverted customer and corporate funds to prop up Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research, revelations that Alameda had an exemption from FTX's normal liquidation process or statements that Alameda had loaned funds to FTX officials including himself.  ""I didn't mean for any of this to happen, and I would give anything to be able to go back and do things over again. You were my family,"" he said. ""I've lost that, and our old home is an empty warehouse of monitors. When I turn around, there's no one left to talk to.""  ""I froze up in the face of pressure and leaks and the Binance [letter of intent to purchase FTX] and said nothing,"" he said.  Bankman-Fried stepped down as CEO of FTX on Nov. 11, right before his company filed for bankruptcy. He is not a current employee of the company, new CEO John Ray III has said after Bankman-Fried tweeted multiple threads and spoke to a reporter about the company. Tuesday's letter to FTX employees was posted by a current employee, as Bankman-Fried no longer has access to the company Slack.  According to Bankman-Fried, FTX had around $60 billion in collateral and $2 billion in liabilities this spring, but a market crash meant the collateral's value was halved.  The ""drying up"" of credit in the industry further meant FTX's collateral was worth around $25 billion, though his liabilities measurement jumped to $8 billion.  Another crash in November ""led to another roughly 50% reduction in the value of collateral over a very short period of time,"" which he valued at $17 billion at the time.  The bank run, caused by what Bankman-Fried termed ""attacks"" in November, reduced another $8 billion in collateral, he said.  ""As we frantically put everything together, it became clear that the position was larger than its display on admin/users, because of old fiat deposits before FTX had bank accounts,"" he said. ""I did not realize the full extent of the margin position, nor did I realize the magnitude of the risk posed by a hyper-correlated crash.""  Read more: Lawyers Detail the ‘Abrupt and Difficult’ Collapse of FTX in First Bankruptcy Hearing  Bankman-Fried ""did not realize the full extent of the margin position"" or the risk that a correlated crash meant, he said.  ""The loans and secondary sales were generally used to reinvest in the business – including buying out Binance – and not for large amounts of personal consumption,"" he said.  Bankman-Fried did not address concerns that customer funds were sent from FTX to Alameda, which were raised anew during the company's first bankruptcy hearing earlier Tuesday.  James Bromley of Sullivan & Cromwell, who presented FTX's current state of affairs at the bankruptcy hearing in Delaware, said that ""substantial funds appear to have been transferred"" to Alameda from other companies within the FTX umbrella, some of which were invested in crypto and technology ventures.  ""There were also substantial amounts of money that were spent on things that were not related to the business. For instance, one of the U.S. debtors is an entity that is operated that purchased almost $300 million worth of real estate in the Bahamas,"" Bromley said. ""Based on preliminary investigations, most of those real estate purchases [were] related to homes and vacation properties that were used by senior executives.""  Still, the document provides insight to Bankman-Fried's thinking, including his apparent belief that he should not have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which he first told a Vox reporter last week.  FTX filed for bankruptcy due to ""an extreme amount of coordinated pressure,"" which Bankman-Fried said he agreed to ""reluctantly.""  ""Maybe there is still a chance to save the company,"" he said in the letter Tuesday. ""I believe that there are billions of dollars of genuine interest from new investors that could go to making customers whole. But I can't promise you that anything will happen, because it's not my choice.""  Danny Nelson contributed reporting.

42394088,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXVpR,1669152715,Let's Stop Regulating Crypto Exchanges Like Western Union,"The collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX has been gut-wrenching for its customers, not only those who used its flagship offshore exchange in the Bahamas but also U.S. customers of Chicago-based FTX US.  But there is a silver lining to the FTX debacle. It may put an end to the way that cryptocurrency exchanges are regulated – or, more accurately, misregulated – in the U.S.  U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase, FTX US, and Binance.US are overseen on a state-by-state basis as money transmitters. Money transmitter regulation first emerged in the early 1900s with so-called ""immigrant banks."" Agents would collect funds from local immigrant communities in places like New York City and forward it by steamship to their families back in Europe and elsewhere.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  To protect immigrants from fraudsters, states began to impose licensing requirements on money transmission agents. Each state (except Montana) has evolved its own set of money transmitter laws.  Household names like Western Union and MoneyGram are regulated as money transmitters. Oddly, PayPal was stuffed into this framework in the early 2000s. (It currently boasts money transmitter licenses from 49 states). And then, in the 2010s, crypto exchanges were subsumed under it. (Coinbase has 45 of them.) Later, stablecoins like USD coin were anointed as money transmitters.  In essence, money transmission has become the go-to bin for a motley crew of ""new financial things that people are using that we don't know how to regulate.""  The problem is that the public protections afforded by money transmitter law are inadequate. Dan Awrey, a professor at Cornell University, has documented some of these failings, which include lax bond security requirements, tiny capital requirements, an insufficient ""ring fencing"" of customer funds in the case of bankruptcy and an overly permissive list of investments to which transmitters can deploy their customers' funds.  Read more: Illia Polosukhin - Crypto Didn’t Fail FTX; People Did  The inclusion of crypto exchanges under the money transmitter framework is particularly perplexing. Exchanges like FTX US and Coinbase offer brokerage services and liquid marketplaces for trading. In many cases, these exchanges store a significant chunk of customer’s life savings, for long periods of time. Brokerage and trading are typically the domain of beefier federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which have far stricter rules than money transmission agencies, particularly around custody.  So, to review, crypto exchanges are being regulated in the same manner as the neighborhood money transfer shop, which typically only handles small $200 cash transfers and rarely holds customer funds longer than overnight.  The unfortunate failure of one of these money transmitters, West Realm Shires Services Inc., may be the final straw for this rickety arrangement. West Realm Shires Services is the official name for FTX US, a large spot exchange that serves around 1 million Americans. On its website, FTX US lists the 40 money transmission licenses it has been awarded. For states where it has no licenses, like California, FTX US presumably uses a rent-a-license agreement, whereby it contracts with a third party to ride shotgun under its licenses.  When Sam Bankman-Fried’s 160-company FTX octopus was put into bankruptcy last week, the FTX US spot exchange was one of the entities that found itself on the list. Not only are customers of FTX US embroiled in what could very well become a multiyear bankruptcy process. Thanks to the patchy protection that money transmitter licenses afford to FTX US customers, there is a good chance that when this process finally winds up, customers also won't get their money back.  The bankruptcy status of FTX US stands in sharp contrast to those parts of FTX's U.S. operations that are regulated by the SEC and CFTC. FTX Capital Markets and Embed Clearing, which are both overseen by the SEC, remain solvent and are not listed as debtors in last week's bankruptcy filing. Neither is FTX-owned LedgerX, which offers crypto derivatives and operates under CFTC oversight.  Time to get exchanges like Coinbase under a more appropriate regulatory umbrella before additional damage is done.  It's too early, to be sure, but it appears that something about these three subsidiaries' SEC and CFTC oversight has afforded them – and their customers – enough protection to stay solvent.  In a different world, one where the FTX US exchange was regulated by the CFTC and SEC, might FTX US and its one million customers have been likewise spared? It's very possible.  Things didn't have to be this way. For two years now, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been politely asking crypto exchanges like FTX US to submit to SEC oversight. But FTX US didn't listen. Nor did any of FTX US’ competitors. They kept coasting on their money transmitter licenses. And now FTX US customers appear to be in trouble. While exchanges certainly bear part of the blame for not complying, so does Gensler for not pushing hard enough for exchanges to come in and register.  There’s an easy fix. It's time for U.S. crypto exchanges to face the same rules as non-crypto marketplaces and brokers.  There's precedent for this in Canada. After the massive QuadrigaCX failure in 2019, securities regulators forced all Canadian crypto exchanges to register with watchdogs such as the Ontario Securities Commission, the closest thing that Canada has to the SEC. Canadian dollar balances at one exchange, Coinsquare, are even protected by the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF), the Canadian equivalent of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides insurance to customers of failed broker-dealers.  This new and much more robust framework seems to have kept Canadians safe from a FTX-type failure. FTX International and FTX US, for instance, have been refusing to onboard Canadian customers for over a year now, much to Canadians’ benefit.  Arrayed against the idea of putting crypto exchanges under SEC or CFTC oversight are exchange executives, and you can see why. The local money transmission examiner is never going to be strict as a Federal securities watchdog.  Oddly, some crypto critics are also insisting that crypto exchanges remain unregulated. Economists Stephen Cecchetti and Kermit Schoenholtz, for instance, recently argued that post-FTX, the world should just let crypto burn. To regulate crypto would be to grant it unwarranted legitimacy, they say.  The problem with the let-it-burn view is that crypto has crashed and burned many times. Each time it roars back, only for more retail customers to lose all their funds to the next Mt Gox, Quadriga, or FTX US.  Time to get exchanges like FTX US and its competitors, including Coinbase, under a more appropriate regulatory umbrella before additional damage is done. Exchanges aren’t money transmitters, and shouldn’t be regulated as such. They’re much more than that.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/22/lets-stop-regulating-crypto-exchanges-like-western-union,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dedfb3693de90241768c1944d00f21c58da86c4c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BNB’s price continues to look weak as bearish market sentiments increase, with things looking uncertain for most traders and investors. BNB’s price looks weak and continues to trade below the daily 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as bulls attempt to reclaim the region. The price action displayed by Binance Coin (BNB) has not met expectations, with the price showing so much price action in recent weeks, rallying to a high of $390. Following the collapse of the FTX effect affecting small crypto projects like Genesis as the market continues to look weak on each passing day signifying the bottom is not yet in, leading to the price of many altcoins, including Binance Coin (BNB), battling for survival. The Domino effect of the FTX saga on investors has left the market at a standstill as the market has yet to make a major move after previous weeks saw the price of BNB struggling to hold above $250.

The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases leading to more sell orders than buy orders as the price of BNB is left on balance. FTX and Genesis’s news have hugely impacted the price of altcoins, including BNB, which has escalated the price to a region of $250 as the price bounced off this region to reclaim $260. After the price of BNB closed below the weekly high of $260, there are high chances of the market going lower, with the prices of BNB struggling to hold up. Weekly resistance for the price of BNB – $280. Weekly support for the price of BNB – $250. Price Analysis Of BNB On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of BNB remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $260 support after bouncing off from the region of $250 on several instances. The price of BNB trades at $262; the price needs to hold strong above this region for the price to rally to a high of $280, where it would face resistance to trend higher. If the price of BNB breaks below $250, we could see more sell-off, as this has been an area of interest to hold off bears. Daily resistance for the BNB price – $280. Daily support for the BNB price – $250-$260.

42413596,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA2uu,1669151634,Mango Exploiter's Funds Get Liquidated After Roiling Aave Using $20M of Borrowed Curve Tokens,"A well-known crypto trader linked to last month’s $114 million Mango Markets exploit is at it again – but this time appears to have gotten hung up.  The trader, identified on Twitter and tagged by blockchain analysts as Avraham Eisenberg, borrowed 40 million curve (CRV) tokens (worth $20 million at the time) using the decentralized lending platform Aave, then transferred them to the OKEx crypto exchange.  But after a series of wild swings in the CRV price, Eisenberg's position appears to have gotten liquidated.  According to the blockchain analysis firm Arkham, Eisenberg borrowed the majority of CRV tokens on Aave by pledging $40 million in USDC stablecoin as collateral.  According to blockchain data, he then sent the 40 million CRV to crypto exchange OKEx in two transactions – possibly putting the tokens in position for a quick sale.  Blockchain sleuths on Twitter speculated that he appeared to be building up a CRV short position – that is, to profit off a price decline.  CRV’s price declined early Tuesday, then shot up 75% within a few hours, according to CoinDesk pricing data, in what appeared to be a short squeeze.  Foiled?  In the end, all of Eisenberg’s CRV loan was liquidated, leaving Aave with $1.6 million of bad debt, according to blockchain data by Blockanalitica. The amount is insignificant relative to the $6 billion total value locked on the protocol.  “He ultimately didn't have enough initial capital to make the 'profitable trade' work,” Dustin Teander, analyst of blockchain intelligence firm Messari, told CoinDesk.  Eisenberg had not returned a request for comment as of press time.  The dramatic sequence of events comes just five weeks after Eisenberg outlined a plan to exploit a loophole in Aave’s collateral accounting system.  This could have created a vicious cycle for the lending protocol, which could be “very dangerous for Aave,” Arkham tweeted earlier today.  'Highly profitable trading strategy'  Eisenberg describes himself on his Twitter profile as an “applied game theorist” and includes a quote attributed to Scott Alexander that reads, ""not … a very serious person.”  He became infamous in crypto circles for draining $114 million from Mango Markets, a Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, by exploiting a loophole in October.  He later returned $67 million to Mango and defended his attempt as being “legal” and not an exploit but a “highly profitable trading strategy,” which has since become a meme on Crypto Twitter.

42413607,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA368,1669151276,On-Chain Data Shows Close Ties Between FTX and Alameda Were There From the Start: Nansen,"Despite claims by the companies to the contrary, blockchain data shows crypto exchange FTX and sister company Alameda Research were very much connected from the beginning, said Niklas Polk, a research analyst at analytics firm Nansen.  Polk told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday that on-chain data shows the two companies had been closely intertwined since 2019. But making sense of the data could be the reason why no one saw the FTX collapse coming. The centralized exchange capitalized on its obscurity, he said.  “We could see that something’s going on, that they’re closely connected, that there are sufficient flows,” Polk said, referring to Nansen’s latest report, which takes a deeper look at what may have been happening between the corporate siblings. “But since FTX is a centralized entity, you can’t really see what’s happening inside [and] you can’t really know how much money should be there.”  Read more: Lawyers Detail the ‘Abrupt and Difficult’ Collapse of FTX in First Bankruptcy Hearing  What was evident, said Polk, was that coins were flowing between wallets. Specifically, most of FTX’s native token, FTT, was found in the wallets of the exchange and Alameda, with only a fraction of tokens making it into circulation.  What Nansen suspects is the people responsible for the wallets may have been moving tokens between the two, making the interaction between the two supposedly separate companies closer than any two companies should ever be, according to Polk.  Even Tuesday, during FTX’s day in court, there were still some wallets, holding around $10.7 million worth of FTT tokens, according to Nansen, that remain in limbo.  Read more: FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance, and Proved the Need for DeFi / Opinion  “They’re still lying there today and we don’t know who those wallets belong to,” Polk said, adding that the tokens in some wallets “have never been touched.”  According to the firm’s report, whether FTX issued a loan to Alameda is “not directly visible on-chain” because of FTX’s centralized structure. However, Nansen implies that the $4 billion of FTT tokens Alameda deposited to FTX may have been used as a way to repay loans issued by FTX.  FTX and Alameda’s checkered synergy is “one of the big reasons why we have blockchains,” Polk said, adding that on-chain data is a way to provide “transparent” information to all users.",NEGATIVE,FTT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | RESEARCH | FTT,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/22/on-chain-data-shows-close-ties-between-ftx-and-alameda-were-there-from-the-start-nansen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/717e2edb921e092f989583f31d5ae99729734ea5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420884,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZLp,1669150936,Crypto Market Analysis: Investors See Few Encouraging Signs,"Any dataset of the most recent quarterly returns for crypto assets would undoubtedly reveal a sea of red, the latest chapter in a year of epic declines.  Even among the few cryptocurrencies that gained ground, the news is grim. Their price increases seem more like isolated circumstances rather than the initial hints of a trend upward, as one popular investment tool, Relative Rotation Graphs, indicates. RRGs offer visual representations of asset trends and can help investors foresee shifts in pricing – positive and negative.  Assets with positive returns  Looking at the top 50 assets by market capitalization (Messari) shows the following with positive returns over the most recent 90 days. (The list excludes stablecoins and LUNC.)  Dogecoin (DOGE): 13.84%  Polygon (MATIC): 3.93%  Litecoin (LTC): 24.03%  The Open Network (TONCOIN): 20.96%  Quant Network (QNT): 0.80%  OKB (OKB): 16.07%  Trust Wallet Token (TWT): 112.83%  Ripple (XRP): 7.39%  XRP, DOGE, and LTC all act primarily as currencies, but otherwise each coin on the above list fits within a distinct category, so their gains cannot be attributed to particular events or industry-specific trends.  TWT is the biggest outlier with a 90-day return of nearly 113%. A closer look shows that much of TWT’s gains occurred over the most recent 11 days. Prices increased from an open of $1.04 on Nov. 10 to as high as $2.74 on Nov. 14. Prices have since retreated to $2.23, and volume has waned substantially as well.  TWT’s 24-hour volume ranks just 29th among assets at $42 million in real volume daily. By comparison, BTC’s daily volume is $3.7 billion. The low volume by comparison is noteworthy, as lower activity can lead to wider price swings.  What RRGs are showing  Developed by Julius de Kempanaer, RRGs allow users to view asset performance in four distinct quadrants.  Leading: High relative performance and momentum  Weakening: Strong relative performance and slowing momentum  Lagging: Weak relative performance and momentum  Improving: Weak relative performance but increasing momentum  In orderly markets, assets tend to move through each quadrant sequentially.  A strategy often employed in using RRGs is to identify assets moving into the improving quadrant, with the expectation that in short order it will begin leading the benchmark.  If using RRGs in isolation, there doesn’t appear to be much opportunity in the above set because six of the eight assets are either lagging the SPX or weakening versus the SPX. OKB and TWT are currently leading, but TWT’s status is driven by extremely recent price activity.  But what happens when we apply a Relative Rotation Graph to the assets with the highest market capitalizations? Unfortunately for bullish investors, there isn’t a lot to see at the moment. Using the SPX as a benchmark shows that BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP and ADA are showing both weak performance and momentum relative to the benchmark.  Weak relative performance is to be expected given recent events. In coming weeks, investors will likely be searching for strengthening momentum, increasing their allocations again. For context, we last saw BTC within the improving quadrant on Sept. 27, moving into the leading quadrant though Oct. 13. For ETH, we last saw it move from improving to leading between Oct. 25 and Nov. 9.  But a repeat seems unlikely at the moment.

42394100,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXWoz,1669149858,"The Gaming Industry Doesn’t Need Web3, but Gamers Might","We are many months into the bear market that followed nearly 18 months of crypto hype. This boom was dominated by non-fungible tokens (NFT), and during this time a distinct narrative emerged around Web3 gaming. Predicated on early successes such as CryptoKitties, Web3 gaming became the Holy Grail that would finally bring together the scarcity of NFTs, the incentivization of cryptocurrencies and the utility of the metaverse.  So here we are, a year and a half past one of the most remarkable bull markets in the history of crypto. Yet, Web3 gaming isn’t here in the way many predicted. The gaming industry wasn’t taken over, and we have no shining examples of Web3 gaming live in today’s market. The future of Web3 gaming is still bright but it won’t be possible without understanding where we went wrong in this most recent cycle. Specifically, how we were pushing subpar products onto an industry that didn’t need them and gamers who didn’t want them.  Everett Muzzy is the senior vice president of content, community and social at Serotonin.  Gaming doesn’t need crypto  The traditional gaming industry is on a tear. Its 2022 market cap is $222 billion, and is projected to increase by nearly 50% in the next four years alone. All of this growth is projected without even considering Web3. Innovation in gaming is happening at a breakneck pace with engines like Unreal, AR software, VR hardware and more.  Acknowledging the remarkable pace of innovation in Web3, today’s infrastructure cannot scale to the computing power needed to enable today’s AAA games. This shouldn’t surprise anyone, nor does it mean that Web3 will never scale to the degree it needs. What it does mean, however, is the crypto industry was attempting to bring to market a technology that didn’t line up with the infrastructure needs of the incumbent industry. We may have wanted Web3 gaming to explode onto the scene, but the reality is that the gaming industry just doesn’t need blockchain technology right now.  See also: How the Metaverse Could Be a Game-Changer for NFT Gaming  No, gaming doesn’t need crypto – but gamers might  The most popular arguments in favor of Web3 gaming don’t focus on the infrastructure capabilities of the technology, for the reasons stated above. Rather, the validation for Web3 gaming typically hinges on providing gamers with a richer, more complete gaming experience. The argument goes like this: Games built on blockchain technology can provide gamers with true asset ownership, financial opportunity and creative feedback loops with studios, to name a few. The history of gaming is rife with examples of how gamers have felt cheated or deceived by the industry they love. Web3 principles of sovereignty and collaboration can offer a way for gamers to benefit more richly from the games into which they already pour their time and commitment.  Despite that narrative, the most vocal critics of Web3 gaming since the start of the recent bull market haven’t been gaming studios or publishers, but rather the gamers themselves. Abject vitriol has been directed at Web3 gaming proponents, citing everything from disappointing gameplay to outright fraud.  If gamers and Web3 are supposedly so aligned at their core values, why did the relationship become so strained in the last bull market?  Gameplay, gameplay, gameplay  Ask nearly anyone what the most successful Web3 games are and you’ll get answers like Axie Infinity, DeFi Kingdoms and Wolf Game. These apps gained significant attention (and capital) during the bull market, and came to represent the first wave of “proven” Web3 games. In reality, these titles were little more than decentralized finance (DeFi) apps with a veneer of design and gamification. Any traditional gamer familiar with the fidelity, storyline and aesthetic of titles like Stardew Valley would certainly bristle if they were told that DeFi Kingdoms was the future of gaming.  Nearly every in-market Web3 game during the bull market violated a known rule in gameplay development: Do not overfinancialize the experience. Gamers have made this very clear in the past. In 2012, Diablo III was released with an in-game auction house that kicked back a percentage of each transaction to Blizzard. Diablo III gamers revolted so severely to the auction house that in the next update Blizzard removed it completely.  Read more: Watch Out for Illicit Actors Gaming Crypto Games | Opinion  The lesson is actually quite simple: Gamers despise the prioritization of monetization over gameplay. Nearly every in-market Web3 “game” during this last bull market was primarily a financial application – and gamers sniffed that out immediately. (It’s worth pausing here for a moment to call out a notable outlier: NFT trading card games. The Web3 versions of these games have proven quite successful, likely because their traditional card game counterparts also have a fundamentally financial element in their trading, selling, buying and rarity.)  Web3 gaming isn’t conceptually misaligned with what gamers want but before gamers will even begin to consider the upsides, gameplay must be prioritized above all else.  The next level  In this most recent cycle, gamers have emerged on the other side unscathed. Web3 hasn’t made a significant impact on their daily lives, and they haven’t had to contend with shifting priorities of the games they love or the studios that create them. However, both the gaming and the Web3 ecosystems will continue innovating. As Web3 infrastructure catches up with Web2 capabilities, blockchain-based gaming will be reintroduced to the market. These games will need to attract communities of gamers, and they should look to this most recent bull market for examples of how not to communicate.  More than anything else, gamers want fun, aesthetic games. We want to lose ourselves in the story. Constantly being reminded of financial undertones interrupts that escape and degrades the experience. For Web3 games to be successful, they must above all else be fun to play. It sounds simple, but the most recent attempt to bring Web3 gaming to market suggests we in crypto have a lot more to learn.",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Everett Muzzy,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/22/the-gaming-industry-doesnt-need-web3-but-gamers-might,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1544e8e8180c8d1d3513f2edcfa76921fee61f9-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Recall towards the end of April when the asset management giant said it will start to offer bitcoin-linked 401( K ) plans. But bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as well as the broader crypto market had been dealt a slew of heavy blows since then, including the high-profile implosions of crypto lender Celsius, Terra ecosystem, hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX. BTC changed hands at just $16.15K at the time of writing, down 16% in the past month, -66% year-to-date and -71% from a year ago. The demise of FTX ""has made it abundantly clear the digital asset industry has serious problems,” the Senators wrote in a letter addressed to Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson. ""The ill-advised, deceptive, and potentially illegal actions of a few have a direct impact on the valuation of bitcoin and other digital assets."" In May, Warren already called for clarity on Fidelity's decision to add bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to its 401(k) plans, especially regarding how the retirement product will address risks to its customers. “Since our previous letter, the digital asset industry has only grown more volatile, tumultuous, and chaotic—all features of an asset class no plan sponsor or person saving for retirement should want to go anywhere near,” the Senators wrote. As the FTX fiasco sends shockwaves through the wider crypto ecosystem, lawmakers and regulators have increasingly put crypto-related firms under the spotlight. SoFi Technologies ( SOFI ), for example, has seen its stock trading in a downward spiral this week after legislators sent letters to financial regulators urging them to review the company's crypto trading activities.

42413608,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA34G,1669147396,Genesis Global Capital Has Hired Investment Bank Moelis to Explore Options Including Bankruptcy: New York Times,"Genesis Global Capital has hired investment bank Moelis & Company to explore options, including a potential bankruptcy, The New York Times reported, citing three people familiar with the situation.  There haven't been any final decisions made and it is still possible for the company to avoid a bankruptcy filing, the report said.  Genesis had spent much of November scrambling to raise fresh capital or reach a deal with creditors thanks to its exposure to collapsed crypto exchange FTX. The company's institutional lending unit last week was forced to suspend redemptions and new originations. Genesis also previously disclosed that its derivatives unit had about $175 million in locked funds in its FTX trading account. As a result, parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) opted to strengthen Genesis’ balance sheet with an equity infusion of $140 million.  DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  Several months ago Genesis reportedly suffered losses of hundreds of millions of dollars due to loans made to failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  Separately on Tuesday, DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert disclosed in a note to shareholders that DCG had a roughly $575 million liability to Genesis Global Capital, which is due in May 2023.  ""In recent days, there has been chatter about intercompany loans between Genesis Global Capital and DCG,"" Silbert wrote. ""For those unaware, in the ordinary course of business, DCG has borrowed money from Genesis Global Capital in the same vein as hundreds of crypto investment firms. These loans were always structured on an arm’s length basis and priced at prevailing market interest rates. DCG currently has a liability to Genesis Global Capital of ~$575 million, which is due in May 2023. These loans were used to fund investment opportunities and to repurchase DCG stock from non-employee shareholders in secondary transactions previously highlighted in quarterly shareholder updates.""  Silbert also reminded investors of a $1.1 billion promissory note that is due in June 2032, noting that this was related to liabilities from Genesis related to the Three Arrows Capital default.

42394101,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXWzF,1669146561,Steps to Crypto Recovery: Where ‘We’ Go From Here,"What a horrible couple of weeks. Very few of us have not passed through some degree of surprise, disbelief, shock, anger, sadness, fear and betrayal. Many, tragically, have had life-changing amounts of money disappear, at a time of peak economic uncertainty. Even those more fortunate are reeling from a toxic combination of dismay, disgust and perhaps depression.  We’ve also had to deal with a handful of outsiders declaring, “Told you so!” and “Crypto should die.” Critics are plenty right to point out the hubris, ego and lack of common sense that, yes, is prevalent in our industry. But the gleeful victory lap from skeptics compounds our embarrassment and shame.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Now we need to think about moving on. No, it’s not too soon.  The first step involves, well, figuring out the first step. In my opinion, it involves clearing up one significant misconception: that “we” are going to come up with “a solution.”  I have been asked often over the past week: “How can we make sure this doesn’t happen again?” My response is, who is “we” here?  Crypto has never spoken with one voice, and it’s not going to start doing so now. Even the idea that consensus for such a diverse ecosystem is an ideal outcome is disconcerting. The origin of the industry is based on the free-market ideology that people should be able to choose their methods of transaction and representations of value, and that experimentation can directly test new incentives and forms of governance in a real market. It is up to us to evaluate risks – we may be bad at doing so, but we hopefully learn from mistakes and end up gravitating toward more reliable actors.  The best we can hope for is that we’re smarter and more demanding in future.  And what do we mean by “make sure”? Those words imply a level of control that goes against crypto’s originating ethos. How do we ensure mistakes are not made? By dampening innovation and insisting on mass obedience to a strict set of often impractical rules. Parents know this dilemma: You can make sure your kids don’t get hurt by letting them play only under your supervision, and even then with lots of padding. But what kind of a life is that for them, or you? Instead, you can teach them to do what they can to minimize risk, and when they fall, get back up again and recalibrate.  The crypto industry will make mistakes again, as it should, because that is an integral part of experimentation. Participants can learn to be more careful, take less at face value, distrust the aura of celebrity, question established beliefs and research alternatives. But let’s be realistic. We’re human, most of us seek convenience over safety, and we instinctively trust our friends. So, we can’t “make sure” this doesn’t happen again, and nor should we insist on that. The best we can hope for is that we’re smarter and more demanding in future, because no one wants to repeat the past few months.  Free market imperative  So it’s time to reframe the question in more free-market terms. Instead of ineffectually grasping for a communal answer, how about: What can I do to improve the industry? What can I do to protect myself better? What can I do to help others?  Another question I get often is: “What should we do now?” This is natural. We want a solution, and we want someone to give it to us. Many think the solution is regulation, which means we’re walking into a situation the authorities have long expected. Regulation is not the full answer – rules did not stop Enron, Bernie Madoff, MF Global, Archegos and similar catastrophic examples from happening. But our instinct is to run to the powers-that-be for safety.  Yet, even from their point of view, there is no consensus. An editorial in the Financial Times last week suggested that “we should simply let crypto burn.” Who the “we” is in that phrase is unclear. Who has enough authority to just “let crypto burn?” No one. Some regulators see a threat worth curtailing. Many (including the new House of Representatives majority whip and the incoming head of the House Financial Services Committee) see innovation worth supporting. Others just don’t care. There is no “we.”  Read more: Noelle Acheson - After FTX: Rebuilding Trust in Crypto’s Founding Mission  This recent emphasis on the plural pronoun is understandable: We all seek comfort in the group in times of fear. But it is also dangerous because emotional mobs can wreak havoc. Scrolling through Twitter over the past couple of days, I saw signs of an industry turning against itself, a mass purge disguised as an attempt at community protection. History tells us this is rarely useful.  So let’s stop stressing about what “we” want, because there is no “we” with the authority to decide what that even is. What we can do is use our individual priorities and abilities to help fix what we feel needs fixing. We don’t need consensus or permission for that.  Speaking for myself, I am going to work so hard to continue explaining our industry to anyone interested, to poke holes in easy conclusions and to question investment orthodoxies. It’s what I can do. And all of you reading this have talents you can apply, even outside the crypto sphere, to further whatever characteristics you would like to see more of here.  It’s time to drag ourselves away from doomscrolling and the instinctive fascination with deranged tweets. It’s time to look beyond the gloom of the current newsfeed. It’s time for us all to dust ourselves off, take care of our wounds and get back to work.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong appeared to respond soon after on Twitter: ""If you see FUD out there – remember, our financials are public (we're a public company),"" referring to crypto parlance for fear, uncertainty and doubt.

Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at about $16,100, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization hit a two-year low of $15,480 Monday as jitters over trading firm Genesis' future loomed over the market.  “It seems crypto traders are already pricing in a bankruptcy for crypto lender Genesis,” Edward Moya, an analyst at foreign-exchange broker Oanda, wrote in a note on Tuesday.  On Monday, Genesis said it had “no plans to file bankruptcy imminently.” The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar, reported that Genesis sought funding from Binance and Apollo Global Management, and that Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, declined to invest, citing potential conflicts of interest. (Genesis' owner, Digital Currency Group, is also the parent company of CoinDesk.)  Ether (ETH) has followed a similar trajectory to bitcoin, rising roughly 2.5% to $1,120. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was recently up 1.7%.  And yet analysts are giving bearish warnings with crypto markets still digesting the collapse of the FTX exchange that shook the industry.  Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, told CoinDesk that as the market is “in digestion,” it’s possible to see BTC drop further – possibly to $12,500 before the end of the year.  According to Kempenaer, big events in markets can go two ways for prices: “It can go to a very rapid decline, market resets as the market digests what’s going on. Or it goes, 'Market needs time and moves sideways,' maybe slightly lower.”  Moya noted that a rebound on Wall Street might provide the support for bitcoin to remain stable but that the scenario “seems unlikely” because the bear market in stocks “has yet to bottom out.”  The S&P 500 index was up 0.7% Tuesday, an is up 3% in the past month after the release of better-than-expected inflation data for October. Goldman Sachs strategists, however, warned that the near-term path for stocks is “likely to be volatile and down.”  Meanwhile, Moya wrote, “Bitcoin has support ahead of the $15,500 level, but if that does not hold, technical selling could send prices toward the $13,500 region.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/22/bitcoin-regains-16k-but-analysts-are-still-bearish,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77edc8fa2e6dcd6059e19c5ca292ed704519839e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Like all crypto, the price has suffered because of FTX. The Ripple Q3 report announced ODL launching in Brazil but has no new RippleNet volume numbers to monitor overall progress against SWIFT. Activity has ramped up in the SEC case against Ripple, but it appears no conclusion will be reached at least until early 2023. Research in my first article attempts to show there's not enough real-world adoption to justify a long-term position in Ripple's XRP token ( XRP-USD ). But there is a great opportunity to buy during the headwinds from the SEC lawsuit and sell on news of a settlement or legal victory. In this update, we'll look at the macro headwinds for crypto, examine the announcements from Ripple's Q3 2022 XRP Markets Report, and check the latest on the SEC case and when it might be completed. Market update and price action Exactly like my August update , the lead headline is a catastrophic event - this time the collapse of FTX and the specter of further contagion throughout the industry. The alleged amount of misdealings at FTX is truly mind-boggling and new CEO John J. Ray, who cleaned up the mess at Enron almost 20 years ago, said the following : Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" Ray said. ""From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented. If the tragedy of people losing their coins on FTX wasn't enough, further contagion in the industry is now a legitimate concern. Firms like Voyager (VYGVQ-USD) who were bailed out by FTX after the Terra Luna (LUNC-USD) and Three Arrows Capital disaster must now find new bidders for their assets. BlockFi announced that it is pausing client withdrawals and limiting platform activity. Some believe a bankruptcy filing is imminent. Cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital has paused withdrawals and loan applications following the collapse of FTX. Since Genesis powers the Gemini Earn program for the Gemini Exchange, the Earn program can no longer honor withdrawals. Coins are flowing off Gemini and other centralized exchanges because users fear assets could be trapped like they are on Celsius (CEL-USD), Voyager, Vauld, and now BlockFi. In the midst of this madness, the price of XRP has dropped from a high of $.50 in early November back to the mid $.30 range. However, it's important to realize all of crypto has been similarly affected. Ripple does not seem to have any exposure to FTX or the related companies suffering contagion. XRP and related industry news Ripple publishes a quarterly XRP Markets Report to provide regular updates on the general state of crypto markets and specific news about XRP. In the Q3 2022 Report , Ripple's XRP holdings were revealed to be below 50 billion coins or 50% of the total outstanding supply for the first time. The company claims the reduced XRP ownership is an indicator that the XRP Ledger is not controlled by Ripple. There were two announcements about On-Demand Liquidity (ODL). First was the partnership with Travelex Bank to launch ODL in Brazil, with the beginning step of allowing transactions between Brazil and Mexico. Silvio Pegado, Managing Director of LATAM at Ripple said , More than $780 billion in payments are sent into Brazil annually, making it an opportune market for both Ripple as well as customers who will benefit from the capabilities of crypto to enable cheaper and faster cross-border payments. Travelex is focused on improving global payments and is known for embracing cutting edge technology, making them the perfect partner for Ripple. Also, FOMO Pay will use Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity for same-day crypto-enabled treasury payment and settlement. Previously, FOMO Pay's treasury managers used other methods of payment, which typically took 1-2 days to reach target accounts. ""As one of the leading payment institutions in Singapore, FOMO Pay aims to provide our clients with more efficient and cost-effective payment modes in different currencies. We are excited to partner with Ripple to leverage On-Demand Liquidity for treasury management, which allows us to achieve affordable and instant settlement in EUR and USD globally,"" said Louis Liu, Founder and CEO of FOMO Pay. Long time Ripple client I-Remit, Inc. has serviced the remittance needs of overseas Filipinos for two decades. It is now expanding use of Ripple's ODL solution in order to improve its cross-border treasury flow and move towards real-time settlement. Unfortunately, the Q3 Market Report did not include any update on RippleNet's run rate, last projected at $15 billion per year. At this volume, RippleNet's volume is not a threat to the SWIFT network's huge trillion dollar a day market share and will not be a factor in moving the price of the token. One thing that should be addressed is the rumor that SWIFT will use XRP. The idea has circulated that the implementation is incredibly hush-hush and until ""the switch is flipped"" and the network is enabled we won't hear anything about it. Possible? I suppose anything is possible. Probable? My estimation is very low. Financial institutions are actually very transparent (and need to be per government regulations) with their plans and directions. I've found no evidence that XRP will be used as a bridge currency for the SWIFT network. I'd love to see any credible documentation that indicates the contrary. But it's NOT proof to cite Ripple as an ISO 20022 participant, SWIFT as ISO 20022 participant, and then assume that SWIFT must use XRP. Every major financial institution has adopted ISO 20022 in principle and is quickly moving toward implementation. It's a huge leap of logic to believe RippleNet is involved with every ISO 20022 implementation, or to even believe XRP usage must be implied with RippleNet usage. Crypto influencers make these types of assertions all the time, but the prudent investor must separate wishful thinking from documented fact. In August, the Federal Reserve Board announced details of the FedNow℠ Service, a new 24x7x365 interbank settlement service with clearing functionality to support instant payments in the US. This is an example of how legacy institutions are upgrading existing payments infrastructure to support near instant payments, which is not a good trend for Ripple. The platforms progressing ahead of XRP are 1) stablecoins as settlement instruments (using the Ethereum network as the bridge) 2) the multi-CBDC Project Dunbar endorsed by the 63 central banks of the BIS (using proprietary stablecoins as a bridge) and 3) the SWIFT gpi and adoption of ISO 20022 (using proprietary bridge technology). What's happening with the SEC case? In this past quarter, we saw amazing industry support for Ripple against the SEC. Sentiment is also shifting towards Ripple as the probable winner of the case. This is all good news for those holding XRP. Coinbase (COIN), the largest exchange in the US, filed an amicus brief in support of Ripple. The exchange highlighted whether the SEC provided ""fair notice"" prior to bringing its enforcement action, taking a dig at the common industry complaint that the regulator has not provided clear guidance to businesses in the process. Coinbase joins the Blockchain Association and many other organizations voicing their concerns about the case and showing support for Ripple. Crypto legal expert Jeremy Hogan said the amicus briefs filed are weakening the SEC's case. ""One of the things you see when you look at these amicus briefs is that some parts are filling in the holes for Ripple and some parts are making new holes in the SEC's argument."" Sentiment about the case is rapidly changing as well, with more legal experts and pundits affirming that Ripple has a very real chance to win the case outright. But despite the industry support, the case could still take months to wrap up. CEO Brad Garlinghouse offered a guess that it could be completed in the first half of 2023. Defense lawyer James Filan predicts that ""District Judge Torres will decide both the Expert Motions and the Summary Judgment motions at the same time - on or before March 31, 2023."" Conclusion Ripple's 3Q 2022 report shows notable activity with existing and new clients around treasury management using ODL. In the ill-fated MoneyGram partnership, ODL for treasury payments was actually the only real application for XRP. So perhaps this utility is an emerging use case for XRP. However, I don't see this changing the long-term prospects for the token. And until a clear ruling is made regarding the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit, the XRP price will continue to move with the rest of crypto, driven by industry-specific events like the FTX debacle. I remain open to new evidence for XRP adoption, but for now, retain my conviction to sell my XRP stake when the SEC suit is resolved.",NEUTRAL,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559907-ripple-buy-sec-uncertainty-sell-settlement-news-november-update?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4648446.jpeg

Ethereum Whales Now Hold 947,940 ETH More In Their Wallets As per data from the analytics firm Santiment, this jump in the whale holdings is the 5th largest in this year so far. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us the percentage of the total Ethereum supply that each wallet group has right now. Wallets are divided into these groups based on the number of coins they are currently holding. For example, the 1-10 coins group includes all wallets that are storing amounts in this range at the moment. The Supply Distribution metric for this cohort then measures what percentage of the total supply is made up by the sum of coins in these wallets specifically. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this Ethereum indicator for the 10k-1m coins group over the last twelve months: Looks like the value of the metric has sharply gone up in recent days | Source: Santiment The significance of the 10k-1m coins group is that it represents the wallets owned by large Ethereum whales. In the USD, this range corresponds to holdings worth between $10.9 million and $1 billion. As you can see in the above graph, the Supply Distribution value for this ETH wallet group has shot up recently.

Over the past two months, there has been an enormous rate of withdrawal from exchanges as investors and traders seek to reduce the risks. A significant share of Alameda Research's capital was held in FTT, which could lead to the collapse of FTX and its subsidiaries. During the current crypto crisis, I expect that many cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, will continue to lose customers, which will lead to a deterioration in their financial situation. Bitcoin mining difficulty continues to increase, which creates additional pressure on crypto miners. At the beginning of November 2022, the collapse of the FTX ( FTT-USD ) cryptocurrency exchange began, which with a high degree of probability will lead to the massive bankruptcy of its subsidiaries and will directly affect the mining company and other crypto exchanges. The events that the crypto industry has faced have shocked the entire world of finance and once again indicated the need for more stringent regulation to protect investors. The collapse of FTX was reminiscent of the events of February 2014, when Mt. Gox , the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time, which accounted for about 70% of all Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) transactions, had to suspend its activities as a result of cyber attacks that led to the loss of clients' assets over $500 million. In the same year, the exchange declared bankruptcy, which only increased the distrust of people who viewed cryptocurrencies as an analog to traditional financial instruments. As a result, the price of Bitcoin fell by more than 80% in less than a year before the bottom was reached for this asset, followed by the start of a new bull cycle, drawing the attention of millions of people to cryptocurrencies around the world. Source: N_Aisenstadt — TradingView This article will provide an analysis of the impact of the FTX collapse on the financial position of other cryptocurrency exchanges and on the confidence of long-term investors in BTC, the risks of a domino effect, and the current state of mining and Bitcoin at a time of growing global macroeconomic and geopolitical problems that continue to kill investment interest in high-risk assets. Before the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange In mid-2021, FTX launched a series of investment products that allowed exchange customers to earn money by holding cryptocurrencies or fiat money in their deposit wallets under the “Earn Up to 8%” program. Relatively high-interest rates on deposits attracted hundreds of thousands of people, some of whom took out loans from banks to take advantage of such a generous offer. Given the increase in interest rates by central banks, rising inflation, and a decrease in interest in cryptocurrencies since the beginning of 2022, it was already becoming clear that the exchange could not legitimately give FTX customers such a high return. One of the last and most significant signals that FTX’s financial situation is far from ideal came eight days before the news of the suspension of withdrawals from the crypto exchange, when the company’s Twitter account announced the imposition of restrictions on the “Earn Up to 8%” program. Source: Twitter account of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange As a result of program policy changes , the maximum amount on deposit wallets that customers could earn income from was limited to $100,000, while the annual interest rate was also reduced from 8% to 5% if the balance exceeded $10,000. Source: FTX Many investors and traders were confident in the safety of storing their assets on the FTX crypto exchange, as its reputation was on par with Binance ( BNB-USD ). Sam Bankman-Fried, as CEO of FTX and one of the leaders of the cryptocurrency community, actively interacted with regulators in the United States and other countries to achieve recognition of cryptocurrency exchanges and the prospects for transactions with digital assets. The current situation with FTX reserves At the moment, the mechanism that led to the loss of deposits of FTX customers is not fully understood, but many investigations, including those published on Coindesk, indicate that Alameda Research played a key role in this. A significant portion of Alameda Research's capital was held in FTT, which is FTX's centrally controlled token. As a result, a company run by Sam Bankman-Freed could manipulate the value of this token by raising its price to use it as collateral as part of Alameda Research's credit policy. However, following the disclosure of FTX's financial difficulties, Binance's desire to sell its holdings in FTT, and given the token's low trading volume, resulted in FTT's plummeting over 90%. As a result of FTT's price drop, the value of the collateral depreciated, causing a liquidity crunch and eventually creating an $8 billion hole in the FTX cryptocurrency exchange's balance sheet. Source: N_Aisenstadt — TradingView At the end of March 2022, the reserves of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange reached multi-quarter highs of more than 135 thousand Bitcoins. However, in the 2nd quarter of 2022, this indicator showed multidirectional dynamics, either rising sharply from the beginning, then declining by 47%. In September, the company's reserves stabilized only for a short period, as if showing FTX customers that the financial position of the exchange is stable and that it is not worth fearing its bankruptcy. The stability of the company was fake, and from mid-September, its reserves continued to decline, and after the public disclosure of FTX's problems, there were only 4,909 Bitcoins on the balance of the exchange. Although there is still no official report from the regulators, however, I believe that the collapse of Alameda Research and the emergence of FTX's financial problems occurred as a result of the collapse of LUNA (LUNC-USD) in May 2022. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode In addition to FTX's Bitcoin and Ethereum reserves ( ETH-USD ), the cryptocurrency exchange also held reserves in stablecoins, whose combined value exceeded $1 billion at the beginning of February 2022. However, after that, stablecoin balances plummeted, thus giving the first signals of a certain depreciation of FTX's balance sheet, which required the conversion of stablecoins to Bitcoin as collateral for loans. The most recent decline in the stablecoin balances occurred at the end of October 2022, when their combined value fell from $630 million to virtually zero in less than two weeks. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Before proceeding to the analysis of the price of Bitcoin, it is necessary to understand where investors withdraw their coins from FTX. Most market participants in the current period of uncertainty tend to choose a cold wallet as a place to store Bitcoin, Cardano ( ADA-USD ), Litecoin ( LTC-USD ), and other cryptocurrencies. The peak of the total balance of cryptocurrency exchanges was reached in 2020 when holders held about 3.2 million Bitcoins on them, but since then, the aggregate balance of BTC has only been declining. Over the past two months, there has been an enormous rate of withdrawal from exchanges as investors and traders seek to reduce the risks associated with holding digital assets on platforms, most of which do not conduct rigorous peer reviews of their accounting and financial statements. As a result of the collapse of FTX, the decline in the total balance of BTC continued to renew multi-year highs and, in my opinion, the market situation will continue for at least the next 2-3 quarters until the US regulators begin to pursue a tougher policy towards cryptocurrency exchanges. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode But despite the financial problems of the cryptocurrency exchange and the decrease in interest from investors, the Bitcoin hashrate continues to make new highs and is currently over 270 Exahash per second. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode The pressure on the crypto industry is exerted by the fact that Ethereum mining stopped at the end of the 3rd quarter of 2022, thereby reducing the interest of potential market participants in investing in cryptocurrencies. As a result, I expect that the outflow of investment interest from the industry will continue, which will also negatively affect Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ), whose video cards were massively used to mine the second most important cryptocurrency. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode With BTC's current price of $16,000, the largest investors holding more than a thousand Bitcoins in their accounts experienced unrealized losses of more than $1,800 per Bitcoin for the first time since 2020. As a result, this is unprecedented for the industry and may reduce their desire to invest in cryptocurrencies until the macroeconomic situation improves. On a larger scale, the financial problems of smaller investors also continue to worsen, as reflected in the sharp jump in realized losses over the past three years. So this week, there was a peak daily realized loss of over $1.4 billion. As a consequence, this indicates that investors continue to close their losing positions and withdraw their money from the market. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Moreover, one can observe a decrease in Bitcoin trading volumes in the futures markets, which have reached multi-year lows and are currently at $16 billion per day. As a consequence, this signals low liquidity in the trading environment, which could increase downward pressure on the price of BTC with momentum to the price range indicated in my bearish article imminently. Source: Author's elaboration, based on Glassnode Conclusion Since the end of October 2022, when my article about the prospects of the crypto industry was published, the price of Bitcoin has already fallen by more than 25%, which is somewhat higher than my expectations for the rate of its decline and the main reason for this is the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. The collapse of FTX dealt a severe blow to the industry and attracted the attention of US regulators, who will seek to tighten regulatory policies to make such situations less and less common. Unfortunately, this terrible event undermined the confidence of potential investors in cryptocurrencies. Until all the details of FTX's relationship with Alameda Research are revealed, this will continue to poison the entire industry, and the recovery period will take longer than in previous crises. During the current crypto crisis, I expect that many exchanges, including Coinbase ( COIN ), will continue to lose customers, which will lead to a decrease in trading volumes with a subsequent deterioration in their financial situation in the coming quarters. As a consequence, the collapse of FTX will not only have a negative impact on the crypto industry, but will also directly affect Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, who has invested in crypto companies. From the point of view of technical analysis, the price of Bitcoin is in a bearish trend and continues to move within the correctional wave IV. The current price of “digital gold” has a negative impact on mining companies such as Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ), Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ), which in my opinion are highly likely to resort to issuing new shares to finance their activities and buy equipment to maintain the current volume of bitcoin mining. The reasons for this are that the sale of mined coins by these companies has been happening at a price below the cost of Bitcoin for more than two months, and at the same time, network difficulty continues to grow due to increased competition in the mining industry.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559901-the-future-of-bitcoin-is-hazy-after-the-crash-of-ftx?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4647951.jpeg
42411692,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfFSt,1669143045,"What Is Zion, the Web5 Social Network App?","After Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and his team laid the foundation for the future of Web5 earlier this year, it was only a matter of time until a project was announced that employs Web5 components.  It wasn't long after Dorsey's comment that Zion, an app for creators, announced it will use a decentralized web platform from payments app Block in its second version. That brings the world closer to a social network built on Bitcoin. But how does this work, and how does it relate to Dorsey’s Bluesky social app?  What is Zion?  Zion describes itself as “an open global scalable decentralized community platform that facilitates direct flow of content and payments between creators and their audiences.” Zion was built with Web5 components and is distinct from Web3 in its core architecture and design.  See Also: What Is Web3?  Web5 is a decentralized peer-to-peer network based around decentralized web nodes and identity, using Bitcoin as the base consensus layer. Zion aims to sever the tie between social-media companies acting as the middleman between content creators and fans.  By replacing the intermediaries with vetted, open-source protocols, Zion aims to create a space for full sovereignty over your digital identity. Zion emphasizes freedom of expression and self-custody of personal information. Because Zion is built within the Web5 framework, the underlying technology enforces privacy, with no possibility of targeted advertising. Privacy and self-custody are enforced by the protocol, not by companies.  The Zion app has two primary functions: payment and community. The communities are forums that look and function like a cross between Twitter and a traditional/Facebook online forum. Zion users can use forums to share content, discuss ideas and get paid for what they contribute. Because Zion wallets operate on the Lightning Network, users and creators can instantly transact across borders.  Read More: What Is the Bitcoin Lightning Network?  Bitcoin acts as the base consensus layer for Zion, with Lightning acting as the layer 2 scaling tool. Identity on the centralized web is viewed by the Zion team as broken. Traditionally, identity is issued by external authorities who ultimately decide whose identity will be revoked, and when.  Organizations may inadvertently reveal personal information or change policies, or an individual’s identity may be replicated in the form of identity theft. In the case of Twitter, that problem was recently highlighted with the changes made for how users can receive Twitter’s blue checkmark. A formerly manual process to indicate genuine accounts on the platform was reduced to only requiring the purchase of a Twitter Blue subscription. That change resulted in confusion over identity and a decrease in trust.  Zion uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs), which solve many of the problems that make Web2 experiences from an identity perspective frustrating.  What are decentralized identifiers?  We’re hearing this term more often with regards to Dorsey’s Web5 projects and initiatives within Block (formerly Square), but the idea of decentralized identifiers extends beyond Block’s current projects and road map and widely into Web3. The plan for Zion makes more sense when understood within the context of the W3C-influenced framework and model for the future of the decentralized web.  The W3C was founded in 1994 and operates as the main international standard organization for the web as we know it today.  As defined by WC3, ""decentralized Identifiers are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity.""  Truly decentralized identification is something that both Web3 and Web5 initiatives aim to achieve, with many Ethereum blockchain-based projects looking to solve different parts of the issue.  Web5 and DID take this a step further by laying down the foundations of the core architecture, data model and the goals for operating within a sufficiently decentralized web. The key difference between Ethereum’s decentralized identity products and Web5 is planning and design. The Web5 components were built and vetted before products were built on top of them.  DIDs have been recognized as a new type of web-based identifier by the W3C, and the open standard is now recommended by the consortium after extensive technical review. That Block has W3C’s support for building Web5 and TbDEX may accelerate adoption of a decentralized web built on Bitcoin.  What are decentralized web nodes?  Zion uses decentralized web nodes (DWNs) for data storage and messaging. It allows participants to securely manage and transact their data with others without relying on a provider or location-specific infrastructure or routing.  Decentralized web nodes remain as a draft specification under development within the Decentralized Identity Foundation, and aren't yet recommended for usage by W3C.  Is Zion similar to Bluesky?  Zion’s mission is indeed similar to Bluesky, an initiative started in 2019 by Dorsey to develop a decentralized social network. Because Bluesky was created as a nonprofit owned by the team developing it, it remains unaffected by Musk’s recent acquisition of Twitter. In October 2022, Bluesky announced it is building AT Protocol, a new foundation that also incorporates the usage of DIDs as stable IDs. Bluesky has the same goal as Zion for portable accounts, privacy and decentralization.  Read More: Jack Dorsey-Backed Decentralized Social Network Bluesky Gets 30,000 Signups in 48 Hours  What’s next for Zion?  The wait list for Zion is available on its site, and the app is available to download for both iOS and Android. The product is being rolled out in stages, and there’s no news yet about when it will be available for those who sign up.

Forced selling and likely missed interest payments have severely damaged any possible investment thesis. The company will likely be out of cash by the end of 2022 barring a major recovery in Bitcoin. It's been an interesting few months for Core Scientific ( CORZ ) shareholders. The stock has been a part of a broader market sell-off in the crypto mining space, but recent releases from the firm suggest that the company may be facing bankruptcy amid cash conservation efforts. The company recently disclosed that it will not be fulfilling its debt obligations on existing equipment that are due in early November. This is amid a serious shift to unprofitability for the entire sector capped by the recent bankruptcy of FTX (FTT-USD). Forced Selling In the past, I have cautioned multiple times that forced selling for Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners at disadvantageous prices was one of the strongest signs you can get that a Bitcoin miner may be facing serious liquidity issues. Core Scientific had established a strong track record of stellar production, which bolstered its treasury, but recently the company has been liquidating its holdings in a sensational fashion. Earlier this year, the company had as many as 9600 tokens in its treasury. The update in October saw the company holding only 62 Bitcoins, which suggests serious problems. Investors have picked up on these issues, and the stock has been punished proportionally. Data by YCharts Long-term crypto bulls will be the first to remind us that we have seen Bitcoin miners recover from similar selloffs in the past, which has long been the appeal of investments in crypto miners vs. the tokens. Crypto Miners often show negative variance compared to tokens in long-term drawdowns, which provides an opportunity for outsize percentage returns when Bitcoin returns to a bullish cycle. Data by YCharts I would argue that the situation here differs from what we've seen in the past. The first distinguishing factor is the use of debt to fund operations. Interestingly, it is not impossible to find crypto miners with little to no debt. Core was a bit different as the company used a tremendous amount of debt to avoid dilution at disadvantageous prices due to its IPO happening around the time Bitcoin prices were collapsing. This meant that the Core leadership team could not raise cash from multiple secondary offerings at great prices like some of the more established mining companies. It was understandable for management to raise debt to fund operations as the previous selloffs in Bitcoin were met by strong recoveries for the past few years. This time, it would appear as though Bitcoin's collapse is a part of a broader selloff due to increasingly hawkish central banks collectively slowing down the global economy to address rampant inflation. This is somewhat ironic because Bitcoin was pitched to many as an inflation hedge but as inflation rates increased, we can see that there was no real correlation and that the tokens were more directly correlated to the NASDAQ and the broader technology sector. Data by YCharts Bankruptcy Announcement Core Scientific has announced that it may seek bankruptcy protection from its creditors in short order. The company announced in October that it expects to run out of cash before the end of the calendar year 2022 due in large part to the slump in Bitcoin prices. Apart from Bitcoin, one of the main assets that Bitcoin miners hold is their mining fleet. One could argue that apart from depreciation, the fleet would be less valuable considering the recent slump in Bitcoin prices and surging energy costs. The company also notes that it does not intend to pay interest payments on debt obligations related to their miners, which were due in late October to early November. Restructuring debt obligations is always possible, but I wouldn't be too optimistic due to the recent Bitcoin price action. For any deal to make sense, the company will likely have to get back to earning money at some point in this crypto environment makes that extremely difficult. There is likely no way out for the firm, and we will have to wait and see if the company makes it to the other side of this debt crisis. So we are left with a company with very little prospect of profitability, a very high risk of bankruptcy, and things could actually get worse. There is really no suggestion that Bitcoin prices are set to rebound anytime soon. Data by YCharts Existing shareholders are also likely carrying major losses. They will sell heavily into any favorable price action in the short to medium term, and there is a real risk that the equity could go to zero. The Takeaway Core Scientific has always been a speculative opportunity, but the odds are now firmly stacked against the company. Bitcoin prices have not been helpful, and the company is now openly discussing its liquidity challenges. We have seen multiple bankruptcies in the industry, and barring a miraculous Bitcoin recovery, we will likely see another one here. The company is exploring its options, and any significant debt restructuring agreement would likely catapult the stock, but at this point, that is wishful thinking. I would suggest that investors focus on other Bitcoin mining companies or invest in the token itself if they want to maintain bullish crypto exposure. I rate Core Scientific as an avoid .",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559894-core-scientific-likely-victim-crypto-bear-market?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4647255.jpeg

Delaware District Court Judge John Dorsey approved a motion on an interim basis allowing FTX to redact information including names and addresses on its creditor matrix during a hearing Tuesday.  Read more: Lawyers Detail the ‘Abrupt and Difficult’ Collapse of FTX in First Bankruptcy Hearing  The U.S. Trustee’s Office – the wing of the Justice Department responsible for overseeing bankruptcy proceedings – opposed part of the motion, arguing that transparency was a necessary part of the process.  Lawyers from Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm representing FTX, pushed back, arguing that it was important to protect FTX’s customers from being involuntarily disclosed as investors. They also claimed that FTX’s customer list was one of the firm’s most valuable assets and should be protected from rival exchanges.  Lawyers representing a group of FTX’s unsecured creditors seconded FTX’s motion, arguing that confidentiality and privacy are key drivers of participating in the crypto market and exposing customer information could “disincentivize participation” in the bankruptcy process and “impair the ability of creditors to recover from this case, which, of course, would be contrary to [their] best interest.”  “I need to make sure I’m protecting the interests of these individuals,” Dorsey said. “This is a space where it’s done over the internet. And everyone in this room knows the internet is wrought with potential dangers. Hacking happens, people’s accounts get hacked. And I think it’s important that we protect those individuals who are seeking to participate [in the bankruptcy process.]”  Customer accounts weren't the only accounts FTX’s lawyers were concerned about.  James Bromley of Sullivan & Cromwell told the court that FTX has continued to suffer from cyberattacks since the hack that drained hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto on the night the exchange declared bankruptcy.  “A substantial amount of assets have either been stolen or are missing,” Bromley said. “We are suffering from cyberattacks, both on the petition date and the days following.”  Bromley told the court that, under the new leadership of John Jay Ray III, FTX has retained the services of a unnamed cybersecurity firm, the identity of which hasn't been disclosed because of concerns that “those who are undertaking cyberattacks on the company and its assets will use that information to their benefit.”  Dorsey also ruled that FTX can continue to pay current employees their salaries and pay foreign and domestic vendors up to an interim cap of $1 million and $8.5 million respectively. FTX’s former leadership, including former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder Gary Wang, Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison, CEO of Alameda Research, a trading firm affiliated with FTX. Wang, Singh and Ellison were fired over the weekend and won't receive any further payments.  FTX filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on Nov. 11, as it faced a liquidity crunch following a series of events that started with a CoinDesk report that raised questions about Alameda's balance sheet.

On Sunday, November 6th, Zhao said Binance would liquidate its FTT tokens, sparking the FTX liquidity crisis. FTX's bankruptcy isn't entirely an indictment of crypto values or the future of decentralized, permissionless and trustless finance. Zhao has repeatedly implied he thought Bankman-Fried was secretly lobbying against Binance in Washington. FTX presented plans for regulation which would limit universal access to DeFi. Zhao is advocating that exchanges provide Merkle tree-style proof-of-reserves, allowing transparency and some assurance against their running a fractional reserve system. Everyone now knows FTX (FTT-USD) unraveled. The resulting liquidations, fear and justified contagion worries quickly spread to other participants and exchanges in the crypto space. The panic selling on Tuesday the 8th alone drove Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) down 11% and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) down 16%. All twenty of the largest altcoins were negative, with fifteen facing double digit declines on the day. Solana ( SOL-USD ), with its large connections to FTX, and Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) led the losers. Both were off 23%. Wednesday was worse for the most part. However, important questions remain about the details and remarkable story behind FTX's unacceptable liquidity issue and bankruptcy. Beyond just those with frozen funds, retail and institutional users across the sector have now lost confidence from the bankruptcy filing and irreparable damage has been done to sentiment. At its heart, the FTX drama is about broken trust. Binance (BNB-USD) CEO Changpeng Zhao described to CNBC what he learned from his team's due diligence during acquisition talks just prior to the bankruptcy filing. Note that the ""he"" referenced is former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. twitter.com There are also weighty implications for both U.S. and overseas regulations. As will be discussed, FTX was a leader in the crypto regulatory process and an ultra top-tier political donor in Washington. Most interestingly, a regulatory related spat was the purported match that lit the pyre at FTX. Even if FTX is eventually successfully rehabilitated like the Mt. Gox exchange , its failure is a serious blow to the crypto industry because of its prior prominence and reputation. But somewhat counterintuitively, the FTX story is not a direct indictment of the larger-cap, trustless digital assets like Bitcoin, or the trustless, on-chain DeFi seen on the Ethereum network. This is because traditional finance and centralized exchanges like FTX are intermediaries that do necessarily operate on user trust. Here that trust was obviously able to be broken. So to some degree, FTX's bankruptcy is not entirely a condemnation of crypto or of decentralized, trustless, permissionless finance, but rather a recommendation for its values. In the light of the current headlines, the idea above is rightly lost to the media and the larger market. However, it is key to recall that Bitcoin itself is a reaction to the 2007-2008 financial and monetary crisis whose hardships spurred a lack of trust in the banking system. Though now a fading memory, millions of Americans lost their homes and the crisis caused double digit unemployment in the U.S. in the following years. The negative effects of the contagion on worldwide social, economic and health security can't be overstated. The 2008 crisis finally climaxed with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September of 2008, and by October the Bitcoin Whitepaper had come out. In December Bernie Madoff, the onetime chairman and leading market maker of the NASDAQ, was arrested for a years-long Ponzi scheme that was exposed by the crisis. And the Genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain was mined in January the following year. There was now a nascent, but soon expanding, alternative to routine trust in banking, traditional finance and centralized monetary policies. Did Binance Accidently Tank FTX and Crypto? In 2017 Zhao, or ""CZ"", founded Binance, the world's largest digital asset marketplace. In 2019 Bankman-Fried, or ""SBF"", founded FTX, which was likely the world's second largest digital asset marketplace until this month. Initially Binance invested in and worked closely with FTX. In 2017 SBF also founded Alameda Research, which was a crypto trading firm. As discussed below, Alameda is a sister entity to FTX, entangled with the exchange and part of the bankruptcy filed earlier in the month. Prior to his recent notoriety, SBF was well known in the crypto sector for his philanthropy, advocacy and financial backing of other blockchain associated enterprises. For perspective, the FTX brand is now literally everywhere. They are in a strategic partnership with GameStop ( GME ), prominent FTX ambassadors included Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady, and you may have noticed during the Word Series that FTX is an official partner of MLB. In a first-of-its-kind partnership between a global sports league and a cryptocurrency exchange, the FTX patch worn by MLB umpires debuted at the '21 All-Star game and will be worn by all umpires at MLB regular season and post-season games. Source: ftx.us For some brevity, the whole history between the exchanges is not recounted here, but in 2021 Binance divested from FTX. Binance purportedly received a $2 billion mix of FTX tokens and some of their own utility and/or stable coins as payment. As an aside and for perspective, Binance's associated BNB utility token is the world's largest altcoin in terms of market cap at $45 billion, near a third the size of Ethereum. And their Paxos-issued, fully dollar-backed Binance USD ( BUSD-USD ) is the third largest stablecoin. It is complicated, but for reference, FTX's FTT circulating supply was worth about $3.3 billion last month. Over the past year Binance held the FTT from the divestiture, as is their general practice with most coins and tokens they have acquired. Binance held even though relations between the two exchanges may have been increasingly strained. My understanding, this strain related to the dynamic political and regulatory environment the crypto industry faces in multiple jurisdictions. FTX.US and Alameda research were both top 20 donators to Biden 2020. SBF testified on Capitol Hill this year and FTX actively lobbied and was a mega donor to the 2022 cycle, see graphic just below. Crazily, SBF floated the idea of donating a billion dollars in the 2024 cycle. opensecrets.org In October, SBF and FTX presented plans for regulation that conflicted in part with some of the traditional core values of the crypto sector like permissionlessness and universal access to DeFi. A number of industry insiders criticized SBF and some began to distanced themselves from him and FTX. Importantly, CZ apparently thought SBF was secretly lobbying against Binance in Washington. CZ tweeted , ""But we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs"". And reportedly SBF has joked on Twitter that CZ may not be able to come to Washington for regulation talks. The unspoken implication being CZ is persona non grata either for money laundering or his ties to China. On November 2nd CoinDesk reported on the blurred division of SBF's companies, specifically Alameda and the FTX exchange. Speaking about Alameda, CoinDesk emphasized: That balance sheet is full of FTX - specifically, the FTT token issued by the exchange that grants holders a discount on trading fees on its marketplace. While there is nothing per se untoward or wrong about that, it shows Bankman-Fried's trading giant Alameda rests on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto. The situation adds to evidence that the ties between FTX and Alameda are unusually close. Divisions... , coindesk.com, 11/2/2022 The simplified upshot, without discussing the FTT distribution regime, is that Alameda/FTX were using billions of dollars of illiquid FTT tokens as collateral for borrowings. Further, a number of high profile crypto insiders have speculated to media that Alameda was ""borrowing"" from FTX user assets for its own trading and investing. This would make sense and explain why there would be an ongoing and protracted liquidity crunch and indicative that there was not assessable 1:1 holdings by FTX. As an aside, FTX users and other FTT holders were also using the tokens as collateral. Analyst predictions of possible insolvency for Alameda and FTX quickly grew following the CoinDesk article. Four days following the article CZ indicated he would sell Binance's FTT tokens to reduce risk, but would do it slowly as to not adversely affect FTT prices. Over $500 million worth of FTT was moved onto Binance in preparation. coinmarketcap.com Alameda offered to buy the FTT from Binance over-the-counter at $22 each so as to not effect market pricing, though this deal never materialized. It has obviously been suggested CZ knew this would lead to a collapse of FTT, create liquidity issues for Alameda and possibly lead to a run on other assets at FTX. In my opinion this is unlikely and it has been disclaimed by CZ. Though not conclusive, note that CZ tweeted before the collapse began that Binance usually just held any acquired tokens and it is actually illogical to take out another exchange. We usually just hold. It removes any doubt that we would attack a ""competitor"". Not financially sensible. We want the industry to grow together. But there is a limit to hold, lol. Exit... , CZ Binance, twitter.com, 11/6/2022 We did hear some concerns about, you know, him badmouthing us behind our backs in DC... We don't focus on other smaller exchanges... Focusing our energy there does not give us the best return... Taking customers from them we may grow by 1%... If we help grow the industry we can grow by 5x... We are much more focused on how to grow the industry more. We never viewed FTX as competition , Zhao, CNBC Television, 11/17/2022 However, note below in the same tweet thread from above how CZ parallels FTT to LUNA ( LUNC-USD ), which spectacularly imploded in May taking down a number of large, leveraged crypto trading firms. Also note again that CZ seems upset about the FTX lobbying. twitter.com In any case the run was sparked and billions of dollars in value were withdrawn from the FTX exchange on the 6th and 7th. The FTT token broke though the $22 defense line late on the 7th and withdrawals on FTX International were for the most part suspended on the 8th. SBF made the following tweet thread highlighting three ideas that now appear unmeaningful: assets would be covered 1:1, surprisingly Binance had been welcomed in as an FTX acquirer and provider of liquidity following any necessary due diligence, and everything was right between him and CZ. twitter.com FTX Lesson: Trust But Verify Proof-of-Reserves After all, you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out. Warren Buffett, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY Chairman's Letter For 2001 Of course on Wednesday the 9th Binance backed out of the deal, citing reports of mishandled customer funds and U.S. based investigations of FTX. By Friday morning FTX, Alameda and FTX.US jointly filed for bankruptcy. Interestingly, on Thursday SBF returned to Twitter and included a parting shot presumably directed at CZ; SBF wrote, ""well played; you won"" and indicated he later had a few stones to throw at Binance. twitter.com 11/10/2022 Admittedly, CZ had put out a number of tweets derogatory of how FTX operated, though without mentioning them by name. The tweets center on details of how digital asset marketplaces should approach and verify their reserve system and what investors should know. The idea being that market due diligence, if given transparency, can mitigate the fact exchanges are a necessary point of trust for crypto trading. And this remains true even as investors increasingly feel comfortable with self-custody and self-custody options improve. CZ is advocating that exchanges provide Merkle tree style proof-of-reserves, allowing transparency and some assurance against their running a fractional reserve system. Binance immediately provided a basic list of their major holdings, including addresses, balances and block heights. twitter.com twitter.com CZ also commented that the space should be skeptical of large movements around a proof-of-reserves snapshot, the implication being the assets could be borrowed or shared. For those familiar with Tether ( USDT-USD ), their initial history contains evidence of similar tactics to inflate audit balances. CZ suggested that exchanges should not use their own utility tokens as collateral, take on debt, or try to deploy reserve capital for yield. twitter.com Coinbase ( COIN ) and its CEO Brian Armstrong basically agree with the Binance positions. They hold all customer assets dollar for dollar and presumably there should never be a need for a withdrawal suspension due to liquidity concerns. It should be noted that Coinbase did seek to offer a yield program for users to lend their crypto, though it was preemptively rejected during discussions with the SEC. If interested, I have an article from last October describing the program and how the Howey and Reves tests could be applied to it; it can be found here . Coinbase has higher fees and less offerings than their offshore peers. But the added level of comfort provided by their U.S. incorporation, public company listing, and longstanding focus on security and trust will drive user adoption during the next crypto bull cycle. And interestingly, they don't have a low utility exchange token to cause concern. Though I don't currently have a buy rating on Coinbase, consider reading Coinbase: Be Convinced But Be Patient o r Coinbase: Darkest Before The Dawn where the company's troubled revenue stream is weighed against its expense profile improvements and fortress balance sheet. twitter.com twitter.com The proof-of-reserves ideas Binance is suggesting and public audits Coinbase supports should provide the sector needed transparency into the exchange intermediaries sitting between traditional finance and decentralized digital assets. These practices can provide some insight into who is swimming naked, even during the high tide of the next bull cycle. Stablecoin legislation may possibly still be addressed first and separately in the U.S. Congress. But then look for a more omnibus crypto bill, including regulations covering centralized exchanges, to follow later next year. One focus will likely surround proof-of-reserves and liabilities and custody reporting for these marketplaces. Two Final Thoughts On FTX Of the majors, Solana has been the biggest loser from the FTX fallout, down by over half. A week ago Friday Seeking Alpha contributor Mike Fay had a comprehensive piece discussing the FTX connections to Solana and general concerns about the total value locked on the blockchain. The Solana Foundation also provided a detailed blog of their connections to FTX and Alameda. Most concerning is the uncertainty caused by the relatively large amount of currently locked coins associated with Alameda. How in the coming years these unlocking coins will affect both price and the staking mechanism needs to be further scrutinized and gamed out. solana.com Beyond the main points concerning trust and proof-of-reserves, or the details of how FTX specifically affects different projects like Solana, my final takeaway is more broad. Depending on one's risk profile and allocation strategy, now may be an opportune time to be averaging into the stronger networks and platforms leading the decentralization and blockchain technology revolution. Today is kind of the opposite of a FOMO moment, a moment of true fear in the sector. And based on timing of previous cycles, the coming months should find a bottom and stabilization of prices. BTC Price - Log Scale investor.coinbase.com When asked about his $500 million loss in the '87 crash, Walmart ( WMT ) founder Sam Walton famously opined, ""Its paper anyway...."" The idea being his stores would still open, his trucks would still run, and his team and customers had not really changed in proportion to the loss. Bitcoin's total network hash rate remains near all time highs, over 260 EH/s. This is indicative of low efficiency miners remaining ""cost of goods"" profitable or at least break-even. So from a security perspective the Bitcoin network and ledger still appear strong at current pricing and with 17 months between now and the next point of stress from the halving event. twitter.com/VitalikButerin Development on the Ethereum platform continues and core contributors have recently revised the roadmap (see above), including a new upgrade line called ""The Scourge"" that addresses growing centralization and censorship issues. The promise of trustless, permissionless smart contracts is healthy. This seems especially true when also looking at the larger-cap altcoins that were somewhat siloed from FTX, such as Cardano ( ADA-USD ). Cardano developments, like the Vasil upgrade and next year's USDA stablecoin launch, should empower growing participation in its smart contracts. Despite the FTX damage, the show goes on. My new marketplace service is coming soon.

The U.S.-based financial services firm now allows companies to offers its digital assets account as part of their 401(k) line up, a Fidelity spokesperson told CoinDesk in a statement. Fidelity’s retirement accounts are big business: The company had an estimated $2.4 trillion in 401(k) assets in 2020, or more than a third of the total U.S. market at that time, according to research firm Cerulli Associates.  The senators – Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) – had previously expressed their trepidation over the plan in July, and the Department of Labor had expressed similar concerns in April.  ""The ill-advised, deceptive and potentially illegal actions of a few have a direct impact on the valuation of bitcoin and other digital assets,"" according to this latest letter.  Already deep in a bear market, bitcoin (BTC) has fallen even further since the FTX exchange collapse earlier this month, touching a two-year low below $15,500 on Monday.

42394094,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXWKD,1669140420,What Do You Really Own in the Ownership Economy?,"The blockchain is the future. That’s what we’re told anyway. If you’ve heard of the blockchain, you’ve probably also heard its proponents talking about the utopian ideal of decentralized ownership.  Decentralized ownership goes way beyond monkey jpegs: Some companies are predicting – and promising – ownership of everything from houses to television and media networks, all on the blockchain.  While the future seems exciting, promises like these and the utopian picture many people paint bring me to one central question: What do you actually own in the ownership economy?  The answer is more complicated than you might think.  Nick Ducoff is a partner at G20 Ventures, a co-founder of ON_Discourse and a founding member of OurNextDAO.  NFTs  Many people assume owning a non-fungible token means you own the associated asset – in reality, all you can prove you own in many cases is the tokenID and contract address. The legal right to control the item may or may not be intrinsically part of the NFT.  Copyright law introduces additional complexity: Transferring ownership does not inherently transfer copyright. U.S. copyright law has stringent requirements for transferring copyright, which are not guaranteed to be met by smart contracts.  When purchasing an NFT, many people assume they’re buying the work it represents. The reality is a little more complex. In fact, when you purchase an NFT, what you actually own is the token’s metadata (including its tokenID and the contract address) – not necessarily the work itself.  Furthermore, the token doesn’t actually reside in your wallet, but rather the token’s ledger is updated to reflect that your wallet owns one. This introduces a number of issues related to ownership and copyright.  See also: What You Own When You Own an NFT | Opinion  Physical objects and ownership  Say you buy an NFT associated with a physical object. What you have definitely purchased is the tokenID and contract address connected to that physical item. Other assets, like the physical object itself and whether you have the legal right to control the item, may or may not be intrinsically part of the NFT.  Buying an NFT representing a physical object doesn’t guarantee that you will receive the goods. Purchasing the NFT doesn’t trigger a process wherein a robot fulfills and ships an order from a warehouse, for example. There’s a human in the loop.  And if the order isn’t fulfilled, the blockchain remains immutable. You can’t get a chargeback as you could with a purchase you made using a credit card. You’re just SOL (no pun intended).  Copyright confusion  It gets even more complicated when the NFT is connected to a digital creative work, in part because of rampant confusion about the relationship between NFTs and copyright law – and specifically U.S. copyright law, which sets a high bar for selling copyright.  If you purchase an NFT of a digital creative work – let’s say a piece of visual art that someone else created – you have, once again, definitely purchased the tokenID and contract address for the artwork. What’s murkier is figuring out who has the ability to create (and profit from) derivatives or copies of that art.  Part of the confusion comes from the fact that, under U.S. copyright law, there is a difference between transferring a copy of something (like a piece of art) and transferring copyright (as in, the right to make other copies of that art). Transferring copyright requires that the transfer occurs in writing, with a signature from the copyright owner – something smart contracts can make surprisingly difficult.  Let’s say, as an example, that Person A creates a piece of digital art. Person B buys an NFT, acquiring full ownership of the copyright as part of the original contract. At some point, Person B decides to sell the NFT.  What happens when Person C buys it? Does copyright automatically transfer to them? Not necessarily! If the smart contract does not specifically include mention of copyright transfer, Person B might still legally hold the copyright – even if Person C now has the NFT.  And what happens if Person B created a ton of derivative material around their NFT before they sold it? Do those revenue streams go with the NFT to Person C, or do they remain with Person B, the copyright holder?  There’s no crystal clear answer to those questions, and yet the legal and financial ramifications of those answers are significant.  Read more: The End of the 'Centralization Era' in Crypto | Opinion  Legal ramifications  The promise of NFTs is that of a form of true digital ownership entirely counter to the current model of licensing and streaming (in which buying something like a song, book, or movie online does not mean you truly own that digital item, much less its copyright).  However, the legal landscape of copyright and ownership – especially where digital assets are concerned – has not yet adjusted to NFTs and other Web3-related assets. Nor do all NFT sellers seem to fully abide by the ethos of true digital ownership.  One article on NFTs and digital property in the Indiana Law Journal notes that while Axie Infinity, for example, sells “axies … on the grounds that they are owned and may be resold for profit,” Axie’s actual license asserts that the company still has copyright control. As the author points out, the inconsistencies between what buyers are told and what’s in the licensing agreement make for an unstable market and legal environment. The legal issues here are complex and thorny.  Vanishingly few existing NFT projects have been released with explicit copyright terms baked into the smart contract and, as in the case of Axie, there can be conflicts between what the buyer thinks they’re getting and the licensing terms. The potential for expensive, complicated legal issues down the line is real, and it’s likely that many such cases will be litigated in court in the coming years.  What this means in a practical sense now is that when you purchase an NFT, it’s entirely possible that the only things you actually own are the tokenID and contract address. Everything else, unless explicitly spelled out, is very much a gray area.  Governance tokens  A governance token makes you a decision-maker – but does it make you an owner of that organization? It’s unclear how governance tokens define the relationship of rights and accountability between token holders and organizations. Governance tokens might be considered securities or equity, but that definition remains murky for many token holders.  Bad actors can manipulate governance tokens and technical loopholes to cause significant financial damage.  When you receive a governance token, you also gain the right to vote on governance questions – holding the token makes you a decision-maker within the organization that issued it. But does it make you an owner?  In a more typical corporate organization, if you purchased shares of a company in the form of securities or were issued them as stock options, you might be considered a shareholder, depending on the organization’s structure and your connection to it.  Shareholders have certain rights based on state law and common law from years of court precedent, especially in Delaware. While governance tokens are not equity in a literal sense, they are often regarded as being similar to more traditionally understood forms of equity.  However, in the Web3 space, there are no widespread, commonly agreed upon mechanisms for holding people accountable the way there are in a company with shareholders, a board of directors and management teams.  Much of the excitement about Web3 is about doing away with unnecessary hierarchy – but in this case, what’s important isn’t that hierarchy. It’s the relationship between ownership (like stock) and accountability.  See also: The Pitfalls of 'Community-as-Company' | Opinion  Shares vs. governance tokens  To take just one example, let’s say you own one IBM share. That means you own one share’s worth of IBM and are a shareholder (and likely a shareholder who expects the value to increase).  The more shares you own, the more weight your voice will carry when it comes time for IBM to make decisions. Also, you get one share of dividends. There are also systems in place to ensure IBM’s actions are held accountable to its shareholders.  However, if what you own is a governance token, there are no such guarantees of accountability, no clear indication of whether you can expect your token to be exchangeable for value, and no well-defined sense of what holding that token really means.  This leads to another set of questions, the answers to which are often equally unclear, such as:  Is a governance token a security?  Is it a claim on the treasury?  What liquidity is available, and what will continue to be available?  Does owning a token confer governance of the specific product/project, the whole organization or both?  What happens if the organization is “wrapped” – that is, if there’s an LLC or corporate structure on top?  Is a governance token transferable?  Market manipulation  Questions about governance tokens and what you own are already complex, and the fun doesn’t stop there. It’s also possible for bad actors to manipulate governance tokens and decentralized structures in incredibly harmful ways.  Mango Markets, for example, experienced a painful market manipulation. Exploiters found loopholes in the smart contract that allowed them to dramatically increase the value of their collateral and siphon money from the Mango Markets treasury in the form of loans – to the tune of more than $100 million.  Not only that, but one of the exploiters went on to offer to settle bad debt using the stolen funds and used stolen tokens to vote for their own proposal.  While they lacked sufficient tokens to pass the proposal, this type of market manipulation and exploitation makes it imperative to answer questions about what you truly own when you own a governance token.  So, what do you own?  As you think through these issues – and these are just a handful of examples from an increasingly complex landscape – you might find yourself wondering whether the ownership economy is actually a mirage.  What do you actually own? In too many cases, there is no clear answer to this question, and there’s plenty of ambiguity when answers do exist.  The ownership economy is not currently what it’s made out to be. Rather than a utopia of decentralized ownership, we see increasingly complex legal questions with increasingly high financial stakes.  Reversibility  Fortunately, there are ways we can start addressing that complexity. Reversibility, for example, is something to consider.  Right now, the market has a major caveat emptor hanging over it – and while buyers should be aware of what they’re purchasing, too few have real access to the information they need. Although the blockchain’s immutability is one of its selling points, there are proposals for reversibility that work with the blockchain while offering recourse to consumers.  One such proposal focuses on ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, and suggests a short reversal dispute period during which decentralized panels of judges determine whether or not a transaction should be reversed.  Information disclosure  Another element to think about is ensuring more information is available for buyers. It should be possible to list information in the transaction to spell out exactly what it is you’re getting when you make a purchase. Easy access to the rights and licensing information associated with a token, for example, will help buyers understand exactly what their token enables them to do.  The ownership economy is a promising space. But right now, those promises are not being fulfilled. Legal and market realities are clashing and high-profile scandals are drawing attention to shortcomings in the system. What’s presented as utopia looks more like a pipe dream, if the headlines are anything to go by.  However, it’s not too late to get closer to that utopian ideal. It will take work, and likely quite a lot of legal wrangling, but there are opportunities to ensure everyone who enters the ownership economy knows exactly what they own.",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Nick Ducoff,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/22/what-do-you-really-own-in-the-ownership-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29543141fd0fb25389077a25347d453ac08549a3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

FTX implosion puts even more immediate pressure on the company. Management can't cut costs fast enough. Basic Thesis For anyone who doesn't know, Coinbase ( COIN ) offers customers a platform to trade cryptocurrencies. Think of it as a brokerage for crypto where clients can trade and custody their holdings or hold cash. The company was an early mover in the space when trading and holding crypto was more onerous. As a result, the company earned incredibly fat commissions for trading (percent of trade value rather than flat dollars per trade) and high margins for other services. As cryptocurrencies proliferated and prices soared, the company grew revenues quickly and hired aggressively to capture even more growth. I believe we are seeing the downside of the crypto growth curve, better and cheaper competition for trading volumes, the decline of the company's highest margin products and a bloated cost structure that management will struggle to cut fast enough to offset declining revenues. The biggest threat to COIN right now in my opinion is the company's cost to trade, or what is commonly referred to as take-rate. Putting it bluntly, COIN's fees for retail traders are pretty egregious, ranging from 0.50-1.49%. This compares to competitors like Interactive Brokers ( IBKR ), who charge 0.12-0.18%. Moreover, institutional investors on COIN, who use a service called Coinbase Prime, get an even better deal. The company likes to tout the growth of institutional investors on its platform, but given they put lower commissions and potentially trade less frequently, to date institutions have not been big revenue contributors. Another big hit to the company is the meltdown of altcoins (e.g., coins other than Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) which has accelerated with the implosion of FTX (FTT-USD). Altcoin trading represented 36% of trading volume in Q3 but 45% of total revenue at COIN. I believe we will see both declines in altcoin trading volume and take rate. Coinbase Trading Volumes (Q3 Earnings Supplement) One bright spot the company likes to point to is subscription revenue, which has been growing. However, the biggest part of this subscription growth is interest income, which is basically income the company has been earning on cash left in customer accounts. While it's certainly possible clients will leave cash in these accounts, I seriously doubt that customers will leave it there for long if they don't get a fair interest rate. Coinbase Quarterly Revenues (Q3 Earnings Supplement) I have heard the argument that the demise of FTX will lead to market share gains by companies like COIN. I think there is some merit to that but not enough to offset revenue pressures. Moreover, beyond the potential of competition and lower fees from other brokerages, there is the potential from competition from decentralized exchanges like Uniswap (UNI-USD). These decentralized exchanges have far fewer employees and therefore far lower cost structures than COIN. These decentralized exchanges have seen similar trading volumes to COIN since FTX blew up. Valuation As one can see from the volatility and composition of net revenue above, it is really hard to pin down a topline number. Expenses are easier but still not particularly easy either given what the company has done the past few quarters. Coinbase Operating Expenses (Q3 Earnings Supplement) With such volatile top lines and expense lines, coming up with EBITDA and cash flows are very difficult. However, consistent with COIN CFO's warning on Q3 conference call, I believe that both transaction and subscription revenues will be pressured going forward (even assuming higher interest rates on higher cash balances). The company is pledging to cut cost, but there is a lot of wood to chop there. As such, I see a strong possibility that the company will be both EBITDA and cash flow negative for the foreseeable future. Against that backdrop, I see the company's $9.5 billion market cap as highly at risk, even after the major price declines the stock has already seen and a relatively high short interest. Risks Given that 18% short interest as a percentage of float, this stock can rally very hard, very fast. For example, the stock popped after mediocre Q3 earnings just on the back of slightly higher-than-expected transactions and the prospect of cost cuts. This volatility is a price to pay for the short or owning puts. I think the trends make it worthwhile, but the volatility needs to be taken into account. Furthermore, if Bitcoin and Ethereum rally, you could see the stock pop too even though I think the company's fortunes are in trouble no matter what happens to the major coins. Conclusion I think this short bet works for a number of reasons: declining altcoin volumes, take rate pressure, customers moving cash out of their accounts, and competition from retail brokerages and decentralized exchanges. One needs some resolve and an iron stomach to hold puts or the stock short, but I see this business in terminal decline with commensurate negative EBITDA and cash flows.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559877-coinbase-multiple-melting-points-crypto-winter?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4645904.jpeg

The prices of most of the crypto assets have been tolling to the south beyond expectation. In addition, the entire market is experiencing a decline due to the collapse of the FTX exchange. Related Reading: These Bitcoin Metrics Signal A Capitulation Event Is Near The outcome of the recent events has raised more doubts in the crypto space. Bitcoin is dipping drastically and has gone below the $16K region. However, the altcoins are not left in the bearish trend. Lots of the assets have gone below their critical resistance levels, signifying a potential emergence of draught in the crypto market. Following the continuous decline, the crypto market has lost about $60 billion in just two days. This has pushed the cumulative market cap to dip below $800 billion. The value sits at $785.71 billion at the press time, indicating a 1.53% drop over the past 24 hours. For the past fortnight since the FTX fiasco, the crypto market has lost approximately $300 billion. This brought the market cap down from its coveted region of $1 trillion. Bitcoin Price Drops The performance of the primary cryptocurrency has been less impressive in the declining crypto market. Bitcoin has failed to surpass the limitation at the $17K region throughout last week. Without volatility, the weekend was suppressive for the token as it stagnated around $16,6000 for two consecutive days. Monday marked a different dimension for Bitcoin as the token price dropped to $16K. Gradually, BTC has been moving to the south to finally hit a new two-year low of $15,660. A blockchain analytics firm, Glassnode, reported that Bitcoin’s current price had caused unrealized losses for whales. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $16,142, marking a growth. Its market cap is $308.23 billion, and its dominance over altcoins is 38.69%. Altcoins Stuck In The Bad Trend The story is not different for the altcoins as well. Ethereum has suffered in the prevailing situation. The past 48 hours saw a loss in value for the second-largest crypto asset. Though Ether was slightly above the $1,200 level on Sunday, the token has plummeted since Monday. Related Reading: XRP Price Holds Ground While BTC and ETH Slide, Here’s Breakout Zone ETH has finally hit a new multi-week low as it went below $1,100 during early trading hours of today, November 22. At the time of writing, Ethereum is hovering sideways around $1,121. Other altcoins with smaller daily declines include Cardano, Binance Coin, Polygon, Dogecoin, Tron, Shiba Inu, and Polkadot. However, Chainlink and Litecoin have recorded some gains despite the trending decline in the market. The two tokens witnessed up to a 3% surge over the past 24 hours.

42414836,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBN1y5,1669137256,Lawyers Detail the ‘Abrupt and Difficult’ Collapse of FTX in First Bankruptcy Hearing,"“You have witnessed probably one of the most abrupt and difficult collapses in the history of corporate America,” an attorney for FTX said during the company’s first bankruptcy hearing in Delaware on Tuesday.  James Bromley of Sullivan and Cromwell, representing FTX, detailed the company’s rise and collapse in a brief presentation during the hearing, explaining how the company fell apart within the course of two weeks after a CoinDesk report showed that Alameda Research, a subsidiary of the overall FTX group, held an unexpectedly large amount of FTT tokens, issued by FTX itself.  There are over 100 different debtors tied to the FTX group that filed for bankruptcy, another attorney said.  Bromley called the case an “unprecedented matter,” tacitly acknowledging the chaos of FTX’s bankruptcy, which saw a hack the night it filed for bankruptcy and several days before typical first-day filings were available.  The new team at FTX, including new CEO John Ray III, has “assembled a team of investigators,” which includes former enforcement officials with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and former prosecutors, Bromley said. FTX has also retained crypto analytics firm Chainalysis to help it investigate the company’s holdings.  Bromley also acknowledged the number of investigations into FTX.  ""We have received requests I would say – some might say demands – from the U.S. Congress, both from the Senate and the House [of Representatives] to have Mr. Ray appear during the month of December,” he said.  The House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Agricultural Committee have both announced hearings into FTX’s collapse next month.  ‘Personal fiefdom’  Bromley described the FTX empire – at its height valued at $32 billion – as the “personal fiefdom of Sam Bankman-Fried,” the former CEO of the exchange. The lawyer told the court that Bankman-Fried and a small group of executives ran the company “with a lack of corporate controls that none of us in the profession … have ever seen.”  The attorney questioned some of FTX’s expenditures, saying that one of the U.S. entities spent around $300 million on real estate in the Bahamas – homes and vacation homes for members of FTX’s leadership team.  Bromley said that when Bankman-Fried reluctantly handed over the reins to FTX’s new CEO, former Enron cleanup man John Jay Ray III, it allowed those left at the company to, “for the first time, really see under the covers and recognize that the emperor had no clothes.”  Though Bromley did not identify Bankman-Fried by name, he told the court that FTX “was in the control of a small group of inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals, and unfortunately, the evidence seems to indicate that some or all of them are also compromised individuals.”  “A substantial amount of [FTX’s] assets have either been stolen or are missing,” Bromley said.",NEGATIVE,FTT,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH | FTT,"Nikhilesh De, Cheyenne Ligon",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/22/lawyers-detail-the-abrupt-and-difficult-collapse-of-ftx-in-first-bankruptcy-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fee09da08bb545ea79d05c45c0b50a0264af4630-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414821,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBN171,1669136787,Bahamas FTX Liquidators Agree to Transfer Bankruptcy Case to Delaware,"Court-appointed liquidators overseeing collapsed crypto exchange FTX's assets in the Bahamas have agreed to transfer a related case they'd filed in New York to Delaware, where the company had already filed for bankruptcy protection.  While the embattled company FTX Trading Ltd. had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on Nov. 11, the Bahamian liquidators later filed a Chapter 15 suit in the Southern District of New York for FTX Digital Markets, one of the companies under the broader FTX umbrella and the name of the entity located in The Bahamas. The liquidators at the time said FTX, which was headquartered in the Bahamas, was not allowed to file for bankruptcy in the U.S.  Before reaching an agreement on the transfer of the case, FTX filed a complaint seeking a court order to make the liquidators file their Chapter 15 case, which targets cross-border insolvency, in Delaware.  ""We had filed with your Honor a motion to transfer that case from the Southern District of New York to the district of Delaware, and we are pleased to report that we have reached an agreement with the joint provisional liquidators to do just that to bring the case from New York and here to Delaware,"" James Bromley, a partner in Sullivan & Cromwell’s Finance and Restructuring Group said during the first FTX bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday.  But the agreement doesn't necessarily mean everything is rosy between what's left of FTX and regulators in the Bahamas. In FTX's filing opposing the liquidators' complaint, it said it had evidence the government of the Bahamas had directed unauthorized access to FTX assets after FTX had filed for bankruptcy.  Bromley reiterated during his Tuesday presentation that FTX was in possession of evidence showing that ""there have been movement of assets out of the debtors' estates to the Bahamas.""

Sales for the Saudi Arabia-themed non-fungible token (NFT) collection called “The Saudis” increased 387% on Tuesday following the country’s surprise 2-1 win against Argentina, which is considered one of the best soccer teams in the world.  Argentina’s fan token (ARG), in contrast, dropped 21% over the past 24 hours and is trading at $5.44 as of press time, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The South American team, led by Lionel Messi, was the clear favorite going into Monday’s match.  Crypto tokens have become popular among gamblers in this year’s World Cup. Chiliz (CHZ), the native token of the Chiliz blockchain that powers Socios.com, the largest sports fan token creator platform, surged 39% in the week before the start of the competiton as fans basked in a fresh wave of hype.  However, the hype died down quickly and other fan tokens, including those of Portugal (POR) and Brazil (BFT) all declined after Monday and underperformed both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  “Big events often present big opportunities for traders,” Priyansh Patel of Delphi Digital wrote on Monday. “Some market participants begin positioning a few weeks before the actual event in order to take profits when the event occurs.” The World Cup, he wrote, was no exception and fan tokens “experienced hefty corrections just two days before the event began.”  Read more: Sports Fan Tokens Rally Ahead of FIFA World Cup, Defying Crypto Market Gloom",POSITIVE,BTC | CHZ,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | CHZ,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/22/saudi-arabias-nft-collection-soars-after-unexpected-soccer-win-against-argentina,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b96894babac7e7fc49b8795f765b815ee2c33516-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The policy, provided by insurance marketplace Lloyd’s of London, will allow Aegis to insure up to $25 million for tokenized assets held by institutional investors, hedge funds and exchanges.  As the NFT market continues to ride out an extended crypto winter, digital asset insurance remains a topic of discussion. In March, insurance company IMA set up its office in Decentraland to offer protection for tokenized assets. And in the wake of crypto exchange FTX’s collapse, there appears to be heightened interest in keeping digital assets safe.  Serra Wei, CEO of Aegis Trust, told CoinDesk that lack of regulation and protection has led customers to lose their assets and prompted the company to roll out a custodial product targeting NFTs. Aegis currently offers a fully customizable white-label solution to build a complete custodial NFT Marketplace  “We are focusing on the security of the infrastructure. And that's really fundamental for institutions, which are still the majority of the value that has come into the crypto market,” Wei told CoinDesk. “Being able to put that layer on top of what we already offer to clients I think is critical.”  In August, the company teamed up with Coinbase Cloud to provide custody and staking for Evmos (the EVM hub launched on Cosmos) and Avalanche.  Over the past years, the company has continued to scale its asset custody and digitization offerings with regulation in mind. In December 2020, Aegis Trust obtained regulatory approval from the South Dakota Division of Banking to establish its trust.

The program will allocate $10 million to three different types of Web3 funding and collaborations.  Two programs have unlimited pools of ecosystem and research grants. The third is an eight-week incubator program for 30 early-stage projects or startups, which includes up to $300,000 in funding. Gitcoin, a crowdfunding platform, will share incentives and partner with FV to build collaborations and mentorships.  “We are particularly interested in projects that offer solutions to help scale [the crypto] industry for mainstream adoption,” Tony Cheng, general partner at Foresight Ventures, said in a press release. The grant application process is scheduled to open at the end of this year.  Prior to the recent downfall of FTX, which is still sending shockwaves throughout the crypto industry, Web3 funding in general had been dropping. There was around $3.3 billion in startup funding in the third quarter of this year, a nearly 50% drop compared with the second quarter, according to Crunchbase data. In 2021, almost $9.3 billion was invested in the final quarter of the year.  Despite the latest tsunami of sobering crypto news and trends, Foresight Ventures considers the period an opportunity to build. “We understand very well that bear markets are periods of massive innovation and growth,” co-founder Forest Bai said in the press release. The program will prioritize projects at every stage of development, “to accelerate” the crypto industry’s evolution.  Established in 2020, Foresight Ventures has invested in Web3, non-fungible token, gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Last year, AUM increased to $400 million from $80 million following FV's acquisition of Singapore-based exchange and trading platform, BitGet, and its limited partnership with BitKeep, a multi-chain digital wallet in Asia.

Among the celebrities that endorsed FTX US, FTX's American division, were Tom Brady, the football quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry. The regulator is investigating payments received by them as well as what exactly was being promoted, what disclosures were made and how retail investors were able to access those disclosures, Joe Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board, told Bloomberg in an interview.

42414833,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBN1iA,1669134541,"CFTC Bypassed Legal Requirement in Trying to Serve Ooki DAO, Crypto Supporters Claim","The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is trying to “create [a] novel precedent” for itself in trying to serve a lawsuit to the entirety of a decentralized autonomous organization, rather than to the DAO’s members, one of three filings pushing back against the agency’s lawsuit said.  The filings, published Monday, are responses to the CFTC’s earlier pushback against the amicus briefs filed by crypto legal consortium LeXpunK, venture-capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm and the DeFi Education Fund.  The CFTC sued Ooki DAO in September, alleging the organization illegally offered crypto derivatives products to U.S. customers. The CFTC made similar allegations against bZeroX, a company that acted as a predecessor to Ooki.  The four original briefs argued that the CFTC’s method of serving notice on Ooki DAO’s members – which was done by posting a notice in a DAO-run forum and via a chatbot on the DAO’s website – was unlawful, and DAO members affected by the lawsuit should have been notified directly.  Because of the unorthodox nature of the notice, the CFTC had to ask the California judge overseeing the case to approve its methods. The briefs say the judge should reconsider.  The CFTC pushed back in its own filing last week, claiming that because the DAO was clearly aware of the lawsuit (its members discussed it in the DAO forum and on the DAO’s official Twitter account posted about it), notice had been properly served.  But the new briefs now say that isn't enough.  Andreessen Horowitz said in its brief Monday that the CFTC didn't describe any efforts it had made to identify members of the DAO. Under California state law, the regulator would have to try to identify individuals to serve, the filing said.  Much of the filing focuses on that argument, detailing why the venture fund believes the CFTC has failed to meet legal requirements for serving Ooki.  The arguments made by Andreesen Horowitz’s lawyers echo those of the DeFi Education Fund, which attempt to convince the court that the CFTC didn't properly serve notice and that allowing the federal regulator to skirt existing legal requirements just because the technology involved in the case is novel could risk the Constitutional right to due process.  LeXpunK alleges that the CFTC hasn't even proven that Ooki is an “unincorporated association” under the law.  “The CFTC relies upon a razor-thin metaphysical distinction between the Ooki DAO and Ooki Protocol. According to the CFTC, the Ooki Protocol is software. In contrast, (per the CFTC) the Ooki DAO is ‘a group of users of the Ooki Protocol who (a) chose not to incorporate, and (b) both held and actually voted governance tokens to participate in the business of running the Ooki Protocol pursuant to specific, publicized governance protocols.’ The CFTC claims that it ‘is not a novel proposition’ that individuals who use the same software can be deemed members of an unincorporated association by virtue of that software use. Not only is this a novel proposition, it is unprecedented. It would likely surprise Microsoft Word users to learn that editing the same document as another person is enough to form an unincorporated association,” LeXpunK said.  Paradigm didn't file a response to the CFTC’s motion by the Monday deadline.

Though some speculators might chalk this up to economic concerns and now the collapse of FTX, the issues affecting Bitcoin are far deeper. At the end of the day, the cryptocurrency deserves to fall far further from here since it is nearly worthless. So far, 2022 is not proving to be a particularly good year for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Although, to be fair, it's not looking to be great for most any cryptocurrency or any investment in general. Unlike most investment opportunities though, Bitcoin is distinguished by the fact that, at the end of the day, I think it's destined to see its price plunge. For years, cryptocurrency in general has been hyped up. In addition to the general enthusiasm that is common with new and rapidly expanding technologies, Bitcoin has benefited from an environment of low interest rates and almost nonexistent regulatory oversight. But with interest rates rising, economic conditions worsening, and significant pain caused by a lax regulatory environment now becoming headline news, I truly believe the best days for Bitcoin and, cryptocurrency in general, are in the past. Not entirely worthless... but not far off Although this article could be used for cryptocurrency in general, I recognize that there is a tremendous amount of variation between cryptocurrencies that don't make them exactly comparable with one another. So instead of having this content directed at all cryptocurrencies in what would ultimately fail to account for the tremendous variety that exists on the market, my overall focus will be primarily on Bitcoin. For a long time now, I have thought of Bitcoin as being more or less worthless. This is not to say that it has no value. Clearly, there is a financial benefit to being able to transfer money from one part of the world to another in an instant and with limited cost. What that specific amount should be is up for the market to decide. But I believe the notion that there would be significant value behind Bitcoin in general that would justify prices in the tens of thousands of dollars is absurd. While I do not believe that Bitcoin is entirely worthless, I do believe that its overall value is severely limited compared to what the current market has been assessing it to be. After all, it's the valuable blockchain technology, not the cryptocurrency itself, that transfers the money from one point to another. I have no doubt that those who are bullish about cryptocurrency will disagree with my view. There are a number of arguments that can be made in favor of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in particular. One common refrain is that it behaves as a store of value. But what is value at the end of the day? When it comes to stocks, the value in question is not the ticker symbol that you purchased. Instead, it's the ownership stake over the assets of the enterprise, with the ultimate value theoretically determined by all of that company's future cash flows, discounted to the present day. Instead of comparing Bitcoin to stocks, and more common way of justifying its value is by likening the cryptocurrency to precious metals like gold or silver. After all, they do have a lot in common. Like gold and silver, Bitcoin can be exchanged for cash. It has an active market that allows prices to be determined from moment to moment. Furthermore, just like gold and silver, Bitcoin does have a finite limit to it. But when you really dig down, these points either truly don't matter or the comparison is flawed entirely. Take, for instance, the idea of an active market with moment-to-moment pricing. Any commodity boasts the same thing. But at the end of the day, you don't see pork prices or wheat prices derive their value from the fact that they are uniform to the point of being easily priced. Instead, it's their ultimate utility, as well as the supply/demand balance, that matters. And when it comes to the finite argument, while Bitcoin itself may be limited, the overall number of cryptocurrencies is rising rapidly. Today, there are well over 20,000 cryptocurrencies globally, with over 12,000 that are not regularly circulated . Some might argue that gold and silver act as a store of value only because we have chosen them to be that. By this logic, anything, even digital currency, could be made the same way if enough people adopt it to be so. I would counter this point with the argument that the fact that gold and silver are perceived as stores of value is secondary in importance. Using data from 2019 for the US, only about 8% of all gold was used for the production of official coins. A whopping 50% went toward jewelry, while 37% was used in electronics. That left another 5% for other miscellaneous purposes. When it comes to silver, the most common use involves electronics. An impressive 35% of silver goes to that space. 25% goes to a combination of coins and medals. 24% goes to other miscellaneous categories, while 10% is attributable to photography and 6% is dedicated to jewelry and silverware. So yes, both of these precious metals may be used as stores of value. But at the end of the day, their value is derived primarily from their utility. When you can wear a Bitcoin around your neck that your great grandparent bought or mined, or use it to make your camera work or your computer function, perhaps that picture might change. Data by YCharts When trying to promote Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, some individuals will point to the U.S. dollar and other fiat currencies. But there are a couple of problems here when it comes to comparison as well. Bitcoin is promoted as a store of value, something that the dollar is not. Over time, the dollar gradually loses its value because of its very nature. And second, any value baked into the dollar is driven by numerous forces that cryptocurrency cannot replicate. Sure, there are always market forces that determine the exchange rate from one currency to another. But at the end of the day, the dollar's value is backed by the U.S. government's ability to tax individuals and organizations, as well as by a massive military complex. It certainly helps that much of global trade, including the vast majority of international petroleum transactions, use the dollar. Data by YCharts Bitcoin also lacks the kind of stability you would expect from a true store of value. Any asset can experience some volatility. But consider how gold has been over the years. During the worst downturn the precious metal experienced in recent memory, prices dropped by 40.3%. This was between early September of 2012 and January 1st of 2016. But for the most part, gold has experienced a steady increase in price over the years. By looking at a chart that includes $10,000 invested in Bitcoin compared to $10,000 invested in the S&P 500, you would see that Bitcoin has behaved much more like a speculative bubble. Not just a speculative bubble, but one that is in the process of bursting. This year alone, while the S&P 500 is down 16.8%, Bitcoin has plunged 64.1%. From its high, the cryptocurrency has fallen 72.3%. Data by YCharts In the past, there have been other speculative bubbles. These are sometimes defined as periods of time where an asset or assets are pushed up in price well above their intrinsic value, only to eventually collapse. The oldest example on record is commonly referred to as Tulipmania . In the 16th century, tulips first began appearing throughout Europe, arriving via the spice trading routes that had been established not long before. Beginning with the wealthy, tulips became viewed as high-class items and the demand for them grew as the middle class sought to emulate the wealthier members of society. Wall Street Club Beginning in 1634, a mania involving tulips swept through Holland. Specific accounts of exactly how bad the bubble was have been justifiably questioned. Some economic historians believe that some of the tales told have been embellished or made up entirely. But by some accounts, the rarest variety of tulip bulbs rose in price to the point of reaching upwards of $1 million in today's money. This was not a bubble that disappeared rapidly. It wasn't until 1637 that the bubble burst, a full three years after its start. Some individuals may be inclined to ridicule those who fell prey to the mania. But in some respects, that crisis was more understandable than the current cryptocurrency bubble is today. After all, at least the purchasers of tulips received something tangible that had some intrinsic value as opposed to a few lines of code. Wikimedia Commons Another example that I would like to point to is the South Sea Bubble. Some of the most brilliant minds of that time fell prey to the crisis, including the much-revered Sir Isaac Newton. Originally founded in 1711, the South Sea Company was structured as a way for the British crown to cover debts that it accrued as part of fighting two separate wars, the more notable of which was the War of the Spanish Succession. Holders of roughly £9 million were forced to surrender their debt to the new company in exchange for shares entitling them to an ownership percentage. A lower interest rate on that debt was then arranged and paid to the company, with those amounts being paid to shareholders in return. To create some value within the enterprise, the South Sea Company was also granted a monopoly on the slave trade with South America that would eventually yield some financial benefit. For the sake of brevity, I won't cover all of the details of that crisis. But in short, rampant speculation led to the implied value of the South Sea Company being higher than all of the assets of Britain before the bubble ultimately burst. As the chart below illustrates, the Dot-Com Bubble (as measured by the NASDAQ) saw a similar pattern. Data by YCharts In many cases, it does take some large event for a speculative bubble to eventually collapse. That large event for Bitcoin might very well end up being the collapse of FTX. Already, there are concerns about the financial stability of other cryptocurrency platforms such as crypto.com and BlockFi . We saw following the housing collapse in the early 2000s just what happens when a space is poorly regulated. And what is evident in this case is that the cryptocurrency market is far worse off from a regulatory perspective than the housing market was back then. You also have other factors at play. Higher interest rates, for instance, will ultimately lead to less appetite when it comes to riskier assets. And perhaps nothing is of higher risk right now than cryptocurrency. While it is true that these particular issues can perhaps be weathered by the industry, when coupled with the fact that there is not any substantial value to Bitcoin, it's more likely than not that this is all part of a perfect storm that will sink Bitcoin for good. Takeaway Truth be told, I don't expect this article to change the minds of any who are bullish about cryptocurrency. I do hope, however, that it might serve as a cautionary note for those who decide to dabble in the market or those who are thinking about doing so. At the end of the day, there is some marginal value in Bitcoin. But that value relates only to the underlying ability of blockchain to instantly facilitate financial transactions across the globe. Fundamentally, I believe the market for Bitcoin and, more generally, cryptocurrency, should have never grown to what it is today. Already, there has been significant pain caused by its downturn. More likely than not, this pain will continue. Of course, it is possible that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will eventually rebound and soar past their prior highs. But I think any such reprieve like that would only prove temporary since it cannot escape the truth of its very nature.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559849-why-i-believe-bitcoin-collapse-is-imminent?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4642303.jpeg

The blockchain’s native token, TON, is currently among the top cryptos leading the market in weekly gains. As of the time of writing, TON’s price was $1.74, a 0.31% decline on the day. However, its weekly rise was 2%. Toncoin’s media attraction came with the launch of Telegram’s unique username auction feature. In addition, this saw the launch of their marketplace, Fragment, where these usernames can be auctioned. Furthermore, the TON blockchain secured a massive investment deal with DWF Labs in the past few days. All these, together, resulted in the token’s rise this past week. Related Reading: These Bitcoin Metrics Signal A Capitulation Event Is Near Toncoin Hopes To Get $10 Million From DWF Labs – Can the Deal Take TON To The Moon? In a recent announcement, DWF Labs, a famous market maker, has inked a new partnership with the Ton blockchain. This partnership will see the blockchain receive $10 million in investment and other technical and market-making support. The collaboration will also see the market maker helping TON get listed on other exchanges. As of writing, TON is only listed in a handful of exchanges, including Kucoin, Huobi Global, and OKX, among others. It’s yet to be listed on top exchanges like Binance. It is unclear whether DWF Labs can help TON reach new highs. But it certainly seems that they have an interest in doing so. With the news, TON’S price rose by 4.2%, reaching $1.74 at press time. However, it has shed some gains, mainly due to the overall bearish trend across all cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency market is still reeling from the recent drop in prices thanks to the FTX implosion. As investors are bearish and weary, there is no telling how much more the crypto market could fall. However, positive news like this might contribute to getting the market back on track. Traders Aren’t Bullish On Toncoin The CoinMarketCap community has voted that Toncoin may decline by January 2023. Approximately 142 users voted that Toncoin would trade at an average of $1.487 at the start of next year. The votes were compiled using the Price Estimates tool on the CoinMarketCap website. This is a 12% drop from the token’s current market price at press time. But looking at the Toncoin’s price chart and recent developments, it seems unlikely that the token will drop that much. Earlier this month, the number of new accounts and wallet holders increased. Specifically, over the past week, there has been a 5% growth in the number of wallets holding TON. Related Reading: XRP Price Holds Ground While BTC and ETH Slide, Here’s Breakout Zone As of November 15, there were 2,829 unique wallet addresses.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply Has Sharply Declined Recently According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the long-term holder supply has observed one of its most significant declines this year in recent days. The “long-term holder” (LTH) group is a Bitcoin cohort that includes all those investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago, without having sold or moved them. Statistically, the longer an investor keeps their coins still, the less likely they become to sell them at any moment. Since LTHs make up the group that keeps their coins dormant the most, they are the cohort that’s least probable to dump amid times of pressure. The “long-term holder supply” is an indicator that measures the total amount of BTC that this group as a whole is holding in their wallets right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Selling At Large Losses, Is Final Capitulation Here? When the value of this metric slips down, it means LTHs have moved their coins, possibly for selling purposes. While an increase suggests these holders have been expanding their treasuries recently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin LTH supply over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been on the decline in recent days | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 47, 2022 As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTH supply set a new all-time high of around 13.883 million BTC just a couple of weeks or so ago. This peak was just before the crash triggered by the fall of crypto exchange FTX initiated. As soon as the price plunge started, however, the indicator’s value also began to go down. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Below $16k As Older Whales Show Signs Of Dumping This means that the LTHs were dumping their coins, contributing to the price decline. The decrease in their supply has been consistently happening in the last two weeks, suggesting that these resolute holders didn’t slow down even after the initial crash was over. So far, the Bitcoin LTH supply has gone down by about 84.56k BTC since the ATH was set, taking the metric’s value to 13.799 million BTC. While this drawdown is significant, it’s still less than the previous three selloffs seen in May, June, and July. Nonetheless, this is still a sign of weakness from what should be the most resolute holder group in the Bitcoin market, and the selloff also still seems to be underway so it can can possibly even deepen.

42421218,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqdZ,1669129560,Who Is Alameda's Former co-CEO Sam Trabucco?,"Former co-CEO of Alameda Research  One of the firm's first hires, who oversaw the development of ever-riskier trading strategies  Retired in early 2022  When Sam Trabucco stepped down as co-CEO of trading firm Alameda Research in August, he tweeted, ""But if I've learned anything at Alameda, it's how to make good decisions – and this is the right one for me.""  In hindsight, it seems like impeccable timing for Trabucco to quit a high-stress job to spend time on his newly purchased boat – mere months before the company would go under water.  See also: Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle  It only took 10 days for Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire to go from processing withdrawals, albeit slowly, to declaring bankruptcy. This followed a CoinDesk report in November showing that, for all intents and purposes, Alameda Research, which had $8 billion of liabilities and $14.6 billion in assets, was insolvent.  The hedge fund Trabucco ran likely came to own many of its illiquid altcoins during his tenure. This includes the inexplicably large amount of FTT, the exchange token for Alameda’s sister company, FTX.  Trabucco joined Alameda as a trader in 2019 after a stint as a quant trader on Susquehanna International Group’s bond desk. He was appointed co-CEO in October 2021 with Caroline Ellison, after his friend-cum-boss Bankman-Fried resigned in an attempt to distance the SBF-owned trading firm from the SBF-controlled trading platform.  “He is not really involved in day-to-day operations in Alameda. Caroline and I have been leading the charge there for quite some time,” Trabucco told CoinDesk at the time.  Trabucco met Bankman-Fried during a five week math camp at Mount Holyoke College in 2010, according to Insider. He recalled that Bankman-Fried barely slept during their stay. The two reunited at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Trabucco received his bachelor’s degrees in math and computer science.  As co-CEO, Trabucco helped oversee Alameda’s expansion beyond its initial market-neutral, but relatively low-profit business as a market maker for low-volume cryptocurrencies into riskier trading strategies, according to a Twitter thread detailing that shift. For instance, he said Alameda traders began exploring yield farming in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Eventually, according to Trabucco’s account, the trading firm began taking in “huge” profits placing highly leveraged bets on assets like dogecoin after noticing its price went up whenever Elon Musk tweeted about the meme coin.  Although the full story is not yet known, emerging evidence suggests Alameda suffered a series of losses during the beginning of the crypto market downturn. Ellison did not include Trabucco among a list of named persons who knew about the decision to send customer funds to Alameda, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.  In August, Trabucco announced his resignation and became an adviser of the company. On Nov. 8, when FTX agreed to sell itself to Binance, Trabucco tweeted, ""Much love to everyone,"" and that he ""hope[d] the road ahead is brighter.""

In fact, there’s little public information about Wang, who has been described as a shady but critical player in the rise and fall of FTX.  Wang met Bankman-Fried at a math camp in high school. Later, they became college roommates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Wang got degrees in mathematics and computer science and Bankman-Fried received a bachelor's in physics.  See also: Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle  Before co-founding Alameda Research (and later FTX), Wang worked at Google. He claims to have built a system to aggregate prices across public flight data, according to an introduction on the Future Fund's website. When Bankman-Fried left the Jane Street Hedge Fund to start Alameda in 2017, Wang left the tech giant.  The startup has its beginnings in a three-bedroom Berkeley apartment – the downstairs served as its office. The firm shifted to Hong Kong, in part to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities in Asian bitcoin markets – including the price discrepancy between BTC in Japan and BTC everywhere else.  It’s there that Wang and Bankman-Fried funneled funds from Alameda to build its bespoke derivatives exchange. Bankman-Fried told Insider that he is not a good coder: ""I don't code. I'm trash. I have not written any of FTX's code base. That's all a lot of other really impressive people at FTX. That's not me at all.""  Nishad Singh, the head of engineering at FTX, said Wang was a ""really good mentor"" who offered suggestions and advice to push things out on short timescales.  In the aftermath of FTX’s collapse, and the subsequent $400 million hack, questions are circulating around who could possibly have abused client funds. Wang is a prominent suspect, as one of the few people with ""root access"" to the exchange’s code base, according to The Block.  Wang is also one of the board members of FTX Future Fund – the charity guided by “effective altruism” that aims to ""use reason and evidence to do the most good possible for the most people.""  Wang, one of the 10 roommates in Bankman-Fried’ luxury penthouse in the Bahamas, is reportedly among the four people cited by Caroline Ellison who knew about the decision to send customer funds to Alameda, according to people who spoke to the Wall Street Journal.  A few Wang photos are circulating on the internet, though little else is known about the mysterious co-founder who preferred to stay in the shadows as SBF chased the limelight. In a now infamous picture on FTX’s website, CTO Wang is seen with his back facing the camera as he focuses on the monitors in front of him.  At the age of 28, Wang topped Forbes' 2022 list of the world's billionaires under 30 with a net worth of $5.9 billion in April.

Budish specifically called for an additional low- to mid-single digit growth to Coinbase's ( COIN ) trading revenue as FTX's multi-billion dollar collapse opens the door for other large centralized exchanges to take (retail) market share. That potential upside would be due to the ""geographic overlap between the two companies, our capture assumptions, and early reads on where funds from FTX were flowing,"" the analyst explained, noting that his analysis was based on an assumed capture of FTX's volumes prior to its suspension of customer withdrawals. Coinbase ( COIN ), meanwhile, has already struggled with a sharp deceleration in trading volume in the past year given a broader crypto bear market and worsening macroeconomic conditions. Trading volume for Q3 was $159B vs. $217B in Q2 and $327B in Q3 of last year.

42421221,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqeb,1669129264,Who Is Alameda Research's Caroline Ellison?,"Former CEO of Alameda Research  Child of MIT economists  Colleague of Sam Bankman-Fried from Jane Street days  The former CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison, has spent her entire professional career as a trader. While a junior studying math at Stanford University, Ellison took her first of two internships with Jane Street, a Wall Street hedge fund known for its heavy use of algorithms, where she excelled. She put off a one-year master’s degree program to join the firm full time.  “Trading is the biggest thing that allowed me to excel in trading,” Ellison said in an interview for Alameda’s podcast in 2021. For anyone else, the statement would be a tautology, but for the bookish Ellison, who came into crypto as a skeptic, it was never obvious that she’d lead one of the most influential digital asset hedge funds.  See also: Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle  After a year and a half on Jane Street’s equities desk, Ellison made a “lateral” move to Alameda, after meeting her former Jane Street colleague Sam Bankman-Fried for coffee in the Bay area. She has said Bankman-Fried was initially cagey about what Alameda did. She came aboard with “more experience than a lot of Alameda traders at the time,” she said.  Alameda, at its founding, was a market maker for low-liquidity altcoins. It took a market-neutral approach to the industry, but eventually began taking a more participatory role in crypto and increasingly bullish or bearish leveraged bets on specific coins. This includes yield farming on decentralized finance protocols, she said. She had never used the Ethereum wallet MetaMask before DeFi Summer.  While the details are yet unknown, it seems like the cracks in Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading empire appeared first at Alameda following the collapse of the LUNA coin bubble. In a May 25 podcast with Spanish-language El Momento, Ellison now infamously said many of her trades relied on “elementary school math” and gut.  In October 2021, Ellison was appointed as co-CEO of Alameda with Sam Trabucco after Bankman-Fried resigned from the firm in an effort to put distance between the exchange and trading shop he founded. She has described her role as “broad.” Ellison became sole CEO in August, following Trabucco’s departure from the firm.  Like many within the FTX-Alameda orbit, Ellison was an “effective altruist,” or someone who tries to maximize the good they can do by making money and spending it based on supposedly rational calculations. Ellison is thought to be the person behind a blog called “World Optimization,” which covered topics popular in the California Rationalist community including polyamory and race science, Futurism reported.  Until this week, Ellison lived with nine other FTX or Alameda colleagues in Bankman-Fried’s $30 million penthouse in the Bahamas. She reportedly paid SBF rent, and was occasionally in a romantic relationship with him. In 2021, Ellison tweeted about recreational stimulant use.  “Young people tend to be too risk averse,” Ellison said in a more recent Alameda podcast episode.  The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Ellison told Alameda staffers in a video call that she was one of four people aware of the decision to send FTX customer funds to Alameda, to help the fund meet its liabilities. In early November, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported that Alameda was structurally insolvent as much of the money it had on hand was illiquid altcoins, particularly FTX’s exchange token, FTT.  Ellison has been a fan of the Harry Potter series since childhood, and has written LARPs (live action role playing games) in her free time. She was reportedly working on writing a novel.  Adding to the intrigue: Ellison’s father, Glenn Ellison, is the Gregory K. Palm Professor of Economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is the head of the economics department and was in this role when current Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler famously taught an MIT course on blockchain. Her mother, Sara Fischer Ellison, is also an economics department lecturer at the university.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/22/who-is-alameda-researchs-caroline-ellison,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e250fdeda4019cec15b6963ba076935506186e49-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421230,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqpx,1669129087,"Who Is William MacAskill, the Oxford Philosopher Who Shaped Sam Bankman-Fried’s Worldview?","A chief architect of the effective altruism philosophical movement  Mentor of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried  Philosophy professor at Oxford  As the world picks through the wreckage of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research, scrutiny has fallen largely on founder Sam Bankman-Fried and his close circle of allies. But one hugely important figure in the immense financial catastrophe was never a part of Bankman-Fried’s corporate leadership circle: the 35-year-old Scottish philosopher William MacAskill.  Instead, MacAskill is the thinker perhaps most associated with the moral philosophy known as “effective altruism,” which was profoundly influential on Bankman-Fried, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and others in their intimate circle. MacAskill is currently an associate professor in philosophy and a research fellow at the Global Priorities Institute at England’s University of Oxford. He is the author of several books, including a 2016 introduction to effective altruism called “Doing Good Better” and a recent follow up called “What We Owe the Future.”  See also: Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle  Those books, and MacAskill’s broader body of work, may be due for a reassessment after the FTX debacle. Some have argued that MacAskill’s ethical views helped nudge Bankman-Fried to take the risks that ultimately led to the implosion of the Alameda/FTX empire. And according to people, including one of Bankman-Fried’s most prominent financial backers, MacAskill wasn’t just a philosophical influencer: He played a direct role in guiding Bankman-Fried along the path that led to the creation, and ultimately implosion, of Alameda Research and the FTX exchange.  After Bankman-Fried established the philanthropic Future Fund, MacAskill became an adviser, helping distribute funds for maximum impact. After the collapse of Alameda and FTX, MacAskill announced that he had resigned, saying the role had been unpaid. Staff of the Future Fund have also resigned, announcing that many grants already promised to organizations will now go unfulfilled because of the blowup.  Read more: How Sam Bankman-Fried’s ‘Effective’ Altruism Blew Up FTX  While many moral systems maintain that human suffering could be best alleviated by spreading both wealth and power more democratically, effective altruism essentially argues the opposite: that the very smartest and hardest-working individuals should pursue wealth and influence, then leverage it to the greater good. Many if not most members of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle professed effective altruist beliefs. According to a recent profile of MacAskill in the New Yorker, effective altruists worldwide now control roughly $30 billion in philanthropic funds.  According to a fawning profile of Bankman-Fried published by Sequoia Capital, MacAskill had a direct and sizable influence on the founder’s worldview from very early on. (Sequoia has long been one of the most respected venture capital funds in Silicon Valley, and invested a reported $210 million in FTX. It has since written the investment down to zero – and deleted the profile of Bankman-Fried from its website.)  MacAskill, according to the Sequoia profile, was introduced to SBF through MIT’s Epsilon Theta, the “coed fraternity of supergeeks” through which many future members of the FTX leadership circle first connected. That led to a coffee meeting in which MacAskill pitched effective altruism to Bankman-Fried, years before SBF founded the crypto exchange.  During that initial meeting, MacAskill reportedly urged Bankman-Fried to adopt an “earn to give” approach to life. That mindset could be easily mistaken for a moral license to bend the rules, especially by someone who, like Sam Bankman-Fried, “would never read a book.”  But MacAskill’s influence was not merely to give Bankman-Fried an all-too-wobbly ethical framework. Also according to the Sequoia profile, it was MacAskill who suggested Bankman-Fried pursue an internship at the trading firm Jane Street, rather than more directly public-spirited options Bankman-Fried was considering, such as becoming a journalist or entering politics directly. Jane Street became a stepping stone that led directly to the creation, and ultimately downfall, of Alameda Research and FTX.  The global effective altruism community even reportedly played a direct role in the “kimchi premium” trade that is believed to have generated the capital for the creation of FTX. Again according to the Sequoia profile, a Japanese effective altruist helped Bankman-Fried set up the Japanese banking needed to arbitrage the premium on the price of bitcoin in South Korea.  Bankman-Fried’s behavior, which increasingly appears to have included not just mismanagement but substantial fraud, has triggered a wave of vexed soul-searching in the effective altruism community. But critics of MacAskill’s ideas have for years insisted they founder on basic questions, such as: Who determines the right people to (altruistically) pursue wealth and influence? The answer would seem to be a hyper-capitalist tautology: The people who make the most money are inherently the most deserving, because they’re the smartest and therefore also know the best ways to improve the world.  An implicit version of this type of “altruism” was arguably baked into the “change the world” narratives that for a time fueled excitement around tech companies like Facebook (now Meta). That isn't a surprise: This philosophical frame is an ideal way to make boatloads of money doing things like selling user data without having to feel bad about it, as long as you give a lot of the money away. In practice, that’s not so different from the charitable efforts of old-school robber barons like John D. Rockefeller.  To his credit, MacAskill wrote in the aftermath of the collapse that “if those involved deceived others and engaged in fraud … they entirely abandoned the principles of the effective altruism community.” He also seems to have taken his principles more seriously than many of his adherents. According to the New Yorker profile, in his youth MacAskill cut his own expenses to the bone so he could donate money to help people in need, to the point of relying on homemade bread for his dinners.  But that more onerous side of the effective altruism seems fairly flexible for some, including Bankman-Fried: a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas shared with 10 friends is, after all, still a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH,David Z.

42411074,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBWAu,1669128819,Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle,"The downfall of FTX was swift and brutal. In a matter of eight days earlier this month, the crypto exchange – developed as a skunk-work project inside Sam Bankman-Fried’s quant-driven trading shop, Alameda Research – went from being one of the most used and valuable crypto companies ever to a pile of failed bets and worthless tokens.  How exactly the firm collapsed is still a matter of investigation. Three U.S. federal agencies – the Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity and Futures Trading Commission – are probing the remains while insiders begin to speak out about a company that rose and fell like a house of cards.  FTX’s new chief executive, John Ray III, has said Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading empire is the biggest “failure of corporate controls” he’s seen – a notable statement considering Ray helped unravel the Enron scandal and to get its investors paid. Upwards of one million FTX customers have lost funds, according to bankruptcy filings.  While not conclusively proven, it seems that FTX client money was being gambled by Alameda traders. That could have been standard operating procedure for years between the two closely linked firms, or part of a poorly planned scheme to patch holes in the hedge fund’s balance sheet that emerged in the market downturn earlier this year.  And that’s just it: As the story continues to develop, the world is none the wiser about the motivations behind crypto’s most significant collapse since Mt. Gox. Is Sam Bankman-Fried, the disheveled, media-hungry founder, a sociopath, as some are beginning to say? Or a product of a worldview called effective altruism, which might encourage people to lie, cheat or steal their way to a fortune – so long as it’s for a good cause?  There were red flags along the way. Brian Armstrong, surveying the wreckage, has said he was always curious about Bankman-Fried’s burn rate, considering the relative size of FTX and Armstrong’s own crypto exchange, Coinbase. Then there’s the warning signs in FTX’s accounting – including signs of tax avoidance and misappropriation (to say nothing of Prager Metis, FTX’s sketchy auditing firm with an office in Decentraland).  See also: What Investors and Accountants Missed in FTX's Audits  What about the fact that FTX’s C-Suite was composed of mostly inexperienced friends of Bankman-Fried? CoinDesk, which kick-started the FTX fall with a terse story about Alameda’s illiquid assets, has since reported that FTX was primarily controlled by an inner-circle of close associates. Not much is known about the group – made worse as members take steps to delete their social media accounts.  By and large, SBF’s inner circle were all adherents of effective altruism. They lived closely together, in Bahamian property owned by FTX and Bankman-Fried, and formed romantic relationships. Some may have been clued in about a so-called backdoor between FTX and Alameda, which allowed client funds to be transferred without leaving a trace.  CoinDesk has gathered what information is available about these individuals, which includes childhood friends of Bankman-Fried and recent hires. Not everyone listed will be implicated in what looks like fraud, but as high-level operators they should do what they can to make sure the full story is told.  Who is Caroline Ellison?  Former CEO of Alameda Research  Child of MIT economists  Colleague of Sam Bankman-Fried from Jane Street days  The former CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison, has spent her entire professional career as a trader.

After a year and a half on Jane Street’s equities desk, Ellison made a “lateral” move to Alameda, after meeting her former Jane Street colleague Sam Bankman-Fried for coffee in the Bay area. She has said Bankman-Fried was initially cagey about what Alameda did. She came aboard with “more experience than a lot of Alameda traders at the time,” she said.  See also: Who Is Alameda Research's Caroline Ellison?  Alameda, at its founding, was a market maker for low-liquidity altcoins. It took a market-neutral approach to the industry, but eventually began taking a more participatory role in crypto and increasingly bullish or bearish leveraged bets on specific coins. This includes yield farming on decentralized finance protocols, she said. She had never used the Ethereum wallet MetaMask before DeFi Summer.  While the details are yet unknown, it seems like the cracks in Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading empire appeared first at Alameda following the collapse of the LUNA coin bubble. In a May 25 podcast with Spanish-language El Momento, Ellison now infamously said many of her trades relied on “elementary school math” and gut.  In October 2021, Ellison was appointed as co-CEO of Alameda with Sam Trabucco after Bankman-Fried resigned from the firm in an effort to put distance between the exchange and trading shop he founded. She has described her role as “broad.” Ellison became sole CEO in August, following Trabucco’s departure from the firm.  Like many within the FTX-Alameda orbit, Ellison was an “effective altruist,” or someone who tries to maximize the good they can do by making money and spending it based on supposedly rational calculations. Ellison is thought to be the person behind a blog called “World Optimization,” which covered topics popular in the California Rationalist community including polyamory and race science, Futurism reported.  Until this week, Ellison lived with nine other FTX or Alameda colleagues in Bankman-Fried’s $30 million penthouse in the Bahamas. She reportedly paid SBF rent, and was occasionally in a romantic relationship with him. In 2021, Ellison tweeted about recreational stimulant use.  “Young people tend to be too risk averse,” Ellison said in a more recent Alameda podcast episode.  The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Ellison told Alameda staffers in a video call that she was one of four people aware of the decision to send FTX customer funds to Alameda, to help the fund meet its liabilities. In early November, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported that Alameda was structurally insolvent as much of the money it had on hand was illiquid altcoins, particularly FTX’s exchange token, FTT.  See also: More Than 50% of Bitcoin Addresses Are Now in Loss  Ellison has been a fan of the Harry Potter series since childhood, and has written LARPs (live action role playing games) in her free time. She was reportedly working on writing a novel.  Adding to the intrigue: Ellison’s father, Glenn Ellison, is the Gregory K. Palm Professor of Economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is the head of the economics department and was in this role when current Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler famously taught an MIT course on blockchain. Her mother, Sara Fischer Ellison, is also an economics department lecturer at the university.  Who is Nishad Singh?  An early hire at Alameda  Appointed to director of engineering, who worked under Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang  Best friend to SBF’s brother in high school  Nishad Singh joined Alameda Research in the early days, when the five-person trading firm was based in a Berkeley, California, apartment. He went from finding and exploiting arbitrage opportunities in crypto markets to being appointed director of engineering at FTX.  Singh is thought to be a close confidant of Bankman-Fried, having shared multiple apartments with the FTX founder over the years, including most recently a 10-person luxury penthouse in Nassau, the Bahamas.  He is rumored to be just one of three people who controlled the keys to the exchange’s matching engine, and may have been informed of a plan to backstop losses at Alameda with FTX customer funds.  Singh did not return a request for comment for this article. Although his LinkedIn profile is down and his Twitter account locked, the University of California, Berkeley graduate talked about why he left his dream job at Facebook to join Alameda Research in a FTX podcast.  ""I spent maybe about a month doing weekends and nights at Alameda,” he said, discussing a period of time when his “day job” was as a software engineer working on applied machine learning at Facebook. “At some point, it became obvious that was kind of stupid … so I took some time off and really gave my 100% working at Alameda,"" Singh said.  Singh visited Alameda in the first month of its existence, where he witnessed Bankman-Fried execute a sequence of trades that he described as ""super profitable, easy to understand and there were lots available."" Feeling inspired, he took a job.  In the podcast, Singh said he was also attracted to the company's cultural commitment to effective altruism, a movement that ""aims to find the best ways to help others,"" which he discovered in college. He is a board member of FTX Future Fund, a part of the FTX Foundation, a philanthropic collective funded principally by Bankman-Fried and other senior FTX executives.  ""It was pretty clear that everybody working [at Alameda] was highly motivated, was sort of effective altruism-aligned, which mattered a lot to me and was really [a] bright spot. I could learn a lot from them,"" Singh said in the podcast.  After spending one and a half years as a core Alameda engineer, Singh took a role as the head of engineering at the then-newly launched FTX derivative exchange in 2019, where he was allowed to code with “minimal supervision.” He has provided code to a number of Bankman-Fried-related projects, including the decentralized exchange Serum on Solana.  “Nishad was one of my brother’s best friends in high school. He’s shown the fastest and most sustained professional growth I’ve ever witnessed,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a company blog. Singh also reportedly built most of FTX’s “technological infrastructure” and managed the development team.  Although pitched as a community-run and- organized exchange, people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk the true power over Serum rested with FTX Group, which then held the program’s access keys. A similar relationship may be in place at FTX’s core properties.  Singh is reportedly now ""under supervision"" by Bahamian authorities along with Bankman-Fried and Wang.  Who is Sam Trabucco?  Former co-CEO of Alameda Research  One of the firm's first hires, who oversaw the development of ever-riskier trading strategies  Retired in early 2022  When Sam Trabucco stepped down as co-CEO of trading firm Alameda Research in August, he tweeted, ""But if I've learned anything at Alameda, it's how to make good decisions – and this is the right one for me.""  In hindsight, it seems like impeccable timing for Trabucco to quit a high-stress job to spend time on his newly purchased boat – mere months before the company would go under water.  It only took 10 days for Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire to go from processing withdrawals, albeit slowly, to declaring bankruptcy. This followed a CoinDesk report in November showing that, for all intents and purposes, Alameda Research, which had $8 billion of liabilities and $14.6 billion in assets, was insolvent.  See also: Who Is Alameda's Former co-CEO Sam Trabucco?  The hedge fund Trabucco ran likely came to own many of its illiquid altcoins during his tenure. This includes the inexplicably large amount of FTT, the exchange token for Alameda’s sister company, FTX.  Trabucco joined Alameda as a trader in 2019 after a stint as a quant trader on Susquehanna International Group’s bond desk. He was appointed co-CEO in October 2021 with Caroline Ellison, after his friend-cum-boss Bankman-Fried resigned in an attempt to distance the SBF-owned trading firm from the SBF-controlled trading platform.  “He is not really involved in day-to-day operations in Alameda. Caroline and I have been leading the charge there for quite some time,” Trabucco told CoinDesk at the time.  Trabucco met Bankman-Fried during a five week math camp at Mount Holyoke College in 2010, according to Insider. He recalled that Bankman-Fried barely slept during their stay. The two reunited at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Trabucco received his bachelor’s degrees in math and computer science.  As co-CEO, Trabucco helped oversee Alameda’s expansion beyond its initial market-neutral, but relatively low-profit business as a market maker for low-volume cryptocurrencies into riskier trading strategies, according to a Twitter thread detailing that shift. For instance, he said Alameda traders began exploring yield farming in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Eventually, according to Trabucco’s account, the trading firm began taking in “huge” profits placing highly leveraged bets on assets like dogecoin after noticing its price went up whenever Elon Musk tweeted about the meme coin.  Although the full story is not yet known, emerging evidence suggests Alameda suffered a series of losses during the beginning of the crypto market downturn. Ellison did not include Trabucco among a list of named persons who knew about the decision to send customer funds to Alameda, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.  In August, Trabucco announced his resignation and became an adviser of the company. On Nov. 8, when FTX agreed to sell itself to Binance, Trabucco tweeted, ""Much love to everyone,"" and that he ""hope[d] the road ahead is brighter.""  Trabucco did not return a request for comment for this article.  Who is Gary Wang?  The co-founder of Alameda Research and FTX  A mysterious ex-Googler who also served as chief technology officer for both firms  Reportedly Bankman-Fried’s childhood friend  Gary Wang is not like his co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who loves fame and putting himself at the center of public attention (even when people are begging him to stop tweeting). In fact, there’s little public information about Wang, who has been described as a shady but critical player in the rise and fall of FTX.  Wang met Bankman-Fried at a math camp in high school. Later, they became college roommates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Wang got degrees in mathematics and computer science and Bankman-Fried received a bachelor's in physics.  Before co-founding Alameda Research (and later FTX), Wang worked at Google. He claims to have built a system to aggregate prices across public flight data, according to an introduction on the Future Fund's website. When Bankman-Fried left the Jane Street Hedge Fund to start Alameda in 2017, Wang left the tech giant.  See also: Who Is Gary Wang, the Mysterious Co-Founder of FTX and Alameda?  The startup has its beginnings in a three-bedroom Berkeley apartment – the downstairs served as its office. The firm shifted to Hong Kong, in part to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities in Asian bitcoin markets – including the price discrepancy between BTC in Japan and BTC everywhere else.  It’s there that Wang and Bankman-Fried funneled funds from Alameda to build its bespoke derivatives exchange. Bankman-Fried told Insider that he is not a good coder: ""I don't code. I'm trash. I have not written any of FTX's code base. That's all a lot of other really impressive people at FTX. That's not me at all.""  Nishad Singh, the head of engineering at FTX, said Wang was a ""really good mentor"" who offered suggestions and advice to push things out on short timescales.  In the aftermath of FTX’s collapse, and the subsequent $400 million hack, questions are circulating around who could possibly have abused client funds. Wang is a prominent suspect, as one of the few people with ""root access"" to the exchange’s code base, according to The Block.  Wang is also one of the board members of FTX Future Fund – the charity guided by “effective altruism” that aims to ""use reason and evidence to do the most good possible for the most people.""  Wang, one of the 10 roommates in Bankman-Fried’ luxury penthouse in the Bahamas, is reportedly among the four people cited by Caroline Ellison who knew about the decision to send customer funds to Alameda, according to people who spoke to the Wall Street Journal.  A few Wang photos are circulating on the internet, though little else is known about the mysterious co-founder who preferred to stay in the shadows as SBF chased the limelight. In a now infamous picture on FTX’s website, CTO Wang is seen with his back facing the camera as he focuses on the monitors in front of him.  At the age of 28, Wang topped Forbes' 2022 list of the world's billionaires under 30 with a net worth of $5.9 billion in April. SBF sent his congratulations to Wang in public, tweeting that ""I couldn't be prouder"" when the list came out.  Who is William MacAskill?  A chief architect of effective altruism  Mentor of Sam Bankman-Fried  Philosophy professor at Oxford  As the world picks through the wreckage of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research, scrutiny has fallen largely on founder Sam Bankman-Fried and his close circle of allies. But one hugely important figure in the immense financial catastrophe was never a part of Bankman-Fried’s corporate leadership circle: the 35-year-old Scottish philosopher William MacAskill.  Instead, MacAskill is the thinker perhaps most associated with the moral philosophy known as “effective altruism,” which was profoundly influential on Bankman-Fried, Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and others in their intimate circle. MacAskill is currently an associate professor in philosophy and a research fellow at the Global Priorities Institute at England’s University of Oxford. He is the author of several books, including a 2016 introduction to effective altruism called “Doing Good Better” and a recent follow up called “What We Owe the Future.”  Those books, and MacAskill’s broader body of work, may be due for a reassessment after the FTX debacle. Some have argued that MacAskill’s ethical views helped nudge Bankman-Fried to take the risks that ultimately led to the implosion of the Alameda/FTX empire. And according to people, including one of Bankman-Fried’s most prominent financial backers, MacAskill wasn’t just a philosophical influencer: He played a direct role in guiding Bankman-Fried along the path that led to the creation, and ultimately implosion, of Alameda Research and the FTX exchange.  See also: Who Is William MacAskill, the Oxford Philosopher Who Shaped Sam Bankman-Fried’s Worldview?  After Bankman-Fried established the philanthropic Future Fund, MacAskill became an adviser, helping distribute funds for maximum impact. After the collapse of Alameda and FTX, MacAskill announced that he had resigned, saying the role had been unpaid. Staff of the Future Fund have also resigned, announcing that many grants already promised to organizations will now go unfulfilled because of the blowup.  While many moral systems maintain that human suffering could be best alleviated by spreading both wealth and power more democratically, effective altruism essentially argues the opposite: that the very smartest and hardest-working individuals should pursue wealth and influence, then leverage it to the greater good. Many if not most members of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle professed effective altruist beliefs. According to a recent profile of MacAskill in the New Yorker, effective altruists worldwide now control roughly $30 billion in philanthropic funds.  According to a fawning profile of Bankman-Fried published by Sequoia Capital, MacAskill had a direct and sizable influence on the founder’s worldview from very early on. (Sequoia has long been one of the most respected venture capital funds in Silicon Valley, and invested a reported $210 million in FTX. It has since written the investment down to zero – and deleted the profile of Bankman-Fried from its website.)  MacAskill, according to the Sequoia profile, was introduced to SBF through MIT’s Epsilon Theta, the “coed fraternity of supergeeks” through which many future members of the FTX leadership circle first connected. That led to a coffee meeting in which MacAskill pitched effective altruism to Bankman-Fried, years before SBF founded the crypto exchange.  During that initial meeting, MacAskill reportedly urged Bankman-Fried to adopt an “earn to give” approach to life. That mindset could be easily mistaken for a moral license to bend the rules, especially by someone who, like Sam Bankman-Fried, “would never read a book.”  But MacAskill’s influence was not merely to give Bankman-Fried an all-too-wobbly ethical framework. Also according to the Sequoia profile, it was MacAskill who suggested Bankman-Fried pursue an internship at the trading firm Jane Street, rather than more directly public-spirited options Bankman-Fried was considering, such as becoming a journalist or entering politics directly. Jane Street became a stepping stone that led directly to the creation, and ultimately downfall, of Alameda Research and FTX.  The global effective altruism community even reportedly played a direct role in the “kimchi premium” trade that is believed to have generated the capital for the creation of FTX. Again according to the Sequoia profile, a Japanese effective altruist helped Bankman-Fried set up the Japanese banking needed to arbitrage the premium on the price of bitcoin in South Korea.  See also: Why Bitcoin Needs Philosophy | Opinion  Bankman-Fried’s behavior, which increasingly appears to have included not just mismanagement but substantial fraud, has triggered a wave of vexed soul-searching in the effective altruism community. But critics of MacAskill’s ideas have for years insisted they founder on basic questions, such as: Who determines the right people to (altruistically) pursue wealth and influence? The answer would seem to be a hyper-capitalist tautology: The people who make the most money are inherently the most deserving, because they’re the smartest and therefore also know the best ways to improve the world.  An implicit version of this type of “altruism” was arguably baked into the “change the world” narratives that for a time fueled excitement around tech companies like Facebook (now Meta). That isn't a surprise: This philosophical frame is an ideal way to make boatloads of money doing things like selling user data without having to feel bad about it, as long as you give a lot of the money away. In practice, that’s not so different from the charitable efforts of old-school robber barons like John D. Rockefeller.  To his credit, MacAskill wrote in the aftermath of the collapse that “if those involved deceived others and engaged in fraud … they entirely abandoned the principles of the effective altruism community.” He also seems to have taken his principles more seriously than many of his adherents. According to the New Yorker profile, in his youth MacAskill cut his own expenses to the bone so he could donate money to help people in need, to the point of relying on homemade bread for his dinners.  But that more onerous side of the effective altruism seems fairly flexible for some, including Bankman-Fried: a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas shared with 10 friends is, after all, still a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas.  Who is Ramnik Arora?  FTX’s product lead  Sometimes called SBF’s “key lieutenant”  A former Facebook engineer  Ramnik Arora was one of FTX’s most high-profile hires in a period of rapid expansion before the crypto exchange’s quick unraveling in November. The head of product, sometimes called Sam Bankman-Fried’s “key lieutenant,” was “plucked out of obscurity from Meta Platforms in 2020, according to tech news site The Information.  In addition to overseeing the rollout of new products at the exchange, Arora was key to FTX’s investor relations. He reportedly served as a conduit to the venture capital giant Sequoia Capital, which invested in FTX’s Series B funding round and advocated for Bankman-Fried. The firm was valued at $32 billion, before it unraveled.  The Information, citing internal sources, also said Arora played a large role on the opposite side of investor relations at FTX, and helped close a number of venture deals Bankman-Fried and his exchange made into crypto startups. He was a general partner at FTX Ventures, where he helped close rounds with Aptos, LayerZero and Coral.  In a now-notable scene from Bankman-Fried’s fundraising salad days, Arora said he had caught the CEO playing a video game while giving a “well-received presentation.”  “The entire partner meeting, he was playing League of Legends at the same time,” Arora told The New York Times in April.  Arora has a master’s degree in mathematics and computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology, New York University and Stanford. Before joining Facebook (since renamed Meta), he held various roles at IV Capital and Goldman Sachs.  He founded his own venture fund called Toy Ventures, initially seeded with his own and his friends' capital, he said in an interview with Encode Club, a Web3 education channel. He said this business was built up gradually in an “ad hoc” fashion.  In that same interview, Arora said he thought of FTX as an exchange built for “crypto natives” and that part of his mandate was making it a friendly on-ramp for retail investors. This included “obfuscating” the things that make crypto hard, by improving its UX (user experience) and interface.  “Any friction in the process will have a huge drop-off,” he said, adding that he often listened to Crypto Twitter to get a sense of the products in which people would be interested, such as future non-fungible token (NFT) integrations. Compared with his time at Facebook, Arora said the speed of FTX’s product development was its “superpower,” he said.  “We can move on a dime,” Arora said, adding later that its “blockers” were “regulatory,” like figuring out the frameworks and licenses he would need to apply for to launch new services.  Arora is known for his intense work ethic, which may explain his close relationship with Bankman-Fried, who was known to have slept only five hours a day – often on a bean bag chair near his office desk. In the Encore interview, Arora talks about working 20-hour days and said he has decided with his wife that work should take precedence in their lives for the time being.  “It is not a balanced work-life balance,” he said.  Who is Dan Friedberg?  FTX’s chief compliance officer  A lawyer implicated in an online poker-cheating scandal  Daniel S. Friedberg was the chief compliance officer at FTX, the person who oversaw the then-second-largest cryptocurrency exchange’s compliance initiatives before it imploded. He joined the firm in March 2020.  Friedberg has also been tied to an online poker scandal in 2008, where Ultimate Bet’s founder Russ Hamilton was accused of installing a “God mode” on his gambling platform that only certain players had access to – resulting in an estimated $50 million in misappropriated funds.  In a surreptitiously recorded file, Friedberg reportedly advised Hamilton to claim he was a victim of the Ultimate Bets ""God mode"" scam, and push blame on an unnamed consultant to the company who exploited the site’s servers. The audio recordings were published in 2013 under uncertain circumstances and have not been independently verified by CoinDesk.  “I did take this money and I’m not trying to make it right, Dan, so we gotta get that out of the way right away, real quick,” Hamilton allegedly said in the audio recording. Hamilton also founded the World Champion online poker platform.  Veteran short seller Marc Cohodes, one of the few to publicly question the rapid rise of FTX before its fall in a September interview with trading-focused webcast Hedgeye, had noted the potential conflicts of hiring someone connected to a cheating scandal to oversee compliance at the $32 billion FTX exchange.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Switches Legal Counsel  In August, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sent a letter to Friedberg and then-FTX US CEO Brett Harrison to “cease and desist” using marketing language that could have been erroneously interpreted as saying that exchange users accounts were ensured by the federal banking regulator.  Before joining FTX, Friedberg was a partner at Fenwick & West LLP, where he led the law firm’s cryptocurrency division, according to a now-deprecated LinkedIn page. He received a JD and MBA degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Who is Ryan Salame?  Co-CEO of FTX’s Bahamian subsidiary, FTX Digital Markets  A key player in FTX’s global licensing strategy  A restauranteur for Lenox hospitality  At press time, Ryan Salame is one of the few upper-level FTX executives who has not made attempts to delete his internet history. His Twitter and Linkedin accounts are still accessible, for instance, though they have yet to be updated to reflect he has left the firm.  Salame, a 2015 graduate from the University of Massachusetts–Amherst, was co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamas-based holding company for much of the crypto exchange’s global footprint. He also held a CPA license in Massachusetts that expired in 2018. He earned a master’s degree in finance from Georgetown University.  According to people speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Salame allegedly vomited after learning of the depths of deception at FTX, including how the firm’s inner circle misused and lost client funds. He told the WSJ he is not part of that inner circle.  Salame joined FTX in 2019 from the stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial, and before that served as a senior tax accountant at Ernst & Young (EY). On his LinkedIn page he claims to have assisted Bankman-Fried incorporate the recently built exchange as FTX Trading Ltd.  Before being appointed co-CEO of FDM, Salame had spent two years as Alameda Research’s head of OTC [over-the-counter] for the Asia-Pacific region, while based in Hong Kong.  Salame also apparently has ownership in a number of restaurants through a partnership with Lenox Eats. Among those is “a food truck with a flexible ‘pop up’ style menu” called Lunch Pail, which was expected to open in 2022.  Just as Bankman-Fried has become known for his political donations, Salame was also a mega-donor. He had donated $20,367,000 to Republican candidates in 2022, according to OpenSecrets. That makes him the 15th largest donor overall for this past U.S. election cycle.  Who is Constance Wang?  The chief operating officer of FTX  A former compliance staffer at Credit Suisse  Appointed co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets  In the days since FTX exploded, Constance Wang has come under fire for her seeming lack of experience. Indeed, the National University of Singapore graduate – class of 2015 – has a fairly short resume: a Singapore-based Credit Suisse analyst turned business development lead at Huobi who caught the express train to wealth by joining FTX in 2019.  “Constance Wang, the COO of FTX, is an ex-Credit Suisse analyst with [two] years of experience in risk management. It was her first job out of university,” venture capitalist Ana Mostarac tweeted.  As chief operating officer, Wang said she was “primarily responsible for global user growth, partnerships, [public relations and] marketing, institutional clients servicing, and global expansion operations,” as written on her LinkedIn.  In January, 2022, Wang was appointed co-chief executive officer of FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamian licensing structure that held much of FTX’s businesses.  According to CoinDesk, Wang had lived in Sam Bankman-Fried’s 10-person crash pad in the Bahamas. She has since resigned from the company.  Who is Jen Chan?  The FTX chief financial officer  A hire from Bankman-Fried’s Hong Kong days  The full owner of an FTX subsidiary  Jen Chan was the chief financial officer of FTX – and perhaps the only direct report to Sam Bankman-Fried who had any direct work experience in the area of the business she oversaw.  Between 2003 and 2006, Chan was an assistant manager at KPMG, the auditing firm. She then had a multi-year stint at Blackstone, serving at a director level for its investing and accounting business.  Immediately before joining FTX, Chan was head of investment management company Alter Domus’ Hong Kong office, and had also spent time as an accountant in a division of Deutsche Bank called RREEF.  A native of Hong Kong, she attended the city-state’s prestigious Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. She joined Bankman-Fried’s empire in October 2018 as director of Cottonwood Grove Limited, a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of Alameda Research, which was then registered in the British Virgin Islands.  According to the Financial Times, Chan owned 100% of Salameda Ltd, a Hong Kong-based entity of FTX that looked like “a group outrider with links to Alameda entities by service agreements.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Daniel Kuhn, Xinyi Luo, David Z.

Zhao held several meetings with potential backers of the fund last week, including entities affiliated with the United Arab Emirates' national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter.  After the article came out, however, Zhao tweeted that the report was false.  Binance announced its plans to start a recovery fund earlier this month, to help projects with strong fundamentals but suffering a liquidity crisis, owing to the fallout from FTX's collapse.  Details of the fund – its size, the projects it will support etc – are yet to be disclosed.  “CZ’s meetings in Abu Dhabi were all focused on general global regulatory matters – specifically how Middle Eastern regulators could lead the globe by exploring more aggressive proof of custody requirements for crypto exchanges,” a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk.

Report Answers,"In the wake of the FTX collapse, formerly the second-largest exchange in the world, its competitors are taking over its trading volume and market share. The nascent sector is still suffering the consequences of recent events; many crypto companies filed for bankruptcy or are in the process of raising emergency liquidity.

The FTX Demise Creates New Winners In The Crypto Industry? According to a report from analytics firm Messari, crypto trading venues saw a significant decline in aggregate interest following FTX’s bankruptcy. The trading venue represented about 25% of the crypto market’s global Open Interest. As seen in the chart below, the dynamics in the crypto market changed amid the FTX crisis. This platform’s Open Interest has migrated to its competitors. Binance was the most significant benefactor; the platform absorbed most of FTX’s former Open Interest. Nevertheless, the above chart hints at a tale of despair and panic rather than a race with one single clear winner. The Open Interest for crypto exchange platforms plummeted by over 43% in the past week. Messari noted: Binance was the main beneficiary of the FTX Official collapse, gaining 9.6% in market share. DeFi failed to capture any meaningful volume in the fallout continuing to hover around 3%. A limiting factor for DeFi’s ceiling remains expensive transactions and slow block times. In addition to capturing a critical portion of FTX’s Open Interest, market participants migrated to Binance to trade digital assets. The platform saw a spike in its market share for Perpetual Trading Volume. This metric increased from 57% to 67%. Binance Dominates Crypto Exchange Sector In the nascent industry, users believe Binance and its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao capitalized on FTX’s vulnerability to take over the sector. CZ denied this claim by stating that the industry suffered from its competitor’s collapse. However, Messari’s data presents a different picture and hint at the formation of a new landscape in the industry. Additional data from Token Terminal indicates that Binance Coin (BNB) saw an uptick in its trading volume in November.

42394090,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXW9x,1669127090,Crypto Didn’t Fail FTX; People Did,"The spectacular $32 billion collapse of the FTX exchange and its sister trading firm Alameda Research recently once again has crypto’s detractors gloating in the headlines. In fact, FTX bears no resemblance to most of what the longtime believers in blockchains and Web3 are trying to build.  The failure of FTX was not one of insufficient regulation nor of a corrupted codebase, but a human failure. Rather than condemning crypto, FTX demonstrates that truly decentralized, transparent and open Web3 technologies can better protect users and support a more fair and more resilient digital financial system. Here’s why.  Illia Polosukhin is a co-founder of Near Protocol and Unchain Fund.  There was nothing decentralized or transparent about Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire. In reality, FTX bears a lot more resemblance to the overleveraged institutions that failed in 2008 than it does to what most of the blockchain industry is building. The reason is simple: It is centralized and therefore restrictive in participation, owned by few, governed by even fewer. The platform controls the order books and users’ funds, holding reserves within its own vaults.  Bitcoin, the first blockchain, allows peer-to-peer value transfer between two parties anywhere in the world, without the need for an intermediary like a corporation or a bank. Ethereum introduced programmable smart contracts to this paradigm, allowing entire applications to run on this global, distributed network.  Now there are many such programmable blockchains that form the backbone of Web3, the movement to decentralize internet infrastructure using blockchain-based technologies. These open blockchain networks run on transparent, open ledgers where transaction records are verifiable by anyone in the network and therefore very difficult to censor. The benefit of decentralized systems is that they are transparent, so stakeholders know what is happening; censorship resistant, so it’s difficult for bad actors to exploit or take over; and antifragile, so they can adapt in response to challenges.  Centralized exchanges are most useful as an on- and off-ramp between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, with retail users going through extensive know-your-customer processes. These centralized entities, whose reserves and balance sheets are not required to be shared with users or the public, require prudent regulation just as legacy banks and lenders do. And FTX was regulated across the jurisdictions it operated in, just as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were. Bad loans, illiquid collateral and overleveraging have clearly happened in institutions dealing with regulated securities also (FTX held traditional as well as digital assets).  But if investors and users of FTX had access to the same information that users of decentralized exchanges and protocols such as Uniswap and Aave do, this collapse would have been nearly impossible. Account holders on decentralized exchanges have full control of their own funds and can participate in the governance of the platform.  Read more: Nic Carter - Let’s Actually Commit to Proofs of Reserve This Time, Okay?  We’ve seen some other centralized exchanges responding to pressure recently to disclose their reserves, notably Binance and Crypto.com. While reserves don’t reveal corresponding liabilities, this is a positive development in the space toward self-regulation and applying decentralized financial practices to centralized institutions.  FTX’s collapse highlights the need for more decentralized approaches. It’s notable, for example, that both FTX and Celsius Network, another centralized institution that collapsed in July of this year, repaid their decentralized finance (DeFi) loans first because they were publicly visible before eventually declaring bankruptcy. This is clear evidence of the need for data-rich, transparent accounting and compliance systems that protect participants while also preserving an individual’s privacy.  Best practices that apply to DeFi and centralized crypto projects alike, in addition to self-disclosures of reserves and liabilities, might include on-chain asset registries or mandatory transaction posting. For exchanges, a hybrid approach might avoid an exchange custodying users’ funds while still offering recovery via centralized institutions (or support for social recovery).  Regulation can only go so far in closed systems and walled gardens. Transparent code and public accountability can go much further in helping Web3 transition to a better future. By embracing the transparency of DeFi while continuing to invest in privacy-preserving technologies like zero-knowledge protocols, we can avoid situations that may lead to overreaching regulatory crackdowns while also creating safer environments for retail users and Web3 projects supporting real-world use cases.  I’ve been thinking about these issues of trust and fairer financial systems since I was building my first projects as a coder growing up in Ukraine. I believe in Web3 because I want to build systems that are not easily corrupted or subject to takeover by a bad actor. I want citizens of the entire globe to be able to control their own assets and data rather than having to trust an untrustworthy bank or getting shut out of the system entirely because of their native nation’s economic status.  After the events of the last week, I believe more than ever that the world needs Web3 to build a better digital infrastructure for the planet. FTX is not crypto.

Magic Eden, which currently supports Solana and Ethereum-based NFTs, will usher in gaming communities by integrating collectibles minted on the layer 2 blockchain network. The chain is supported by Web3 gaming publishers such as Atari, Decentraland, The Sandbox and more.  Polygon has also recently forged partnerships with fintech companies Stripe and Robinhood, as well as software company Adobe, highlighting its use cases across Web2 and Web3 companies.

To achieve these goals, Magic Eden will roll out a launchpad and marketplace to support Web3 game publishers building on Polygon using its native MATIC token.  Magic Eden’s expansion comes as the NFT community continues to debate the importance of creator royalties.

The integration of Polygon NFTs may help bring more trading volume back to the platform despite mixed sentiments about dropping royalty payments.

Prices of most crypto assets are maintaining a southward movement over the past weeks. The collapse of FTX is still spinning the wheels negatively as the contagion spreads. Related Reading: These Bitcoin Metrics Signal A Capitulation Event Is Near Glassnode, a blockchain analytics company, reports more doubts about the crypto market. On November 21, the firm concluded its ‘Week on-chain’ report and disclosed the impact of the market crisis on Bitcoin holders. In its report, the firm checked the total increase in the Mean Inflow Volume to many exchanges and discovered that many whales are losing. Its report also shows that the average deposits on top exchanges increase in dollars as Bitcoin reaches its lowest levels/bottom. The firm noted that the trend has been existing since May this year. This resembles the bear market of 2018/19. Also, Glassnode stated that the report indicates more considerable dominance on exchange deposits from whales, trading firms, and institutions. The Rise Of An Old Pattern The analysis of the previous bear market shows a mirroring of the events. The prices of BTC went down by 84% from their ATH. But within a year, the token bottomed out as it moved from $20,000 to $3,200 in November 2018. The primary crypto asset follows a similar pattern in its timing. BTC has dipped by 77.3% from its ATH of $69K in Nov 2021 to a new cycle low of $15,665 in November 2022. There’s still a different opinion on the trend for Bitcoin from analysts who believe in more time left. They relied on the asset several months after the 2018 bear market before witnessing a considerable bullish rise. In 2018, Bitcoin took five weeks before hitting bottom after the start of the capitulation. $BTC Did you know that it took 5 weeks to finally hit the bottom once we started to capitulate in 2018?

LTC’s price continues to look strong despite bearish market sentiments, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. LTC’s price looks strong and continues to hold above the daily 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The price action displayed by Litecoin (LTC) has been a joy to watch, holding up nicely above the daily range price channel it has formed in the last few weeks despite the uncertainty in the market. The market continued to look like a fairytale, with many traders and investors disheartened, following the collapse of the FTX effect affecting small crypto projects like Genesis as the market continues to look weak on each passing day signifying the bottom is not yet leading to the price of many altcoins declining. Despite the Domino effect of FTX, this has had less effect on Litecoin (LTC) as it continues to show its strength to rally higher. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: XRP Price Holds Ground While BTC and ETH Slide, Here’s Breakout Zone Litecoin (LTC) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases in the case of LTC looking much different as the price of LTC continues to show bullish price actions as price eyes a rally to a region of $70-$80. FTX and Genesis’s news have hugely impacted the price of altcoins, including LTC, sending the price into a spiral movement to a region of $50 as the price bounced off this region to reclaim $60. After the price of LTC closed above the weekly high of $60, there are high chances of the market going higher, with the prices of LTC looking more with the weekly open. Weekly resistance for the price of LTC – $80. Weekly support for the price of LTC – $60. Price Analysis Of LTC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of LTC remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $60 resistance after bouncing off from the region of $50 on several instances, giving bear more of a sense of belief before rallying to $63. The price of LTC trades at $67; the price needs to hold strong above this region for the price to rally to a high of $80, where it would face resistance to trend higher. If the price of LTC breaks below $60, we could see more sell-off, as this has been an area of interest to hold off bears. Daily resistance for the LTC price – $80. Daily support for the LTC price – $60. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Bulls And Bears Tussle At $1,000; Will Bears Come Top?

42414826,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBN1Mw,1669123289,Tornado Cash Developer Alexey Pertsev to Remain in Jail Until at Least Late Februrary,"‘S-HERTOGENBOSCH, Netherlands – Alexey Pertsev has been ordered to stay in jail until Feb. 20 after a Netherlands court found the Tornado Cash developer represented a flight risk.  Pertsev has been held in detention since August, days after the U.S. Treasury used sanction powers against the Tornado protocol, which it said had been used to launder over a billion dollars' worth of cryptocurrencies and to support North Korean hackers.  At the hearing on Tuesday, Dutch public prosecutor Martine Boerlage announced money-laundering charges for the first time. Boerlage had said little more about the case than a press release, but has now accused Pertsev of facilitating the processing of dirty money by writing the Tornado Cash code.  Boerlage brushed aside arguments that Tornado Cash was a decentralized protocol that Pertsev was powerless to control, claiming that it was in fact one and the same as PepperSec, a company Pertsev worked for alongside fellow developers Roman Semenov and Roman Storm.  Outside the courtroom, Pertsev’s lawyer, Keith Cheng, told CoinDesk he was “very disappointed” with the decision.  “It's clear to us that these judges are not as familiar with the subject matter as they should be,” Cheng said. “At the moment, the case law regarding criminal activities is all about bitcoin mixers … It's very important that the court understands that Tornado Cash is something different.”  Pertsev’s arrest and detention has drawn widespread outcry, including protests in Amsterdam and a tweet from Edward Snowden, an American who now lives in Russia after he leaked documents from the National Security Agency, comparing Pertsev’s treatment to the kid gloves afforded to executives at collapsed crypto exchange FTX.  ‘Clear-cut’  “If you peel everything off, what we have here is a fairly clear-cut money-laundering case,” Boerlage said, citing laws that forbid the concealment of funds’ origin and movement. “That's exactly what a mixing service like Tornado Cash does for you.”  Boerlage compared the vast sums of money deposited into the protocol after the Ronin Bridge hack with a bank clerk unquestioningly accepting a pile of 100 euro notes for deposit.  “If you as a bank don't know where the money is coming from and haven't yet built in any mechanism to look at that, then there’s a considerable likelihood that your service is laundering money,” she said.  Boerlage also denied claims that the software was autonomous, saying that Pertsev and others had de facto control.  That Pertsev “has nothing to do with Tornado Cash, can be relegated to the realm of fantasy,” the prosecutor said. Pertsev, Semenov and Storm may have held so many tokens for the protocol they could in practice ”always outvote everyone else” when it came to decision making, Boerlage added.  Private chats obtained by the prosecutor between the three showed that in practice they made operational decisions about the protocol, and had effectively acknowledged they were involved in “shady stuff” when they discussed tweeting about how to circumvent money-laundering norms, she said.  “PepperSec is Tornado Cash,” Boerlage added, referring to Pertsev’s idea that he could be released to return to his previous employer as long as he declined to work on the protocol.  Cheng, meanwhile, argued that the service had legitimate uses.  “The goal of Tornado Cash is to bring privacy for the user, giving the user control over crypto transactions,” Cheng said. The prosecution had not convincingly demonstrated specific facts linking Pertsev to the alleged crime as required by Dutch and European law, Cheng added.  Pertsev himself spoke little, though, speaking through a Russian interpreter, confirmed his personal details and referred to the online petition and demonstrations that have been held in his support.  “I am ready to accept all restrictions” should he be released on bail, he said, before his request was declined. “I just want to be able to spend Christmas with my wife.”  Read more: US Treasury Adds to Tornado Cash Sanctions With North Korea WMD Allegations  Update (Nov. 22, 2022 14:35 UTC): Adds details throughout article.

42414830,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBN1cr,1669123065,Bitcoin Mining Giant Core Scientific Ended October With $32M in Cash,"Core Scientific (CORZ), the world's largest publicly listed miner by computing power, ended October with $32.2 million in cash and 62 BTC ($975,000) and reiterated that it may run out of money before the end of the year.  The company first warned of bankruptcy risk about a month ago, sending its shares plummeting about 80% on Nasdaq. The miner had 1,051 BTC and $29.5 million in cash at the end of September.  Core Scientific is one of several miners struggling to keep afloat as rising energy prices increase costs, and a stubbornly low bitcoin price slashes revenue. Compute North filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September, and Iris Energy has received a notice of default on its loans. Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Greenidge Generation (GREE) have also said they are strapped for cash.  ""We anticipate that existing cash resources will be depleted by the end of 2022 or sooner,"" Core Scientific said in its third-quarter earnings report, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. ""Depending on our assumptions regarding the timing and ability to achieve more normalized levels of operating revenue, the estimates of amounts of required liquidity vary significantly. Similarly, it is very difficult to predict when or if bitcoin prices will recover or energy costs will abate.""  The mining firm is in talks with creditors to restructure its debt and raise capital. One lender, BlockFi, has been caught in the crossfire of crypto exchange FTX's collapse. The exchange had promised to bail out BlockFi with a $400 million credit facility, and that's now not likely to materialize. Core Scientific had about $54 million outstanding to BlockFi as of Sept. 30.  Core Scientific has been affected by the bankruptcy of lender Celsius's mining arm, one of its biggest clients. Celsius Mining filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July, and in September sued Core Scientific claiming that it violated automatic stay terms. Core Scientific claims Celsius owes it $5.2 million as of Sept. 30.  Two other companies sued CORZ in November: Sphere 3D (ANY) and McCarthy Building Companies. A class-action lawsuit was filed in the same month in Texas courts alleging failures to disclose important information to investors.  The miner was running 232,000 machines in its facilities as of the end of the quarter, accounting for 13 exahash per second (EH/s) of bitcoin self-mining computing power, or hashrate, and 9.5 EH/s of hosted machines for other firms, according to the filing. That's 8.6% of the global hashrate.

The troubled trading firm sought funding from Binance and Apollo Global Management, according to the Wall Street Journal. Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, declined to invest, citing potential conflicts of interest. A Genesis representative, however, told Bloomberg that ""we have no plans to file bankruptcy imminently.”  The initial news sent bitcoin to a fresh two-year low of $15,480. Since then, the price has remained at about $15,650.(Genesis and CoinDesk share the same parent company, Digital Currency Group.)  Sam Bankman-Fried’s crumbling FTX empire held $1.2 billion in cash reserves as of Sunday, court documents show. That is far below the $3.1 billion it owes to its top 50 creditors. About $751 million of that is held in debtor entities, and the rest, $488 million, is in non-debtor entities, according to the document, which was filed on Monday. About $514 million is unrestricted cash, $260 million is custodial, and $465 million is restricted cash that is earmarked for specific purposes like loan repayments and can't be used for general business purposes.  Coinbase shares have sunk to an all-time low. The U.S. crypto exchange went public in April 2021, and its shares have lost nearly 90% over the past year, with the FTX contagion causing the latest leg down. The stock dropped 10% to $40.62 on Monday, and it is down 39% in November. Coinbase's shares traded at slightly over $400 last year on the day the company went public on Nasdaq.  Chart of the Day  The chart above shows an increase in the volume of on-chain transfers of bitcoin that have been inactive for at least six months, a sign of long-term holders losing conviction, according to Glassnode.  A total of 254,000 BTC older than six months appears to have changed hands since the collapse of FTX.

42414827,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBN1SF,1669122599,UK Lawmakers Vote to Widen Authorities’ Powers in Seizing Crypto-Related Property,"Lawmakers in the U.K. voted on Tuesday to grant authorities wider powers to seize property containing information that can help identify crypto assets related to crime.  The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill, which is being debated in Parliament, already included rules to give authorities powers to seize cryptocurrencies tied to criminal activity.  New amendments accepted by lawmakers in the House of Commons (the lower chamber of Parliament) seek to give local law enforcement powers to also seize “crypto asset-related items,” which are items of property that contain or give access to information that could help assist in the seizure of targeted crypto assets.  “What this bill is doing is making sure that those assets that are held in crypto can be seized like other assets,” Tom Tugendhat, the minister of state responsible for crime and terrorism regulation, said during Tuesday’s line-by-line reading of the bill.  The same amendment makes it an offense to assault or resist an accredited financial investigator trying to seize a crypto-related item. Yet another amendment accepted on Tuesday to the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 ensures courts across the U.K. can ask authorities to seize and freeze crypto tied to crime. Measures that will ensure seized assets aren't released until legal proceedings are concluded were also added to the bill.  “We should prioritize tightening regulation and enforcement by cracking down on the widespread use of such assets to defraud individuals and undermine our national security,” said Stephen Kinnock, shadow minister of the Home Office department, which deals with security matters.  The U.K. National Police Chiefs' Council, a law-enforcement body, has said it has already seized “millions of pounds worth of cryptocurrency assets” and has crypto advisers in police departments all over the country.  Rulemakers for crypto worldwide are closely eyeing the sector amid this year’s market downturn and this month's collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Although the FTX fallout may be prompting regulators to establish tougher controls over the industry, it is unclear if stricter rules would have prevented FTX’s demise.  ""It's certainly arguable that FTX got into difficulties for other reasons other than lack of regulation. I'll leave it there,"" Tugendhat said.  The bill still has to pass the House of Commons and go through the upper chamber of Parliament before it becomes law.

Most notably, the insolvency fate of Genesis Trading, DCG and Grayscale is hovering over the Bitcoin market like a sword of Damocles. This uncertainty is especially evident in the cohort of Bitcoin whales and long-term holders. As Glassnode notes in its latest report, recent on-chain data suggests that “the confidence and financial position of whales and Bitcoin old hands have been shaken by the event.” Whales, institutions and trading firms are taking a larger share of exchange deposits, according to Glassnode. The average deposit size across all major exchanges has increased significantly. Related Reading: These Bitcoin Metrics Signal A Capitulation Event Is Near This is a trend that has been seen in other late stages of a bear market, such as that of 2018-19. Also, a resembling trend was evident in late May after the collapse of LUNA-UST project. Glassnode concludes from the data that a driving factor could be the financial situation of Whales (holders > 1k BTC). The average payout price of the whale cohort since the inception of Binance, on July 5, 2017, is currently $17,825. With the spot price currently below $16,000, this is the first time since March 2020 that the whale cohort has had an unrealized loss. “In response, Whales have actually been depositing coins to exchanges, with an excess of between 5k and 7k BTC per day in net inflows over the past week,” Glassnode said. Not Only Bitcoin Whales Show Weak Hands However, not only whales, but also long-term holders are experiencing weak hands at the moment. Thus, spending by Bitcoin long-term holders is on the rise. According to Glassnode, the Spent Volume Age Bands (SVAB) metric shows that just over 4% of total volume spent this week came from coins older than three months, which is the highest level in 2022. “This relative magnitude is coincident with some of the largest in history, often seen during capitulation events and wide scale panic events”, according to the research firm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend Overwhelmingly Negative, Bears Target $13K At its fifth highest level historically are the BTC volume older than 6-months. As Glassnode notes, over 130,600 BTC were spent on November 17 alone. The 7-day average is now 50,100 BTC per day. Since the collapse of FTX, a total of 254,000 BTC older than 6 months have been spent. This represents about 1.3% of the circulating supply. On a 30-day basis, this is the highest since the bull market in January 2021, when long-term investors took profits. According to Glassnode, it remains to be seen if the current on-chain trends are short-term in nature or if a profound loss of confidence in the Bitcoin market is taking place, triggered by the Sam Bankman-Fried fraud scheme: [A] slow-down and retrace of these metrics would signify this may be a short-term event, however with each passing day that these trends persist, it becomes increasingly plausible that a wider scale reduction in confidence is in play.

The token dropped 17% to a two-year low of 40 cents early Tuesday before erasing the losses with a V-shaped recovery. At press time, the token had returned to positive territory for the day, changing hands at 53 cents, according to CoinDesk data.  The number of CRV held in centralized exchange wallets has increased by 70% to a record 148.9 million this month, with the tally surging by 46% in the past 24 hours alone, according to data tracked by Glassnode.  In other words, the number of CRV available for liquidation on centralized exchanges has substantially increased. Investors typically transfer coins from their wallets to exchanges when intending to sell their positions.  Developments in the CRV market are notable, as Curve, which specializes in stablecoin swaps, is the biggest source of liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi). That means any issue at Curve can have broader market implications.  CRV's exchange balance has surged amid reports of a large investor transferring large number of borrowed tokens to centralized exchanges.  According to several Twitter-based researchers, including Lookonchain, the investor recently borrowed 20 million CRV from the DeFi lending giant Aave and transferred half of that to OKEx, possibly to sell the cryptocurrency. The balance held on OKEx has increased by 11.3 million this month, according to Glassnode data.  The latest edition of the Curve newsletter has referred to the activity as a ""big short"".  CRV's near-term prospects appear to be bleak as the uptick in the exchange's balance is accompanied by a lack of incentive to hold the token or provide liquidity on Curve.  ""While Curve was initially a winner after FTX, a lack of user engagement will now hurt them in the short term,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto-services provider Matrixport, said, referring to the collapse this month of crypto exchange FTX. ""There is less interest from users to provide their tokens into liquidity pools and even lock them up in terms of total value locked.""  ""Genesis and DCG are adding to the risk of a fire sale for individual tokens,"" Thielen added, referring to Genesis Global Trading and its parent, Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk. Genesis is facing liquidity issues.  Curve saw massive outflows between Nov. 8 and Nov. 13 as FTX went bust, injecting volatility and uncertainty into markets. The total value locked in Curve has declined to $3.78 billion, the lowest since February 2021.",NEGATIVE,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | CRV | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/22/curves-crv-token-slides-17-as-exchange-balance-hits-record-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57f0514e8410cadec788e2604472f08f712ed4e4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This is not the kind of news traders and investors want to read about. The long-awaited World Cup clearly had no compensating effect on the prevailing economic conditions. Here’s A Quick Rundown Of How CHZ Is Doing: – Readily available data indicates a strong bear market hindered CHZ’s rally – Near 1:1 ratio of long vs short positions shows cautious support for the token – Price continues to fall; bulls should defend at $0.1664 and $0.1554 The token’s value has dropped significantly as of this writing. CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap report that CHZ has dropped another 9% since yesterday. The token is trading at a red candle price of $0.1780, which is also reflected in the charts. CHZ’s rehabilitation may be more challenging now that the World Cup has become controversial over multiple issues. Related Reading: Avalanche TVL Hits 271 Million AVAX, Following Weeks Of Setbacks Chiliz May Come Up With A Surprise While CHZ is expected to rise, the token’s value has declined after reaching a high on November 19. This was the day before the World Cup began. Nonetheless, CHZ may prove more resilient than market participants anticipate. First and foremost, CryptoQuant data indicates that the token’s exchange reserves are low. This means that fewer CHZ tokens are available on exchanges and are being prepared for sale on the market. According to CoinGlass statistics, this is accompanied by an almost 1:1 ratio of long positions to short ones. These are incredibly bullish claims, and the technicals mirror the token’s resiliency. As the price continued to decline, the money flow index increased, indicating that a price pullback may occur during the next few days. Nonetheless, because of unfavorable market circumstances, the MFI may misread, resulting in extra suffering. As of writing, the bears are aiming for a breakout at the 61.80 Fib level ($0.1664) Longer Rough Road Ahead? The expansion of the Bollinger band, indicating a greater-than-usual degree of market volatility, along with the CMF index’s recent crossing into the negative half of its range, could be grounds for lower pricing. CHZ bulls should defend the $0.1664 level because the moving averages are displaying strong sell signals. If the bears break through, $0.1554 will provide more support. The actual relief rally for CHZ will not occur in the near future. However, as indicated by the proportion of long to short positions, investors and traders are willing to sacrifice short-term profit for a greater long-term benefit. With CHZ’s limited foreign exchange reserves, we anticipate the aforementioned supports to delay or halt the downward market.

ETH’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. ETH’s price looks weak as the price struggles to hold above $1,000, with the possibility of reclaiming the daily and weekly 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) remaining bleak. The price action displayed by Ethereum (ETH) has continued to look like a fairytale, with many traders and investors disheartened, following the collapse of the FTX effect affecting small crypto projects like Genesis as the market continues to look weak on each passing day signifying the bottom is not yet in leading to the price of many altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) as the price continues to hang on a balance, battling for survival. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors has left the market at a standstill as the market has yet to make a major move after previous weeks saw the price of ETH struggling to hold above $30. Most altcoins have lost their key support and have traded with over 90% loss, with many hoping for a crypto revival.

The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases in the case of ETH worsening, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. FTX and Genesis’s news have hugely impacted the price of ETH, sending the price into a spiral movement to a region of $1,050 as the price struggles to stay above $1,000. After the price of ETH closed below the weekly high of $1,200, there are high chances of the market going lower, with the prices of SOL looking more bearish with the weekly open. Weekly resistance for the price of ETH – $1,200. Weekly support for the price of ETH – $1,000-$900. Price Analysis Of ETH On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of ETH remains considerably weak in the daily timeframe as the price trades below the $1,200 resistance after bouncing off from the region of $1,000 on several instances, giving bear more belief of pushing price lower to a region of $900-$800. Rumor building of a likely bankruptcy of Genesis could affect the price of ETH and other smaller assets, with the price facing a possibility of losing the region of $700-$600 in case things gets out of hand. If the price of ETH breaks below $900, we could see more sell-off, as this has been an area of interest to hold off bears. Daily resistance for the ETH price – $1,200.

42414837,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBN28h,1669111525,Crypto Financial Services Firm Eqonex Files for Voluntary Debt Restructuring in Singapore,"Eqonex (EQOS), a Nasdaq-listed crypto financial services firm, filed a voluntary application with the High Court in Singapore to place the company into judicial management.  In a Monday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Eqonex said its Hong Kong-based entity, Diginex, has been placed into creditors’ voluntary liquidation and Eqonex Capital in Singapore is also expected to enter voluntary liquidation.  The company signed a strategic partnership with Bifinity, a payments technology firm owned by crypto exchange Binance, in March as it began preparing to focus on custody, brokerage and asset management. Bifinity agreed to provide a $36 million loan that could be converted into equity and Jonathan Farnell, former head of U.K. operations at Binance, became CEO. Due to technical breaches of the loan agreement, Bifinity withheld the fifth tranche of the loan.  “In order to address these liquidity issues, the group has been in negotiation with potential investors to obtain equity financing through the issuance of new shares, and in negotiation with Bifinity seeking, amongst other things, a waiver of breaches and an amendment of terms under the loan agreement. Unfortunately, despite the group’s best efforts, these negotiations have not been successful,” the company said.  Other units of the group, including Bletchley Park Asset Management and Digivault, are not in insolvency proceedings. Digivault, a custodian registered with the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, will start a voluntary wind-down and will try to find an alternative solution. Eqonex closed its crypto exchange in August, citing extreme market volatility and declining trading volumes, saying it planned to focus on its asset management and custody.  Judicial management is a type of restructuring in which an independent overseer is appointed to handle a company that cannot meet its debt obligations.  The company’s shares fell almost 24% yesterday, as contagion fears engulfed the crypto market. They have tumbled 91% this year. When Eqonex listed in October 2020 it was the first Nasdaq company with a cryptocurrency exchange.  Ensuring the company was properly regulated at a time that “grow-at-all cost” development characterized the crypto space may have hurt its ability to grow as fast as it wanted, the company said in a letter to shareholders posted on its website.  ""We must now acknowledge that we have not delivered on the ambitious goals we set for ourselves as one of the first listed, regulated digital asset ecosystems,"" it said.

4627876,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509663,1669109226,These Bitcoin Metrics Signal A Capitulation Event Is Near,"Several metrics currently suggest that the Bitcoin price is finally finding its bottom after another capitulation event, possibly triggered by the Genesis/ DCG/ Grayscale saga. This final miner capitulation may be imminent as miners are selling their BTC at the fastest rate since early 2016. In light of the new bear market low, some Bitcoin miners are currently going through arguably the most difficult time ever. The BTC price fell to a new bear market low yesterday at $15,478, putting it in no-man’s land. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading just above the low, at $15,678. According to Charles Edwards, founder of the Capriole Fund, selling pressure among BTC miners has skyrocketed 400% in the last three weeks. As a result, a ” Bitcoin miner bloodbath” is currently playing out. Miners are selling their Bitcoins more aggressively than they have in seven years. “If the price doesn’t go up soon, a lot of bitcoin miners are going to give up,” the fund manager stated, adding: What we are currently seeing is not sustainable. Mine-and-hodl is not a viable strategy as a bitcoin miner. Miners are paying the consequences of the “never sell” arrogance that was prevalent just 6 months ago. They need to constantly manage (trade) their bitcoin position in this market. Data from Glassnode backs up Edwards’ claims. They show that miners’ total balances fell to a 10-month low this week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Only Temporary As All Roads Lead To $15,000 This is due to miners being forced to sell some of their BTC to cover their running costs at the current very low price. Their holdings are now worth about $30.4 billion, which is still almost 10% of Bitcoin supply. Bitcoin miners are currently facing multiple challenges. The hash rate is near an all-time high, as well as the mining difficulty. Ultimately, numerous miners are suffering from the sharp rise in energy prices. All together, plus the weak Bitcoin price, are best breeding ground for a renewed miner capitulation. However, Edwards is also seeing a huge opportunity in this scenario.

""We expect bitcoin to outperform in the coming months,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, said in a note to clients after considering the bitcoin-ether ratio's recent move above the 50-day simple moving average (MA).  Stockton's forecast is at odds with several fundamental analysts who expect ether to outperform bitcoin in the wake of ETH's newfound deflationary cryptocurrency appeal.  The bitcoin-ether ratio crossed above the 50-day MA on Sunday and stood at 14.50 at press time.  The 50-day MA, one of the most commonly tracked technical lines, has historically been reliable as a breakout point. The ratio's three of the previous four moves above the average brought sharp gains.  The latest breakout validates the bullish ""higher low"" of 12.70 created early this month. A higher low is formed when selling runs out of steam at a level higher than the preceding price low and is considered the first signal of an impending bearish-to-bullish trend change.  ""The bitcoin versus Ether ratio has cleared the 50-day MA after making a higher low earlier this month,"" Stockton said. ""Next resistance for the ratio is at the 200-day MA, a breakout above which would target the June highs, with little resistance in between.""

With the license from the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), Bitpanda Asset Management GmbH can independently offer crypto custody, as well as proprietary trading for crypto assets for German residents, the company said in a press release.  ""Additionally, Bitpanda will be able to maintain an order book and directly market services for crypto assets, enabling them to provide a secure and regulated environment for German customers to invest in a wide range of cryptocurrencies,"" the company said.  Regulators worldwide are closely watching the crypto industry as it reels from its latest upset – the fall of crypto exchange giant FTX. Germany is a member of the European Union, which recently finalized its comprehensive framework for supervising crypto issuers and service providers looking to operate in the any of the 27 member states of the trade bloc.  Since FTX filed for bankruptcy in the U.S., Stefan Berger, the German lawmaker who was in charge of shepherding the draft legislation through the European Parliament, has said the EU's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), should be the global standard for crypto regulation.  But MiCA won't take effect until at least 2024, and EU countries like Germany and France are continuing to issue local regulatory licenses – although the latter has said it will start winding down the local regime in preparation for MiCA.  Bitpanda, which became Austria's first fintech unicorn last year, has received regulatory approval in a number of European countries including Austria, France, Italy, Spain, the U.K., Czech Republic and Sweden.  The German license was months in the making, Bitpanda co-founder and CEO Eric Demuth said in a statement to the press.  ""That means being regulated and it means a strict separation of customer and company assets, which is sadly not the case everywhere these days,” Demuth said, seemingly referring to reports that say FTX misused customer funds for conducting risky trades.

About $751 million of that is held in debtor entities and the rest, $488 million, is in non-debtor entities, according to the document, filed on Monday by FTX's proposed financial advisor, Alvarez & Marsal North America. About $514 million is unrestricted cash, $260 million is custodial and $465 million is restricted cash, which is earmarked for specific purposes like loan repayments and can't be use for general business purposes.  Crypto exchange FTX fell from grace over the past couple of weeks after CoinDesk's revelation that a big chunk of sister company Alameda Research's assets were the crypto exchange's tokens.

The disgraced exchange has also been criticized by its new CEO, John J. Ray III, who has previously supervised financial scandals such as Enron.

CoinGecko statistics shows that LINK is still giving off critical sell signals. The token’s current price of $5.70 doesn’t help, either. According to data compiled by CryptoQuant, however, the amount of tokens held in exchange have substantially dwindled during the past several days. Oversold RSI and Stoch RSI readings, together with other positive indicators, point to a likely trend reversal in the next several days. As the situation improves, the commodities channel index is also rising, indicating a likely improvement in asset confidence. However, LINK’s DMI remains negative with a -DMI of 25.54 and an ADX of 26. According to the RSI and Stoch RSI readings, this indicates that the downtrend is still strong and that a little reversal is unlikely. In spite of the negative market, these factors show what appears to be a bright near future for LINK. LINK’s price action is located at the bottom of the central Bollinger band, indicating volatility. This means that the price will continue to decline from its current market position. Chaikin’s money flow index indicates total bearish control at -0.13, although MFI readings follow LINK’s RSI, further indicating an imminent pullback. The Unstable Link Although there are numerous indicators suggesting that the token will rally, there are also numerous technical indicators pointing to a bleaker future for LINK. Knowing this, proceeding with caution and keeping an eye on the leading cryptocurrencies can aid in making a buy-or-sell choice. Nonetheless, investors and traders should not anticipate a relief rally at this time. Expect more pain in LINK as the bear market continues, but this little respite will give LINK holders hope for a positive long-term outlook.

42413634,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA8cW,1669084007,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Falls to 2-Year Low on Renewed Contagion Fears,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin fell to a fresh two-year low as crypto traders speculated over the future of Genesis Global, a victim of the fallout from the recent collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange.  Insights: Singapore's central bank is facing uncomfortable questions about its regulatory treatment of FTX.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Crypto markets are on edge as traders speculate over the fate of yet another victim of the fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange.  Genesis Global, a once-mighty crypto trading and lending firm, was reportedly in talks to raise fresh capital after it halted customer withdrawals last week. The case is being closely monitored by digital-asset traders partly because Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), which also owns Grayscale Investments, manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is the largest publicly traded bitcoin fund. The speculation is that Genesis's financial straits might put DCG in the position of needing to dispose of assets, which under various scenarios might affect GBTC and spill over into the bitcoin market. (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of DCG.)  ""We expect the DCG/Genesis capital raise will be the big market moving event this week,"" Nauman Sheikh, head of treasury management at Wave Financial. ""A favorable outcome would lead to a market squeeze and an unfavorable outcome has the potential to do some serious damage.""  A Bloomberg report that Genesis had mentioned bankruptcy as a potential option briefly sent bitcoin (BTC) to a fresh two-year low of $15,480, but the price was back to about $15,900 as of press time.  The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar, reported that Genesis sought funding from Binance and Apollo Global Management, and that Binance declined to invest, citing potential conflicts of interest.  ""We have no plans to file bankruptcy imminently,"" a Genesis spokesperson said. ""Our goal is to resolve the current situation consensually without the need for any bankruptcy filing. Genesis continues to have constructive conversations with creditors.""  Mike Dershewitz, head of risk committee at Arca Funds, wrote Monday: ""DCG can also sell off a portion of its Grayscale equity. Assuming $300 million in annual net income, this cash flow stream should be worth at least $2.5 billion, depending on how a would-be investor/buyer values the longevity of this cash-flow stream.""  Insights  Singaporean regulators under scrutiny after FTX collapse  The collapse of the FTX exchange forced the Monetary Authority of Singapore last week to address what it characterized as “questions and misperceptions” about its prior regulatory treatment of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto-trading venue.  One narrative centers on whether FTX received favorable treatment from the island nation’s central bank. Singapore's state investment fund, Temasek, had a $210 million investment in FTX that it has now written off entirely.  A key question is why Binance.sg – an affiliate of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume – was placed on an Investor Alert List (IAL), while FTX was not.  Recently, the regulator released a 15-point statement addressing the issue. Central to the regulator’s argument is that Binance was actively soliciting Singapore residents, while FTX was not.  Except, this is not entirely the case.  MAS says one of the reasons is that Binance supported the Singapore dollar (SGD) in order to onboard Singapore-based users, and FTX didn’t.  FTX began support for the SGD as an asset class a few weeks before its demise according to a list of supported assets. Users would still have to wire in USD, unlike Binance.SG, which supported local payment gateways.  FTX-owned Liquid also supports the StraitsX XSGD stablecoin to, in the words of the exchange, “better serve our Singapore trading community.”  MAS also said that Binance solicited Singaporean users because of advertising campaigns directed at them.  And yet FTX did the same.  Token 2049, a major crypto conference that took place in the halcyon days of September 2022, counted FTX as one of its sponsors. The exchange’s logo-adorned swag was visible throughout the venue to anyone in attendance.  Days after the Token 2049 conference was the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix, which saw the FTX-sponsored Mercedes-AMG Petronas team compete – complete with the exchange’s logos available on the car and drivers’ hats for everyone to see.

SOL’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. SOL’s price looks weak as the price struggles to hold above $10, with the possibility of reclaiming the daily and weekly 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) remaining bleak. The price action displayed by Solana (SOL) has continued to look like a fairytale, with many traders and investors disheartened, following the collapse of the FTX effect affecting small crypto projects like Genesis as the market continues to look weak on each passing day signifying the bottom is not yet in leading to the price of many altcoins, including Solana (SOL) as the price continues to hang on a balance, battling for survival. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors has left the market at a standstill as the market has yet to make a major move after previous weeks saw the price of SOL struggling to hold above $30. Most altcoins have lost their key support and have traded with over 90% loss, with many hoping for a crypto revival. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Has A High Chance Of Resting At $16,000 Solana (SOL) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases with the case of SOL worsening, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. FTX and now Genesis news has hugely impacted the price of SOL, sending the price into a spiral movement to a region of $11 as the price struggles to stay above $10. After the price of SOL closed below the weekly high of $20, there are high chances of the market going lower, with the prices of SOL looking more bearish with the weekly open. Weekly resistance for the price of SOL – $20. Weekly support for the price of SOL – $5. Price Analysis Of SOL On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of SOL remains considerably weak in the daily timeframe as the price trades below the $20 resistance after bouncing off from the region of $15 on several instances. Rumor building of a likely bankruptcy of Genesis could affect the price of SOL and other smaller assets, with the price facing a possibility of losing the region of $5-$6. If the price of SOL breaks below $10, we could see more sell-off, as this has been an area of interest to hold off bears. Daily resistance for the SOL price – $15-$20. Daily support for the SOL price – $5. Related Reading: FTX Hacker Mobilizes Ethereum Again, Lock And Loaded For The Dump?

Adding to the issue is Grayscale's unwillingness to offer proof of reserves for the assets it holds through Coinbase. Related parties own much less ETHE than GBTC and the other SEC-reporting Grayscale trusts. Sell pressure from the parent shouldn't be as extreme. The Grayscale crypto trusts have been in freefall and we're starting to get some theories as to why. Grayscale has over a dozen single-asset crypto funds that trade publicly over the counter. Of those 13 single-asset funds, 8 are SEC-reporting. All of them have been beat up over the last week specifically with contagion concerns following the FTX (FTT-USD) collapse being the main driver of the panic. The cryptos underlying each of these funds have performed very poorly since FTX but the Grayscale funds have done even worse with many of them down over 30%. 1 Month Performance (Seeking Alpha) The significant drawdown in Grayscale fund shares over the last couple weeks has made an already large discount to net asset value in most of these funds even bigger. Grayscale's Ethereum Trust ( OTCQX:ETHE ) closed Friday at a 45% discount to NAV, by far the biggest discount in the fund's history. Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) didn't do much better, trading at roughly the same discount. Data by YCharts There are two core concerns that are making matters worse for the Grayscale NAV discounts. The first is much of the contagion concerns in the Grayscale funds stem from issues at Genesis - a crypto trading firm that is owned by Digital Currency Group, or DCG. Genesis is reportedly looking to raise $1 billion very quickly and some speculators are now assuming this means there will be pressure on DCG to liquidate Grayscale funds. There has even been speculation online that DCG might have to dissolve Grayscale entirely to make Genesis whole if the company can't come up with funding it needs to apparently survive. The Lack of Proof of Reserves The second major concern pressuring shares is the belief by some that Grayscale may not actually have the crypto that it claims. These concerns became loud enough late last week that Grayscale published a post called "" Safety, Security, and Transparency "" late Friday. The post centered on these four major points that were outlined at the beginning: The holdings of Grayscale’s digital asset products are safe and secure. Each of Grayscale’s digital asset products is set up as a separate legal entity All digital assets that underlie Grayscale’s digital asset products are held by Coinbase ( COIN ) Custody Trust Company, LLC The organizational documents governing each of Grayscale’s digital asset products, as well as the custodian agreement with Coinbase Custody, prohibit the digital assets underlying the products from being lent, borrowed, or otherwise encumbered. Number 4 is the big one and bold is my emphasis. Two weeks ago, this would have likely been a strong enough assurance that the crypto is where Grayscale says it is and the market panic would cease. But we live in a post-FTX world now and assurances no longer cut it. The market wants proof of reserves and Grayscale isn't offering that even as other firms like Kucoin and Binance ( BNB-USD ) are showing their wallet addresses publicly. NAV Discount Problem The discount to NAV problem in the Grayscale funds has been well documented. I've personally covered it previously here , here , and here . It was actually the core reason why I said to stay away from GBTC in late 2019. People often blame the management fees for the discount but the bigger issue is that the funds do not offer redemptions. It was viewed by many as a big deal when GBTC was trading at a 30% discount after 3 Arrows Capital had to dump its position. In my opinion, at a NAV discount now approaching 50%, this is getting preposterous unless you believe Grayscale and/or Coinbase are both playing fast and loose with custody figures. Grayscale and DCG have both been aware of the NAV discount problem and have taken steps to try to mitigate it. Grayscale has unsuccessfully attempted to convert the fund to an ETF multiple times and is now suing the SEC for not approving the conversion of GBTC to an ETF. In another attempt to close the NAV discount, DCG started a share buyback program and is now one of the largest holders of not only GBTC, but also many of Grayscale's other funds. And this is another cause for concern. DCG Could Be Selling If the rumors are true and DCG needs money to bailout Genesis, one of the easiest ways the company can raise funds without any outside help is by liquidating the Grayscale shares that the company owns on the open market. We can see in the various 10-Q filings that related parties often own a significant amount of the Grayscale shares. From the last ETHE 10-Q earlier this month, the company disclosed just under 12 million ETHE shares held by related parties: The Trust considers the following entities, their directors, and employees to be related parties of the Trust: DCG, Genesis, Grayscale and CoinDesk Indices, Inc. As of both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 11,817,876 Shares of the Trust were held by related parties of the Trust Things get really interesting when we compare the shares held by related parties as a percentage of the shares outstanding across Grayscale's entire portfolio of single-asset products that are SEC-reporting entities: Grayscale Fund Shares Outstanding Held by related parties % of outstanding Filing Quarter Bitcoin 692,370,100 66,972,899 9.67% Q3-33 Ethereum 310,158,500 11,817,876 3.81% Q3-33 ETH Classic ( ETCG ) 13,993,800 3,266,010 23.34% Q3-33 Litecoin ( OTCQX:LTCN ) 17,204,700 1,296,956 7.54% Q3-33 Bitcoin Cash ( OTCQX:BCHG ) 34,812,900 1,786,273 5.13% Q3-33 Zcash ( OTCQX:ZCSH ) 3,777,700 883,510 23.39% Q3-33 Stellar ( OTCQX:GXLM ) 824,600 118,192 14.33% Q2-22 Horizen ( OTCQX:HZEN ) 6,838,000 3,643,924 53.29% Q2-22 Source: company filings While we don't yet have the Q3 filings for Grayscale's Horizen ( ZEN-USD ) or Stellar ( XLM-USD ) funds, I think we can safely assume the ownership figures will still be high in those filings. It's interesting to me that many of these funds have very large related party ownership percentages; some even larger than 20%. Related-party ownership of the Ethereum fund is very low by comparison. There are two potential takeaways here. First, DCG seemingly hasn't had to defend the NAV ratio to the degree that it has had to defend it in other funds - potentially indicating organic market demand for ETHE. The other potential takeaway is that if DCG has been forced to sell Grayscale funds to raise cash, it doesn't have as much ETHE compared to GBTC so the selling pressure shouldn't be as extreme. Why Buy ETHE? Grayscale has roughly $14 billion in crypto assets under management and the overwhelming majority of it is in BTC in ETH. That would be an immense amount of crypto flooding the market if Grayscale were indeed dissolved. But I'm just not seeing how that happens for a couple of reasons. First, DCG can sell the Grayscale business rather than dump the assets and pay out shareholders. Frankly, I think that's actually a fairly likely outcome if DCG is in serious desperation for cash fast and can find a buyer. The 2% management fee is a terrific business. If crypto's valuations are near a bottom, Grayscale returns $1.3 billion in revenue in just 5 years at these coin prices: Year AUM 2% fee 2023 $14,000,000,000 $280,000,000 2024 $13,720,000,000 $274,400,000 2025 $13,445,600,000 $268,912,000 2026 $13,176,688,000 $263,533,760 2027 $12,913,154,240 $258,263,085 5 year fee revenue $1,345,108,845 Wouldn't an institutional firm looking for a regulated way to enter crypto be interested in this? Perhaps a full buyout of Grayscale is possible. But I do think we have to start wondering when a much bigger institutional player will start buying the shares at the market with a discount to NAV near 50%. We already know Cathie Wood has been buying GBTC but ETHE should get eyes as well. That leads us to question number two. Why can't Grayscale allow for redemption? It currently has no plan to do so according to the same ETHE filing referenced earlier: At this time, the Trust is not operating a redemption program and is not accepting redemption requests. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. The Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program. Regulation M relief would allow for Grayscale to offer redemption from the funds. We're starting to see some pressure on Grayscale to move ahead with a Regulation M relief filing already. I've said previously in some of my articles covering Grayscale funds that if the company offered redemption, the discount to NAV would shrink considerably overnight. Risks From where I sit, the biggest justification for selling ETHE at a 45% discount to NAV is if you believe the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) isn't actually where Coinbase and Grayscale say it is. Unless Grayscale and/or Coinbase have lent out the assets even though there is specific verbiage that claims they haven't, I do believe the company's assets are secure and not at risk. Of course, as we've learned this month bad acting in this industry is a non-zero percent risk. Even though I actually do believe Grayscale has what it says it has, even I'm baffled by the company's hesitance to provide wallet addresses. That's not helping things, but I don't think it means the crypto isn't where the company says it is. The real issue for DCG doesn't appear to be Grayscale, it's Genesis. Grayscale is just caught in the crossfire because of related party concerns. Summary Again, I don't care for Grayscale's decision not to publish wallet addresses but I very much believe Grayscale has the assets they claim to. Coinbase has vouched for them. I think rumors of Grayscale not owning the assets or loaning them out is largely FUD, ""fear, uncertainty, doubt."" That said, we could still see pressure on the Grayscale shares this week. But I bought a small chunk of ETHE today. I think the discount to NAV is more an indication of how awful sentiment is in the crypto market. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Alternative.me) The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is now 21 indicating extreme fear. I think we're currently at the beginning of the final capitulation and it's manifesting in the Grayscale funds at the moment. If you are a long-term believer in crypto and high on Ethereum specifically , I think the selling is way over done. I question how much selling firepower DCG even has left in ETHE. At a 45% discount to NAV, ETHE shares have an indicated Ethereum price of $605. I highly doubt Ethereum actually gets down there and I also doubt this NAV discount can get much worse unless the funds aren't where Grayscale and Coinbase say they are. If Grayscale actually does get dissolved, I believe the net assets get sold for more than $605 and the money put into ETHE shares at this price would likely return a premium at shareholder payout. The market is in full panic mode.
