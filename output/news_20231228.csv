42391730,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfubHN,1703804780,"Terraform Labs' LUNA and MIR Tokens Are Securities, Judge Rules","A U.S. federal judge ruled on Thursday that Terraform Labs, creator of the ill-fated Terra and Luna cryptocurrencies, violated federal securities laws when it sold its cryptocurrencies to the public.  Judge Jed Rakoff of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in a summary judgment that Terraform Labs failed to register LUNA and MIR – another cryptocurrency in the Terra ecosystem – as securities.  The summary judgment could shape an eventual trial over Terraform's securities violations. Judge Rakoff denied both parties' efforts to exclude testimony from opposing expert witnesses who have studied the trading activity that led to UST's depegging in May 2022.  But the judge blocked two other defense witnesses, one of whom would have testified on activity in Terraform's custodial wallets, and the other who would have given the jury an overview of Terraform's crypto economy.  The ruling falls in line with the regulators' assertion that most cryptocurrencies ought to be classified as securities and fall under the agency's purview. The court's judgment only recognizes the SEC's right to oversee two cryptocurrencies, Luna and Mir, however.  Terraform Labs believes tokens in consideration are not securities.  ""We strongly disagree with the decision and do not believe that the UST stablecoin or the other tokens at issue are securities. Further, the SEC’s fraud claims are not supported by evidence, and we will continue to vigorously defend against those meritless allegations at trial,"" Terraform Labs' spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email.  The SEC sued Terraform Labs earlier this year, following a rash of similar complaints it filed against several other key players in the cryptocurrency industry. The lawsuit's filing came just months after the notorious depegging of Terraform Labs' algorithmic stablecoin UST, which plunged the crypto industry into a deep winter.  5:14 UTC: Adds comments from Terraform Labs' spokesperson",NEGATIVE,LUNA,LUNA | REGULATION | TRADING,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/28/terraform-labs-luna-and-mir-tokens-are-securities-judge-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70f74bd5d22dc3d93a5dd0d7c785d853e02d0f85-7952x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21854917,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567289,1703804448,"CryptoQuant Sound Alarm: Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval May Trigger Drop To $32,000, Here’s Why","A recent report from CryptoQuant has sparked discussions, suggesting that a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could lead to a significant market event. This possibility arises amid the Bitcoin (BTC) price stabilizing above $40,000, leaving many market participants sitting on substantial unrealized profits. The report by CryptoQuant particularly posits that this scenario could trigger a “sell the news” event, historically linked to market corrections. Related Reading: Eyes On $50,000: Bitcoin Poised For Major Rally Amid Spot ETF Optimism – Analyst Bitcoin Possible Drop To $32,000 CryptoQuant’s analysis points to the current state of Bitcoin holders as a reason for the possible drop in BTC price when the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF happens. Particularly the short-term ones, experiencing unrealized profit margins of around 30%. According to CryptoQuant, such high-profit levels have often preceded price drops. Additionally, the report notes an uptick in selling activity from Bitcoin miners, adding to the potential sell pressure on BTC. This, combined with the market’s anticipation of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, could create a volatile environment, as highlighted by CryptoQuant. Based on CryptoQuant’s analysis, during downturns within bullish markets, Bitcoin’s value often falls back to the level where short-term investors have historically realized their prices. Considering this, the report suggests that in a scenario where “sell the news” occurs, Bitcoin’s value might see a downturn, with a possible dip to around “$32,000.” Contrasting Views And Support Levels Amid ETF Speculations The conversation around a Bitcoin spot ETF’s potential approval is not one-sided. Several analysts predict a positive outcome, with firms like Matrixport and prominent analysts like Michael van de Poppe suggesting that the approval could catapult Bitcoin’s price to new highs. Related Reading: Matrixport Foresees Bitcoin Hitting $50,000 Price Mark: Here’s When Matrixport anticipates that the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the US SEC could drive BTC’s value to around $50,000 in early 2024. Van de Poppe echoes this sentiment, foreseeing a potential rise to the $47,000-$50,000 range. #Bitcoin did test the lows, didn’t take the liquidity beneath the lows. Anyway, correction seems over and pre-ETF we’re likely to test $47-50K. Buy the dips. pic.twitter.com/Ar4mqvYRjJ — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 19, 2023 Additionally, while CryptoQuant predicts a possible drop to $32,000, other analysts’ prediction of BTC bottom doesn’t go that low. Analyst Ali, for instance, has highlighted a robust support zone between $37,150 and $38,360. In case of a deeper correction, #Bitcoin finds solid support between $37,150 and $38,360. This zone is backed by 1.52 million addresses holding 534,000 $BTC. Also, watch out for two resistance walls that could keep the #BTC uptrend at bay: one at $43,850 and another at $46,400. pic.twitter.com/NGm1XpMOLf — Ali (@ali_charts) December 11, 2023 This range is reinforced by the activities of approximately 1.52 million addresses holding about 534,000 BTC. Notably, such a strong foundation of support might mitigate the risks of a drastic price fall even if a “sell the news” event were to occur following the spot ETF approval.

According to a Bloomberg report, the ETF sold all its remaining 2.25 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) while acquiring 4.32 million shares of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. Caution As Reason For Exiting Grayscale Bitcoin Trust According to Bloomberg, Wood cited caution as the reason behind the sale of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The move was prompted by concerns that the anticipated conversion of the trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF might not receive approval from US regulators in early January. Additionally, Wood highlighted the substantial reduction in the trust’s discount to its net asset value, which, combined with its price increase, influenced the decision. Wood emphasized the unpredictability surrounding which Bitcoin-related offerings would gain regulatory approval, expressing optimism about Bitcoin while acknowledging the uncertainty ahead. Related Reading: Axie Infinity Springs Back To Life With Surprise 35% Rally – Details In this regard, Bloomberg ETF expert Erich Balchunas highlights that approximately $100 million of the proceeds were used to purchase the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), likely as a liquid transition vehicle to maintain exposure to Bitcoin while gradually transitioning into either ARKW or ARKB. Interestingly, ARK has now become the second-largest holder of BITO, although Balchunas clarifies that this is a temporary parking spot. Blachunas emphasizes that institutions, including ARK, often employ highly liquid ETFs for transitions of this nature. Balchunas also points out that this move aligns with the prediction made by Bloomberg a month ago, reflecting strategic foresight on ARK’s part. According to Balchunas, this decision is smart as it allows ARK to boost its own ETF’s assets under management (AUM) while saving investors from incurring a significant expense ratio in the process. Wood’s Long-Term Vision Per the report, the reduction in holdings of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has been a gradual process for Cathie Wood, even as the price of Bitcoin surged to its highest level since April 2022. Throughout 2023, Bitcoin more than doubled in value, with significant gains occurring towards the end of the year amid speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve spot Bitcoin ETFs in the first days of January 2024. During the Sohn Australia conference last month, Wood touted the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust as her top pick. However, recent developments have led to a shift in the ETF’s portfolio composition. In addition to the changes involving Grayscale and ProShares, the ARK ETF also purchased 20,000 shares of the ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Futures Strategy ETF and sold 148,885 shares of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global, according to the fund’s report.

21851186,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567246,1703793634,Bitcoin Whales Bought The Recent Dip While Market Panicked,"On-chain data suggests the Bitcoin whales may have participated in a significant amount of buying while the market was panicking about the recent lows. Bitcoin Exchange Netflow Has Been Quite Negative Recently An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post pointed out that the exchanges have recently seen outflows. The indicator of interest here is the “exchange netflow,” which keeps track of the net amount of Bitcoin entering or exiting out of the wallets of all centralized exchanges. The metric’s value is calculated by subtracting the outflows from the inflows. When the indicator has a positive value, the inflows overwhelm the outflows, and a net number of coins moves into these platforms. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Bull Run Begin? This Could Be The Metric To Watch As one of the main reasons investors may want to deposit their BTC to the exchanges is for selling purposes, this trend can have bearish implications for the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, the negative metric implies withdrawals are taking place, which can be a sign that the holders are accumulating right now. Such a trend could naturally turn out to be bullish for the asset’s price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange netflow over the past year: The value of the metric has been quite negative in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant The above graph shows that the Bitcoin exchange netflow has observed some deep negative spikes recently. This suggests that some large outflows have been occurring from these platforms. Interestingly, these withdrawals came as BTC slipped towards the $41,600 level, implying that some investors were potentially buying while the rest of the market was panicking about the drawdown. Given the large scale of the deposits, it’s likely that whale entities were behind them. The fact that these humongous holders were willing to risk accumulating at these recent prices could be a positive sign for the continuation of the rally. Microstrategy has also just announced its massive $615 million BTC acquisition, which can naturally be another optimistic sign for the coin. The exchange netflows occurring ahead of the announcement are interesting, though. It’s hard to be sure if there is any connection between the two, but one possibility is that the whales who bought at these recent lows knew about the acquisitions ahead of time. Related Reading: Polygon Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle, Analyst Puts This Target Another, and perhaps the more likely explanation, is that these large investors were looking for an entry point into the asset ahead of the potential ETF approvals, and the dip presented as good an opportunity as any to achieve so. Whatever the case, it would seem like the moves made by the whales might have paid off so far, as the Bitcoin price has rebounded since its lows (although its recovery hasn’t been too strong yet).

In the coming week, we’ll be unpacking 2023, its downs and ups, to reveal what the next months could bring for crypto and DeFi investors. Related Reading: A Crypto Christmas Special With Jlabs Digital: Past, Present, And Future Like last year, we paid homage to Charles Dicke’s classic “A Christmas Carol” and gathered a group of experts to discuss the crypto market’s past, present, and future. In that way, our readers might discover clues that will allow them to transverse 2024 and its potential trends. Crypto Christmas With STORM: Bitcoin ETF Should Be Out Of Your Wishlist? For today’s issue, our team got to chat with Sheraz Ahmed, Managing Partner at blockchain solutions provider STORM and founder of Decentral House. Ahmed has been present at some of the most important crypto events in 2023 and is constantly speaking with founders, organizations, and relevant actors within and outside the nascent sector. Thus, Ahmed has a unique perspective on the industry, its blindspots, and possible catalyzers. During the interview, we talked about the downside of approving a Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States and why the space might be unprepared for a new bull cycle. This is what he told us. Q: Our team has coincided with you in several crypto events this year; where do you think most of these events coincide? And what do you believe has been overlooked during 2023, a narrative, a project, something people missed as the industry enters another cycle? Switzerland, Europe, Dubai, Singapore, and Rio (de Janeiro). I do believe that we are too early for the next cycle. The broken models of the last bull run are yet to be rebuilt. Infrastructure has improved, custody, wallets, exchanges, and stablecoins, but the business models for Dapps (Decentralized Applications) have not evolved. I fear that we enter into another vaporware cycle and, at best have to wait 4 more years for real use cases/adoption or risk burning ourselves completely with shitcoins and scams. Q: As Crypto enters a new cycle, what’s different about the industry when you compare it to early 2021 and 2017? Where can investors see the growth? Is it in the players joining the industry, the financial products, or in its community? There is a bit more maturity, although that sometimes just feels like the veterans are just numb to the pain this industry can self-inflict. We do see genuine interest from large institutional players in the financial, consumer, and impact fields. But can we convert those ideas into adoption? Investment in utility and payment tokens is an oxymoron. They are not meant to be investment products and are not regulated as such. An investor could look into an infrastructure play, although I believe that is quite saturated today at approx. $700M. My bet would be early-stage protocol ecosystem funds (equity-based), with a portion of that taken in tokens for the utility of governance, etc., that might be attached. Q: The upcoming approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US seems like the perfect indicator that crypto has made it to the mainstream, but what’s the next frontier? Where does the industry go from here? I don’t agree. For me, it just sounds like the bankers finally believe they can make money off our industry. Now, does that mean it’ll be good for prices in the short term and more eyeballs? Yes. But be careful what you wish for, as when the heavy artillery comes in, they crush everything/everyone in their path.

According to JD, this set of traders may overlook the opportunity to get on before the next price surge, drawing parallels to past XRP price action. Analyst JD Draws Parallels To Past XRP Trends Despite the volatile nature of the crypto market, most cryptocurrencies are known to repeat or mirror past phenomena in their price action. As a result, it is very common for crypto analysts to look at the past and assess current trends when trying to predict the future movement of cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whale Moves 71 Million DOGE To Robinhood, What Does This Mean For Price? The expert compared the present price pattern to 2017, which was the year that XRP finally broke its boring price action that lasted from 2013 to 2017. A look through this cycle shows XRP underperforming when compared to other cryptocurrencies. As a result, the ‘dumb money’ traders complained and bolted, causing them to miss the astounding gain that came after. However, XRP would then go on a 600x price gain after breaking out of the 4-year consolidation trendline. As a result, the crypto reached as high as $3.84 in January 2018, its current all-time high. XRP has had its ups and downs this year stemming from different updates within the Ripple ecosystem. The crypto went on a price surge in the middle of the year, reaching a yearly high of $0.82 in July. XRP has traded below this price point since then, despite most cryptocurrencies registering new yearly highs in the last quarter of the year. JD noted that XRP’s price action is currently mimicking the point at which it broke out of the consolidation in 2017, warning of ‘dumb money’ traders who might miss out on the next potential price surge. #XRP – I remember 2017 when “Dumb money” capitulated after 4years of “boring emotional” action while other coins 🚀📈 “Dumb money” complained & capitulated missing the 600x gain LOL! Present pattern looks exactly like 2017. Need more dumb money to complain before 🚀📈 LOL! $XRP… pic.twitter.com/tbyckfYA8V — JD 🇵🇭 (@jaydee_757) December 26, 2023 Token price sitting at $0.64 Source: XRPUSD On Tradingview.com XRP Price Target XRP has grown massively since its 2017 days and now has a market cap of over $34 billion. When asked about a potential price target, JD noted that the repeat of a 600x in the case of a breakout would be unrealistic at this point. An 8-10x surge is more likely according to the current technicals. With XRP currently trading at $0.639, a 10x price surge would make a price target just over $6. Related Reading: Crypto Trading Firm Expects Bitcoin To Crash To $36,000, Here’s Why In another chart shared by the analyst, he noted that XRP’s price is currently forming a cup and handle formation in the 2-day timeframe.

With the latest decline, SOL extended its pullback to over 20% from $125 on Monday, its highest price since April 2022, CoinDesk data shows. At press time, SOL pared some of its losses and was changing hands at slightly above $100.  Over the past three days, some $32 million worth of leveraged long positions – bets on higher prices – got liquidated as trading platforms forcibly closed trades due to insufficient margin, accelerating the pullback, CoinGlass data shows.  Solana-based meme tokens such as BONK and WIF, which saw meteoric rises earlier this month, are down over 50% from their all-time highs recorded in December, pointing to profit taking and cooling interest in participating in the frenzy.  Amid SOL's pullback, the BNB Smart Chain's native token [BNB] rallied 9% in the past 24 hours and took back the fourth spot in the cryptocurrency ranking by market capitalization from solana.  Why Solana's SOL is down  Solana is one of the best-performing crypto assets of 2023 rallying 900% from around $10 in early January, rejuvenating its ecosystem after being one of the most beaten-down assets during the bear market.

Whale Is Moving Tokens As Key PancakeSwap Voting Event Proceeds According to a report from Scopescan, a blockchain analytics platform, a whale has moved approximately 1.7 million CAKE worth $1.3 million in the past week from Binance, Gate.io, and Bitget to a series of crypto addresses. The timing of this transfer is noteworthy since it coincides with key voting that would permanently shape PancakeSwap’s tokenomics. The proposed token burn is gathering significant support, with over 90% of CAKE holders in agreement. According to the proposer, reducing the total supply to 450 million CAKE is reasonable. It would also ensure sufficient supply for future growth while achieving “ultrasound CAKE.” Herein, the idea is to make CAKE deflationary over the long term, and this may support prices as PancakeSwap continues to play a vital role in token swapping in the broader BNB Chain ecosystem. Related Reading: Axie Infinity Springs Back To Life With Surprise 35% Rally – Details According to DeFiLlama data, PancakeSwap is the largest DEX in the BNB Chain ecosystem, with a total value locked (TVL) of $1.6 billion, commanding roughly half of the network’s TVL of around $3.5 billion. Notably, PancakeSwap has been resilient and continues to evolve, shaking off competition even after the deployment of Uniswap v3 on the BNB Chain. In the past 24 hours, PancakeSwap has generated over $815,000 in fees, more than 7.5X that of Venus, a lending protocol, the second largest in the BNB Chain ecosystem. Is CAKE Ready For $10? Notably, the token burn proposal also comes when PancakeSwap is undergoing significant changes, including the recent introduction of veCAKE and Voting gauges, whose voting concluded on November 22. With this proposal passing with over 99% community support, veCAKE holders can now vote on where future CAKE farm emissions will be directed. This gives CAKE holders greater governance influence. Supporters maintain that this crucial decision makes the DEX more decentralized and community-facing.

Thank you to all the contributors who have shared their knowledge and guidance for advisors this year.  We end the year with Kunal Bhasin, co-leader of KPMG Canada’s crypto asset and blockchain practice, debunking many of the bitcoin myths.  I wish everyone a happy new year. All signs are pointing to an exciting 2024 in the crypto space.  Happy reading.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Debunking Bitcoin Myths - A Guide for Financial Advisors  As we embarked on 2023, the crypto world was still grappling with the fallout from the FTX debacle and Terra LUNA's collapse in 2022. These events catalyzed a contagion in the industry, leading to a significant loss of trust, liquidity issues and market instability. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin price demonstrated remarkable resilience up ~150% YTD by the final week of 2023 per CoinDesk charts - Bitcoin YTD growth as of Dec 26, 2023. This growth underscores the robustness and potential of digital assets, even in the face of adversity.  However, despite this growth and resilience, several myths continue to plague the digital asset ecosystem. These misconceptions are often fueled by a lack of understanding, biased perceptions, and persistent stereotypes. As we see increased interest from investors and the looming possibility of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., it's imperative for financial advisors to provide educated and unbiased responses to these myths. While I cannot cover all the myths in this article, I will address the most prominent one for bitcoin i.e. bitcoin is mainly used for illegal activities and money laundering.  In bitcoin's early days, a small but visionary group of individuals and organizations recognized its potential and the revolutionary technology underpinning it. As bitcoin gained broader adoption and its value increased, it inevitably caught the attention of criminals, leading to its use in illicit activities, including the infamous darknet marketplace Silk Road, which accounted for nearly 20% of total bitcoin economic activity at its peak in 2013. Additionally, bitcoin became the preferred currency for ransomware attacks. These developments contributed to bitcoin's reputation as a ""criminal currency,"" a perception that still persists to this day.  At a high level, combating financial crime and money laundering relies on three key pillars - technology infrastructure, regulation and law enforcement. Bad actors are always looking for new ways when one or more of these pillars is missing or not evolved yet.  Acknowledging the above, it is important to note that bitcoin’s early adoption among illicit users was not due to its alleged untraceable and anonymous nature of bitcoin technology but rather the lack of sophisticated crypto intelligence and analysis infrastructure, as well as lack of applicable regulations at the time. Contrary to popular belief, bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous.  With fiat currency, three pillars have evolved over decades with the broad adoption of the internet and continue to evolve to this day with enhanced compliance requirements to capture the evolving threats landscape. However, having these three pillars in place doesn’t guarantee the prevention and detection of all illicit activities. In fact, according to a 2022 report by the U.S. Department of Treasury, key weaknesses within the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CTF) regulatory regime include a lack of timely access to beneficial ownership information of legal entities and lack of transparency in non-financed real estate transactions, and use of virtual assets for money laundering remains far below that of fiat currency and more traditional methods. Expecting an emerging technology and users to have all pillars figured out from inception isn’t reasonable. Now let’s break these pillars down for bitcoin as it stands today:  Technology Infrastructure  Since 2014, there has been a significant effort to develop and implement infrastructure to prevent, detect and investigate bitcoin and other crypto transactions. Today, there are numerous tools available for financial institutions, regulators, law enforcement and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) that enable advanced techniques and tools to track and analyze bitcoin and crypto transactions, leading to the identification and apprehension of criminals in various cases. The level of traceability in bitcoin is actually higher than in many other financial systems, especially cash where transactions can be much more opaque.  While there are improvements underway to enable advanced techniques for crypto activities outside of bitcoin, such as privacy coins, stablecoins and DeFi, these are already quite mature for transaction monitoring and reporting crypto institutions.  Regulations  The view that bitcoin and other crypto assets are unregulated is a major misconception. It’s a known fact that regulations follow innovation, as regulators need to undergo a comprehensive administrative process to understand the impact and regulate accordingly. In fact, the U.S. was one of the first countries to subject crypto exchanges to registration, reporting and recordkeeping requirements for AML/CTF purposes when FinCEN classified these as Money Services Businesses (MSB) in 2013. Many other countries, including Japan and South Korea, followed suit during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom in 2017/ 2018. In 2019, Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issued comprehensive guidance that outlines the need for countries and VASPs, and other entities involved in crypto asset activities, to understand the AML/CTF risks associated with their activities and take appropriate mitigating measures to address them. These have been periodically updated since then.  As of today, 83% of G20 nations and major financial centers have enacted or are developing national crypto laws. An important distinction to note in the bitcoin world is that while there's a reactive component to regulation, there's also a significant proactive effort to understand and regulate this rapidly evolving technology.  Law Enforcement  Between 2013 and 2023, approximately $8.496 billion in crypto and fiat have been seized as a result of law enforcement actions, as well as numerous bad actors that enabled have been charged per the Chainalysis Myth-Busting Report (2023). We’ve also seen a number of enforcement actions globally for non-compliance of AML/CTF regulations – most recently with the Binance settlement worth over $4 billion. Global collaboration across law enforcement agencies and public-private partnerships is enabling identification and investigation of financial crime in a much more efficient way given the underlying technology and unique characteristics of bitcoin.  Overall, the key takeaway is that with every technological advancement, there's a period of adaptation where benefits are harnessed, and risks are mitigated through new regulations, enhanced technology infrastructure and law enforcement actions. In the case of bitcoin, it’s happening at an unprecedented pace and the illicit actors are realizing that bitcoin is not a good instrument for money laundering given the current stature of the three pillars discussed above.  – Kunal Bhasin, Partner & Co-Leader, Cryptoassets & Blockchain CoE, KPMG  Ask an Expert  Q. What tax related items should investors be cognizant of?  Investors should pay attention to whether or not they have realized or unrealized gains or losses in their crypto trading accounts. Each carries unique implications that could greatly impact the next tax year.  Realized gains - If you have realized gains from selling digital assets this year make sure you segregate enough money to pay your capital gains taxes next April. Tax brackets will vary depending on the individual. Be careful when reinvesting proceeds from trades that made you a lot of money. You will owe taxes and if your new investments lose a lot of their principal you won’t be able to cover your future tax bill.  Unrealized gains - Keep in mind that crypto is volatile, and with the end of the calendar year so close it may be beneficial for you to hold off selling your winners until 2024 depending on your situation. That is because any gains made in 2023 have cap gains taxes due in April 2024. If you wait just one week and sell, the taxes won’t need to be paid until April 2025. That means you are free to reinvest and earn a return for an additional year. The opportunity to compound interest in this space could be extremely beneficial if you wait until the new year.  Realized losses - Realized crypto losses can be offset against other capital gains. Keep in mind that your losses can be carried forward indefinitely for future years and while the losses primarily offset capital gains they can be used to offset ordinary income from your work (up to $3000 per year)  Unrealized losses - Unrealized losses are currently a unique benefit to crypto investors. For stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds investors are bound to what is known as the wash-sale rule. This means that if you sell one of these securities at a loss you must wait 30 days before you can repurchase it. This rule does not apply to cryptocurrencies yet. If you have a digital asset with an unrealized loss, it is an option to sell and rebuy immediately. Having that capital loss to carry forward (called tax loss harvesting) can be extremely beneficial even if you can’t offset it against a gain this year. Note that with exchange fees, slippage, and general market volatility you won’t guarantee you’ll have the same number of units when you re-buy. Until this rule is applied to cryptocurrency it is a benefit that only direct holders will have. Spot bitcoin ETF holders will be bound to wash-sale rules as they will hold a security, not a digital asset.  – Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM  Keep Reading  Bitcoin is among the top 15global currencies.  2024 bitcoin price predictions are coming in and they are all over the map.

The notices were issued by India's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) which falls under the nation's Finance Ministry.  Binance, KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global and Bitfinex are the nine exchanges. The government has also taken the first steps to block the URLs of ""said entities that are operating illegally without complying with the provisions of the PMLA in India.""  The government didn't provide a specific timeframe or the consequences of not adhering to the notice as there are no crypto-specific precedents for such action in the country.  The action appeared imminent after the government's written declaration from earlier this month that as many as 28 domestic crypto service providers registered themselves with the FIU. That number has already gone up to 31.  In March, India’s Finance Ministry mandated that crypto businesses will have to register with the FIU, the country's anti-money laundering unit, and comply with other processes under the PMLA. This meant crypto businesses became legally obligated to perform verification processes such as Know Your Customer (KYC).  ""The obligation is activity-based and is not contingent on physical presence in India,"" the FIU said. ""However, several offshore entities though catering to a substantial part of Indian users were not getting registered and coming under the Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) framework.""

In what is being described as a potential ""sell the news"" event, CryptoQuant said in a note to CoinDesk that trader's unrealized profits are currently lingering at a level that historically precedes a correction.  ""Sell the news"" is a well-known term in capital markets, it describes how asset prices, leverage and sentiment run up in the lead up to a bullish event only for prices to tumble shortly after.  This is because astute traders capitalize on the over-crowded long trade, trapping those with leverage and forcing them to close or get liquidated as price goes against them.  An ETF being approved is perceived as a bullish event as it will open up inflows to bitcoin from institutions, thus creating consistent buy pressure.  ""Short term Bitcoin holders are experiencing high unrealized profit margins of 30%, which historically has preceded price corrections (red circles),"" CryptoQuant wrote in the note. ""Moreover, short term holders are still spending Bitcoin at a profit, while rallies usually come after short-term losses are realized.""  CryptoQuant added that bitcoin price may decline to as low as $32,000, which is the the short-term holder realized price.  Capriole Investments said that ""conservative portfolio management"" makes sense in the lead up to the potential approval of a spot ETF.  ""With Bitcoin up over 60% since ETF mania began a few months ago, and with every man and his dog on X.com expecting an approval on or around 10 January, we must start to anticipate much larger volatility events (up/down) in this region. Risk today is substantially higher for long Bitcoin positions than it was just a few weeks ago,"" Capriole wrote in a blog post.  In bitcoin's history, ""sell the news"" events are common, in 2017 BTC topped out at $20,000 after the CME listed BTC futures, and in 2021 the world's largest cryptocurrency peaked again, hitting $65,000 after Coinbase completed its IPO before losing ground in the following months.

Cardano (ADA) Poised For Bullish Or Bearish Trajectory The crypto analyst recently shared his predictions for Cardano (ADA) with the crypto community during one of his YouTube videos. In the YouTube video – “CARDANO ADA – MOMENT OF TRUTH!,” LuckSide asserted that ADA is at a critical crossroads. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano (ADA) Price Will Rise 1700% To $11, Gives Reasons Why The analyst revealed a technical projection that indicates ADA is about to undergo a major price shift. According to him, this is either a bullish or a bearish trajectory in the near future. LuckSide finds signals that are pointing in the direction of a significant price shift, after analyzing ADA’s price charts. This analysis is centered on the significant price gap in the Cardano native token. LuckSide asserted that the gap is “where the highest concentration of liquidity is located for ADA.” This is marked by ongoing selling pressure at the resistance level between “$0.60 and $0.67,” in sharp contrast to a $0.40 level. This gap denotes an unexplored area and suggests a potential strong move, given ADA’s price history. He noted that Cardano could either rise to test the resistance level around $0.70 or drop to the $0.40 support level. The crypto expert also pointed out signs of robustness and strength of ADA in his video. The stability of pivotal support levels and moving averages underscores the strength of the crypto asset. The larger market indicators, such as the volatility and price stability of Bitcoin (BTC), further support this resiliency. The analyst also attributed the market’s movement to the impending Bitcoin Halving event in Mid-2024, due to its market impact. However, LuckSide notes that unforeseen circumstances have the potential to change ADA’s direction while conceding the unpredictability of the market. He further added that although, a decline to $0.40 “might create opportunities to buy the token at a lesser price.” The Network’s Growth Is Similar To Bitcoin Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano recently underscored the network’s growth, acknowledging that it mimics the natural growth of Bitcoin. The founder took to X (formerly Twitter) to celebrate the network’s performance with the community. Related Reading: Insights On ADA’s Security Concerns: Cardano Founder And Ripple CTO Exchange Views In the X post, Hoskinson stated that he has been observing with “glee as some people worry about Cardano’s blocks filling up.” He further reminded the community about the criticism of the network being a useless “ghost chain,” with no liquidity. Hoskinson has assured the community that “Cardano is designed to handle these loads.” He noted a “huge design space” that optimizes the network and DApps for greater scalability in the short and long term. In addition, he has highlighted the network’s victories without Venture Capital (VCs), the media, or influencers.

The discussion centered around XRP, with Egrag and the banker analyzing how the altcoin could be worth $2,500 in the near future. XRP Price To $2,500 Is A Possibility Talks about XRP hitting $2,500 arose when the banker challenged Egrag to explain how 40,000 XRP could end up equalling $100 million. The banker was aware of Egrag’s knowledge of technical analysis and, from the story, seemed to have posed the question to see if Egrag believed XRP could attain such heights of $2,500. Related Reading: Crypto Trading Firm Expects Bitcoin To Crash To $36,000, Here’s Why The crypto analyst took up the challenge and explained to the banker, using a chart that he shared in his post, how XRP will hit $2,500. Egrag did justice with his explanation as the banker had nodded in agreement. The banker also went on to pinpoint how the financial cycles were aligned for the token to achieve this price action. From the chart, the XRP price hitting this price level could happen by 2029. That is why the banker sees the altcoin as a long-term investment, as he says that holding the altcoin till then could yield incredible rewards. The crypto analyst provided insights into this banker’s wealth of experience as he is said to boast connections across all spheres in the banking and finance sector. The banker had also alluded to how Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, had raised the prospect of 40,000 ETH being equal to $100 million. Then, it might have sounded implausible to many, but it has somehow materialized. He sees the same thing happening with XRP, just that this time, it could take longer, considering that ETH hit $2,500 in a shorter period. Token price still showing strength Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Holders Need To Be More Patient Egrag has continued to reiterate that patience is key if XRP holders want to enjoy huge returns on their holdings. Going by this recent prediction, the XRP price could make a 390,000% gain for investors by 2029. However, it will require a lot of belief and perseverance if these holders hope to partake in such a mammoth gain. Related Reading: Solana Meme Coins: A Guide to Buying, Trading, And Profiting From SOL Investments In the meantime, the analyst is encouraging the community to accumulate as much XRP as they can. He stated that the banker told him that the crypto token could be the “ultimate savior” for liquidity when the tides slow down. This is a possibility, especially considering that a crypto founder had recently asserted that the crypto will surpass Bitcoin. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.64, up by over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The recent purchase pushes the company's holdings to 189,150 BTC worth around $5.9 billion, which was bought at an average price of $31,168 per BTC. MicroStrategy began purchasing bitcoin in August 2020. The company's most recent purchase before Wednesday's took place last month, when it acquired 16,130 BTC worth around $608 million at the time.  ARK Invest bought 4.3 million shares of ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) yesterday after dumping its remaining holdings of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The ProShares stake is valued at $9.2 million based on closing prices. Cathie Wood's investment vehicle also sold $27.6 million worth of Coinbase (COIN) stock and bought 20,000 shares of the Ark 21Shares Active Bitcoin Future Strategy ETF, according to an emailed transaction notice. The ProShares exchange-traded fund, which started trading in October 2021 as the first U.S. bitcoin-linked ETF, now accounts for 5.03% of the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), its sixth-largest holding.

Green portion of the bar represents bullish mentions on social media while red stands for bearish, with yellow indicating neutral bias.  The sentiment is biased bullish for most tokens, with the retail crowd more focused on ether and smaller alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) compared to bitcoin.

This rally catapults AXS to the forefront of gaming cryptocurrencies, boasting a market capitalization of $1.4 billion and a circulating supply of 132 million coins. The driving force behind this impressive upswing can be traced to a recent major game update, which introduces a transformative element to the Axie Infinity ecosystem. Related Reading: $2 In Sight? Mina Protocol’s 47% Growth Raises Price Target Hopes Axie Infinity’s Evolution Transforms Game Economy This update focuses on the evolution of Axies, creatures analogous to Pokemons, offering players the opportunity to enhance their digital companions with additional features and abilities. Beyond the surface modifications, this evolution introduces a deflationary mechanism that radically modifies the Axie Infinity economy. This system can lower the total number of Axies, which would raise the value of already-existing Axies and strengthen ties between players and their virtual counterparts. However, amidst this surge, a note of caution emerges. The market’s rebound and Bitcoin’s push towards $45,000 have fueled momentum in AXS’s price, but concerns loom over a potential sharp correction. Impatient holders, grappling with losses, are becoming a focal point of concern. The surge prompted a significant number of sellers to liquidate their positions, with data from Coinglass indicating approximately $2.4 million in short positions liquidated, defying bearish predictions. As the market adjusts, the data reveals a potential for a significant correction. The number of profitable addresses has increased to nearly 30%, yet it is eclipsed by the 51,000 holders currently in the red. AXSUSD currently trading at $9.31250000 on the daily chart: TradingView.com This scenario suggests that the ongoing upward trend in AXS price might entice loss-incurring holders to exit the market in an effort to minimize their losses. AXS Technical Analysis: Key Levels And Caution In terms of technical analysis, AXS has established key resistance levels at $10.41, $11.37, and $12.01, with immediate support at $9.09 and additional support at $8.54 and $8.06. 🚀 #AxieInfinity (AXS) showcases dynamic market movement! 📈 Trading near $9.73 with key resistances ahead.

42418941,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD7U5,1703763013,A Record $11B Crypto Options Expiry Looms as BTC Shows Little Volatility,"Bitcoin, ether options worth over $11 billion will expire on Deribit on Friday.  Both cryptocurrencies are trading well above their ""max pain points.""  The market is unlikely to see major volatility ahead of the expiry, one observer said.  Bitcoin [BTC] remains well supported, holding above $40,000 as the clock ticks down to 2023's last quarterly options expiry.  On Friday at 08:00 UTC, a staggering $7.7 billion worth of options tied to bitcoin [BTC] and $3.5 billion of options linked to ether [ETH] will expire on the crypto exchange Deribit.  ""The total of over $11 billion marks Deribit's largest expiry thus far, of which almost $5 billion will expire in the money, the largest amount ever as well, potentially resulting in above average hedging and trading activity,"" Luuk Strijers, the exchange's chief commercial officer, told CoinDesk.  Options are derivative contracts offering the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined ""strike"" price at a later date, the expiry date. A call offers the right to buy; a put confers the right to sell. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC or one ETH. An in-the-money call option is one with a strike price lower than the market rate. For a put, an in-the money strike price is higher than the going rate.  This quarter's 60% upswing in the bitcoin price and ether's 43% gain have investors scrambling to add upside exposure through calls. That explains the record notional open interest for in-the-money call options.  According to Strijers, clients have been rolling their positions from the December expiry to contracts expiring in January and subsequent months, and the process could continue into Friday's quarterly settlement.  ""Beyond hedging, we also see clients rolling positions to 2024 expiries and expect to see more of that closer to the expiry as well as afterward,"" Strijers said. ""After the expiration, all eyes and trading activity will be focused on the upcoming ETF decision.""  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is said to have set Jan. 10 as the deadline for approving or rejecting an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests directly in bitcoin, a so-called spot ETF, rather than one investing in futures tied to BTC. Many industry participants expect it to give the green light to a spot fund, paving the way for continued upside price volatility in the historically bullish reward halving year.  The chart shows notional open interest for the BTC call and put options at various strikes expiring on Friday.  It also shows bitcoin's max pain point (MPP), or the level at which options buyers stand to lose the most on expiry. The theory is that options sellers, typically institutions with ample capital supply, look to push the underlying asset's spot price toward that level to make their counterparties, the buyers, suffer the most. In late 2020 and most of 2021, bitcoin saw volatility in the direction of the max pain point in the lead-up to the expiry, only to resuming the uptrend following the settlement.  Still, market analyst Chang expects prices to remain steady before Friday's expiry.  ""BTC MPP is $33,000 and ETH MPP is $1,900, very far from current prices. MPP can provide important points from time to time, but for now, we expect BTC and ETH to move to MPP very little. There is no need to worry much about MPP at the moment. If something like that were to happen, it would only be possible if there was a disaster on Earth,"" Chang told CoinDesk.  ""I plan to keep a close eye on any new options trading tapes after the big options expirations. I also think the market is heading towards the final spark and I expect the last real move to be very soon,"" Chang said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/28/a-record-11b-crypto-options-expiry-looms-as-btc-shows-little-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9323ae5715dfe0158e88c84ef441a7a97edcc2f7-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418935,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD7Ov,1703758707,Blast Hits $1.1B in Deposits More Than a Month Before It's Due to Go Live,"Blast, the recently announced layer 2 blockchain set up by the developers of non-fungible token (NFT) platform Blur, has surpassed $1.1 billion in deposits, attracted by an airdrop promised for May even though the platform is not due to go live until February.  Speculators, unperturbed by the controversial one-way bridge to Blast, have deposited $1 billion worth of staked ether (stETH) and $103 million worth of the dai (DAI) stablecoin since the website went live last month, according to DefiLlama.  In return, depositors receive a yield of around 5% on their staked assets as well as ""Blast Points,"" which can be redeemed for an airdrop that will be distributed in May.  Users can also accrue points by referring others to the platform. Blur ran a similar airdrop after setting up an NFT marketplace in February. The BLUR token now has a market cap of $500 million, having risen by 23% over the past month.  The idea of allowing deposits to a platform that is not yet live has attracted criticism from sections of the crypto industry, with some suggesting that the project has the hallmarks of a pyramid scheme where early depositors and affiliate marketers will receive a lion's share of the eventual airdrop.  Some of that criticism even came from Blast's backers, venture capitalist firm Paradigm. Paradigm Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson said Blast's marketing campaign ""crossed lines"" and that Paradigm doesn't agree with rolling out deposits before the blockchain or withdrawals are live. Robinson did, however, say that he is excited about several components of Blur.  It's worth noting that crypto asset prices have surged across this board this year. Bitcoin [BTC] has risen more than 150% to around $43,000 while ether [ETH] has doubled to $2,400. The increase has spurred a wave of optimism across investors, which is highlighted by the rapid rise of projects like Blast.",NEUTRAL,BTC | BLUR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | BLUR | AIRDROP,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/28/blast-hits-11b-in-deposits-more-than-a-month-before-its-due-to-go-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc69450c4a8212500c19faee8ac82a6a96acdc96-2332x980.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418931,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD7Kn,1703756552,Indonesian Crypto Exchanges Must Register With New Bourse or Face Shutdown,"Indonesia’s government expects all crypto exchanges operating in the country to register with the recently launched national bourse for digital assets.  The government expects the bourse to help monitor asset liquidity and record crypto transactions for tax purposes.  The country has around six million more registered crypto traders than stock traders, according to official 2023 data.  Indonesia launched the world's first national bourse for crypto assets this year. Now, the country wants all crypto exchanges to register with the platform to continue operating.  The bourse – called the Commodity Future Exchange (CFX) – is designed to operate similarly to traditional stock exchanges like NASDAQ but with a specific focus on digital assets.  The CFX is the Indonesian government’s response to the high local demand for crypto. In Indonesia, there are more than 18 million registered crypto traders compared to around 12 million stock traders, according to official data from 2023.  While the stated goal of the bourse is to make the crypto ecosystem safer for investors, government plans show the exchange is also expected to help track digital asset transactions for tax purposes.  Getting authorized  Regulations introduced in 2019 by the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (Bappebti) require all crypto exchanges operating in the country to seek authorization.  All ‘legal’ crypto exchanges operating in Indonesia since 2014 are lumped into one category called “prospective crypto exchanges” because the authorization regime came later. Firms have to go through stringent checks to win recognition as legitimate enterprises linked to the CFX.  The authorization process involves registration with self-regulatory organizations (SRO) like the CFX and later a test by Bappebti to determine a company’s fitness to operate.  A crypto exchange license (PFAK) is only issued if all requirements are met, Robby Bun, chairman of the country’s crypto asset trade association, Aspakrindo, told CoinDesk Indonesia. Aspakrindo acts as a mediator between prospective crypto exchanges in the industry and regulators.  Read more: Indonesia Has Global Plans for Local Crypto Tokens  Without completing the new procedures and registrations, prospective crypto exchanges cannot operate in Indonesia.  ""There is a deadline for prospective crypto exchanges. If they do not register by the specified time, they will automatically [be unable to] operate in Indonesia,” Robby said, adding that the deadline is Aug. 17, 2024. If they want to continue operating, crypto exchanges must also obtain licenses, Robby said.  In Indonesia, there are 29 prospective crypto exchanges that will require authorization, Subani, chairman of CFX, said in an interview with CoinDesk Indonesia.  “All transactions within these prospective crypto exchanges are diligently reported and monitored. Our primary objective is to ensure a smooth transition from being a prospective crypto exchange to becoming a fully recognized crypto exchange,"" Subani said.  Taxing crypto  Registration with the CFX essentially serves as a gateway for the government to monitor cryptocurrency transactions for tax purposes.  It could be followed by some form of custodian for asset storage and liquidity monitoring, as well as a clearing house for recording transactions for tax compliance, according to the 2019 Bappebti regulations. But those could be a while away.  ""Regarding clearing and custodian, there are still challenges in the implementation mechanism,"" said Robby.  Besides, all this hinges on Indonesia’s classification of crypto as commodities. An upcoming regulatory overhaul in 2025 will shift the purview of regulation from Bappebti to the country’s Financial Services Authority (OJK). This means crypto could be reclassified as securities.  Although it’s unclear what role the bourse will play when this change comes about, it could mean good news for crypto traders. As commodities, crypto has been subject to Value Added Tax (VAT) and Income Tax (PPh) since May. But if crypto assets are considered securities, taxes might be reduced, according to Robby.  ""There’s a chance we could remove VAT and lower income tax rates to be less burdensome for crypto exchanges to pay taxes,” Robby said during a Dec. 13 CoinDesk Indonesia Telegram podcast. “This is to ensure that Indonesia can compete globally.""

Source: Coingecko Mina’s Surge: CEO Appointment And Swiss Relocation This surge in MINA’s value is not a mere coincidence; it’s the result of a convergence of significant developments that have unfolded in recent weeks. December 19 marked a pivotal moment when the Mina Foundation announced the appointment of Kurt Hemecker as the new CEO, a distinguished business development specialist in the FinTech space. Simultaneously, the foundation strategically relocated its operations to Geneva, Switzerland, amplifying the positive sentiment surrounding MINA due to anticipated regulatory benefits and enhanced networking opportunities within the cryptocurrency community. MINAUSD currently trading at $1.260 territory. Chart: TradingView.com Another driving force behind MINA’s remarkable surge is the introduction of the Paima ZK layer. A collaborative effort involving Paima Studios, Mina, ZekoLabs, and Class Lambda, this layer represents a groundbreaking leap in blockchain gaming technology. It can deploy Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to any Layer 1 (L1) ecosystem, supporting both EVM and non-EVM codebases.

His peak balance was $4 million,” Arkham posted on X. “Based on the deposits, so far, he's sold 1,075 ETH for $2.4 million.”  These ether were generated as royalties from the official Trump non-fungible token (NFT) collection on marketplace OpenSea. Sending holdings to an exchange often implies sales for other tokens or U.S. dollars, although this isn’t compulsory.  Arkham tracks the wallet on its platform and it holds $2.2 million worth of various tokens as of Thursday. It tied the wallet to Trump in August based on public financial disclosures, which mentioned the same amounts of token holdings as found in a wallet holding the largest royalties derived from the Trump NFT sale.  Despite being a crypto skeptic during his term as president, Trump appears to have been a crypto user in recent years – likely even sitting on profits from the industry’s price gyrations.

Per 10x's latest research note, MSTR's shares appear overvalued by 26%. The conclusion is based on the firm's regression model, studying the relationship between the dependent variable, MSTR, and the independent variable, BTC's spot price.  ""As the regression model shows, MicroStrategy is +26% overvalued and has a 20% downside based on the current Bitcoin prices. It is time to take profit,"" 10x said.  Shares in bitcoin-holder MSTR have more than quadrupled this year, reaching a 25-month high of $673 on Wednesday to become one of the best-performing crypto-related stocks of 2023. The Nasdaq-listed firm holds 189,150 BTC as of writing, having begun accumulating the cryptocurrency as a reserve asset three years ago. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has gained 160% this year, with prices surging 60% this quarter alone, mainly on the back of the spot ETF narrative.  The performance of crypto-related stocks like MSTR and shares in Coinbase relative to bitcoin is often touted as a proxy for institutional interest in digital assets. These listed instruments allow market participants to gain exposure to digital assets without having to own them.  The chart shows the upward-sloping (green) line of best fit drawn through a maximum number of points on a scatter plot, ensuring almost an equal number of points above and below the line.  The upward-sloping nature of the line shows a positive relationship between bitcoin and MSTR. In other words, as the price of BTC goes up, MSTR's market value rises. The R² (R-squared or the coefficient of determination) of 0.8232 indicates that 80% of the variation in MSTR can be explained by BTC's price.  The analysis shows that at Thursday's closing price of $673, MSTR is overvalued by 20% relative to bitcoin's going market rate of around $43,000.  According to 10x, several crypto-related stocks are trading at close to fair value based on bitcoin's price.  ""We suggest taking profit and cutting long positions.

Notably, the ETC Group has released a comprehensive report shedding light on the potential for new all-time highs in 2024 and an impressive milestone of $100,000 by year-end. Bitcoin Price Recovery Sets The Stage For A Promising 2024 According to the ETC Group’s recent report, 2023 served as a recovery year for Bitcoin and crypto assets, with pivotal catalysts setting the stage for the following year. Per the report, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF filing in June 2023 laid the groundwork for increased adoption of this emerging asset class in 2024 and beyond. Related Reading: Crypto Trading Firm Expects Bitcoin To Crash To $36,000, Here’s Why Despite the progress made, the report highlights that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy in terms of adoption in most developed countries. Global surveys indicate an adoption rate of approximately 18%, suggesting that roughly one in five individuals worldwide holds some crypto asset. One of the highly anticipated events expected to drive Bitcoin price appreciation is the BTC Halving scheduled for the end of April 2024. While some argue that the halving is already priced in due to its public knowledge, historical data demonstrates significant price increases following previous halvings. Notably, the ETC Group’s base case prediction forecasts that Bitcoin’s price will reach new all-time highs in 2024 and surpass $100,000 by the year’s end. On-Chain Metrics Signal Bullish Outlook For BTC In 2024 Several on-chain metrics indicate that Bitcoin’s supply is scarcer this cycle than the previous one. According to the report, key indicators such as the percentage of exchange supply at a 5-year low and the all-time high percentage of supply in the last 1+ years suggest a potential bull market with increased distribution of accumulated coins to new investors. Additionally, macro factors, including the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, a likely US recession, a reversal of monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, contribute to a favorable outlook for the Bitcoin price in 2024. Related Reading: Polygon Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle, Analyst Puts This Target A major point of discussion among investors revolves around the potential price impact if a spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved in the US. The report highlights that variations in global Bitcoin ETP flows have explained approximately 40% of Bitcoin’s price variation over the past six months. Assuming that 20% of investors would consider such an investment and allocate 3% of their assets under management (AuM) to Bitcoin, an estimated $33.5 billion of new capital could enter the market. This influx of funds, almost doubling the global Bitcoin ETP AuM, could lead to a price impact of around 98%. Overall, the ETC Group’s in-depth analysis and predictions suggest an auspicious year for Bitcoin price 2024. With anticipated new all-time highs and the possibility of surpassing $100,000 by year-end, Bitcoin’s growth trajectory shows no signs of slowing down.

The founder moved 2.5 million CRV on December 27. This transfer may ruffle investors, raising concerns because it could indicate that Erogov is likely liquidating. CRV Is Firm, Up 60% In The Last 3 Months While the founder’s sale of CRV could put downward pressure, the token remains firm and is up roughly 60% from September 2023 lows. The token trades above $0.60 at spot rates, rejecting selling pressure as the daily chart shows. Related Reading: Polygon Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle, Analyst Puts This Target If bulls press on, it could break above $0.72 to record new 2023 highs. The token is trending higher, rejecting bear attempts amid improving sentiment across the crypto scene. Although Erogov is selling CRV, the market seems to interpret the move as bullish. The spectacular revival of CRV is net bullish for the protocol, suggesting that investors are still confident despite headwinds in early H2 2023 when several Curve pools were exploited due to a Vyper compiler issue. Curve Founder Sold CRV To Prevent Liquidation Of DeFi Loans Following the hack in late July 2023, Erogov was forced to liquidate a large chunk to prevent liquidation. On its part, the hack led to over $52 million in crypto assets, including 7.19 million worth of CRV, lost. In the aftermath of the hack, prices crashed. At the time of this hack, Erogov had over $100 million in DeFi loans backed by 427.5 million CRV as collateral. As CRV prices fell, the health of Egorov’s loans fell in tandem. If the value of Egorov’s CRV collateral were to fall further, it could face liquidation. This meant that all protocols from where the founder had borrowed using CRV as collateral would have been forced to sell the token at spot rates to repay the loan. As an automated intervention, the event would have likely caused a cascade, even impacting ordinary holders using CRV as collateral. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Reach $130,000, Here’s When To avoid this and as a form of intervention, Tron founder Justin Sun and multiple other parties, including Jeffrey Huang, made deals to buy CRV from the Curve founder, preventing this liquidation from happening.

21829346,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567166,1703728827,Binance Coin (BNB) Blazes Ahead: Predictions Point To New All-Time Highs In First Half Of 2024,"Binance Coin (BNB), despite experiencing a significant decline earlier this year due to market volatility and the SEC lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), has shown remarkable recovery and promising prospects. Recent data indicates a resurgence in the BNB price, driven by the growing usage of decentralized applications (DApps) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Additionally, BNB’s fundamentals, including impressive market cap figures and increased revenue, further contribute to the positive momentum. BNB Price Rally Fueled By DApp Adoption? After witnessing a sharp decline from its yearly high of $350, BNB experienced a drop to the $203 level following the SEC lawsuit against Binance and CZ. However, recent price movements show signs of recovery and bullish sentiment. Over the past 24 hours, BNB has gained 4.5%, and its performance in the seven, fourteen, and thirty-day time frames demonstrates an upward trend, with gains of 20%, 24%, and 38%, respectively. Related Reading: Crypto Trading Firm Expects Bitcoin To Crash To $36,000, Here’s Why One of the driving factors behind BNB’s price rally is the increasing use of DApps on the Binance Smart Chain. Data from DappRadar reveals a surge in DApp volume, currently at $4.83 billion, representing a 12% increase. The BNB chain boasts an ecosystem of 5,120 DApps and has recorded 4.89 million transactions, reflecting a 12.73% surge in the past seven days. These figures indicate a growing demand for BNB as it serves as the primary token within the BSC ecosystem. Comparing BNB to Ethereum (ETH), DappRadar data highlights BNB’s superior performance in various indicators such as contracts, total unique active wallets (UAW), decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL), and non-fungible token (NFT) volume. The BNB chain has held the top position over the past 24 hours, showcasing its usage and adoption. This outperformance contributes to the positive market sentiment surrounding BNB and bolsters its price. Binance Coin Market Cap Surges To $48 Billion Further boosting the Binance Coin prospects, Token Terminal data reveals impressive market cap figures for BNB, with a circulating market cap of $48.02 billion, marking a 14.18% increase. Additionally, BNB’s fully diluted market cap stands at the same value, reflecting a 28.32% growth. The revenue generated by BNB in the past 30 days has increased by 28.51%, reaching $1.47 million. Furthermore, BNB has recorded significant fee growth, with a 27.98% fee increase over the past 30 days and an annualized revenue of $187.56 million. These fundamentals contribute to the positive sentiment surrounding BNB. Overall, Binance Coin has staged a strong recovery, demonstrating a notable price rally driven by the increasing usage of DApps on the Binance Smart Chain. However, there is a bold prediction by a crypto analyst that could further boost the sentiment and excitement surrounding the token. Binance Coin To Reach New Yearly High? According to Captain Faibik, a prominent crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), Binance Coin is poised to achieve a new yearly high in the first half of 2024. This prediction is based on an analysis of BNB’s 1-week chart, revealing a breakout from a descending triangle pattern, signaling the end of the macro downtrend and initiating a new uptrend phase for BNB. Looking at the chart below, Faibik suggests that BNB’s price could potentially experience an impressive uptrend of 171% in the initial weeks of 2024. This surge would propel the token’s price above the current all-time high (ATH) of $686. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Explode 58,000% To $352 However, several resistance levels must be overcome for this projection to materialize. Notably, at the current trading price of $307, BNB faces a significant seven-month resistance barrier, which currently hinders its ascent to the $314 level, the next resistance level in the near term. Analyzing the 1-day chart, it becomes evident that reaching the all-time high level would require surpassing additional macro resistance levels, including $329, $402, $450, $563, $607, $639, and $653. While the theory proposed by Faibik holds promise, the actual realization of Binance Coin’s new yearly high in the early months of 2024, along with a sustained uptrend, remains to be observed.

Amidst the swirling currents of the crypto market, Ethereum stands at the cusp of what some analysts are predicting to be a ‘transformative period.’ This anticipation stems from two crucial developments: an impending network upgrade and the potential approval of Ethereum-based spot ETFs, according to renowned analyst CryptosRUs. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Bullish Outlook: Analyst Predicts Surge To Near $4,000 Levels By Early 2024 Catalysts For Growth: Upgrades And Spot ETF Approval The Ethereum network is gearing up for its next major upgrade, slated for January 2024. This upgrade, known in the crypto community as the Dencun Upgrade, is expected to usher in a range of enhancements to boost network efficiency. Key among these improvements are features designed to shrink transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet. This move could significantly ease congestion issues that have long been a concern for users and developers. Additionally, modifications to smart contract operations and enhancements to staking protocols are on the cards, setting the stage for an optimized Ethereum ecosystem. According to CryptosRUs, the anticipated Dencun Upgrade is not the only factor fueling optimism for Ethereum’s growth in 2024. The analyst has further highlighted the potential impact of approving a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Ethereum. Such a development could mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum, potentially driving widespread adoption and significant price appreciation. The analyst points out that approving an Ethereum spot ETF could mirror the influence seen in other markets, substantially boosting investor confidence and market liquidity. Over the past few weeks, we have seen rotations of capital through several crypto ecosystems, including #CosmosEcosystem , #Solana, #Injective, #BRC20s, and #Avalanche.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been extending its timeline for decision-making on both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. With numerous applications pending, the crypto market awaits the SEC’s verdict, which is anticipated to arrive in 2024. The SEC noted in a recent filing: The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and issues raised therein. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s performance continues to exhibit resilience and growth. Over the past year, Ethereum’s value has increased by 88.2%, with a continued upward trajectory evident in recent trading periods. At the time of writing, ETH has experienced a 5.3% surge in the last 24 hours, trading at $2,346. Furthermore, CryptosRUs analysis also extends to ETH, which has shown price movements analogous to Solana’s (SOL) recent surge. SOL’s value has soared by over 100% in the past month, leading the analyst to draw parallels with Ethereum’s potential price trajectory.
