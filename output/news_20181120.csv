42402233,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3hlJ,1542753016,"Bitcoin Cash SV's 'Blockchain Reorg' Likely an Accidental Split, Not an Attack","Bitcoin Cash ""Satoshi's Vision"" – otherwise called Bitcoin SV – suffered a block reorganization Monday by which transactions on two different blocks were overwritten.  Though it is possible these two blocks may have been maliciously overwritten by outside attackers, the most likely explanation for the temporary block reorg was due to an overload in transaction activity caused by a planned stress test.  Aimed at being ""the biggest test ever conducted on any public blockchain"" on its official webpage, the self-proclaimed Bitcoin Cash Professional Stress Test group is largely made up of Bitcoin SV proponents who wanted to ""showcase the Bitcoin [Cash] network capacity.""  The group planned to send more than 24 million transactions to see how each network would handle the volume following the bitcoin cash network's split after its scheduled hard fork last Thursday.  However, according to Bitcoin ABC developer Jonathan Toomim, the stress test only ended up firing on the Bitcoin SV chain.  Toomim told CoinDesk:  ""They were trying to spam both BCH and BSV but they made a mistake and split their coins early on. So their spam is only reaching BSV.""  What happened  As a result of large transaction volume, the Bitcoin SV network temporarily suffered a mini-fork yesterday in which competing iterations of the blockchain caused computer servers – also called nodes – supporting the network to fall out of sync with one another. To re-align Bitcoin Cash SV nodes and converge the forked blocks into one chain again, certain blocks were reorganized.  Block reorganizations – in short ""reorgs"" – occur as a result of the consensus protocol called proof-of-work (PoW) overseeing how transactions get validated on platforms such as bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Because PoW requires miners to expend large amounts of hash power – also understood simply as computation energy – in a race to append the next correct block in the chain, at times miners may propose new blocks at similar time intervals.  When this happens, though miners usually announce to the entire network that a block has been found immediately, the number of transactions being included into the block and thereby the overall amount of data that must be transmitted throughout the network may be slow to propagate.  This was the case yesterday when slow block propagation caused two blocks on the Bitcoin SV chain to be rewritten.  Peter Rizun, chief scientist at Bitcoin Unlimited – a company producing a leading software implementation for bitcoin cash – told CoinDesk that according to his calculations, Bitcoin SV blocks are currently propagating at a rate of about ""[five] seconds per megabyte.""  ""That is very slow ... The probability that another block is found in [a] 100-second interval is ... 15.3 percent. Normally, the probability of orphaning is below 1 percent,"" said Rizun.  The reason for this in part is due to the increase in block size from 32 MB to 128 MB on the Bitcoin SV blockchain.  Though a greater number of transactions are able to be fit on a given block, the network – when overloaded with transactions – is unable to transmit data about newly issued blocks to all network participants and avoid competing iterations of what the last confirmed block of transactions was.  Toomim explained that in short, ""big blocks take longer to propagate.""  A known complication  Calling the situation an “orphan race” where blocks become abandoned or excluded from the main chain over time, Toomim added that the bottlenecks to block propagation on the network likely wouldn't occur on the Bitcoin ABC chain due to the comparatively smaller block sizes seen on the network, in addition to other technical features that delay or ignore any transactions that cause the network undue stress.  ""If the same kind of test is done with Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin ABC will have about the same throughput but because we have limits in place the excess transaction will be either delayed or ignored, usually delayed,"" said Toomim.  He elaborated that the ""delaying of excessive transaction throughput"" during stress test scenarios ensured that all nodes remain in consensus about what the most recent block is, ensure blocks are propagated more quickly to the network and as a whole allow ""the entire network to operate more efficiently.""  Not a new concern, the issue of scaling transaction volume on larger block sizes has been a well-known topic of discussion within the bitcoin cash community since as early as August.  To this, Rizun told CoinDesk that ""nothing that is happening is unexpected.""  ""[Craig Wright] and the SV people didn’t believe what the scientists and engineers were saying about the current scalability limitations, and now they are proving us right while the world is watching,"" he added.  Another promise  Indeed, several spectators of the bitcoin cash split have called out the clear limitations to the Bitcoin SV network as a result of yesterday’s intentional transaction spam.  Chris Pacia, lead developer for e-commerce platform OpenBazaar, warned that as a result of the block reorg ""someone could have lost money if they received a payment and considered it final after two confirmations only to have the transaction be reversed.""  He added that in his view:  ""The ABC side has been adamant in saying that the network cannot yet handle large blocks and the BSV side were being reckless pushing for a 128MB block size. So a two block reorg demonstrates pretty clearly that the ABC side was right.""  Nevertheless, in the face of criticism, Wright maintains that flaws to network capacity on the Bitcoin SV chain are far from fatal, and instead encouraged businesses to begin operating on the network as normal.  ""Going forward we will start to open up and allow business use of the Bitcoin blockchain ... In the coming years, we plan to support an unbounded blocksize and as many transactions as people are willing to send us,” wrote Wright in a Medium post (he refers to the Bitcoin Cash SV network as bitcoin).  Speaking directly to the events of yesterday, Wright conceded on Twitter that there were ""areas we need to improve"" and affirmed that he was well aware of ""what is needed.""  In the same tweet, Wright promised that in six months' time transaction capacity would increase to 2,500 transactions per second on the Bitcoin SV network.

42402250,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3htB,1542741397,Capitulation? This Bitcoin Sell-Off Still Isn't as Extreme as 2015's,"A total of $60 billion has been erased from the value of all cryptocurrencies over the last week, a decline that has many wondering if the ongoing bear market for the asset class has finally come to an end.  Defined as a period of depressed activity and sentiment, the bear market has seen the price of bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, decline more than 75 percent from all-time highs set in January. Further, as bitcoin makes up more than 50 percent of the entire market in terms of total capitalization, it's safe to say the bear market may end when bitcoin bulls refuse to cede more ground.  But in order for a true ‘bottom’ to be found, many figure a ""capitulation"" needs to take place, since it is traditionally the last stage of a prolonged bear market.  By definition, capitulation is characterized by extreme panic selling backed by high volume that builds momentum until an eventual ""bottom"" is found. The bottom is a price level where the asset looks too cheap or undervalued to investors for them to allow it to fall any further.  It’s difficult to consider something to have officially capitulated until after it has occurred, but by looking at previous capitulation stages and market bottoms for BTC, there are a few signs traders and investors alike can watch out for that may allude to an official market bottom  2015's bottom  From 2013-2015, BTC experienced a bear market similar to the one occurring now, in which it reached an all-time high of $1,163 in November, 2013 and eventually fell 86 percent to bottom out at $152 in January, 2015.  From that day forward, the price never retreated below $152, according to data from the Bitstamp exchange.  If that particular market bottom is an example of true capitulation, it's clear there are two factors paramount to achieving capitulation: volume climaxes and rapid price declines.  As can be seen in the above chart, the sell-off for BTC began to accelerate at the beginning of 2015, but did not reach an extreme until two weeks later.  On Jan. 15, fear and panic in the market reached its peak. The price of BTC dropped 30 percent in a single 4-hour candlestick that was backed by its most sell volume in several months – an extreme selling event like this creates a volume climax which tends to be the precursor to a market bottom.  The sign that likely cemented this point in time as the bottom was what followed the selling climax – even more buy volume. At this point, fear in the market officially met demand and those still interested in BTC considered the $152 price tag too cheap to let it slip any further.  Bitcoin today  As can be seen below, the market is again experiencing a significant sell-off, but so far has been more gradual than the capitulation experienced in 2015.  This is evident in that no single 4-hour candlestick has recorded more than a 9 percent loss whereas the single “market bottoming” four-hour candlestick in 2015 recorded a 30 percent loss.  That said, sell volume has clearly picked up pace over the last couple of days and the current four-hour chart is showing promising signs for an ""at least temporary"" bottom.  As can be seen in the above chart, sell volume is beginning to lessen and diverge from the falling price, a sign sell orders are drying up. What’s more, the last four-hour candle just bullishly engulfed the prior candlestick with a notable uptick in buying volume.  A candle is considered to be ‘bullish engulfing’ when its body completely covers that of the prior candle, these types of candle tend to form at the bottom of downtrends but are more powerful the higher the timeframe.  Should be noted, capitulation events do not immediately reverse the long-term trend of a market. After BTC bottomed out in Jan. 2015, it largely traveled sideways for another 10 months before beginning a new uptrend toward the end of the year.  Such extreme selling events are also very rare, so it's unlikely for the exact market conditions of 2015 to be replicated this time around. It's safe to say though when true capitulation occurs, you'll know.  Disclosure: The author holds BTC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.

Announced Tuesday via a company blog post, Bakkt's first product, unveiled in August, has now been postponed to Jan. 24, 2019. Trading and warehouse operations are both expected to begin on that date.  The platform explained that ""the new listing timeframe will provide additional time for customer and clearing member onboarding prior to the start of trading and warehousing of the new contract.""  In an announcement on Medium, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler expanded on this statement, saying that the ""volume of interest"" in the company and the ""work required to get all the pieces in place"" contributed to the delay.  She added:  ""As is often true with product launches, there are new processes, risks and mitigants to test and re-test, and in the case of crypto, a new asset class to which these resources are being applied. So, it makes sense to adjust our timeline as we work with the industry toward launch.""  Bakkt previously anticipated launching its futures trading next month, saying in a notice that it would launch the product on Dec. 12. The new date is still subject to regulatory approval, indicating that the platform may not have received such approval yet.  The platform previously revealed it would launch physically-settled bitcoin futures, meaning clients would receive bitcoin upon the expiration of their contracts, rather than the token's cash equivalent.  However, the company may offer more than just bitcoin futures, Loeffler hinted Tuesday. Later in her post, she noted that ""we are taking opportunities in our start-up phase to expand our offering.""  ""We’ll share more about some of these new features in the coming weeks but as a start, I’m pleased to announce that we have insurance for bitcoin in cold storage and are in the process of securing insurance for the warm wallet within the Bakkt Warehouse architecture,"" she said.  The company is focused on building an institutional-grade cryptocurrency warehouse, she said, adding that ""we ... believe this is a significant step in building confidence in this asset class.""  As part of its efforts to develop the product, Bakkt previously announced it was working with BCG, Microsoft and Starbucks. The companies provided assistance in both customer experience and risk management for the product.

Speaking at an event in London covering the regulation of cryptocurrencies, Christopher Woolard, executive board member and director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said that the watchdog has concerns that retail investors are being sold ""complex, volatile and often leveraged derivatives products"" based on cryptocurrencies with ""underlying market integrity issues.""  He added:  ""The FCA will ... consult on a prohibition of the sale to retail consumers of derivatives referencing certain types of crypto assets (for example, exchange tokens), including contracts-for-difference, options, futures and transferable securities.""  Exchange tokens, he added, are the regulator's ""neutral"" way of describing cryptocurrencies, which ""utilize a DLT platform and are not issued or backed by a central bank or other central body,"" and ""do not function as money.""  By the end of the year, the FCA also plans to consult on which crypto assets fall within its existing regulatory remit and those that don't, said Woolard. Follow up consultation would then look at whether the agency needs a broader remit to ""capture crypto assets that have comparable features to specified investments.""  Elsewhere in the speech, the executive director also said the U.K. Treasury will make a ""comprehensive"" response to the use of crypto assets in financial crimes by meeting and going beyond the requirements of the fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD).  ""On this, [the Treasury] will first consult and then legislate on how to transpose 5AMLD and broaden the scope of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulation further,"" he said.  Woolard concluded by saying, with the FCA's Cryptoassets Taskforce believing that cryptocurrencies bring new challenges to traditional financial regulation, the Treasury now plans to further study if regulation can ""meaningfully and effectively"" address the risks they pose and what, if any, solutions might be arrived at.  ""[The Treasury] will consult in early 2019 on whether and how exchange tokens, as well as related actors such as exchanges and wallet providers, could be regulated effectively,"" he said, adding it will also seek collaborations with international counterparts to address the issue.

42402227,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3hdR,1542730224,Bitcoin Price Now On Pace to Post Worst Month in 2018,"Bitcoin’s drop to 13-month lows has likely put the cryptocurrency on the path to post its worst monthly loss of 2018.  The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at roughly $4,700 – down roughly 26 percent from the monthly opening price of $6,320 – according to CoinDesk market data.  As of now, November is the second-worst month of 2018, the first being March with a 32 percent price drop. November, however, would take the top spot if prices find acceptance below $4,200, pushing the monthly loss above 32 percent.  Indeed, BTC could regain some poise in the next ten days, as the record low on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is signaling extreme oversold conditions. In that case, November may become the second-worst month of the year or may even slip lower. However, a monthly loss looks like a done deal as a rally all the way back to $6,320 is unlikely to happen in the near-term.  This is because the demand side pressures may have weakened significantly in the last few days.  Moreover, a significant majority was expecting BTC to end its prolonged period of consolidation with a bullish breakout. The cryptocurrency, however, fell below $6,000 – a level where prices had supposedly carved out a long-term bottom – trapping many on the wrong side of the market.  Bitcoin November performance  As seen above, BTC scored gains in November in the last six years, including a 53.8 percent gain last year that saw the 2017 bull run accelerating as 2018 approached. As the data indicates, that winning streak is on pace to end this year.

Citing individuals familiar with the probe, Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the DOJ is looking into whether crypto exchange Bitfinex and Tether Ltd. have pushed bitcoin's price up using the stablecoin. Specific details of the investigation were not shared, and no accusations of wrongdoing have yet been made.  However, concerns about tether have long existed in the public sphere, with researchers at the University of Austin publishing a study this summer linking the stablecoin's issuance with bitcoin's 2017 price pumps.  The two found that even a small amount of tether used to buy bitcoin would help prop up the world's oldest cryptocurrency's price.  The CFTC has already subpoenaed Bitfinex and Tether, although it is unclear what information the regulator sought in those subpoenas.  A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request sent to the regulator by CoinDesk asking for information about the subpoenas was denied due to a number of exemptions, including ones related to law enforcement investigations.  The DOJ first began its criminal investigation this past May alongside the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). At the time, the DOJ was reportedly looking into spoofing – the use of large volumes of fake orders to influence market prices – as well as whether traders were faking volume to trick other investors into participating in the market.  Representatives for Bitfinex and Tether, as well as the DOJ and the CFTC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42402229,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3hfP,1542724215,OKEx Blasts 'Defamatory' Allegations Amid BCH Futures Settlement Furor,"Cryptocurrency exchange OKEx has pushed back against allegations made by Hong-Kong based trading firm Amber AI over its early settlement of bitcoin cash (BCH) futures contracts last week.  Calling a Monday blog post from the firm ""defamatory,"" OKEx said in a statement on Tuesday that the allegations are “completely false” and have caused “serious damages"" to its reputation.  The post alleges that the way OKEx had forced early settlement of bitcoin cash futures contracts at the last traded price on Nov. 14 – a day before a hard fork of the bitcoin cash blockchain that resulted in two new competing cryptos – was ""indicative of outright market manipulation and one of the more serious acts of fraud in the history of limit order book trading in the cryptocurrency markets.""  Traders have reportedly claimed losses in light of the early settlement, with one fund founder telling Bloomberg that they had incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses. OKEx later provided an explanation of the early delivery last week, stating that there was no trading pair with bitcoin cash with “enough market depth and trading volume to compose an index for delivery.”  In its response, OKEx said that: ""The early settlement of BCH Futures Contracts was implemented based on the consideration of market integrity and customer interests.""  The exchange added that it was “confident” that the move was the “best” option available and pointed to a clause on its futures contracts user agreement stating that under certain conditions it may postpone or bring about early settlement and delivery.  Messy situation  As might be expected, the spat has resulted in what essentially amounts to finger-pointing following the futures settlement.  Amber AI honed in on an OKEx change to the way the futures indices were calculated on Nov. 12, saying:  ""This is no different than the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announcing that the S&P 500 E-Mini Futures will settle against the Shanghai Composite Index in the midst of trading.""  ""We see this as a deliberate attempt to interfere with prices of the underlying futures contracts, amidst live trading,"" the trading firm stated.  ""The settlement price of OKEx’s futures contracts is constructed based on the spot index,"" OKEx said. ""And the BCH index constituents – BCH spot price of Coinbase, Binance, and OKEx – have already paused trading, which made it impossible to create a BCH index price for settlement. Under the circumstances, we had made the decision to perform an early settlement.""  OKEx further said Tuesday that it reserves the right to take legal action against Amber AI for “interfering” with its business and that it would disclose any evidence required in the court to prove it was ""not involved in the alleged trading.""  The exchange stressed that it would ""never trade against our customers and manipulate the market.""  OKEx elsewhere stated that it does not actually have any institutional client named Amber AI and that it does not serve any customer in Hong Kong “in respect of the local laws and regulations.”  “Amber AI made profit from the individual account on OKEx they claimed to have managed during the early delivery,” it said.  Refuting that claim to CoinDesk on Tuesday, Amber AI said:  ""We hold multiple trading accounts on OKEx including corporate accounts of [Amber] group’s subsidiaries and individual accounts of the group’s main founders.""  Calling for OKEx to give a ""proper explanation"" of its actions regarding the futures settlement, Amber AI said: ""The focus should be on a series of irregular activities on OKEx between Nov. 14 and Nov. 18 and how the industry should embrace regulation to avoid market manipulation and to protect investors.""

42402232,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3hjL,1542716138,Russian ICO That Impersonated Bank Hit With Cease-and-Desist,"North Dakota’s securities watchdog has issued a cease-and-desist order against a Russia-based initial coin offering (ICO) that appeared to impersonate Liechtenstein-based Union Bank AG to promote “unregistered and potentially fraudulent securities.”  On Monday, Karen Tyler, commissioner of the North Dakota Securities Department, said that the website of the supposed ICO project – called Union Bank Payment Coin (UBPC) – had “directly copied” elements from the Union Bank website, including style, wording, leadership information and images.  Claiming to be the “world’s first security token backed by a fully licensed bank” and offering a “stable coin that is fully backed by a fiat currency – the Swiss franc,” UBPC looked to be an attempt to defraud investors by basing its claims on a legitimate blockchain announcement made in August by the regulated and licensed bank, Tyler said.  While the IP address for Union Bank's website is located in Liechtenstein, UBPC's is located in Russia and is registered to an individual, according to the statement.  “Union Bank AG is, of course, not the subject of this Cease and Desist Order. Please be aware of potential scammers,” the bank told CoinDesk in an email response.  It added:  “The only way to participate in Union Bank AG’s coin offerings is via a direct contact with the bank. There are no websites for contributions or sign-ups, and no wallet addresses are available publicly or privately to send coins or fiat money.”  “Because ICOs are sold over the internet and pitched heavily through social media platforms, North Dakotans can be exposed to the offers whether the promoter is down the street or on the other side of the globe,"" Tyler said, adding:  “Financial criminals continue to cash in on the hype and excitement around blockchain, crypto assets, and ICOs – investors should be exceedingly cautious when considering a related investment.”  This is not the first time the watchdog has taken action against companies promoting suspect ICOs in the state. Last month, it issued orders against three others: Crystal Token, Life Cross Coin and Advertiza Holdings.  The story was updated to add Union Bank AG’s comment.

42402243,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3hv9,1542711669,"Bitcoin Price Drops to $4,200 Despite Record Low On RSI","Bitcoin’s price continues to slide despite the oversold conditions signaled on the technical charts for the last six days.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $4,200 soon before press time – a price low not seen since Oct. 5, 2017 – and was last seen trading at $4,484, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Notably, the 14 percent drop witnessed in the last 24 hours has pushed the widely followed 14-day relative strength index (RSI) below 10.00, its lowest reading on record. An asset is considered to be oversold and due for a corrective bounce when its RSI is below 30.00.  BTC’s RSI fell into oversold territory on Nov. 14, but a strong recovery rally has still not materialized. That said, a corrective bounce might be seen in the next 24 hours or so, as the low on the RSI is backed by a rise in BTC/USD longs.  Daily chart  As seen above, BTC has dropped 34 percent in the last five days, despite being so oversold.  The cryptocurrency’s inability to produce a notable recovery rally in such conditions could be considered a sign that bearish sentiment is currently very strong. Still, the bears should exercise caution in the next 24 hours.  BTC/USD Longs on Bitfinex  As seen above, long positions hit a 3.5-month high of 31,719 earlier today, having risen 34 percent in the last six days – both of which indicate that investors are buying the current dip.  Weekly chart  A corrective bounce, if any, will likely be short-lived as both descending triangle breakdown and the break of the seven-year-long rising trendline has likely set the tone for a drop to $4,100 (trendline connecting the January 2015 and April 2017 lows.)  View  The record low reading on the RSI and the steady rise in long positions indicates scope for a minor bounce, possibly to the descending 5-day EMA, currently at $5,050.  The weekly chart continues to favor a drop to the long-term rising trendline support of $4,100.  The immediate bearish outlook would be invalidated if a correction ends up pushing prices above the 10-day EMA of $5,424.

42402242,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3hhN,1542708060,Singapore's Stock Exchange Clarifies Rules for Listed Firms Issuing ICOs,"Singapore Exchange (SGX) has clarified the rules for publicly listed companies planning to conduct initial coin offerings (ICOs).  In a column published Thursday, Tan Boon Gin, CEO of the stock exchange's regulatory subsidiary, SGX RegCo, stressed that any tokens launched in an ICO are not listed on the SGX and that these rules are applicable only for the companies themselves.  As per the guidelines, any listed company planning to hold an ICO is required to consult with SGX RegCo in advance, as well as provide a legal opinion on the nature of tokens and an auditor’s opinion on how the ICO should be treated for accounting – both from ""reputable"" firms.  Companies are also required to make certain disclosures, including the rationale behind the ICO, the risks involved, how the raised funds would be used, planned know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks, and any impact on existing shareholders’ rights.  They also need to ensure that ICOs are “properly"" accounted for in their financial statements and that associated risks have been addressed.  Further, if the tokens are considered securities under the country’s Securities and Futures Act (SFA), issuers are required to complete prospectus registration and licensing procedures. Firms may also be required to form a subsidiary to carry out the ICO.  Finally, SGX RegCo expects listed issuers of ICOs to “safeguard” their own interests and that of shareholders. “The issuer’s board is ultimately responsible for maintaining a robust system of risk management and internal controls,” Gin said.  Back in August, Y Ventures Group became Singapore’s first public firm to hold an ICO, which aimed to raise $50 million for creating a blockchain-based e-commerce system.  To date, however, no token considered a security has been approved in the country by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), as Damien Pang, head of the MAS technology infrastructure office for fintech and innovation, told CoinDesk at a Consensus conference in September.

42402236,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3hoG,1542704418,Bitcoin Smart Contract Startup RSK Unveils New Infrastructure Project,"RSK Labs, the startup working on smart contract functionality for bitcoin by way of sidechains, is operating under a new banner as part of a wider reimagining of its development ecosystem.  The newly-dubbed Root Infrastructure Framework (RIF) Labs is headed by many of the same individuals that created the highly-anticipated platform in January of this year. It's a continuation of the work RSK Labs has been doing to date, with a specific focus on building ""easy-to-use interfaces and language libraries that simplify the use of blockchain infrastructure,"" according to CEO of RIF Labs Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar.  Unveiled this week, the company outlined the creation of five different code implementations or protocols to be integrated into the RSK smart contract platform. Collectively referred to the RIF Open Standard or RIF OS, each protocol is intended to simplify and streamline the development of decentralized applications, or dapps, and encourage broader adoption of blockchain tech as a programming tool.  Zaldivar told CoinDesk:  ""RIF Lab’s focus is on building technology that facilitates access to decentralized infrastructure enabling traditional developers, organizations, and innovators to bring to life the next generation of distributed applications.""  Open-source push  While traditionally focused on tools that operate alongside bitcoin – think of it as porting ethereum's functionality to the world's largest blockchain by market cap – Zaldivar added that ""all the software and intellectual property produced will be contributed to the community"" as free, open-source code.  The idea, he indicated, is to advance the use of the RIF OS protocols to other cryptocurrency platforms as well.  As it stands, one of the five RIF OS protocols has been released – with the four other protocols to do with varying blockchain operations including payments, data feeds, storage and communication channels – to follow shortly.  The one available now on the smart contract platform enables developers to do away with “complex blockchain address sharing,” as explained by Zaldivar, and replaces addresses with plain, user-friendly aliases for cryptocurrency and token accounts.  Not disclosing any major funders to the launch of RIF OS protocols just yet, Zaldivar told CoinDesk:  ""I would say we are well funded to move forward ... We don't share the actual details but I would say we have funding for the next five to seven years of operations.""

42402235,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3hnH,1542704414,IBM and Intel's Blockchain Tug of War,"When the governing board of Hyperledger approved a new supply chain project earlier this month, it marked a significant departure for the open-source blockchain consortium.  Sawtooth Supply Chain, as the project is provisionally called, breaks new ground because it’s arguably the consortium's first to really inhabit the application layer of the software stack. It's built on top of the Sawtooth framework, which Intel contributed to Hyperledger.  Prior to this, Hyperledger confined its work to the lower layers and eschewed the custom-design of blockchain application code with industry players in mind. That job was left to vendors to carry out in a proprietary manner – as IBM has been doing in its now-live food-tracking supply chain platform with the likes of Walmart.  Nevertheless, nine of the 11 Technical Steering Committee (TSC) members voted in favor of the new project on December 6. The approval of Sawtooth Supply Chain as a high-level project massively heightens its profile and means it enters Hyperledger’s formal project lifecycle and receives the support which goes along with that (community outreach, marketing, security review, etc.).  This happened over the objections of the other two members of the TSC, who questioned whether the project belonged within the scope of Hyperledger, CoinDesk has learned. Notably, both of them work at IBM: Arnaud Le Hors, who was absent from the vote, and Chris Ferris, the former TSC chair, who was present but abstained.  From the sidelines of the enterprise blockchain world, it looks like a tug-of-war has broken out, with IBM and its favored Hyperledger implementation, known as Fabric, on the one side, and the Intel-backed Sawtooth on the other. The latter team also has a budding champion in the form of newly appointed TSC chair, and Sawtooth lead maintainer, Dan Middleton of Intel.  As well as doing engineering further up the stack at the application layer, Sawtooth Supply Chain is the first project sponsored by a non-tech company, U.S. food giant Cargill. As such, the supply chain project, which has yet to be given a permanent name, will likely speed toward faster deployment than its Hyperledger peers. And given Cargill's involvement, it is a prospective rival to IBM's Food Trust.  However, the stakes are higher than a potential competition between supply chain-focused platforms coming out of Hyperledger, as the tensions point to bigger questions around governance.  While IBM argues that putting Hyperledger's imprimatur on an app-level project could undermine the consortium's position as a neutral player, others characterized the tech giant's resistance to the proposal as an attempt to stifle competition.  “This is fundamentally a discussion about what is open source software,” said James Mitchell, CEO of Bitwise, which wrote the bulk of Sawtooth 1.0 code and is contributing to the supply chain project. “And is the structure of an organization like Hyperledger ultimately to be protectionist around a set of commercial interests, or does it have a different set of goals?”  'Paying rent'  One way to look at the tensions over the supply chain project is as a sign of Hyperledger growing past its origins as an IBM-dominated organization.  Choosing his words carefully, TSC chair Middleton told CoinDesk that part of his job is to ensure diversity within Hyperledger and to retain those strengths from which blockchain gains its preeminence.  He acknowledged that IBM has been a big contributor to Hyperledger and to the open source effort, as have Intel and a lot of other organizations.  “I think it's important that no one of those organizations undermines the legitimacy of having an open source organization where we are all developing code transparently. We just want to make sure that we have a good balance among all the contributors,” said Middleton.  Mitchell of Bitwise was less diplomatic, claiming that IBM, with its early proliferation of Fabric, has used Hyperledger (and the consortium's affiliation with the Linux Foundation) as a way to market its services to enterprises – what he called “open-source washing.""  “You want to be able to tell a story about how you are building open source solutions. But where it matters, which is the bulk of the application code, you want to be able to retain proprietary ownership of intellectual property and be able to monetize the solution at that level,” Mitchell said of IBM’s blockchain strategy to date.  “I think people are savvy to this; they realize they don’t want to be paying rent to a large technology provider for the next two decades on these solutions,” he added.  Michell warned that blockchain may represent an even more aggressive form of lock-in than previous enterprise software licensing, once an industry adopts a particular lingua franca of how business is transacted.  “Based on conversations we have had with industry partners we are working with, like Cargill and others, we strongly believe industry needs to own those solutions,” rather than the vendors, said Mitchell.  This could take the form of closed-source, shared ownership amongst those parties, he said, or, better yet, open source software that those industries are building, contributing to and sharing.  Real or fabricated?  In expressing his concerns about widening the scope of Hyperledger to promote the Sawtooth supply chain project, IBM’s Ferris said this was his personal view and not an IBM-related matter.  He told CoinDesk:  “When we set up Hyperledger initially, we said we would not go into the application space. And we did that for a reason, because we want people to take the frameworks we are building and leverage them. We didn't want to be perceived somehow as competition to someone who is legitimately trying to build a solution around supply chain.”  Ferris added that the components being built in the new supply chain project are “pretty specific” to Sawtooth right now. That concerned him because, according to Hyperledger Governing Board guidance, top-level tools projects also need to be seen to support multiple frameworks rather than being overly focused on one.  Rather than be elevated to a top-level project, Sawtooth Supply Chain, in his opinion, should have been placed in Hyperledger Labs. This is where projects deemed too early for TSC approval for incubation, such as sample code from hackathons or research projects, are placed. If a Labs project wants to enter incubation and become a formal project, a project proposal must be submitted for TSC consideration.  Regarding Middleton's point about the need for greater diversity within Hyperledger, Ferris said this has been addressed, particularly over the last year or so, as many developers from a range of organizations have joined the community. IBM now accounts for maybe 30 percent of the total contributions, he said.  “In Fabric, we are about 40 percent of that total. I mean, it used to be 100 percent. So the number is constantly coming down. Yes, IBM is very committed to the success of Hyperledger. But by the same token, we are also trying not to be overbearing in that investment, “ said Ferris.  Gari Singh, a distinguished engineer and blockchain CTO at IBM, added that while it can be flattering to hear how much IBM has done with Fabric, the lack of contributions from other big industry players is frustrating.  “So you look at Oracle running Fabric; Amazon and their new managed blockchain service actually takes the Fabric samples and uses it, but no contributions back. There are contributions coming but they are coming from the start-ups – we would actually like to see it from the big guys,” said Singh.  True Blue  Elsewhere at last week’s Hyperledger Forum in Basel, Switzerland, some important members of the community took the opportunity to show their respect to IBM.  Casey Kuhlman, CEO of Monax, said the fact that the Sawtooth Supply Chain project has been brought under the auspices of Hyperledger speaks for itself; despite misgivings, IBM ultimately did not stand in the project's way, he said, adding that in his opinion Big Blue has behaved like a “very reasonable member of the community.”  “Their actions have been, in my opinion, very reasonably self-serving,"" Kuhlman said. ""Because at the end of the day we are all businesses and we are all trying to make money. We are all self-interested. We should be.”  Hyperledger director Brian Behlendorf said that while evolution is happening within the organization, the focus is still going to be on things that can be generally applicable.  “It’s not going to be just to solving Cargill's needs for a reusable body of code or template or recipe or whatever for a large number of use cases,” said Behlendorf.  Speaking to the success of the first Hyperledger Global Forum, which saw hundreds of firms from across a wide range of industries descend on Basel for four days of talks and workshops, Behlendorf also wanted to pay due respect to IBM, concluding,  “We would absolutely not be here if it were not for them.”  Intel's Dan Middleton at the Hyperledger Global Forum image via Ian Allison for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/20/ibm-and-intels-blockchain-tug-of-war,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a590bd8d3701ab87b21593fc927407973e0c503-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402241,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3huA,1542690067,Alabama: The Unlikely Frontline for America's Crypto Fraud Crackdown,"""Of the states, I think we've got about 20 percent of all the active cease-and-desists.""  That's Greg Bordenkircher, the chief litigator at the Alabama Securities Commission, describing the extent to which his state, just the 24th largest by population, has nonetheless come to play a leading role in the ongoing fight against U.S. crypto fraud.  ""We've issued nine orders shutting down businesses that are advertising in Alabama,"" he told CoinDesk. ""We have another 20, 22 that we are looking at right now.""  But Bordenkircher's agency is hardly alone. As a member of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), it's part of a coalition that's been conducting a continent-wide sweep of initial coin offerings in an effort to sniff out illicit activities. To date, regulators in South Carolina, Colorado and Texas have taken on suspect ICOs as well, and Canadian prosecutors have also played an important role in the sweep.  NASAA's website lists a number of actions taken by the State of Massachusetts, too.  The sweep started with a list of 300 or so projects, but the latest numbers have those being investigated down to 200 (some have been determined not to be fraudulent).  While much of the attention in crypto has been on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), state action is an important facet of chasing bad actors out of the market, he argued.  Bordenkircher told CoinDesk:  ""The SEC does a great job and CFTC does a great job, but the states have really got the boots on the ground. There's more of us than there are of them.""  Still, federal and state-level agencies are coordinating, sharing information and breaking up the work.  ""It's almost a task force view of all of us coordinating together,"" he said.  Bordenkircher (pictured above, seated) runs the Alabama wing of the operation, mainly with Michael Gantt (also pictured), a special agent assigned to the sweep, running the day-to-day efforts. The state contracts with Cyber Forensics, a consultancy that helps them keep all the digital evidence they gather defensible in court.  And that's really key to getting the ICO industry in control, because ""wherever the hot issue is, that's where the fraudsters go,"" Bordenkircher said.  Through almost all of 2017 and the first part of 2018, no doubt, that was ICOs.  From arms to coins  To stop the toxic ICOs, Bordenkircher has imported a battle plan he used at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for fighting arms traders.  Prior to his work with the state of Alabama, Bordenkircher served at the DOJ as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of the State of Alabama. There, he took a leadership role in complex litigation. One part of the strategy as it related to chasing arms dealers across the internet was looking for buyers and sellers and matching up their deals.  So when the NASAA began the sweep, Bordenkircher sought the same resources to repeat that and other strategies used during his time in the federal government.  The strategy involves setting up computer systems that are firewalled off (using virtual private networks) from the state systems that can visit suspicious websites and track activity without the people who built the site realizing they are being visited by law enforcement.  The system even uses a technique familiar to the cryptocurrency community – cryptographic hashes. These hashes preserve a website, proving the data was logged at a certain time and that it hasn't been changed, even though the system dismantles the site to keep other users from interacting with it.  To build this system, Alabama has contracted with online evidence gathering consultancy, Cyber Forensics, which Bordenkircher first worked with at the DOJ. Cyber Forensics make the first pass at various sites to determine whether or not a given project (or group of projects) has enough red flags to refer to Alabama's investigators for further action.  Both the contractors and the state investigators are looking for signs that projects are luring unsuspecting investors who lack the savvy to spot impossible claims.  Gus Dimitrelos, the president of Cyber Forensics and a former special agent with the U.S. Secret Service, told CoinDesk:  ""There's probably 12 to 17 different ways for these fraudsters to get victims to come to them.""  The red flags  Echoing this, Bordenkircher said, ""When we get X amount of red flags, then we have to make a legal determination at that point that this needs to be at least shut down, if not prosecuted.""  Provided prosecutors verify that the offering appears to be a security and that its soliciting citizens of their state without a license to deal securities, the state can then move forward on an investigation and further action.  To shut these projects down, the state will send suspected fraudsters a cease-and-desist letter that gives the operation 30 days to report back to the state if they believe their company has been erroneously targeted. So far, Bordenkircher told CoinDesk, no team has tried to defend their operation. Instead, they just close up shop in the state and disappear.  Although, one British company did respond, agreeing that it shouldn't solicit U.S. investors and then firewalled off the country.  While there's no official checklist that guarantees an operation is fraudulent, the investigators walked CoinDesk through a number of the things they look for – some of which would be difficult for an average web user to detect.    Multiple IPs – Multiple IP addresses that all point back to one company or person is not normal. In many cases, this can mean one operation is setting up multiple phony ICOs (or frauds of other kinds) and running them out of the same office.      Phony physical addresses – The street address might not square with what should be a legitimate business location. For instance, one ICO project's address turned out to be the same as that of the Ohio Attorney General.    Location masking – Is there evidence that the operation is making an effort to appear to be in the United States when it is, in fact, located overseas?    A non-sensical pitch – A frequent critique made about token projects is that companies are applying blockchain just to build buzz. Bordenkircher took that further for fraudulent ICOs, saying, ""Some of them, they have the verbiage, but I don't think they really understand what blockchain is.""    Copy-and-paste – If data is copy-and-pasted across multiple websites that appear to be marketing different projects, that's a clear red flag. This is a broadly used tactic by fraudsters in the crypto space, with the easiest area to use this being team photos, where the same stock photo faces are showing up across multiple project websites.    Unrealistic claims – ""What are they saying the returns going to be? A lot of them are using language like 'guaranteed return of 1 percent a day,' which is, it has to be fraudulent,"" Bordenkircher said. Or if they claim to have assets that don't make sense. For example, projects that claim to be backed by a diamond mine or projects that claim part of the returns will be paid out in actual gold sent to investors.    The next frontier  On top of these initial red flags, there are also a couple of behaviors that require investigators to take some kind of action first.    Aggressive sales – ""One of the badges of fraud is trying to see how aggressive they are trying to get us to send them money,"" Bordenkircher said. If an investigator emails once and they get multiple calls in return, that's a strong sign further investigation is needed. Good brokers will always follow up, he said, but it's fraudsters that do it to excess.      Selling to the wrong customers – Since the rules surrounding crypto token sales in the U.S. are still a bit opaque, many ICO projects have eschewed U.S. investors. While some projects state in their white papers and on their website that they won't accept U.S. investors, they still buy U.S. hosting services and run ads targeting U.S. customers. Then if a U.S.-based investor shows interest, the company won't hesitate to encourage them to send money.    To verify this kind of behavior, law enforcement needs to reach out. Since fraudsters wouldn't respond to such inquiries if they were suspicious law enforcement was behind them, the ability to hide behind a virtual private network is important.  But the next frontier for law enforcement in catching fraudsters will be setting up profiles that lure them in. Cyber Forensics has already begun building fake social profiles of people who show interest in investing and making money.  Just as the fraudsters have devised websites that lure victims, the company hopes it can find a formula that lures the predators.  And with these new techniques in the queue, Bordenkircher said, the action they've taken so far is nowhere close to all the action that will be taken to bring down phony crypto token projects. This is especially true since the courts have affirmed the authority of various agencies to bring action.  Speaking to this, Bordenkircher told CoinDesk:  ""It's only going to accelerate until there is a more regimented regulatory system.""  Yet, still, Bordenkircher is quick to acknowledge that the regulatory agency is trying to tread carefully so as not to stifle innovation in the space.  ""We don't want to limit in any way legitimate ICOs or legitimate utility coins or people who are trying to raise legitimate businesses,"" he said.
