42392904,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgCnKr,1690748743,Curve Finance Drained of $50M While CRV Token Sinks 12% in Latest DeFi Exploit,"Curve, a stablecoin exchange at the heart of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Ethereum, has been the victim of an exploit according to a tweet from the project.  Curve relies on smart contracts instead of middlemen to offer financial services such as stablecoin borrowing, trading and lending to users. Depositors on Curve earn annual yields of up to 4% from one of the many pools on the platform.  Upwards of $100 million worth of cryptocurrency are at risk due to a “re-entrancy” bug in Vyper, a programming language used to power parts of the Curve system. Several stablecoin pools on the platform — used for pricing and liquidity on a number of different DeFi services — have been drained by hackers so far.  ""As a result of an issue in Vyper compiler in versions 0.2.15-0.3.0, following pools were hacked: crv/eth, aleth/eth, mseth/eth, peth/eth,"" Curve tweeted Monday.  Reentrancy is a common bug that allows attackers to trick a smart contract by making repeated calls to a protocol in order to steal assets. A call is authorization for the smart contract address to interact with a user’s wallet address.  Other projects that use the Vyper programming language could share the same vulnerability.  It was unclear at press time how much had been drained from Curve as a result of the attack. BlockSec, a blockchain auditing firm, estimated the total losses above $42 million in a preliminary analysis posted to Twitter. Tarun Chitra, chief executive officer and founder of crypto risk modeling firm Gauntlet, estimated the exploiter made away with about $20 million of CRV and a version of ether.  Curve operates 232 different pools, according to its website, but only pools using Vyper versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0 are at risk, said mimaklas, a member of the team in a Discord announcement.  Mimaklas also said that ""all affected pools have been drained or white hacked, and the team is assessing the situation with affected teams.""  Elsewhere, lending and borrowing protocol Aave disabled its CRV borrowing function amid the panic. A massive $100 million CRV debt from Curve founder Michael Egorov on Aave is nearing liquidation - and if CRV prices were to continue to rise and reach the liquidation threshold, the protocols will have to liquidate the CRV positions.  Whitehat Sends Funds; CRV Sinks  Curve Finance has managed to get some money back thanks to bot operator ‘c0ffeebabe.eth’ returning 2,879 ETH, worth nearly $5.5 million at current prices, to the platform. These funds were ethically stolen from the hacker by front-running their malicious transaction.  The heist destabilized trading markets for Curve DAO’s native CRV token, which was down 17% on the day at a price of $0.61 as of press time. That price action threatened to compound the chaos by potentially forcing a liquidation on the founder of Curve’s $70 million borrowing position on Aave.  Meanwhile, the total value of assets locked on Curve nosedived to $1.7 billion on Monday from more than $3 billion on Sunday, according to data provider DeFiLlama, as investor capital likely fled the exchange.  UPDATE (July 30, 2023, 21:25 UTC): Adds additional information.

15457285,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545078,1690732852,Here’s How Long The Majority Of New Ethereum Wallets Are Used Before They’re Dumped,"Ethereum is currently the leader in decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and smart contracts, and it continues to maintain its position as the dominant cryptocurrency in the altcoin market. This has led to Ethereum having the highest rate of creation of new addresses when compared to the other blockchains. However, data suggests most of these new addresses are dumped just after a few days. New Ethereum Wallets Are Used for Only a Short Time Ethereum is second to Bitcoin in terms of unique addresses. Ycharts estimates put the number of unique addresses on the Ethereum network to around 239.62 million. However, on-chain transaction data shows that if you’ve just created a new Ethereum wallet, chances are you won’t be using it for long. Related Reading: Court Filing Suggests FTX’s $2 Billion Lawsuit Against Genesis Is Coming To An End According to crypto data analyst Jack Gorman, over 70% of new Ethereum wallets are used for less than 30 days before the owners stop transacting completely. While taking to a customized graph on Dune Analytics, a blockchain ecosystem analytics platform, the data analyst noted the rate of creation and abandonment of new Ethereum addresses. The data show that Ethereum has one of the highest rates of new addresses, with 2 million new wallets per month. In the past year alone, more than 26.69 million wallets were created. However, most new addresses display minimal activity, with 66% only active for one day and 95.5% being active for less than ten days. For instance, in May 2023, 2.41 million addresses were created, with only 6.91% making transactions after 30 days. ETH price sitting at $1,876 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Overall, monthly active addresses total around 4.5 million to 7 million. This means that most wallets don’t last long, and only 1.9 million are active for more than 10 days. Fewer addresses are used frequently and long-term, with only 400,000 addresses completing more than 100 transactions in the past year. Why Are There So ETH Addresses? Ethereum has had one of the most impressive adoption rates in recent years. The creation of new addresses provides valuable insights into improving adoption and longevity, and the creation and abandonment of addresses can be traced to airdrop hunters. Airdrop hunters create multiple addresses with the sole aim of farming ERC-20 tokens from airdrops.

In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Gary Gensler, the infamous Chairman of the US SEC, offered his critical views of the crypto industry. Gensler Disappointed by Ripple Ruling In a recent interview on Bloomberg Daybreak Podcast, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, declared the crypto sector as “a field rife with fraud, rife with hucksters” and hinted the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF in an industry with such supposed “poor compliance” is unlikely. Gensler’s response to Bitcoin ETFs seemed somewhat confusing and did not substantively address the issue. Instead, the Chairman answered in a defamatory note: “This is a field that, there’s a lot of non-compliance in this field, and, uh, that the platforms themselves, where trading is occurring of various crypto tokens, though some of it comes under the securities laws, currently they’re not necessarily compliant with those time-tested protections against fraud and manipulation.” The head of the SEC further stated the industry needs “more cops on the beat” to bring violators to justice. During the podcast, Gensler seemed unwilling to respond when prompted about Ripple’s recent partial victory over the SEC. Unsurprisingly, Gensler said he was “disappointed” in Judge Torres’ ruling. When asked to elaborate on his disappointment and the possibility of an appeal by the agency, chairman Gensler gave a vague and mysterious answer. He told the host: “The Commission has not acted on that, and if the staff makes a recommendation, we’ll have a discussion of it and we’ll take it up then. But I don’t really have anything more for you, for that.” Gensler also commented on consumer protection from the agency in this “highly speculative” industry: “Even though the securities laws apply to many of those tokens, without prejudging any one. But you as investors are not getting the full, fair, and truthful disclosure. And the platforms, the intermediaries, are doing things that we would never, in a day, allow or think the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq would do. The platforms, often, are commingling or trading against you and have market makers, often, that are on the other side of the trades.” Ripple CEO Blames SEC for Regulatory “Mess” Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, recently shared his views regarding the current regulatory “mess” whilst defending Judge Torres’s decision. Garlinghouse expressed his dismay with the SEC by saying: “An important topic has come up about protecting retail. The SEC created this mess by proclaiming it was the cop on the crypto beat when it had no legal jurisdiction Where’s that gotten us? Consumers left holding the bag in bankruptcy court while the SEC holds press conferences.” He continued by saying: “It’s absurd to blame a Judge for faithfully applying the law. We all know legislation – not more regulation by enforcement – is the only way forward to provide clear rules and protect retail.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

15454202,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/sec-warns-against-misleading-crypto-audits,1690725142,SEC Warns Against Misleading Crypto Audits,"The SEC’s principal advisor on accounting and auditing issued a statement this week warning accounting firms working as crypto “auditors” against publishing misleading reports. The US SEC warned firms acting as crypto “auditors” to carefully consider how their reports are marketed, claiming their work, in some instances, does not constitute the definition of auditing. Crypto “Audits” May Not Provide Reasonable Assurance to Investors Paul Munter, the SEC’s principal advisor on accounting and auditing, this week claimed in a statement that crypto companies have marketed their associations with accounting firms as auditors but said their work does not strictly comply with the definition of “auditing.” Munter said: “Certain crypto asset trading platforms, with others in the crypto industry, have marketed to investors their retention of third parties, sometimes accounting firms, to perform some sort of review of certain parts of their business, often presented as a purported “audit.” Mr Munter further warned accounting firms not to label their reports as “financial audits,” as they are not as rigorous or comprehensive as true financial statement audits. “As accounting firms increasingly engage in this sort of non-audit work, their clients’ marketing and terminology risks misleadingly suggesting that these alternative, non-audit arrangements are at parity with, or even more “precise” than, a financial statement audit.” He continued by saying: “Such suggestions are false. Non-audit arrangements are neither as rigorous nor as comprehensive as a financial statement audit, and may not provide any reasonable assurance to investors.” Proof-of-Reserves Are Inherently Limited, and Customers Should Exercise Caution The SEC’s accounting and audit principal referenced a public statement the Public Company Account Oversight Board (PCAOB) made in March. The board stated “proof-of-reserves are inherently limited” and “customers should exercise extreme caution when relying on them to conclude that there are sufficient assets to meet customer liabilities.” Mr Munter advised accounting firms that carry out reports that do not constitute financial statement audits but are labelled as such by a crypto firm to take immediate action. He suggests: “The accounting firm should consider making a noisy withdrawal, disassociating itself from the client, including by way of its own public statements, or, if that is not sufficient, informing the Commission.” Proof of Reserve Reports Surge Following FTX Collapse Following the crash of the crypto exchange FTX and the panic that ensued, several crypto firms published proof-of-reserve reports to assure customers that it has sufficient assets to meet customer liabilities. Crypto.com published its proof-of-reserve audit results by Mazars, revealing it maintains sufficient reserves. Indian crypto exchange WazirX followed suit and released its report, showing that 90% of its users’ assets are stored in Binance wallets. Auditing firm Mazars who was responsible for Binance, Crypto.com, KuCoin and several other crypto firms’ proof of reserve reports, announced it would pause all its business with crypto clients. The firm found Binance’s Bitcoin reserves to be overcollateralized but removed the report from its website. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Its potential is immense, as outlined in a recent report by digital payment network Ripple in collaboration with the United States Faster Payments Council (FPC). The report presents a robust case for blockchain’s role in expediting payment systems and the ensuing cost savings. But is the financial sector ready to embrace this emerging technology on a large scale? Related Reading: Ripple Attorney Withdraws From SEC Lawsuit, Will It Affect XRP? Financial Institutions To Embrace Faster Payment Systems With Blockchain The survey, which received inputs from 300 finance professionals spanning 45 countries, sheds light on the growing consensus about the advantages of blockchain. It illustrates a palpable shift in the perception of this technology across sectors including fintech, banking, retail, consumer technology, and media. Results show that global payments leaders are dissatisfied with legacy rails for cross-border payments. Learn why 97% believe #blockchain and #crypto will transform the way money moves in our latest whitepaper with @Faster_Payments. https://t.co/qacuAAzZrR pic.twitter.com/ForjM05Wbb — Ripple (@Ripple) July 28, 2023 The majority of the surveyed professionals, comprising analysts, directors, and CEOs, strongly assert the potential of blockchain. Approximately 97% are confident that blockchain technology will be instrumental in expediting payment processes over the upcoming three years This widely-held conviction underscores the positive outlook toward blockchain, indicating a readiness to welcome its disruptive capabilities. A Catalyst For Cost-Efficiency In Cross-Border Transactions? Furthermore, the report highlights the cost-saving potential of cryptocurrencies. More than half of the respondents agreed that cryptocurrencies could significantly reduce payment costs, both domestically and internationally. The report predicts that blockchain’s application in global transactions could save financial institutions an estimated $10 billion in cross-border payment costs by 2030, substantiated by findings from fintech analysis firm, Juniper Research. With the rapid growth of e-commerce and businesses looking to penetrate international markets, the report anticipates a surge in cross-border payments. It estimates global cross-border payment flows could reach roughly $156 trillion by 2030, buoyed by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%. Despite the optimistic views, the survey revealed a divide in opinions regarding the timeline for widespread merchant adoption of digital currency payments. About 50% of the respondents were optimistic about significant merchant adoption within the next three years. However, predictions varied for the likelihood of adoption within the next year, with the Middle East and African regions exhibiting the most confidence and Asia-Pacific the least. Related Reading: XRP Overtakes Bitcoin In Highest Weekly Trading Volume Following Legal Triumph Particularly, 27% of respondents from the Middle East and African regions anticipate that a majority of vendors will adopt cryptocurrency payments in the following year. While a mere 13% of the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region forecasted the same transition period. Regardless, over the past 24 hours, XRP has shown a slight uptrend up by 0.7% with a trading price of $0.71, at the time of writing.

15452071,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545033,1690719764,Maker (MKR) Signals Bullish Price Formation – Is $1.300 Around The Corner?,"Maker (MKR), one of the prominent players in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, has experienced a remarkable 11% price surge in the past seven days. Despite a slight drop in the last hour, the token’s performance remains impressive. Maker (MKR) Bullish Price Sentiment Maker’s recent price performance has been noteworthy, with a solid 11% increase over the past week. The token also recorded a 4.21% price increase in the last 24 hours, indicating strong momentum in the short term. However, a minor correction of 0.81% in the past hour highlights the market’s volatility. Currently trading at $1,220.43 per MKR, the token remains 80.75% below its all-time high of $6,339.02. While the recent price surge is encouraging, it is essential to consider the historical context and the factors influencing the crypto market’s dynamics. The MakerDAO community recently voted in favor of a temporary increase to the interest rate paid to holders of the protocol’s decentralized stablecoin, DAI. This proposal introduced the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate (EDSR), a mechanism to temporarily boost the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) to users during periods of low utilization. Proposed by Maker founder Rune Christensen, the EDSR could increase the effective DSR to 8% when the utilization ranges from 0% to 20%. The mechanism is designed to decrease the DSR as utilization increases gradually. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Reclaims 14th Spot In Market After 5% Jump This isn’t the first time Maker has adjusted the DSR. In the past few months, the protocol has raised the DSR thrice: first to 1% in November, then to 3.3% in May, and finally incorporating a marginal increase to 3.49% in June. The latest EDSR proposal aims to incentivize DAI holders and stimulate demand for the stablecoin. Stimulating Demand For DAI Despite the recent increase in the DSR, data from Dai Stats shows that investors have only deposited $307 million in the DSR, representing a modest 6.7% of the total supply of DAI. The amount of DAI in circulation decreased to $4.6 billion from over $6.9 billion in the previous year. In response to the declining circulation of Maker’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, the protocol is taking proactive steps to spur demand for DAI. By enhancing the interest rate DAI holders can earn, the protocol aims to attract more users and create a favorable ecosystem for DAI utilization. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) Market Cap Reaches New Peak, Edges Toward $84 Billion Mark The broader stablecoin market has also experienced a downtrend, with the total market capitalization sinking to $127 billion from nearly $160 billion a year ago. The introduction of EDSR is seen as a strategic move to increase the appeal of DAI and strengthen its position in the competitive stablecoin landscape. What’s Next For Maker (MKR)? As Maker continues improving the DAI ecosystem, investors closely monitor its governance decisions and the market’s response to the enhanced interest rate mechanism. The success of the EDSR proposal could drive further adoption of DAI and contribute to its overall liquidity in the market. Moreover, the broader crypto market’s performance and regulatory developments will determine Maker’s future trajectory. If the bullish sentiments continue, Maker could surpass the $1,300 resistance point but if the opposite occurs the next support levels are $1,200 and $1,180.

Shibarium, a Layer-2 network built on the Ethereum blockchain, brings the promise of increased interoperability to the SHIB community. Testing Phase Begins The Shibarium-to-Ethereum bridge now supports the transfer of test tokens between the twwo networks. A notable development in the SHIB ecosystem, this paves the way for broader utility and functionalities for Shiba Inu enthusiasts. With this development, doge-themed tokens, including Shiba Inu (SHIB) and ShibaSwap (BONE), have seen significant gains. SHIB, ranking 15th by market cap, reported an almost 6% surge, making it one of the top performers among the biggest cryptocurrencies. Aggregated blockchain data reveals that BONE has rallied by 9% over the past 24 hours, highlighting the positive market sentiment surrounding these developments. Impact on SHIB and Doge-Themed Tokens Shibarium emerges as a transformative evolution of the Shiba Ecosystem, serving as a powerful Layer 2 (L2) blockchain running on top of the Ethereum network. It aims to resolve common barriers in mainstream blockchain adoption, specifically transaction cost and speed. Its robust framework and ability to facilitate faster, cheaper, and off-chain transactions positions it as a promising solution for various industries, including the metaverdse, Web3 innovations, and gaming. Bolstering the SHIB ecosystem, Shibarium allows for the creation of chain-specific Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and supports the development of decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple domains. Additionally, $BONE, Shibarium's native token, plays a crucial role in gas transactions and rewards for Validators and Delegators, marking a significant step in the protocol's governance and functionality. The development of Shibarium paves the way for scalability, accessibility, and innovation within the DeFi landscape. Cybersecurity Concerns Amid Enthusiasm Despite the excitement, it's essential to remember that bridges have been a common target for cybercriminals. A stark reminder is the $622 million hack of the Ronin Network, an Ethereum sidechain used by Axie Infinity, in 2022. Notably, North Korean hackers were associated with this exploit, among others. Despite the risks, the testing of the Shibarium-Ethereum bridge could significantly enhance the Shiba Inu ecosystem's utility. As this layer-2 network develops, it could steer the project away from its ""meme coin"" label, positioning it as a token with tangible utility. However, as Shibarium advances, it remains to be seen whether associated tokens can match the dizzying highs of the last bull market. Both BONE and SHIB continue to hover at about 90% below their 2021 all-time highs. In recent weeks, there's been a resurgence of interest in dog-themed tokens. Dogecoin, the progenitor of this category, also experienced positive performance during this period. Speculations continue that Elon Musk could integrate this altcoin as an official payment method on X, previously known as Twitter. Musk's previous endorsements have been instrumental in the soaring values of dog-themed tokens, contributing to Dogecoin's monumental 14,700% surge in early 2021.

The crypto community has taken note of Musk’s recent acts since they continue to demonstrate his influence in altering the market dynamics of digital currency. The billionaire Musk, who is also the owner of the X app (formerly known as Twitter), posted on Sunday that “something special is coming soon.” Related Reading: CryptoPunks Toughness Tested As NFT Succumbs To 60% Drop In 1 Week Elon Musk Tweet Does It Again This tweet received a lot of positive feedback from the cryptocurrency community, especially from accounts with a Dogecoin theme. Something special coming soon — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 29, 2023 Based on Musk’s repeated references to this development in the past, many people, including the influencer David Gokhstein, anticipate that X will add DOGE – the largest meme coin – as a payment option. This anticipation arises from the fact that Elon Musk has previously made a number of very quiet signals that a similar action may be planned. Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a stunning price increase on Friday, garnering a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency community. On that particular day, DOGE’s price noticedably increased by over 10%, breaking past the $0.07 barrier mark. Dogecoin Rising At $0.08 When this article was being written, DOGE was trading at $0.08, up 2.7% over the previous day. However, the meme coin really proved its worth on a weekly basis, rising in value by about 13% in response to Musk’s post. Source: Coingecko This positive momentum-driven upward rise in value led to a sizable increase in the market capitalisation of the asset. The cryptocurrency’s market cap increased as a result, rising by an estimated $1 billion to a new high of $10.66 billion from its previous value of $9.67 billion. Related Reading: Traders’ Interest In XRP Remains Solid Despite Price Retreat, Data Shows The reasons for this remarkable rise have been the subject of heated speculation among many members of the crypto community. One of the more intriguing current theories is on the potential integration of DOGE, the disputed cryptocurrency, into the source code of Tesla’s website’s payment page. DOGE market cap currently at $11.8 billion on the weekly chart: TradingView.com Price Boom Soon? As enthusiasts and investors alike anticipate the potential effects of such a development, this notion has been spreading. The mere possibility of DOGE becoming a payment option for Tesla has sparked curiosity and led to upbeat predictions for the cryptocurrency’s future. If Elon Musk does truly integrate DOGE payments into his X app, Dogecoin will experience a solid increase in utility and acceptance, as well as a significant price boom.

The crypto firm had also been recently under the eye of UK's data watchdogs, a few weeks after it disclosed collaboration with Auth0 in Berlin. Worldcoin's Approach to User Identity: A Double-Edged Sword? Worldcoin, which boasts 2.1 million users predominantly from a two-year trial period, operates a global network of 'orbs,' shiny spherical devices capable of scanning users' irises. Despite this novel approach to establishing user identity, or ""proof of personhood,"" the project's method has been perceived as questionable, leading to an investigation by Britain's data regulator this week. CNIL, in response to a Reuters query on Worldcoin, stated that ""The legality of this collection seems questionable, as do the conditions for storing biometric data."" Further, CNIL's investigations indicated that jurisdiction over the project lies with the Bavarian state authority in Germany, now conducting the investigation with CNIL's support. Worldcoin Foundation's Stance on Privacy Concerns In response to these legal concerns, the Worldcoin Foundation, a Cayman Islands-based entity and self-proclaimed ""steward of the Worldcoin protocol,"" maintains that its project is designed to protect individual privacy. The foundation also claims to have built a robust privacy program and is committed to meeting regulatory requirements. ""The Worldcoin Foundation complies with all laws and regulations governing the processing of personal data in the markets where Worldcoin is available,"" the foundation said in an email. Notably, the regulator sspecified that the project is supervised in the European Union by the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision and will continue to cooperate with governing bodies on requests for more information about its privacy and data protection practices.
