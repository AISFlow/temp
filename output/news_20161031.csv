42378934,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mUFx,1477944565,Banks Trial Blockchain With South African Regulators,"A group of South African banks have pushed ahead with plans to test blockchain applications in a partnership that has drawn support from key regulators in the country.  As reported by local outlets IT Web and MoneyWeb, the project included teams from Standard Chartered, Absa, Rand Merchant Bank, Investec and Nedbank. Supporters of the initiative included the Financial Services Board, a major finance regulator; Strate, the country’s central securities depository; and the South African Reserve Bank.  The institutions involved developed and tested a system for issuing syndicated loans via blockchain. According to MoneyWeb, the trial involved the South African central bank circulating a smart contract to other parties on the test network.  The collaboration between South African banks and financial regulators grew out of efforts that began in earnest earlier this year, when as many as 60 representatives from South African banks started collaborating on applications. It was around that time that Absa announced that it was joining the R3 blockchain consortium.  According to those involved, the efforts are early but promising.  Farzam Ehsani, who manages Rand Merchant Bank’s internal blockchain efforts, told MoneyWeb:  “As we are in a mode of learning, we will definitely consider other platforms as the entire blockchain industry is nascent and new platforms are emerging.”  Arif Ismail of the South African Reserve Bank told IT Web that regulators need to pursue close-up involvement in an environment of rapid technological change.  ""Everyone wants to get their hands on what's going on with blockchains and distributed ledgers. And some of the concepts are not that simple. So, from a regulator's perspective, it's imperative that we keep close to what's going on.""

42378930,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mU9f,1477935997,Australian Regulator: Blockchain Acquisitions Could Face Scrutiny,"Australia's biggest banks might need approval for any future blockchain acquisitions, according to a key business regulator in the country.  Speaking with Reuters, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims remarked that as domestic banks pursue opportunities in fintech including blockchain, it might spark the need for more active oversight from regulators like his agency. More specifically, the ACCC might have to get involved if major banks start buying up startups that might otherwise compete with them or other institutions.  The comments come as Australia looks to reshape its regulatory approach to fintech, with an eye on how to regulate bitcoin exchange activity in the country. Australia released a broad fintech policy outline earlier this year, calling for cooperation between private and public sector bodies as well as participation across various agencies within the government.  For now, according to Sims, the ACCC is in a wait-and-see position that could be subject to change should fintech becomes more prevalent. In the event of any proposed startup acquisitions related to the tech, the ACCC might move in to take a closer look.  He told Reuters:  ""I think we need to, as an organisation, take a really close look at these things. This means making a forward-looking judgment. Will these things be disruptive in the future? They may be small now. What can they unlock in the future?""  If the ACCC is prompted to act, it wouldn't be the first time that the agency has stepped into an imbroglio involving the technology.  Last year, the ACCC waded into a dispute between Australian banks and bitcoin startups working in the country. In February, the agency declared that banks didn’t conspire against the startups, announcing that it would not open a full investigation into the matter.

42378918,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mU0r,1477932228,Cryptsy Class Action to Settle With Ex-Wife of Troubled CEO,"The plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit filed after the collapse of Florida digital currency exchange Cryptsy are moving to settle with one of its defendants.  Lorie Ann Nettles, the former spouse of Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon, was named as a co-defendant in the class action, which was initiated in January. The lawsuit was filed after the now-defunct exchange claimed that it had been hacked two years prior, leaving it with millions of dollars in customer liabilities.  Cryptsy’s collapse followed months of growing problems with customer withdrawals. Vernon later claimed that the exchange's insolvency was hidden in order to prevent panic among users.  Nettles’ role in the dispute stems largely from a divorce settlement agreement between her and Vernon, which included a home in Palm Beach County, Florida, valued at more than $1m. That property, along with other assets including a diamond ring and a motor vehicle, are set to be sold for the benefit of class action members, filings reveal.  An attorney for Nettles was not immediately available for comment.  Plaintiffs claimed in the suit that the assets were purchased using monies taken from Cryptsy users. Though Nettles pushed back against the allegations at first, the two sides ultimately entered mediation, resulting in the agreement currently before the court.  If approved, the settlement would mark the beginning of what could become a longer, more protracted process.  Vernon, who has blasted the class action lawsuit and the legal team behind it, is believed to be residing in China. According to the plaintiffs, his location and lack of official response to the suit complicates the process moving forward.  They argued in the latest filing:  “As a result, even though a Default has been entered against Vernon, recovering any relief from him will likely require extensive, costly and time-consuming post-judgment litigation to locate and secure assets, even assuming such assets could ever be located, seized and converted into US dollars.”  Other assets set to be sold in the event of a finalized settlement include cryptocurrency holdings currently under the control of court-appointed receiver James Sallah, as well as additional “personal property” accrued during the process.  Of the amount collected, an unspecified amount will be given to Nettles to “provide basic living necessities for herself and her children”.

42378926,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mU8P,1477927239,Bitcoin Update Brings Scaling Solution Closer to Activation,"An update to the bitcoin software that features code that could potentially activate a long-anticipated scaling solution has been released.  Issued on Thursday and dedicated solely to code called Segregated Witness (SegWit), version 0.13.1 allows miners to signal support for the scaling solution after 15th November. If activated, the code also instructs nodes on how to validate the new type of transactions that will result from the patch. (SegWit boosts the bitcoin block size by a factor of about 1.8x by moving transaction signatures to another data structure).  But there are still a series of steps left before the software will be triggered through a process known as a soft fork.  For one, the update requires near-universal support from miners. The code will be 'locked-in' once 95% of a series of 2,016 blocks (roughly two weeks worth of blocks) are broadcast by those running the new code. Next, wallet holders will need to make changes if they want to take advantage of the update.  However, despite high expectations, it's unclear whether SegWit will reach the 95% threshold.  Mining pool ViaBTC has been particularly outspoken about its support for alternative scaling proposals, arguing that bigger blocks should still be considered as a scaling mechanism. However, the pool (which makes up roughly 5% of bitcoin’s mining power) has seen its support dwindle, perhaps as a result of its controversial stance.  If triggered, code change also paves the way for other updates, including the Lightning Network (another proposed scaling solution), and easier future soft forks. Other potential benefits are detailed on the Bitcoin Core website.  But while there are a still a few steps to go (and a few signs of division among supporters), Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell has been optimistic.  In a recent reddit post, Maxwell indicated that he believes the code could be ""active by Christmas"".

42378935,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mUDR,1477922485,Credit Card Giant MasterCard Releases 'Experimental' Blockchain APIs,"Visa isn't the only credit card issuer moving fast on blockchain.  But while Visa is going it alone in releasing a B2B blockchain, MasterCard it seems is quietly developing a set of new blockchain APIs with more collaborative goals.  The credit card giant’s development site now features three APIs connected to its internal blockchain work, including offerings focused on smart contracts and payment settlement. The APIs were released by MasterCard Labs, its innovation outfit.  MasterCard blockchain lead Justin Pinkham said the company released its API platform last month in a bid to stoke interest among banks and merchant developers.  He told CoinDesk:  ""This is part of our initiative to publish experimental APIs from Mastercard Labs and give developers the chance to work on emerging technologies that haven't yet been commercialized by us.""  Pinkham went on to state that the company is continuing to pursue uses of the technology while at the same time advocating for collaborations that might apply to MasterCard's businesses.  ""We believe that there is a role of blockchain in the future of commerce. This future needs to be developed in partnership with banks, merchants and industry participants,"" he continued.  The news is perhaps the most significant to date for MasterCard, which has criticized bitcoin (the longest-running public blockchain) in the past but expressed cautious enthusiasm about its underlying technology.  More in store  But with the launch of the APIs, MasterCard is beginning to push some of the work done by its internal teams out the door.  It won’t be the last, according to Pinkham, who said that the company is creating the foundation for blockchain tech that could focus on use cases including inter-bank payments and trade finance.  Applications focused on digital identity and the exchange of know-your-customer information are also being explored, according to Pinkham.  The work coincides with collaborative efforts between MasterCard and startups through its Start Path Global program, as well as the more than 30 blockchain-related patents Pinkham said the company has submitted to date.

42378940,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mUMF,1477918558,"For Blockchain Startups, Switzerland's 'Crypto Valley' is No New York","A tiny province in Switzerland is proving such a magnet for blockchain startups that it's increasingly being compared to California's famed Silicon Valley.  The 30-kilometer stretch of land from Zurich to Zug, known as 'Crypto Valley', boasts progressive laws, a competitive hiring environment and low taxes, and it's this unique mix that has attracted entrepreneurs looking for a place to gain traction amid an uncertain international legal climate.  While governments in the US, China and Russia have all taken strict or uncertain regulatory positions toward digital currencies, Switzerland has largely continued the laissez-faire philosophy that has long made its banks valuable (even if controversially so), and 'Crypto Valley' has become the center of the movement.  The confluence of blockchain projects and startups (which now includes the Ethereum Foundation, Shapeshift and Xapo), while no utopia, is best considered a promising work in progress that finds local governments, national authorities and startups seeking to advance technology that has struggled to find a global foothold.  One organization that has taken up the mantle is the Greater Zurich Areahttp://www.greaterzuricharea.com/ economic region, a public-private partnership that has helped more traditional tech companies like Google and Uber set up shop in Zurich.  Executive director of investment Lukas Sieber explained that he believes Switzerland is primed to become a global center blockchain disruptors.  Sieber told CoinDesk:  ""Switzerland is the most decentralized government in the world and this is attractive to people who work with the most decentralized technology. The decentralized aspect of Zug and Zurich guarantees stability for them.""  With apparent government support and legal innovations, Sieber argued Crypto Valley is proving a stark contrast to jurisdictions abroad.  If you name it…  But even decentralized movements have to start somewhere.  Indeed, the idea for Crypto Valley goes back to January 2014, when Johann Gevers, founder and CEO of of blockchain transaction platform Monetas, first started laying the groundwork to create a global hub for blockchain firms.  During a meeting with representatives of the ethereum project, Monetas and Zug's economic promotion office, ethereum co-founder Mihai Alisie is said to have the coined the name ""Crypto Valley"". By April of that year, Gevers had announced the initiative at the Toronto Bitcoin Expo.  ""The name and concept took off like fire, and the vision is well on its way to being realized,"" Gevers explained in an investor document provided to CoinDesk.  Among the reasons Gevers lists for the region's attractiveness include a ""stable predictable, neutral political system""; a culture of financial privacy; access to talent; low taxes; public-private supporthttp://www.s-ge.com/en for entrepreneurs; and the World Economic Forum's listing of Switzerland as the most competitive nation in the world.  In October 2013, Gever founded the Bitcoin Association of Switzerland, and the following May, he started the Digital Finance Compliance Association. Now, other startups and projects are taking note.  By the latest count, 18 companies are listed in one collection of Crypto Valley startups, along with two meetups that total over 2,000 members.  Fits and starts  To some, this momentum may be a side effect of Switzerland's progressive governance structure.  According to Sieber, the fundamental advantage Switzerland's political system offers is that every citizen has the right to propose a change to a law.  Called direct democracy, this distributed form of governance gives each of 26 regions (or cantons) and even smaller municipalities a high degree of control over their own laws. Already this has an impact on boosting momentum for blockchain.  In June, two members of the Swiss Parliament's Federal Assembly proposed a total of three blockchain-related motions designed to make it easier for the financial sector to anticipate ramifications of blockchain technologies; ""consolidate"" Switzerland’s position as a blockchain leader; and make it easier for blockchain startups to hold customer funds without being classified as banks.  The move was largely heralded in the media as a sign of Switzerland's progressive ways, and lauded a victory for blockchain startups everywhere.  Then, three months later, all three motions were abruptly rejected.  Though it is still unclear as to why the measures were shot down, a representative of Switerland’s Federal Assembly confirmed: ""The National Council has not passed it – the issue is closed. (Liquidé).""  Zug's bitcoin experiment  But thanks to Switzerland's federated structure, a bitcoin experiment first unveiled earlier this year in the canton of Zug continues to gain traction.  Announced in May, the program lets citizens pay for government services of up to 200 Swiss francs with bitcoin. As of 27th October, the government-supported bitcoin payment program had been used for a total of 39 transactions.  The chief administrator of Zug's local government, Martin Würmli, told CoinDesk that only nine of those transactions came from ""customers"" and that the remainder likely came from journalists testing the service.  But Würmli added that the local government is ""happy"" with the results and will conduct a full evaluation in December of this year.  He concluded:  ""Everything works and we have good feedback.""  It seems other local service providers see value in bitcoin as well, with Swiss railway service SBB announcing last week it will soon accept the payment method.  A new model  But perhaps no project symbolizes the future Zug more than SingularDTC, a decentralized media company that is setting out to build a Netflix-like streaming video service using the ethereum blockchain.  Citing Crypto Valley’s ""very large accumulation of talent"" and its crypto-friendly government policies, the startup’s CFO Arie Levy-Cohen told CoinDesk his team began working with the Greater Zurich Area's Lukas Sieber earlier this year in an attempt to open an office in the region.  But rather than simply set up shop and carry on, Singular DTV went so far as to launch an alternative business model that allows it to issue units of blockchain-based code (sometimes known as an 'initial coin offering' due to its similarities with a public issuance) to users in an attempt to incentivize early adopters.  Called a Centrally Organized Distributed Entity (CODE), the concept was developed in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation; Zug-based law firm MME; and ConsenSys, an ethereum startup hub. Intended to protect token holders and issuers from liability, it also could form the foundation of future startup infrastructures.    Designed to be a regulatory and tax-compliant bridge between the legacy business world and the decentralized structure enabled by ethereum, MME partner and member of the Zug Bar Association, Luka Müller-Studer said his team has 12 projects using the CODE model ""in the pipeline"" and waiting to register.        ""We are not only focusing on compliant ICO structures,"" said Müller-Studer. ""But also on the efficient subsequent execution of the business rational behind the smart contract systems""    SingularDTV’s co-founder and CEO Zach LeBeau told CoinDesk he believes that the next great tech boom will see ""trillions and trillions of centralized dollars"" move to a blockchain, and that CODE will help make that happen.  LeBeau concluded:  ""Switzerland is the most decentralized country in the world. It’s really quite exciting to see a country, a city, operating in a decentralized manner.""

42378938,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mUHD,1477914380,3 Reasons Hyperledger Has Blockchain's Best Development Model,"Zaki Manian is the founder of Skuchain, a startup seeking to bring cryptographic trust to the supply chain.  In this opinion piece, Manian argues that Hyperledger offers the best development model for the permissioned blockchain industry, and that attempts to use public networks for business-to-business use cases are perhaps misguided.  The nascent business-to-business permissioned ledger industry is moving rapidly from pilots to real product development and deployment.  But as this novel application space opens up, it is important for technologists to start answering hard questions about what software development processes will provide the blockchain layer of these applications stacks.  The permissioned ledger industry proposes to build a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for the finance industry and general purpose Internet security. However, the dominant development model in our industry thus far (capital-strapped startups leveraging public ledger technology for permissioned ledger applications) is insufficient for the task.  This approach comes with several drawbacks.  For one, the technical considerations for creating and operating a permissioned ledger network are largely antithetical to the needs of public networks. While the industry can expect continued cross-pollination between enterprise and cryptocurrency applications, it belies the genuine engineering work that needs to be done when we rely too heavily on software artifacts from cryptocurrencies.  Some parts of the blockchain ecosystem have been tackling the problem of blockchain infrastructure head on, and have made considerable investment in providing solutions to the technical challenges.  Given the scope of the engineering investment involved, it isn't surprising that most of these efforts are proprietary codebases that become part of the value proposition of the startup to their customers. (As an early mover in the permissioned ledger space, Skuchain began by customizing bitcoin's Go implementation for proofs of concept).  But to capture the value of a blockchain, customers fundamentally need the ability to operate and control their software independently, and this is only possible by delivering solutions on top of an ecosystem rather than a bespoke code base.  My company Skuchain has long viewed its proprietary ledger as a bridge to the day when an ecosystem has emerged. We feel that day has come.  Three virtues  Blockchains are an enabling infrastructure technology where most of the value creation occurs at higher levels of the application stack.  The incentives in the technology businesses are largely to neglect infrastructure (most of the time) to provide the desired user experiences. But niche technology stacks are not the resilient technology that the world needs for critical systems.  In our judgement, Hyperledger has three virtues as a home for enterprise ledger technology: architecture, organizational structure and development in the open.  Perhaps the most important thing to get right at this early movement in the adoption of blockchain technology is the basic technical architecture. It has proven phenomenally difficult to start out with a monolithic architecture and try to construct reasonably componentized architecture.  Hyperledger's Fabric reflects that we are in the early stages of figuring out what the best answers are for peer-to-peer enterprise application design, adversary tolerant atomic broadcast and blockchain architecture.  Hyperledger's organizational structure elevates and incentivizes infrastructure work.  Our view is that the participants in Hyperledger at the Linux Foundation have decades of experience trying to pick apart the puzzle of how to incentivize and sustain collaborative core infrastructure work among businesses with a variety of competitive and aligned interests in the marketplace.  Role for open development  As observers in the steering process, we've watched how an aligned set of incentives play themselves out in positive directions.  At Skuchain, we see a responsibility to contribute back to this community on multiple levels technically in terms of code and design work, in terms of evangelism and, eventually, as we build a sustainable business on top of Hyperledger, financially through membership.  Finally, while ""many eyes make all bugs shallow"" is neither adequate nor sufficient for robust security oriented development process, high-quality processes exist in both open- and closed-source development.  At this stage, Hyperledger's core teams have been tremendously willing to balance the needs to get important milestones with an open and transparent development process. It gives us incredible confidence to see meaningful progress in the upstream commits, real work happening in the issue tracker and the second-version architecture coming along.  We anticipate that a robust infrastructure of service providers and middleware analytics and other players will be necessary for the blockchain application stack and the open development process should play a role in coordinating and accelerating that growth in a way that closed system cannot.  It's far too early to proclaim any sort of winner in the development of a blockchain stack. But Skuchain believes that Hyperledger is defining the right kinds of structure for the blockchain industry to avoid the pitfalls that might limit its potential.
