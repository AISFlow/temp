16284697,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/could-ripple-next-big-move-result-in-decoupling-from-bitcoin,1560115800,Could Ripple (XRP)’s Next Big Move Result In Decoupling From Bitcoin?,"Ripple (XRP) is a lot different than most cryptocurrencies for a number of reasons. First of all, it does not use blockchain technology. Instead, it uses distributed consensus ledger using a network of validating servers. Second of all, Bitcoin (BTC) is supposed to be digital gold and a store of value while Ripple (XRP) is just a digital currency aimed at making payments faster and cheaper. It is quite obvious that both of them actually have quite little in common apart from both being called cryptocurrencies. Now, this decoupling debate is not new. We have seen it come under discussion many a time in the past especially around times when Ripple (XRP) was likely to make a big move against Bitcoin (BTC). While most cryptocurrencies have also topped out against Bitcoin (BTC) just as they have against the US Dollar (USD), the same cannot be said of Ripple (XRP). The weekly chart for XRP/BTC shows that Ripple (XRP) still has plenty of room to rally against Bitcoin (BTC). The MFI indicator has recently flashed a buy signal which is another positive sign for Ripple (XRP). However, investors need to be cautious as we have seen Ripple (XRP) decline against Bitcoin (BTC) despite being massively oversold in the past. That being said, if Ripple (XRP) were to decouple from Bitcoin (BTC), this would be one of the best times to expect it. Apart from technical and fundamental differences with Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, the Ripple (XRP) community is also a lot different. Most Ripple (XRP) enthusiasts consider Bitcoin (BTC) to be an old and outdated cryptocurrency that will eventually be replaced by Ripple (XRP) as the faster and cheaper way to send and receive money. Ripple (XRP) is on the verge of a big move against the US Dollar (USD). Considering that the price is near oversold territory on the 1H time frame for XRP/USD, we expect the price to continue rallying from here regardless of which way it breaks out. The Money Flow Index also supports our view that XRP/USD still has plenty of room to rally. Thailand’s largest commercial bank recently tweeted about using Ripple (XRP) but it retracted its tweet soon afterwards. Ripple (XRP) has also been flooding the market with its XRP supply lately. It is hard to say yet how that has affected the price but it is reasonable to say that Ripple (XRP)’s price is more controlled than many other cryptocurrencies. For those looking for stability like big banks or financial institutions this might eventually be a good thing. However, for those looking for consistent growth, it may not be good news. Ripple (XRP) has a history of making most of its gains in a short, unexpected time frame. This is why most Ripple (XRP) investors are hodlers who hold their coins in anticipation of that next big move. While Ripple is a wonderful company, it should be clear to investors that investing in Ripple (the company) and XRP (the token) is not the same thing.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/could-ripple-next-big-move-result-in-decoupling-from-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284697.jpeg

16284696,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/ethereum-weekly-close-above-50-ema-be-very-bullish-short-term,1560112200,Ethereum (ETH) Weekly Close Above 50 EMA Would Be Very Bullish Short Term,"Ethereum (ETH) is finally closing a week in red after months of uptrend, but this may not be as bearish as it looks. In fact, it ETH/USD ends up closing the weekly candle above the 50 week EMA, that would be a very bullish development, one that might pave the way for a rally past $300 in the weeks ahead. Ethereum (ETH) was primed for a major decline but it stalled that decline by cooling off short term to make way for another rally to the upside. The price can keep on consolidating and rising in this manner for a long time which is why the RSI may not be a good indicator of predicting price action. This is because the RSI is derived from the price action and not vice versa which means that price action is the most valuable data we have. Looking at the price action for ETH/USD, we see that it formed a higher high and higher low between April and now. If Ethereum (ETH) begins next week in green, we have every reason to believe that the price could end up rallying towards $300 or higher levels. That being said, we should be very careful going long on ETH/USD at this point because the price could break below this rising wedge any time now. It should not be forgotten that Ethereum (ETH) is still due for another downtrend and that the price of Ethereum (ETH) has yet to find its true bottom. We have seen the market inflict maximum pain on the bears in a way that surprised even most retail bulls. However, they have also become complacent now while the bears have become very cautious. Interestingly, we are at a turning point in this market as the bears are about to see their good days begin again because this bear market is far from over yet. The daily chart for ETHUSDShorts shows that the number of margined shorts declined significantly in the past few months but the time has come for a trend reversal. The bears attempted to force a new downtrend in April but they failed miserably. However, this time ETHUSDShorts has reached the end of the line trading within a large descending wedge. Soon as ETHUSDShorts breaks the trend line resistance and breaks out of the large falling wedge, we will see bearish pressure mount up and the price of Ethereum (ETH) will take a hit. However, before that happens, we can see the number of margined shorts decline further for the next few weeks. The big picture remains intact. Ethereum (ETH) might be bullish short term but it is due for a major move to the downside long term. The market has inflicted maximum pain on the bears but we are unlikely to see another bullish cycle before the market inflicts maximum pain on the bulls. There are still a lot of people waiting for Ethereum (ETH) to rocket to the moon from here. The market will give them reasons to believe that until it crushes their dreams and leaves them dejected and heartbroken. That is when we will see the new bullish cycle begin.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/ethereum-weekly-close-above-50-ema-be-very-bullish-short-term,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284696.jpeg

42382071,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qYWx,1560072623,The Speed Dreams of Security Tokens,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of CoinDesk’s product team. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in cryptoassets, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.      In nature, fast is better than slow. Being able to outrun your predator increases your chances of survival, as does being able to outrun your prey. So, evolution does its thing and we emerge hardwired into believing that speed is a prerequisite to success.  This sentiment has spilled over into financial markets. Speed is associated with competitive advantage and additional profits. Just ask any high-frequency trader.  It also reared its head at a recent security token event in London, a small but compelling gathering with entrepreneurs, investors and traditional finance representatives debating what form this new type of asset will take.  One of the exercises was to split participants up into groups and rank the supposed benefits of security tokens. We were given a list of outcomes to choose from, which included liquidity, operational efficiency, transparency, innovation and many others. The lack of a clear consensus was unsurprising, given the diversity of the participants (much like the sector itself). What was surprising, however, was the number that insisted the main benefit was “speed.”  This was surprising, as it is based on three assumptions:  1) That speed is desirable  2) That blockchains confer speed  3) That it is a technology issue.  All of these assumptions, however, are mistaken.  Speed is not a priority  First, let’s look at why we think faster transactions would be desirable.  The main reason is risk reduction. The longer a trade takes to settle, the greater the risk that the buyer will default on its payment commitment. In capital markets, things can happen fast, and an investor who wanted to purchase an asset on Tuesday could be out of funds (or hacked, or have its accounts frozen) by Wednesday.  Traditional markets usually get around this problem with a Central Clearing Party (CCP), which steps in to buy and sell from each participant in the trade in its own name and with its own funds. Yet this adds costs and middlemen to the system, and there is still the (remote) risk that the CCP will disappear, leaving trades half complete.  Security token markets do not yet have a CCP figure. Maybe one will emerge as the market matures, adding further liquidity and reliability. Meanwhile, in crypto assets, lack of a fast trade cycle adds risk.  Faster transactions would also be desirable, in theory, because cash could be used more efficiently -- but this is only partially true. If I am the seller and you are the buyer, I would like the cash sooner rather than later, thank you. The sooner I can invest it for a return or use it to meet payments, the better. You, on the other hand, would rather give it to me later, since you probably have it parked somewhere earning interest. Or, maybe you need to sell an asset to raise the cash that you need to give to me.  For the instant settlement that blockchain tech promises, you would need to have funds deposited at the relevant exchange or broker. Even if you do get a return on that (a big “if”), it will be much lower than you could get elsewhere. And if you’re managing money on behalf of others, that’s unlikely to be acceptable.  And, what if I am the owner of the asset, but don’t actually have it on me? Maybe I’ve lent it out to a short-seller or used it for collateral. It might take me a bit of time to unwind that commitment to be able to transfer it to you. The requirement to have it on hand for immediate settlement could curb the growth of lending and collateralization, which would preclude the emergence of a sophisticated market.  To highlight the point, a few years ago the Moscow stock exchange moved from same-day to two-day settlement, in what was touted as a “modernization.”  So, speed in settlement may reduce risk, but it adds a degree of inefficiency.  Blockchains are not fast  Now let’s look at the misconception that a blockchain-based transaction would be faster than one on traditional rails.  Blockchains are much slower than centralized databases. The technology involves validation of a transfer by the entire network, and, depending on the relevant blockchain’s consensus algorithm, could take somewhere between a few seconds and some minutes.  Even private blockchains, which do not have the same consensus considerations, have some degree of latency.  On the other hand, trades on traditional markets take nanoseconds.  Settlement is not faster, either. Last week the Bundesbank released the results of a series of trials it performed with Deutsche Borse which tested blockchain technology vs traditional rails in financial settlement. The blockchain-based system lost in terms of speed and cost.  Technology is not the problem  But, of course, blockchain-based settlement must be faster than traditional settlement - blockchain cuts out middlemen, right? Fewer steps should mean faster transfers of assets and payment.  Perhaps, but the number of steps and middlemen is not a technology issue. It’s about processes, and they evolve over time in response to problems and circumstances. Moving to a blockchain-based transfer and settlement system will not necessarily solve these problems. As we saw earlier, instant settlement is not always desirable.  So, expecting a new type of asset to “solve” a problem that isn’t really there, with technology that isn’t faster, is placing unrealistic expectations on an emerging concept.  And unrealistic expectations will not help these new assets find their market.  What is needed?  What that market will look like is still unclear. What is clear is the sector’s rapid evolution and its potential to help reform capital markets through the spread of blockchain-based assets and settlement.  For that to materialize, however, several things need to happen:  Standards need to be adopted across the sector to ensure interoperability and the smooth transfer of assets and funds.  Regulation and/or oversight needs to be crafted to prevent fraud and a dangerous build-up of risk.  Stablecoin markets need to evolve to enable immediate payment without having to rely on fiat transfers.  And smart contracts need to develop to ensure the reliable transfer of ownership and rights.  All of the above is likely, but even once in place, there is no guarantee that security tokens will trade and settle faster than traditional assets.  Unlike in nature, the evolution of financial markets has shown us that speed is not always in our interests.  In finance, efficiency and resilience are more important than “winning"" – just ask the tortoise and the hare.
