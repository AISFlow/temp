37830,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=237084,1653607850,Top Venture Capital Firms Supporting Upcoming Crypto Projects,"A recent report suggests that venture capital firms made crypto investments worth $33B in 2021. The data shows that numerous investors are playing a pivotal role in the crypto/blockchain field. A venture capital majorly hosts a group of investors who hope to make returns from certain crypto projects. Simply put, venture capitalists act as financial contributors to start-ups. On the other hand, fund managers are solely responsible for proposing an investment opportunity to venture capitalists. VC Crypto Meaning In the context of cryptocurrencies, venture capital (VC) firms represent investors who provide financial support to upcoming crypto projects. Accumulating capital through retail investors can be difficult since it may delay a project&apos;s goals. Such challenges are making VC firms more popular as they track the most suitable projects. Fund managers may also spread their investments across various portfolios to minimize certain risks and the effects of price volatility. Top Crypto VC List The following section describes the leading VC firms taking over the digital asset economy. The companies include: Digital Currency Group Digital Currency Group functions as a New York-based firm established in 2015.

42420969,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcX6l8H,1653606040,Terra Devs Need a Home. Other Blockchains Are Courting Them,"Terra’s swift collapse triggered a crypto market sell-off, billions in lost fortunes and a rumored class-action lawsuit.  But now, Terra’s most valuable asset – the loyalty of their developers – is being challenged.  With the launch of Terra 2.0, projects must decide whether or not they will stay loyal to the Terra ecosystem or choose another path. Competing blockchains are offering up major perks for them to develop on greener pastures. Will they stay or will they go?  As Terra’s native LUNA token lost 99% of its value, other Terra project tokens got swept up in the sell-off, wiping nearly $40 billion in value from the once-robust Terra ecosystem. Indeed, Terra was more than UST.  “Terra projects are exploring different options,” said Dan Edlebeck, co-founder of Sei Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem. “They’re looking at what makes sense from an engineering perspective, and in some instances, letting their community decide.”  These developers are also facing poaching efforts from Terra’s competitors, with some blockchains even launching eight-figure funds to help sweeten the deal.  Dev poaching  Terra developer Neel Somani, 24, quit his job at hedge fund Citadel to build on Terra just one month before the UST depeg. It was notable enough for The New York Times to wax poetic on his misfortunes.  His project, Terranova, aimed to bring Ethereum-compatibility onto the Terra blockchain. Integrating Terra with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) could bring an influx of new projects into the Terra blockchain, the thinking went.  With his current project now “on pause,” Somani says he is facing uncertain next steps.  “A lot of ecosystems have reached out, including Avalanche, Secret Network and Osmosis,” Somani told CoinDesk.  Avalanche is an EVM-compatible blockchain that has previously collaborated with Terra. Secret Network, a privacy-focused blockchain, and Osmosis, with its focus on DeFi, are also based on Cosmos technology.  Somani said these projects typically send him a link to a grant application, along with a handful of ideas of what the network finds attractive. He has also received “a handful” of interview requests from various protocols.  “I haven’t committed to anything at this point,” Somani said.  DeFi talent  Dan Eskow, founder of Up Top, a recruiting firm specializing in crypto jobs, says developer talent has been in hot demand, especially for engineers with experience building on Terra.  “There aren’t many engineers who have been deep enough in DeFi to see a project scale to that level,” Eskow told CoinDesk.  Before its collapse, Terra’s UST reached $18 billion in market capitalization, and the Terra ecosystem ranked second in DeFi total valued locked (TVL), according to data from DeFiLlama.  “The engineers at Terra built a strong product,” said Eskow. “The failed strategy is not a reflection of their work, and there are many projects with less baggage that would hire them in a second.”  In short, the failure of a prominent algorithmic stablecoin also sunk the fortunes of other projects that had nothing to do with UST.  For the crypto industry, a chronic shortage of developers has left blockchain projects starving for quality talent.  “A strength of Terra was DeFi,” said Sei’s Edlebeck. “It wasn’t just Anchor. Terra had borrowing and lending, it had derivatives, it had a money market.”  Read more: Jae Kwon Returns to ‘NewTendermint’ to Battle for the Soul of Cosmos  Edlebeck says he would like to see a more “robust” ecosystem on Cosmos, adding that Sei Protocol has started working with an ex-Terra team to build out a perpetuals product.  “I do think that Cosmos and its design architecture is poised to see a lot of new activity take place,” said Edlebeck. Notably, Terra itself is built on Cosmos technology.  In addition to engineers, crypto recruiter Eskow says he’s also looking to poach talent from funds that suffered big losses from Terra, hoping that embattled employees choose to jump ship.  Kadena, Polygon launch Terra support funds  To further entice talent, blockchains projects such as Kadena and Polygon both announced this week that they would dedicate millions in funding to assist projects affected by the Terra turmoil – so long as the project agrees to build on their respective chains.  Kadena, a layer 1 blockchain founded in 2016, announced a $10 million Terra relief fund Thursday in an attempt to court projects into its ecosystem.  “We’re supportive of everyone that’s been affected by this mini meltdown,” said Francesco Melpignano, CEO of Kadena Eco, the growth arm of Kadena. “We don’t want to be dancing on people’s graves.”  Melpignano stressed that the funds will go beyond helping just Terra developers, even projects that, for example, lost runway capital by depositing funds into Anchor would qualify for assistance.  “This is a defining moment for the blockchain industry,” Melpignano told CoinDesk. “It goes beyond Terra.”  Polygon, an Ethereum sidechain, has also announced a multimillion-dollar fund to assist Terra projects looking to build in the Polygon ecosystem. The fund would allow developers to cover unforeseen costs of transferring their businesses away from Terra and onto Polygon.  “When we saw the unfortunate collapse of Terra, it left a lot of developers without a home,” said Polygon Studios CEO Ryan Watt. “Terra’s failure shouldn’t punish [the decentralized applications] built on it.”  Watt declined to comment on the specific size of the fund, in an effort to “ensure that developers aren’t feeling rushed to decide and give off the impression that there’s only a finite amount of money available.”  Additionally, he advised project teams to build where users are and to build to be EVM-compatible.  “The important emphasis here is that we are putting millions of dollars aside, whatever it may take, to properly ensure developers have a home to move to and continue building in Web 3,” Watt told CoinDesk.  Terra 2.0  Terra projects such as non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace RandomEarth, DeFi protocol Nebula and decentralized exchange Phoenix Finance have publicly announced their solidarity with Terra 2.0, with Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon retweeting the messages to his many followers.  However, representatives of a Terra project who spoke with CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity said that supporting the new chain was not exactly the same as committing to build on Terra.  “Terraform Labs was extremely good to us as developers, so we want to support them in launching the fork, but we can’t commit to building yet,” a Terra developer told CoinDesk. “The thinking is, there’s not any downside with aligning with Terra until things with the new chain become clearer.”  Sei Protocol’s Edlebeck says he’s been in close communications with several top Terra projects over the past few weeks, including the team from Delphi Labs, a heavy investor in the Terra ecosystem.  “Project founders are really exploring other options, even more than I was anticipating,” said Edlebeck. “Terra 2.0 has too much up in the air, the path forward is being questioned.”  Devs keep on BUIDLing  Despite the uncertainty over where to build next, Kadena’s Melpignano says he hopes developers don’t end up leaving the space altogether.  Web 3 talent retention was another motivating factor behind Kadena’s $10 million fund, Melpignano admits.  “Now is the best time to build,” said Melpignano. “This is when the category-defining apps will be born.”  Even for those burned by Terra’s downfall, crypto – with all its highs and lows – appears to have left a mark on the talent it attracts.  “A bunch of hedge funds reached out to me too, asking if I wanted to go back to traditional finance,” Somani, the former Citadel staffer, told CoinDesk. “But I’m all-in on crypto.”",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LUNA | MARKET | MATIC,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/26/terra-devs-need-a-home-other-blockchains-are-courting-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7c5289dd7aae218241037e4f751d8261459977c-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What is SocialFi, what is its relevance in the crypto space, and how does it affect the way we use social media today? All of the answers can be found in the article below. What is SocialFi? SocialFi is an amalgamation of social media + finance, called Social Finance to create decentralized applications or dApps. Large companies control traditional social media, and there have been reports of privacy and security breaches in the past. SocialFi has developed a method of networking that protects users&apos; privacy and security while also giving them more control over the content they share. SocialFi allows users to make money from their content, but it also allows them to make money via decentralized activities like minting NFTs, converting crypto, and gaming. By issuing coinage, social projects control the communities they build. The value of the community will continue to rise, which is why Social Tokens were created. Because there is a finite quantity of tokens, their value rises as demand rises. Benefits for community members can be added by the creator, garnering even more fans. The inventor can eventually use the tokens as a kind of remuneration as the value of the tokens rises. Why Do Social Tokens Matter?

42411780,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzDp,1653598846,"What's the Crypto 'Travel Rule,' and What Does It Mean for You?","Almost three years after the controversial ""travel rule"" guidance was issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), regulators and virtual asset service providers (VASP) are still coming to terms with the economic and technical challenges of implementing these rules. While VASPs, which include but are not limited to crypto exchanges, wallet services and crypto custodial solutions, are the primary focus of this regulation, mass implementation is expected to slowly but surely impact how you interact with crypto.  In this guide, we will be discussing everything you need to know about the crypto travel rule and how it will affect your everyday crypto activities.  Read more: Is Bitcoin Legal?  What is the crypto travel rule?  In 2019, the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body that initiates anti-money laundering (AML) policies for G-7 and an additional 30 or so developed countries, recommended a coordinated approach to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The rule, formally known as FATF Recommendation #16, requires VASPs to communicate the information of the originators and beneficiaries of crypto transactions that exceed a certain threshold. More specifically, the regulations require VASPs to exchange information regarding the identities of the originator and beneficiary whenever the amount transacted is above $1,000.  In essence, whenever crypto worth over $1,000 is transacted between two parties, the crypto service provider of the sender is expected to communicate the personally identifiable information (PII) of the sender to the crypto service provider of the recipient and vice versa. While this is a given, member states can choose to interpret this guidance and implement versions that best suit their local crypto industries.  For instance, the threshold at which the crypto travel rule kicks in the U.S. is $3,000 (i.e., the rules come into play when the value of the crypto transaction exceeds $3,000). In such cases, VASPs are required to exchange information regarding the amount transacted, the execution date and the identity of the crypto service provider.  Switzerland is known to have a strict version of the travel rule, where regulators require the identification of private wallets interacting with local VASPs.  In addition to the extra information required by individual regulators, FATF recommends the following data ought to be transmitted back and forth by VASPs:  The names of the sender and the recipient  The address of the sender  The account number of the sender and the recipient  The travel rule existed before FATF’s 2019 recommendations. Initially, the regulation was targeted at banks and financial institutions as part of the initiatives for mitigating money laundering. In essence, FATF’s actions in 2019 only expanded this rule such that existing AML regulations can be replicated in the crypto industry. It is worth mentioning that prior to the issuance of the crypto travel rule in 2019, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), under the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), had imposed a similar rule on VASPs operating within its jurisdiction.  Hence, unlike most nations, the U.S. did not need to formulate a new regulation from scratch to comply with FATF’s recommendations. Under this rule, FinCEN requires crypto asset service providers to confirm that crypto transactions do not originate from or are not sent to sanctioned countries or companies.  Read more: What Is KYC and Why Does It Matter For Crypto?  Why is the crypto travel rule important?  As mentioned earlier, the core purpose of issuing this regulation is to block terrorist financing and money laundering. Below are other reasons the travel rule is important:  The travel rule ensures that crypto businesses adhere to sanctions.  It makes it easier for law enforcement to subpoena transaction data.  It is the first crypto regulation implemented globally, and it could potentially open the door for more uniform crypto regulation.  What are the challenges?  The first challenge associated with the crypto travel rule revolves around the nonuniform approach to the implementation of this regulation in different regions. As mentioned earlier, the requirements of the travel rule differ from country to country. Hence, VASPs are burdened with the task of incorporating robust self-compliance systems that would consider the different requirements of various countries and implement them accordingly. The nonuniformity of the crypto travel rules is popularly called the ""Sunrise Problem.""  Bearing in mind that VASPs are required to exchange transaction details, there is a need for an interoperable communication system such that VASPs can easily receive and send PII. This means the entirety of the crypto industry must embrace a collaborative approach to come up with the ideal data and communication standards.  Understandably, this is a tad difficult because the crypto industry historically favors a decentralized model of operation. That said, crypto service providers are coming to terms with this situation, with many adopting protocols specially designed to aid the transfer and collection of encrypted data. Examples of these protocols are OpenVASP, Shyft, TRISA and TRP.  More importantly, the crypto industry has reached a consensus over a single data messaging format for all travel rule protocols. This format is called IVMS 101.  Another main talking point is the perceived effect of the influx of digital asset regulation by a faction of the crypto community. Some believe that regulations like the travel rule empower regulators with the tools and data required to surveil and sanction crypto users.  Also worth mentioning is the apparent security risks to which VASPs will be exposed while transmitting users’ information. It is crucial to set up additional security systems that would shield users’ data from such risks.  Lastly, there are data privacy compliance risks that the travel rule exposes VASPs to. Much as VASPs are trying to adhere to the travel rule, they must ensure that their actions align with the data privacy laws of the jurisdictions where they operate.  What does this mean for you?  The first thing you should have at the back of your mind is that you may need to forego part of your privacy to continue to interact with the crypto market.  You will also have to know at least the name of your beneficiaries and those sending you payments. And since there are still challenges associated with the travel rule, there is no saying how the inefficiencies of any of the compliance systems would affect your user experience.  At the early phase of this regulatory revolution, you may be unable to execute transactions, depending on the compliance status of your VASP and that of your counterparty.

Bitso, which had more than 700 employees before the layoffs, still lists more than 60 open positions on its jobs page.  In its statement, the company mentioned the need to rethink the skills it needs from employees to move faster in the crypto industry as reasons for the cutbacks. It did not mention any difficulties in raising capital.  Bitso's layoffs come two days after the Argentina-based crypto exchange Buenbit laid off 45% of its staff — or roughly 80 employees — due to the “global overhaul” the tech industry has entered, according to its CEO, Federico Ogue.  Bitso has more than four million users in Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Brazil. The company told CoinDesk in January that it’s aiming to become the largest exchange in Brazil before the end of 2022. In Brazil, Bitso competes with local crypto exchange Mercado Bitcoin, the leader with more than four million customers.  Bitso's latest investment round was in May 2021, when it raised $250 million at a valuation of $2.2 billion, making it the first Latin American crypto unicorn.

42417153,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3pN,1653598075,SuperRare in SoHo: NFTs in the Real World,"SuperRare, a digital art market on Ethereum’s blockchain powered by the RARE token, debuted its first pop-up gallery on May 19 in SoHo, the historic New York City neighborhood known internationally for its affinity for artists and their art work.  The gallery’s opening is a prime example of the metaverse, a digital reality that exists both in the people’s collective imagination and across a network of computer nodes. It too looks to establish its physical footprint in art history.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Metaverse Week  The brightly lit, two-story exhibition, curated by An Rong and Mika Bar-On Nesher, centered around pieces from 15 SuperRare artists that touched on sci-fi and cyberpunk, themes integral to the idea and concept of the “metaverse.” The gallery, which will be open to the public until August 28, is looking to revolutionize how we relate to art in an increasingly digital age.  SoHo’s child, SuperRare’s first  Before SoHo welcomed a virtual world, it was made famous in the 1960s when artists flocked to the district, enticed by its open spaces, large windows and cheap rent. By the following decade, an area once known for its industrial job churning workforce and influx of businesses and artists, was plagued by displacement, prompting some of its tenants to move out.  Despite tumultuous conflict and division, it did not stop SoHo from blossoming. Today, the coveted neighborhood serves as the ideal spot where the meaning of art can be explored.  Visions from Remembered Futures is the marketplace’s first in real-world experience. In the past, SuperRare’s artwork has lived on a seventh floor gallery in the metaverse of Decentraland, a 3D-based platform that gives users the ability to buy virtual plots of land.  The digital marketplace has come a long way from its four-person startup once operating out of a coffee shop in Brooklyn, New York. Before the gallery found a home in the bustling streets of SoHo, Chief Product Officer Jonathan Perkins said that he and CEO John Crain would travel through Europe with backpacks full of iPads, constructing DIY gallery pop-ups where they could.  That experience gave them the leverage to take it a step further.  Perkins told CoinDesk during the gallery’s opening that “while digital is great, and the metaverse is exciting, having physical spaces to come together and enjoy art is important.”  “It makes the whole thing feel a lot more real,” Perkins said.  But it isn’t just about the art, Crain adds. With physical spaces, and more specifically with debut exhibitions, audiences have the opportunity to interact with the artists and learn more about them. “It humanizes their artistic process,” he said.  While the duo did not disclose the cost of the gallery space, nor the cost of putting on the exhibition itself, Perkins did note that it is “certainly the nicest and most high production value.”  NFTs join the art revolution  Mika Bar-On Nesher, the exhibition’s curator and production head, sees a shift in the way non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be used.  She compares that shift to her background in traditional art and explains one of the biggest misconceptions: For traditional art systems, NFTs combined with digital art “may actually be quite scary to embrace.” In part, because it empowers the artist.  “It completely revolutionizes the structures that exist right now in a way that has implications into the future,” Nesher said. “It’s not a trend, it’s a revolution in the way we monetize and experience art.”  Nesher’s comments come at a time when the burgeoning industry is shifting the conversation of what ownership can look like, what it can mean and in what ways cryptocurrencies play a role in disrupting the financial status quo.  Flowty founder Michael Levy recently alluded to a similar point during CoinDesk’s Road to Consensus “The Future of NFT Investing” Twitter spaces. Levy notes that it can be “dangerous to take old school valuation approaches from older technology or from previous generations of collectibles and utility products and apply that sort of valuation thinking to future projects.”  An Rong, the exhibition’s senior curator, found that new technology in tandem with NFTs were more of a reason to put on the exhibition.  Her first experience into NFTs came after earning her museum studies degree earlier this year. She jokingly shares a conversation she had with a friend and Ethereum researcher who suggested that “a blockchain could solve everything.”  Into the future we go  The NFT industry more broadly is projected to continue expanding in droves.  In January, banking behemoth Jefferies adjusted its market capitalization for NFTs to more than $35 billion for 2022. It predicts the industry will be worth upwards of $80 billion by 2025.  Data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen indicates that the total number of users buying and selling NFTs per week in 2022 has been typically higher than users in 2021.  While users may be categorized as both a buyer and seller within the same week, the number of wallets trading NFTs per week during 2022 has been greater than 300,000, except for the one week closing on May 16, 2022, which may be due to the lasting effects of Terra’s UST stablecoin collapse.  In comparison, the week closing on Dec. 20, 2021, was the only week in 2021 when the total number of users trading NFTs exceeded 300,000 wallets.  The increase in wallet activity in 2022 juxtaposed with wallet activity in 2021 hints at sustained enthusiasm and interest in NFTs.  Meanwhile, SuperRare's marketplace has seen an estimated $240 million worth of buying and selling of NFT-based digital art. Artists earn revenue on both original sales and resales.  Getting in meant changing the narrative  For NESSgraphics, finishing up his digital studies at University of Connecticut was making him feel like he was stuck in some repetitive cycle. He was looking to get out, often skipping classes for days at a time. But for good reason, and one that his professors, although weary, supported.  “I realized if I just kept doing what I do in these classes, I was just going to get spit out with everyone else, and essentially be just another number,” NESSgraphics told CoinDesk during the gallery’s opening.  He turned to social media, and began posting his artwork on Instagram, where he caught the attention of music industry executives. At the time, making graphics for pop rock band Imagine Dragons seemed to be more up his alley. And so, he pursued the unknown.  But the unknown was plagued by the COVID-19 pandemic, which destroyed the live music industry. And although NESSgraphics helped produce art for other prominent artists, such as Megan Thee Stallion, “the streaming shows were not the same.” By 2020, NESSgraphics had stumbled across SuperRare and dived in.  Instead of creating visuals based on other people’s visions, like he did while working in the live music industry, NESSgraphics was able to work on projects for longer periods of time, all while generating a higher income level for himself, via NFTs and SuperRare.  For example, five weeks worth of work in creating visual images for Imagine Dragons resulted in just $18,000 flowing into his pockets.  In terms of yearly income, before his dive into NFTs, NESSgraphics was making upwards of six figures a year, roughly $120,000.  Sure, it was good, but NFTs are more lucrative. “You can make that in a day,” he said, in addition to the royalties in the background.  Take for instance “R4G3QU1T.,” a one of a kind NFT that NESSgraphics minted on SuperRare a month ago. A user that goes by the name “artifaction” purchased it nine days ago for 55 ETH, roughly $115,032.  The story of NESSgraphics is unique because there isn’t another NESSgraphics nor another “R4G3QU1T.” NFT, and yet his lived experiences in both the physical and digital world reflect the larger sentiment where artists who specialize in digital creations are empowered and celebrated.  “This is a new chapter in galleries,” Rong said following the exhibition.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Fran Velasquez, Sage D.

Stepn said it will stop providing GPS services to users whose IP address or GPS location shows them in China on July 15. Without GPS services, players who own its membership-like shoe non-fungible token (NFT) will not be able to earn tokens for their steps.

42374630,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1ZOR,1653595679,"Market Wrap: Cryptos Down, Stocks Up; Altcoins Underperform","Most cryptocurrencies traded lower on Thursday, briefly decoupling from the rise in stock prices.  Bitcoin (BTC) continued to struggle below $30,000 and is down by 2% over the past week. The cryptocurrency has been stuck in a choppy trading range over the past two weeks, suggesting minor stabilization after a sharp sell-off earlier this month.  Meanwhile, the S&P 500 pared earlier losses, rising from oversold levels. Still, despite short-term variations, the 90-day correlation between bitcoin and stocks remains at an all-time high.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Alternative cryptos (altcoins) underperformed bitcoin on Thursday, indicating a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders. For example, ether (ETH) declined by 6% over the past 24 hours, compared with BTC's flat performance over the same period. Avalanche's AVAX token and Cosmos' ATOM token dipped by 10% on Thursday.  Typically, during down markets, altcoins decline more than bitcoin because of their higher risk profile.  Latest prices  ● Bitcoin (BTC): $29,363, −0.91%    ● Ether (ETH): $1,826, −6.48%    ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,058, +1.99%    ●Gold: $1,851 per troy ounce, +0.25%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.76%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Uptick in long liquidations  There was a slight uptick in BTC long liquidations over the past 24 hours, which occurred after the cryptocurrency declined toward $28,000 earlier in the New York trading day.  Still, the rise in long liquidations on Thursday was low compared with the recent peak earlier this month. Sometimes traders are forced to exit positions during times of high volatility, which can accelerate movements in the spot price.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading  Ether underperforms  Ether, the world's second-largest crypto by market cap, extended its down move relative to bitcoin on Thursday.  The weekly chart below shows the ETH/BTC price ratio, which broke below its 40-week moving average. The ratio could face further downside, similar to what occurred during the 2018 crypto bear market. The next level of support is at 0.043.  Similarly, bitcoin's market cap relative to the total crypto market cap (dominance ratio), accelerated its upward move. The ratio broke above a year-long downtrend earlier this month, which signaled risk-off conditions in the crypto market.  Altcoin roundup  SOL and DOGE dip: Tokens of the Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) protocols dipped the most among the major cryptocurrencies even as bitcoin (BTC) remained mostly unchanged for most of the New York trading day. SOL lost as much as 8% over the past 24 hours amid a continual “risk-off” sentiment for major cryptocurrencies, while DOGE dropped by as much as 5% over the same period. Read more here.  Tether enters Latin America: Tether on Thursday added to its roster of stablecoins, launching its MXNT token pegged to Mexico’s peso. The token will initially be supported in the Ethereum, Tron and Polyong blockchains, the company said. MXNT is Tether’s first foray into Latin America and joins the company’s other pegged coins — USDT (U.S. dollar), EURT (euro) and CNHT (China’s yuan).

42417145,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3i9,1653594660,Kevin McCoy: The Metaverse Is Going to Be Powered by Game Engines,"In 2014, after seeing Satoshi Nakamoto make bitcoin (BTC) a uniquely digital currency, Brooklyn, N.Y.-based artist Kevin McCoy became “obsessive” looking for a way to do the same with artwork.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Metaverse Week  As a digital artist, McCoy felt sidelined by galleries and museums, in part due to difficulties of physically exhibiting works that are native to a virtual space.  “So the strategy that many digital artists did back in the day, myself included, was to try to make some physical output from your digital work,” he said. “You’d turn it into a sculpture, you’d make some kind of print, or you’d come up with a robot or whatever. You turn it into a thing in some hopes of being able to participate in the art market.”  Eight years later, McCoy recalls this story while standing in front of nine translucent LG OLED screens displaying his non-fungible token (NFT) art, “Quantum Leap: Dark Star,” made in collaboration with his wife, Jennifer McCoy.  “Quantum Leap” is a generative, code-based NFT series of eight tokens that represents the life cycle of the stars, changing forms and colors over a three-year period. The series was inspired by his 2014 work “Quantum,” the first artwork tokenized on a blockchain.  Read More: How the Metaverse Could Be a Game-Changer for NFT Gaming  “Nobody really understood the idea of a tokenized digital artwork [and] using the blockchain as an ownership record and provenance back then,” McCoy said. “It was a real struggle.”  Sotheby’s (BID) touted “Quantum” as “universally regarded as the first NFT ever created,” and sold it at auction last June for $1.47 million. The McCoys have installed it at the center of their presentation at the Frieze Art Fair in New York.  “NFTs have invented this new form of ownable digital property, and that idea is just too important to ever go away,” he said.  NFTs as an on-ramp to the metaverse  Having seen his original vision for tokenized ownership of art metamorphose into what is today’s non-fungible tokens, McCoy sees NFTs being the on-ramp for a new way of life.  “As the world continues to digitize more and more and get virtualized more and more, the role of digital unique property is just going to increase, exponentially. So we’ll be living in that world,” he said.  Read More: How to Make It in the Metaverse  McCoy envisions a world in five to 10 years where software interaction with tokens is going to be more robust and dynamic than ever.  “The metaverse is going to be powered by game engines,” he said. “And connecting your wallet and your tokens to a game-engine environment is what that ground-level tech is going to be.”  McCoy compares this point in the development of the metaverse to the gaming revolution.  “The metaverse of today will be the original Nintendo of 10 years from now,” said McCoy, describing the watershed moment when Nintendo launched Mario Bros in 1985. The game about two plumbers navigating New York City’s labyrinthine underground pipes eventually spawned ""Super Mario Bros,"" a full-length movie and a cartoon series.  “The original Mario Bros … It’s like people’s cultural touchstones.”  More from Metaverse Week:  'Not About Playing It Safe': Krista Kim on How Artists Inspire the Metaverse  As contemporary artist Krista Kim sees it, there are too many corporate executives conceiving these new virtual worlds and not enough genuine creatives.

42421572,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeRp,1653593810,How to Prevent the Metaverse From Becoming a Nightmare,"Editor's note: As part of CoinDesk’s “Metaverse Week,” we asked a number of engineers, executives and experts to weigh in on the substantial issues raised by the crypto industry. This roundtable covers how to prevent the metaverse from becoming a nightmare, and touches on privacy-preserving layer 1s, decentralized data management and the necessity for consumer choice.  Bitcoin’s world  The word “metaverse” was coined by Neal Stephenson in his sci-fi classic “Snow Crash,” which describes a virtual world owned by corporations, where end users are treated as citizens in a dystopian corporate dictatorship. While the metaverse holds great promise, it clearly has the potential to become a dystopian nightmare where big tech has control over our data, experiences and privacy – which they have violated time and time again.  The good news is that there is a different model, one built on Bitcoin (the network) and using bitcoin (the native currency, BTC). By embedding the ethos of decentralized ledger technology – and the independence, privacy and freedom it fosters – the metaverse should instead empower humanity. It shouldn’t be hard to choose freedom (over your money, your data and your value) and a closed system with centralized currencies controlled by big tech. However, the philosophical differences between these two competing ideologies will intensify as projects develop.  – Will Reeves, CEO and co-founder of Fold  Content addressing  If all the virtual land, avatars, wearables and other forms of digital collectibles in the metaverse are just references to a file stored in a proprietary server, we’re only expanding the errors of Web 2 into Web 3. Even worse, in terms of data extraction, these digital objects could even give corporations and the government more information about us than Web 2 platforms ever did.  Our lives in the metaverse could produce new data points for our identity, economic behaviors, value judgments and more layers of social interaction. That valuable NFT (non-fungible token) art piece that could hang on the walls of a private room in the metaverse wouldn’t look as good next to the same pesky ads that are fed into our social media feeds.  Switching to peer-to-peer systems for decentralized storage and building the metaverse on this stack would ensure more privacy as well as true user ownership of the objects that produce this data. They would be fully owned and operated at all times by the users who upload it, with no disclosures to third parties.  See also: InterPlanetary File System Is Uncensorable During Corona  The metaverse could also benefit from capabilities such as content addressability and persistent storage that are native to the existing Web 3 storage infrastructure. All the information that renders beautiful digital landscapes, lavish 3D homes and personalized avatars would be stored redundantly in nodes across the world and retrievable at any time regardless of location. This would make metaverse worlds censorship-resistant as well.  If we want to prevent the metaverse from facing the problems imagined in “Snow Crash,” our digital property and data has to be privately distributed among peers. It shouldn’t end up in servers owned by a real-life L. Bob Rife figure.  – HQ Han, ecosystem growth lead for Protocol Labs  4 imperatives  The metaverse has the potential to become one of the most creatively empowering digital innovations in history. On the other hand, it could also evolve into surveillance capitalism at an unprecedented scale. Will we favor community-led, rich, authentic and fragmented decentralized networks? Or fall for simpler, user-friendly and tightly coordinated closed platforms?  From a philosophical point of view, the correct choice seems obvious. From a technical standpoint, things are more complicated. The trajectory of the metaverse will depend on the data architecture choices we make as users and builders. The path in favor of a more equitable metaverse is being charted today, built upon a few key imperatives:  Decentralization: Credible neutrality and provable persistence are all prerequisites to make the metaverse a welcoming place.  Standardization: In order for fragmented worlds and assets to express their full value, establishing standards early on is paramount.  Access: Usability and affordability are two elements preventing Web 3-based metaverse adoption. In order for decentralized ecosystems to thrive, many barriers to access need to be lifted.  Agency: The metaverse needs to be built with user agency in mind. This is a topic involving design, technical and behavioral challenges.  Self-sovereign identity and protocols like IPFS represent an unavoidable piece of the toolkit required to build a welcoming metaverse.  – Justine Massicotte, chief technology officer and co-founder of Lighthouse Labs  Self-sovereign data management  Self-sovereign identity will play a crucial role in the metaverse. Being able to manage our own data and identity will give us more control over who has access to our information and what they are allowed to do with it. We believe data sharing should be off by default in the metaverse, with users opting in only to experiences of interest. Being able to approve instances of data sharing independently will provide users with more granular control over information they share. The ideal Web 3 identity component will also be programmable, composable and dynamic in being able to reveal only data that is needed at any given time.  The emergence of the metaverse with decentralized, self-sovereign identity as a standard will change everything about how we interact with digital platforms, and how those platforms are able to interact with our data. We will have more control over how we are represented, who knows what about us as well as secure, effortless access to everything the metaverse has to offer.  – Chris Hart, CEO of Civic  Zero-knowledge  The metaverse has become a term associated with the future of the internet, evoking imagery of an interconnected web of virtual worlds, each guided by their own aesthetic, capabilities and set of rules. The ""set of rules"" component is important. None of us wants to participate in a digital universe where our data and identity are vulnerable to exploitation, and this is a very real fear given the history of data breaches, identity thefts, ransomware attacks, stolen funds and surveillance. This is why private digital identity is so key to the metaverse's success and long-term viability.  See also: Can Crypto Deliver on Private Transactions in Cashless World? | Roundtable  The best method we have for making private digital ID a reality is by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to give users control over their digital ID. If we continue to give this responsibility to the applications themselves, as we have done in Web 2, our data will remain vulnerable to hacks, thefts and fraud. By granting users control over their data via zero-knowledge proof-based protocols and applications, users are empowered with the tools they need to share only as much information as is necessary to access a good or service without rendering themselves vulnerable to data exploitation.  – Kurt Hemecker, chief operating officer of the Mina Foundation  Negative trends  The more data that is online, the more vulnerable we are to data hacks and phishing scams. COVID-19 proved this by spurring a mass data migration to online as companies around the globe transitioned to remote work, which led to an enormous uptick in cyber attacks. Perhaps most alarming is how the health care industry was impacted. As more of our lives transition into the metaverse – including medicine and banking – expect these negative trends to replicate and multiply. Such vulnerability to data exploitation will be the reality unless we implement solutions to protect sensitive user information. The only way to achieve this is to ensure data is stored in a decentralized manner, eliminating single points of failure that are inherent to centralized cloud storage systems and giving users local control over their information.  – Anthem Blanchard, CEO of HeraSoft  Private layer 1s  Given the abundance of user data generated within metaverse platforms, this online ecosystem has the potential to become the most valuable, diverse source of consumer data in the world. But as more people spend more time in the metaverse their data will increasingly be gathered in the background or inferred through their online activity, rather than manually input into a website or other observable query.  That’s why it isn’t enough for user data management to be relegated to a decentralized network of anonymous node operators. The safest and most effective approach is to integrate next-generation privacy tools such as zero-knowledge proofs into everyday metaverse interactions so that users can verify their identities and execute transactions without disclosing any of their personal information to anyone – not even the other parties they’re interacting with.  Many crypto exploits occur at the intersection between different blockchain networks, or on layer 1 networks that attempt to retroactively apply privacy protocols atop their base architecture. As the metaverse balloons in size and integrates across different projects, it will be increasingly crucial to built atop a privacy-enhancing L1 network that have user protections embedded in its core.  – Antoni Zolciak, co-founder of Aleph Zero  More from Metaverse Week:  A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  Verifiable, immutable ownership of digital goods and currency will be an essential component of the metaverse.  Virtual Beers and Digital Orgasms: Welcome to the Age of Metaverse Commerce  Executives from Adidas, Budweiser, Clinique, NARS Cosmetics and other big consumer brands explain why the metaverse is “seismic” for their businesses.

What’s more, events like the collapse of terraUSD’s (UST) stablecoin could be adding to crypto’s recent pullback. However, one asset manager sees the digital currency world’s rebound coming soon.  “I think in the near term, we [crypto] will find our footing,” Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  Grayscale, one of the largest players in crypto and a sister company to CoinDesk, has over $25 billion in assets under management.  Sonnenshein also noted that following the collapse of UST, one of the largest algorithmic stablecoins, all stablecoins remain a concern in the ecosystem even as they remain the backbone of crypto markets.  “Investors are focusing on items like stablecoin governance [and] supply collateral, and over time ensuring that the stablecoins they are involved with are in fact functioning the way they’re designed to do so,” he said.  Much to the detriment of its investors, tech stocks have also suffered low trading volumes and selling pressure. Since the start of 2022, bitcoin's (BTC) price has fallen by more than 35%.  Yet, Sonnenshein doesn't see the downturn lasting. Like many in the crypto asset world, he sees a potential for a future upside.  “I think that markets will continue to find their footing,” he said.  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale’s flagship investment vehicle that it wants to convert to an exchange-traded fund (ETF), would love to attract those investors. The company is hoping the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves the conversion, although the SEC has yet to approve any ETF that holds actual bitcoin. GBTC is currently trading at a discount of around 30% of its net asset value.  Ultimately, Sonnenshein cites a “function of market forces,” including a liquidity crunch, that are contributing to GBTC's and bitcoin’s trading prices.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/26/bitcoin-will-find-its-footing-according-to-grayscale-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11927bf216706f1f27f6ef60866393711ed8a300-1878x1112.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The &apos;exchange whale ratio&apos; is an indicator that&apos;s defined as the sum of top ten inflows to exchanges divided by the total inflows. In simpler terms, this metric tells us what part of the total inflows are contributed by the ten largest transactions, which typically belong to the whales. When the value of this indicator is above 0.85, it means whales occupy a very large percentage of exchange inflows right now. As investors usually transfer their Bitcoin to exchanges for selling purposes, such a trend can be a sign that whales are dumping at the moment. The indicator&apos;s value usually remains above this threshold during BTC bear markets, or fake bull for mass dumping.

42421581,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoea5,1653591003,What Happens When You Die in the Metaverse?,"Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, the most used blockchain, thinks he found the next big opportunity in crypto. He wants distributed ledgers to help create and manage our identities – both on and offline – using “soulbound tokens” (SBT).  In a recently published paper, “Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul,” co-authored with Flashbots’ Puja Ohlhaver and Microsoft’s Glen Weyl, Buterin outlines a cryptographic tool similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that could be used as a sort of living, transparent and immutable curriculum vitae (CV).  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. This article is also part of ""Metaverse Week.""  NFTs are tokens used to give other digital media a type of traceable identity and market price. SBTs are similar in design but would be unique to one person’s life and would not be transferable. The idea is for a type of credentialing system, appended to the blockchain.  “Imagine a world where most participants have Souls [digital wallets] that store SBTs corresponding to a series of affiliations, memberships, and credentials,” the 37-page research paper reads. Institutions like universities would issue graduates SBTs as a type of digital diploma, or lenders could give someone a token if they pay off a loan.  The benefit would be having a transparent record of someone’s achievements that could not be tampered with. (Though, it might be said, the paper proposes SBTs might be revoked by institutions or burned by holders, if the circumstance called for it.)  Further, as a crypto asset, these tokens could be plugged into the interoperable world of Web 3 potentially enabling a host of “use cases.” And, they would also give holders control over their important documents – potentially an improvement to the current system where credentials are maintained by a host of third parties and our identities fragmented across the web.  Last year, Ethereum propagandists at Bankless began spreading a meme that someone’s MetaMask wallet (a popular tool used to interact with Ethereum) is better than a resume. The blockchain records a ledger of people’s activities in crypto; and so, if you want to demonstrate firsthand expertise, it could arguably be better to show what tokens you hold and what “smart contracts” you’ve engaged.  Soulbound tokens operate from the same perspective and could become operational by the end of this year, Weyl said. He and Buterin also said that these assets could be central to the anticipated crypto hype-cycle in 2024, similar to how initial coin offerings (ICOs) dominated 2017, and NFTs were adopted over the previous two years.  See also: NFTs: Boom, Bust or Balance Out in 2022?  Apart from a tone-deaf brand name, SBTs do present some risks. The Defiant, another crypto news service, reported that because you hold the keys to your soul's tokens there is some chance of losing your identity permanently. Institutions might also send you spam credentials.  The larger issue stems from whether we want our achievements and life-defining associations always on view. And, if you could spare the brief interlude, it raises important questions about who we are when we’re online and whether we want our digital avatars to be carbon copies of our carbon-based bodies.  Digital identity  What happens when you die in the metaverse? Around the time the corporate entity formerly known as Facebook announced its pivot to the metaverse, a handful of people began asking that very question.  There was a ready-made answer that “if you die in the metaverse, you die in real life.” The sentiment and the quote was often attributed to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and frequently paired with an image of a bug-eyed Zuckerberg.  The origins of this meme are unknown and not yet documented on internet archival project Know Your Meme. But the response makes sense in the context of Facebook’s current societal standing and the company’s business history.  In the early days of social media when Facebook adoption was ever accelerating, the company operated around the idea that digital identity was coequal with real life and that transparency would unite and improve the world.  “I think [Zuckerberg] genuinely believed that people should share more, and that it would be good for his company as well,” Wired editor Stephen Levy told CoinDesk in a previous interview. Levy’s book, “Facebook: The Inside Story,” published in 2020, argued the company’s fall from grace was the result of its massive ambition to “connect the world.”  Facebook pages, for many years, were public by default. The company also pushed forward applications like Beacon that would update your social media status based on your location or what you were doing – without your consent. Your email associated with your Facebook account was made readily accessible to others.  “Privacy of users was clearly a secondary consideration, and I cite numerous instances in the book where Zuckerberg weighs growth and ‘sharing’ over the objections of his executives,” Levy said. The company has since changed course and instituted stronger privacy assurance in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  Digital identity is a curious thing. In many ways, the people we are online are real extensions of our total experience. In other ways, however, the internet profoundly changes how we act or what we might choose to do. Cyber bullying is rampant, for instance, because the repercussions are less severe than some experts have said.  Online identity is currently mediated by the tools and platforms we use. Twitter is different from Facebook, and your writing style changes whether you’re sending an email or publishing on Medium.  The open metaverse is an attempt to bridge all of these digital environments, while also enabling more life-like experiences. You’re in the metaverse, not just logging online. Static digital avatars, potentially controlled through ownable assets like NFTs, would also be able to move gracefully from place to place in the metaverse.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Paul Dylan-Ennis  By creating a more permanent and controllable digital self, perhaps it is fair to say that if you die in the metaverse you die in real life. You lose something of value because the whole idea is to treat your “hyperreal” self as an actual person (not just an account owned by Facebook).  Buterin may not have been considering the metaverse when theorizing SBTs – but the tools want to enable similar things. “Souls can encode the trust networks of the real economy to establish provenance and reputation,” he wrote.  SBTs and the metaverse are about establishing real reputations online. People can already feel a great sense of loss when message boards die out, or when their pseudonyms are kicked off Twitter – and this feeling could be heightened if we successfully integrate more real-life attributes into the digital world. SBTs, permanent personal records, are the apogee of this.  It’s still unknown the extent to which we can successfully intermix the worlds of atoms and bits – but it’s not a terrible idea to imbue digital environments and people with greater importance. Many on social media know the feeling of being harassed or disrespected. Some of this must be caused by the distance between people when they’re online, geographically and metaphysically.  Obviously, when you die in the metaverse you will continue on as a living, breathing being. Likewise, there are attempts right now to extend human life using digital tools.  Beyond the human  Buterin reportedly subscribes to some transhumanist views, or the idea that the natural limitations of the human condition can be transcended. We might live forever with the right combination of drug and lifestyle. Or we might carry on as a floating consciousness uploaded to a computer.  “What happens to a person’s belongings when they die in the physical world is determined by legal processes, but in the metaverse code is law,” HQ Han, who runs ecosystem growth for Protocol Labs, told CoinDesk. And so, we need tools to account for inheritance and recuperation of digital assets in case of death, Han said.  See also: The Transhumanist Case for Crypto | The Node  I don’t know what is possible when it comes to creating eternal digital lives. I don’t know if that is desirable. I do know, however, that the digital world is becoming increasingly salient and important – if only because people like Buterin keep pushing that direction. Crypto assets, at their best, allow the digital to actually be valuable.  So, what happens when we die in the metaverse? What may be “more important,” Han said, “is the guarantee that there is something to leave behind in the first place.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/26/what-happens-when-you-die-in-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cab85b4b4704424fc703a9b2d3062d1f5c9129b6-2048x1820.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In Brainard’s first testimony after her recent swearing-in ceremony to take over the Fed board’s vice chair role, she told the House Financial Services Committee that the Fed is still studying the question and wouldn’t move before approval from the White House and Congress – which in itself could add a considerable period of debate before an authorizing law can be passed.  “It takes a long time,” Brainard said in a Thursday hearing, comparing such a project with the Fed’s still incomplete real-time payments system that has taken years to build. “It could take five years to put in place the requisite security features, the design features.”  As to those design features, Brainard said it’s “probably preferable not to have an interest-bearing digital currency,"" answering some bankers’ concerns that a digital dollar could take a massive and potentially fatal bite out of their deposit business. She also mentioned the Fed is considering caps on digital dollar holdings to encourage customers to use them only for payments and not as a safe asset for people or businesses to pile their money into.  If the Fed does launch a digital dollar, Brainard said the asset could coexist with stablecoins and the existing financial system.  “I really see the potential for a digital dollar as being complementary to a more stable, efficient system that would include stablecoins and commercial bank money, so I really see them potentially enabling private sector innovation,” she said. CBDC holdings and transactions would still be managed through private sector accounts, Brainard confirmed, and not at direct customer accounts at the Fed.

42417149,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3mH,1653590294,5 Principles to Guide Design in the Metaverse,"Want to ensure the metaverse lives up to its promise? That requires listening to and learning from your community, unleashing your imagination, and letting what’s worked, and hasn’t worked, guide us as we create new, immersive experiences.  While the metaverse is a term used in a variety of ways and even taking on different meanings, for us at Roblox (dubbed “the nearest and most expansive vision of the metaverse”) it’s about human co-experience – people sharing experiences in immersive 3D spaces.  Morgan Tucker is Head of Product, Music, Brands & Education at Roblox. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Metaverse Week.  Two key factors are critical. These experiences are social. You do them with other people, not on your own. And they’re immersive. That doesn’t mean you have to go out and buy expensive hardware or fancy headsets, but rather that your mind’s eye is in the experience. You feel immersed, like you are really there.  Instead of passively reading textbooks or watching videos about ancient Rome, you actively step into an immersive 3D recreation and explore the city and its culture with your friends. Or instead of shopping on a site to choose your next pair of Vans, you walk into a virtual Vans skatepark, quickly customize and put on your new virtual sneakers, and then have fun practicing skateboarding tricks with your friends and other like-minded skateboarders.  Having created a vast array of experiences, from concerts to Webby-award winning conceptual fashion exhibitions visited by millions, we’ve identified best practices to keep in mind. In addition to democratizing and broadening the reach of people’s favorite real-life experiences to a more global audience in the metaverse, we can improve on these experiences thanks to the power of collective creativity.  When approaching a new metaverse project, here are five core principles for designing memorable and truly immersive experiences:  The metaverse starts with the best parts of reality...  Then enhance them by creating things that have never been seen before. When imagining a new experience, we find it’s best to start with reality as a baseline, then immediately identify the possibilities if the constraints of space and time were lifted.  Read More: How to Get Started in The Sandbox  For example, when creating concepts for a concert, we stop and think about big moments that generate excitement in the real world. Think about that feeling you get when the jumbotron shows you in the audience, even for a moment. We could recreate that digitally, but why stop there? Why not transport the audience members onto the stage to join the artist, see how they are playing their instruments, or even join them by showing off your dance moves? Instead of changing the visuals or setting pieces on a stage, we can transport the audience to an entirely new world, where the laws of gravity are upended, creating surprise and delight. It’s not enough to just recreate reality, we must utilize the full potential of the metaverse to create a truly unique moment.  Give metaverse users agency and autonomy  The fastest path to creating surprising, one-of-a-kind experiences is to give power and control to the audience. As designers we are often looking for ways to curate the “perfect” experience, but that can sometimes feel a little soulless and inauthentic. Influence, don’t control the audience. This ensures that every experience is unique to the individual.  Don’t treat participants as passive observers, but rather empower them to truly engage in the experience. For example, during an IRL concert, people cheering generate energy as a crowd, which can absolutely sway the outcome of a performance. For us, in the Lil Nas X concert, the audience were considered as a part of the canvas from the outset. In these multi-sensory experiences people can participate in new ways, so take advantage of that.  Show, don't tell  Humans are innately visual creatures. Besides, verbal and written communication can be a barrier when you are dealing with a global audience in the metaverse. Experiences powered by visuals allow people to interact with one another without using words.  Read More: How to Make It in the Metaverse  For example, encourage people to leverage their avatars as a vehicle for self-expression. By gesticulating, people can have emotionally resonant experiences with one another. This is why for musical experiences we build tools for users to wave at each other, show dance moves and meaningfully express themselves. The concert then becomes a vibrant, expressive environment as compared to a room full of avatars standing still.  Optimize for emotional impact  Emotion burns itself indelibly into our consciousness as memory. When done well, digital experiences can evoke strong enough emotions for the brain to remember these experiences as reality. Ultimately, with shared experiences in digital spaces, you want to be creating memorable experiences. That’s one of the great opportunities that the metaverse presents.  We think about virtual events as life experiences that are comparable to the real world. Dialing in the emotional impact of the things you are designing is critical. A word of caution though: it’s also the single most complex part of creating Metaverse experiences. How do you identify an emotion and translate it digitally?  When planning the 21 Pilots concert, we thought of key moments in songs and how to have the audience really feel the music, by focusing on the right things at the right time. The stage sent waves through the ground and into the crowd when the drummer hit the drums. And when all the musicians tore it up in one big moment in a song, the environment crumbled and sent frantic energy around the set.  Strong vision weathers technical adversity  We are forging new ground every day, and sometimes, we just don’t know if the ideas in our heads are technically feasible. But that’s okay. By leading a project with a clear creative vision, you will find ways to convey the most important parts of your experience regardless of the technical constraints. It’s easy to get bogged down in the details when using a multi-sensory canvas, but by focusing on your vision – how is this better than reality, how are we letting the user control the outcome, did we strip away unnecessary words, and do people really feel something – we can create something new and inspirational.  As architects of the metaverse, we are responsible for the broad strokes. Our digital citizens are the ones who will fill in the details, crafting their own narrative. By challenging the status quo, and giving power to the user, we are ensuring that every experience can be as unique as the individuals visiting them. I can’t wait to see what you’ll create!

Overall, TOMO coin prices are in range, moving horizontally and defying gravity. Nonetheless, TOMO token prices are under intense selling pressure since the primary trend is bearish. TomoChain Technical Analysis The primary trend for TomoChain coin prices is southward. Bulls are yet to break above the middle BB despite attempts for higher highs in the past trading day. Besides, the immediate resistance level stands at around $0.70. This level flashes with May 11 highs and is a crucial reaction level that buyers must break to signal a welcomed price turnaround.

Because of the failure of TOMO token bulls to reverse May 11 and 12 losses, sellers are dominant from an effort-versus-results perspective.

Funds from the company’s “Pooly” NFT collection, released on Thursday, will go toward “supporting PoolTogether Inc. in defending against the class action lawsuit,” according to its website.  PoolTogether is an app-based, no-loss savings game where users can win prizes for depositing funds on the platform, using DeFi protocols on the back end.  The lawsuit in question dates back to last October, when Joe Kent – a former staffer for the notoriously anti-crypto Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) – sued PoolTogether for violating New York state’s gambling laws.  In his complaint, Kent is also described as being “gravely concerned that the cryptocurrency ecosystem – which requires the use of enormous amounts of electricity – is accelerating climate change and allowing people to evade financial regulations and scam consumers,” – concerns which match those espoused by his former boss, Sen. Warren.  Kent’s suit against PoolTogether is seen as a test case to change the landscape of DeFi regulation, with the plaintiff having only deposited $10 on the platform before filing the suit.  Kent’s suit names PoolTogether, the Brooklyn-based corporation, and its founder, Brooklyn resident Leighton Cusack, as well as a host of the protocol’s investors, including Dragonfly Capital, Compound Labs and Galaxy Digital Capital Management, as defendants. Individual investors in the project, including Stanislav Kulechov, the founder and CEO of DeFi platform Aave, are also named.  By naming both the company and its investors, Kent’s suit seeks to determine who is legally responsible when a DeFi protocol “harms” a user. Depending on the outcome of the case, this could have enormous ramifications for decentralized projects – including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – as a whole.  The crypto community has rallied around PoolTogether and Cusack, who announced the Pooly drop on Twitter on Thursday. Within two hours of its launch, the collection had raised 73 ETH (around $135,000), with its target goal set at 769 ETH (around $1,425,000) with 27 days left to mint.  The NFTs are available in three editions for .1 ETH, 1 ETH and 75 ETH apiece, with PoolTogether encouraging holders to spread the word by changing their profile pictures to the Pooly NFTs on Twitter.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,"Eli Tan, Cheyenne Ligon",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/26/defis-pooltogether-crowdfunds-legal-defense-with-nft-collection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d9881fb8ab15e061e69ed048748dd5716d63945-2282x1428.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since more advanced mining chips are introduced, the hashrate of mining rigs has been on the rise, making mining extremely difficult. Meanwhile, hashrates are centralized by big mining farms and large institutions, and retail miners now struggle to gain the right of block updating solely relying on their own hashrates. To stay in the game, more and more miners choose to join a mining pool for stable mining revenue. Before choosing one from many mining pools out there, miners should think about the following factors. First, brand recognition. In general, famous pools are more reliable because they are often highly recognized by the miner community. Second, user experience in both the products and the services the pool provided. A pool with a full range of products, in most cases, enables efficient and convenient mining experiences. All in all, brand recognition, and user experience in products and services are all backed by the tech capacity of the team behind the pool. Strong tech capacity allows a pool to offer a sound mining environment, so as to better safeguard the interests of miners. 6 years of solid steps: ViaBTC is reliable and trustworthy In March 2016, Haipo Yang, the founder of ViaBTC, developed and deployed ViaBTC Pool on his own.

Expanding further than just being an online currency, digital coins also give investors the power to vote on issues concerning the relevant protocols. Starting With the Basics Web3 (also known as Web3.0) is the next generation of the internet, an ecosystem that is decentralized in nature, integrating the power of blockchains, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), cryptocurrency and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Although these concepts have been floating around the web for quite some time - some still find it difficult to fully understand what all of them mean. Blockchains are online ledgers that store information across a number of locations on a network, which makes hacking and data leaks a thing of the past. NFTs are one-of-a-kind, digital assets, which live on a blockchain, can be purchased and sold freely, or be held as an investment. DAOs are the next generation of organizations, which function on rules that are encoded on blockchains, ensuring full transparency and decentralized, democratic governing bodies.

This means that it is not decentralized like a DEX. However, this also means that it is subject to more regulation. CEXs are generally considered to be more user-friendly than DEXs and offer more features. However, they are also considered to be riskier due to the fact that they are centralized. The cryptocurrency derivatives exchange launched in May 2019. Besides, the exchange offers futures contracts, margin trading, and spot trading for a variety of digital assets. The assets include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, EOS, and more. But does FTX facilitate safe trade for its users? Let&apos;s find out. What Are The Unique Features of FTX? Some of the unique features of FTX include: Tokenized versions of popular indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100. A variety of order types including limit, market, stop-limit, and iceberg orders. Negative funding rates for some contracts which allow users to earn interest on their positions. The ability to short spot cryptocurrencies with up to 100x leverage. An intuitive and user-friendly interface. The exchange does not seem to suffer from the issue of liquidity. In fact, there have been no reports of any problems with regard to liquidity on the exchange. This is probably due to the fact that FTX is a relatively new exchange and has not yet reached the level of popularity of some of the more established exchanges.

The concept brings together the world of DAOs as well as GameFi. Understanding both concepts separately is the core to grasping the integration of these two worlds. The Basics of DAOs You might have heard the concept of Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) floating around on the internet as of late, but what is it all about? DAOs are the new age of organisations, which decentralises its structures and processes - steering away from traditional, hierarchical organisational structures. The decentralisation of organisations means that there is not one single governing party (such as a CEO), but rather providing multiple stakeholders the opportunity to have a say in major company decisions, ultimately providing a flat organisational structure. DAOs are made possible with advanced blockchain technology, where specific rules set up by the DAO are automated through codes, also known as smart contracts. This means that as long as the rules are followed by involved parties within the group/organisation - the funds and processes will be available. The premise of choosing DAOs over traditional organisational structures is based on eliminating human error, cutting out singular decision making, and focusing on building a truly democratic organisation.

Cowen initiated research coverage on Coinbase with an outperform rating and an $85 price target.  The company's shares currently trade around $70 and have lost more than 70% in value this year as crypto and equity markets have weakened.  The current structure of the exchange industry suggests the risk of competition driving fees lower in the near term is low because the platforms “also compete on security/trust of platform, access to assets, ease of use, customer support, and alternative products,” Glagola said in the note.  Material fee compression is possible in the longer term as the industry matures, he said.  Cowen estimates that Coinbase accounted for about 46% of U.S. regulated centralized exchange spot crypto volume as of 2021, up from 39% in 2020.  Glagola said he expects the introduction of Coinbase's crypto derivatives in the U.S., assuming regulatory approval, to be a catalyst for growth along with the potential for “off-shore liquidity moving back to U.S.”  Coinbase is the third-largest crypto exchange by volume worldwide, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The token will initially be supported in the Ethereum, Tron and Polyong blockchains, the company said. MXNT is Tether’s first foray into Latin America and joins the company’s other pegged coins — USDT (U.S. dollar), EURT (euro) and CNHT (China’s yuan).  Mexico is “a prime location for the next Latin American crypto hub,” said Tether, noting a report from Triple A stating that 40% of Mexican companies are interested in adopting blockchain and crypto in some way.  “We have seen a rise in cryptocurrency usage in Latin America over the last year that has made it apparent that we need to expand our offerings,” said Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino. The company bills this effort as a “testing ground” in Latin America that it expects will “pave the way” for more fiat-pegged tokens in the region.  Tether also took note of the “unique opportunity” in Mexico thanks to the multibillion-dollar flow of remittances into that country, and the difficulties involved with internal money transfers.  In 2021 Mexico was the third-largest recipient of remittances worldwide after China and India, with nationals living abroad having sent $51.6 billion to the country, according to the Mexican central bank.  Tether isn’t the first to notice the Mexican remittance phenomenon, which previously caught the attention of large crypto players including Coinbase, Bitso and Circle. Earlier this year, Coinbase (COIN) launched a cash-out service to convert local pesos to crypto at more than 37,000 physical retail outlets and convenience stores across the country.  In November, Latin American crypto exchange Bitso partnered with Circle to launch an international wire transfer product that allows small business and freelancers to change their dollars to stablecoins, send them to Mexico and then be collected in pesos.

She also wrote that thoughtful regulation is necessary given the recent collapse of terraUSD (UST) and luna (LUNA). “The rapid ongoing evolution of the digital financial system at the national and international levels should lead us to frame the question not as whether there is a need for a central-bank-issued digital dollar today, but rather whether there may be conditions in the future that may give rise to such a need,” Brainard said. “We recognize there are risks of not acting, just as there are risks of acting.""  Brainard also addressed the capabilities of a CBDC to facilitate global payments, and how the U.S. can serve as an example in digital finance with “privacy, accessibility, interoperability, and security.”  For its part, the Federal Reserve has been soliciting comments recently on the advisability of setting up a CBDC.

""It will come, it will come, in due course, yeah,"" responded an at least a modestly uncomfortable Lagarde when presented with the sharp upward-and-to-the-right graph of the central bank's balance sheet, and asked how she plans to bring it down. ""How?"" the questioner during an episode of the ""College Tour"" TV show pressed again. ""In due course, it will come,"" she assured.  The EU's most recent report estimated inflation in the Euro area at 7.5% in April, up from 5.1% three months earlier and 1.6% a year prior.  Look at the ""counterfactual,"" argued Lagarde. Had the ECB not stepped in with an emergency package of asset purchases as the COVID lockdowns began, and massively boosted that program as the pandemic continued, the damage to EU economies would have been devastating.  Earlier in the interview, Lagarde said that crypto (bitcoin included) was worth nothing. Asked by an audience member if she owned digital assets, Lagarde said no, but allowed that her son had invested.

42374629,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1ZNB,1653571792,"First Mover Americas: BTC Dominance Reaches 7-Month Highs, Alts Suffer","Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: Altcoins took a hit in price this morning, with ether dropping more than $100 in an hour.  Market Moves: Bitcoin dominance over altcoins reached a seven-month high. The last time it reached this level was in October 2021.  Feature: We take a look at data showing how USD coin (USDC) has become the stablecoin of choice on the Ethereum blockchain, not the larger tether (USDT).  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was down 1.7% over the last 24 hours and is struggling to hold $30,000. At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading around $29,000.  Ethereum (ETH) took a bigger hit and was trading down 6.5% on the day, around $1,800.  “With BTC’s price not catching a bid to the upside the negativity comes out,” said Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index platform.  “The narrative around BTC and crypto, in general, goes from a futuristic store of value to a scam,” said Storry. ""This brings down the price till investor sentiment changes and we move back to the upside.""  Altcoins appear to be suffering more than BTC, with Avalanche (AVAX) leading the drop in price. AVAX was down 12% on the day, Cosmos’ ATOM down by 10.5% and Solana’s SOL by 8%.  In traditional markets, Wall Street had a positive trading session overnight, but has since been mixed. Bonds gained ground as traders weighed the Fed’s minutes that were less hawkish than expected. News from China overnight sent Asian markets and European futures lower.  Market Moves  Despite BTC’s market capitalization declining to $552 billion, bitcoin dominance over altcoins is at a seven-month high. BTC dominance – the measure of how much of the total market cap of crypto is comprised of bitcoin – has increased to 45%, the highest the metric has gone up to since October 2021.  However, signals for BTC are still not showing signs of recovery, according to Laurent Kssis, head of Europe at Hashdex.  “We may see further downward trends in altcoins as there are still strong signs BTC is to remain below $30,000,” said Kssis, in an interview with CoinDesk.  Kssis noted that ether’s drop in price Thursday was particularly significant (ether dropped by $100 at around 9:00 UTC).  ""We saw large sellers dominating the market in ether this morning which was fueled by losing interest. This is a clear absence of a bullish volatility currently witnessed in the crypto market,” said Kssis.

Feature: Terra Snapshot Expected This Week. Here’s How 'New' Luna Will Be Distributed  By Krisztian Sandor  There has been a change in the thinking of the large crypto investors known as whales. Data shows USD coin (USDC) has become the stablecoin of choice on the Ethereum blockchain, not the larger tether (USDT).  In crypto, whales are the biggest cryptocurrency holders – institutional investors, exchanges, deep-pocketed individuals – who are capable of moving large amounts of tokens and swaying market prices. Analysts closely watch their activity to spot trends and anticipate large price movements.  Data from CoinMetrics, a blockchain analysis firm, shows wallet addresses on the Ethereum blockchain that hold more than $1 million USDC surpassed the number of wallets that hold USDT, still the largest stablecoin by market cap.  “In the current market condition, a lot of people view USDC as the safer, preferred stablecoin,"" Edward Moya, trading platform Oanda’s senior market analyst, told CoinDesk.  USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, has been gaining market share since the once-$18 billion UST stablecoin collapsed, and USDT’s peg to the dollar wobbled.  CoinMetrics looked at blockchain data since May 9, when UST lost its peg to the U.S. dollar. The firm identified 147 Ethereum wallet addresses that increased their USDC balance by at least $1 million while decreasing their USDT balance by at least $1 million. Among them, there were 23 that added at least $10 million USDC and disposed of $10 million USDT. Many of these addresses are exchanges, custodial services or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, the report added.  The report also said USDC’s advantage over Tether's USDT in so-called free float supply – the number of tokens that investors hold – on the Ethereum blockchain hit an all-time high on Tuesday among all holder groups.  ""This likely reflects the fact that only large holders are generally privileged to redeem USDT and mint new USDC to capture an arbitrage,"" Kyle Waters, analyst at CoinMetrics, wrote in the report. ""But it might also be the case that some large accounts are de-risking their holdings, turning to the perceived assurances of USDC’s monthly attestations and full-reserve backing.""

London-based Asset Reality, a specialist when it comes to investigating and recovering stolen crypto assets, will act as a case handler and help MetaMask users around the globe build an investigation in the event they fall victim to fraud, the companies said Thursday.  MetaMask, which now boasts over 30 million monthly active users, sees a good deal of ticket requests relating to losses, many of which involve malicious actors conducting phishing attacks or orchestrating social engineering of some sort, said Alex Herman, MetaMask’s support product lead.  “We wanted to offer something to users beyond a handshake and good luck at the end of our interaction,” said Herman in an interview. “So, partnering with Asset Reality gives users a way to start an investigation to try and track down their stolen funds and possibly lead to a recovery down the line. It means there’s at least some light at the end of the tunnel.”  The average amount lost in a crypto scam is an eye-watering $25,000, according to Asset Reality, but can occasionally exceed $1 million. Part of the recovery process involves blockchain analytics (Asset Reality works with a number of crypto sleuths, including Chainalysis).  Read more: MetaMask’s Institutional Arm Makes Push for DAOs With New Custody Deals  Then there’s the more traditional heavy lifting needed to commence civil litigation, usually involving lawyers, serving information notices on exchanges and so on, said Aidan Larkin, CEO of Asset Reality. This helping hand offered to wallet users comes courtesy of MetaMask; Asset Reality is not in this to win some percentage of assets recovered, Larkin added.  Once a MetaMask user makes a report, Asset Reality carries out an initial investigation involving some blockchain analytics, which provides the user an understanding of what has happened. The recovery firm also acts as an expert witness if the user wants to be connected with a lawyer or get together into a larger class action, Larkin explained.  “This is about people being able to make that initial report and being able to pursue their case with trusted partners,” Larkin said in an interview. “We’re not saying you’re going to get your funds back tomorrow. These are civil litigation cases and very complex, but there will be those opportunities where we can identify stolen assets sitting on platforms around the world, who will collaborate and work together to legally get these assets back to the victim.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/26/metamask-has-a-plan-to-help-victims-of-crypto-scams,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ef086b18446966ac8edf22c629a6b92f11c0549-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393821,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBbWn,1653570000,How NFTs Will Drive the New Wave of Consumer Loyalty,"The staying power of cryptocurrencies and digital assets in general derives in part from their versatility. Every time I feel like I’m nearing the bottom of the barrel, someone contacts me with a new use case for crypto.  Most recently, however, it was Dan Jurek, vice president of strategic services at the Lacek Group, offering a few new spins on well-established use cases for digital assets. The Lacek Group is a loyalty marketing agency focused on driving consumer engagement for Fortune 1,000 companies.  Digital assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies are not only offering new possibilities for brands to reward loyal consumers, but they have the promise to build deeper relationships between companies and their customers.  “It feels like we’re at one of those cool milestones in our industry because this burgeoning area of crypto and the metaverse are so perfect for what we do,” said Jurek. “With so much technology, we can deliver personalized experiences based on what we know about the customers.”  Read More: Despite Recent Bumps in the Road, Stablecoins Will Stick Around  In the most simple example, Jurek says that some brands are using cryptocurrencies as payment methods for their customers, or tap digital assets to directly reward desired behavior from consumers. Other companies are leveraging blockchain technology itself to ensure the traceability, transparency and security of transactions. Still others are using NFTs for publicity and promotions.  As new layers of digital assets are developed and new applications are innovated, companies have the ability to go much deeper, said Jurek.  “We’re seeing the metaverse and Web 3.0 being used to hide promo codes, and companies are getting people to look around and earn things in the metaverse – that’s where I think there’s going to be a lot of growth,” said Jurek. “In NFTs, we see a market that is quite flooded, but it’s become the path of least resistance for companies to get involved in the space. NFTs are how brands are dipping their toes in the water.”  Jurek identified four trends that are defining how companies are using digital assets to drive consumer loyalty.  NFT auctions for a cause  “I liken it to an art auction – people can bid on NFTs, and if you’re a high bidder, you win the NFT,” said Jurek. “These have been happening for a while. The real question is what brands will do with them to make customers feel appreciated and to keep themselves top of mind, and that’s why there are NFTs for a cause. It’s like a badge of honor.”  When a brand auctions off a set of NFTs to support a cause with the proceeds, consumers can “wear” or display the NFT as if it were a “badge of honor,” said Jurek, meaning others on social media or in the metaverse can see that a person supports or is involved in a social, political or faith-based cause.  Rewards flexibility  NFTs in particular allow brands to be flexible with what they’re offering consumers, said Jurek.  For example, let’s consider two different consumers of cosmetics, Mary and Amy. Mary spends $5,000 per year on cosmetics, while Amy spends $1,000.  Read More: Why One Advisor Is Pumping the Brakes on Crypto  “Knowing that, we can differentiate the value which we offer to each of these two NFT holders and leverage it to cross-sell and upsell,” said Jurek. “So if Amy is buying certain types of moisturizer, we can give her authentic offers and experiences – maybe an exclusive experience with a favorite makeup artist. Because she holds an NFT, she might be one of only 50 people who can do that.”  Driving desired consumer behavior  “Really, what brands are doing right now is saying ‘we want you to complete this survey so we understand you better, and in return we’ll give you this NFT or cryptocurrency,’” said Jurek. “With digital assets, they can also go further – if a consumer gives us their information within 30 days, their NFT can be redeemed for ‘x’ amount of product and additional opportunity to buy things.”  In other words, digital assets can be a carrot to get people to do the things that brands want them to do.  Speaking of digital carrots …  NFT redemption options  Brands can allow NFTs to be redeemed for concert experiences, meetings, access to content or access to products. But in the future consumers will have a lot more options for how they dispose of their NFTs.  While NFTs are non-fungible, they can still change hands just like any other digital asset, and the secondary market for NFTs is still in its infancy. So let’s say Amy, from our cosmetics example, doesn’t really want her exclusive experience with a makeup artist – she can put her NFT on the secondary market and trade it for crypto, cash or another NFT offering a similarly valued experience.  “This is going to open up a world of different options for people,” said Jurek. “Let’s say I’ve been rewarded a trip to Hawaii through a points program, but I don’t want to go to Hawaii. I can trade it to you for your trip to Belize across a secondary marketplace like Baakt. We’re going to see a lot more peer-to-peer commerce than has happened in the past.""  What it means for financial advice  The proliferation of blockchain- and digital asset-based rewards programs has a few implications for financial advisors. For one thing, advisors need to be prepared to provide counsel on how rewards can and should be redeemed, and they should be comfortable discussing potential transactions on a secondary NFT marketplace. Advisors should also be prepared to vet NFT auctions for a cause and contrast them with other, more traditional giving experiences.  For another, the financial industry may want to adopt some of the behavioral-nudging techniques of the larger brand universe to instill better financial behaviors in their clients. This might include offering “digital carrots” for good saving, spending and investing behavior and offering NFT rewards to loyal clients giving them access to social experiences.  By embracing consumer rewards driven by digital assets, human advisors may find ways to catch up with the behavioral engineering already embraced by digital investment applications, such as Robinhood and Betterment, and create wealthier, happier and more satisfied clients.

42421580,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeWz,1653569400,"For Financial Advisors, Bitcoin Is the Next Nasdaq","Financial advisors like to talk about how bitcoin (BTC) is just a substitute for the Nasdaq because of its price volatility and high correlation to stocks.  They are more right than they know, but for the wrong reasons. In the 2020s, bitcoin will likely prove to be the driver of investment returns in investors' portfolios, just as the top Nasdaq-listed companies were in the prior decade. Financial advisors had better position their clients accordingly.  Upgrading bitcoin from Amazon to Nasdaq  In late 2020, I argued that bitcoin was the next Amazon. So much has changed since then that this view needs revision. While I still think that bitcoin's future percentage returns are on the same scale as Amazon's (AMZN) were over a decade ago, framing bitcoin's investment potential today in terms of a single company is now too limiting.  Today a better analogy is the elite members of the Nasdaq. At over $20 trillion of total market capitalization, this index (and its primary constituents) were the primary creator of wealth for stock investors in the decade that ended last year. The top seven companies in the index – Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (Google) (GOOG), Amazon, Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta (Facebook) (FB) – accumulated approximately $11 trillion of total value, roughly $10 trillion (i.e., 90%) of which was generated in the last decade.  Read More: What Does It Mean to Truly Adopt Bitcoin?  But circumstances have changed for this extraordinarily successful group of companies. They face rising hurdles, especially (1) regulation and (2) rising inflation (and therefore interest rates).  Regulatory hurdles for the Nasdaq darlings  Prior to the U.S. election in November 2020, I opined that the regulatory risk to bitcoin was already lower than the regulatory risk to the giants of the Nasdaq. Public opinion had already turned against these titans of the data industry, fueled by concerns about election tampering and manipulation. Terms like ""surveillance capitalism"" entered the vernacular.  Congress was increasing its scrutiny of the industry as the public realized that these companies swindle us by  giving us services with almost zero marginal costs to produce that are worth far less than the data we feed them.  destroying our privacy by hoovering up our data and selling it to third parties.  effectively hacking the primitive portion of our brains by providing serotonin hits for “likes” and interactions that are addictive in nature and make us unhappier overall.  reducing our ability to concentrate and reason due to such constant stimulation.  creating polarizing and hatred-cultivating echo chambers.  spreading misinformation that can result in the weakening of democracy.  turning journalism into a clickbait-driven business model.  possibly even destroying jobs and livelihoods by accelerating the rate of automation in the American economy.  That was before the appointment of a competition regulator who seems keen on reigning in the internet monopolists and intensifying moves by European regulators who were already on the same path. Suffice it to say that the uphill regulatory path for the elite members of the Nasdaq has steepened further, which makes it less likely that they will repeat the 10x return in this decade that they achieved in the last one.  Read More: Where Should Advisors Go for Crypto Education?  The great inflation of the 2020s  To understand bitcoin's importance for the coming decade, start with inflation. Inflation is impossible to predict since it incorporates a large social and psychological component. It can take time for the crowd to change its expectations for the future, demand higher wages today, negotiate to lock in future wage rises and complete the inflationary wage/price spiral.  But there are plenty of inflationary drivers that don't depend on unpredictable human psychology, and these factors are screaming for sustained higher inflation. The following are a few of the biggest inflationary factors:  Deglobalization (re-shoring of supply chains) due to the pandemic and rising geopolitical conflict among great powers (most recently manifested in the Ukraine war) reduces global access to both inexpensive commodities and cheap labor. This raises overall production costs for goods and services.  Domestic labor pool shrinkage due to the boomers (second largest generation in history) exiting the workforce cannot be offset by new labor force entrants because Generation Y is so much smaller. This raises overall production costs for goods and services. The overall demographic picture globally is similar. Falling birth rates in the last few decades have created smaller and smaller cohorts of young adults entering the workforce. Less labor means higher inflation.  Elevated government deficit spending due to numerous factors, including payment of entitlements, necessitates greater government borrowing and monetization of government debt. This increases the quantity of money chasing goods and services.  Because of these inflationary drivers, smart analysts of the 2020s have drawn comparisons to both the 1940s and the 1970s. Both were periods of high consumer price inflation in which consumer price inflation significantly outstripped interest rates, which helped the economy manage its debt. Moreover, today the total debt level as a percent of total economic output is much higher than in either of those periods, which makes the potential inflation all the more appealing.  In the 1940s, gold ownership for investment purposes was prohibited. That didn't stop many Americans from owning it and protecting their purchasing power. In the 1970s, gold was the single best-performing major asset. Gold investors made approximately 30% annualized. By contrast, stocks returned just 5% annualized. With inflation averaging over 7% annually, stocks lost at least 2% of their purchasing power per year in that decade. Bonds lost 4% annually in real terms.  This brings us to digital gold, aka bitcoin. With roughly $600 billion of total network value, bitcoin has approximately the value (in nominal terms) of the sum total of the top seven members of the Nasdaq a decade ago. And bitcoin could easily accrue another $10 trillion of value this decade like those companies did in the prior one.  The Nasdaq had a great run last decade. Recent price action suggests that may be ending. Bitcoin's price has also had a rough ride recently. But given that bitcoin is the hardest monetary asset ever invented, and the forces of inflation seem likely to endure, I expect bitcoin to be the must-own asset of the 2020s.

Global factors have led cryptocurrencies and other riskier assets to come under pressure and sustain depreciation. Bitcoin hit a high of $67,729 at the end of last year, showing 3.4% growth over the past five years. However, 2022 has taken its toll on those gains. Although analysts raised $30,000 as a key threshold, the fall of the main electronic currency dragged down the crypto universe along with crypto investors, leading to a crypto crash.

The price dip followed a relatively positive market response to Wednesday's release of minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting held on May 3-4. The S&P 500 added nearly 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day 1.91% higher. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 and Germany’s DAX both gained about 0.4% on Thursday.  The minutes showed the agency was willing to be flexible on plans to increase rates and tighten monetary policy. Previously, Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed would take an “aggressive” stance – which traders feared would lead to inflation.  The Fed raised the official U.S. interest rate by half a percentage point earlier in May. It plans to reduce the size of its balance sheet by $47.5 billion a month for three months and up to $95 billion a month starting in September, as previously reported.  “Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing,” Powell said at the time. “We’re moving expeditiously to bring it back down.” At the time, the comments contributed to a fall in broader markets and spread to crypto.  U.S. inflation has surged to its highest in four decades and is closely tracked by bitcoin (BTC) traders because the asset seen by many as a hedge against rising consumer prices.  Bitcoin, however, remains bearish. It has lost value for each of the the past eight weeks – a first in its history – while futures and options data indicate traders are positioning for a further drop.  An indicator tracking portfolio hedge reached a 12-month high this week, while yields on a popular trade involving bitcoin and ether (ETH) fell to lows.  Expect volatility ahead  Some analysts say bitcoin’s current range between $29,000 to $30,000 could be breached in coming weeks and the asset could become more volatile.  “We caution that this current reduction in volatility risks turning into an explosion in the near term, potentially setting off momentum for a few days or weeks,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, a market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk.  “A formal break of consolidation beyond the previous local extremes, which are located at $30,200 and $29,300, in a sharp move would trigger a wave of liquidation of positions,” Kuptsikevich said. Liquidations typically cause sudden movement of prices as traders cover their positions to protect against losses.  Other observers say the range is part of consolidation in the broader market.  “Following the crypto industry-wide sell-off with the demise of the LUNA network last week, markets have entered a period of consolidation,” said Will Hamilton, a trader at crypto fund Trovio, in a note to CoinDesk.  “Rotation has continued within the stablecoin market as a further $1Bn in USDT redemptions has been absorbed by USDC and BUSD,” Hamilton said, suggesting traders are not entirely exiting the crypto market.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/26/bitcoin-sees-weakness-at-29k-as-traders-assess-fed-minutes,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Yield Guild Games and Merit Circle offer play-to-earn gamers so-called scholarships. Gamers, often in developing countries, can borrow the non-fungible token (NFT) that acts as an entrance fee for the game. In exchange, the player has to send back a cut of the in-game earnings.  In October, YGG invested $175,000 in Merit Circle to expand its scholarship program. But a number of key members of the Merit Circle DAO deem this investment to be insufficient from a value-added perspective.  Many Merit Circle DAO members expected YGG to introduce further investors and provide social media coverage.  “Unfortunately, we were also disappointed with YGG’s response, as it demonstrates how little value they have added over the past [seven] months,” wrote DAO member and investor Sad Cat Capital. “As a VC firm ourselves, we take pride in the activism we do for projects that we love.”  YGG says the agreement between the two DAOs was an exchange of tokens for capital, and no part of the agreement called for “value-add” services.  All of this highlights a key challenge in the viability of DAOs: As leaderless organizations governed by their members, they are vulnerable to the political whims of stakeholders, who may think they have more control over the DAO than the incorporated, real-world arm of the DAO.  Although many members of the DAO have strong feelings about the role YGG should play, the investment contract was signed by Merit Circle Ltd., the Gibraltar-incorporated counterpart of the DAO, which is controlled by executives of Merit Circle and early investors.  While the DAO members can put forward an improvement proposal on which to vote, it’s not known if the signed agreement has a clause to cancel and refund the investment, thus making any proposal of this nature non-binding.  YGG’s token (YGG) is currently trading for 68 U.S. cents, according to CoinGecko, down 62% on-month. Merit Circle’s token (MC) is at $1.10, and has also faced strong market headwinds, dropping 44% in the last 30 days.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/26/gaming-dao-merit-circle-and-ygg-caught-in-dao-governance-strife,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f0bcc0e45fa7087af3a92785ef542bd2ffed3ed-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Old Fashion Research (OFR) was formed by Ling Zhang and Wayne Fu, previously Binance's vice president of M&A and head of corporate development respectively.  The fund, backed by traditional venture capital funds, family offices and angel investors, will focus on the metaverse and crypto adoption in emerging markets.  ""We see a greater potential of crypto adoption in markets where people are still struggling from the underdeveloped finance and banking system,"" an OFR spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""We also see the potential of crypto to further change people's life and work style after seeing the fast growth in Southeast Asia markets.""  The fund, whose name was inspired by the Old Fashioned cocktail, according to the fund's website, has already invested in over 50 blockchain projects. These include blockchain analytics platform Nansen, trading platform WOO Network and African gaming community Metaverse Magna.  Despite the troubling conditions of the crypto markets in recent weeks and months, venture capital does not appear to have been overly spooked.

42374628,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1ZLv,1653555048,"Solana, Dogecoin Tokens Dip as Futures Suggests Bearish Sentiment","Tokens of the Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) protocols dipped the most among the major cryptocurrencies even as bitcoin (BTC) remained mostly unchanged over the past 24 hours.  SOL lost as much as 8% amid a continual “risk-off” sentiment for major cryptocurrencies. DOGE dropped 5%, while BNB Chain’s BNB, Cardano’s ADA, and XRP slid a relatively lesser 3.5%, data on CoinGecko showed.  Outside of the top ten, Avalanche’s AVAX slid 11%, while Shiba Inu’s SHIB lost just 2.5% despite being a relatively more volatile token. Ether (ETH) lost 3.2% amid falling demand for block space on Ethereum, suggesting lower development and on-chain activity.  Block space is the amount of transactional data that can be included in each block, with users paying ""gas"" fees for doing so. Lower block demand generally means a fall in user activity on any particular network.  Further downside  On-chain analytics firm Glassnode said in a note earlier this week that derivatives market suggested fear of further downside remains among investors.  “Poor price performance, fearful derivatives pricing, and exceedingly lackluster demand for block-space on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, we can deduce that the demand side is likely to continue seeing headwinds,” Glassnode said.  Yields on a three-month rolling basis for futures hover over around 3.1% for both assets, which “is historically very low,” Glassnode said. Such yields are generated when there is mispricing between an asset’s spot and futures price. Traders go long on the underlying asset and short its, or a related asset’s, futures. The difference is pocketed.  However, lower yields give traders little reason to deploy capital and enter markets, which could mean further downside as new capital fails to bid up spot, and futures, prices. The capital could re-enter if broader markets provide low returns.  “[Yield] is now higher than the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield of 2.78%, which may start giving investor capital a reason to re-enter the space,” Glassnode analysts said.  The bearish futures data came alongside options activity on bitcoin that suggested a bearish sentiment among traders, as reported earlier this week. The put/call ratio on bitcoin options reached 12-month-highs of over 0.72, indicating traders were hedging their portfolios against a move downwards.  Put options are a contract that gives the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a given price. Call options, on the hand, allow call buyers to purchase the asset at a predetermined price in the future.  The put/call ratio is a measure of puts against calls, which indicates how traders are positioning for a market move.  Current conditions remain bearish, however. Bitcoin has spent the past week trading within a tight range between $28,700 and $30,500 and has printed over eight consecutive weeks of downside for the first time in its trading history.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOGE | SOL,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/26/solana-dogecoin-tokens-dip-as-futures-suggests-bearish-sentiment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bbc180894c65ba5f41a30ba653bb90e758a9495c-612x414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A [Haipo Yang]: I had my first introduction to Bitcoin and open-source software around 2011. At the time, fascinated by the technical principles of Bitcoin, I supported the view that we should facilitate industrywide progress by lowering the threshold of tech development via open-source coding. This led me to blockchain technology and the blockchain industry. Later on, I started to have some insights into the blockchain space. Back in 2013, I started running Bitcoin nodes and joined the building of the Bitcoin community. In March 2016, I completed all the code of ViaBTC Pool on my own in two months. At the time, the inception of ViaBTC was motivated by factors relating to technology and product. Back then, the blockchain industry was in its infancy, and many technologies and products, including mining pools, were immature.

With the possibility of digital currencies replacing paper money, several countries are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). That is setting the stage for stablecoins vs CBDCs. Are CBDCs prospects doomed from the word go? Read on to find out. What Are Stablecoins and CBDCs? A CBDC is simply a digital currency issued by a central bank. Such coins are inspired by the concepts behind cryptos but differ in the sense that a central arbitrator or the state issues them. As such, there is no need for a distributed ledger like the blockchain. They&apos;re also called digital fiat. On the other hand, stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose price lacks the high volatility generally associated with cryptos. To achieve price stability, stablecoins are pegged to a fiat currency such as the US dollar to achieve price stability. They will most often have a reserve asset held to maintain the pegged value, preferably of equal worth to its market cap. Details on CBDCs There are two types of CBDCs- wholesale CBDCs and Retail CBDCs. Wholesale CBDCs function similarly to bank reserves held in the Central bank. All financial institutions within an economy operate an account with the central bank in which funds are deposited to settle interbank transactions.

""We have no plans to file a contempt of court challenge,"" a spokesperson of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) told CoinDesk regarding Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong raising the idea of a legal move against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  Armstrong's tweet  The Coinbase CEO sowed the seed of a Supreme Court challenge by tweeting to ask if the RBI's ""shadow ban"" – in which payment processors cut off local crypto exchanges – was a violation of a 2020 Supreme Court ruling. His tweet came following his company's ill-fated India launch, which led to Coinbase exiting the country days later. Armstrong later pointed to ""informal pressure"" from the RBI as reason for the exit.  ""I would not like to comment on speculative observations made by individuals outside,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das later said in an interview with CNBC TV 18.  Beginning in 2018, the RBI had effectively banned banks through a notification from supporting or engaging in crypto transactions. The Supreme Court, however, overturned that rule early in 2020.  Procedural hurdles  Procedurally, legal sources say a contempt of court challenge is technically best filed by the original petitioner in the Supreme Court, which in this case would be the IAMAI. If it is not the original petitioner, then an individual entity seeking to file a contempt of court is required to first prove how it is an aggrieved party to the case. This itself is a tricky procedural hurdle.  Sources have indicated divergent views regarding the IAMAI's position. While no difference of opinion exists between major players on the collective decision of the IAMAI to avoid a legal battle against the RBI, there are less-influential players who believe a legal challenge is the best way forward.  At least one person has indicated that, legally, all the ducks are in a row to file a contempt of court challenge – which includes funding and legal process approvals – but, for now, the industry body (IAMAI) is unequivocally against the idea.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/26/after-armstrong-tweet-indias-crypto-policy-body-says-no-contempt-of-court-challenge-vs-rbi,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The platform works as a Layer 0 ecosystem with an advanced central ledger known as the Relay Chain. Surrounding the Relay Chain are parachains, a group of diverse blockchains tied to Polkadot. In essence, parachains run as parallel blockchains that can interact with each other. The following piece intends to highlight the most prominent parachains features. Parachains Definition and Features Parachains represent independent blockchains that share Polkadot&apos;s governance, security, and scalability. The networks operate within one ecosystem and have a trustless communication system. Some of the well-known parachains features include: Scalability Scalability refers to a network&apos;s ability to handle a growing number of transactions. The performance of a blockchain is mainly determined by the average time it takes to verify transactions. As such, without any scaling solution, blockchains can become overloaded with numerous transactions. This event also attracts higher transaction fees to users. Parachains offer scalable networks where multiple blockchains can communicate with each other. Transaction processes in the parachains operate in a parallel manner. Therefore, transactions are spread across various chains to avoid bottlenecks that could slow down a network.
