42405789,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeodK2,1611871709,Cosmos Set to Take Lead in Blockchain Interoperability With February's Stargate Release,"Right now, blockchains communicate via tacked-on solutions (state channels, sidechains, swaps, bridges and so on). With the Stargate update to Cosmos on Feb. 18, the tools for native blockchain interoperability will be live on mainnet.      ""This is a long-awaited release for many Cosmos-based projects out there,"" Band Protocol’s Kevin Lu told CoinDesk via email. ""For us this will enable seamless and simple integrations with any Cosmos-based decentralized application, relaying oracle data in a highly scalable and tamper-proof manner.""      Iqlusion's Zaki Manian, who leads much of the development for Cosmos, explained that once Stargate goes live, a governance vote will be required to switch on inter-blockchain communication (IBC), which will take two weeks to finalize.      So at the earliest, all systems go for IBC would be early March. That said, Tendermint chains need to upgrade to the Cosmos SDK for this to happen. Manian said this is probably one or two weeks of work for most dev teams and they don't need to wait for Stargate to kick in to start.    Read more: ‘One Network, Many Chains’ – The Case for Blockchain Interoperability    If Tendermint-based chains activate Stargate en masse, this has the potential to be a big moment – not just for Cosmos but in the whole history of crypto.      There have been a lot of standalone bridges between blockchains built so far, but Stargate could mark a new era in composability, where we see one big system that lets lots of different chains trade value and build on each other's strengths.    Many chains    There are more notable Tendermint-based projects than many may realize.      A new site called Cosmos-Cap is tracking the market capitalization of projects in the ecosystem, currently valuing all the chains together at just under $13 billion. The native token of Cosmos, ATOM, is currently trading around $8, with a market cap of $1.9 billion on its own.      Cosmos-Cap shows (among others) the Binance Chain, the stablecoin system Terra, the aforementioned oracle project Band, the privacy blockchain Oasis and the MakerDAO-like collateralized debt platform Kava.      While not on that list, the payments and remittances blockchain Celo has also taken steps to connect with Stargate.      THORChain, which enables assets to be swapped across chains (sort of like Uniswap), told CoinDesk, ""THORChain is Stargate-ready, but more work needs to be done to make it IBC-ready, that is in the works currently.""      Other teams are also busy.      ""The current plan for Band Protocol's Stargate connection is to have testnet by Q1 and mainnet by Q2 for Stargate support,"" Lu wrote, enabling the team time to be very confident in its implementation.      Do Kwon, a co-founder of Terraform Labs, which runs the Terra chain, confirmed it would upgrade but not until Stargate has had some time in the wild. ""The earliest we would move to upgrade is May,"" he wrote in an email.      Spokespeople for Celo and Oasis confirmed the teams are working toward IBC implementation, but without giving a timeline.    Read more: Cosmos and the Dream of Anti-Maximalism    Binance, whose BNB coin represents the most value in the ecosystem, sent CoinDesk the following statement: “We will not be able to join the Stargate timeline to support the IBC. The Binance Chain community will discuss when and how to support this initiative.”      THORChain also emphasized that, like many big upgrades, Stargate will add other benefits for Tendermint-based blockchains, such as faster throughput and implementation of Google's protocol buffers standard (which should also be good for interoperability).      Close followers of the project may have heard Stargate would launch on Jan. 28, but the date was pushed back. Manian told CoinDesk this decision was driven by a bug that was found and fixed. It was useful anyway because the exchanges still were not ready for the update.      Since 2019, the Cosmos project has been as volatile as cryptocurrency generally.      While in late 2019 CoinDesk noted the financial health of the project thanks to conservative treasury management, by early 2020 it appeared to be falling apart from a personnel standpoint. By the summer, however, it seemed Cosmos had weathered its internal storms.      Going forward, every time a blockchain clicks into IBC it is likely to put pressure on other Tendermint projects to get their upgrades done. With even a few interoperating, composability should start kicking in and FOMO will drive stragglers to get in fast.      It could get very interesting; while Ethereum tests its Beacon Chain, Cosmos will have something very similar to a sharded system running on mainnet, tossing value back and forth at will.",POSITIVE,ATOM | BNB,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | LUNA | BNB,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/28/cosmos-set-to-take-lead-in-blockchain-interoperability-with-februarys-stargate-release,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f6a3a8871cb64ad17cefdf06000f2326e23c883-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42405796,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeodRu,1611871686,US Congress Plans Hearings on GameStop Market Pumps,"Congress plans to hold hearings on short sellers, digital trading platforms and WallStreetBets pumping GameStop stock 25-fold.      The price of GameStop ($GME) stock nearly hit $500 per share on Thursday, after a week of meteoric rises instigated by users of the WallStreetBets community on Reddit and bolstered by other retail traders.      These everyday traders forced a GME short-seller to close its position and accept a loss of billions of dollars, suggesting that Wall Street doesn’t quite have a monopoly on controlling the stock market. On Thursday, Robinhood and other retail trading platforms suspended purchases of GameStop, as well as AMC and other shares pumped by WallStreetBets in recent days.      The question now is how the U.S. government will react. As of Thursday afternoon, multiple lawmakers were planning hearings around the situation.      Both the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee announced there would be hearings on short-selling and online trading platforms, though dates have not been announced.      Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the House committee, said in a statement that hedge funds “have a long history of predatory conduct” that she called indefensible.      “As a first step in reining in these abusive practices, I will convene a hearing to examine the recent activity around GameStop stock and other impacted stocks with a focus on short selling, online trading platforms, gamification and their systemic impact on our capital markets and retail investors,” she said.    Read more: WallStreetBets Reddit Group: What Is It?    She added that hedge funds must be dealt with, though she does not appear to be looking at the WallStreetBets users or other retail investors who pumped a number of stocks to sky-high prices.      Details weren’t immediately available for the Senate committee hearing.    Regulatory response    Financial regulators might be less well-equipped to respond to the trading or the suspensions.      Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino reported the SEC is planning to investigate whether Reddit commenters manipulated the stock market in pumping GameStop and other company share prices. However, it’s unclear what these regulators could actually do.      One attorney with experience in the securities markets, who requested anonymity due to the lack of clarity around the issue, told CoinDesk that the SEC doesn’t have much leeway in this situation.      “What are they going to do? Prevent people from having chatrooms on a social media site? This isn’t even a pump and dump, because a pump and dump is a centralized effort by a handful of parties to move a stock,” the attorney said. “This is an effort by an entire community, by hundreds of people or perhaps thousands of people who are putting in a couple dollars here and there, and it works.”    Read more: GameStop and the Real Market Manipulators    CoinDesk reached out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The FTC declined to comment. The CFPB referred CoinDesk to the SEC, which also declined to comment.      White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki referred reporters to an SEC statement about monitoring the situation during a press briefing Thursday.      Asked if President Joe Biden or his administration was looking at Robinhood’s actions, Psaki said, “He's briefed by his economic team frequently but we don't have anything more for you … I don’t have anything more for you on this.”      New York Attorney General Letitia James also announced her office would also be reviewing Robinhood's actions on Thursday.

42405800,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeodWp,1611870181,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Reverses Wednesday’s Losses, Ether Climbs","Bitcoin’s price reversed Wednesday’s losses on Thursday. Traders and analysts, however, have largely kept a short-term bearish view because some are attributing gains in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to GameStop’s stock drama.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $32,607.78 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 3.17% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $29,921.96-$32,934.56 (CoinDesk 20).  BTC above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    GameStop’s stock drama seems to be galvanizing not just stock markets but bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, many of which reversed their losses of just a day ago, similar to what happened in the U.S. equities market. The most notable winner was dogecoin (DOGE), which hit a new all-time high earlier Thursday.      Few attribute bitcoin’s price gains Thursday to market fundamentals. That’s because the crypto community still looks to be distracted by the GameStop (NYSE: GME) situation. A group of Redditors on a board called WallStreetBets (WSB) sent the video game retailer’s shares skyrocketing in order to squeeze hedge funds that were betting the stock's price would go down.      Read More: Bitcoin Rebounds From Early Losses, Markets Still Distracted by GameStop      “We are still on a downward chart from the $40,000 highs,” John Willock, chief executive at digital asset exchange Blocktane, told CoinDesk. “So the short-term volatility of up to 10% can be attributed to the market still finding its footing and consolidating to a more firm, sustained price level for the near future.”      On the technical side, bitcoin is near short-term oversold levels, yet momentum is still on the downside, according to Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies.      “After a period of stabilization, the 50-day moving average (MA) looks in store for a test, and currently resides near $26,460,” said Stockton. “Bitcoin has characteristics of a risk asset, and therein could remain under pressure until the equity market works off its own excesses.”      Retailer traders’ fear of missing out (FOMO) may be the big driver of both equity and crypto markets at the moment, but it isn't clear if new institutional investors are buying more bitcoin, which could affect its price.      As CoinDesk reported previously, many institutions may be pausing bitcoin purchases until they have further clarification on how the new Biden Administration views bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.      Read More: Bitcoin Falls as Miners Sell, Institutions Watch Yellen      While some negative comments were made by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week, there hasn’t been any big statement from anyone else in the administration regarding bitcoin. To some, that is a positive sign.      “The Biden administration has paused processing the much-discussed and disliked proposed rule for U.S.-based crypto service providers that would stifle trading and asset transfers, which is improving sentiment and prospects for a market lift,” Blocktane’s Willock said.      Willock also noted on Friday the CME’s January bitcoin futures contracts expire. That exchange caters primarily to institutional investors, so many of its clients will likely be adjusting their positions after a “very volatile” first month of 2021 and will decide whether they need to take profits or reduce exposure.    Ether follows positive trends from bitcoin, DeFi    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Thursday, trading around $1,332.19 and climbing 3.37% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Like most of the other cryptocurrencies, ether’s price has followed bitcoin’s recovery, according to Vishal Shah, an option trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. Another main driver is the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi).      “Blue-chip DeFi names have been performing quite well,” Shah said. “Ether still remains a proxy for that world.”      At press time, most DeFi tokens on Messari’s DeFi Asset tracker are higher. At the same time, the total value locked (TVL), as provided by analytics website DeFi Pulse, was at $26.4 billion for the past 90 days. On Wednesday TVL was at a high of $29 billion for the past 12 months, again according to DeFi Pulse data.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly higher Thursday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    0x (ZRX) + 17.49%  Cosmos (ATOM) + 14.38%  Stellar (XLM) + 13.15%    Notable losers:    Tether (USDT) - 0.09%  USD coin (USDC) - 0.08%    Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 closed in the red 1.5% as a result of the U.S. stock market’s loss on Wednesday.  The FTSE 100 in Europe closed down by 0.63% also because of the volatility on Wall Street.  The S&P 500 in the United States closed up by 0.98%, which was partly driven by better-than-expected earnings reports from companies such as American Airlines Group.    Commodities:    Oil was down 1.1%. Price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude: $52.27.  Gold was in the green 0.03% and at $1842.15 as of press time.

42405788,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeodG6,1611863643,US Government Takes Aim at NetWalker Ransomware Attacks,"Federal prosecutors struck back at a favorite tool of the ransomware community Wednesday, indicting one alleged NetWalker user, a Canadian national named Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, on wire fraud, hacking and network extortion charges, and coordinating the takedown of a victim guidebook hosted on the darkweb.      The action, which included assistance from Bulgarian authorities, is the U.S. government's first public assault against a malicious software that's booming in popularity. Ransoms against schools, hospitals, businesses and governments netted NetWalker attackers tens of millions of dollars in 2020.      NetWalker burrows into and encrypts victim computers, only releasing its hold once victims pay a ransom - usually in bitcoin. It follows the ransomware-as-a-service model, making the individual hackers (affiliates) who deploy the attack lock down the computer and demand the ransom akin to franchisees who share their profits with corporate (the ransomware developer).      Read more: NetWalker Ransomware Gang Is Storing $7M in Bitcoin in SegWit Cold Storage      Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins is alleged to have been one such affiliate. Prosecutors said he held a Florida-based company's computers hostage with NetWalker in violation of federal law. Prosecutors also demanded forfeiture of $27 million accrued through his alleged ransomware crimes.      Vachon-Desjardins mounted at least 91 NetWalker heists from April 2020 onward, blockchain tracing company Chainalysis said, citing government partners. In a Wednesday blog post the firm said Vacho-Desjardins' associated wallet addresses have allegedly banked more than $14 million in bitcoin since February 2018, a trove now worth $27 million.      Chainalysis CSO Jonathan Levin told CoinDesk Vachon-Desjardins' transactions offer a window into the workings of the underground ransomware economy. Chainalysis has followed $46 million in illicit ransomware bitcoin flows since 2019.      ""The transparency of the blockchain really enables you to see not only the affiliates that are dealing with NetWalker, but also the affiliates that are actually using the other ransomware-as-a service strains. So we can see links between different ransomware strains via common affiliates of the different strains,"" he said.

42405795,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeodQv,1611861397,GameStop and the Real Market Manipulators,"What does it mean for a market to be manipulated?      I know there are legal answers to this question, but that’s not really what I’m interested in. I am more interested in where and how we, as the blood-thirsty capitalist society that we are, draw the line between the market being the market and the market being manipulated.    Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.    There are a few ways to think about the answer to this question. There is the free market libertarian answer, which says that whatever the market is doing must be right. There is the fundamentals, rules-driven approach, which says the market will always (eventually) revert back to reasonable multiples of the metrics that textbooks and professors have deemed to matter. And then there is the democratic approach, which says the wisdom of the crowd ought to prevail. I am not sure that we should call it wisdom, but this week the crowd certainly prevailed.      The enormous rally in GameStop equity (and the corresponding pain felt by certain hedge funds which were short the stock) represented a coup de grace for retail investors in a battle that has been waging for years.      Several phenomena have been working synergistically to bring retail traders en masse into the markets. There have been the trends that have been playing out for years: increased accessibility, thanks to entrants like Robinhood; the rise of influencer culture, in which one or a few individuals can mobilize their digital followings; ongoing disillusionment with the establishment, a theme that dates back at least to the 2008 crisis; and the internet-driven narrowing of the gap between expert and amateur that has occurred across all fields over the last decades.      Then there have been the catalysts specific to this past year. 2020 saw sports betting close down and casinos shutter. It saw a single-day stock market drawdown that forced many to question what they were doing with their 401(k)s, if not their lives, followed by an incredible rally in the face of dismal economic realities. It was the year of being forced indoors and onto screens. It is no wonder that last year smashed all records of new retail brokerage account openings.      The flood of retail investors and retail dollars has generated a new set of tensions. This came to a head this week in the coordinated buying of GameStop stock and call options by retail investors coordinated on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets.      The remarkable moves in the stock market on the back of this forum have produced two camps. There are those who say these retail traders are colluding to manipulate the market and force these stocks to territory in which they have no business being (see also: Tesla). Subscribers of this view seem to be mostly Wall Street natives and the surrounding media outlets.      Then there are those who say the markets were already manipulated, in particular by the hedge funds who had put on artificially large short positions to begin with and had not appropriately managed their risk. Those in this camp tend to ask: Why shouldn’t retail traders be allowed to do this?      Why shouldn’t they indeed? After all, if it was another hedge fund executing this trade and short squeezing the market, it would just be another day on Wall Street. That the adversary here is a sort of decentralized swarm of retail traders is what makes the phenomenon both remarkable and controversial. And it highlights a double standard.    Markets are not actually free.    The trading floor, as I once knew it, was not all that different from the WallStreetBets Discord chat. It was a place of stress, euphoria, arguments, cooperation, laughter, name-calling, insights, inappropriate remarks and banter. It also had the same clubby, in-group feel that online communities often develop. Those who worked there had nicknames, jargon and their own way of talking about things.      Think of the portrayal of trading desks in every bit of media you have ever consumed. The people pounding desks and putting their fists through screens; the bosses swinging baseball bats around; the rolled up sleeves and dilated pupils; the obscenities. When Yale-educated men in button-downs engage in these behaviors, they become the Masters of the Universe. Yet, when anonymous online avatars and energetic YouTube personalities do so they are cast as immature, basement-dwelling kids.      The double standard at play here extends beyond the conduct and deportment of these two groups. It also extends to their methods of engagement in the markets. When hedge fund managers get together and share insights and ideas, it is all in the name of moving towards a more efficient free market. Yet, when the online mob of retail traders comes to consensus about which stock is worth buying, they are considered by some to be artificially pumping the name and manipulating the market.      So, are they manipulating the market? Again, the situations of this past week highlight just how strange this question has become. In some ways, one cannot participate in the market without manipulating it. The very act of buying and selling is, in some way, manipulation. There are of course more extreme forms of it: painting the tape, spoofing, pumping and dumping.      Generally, but not always, these involve some level of privileged access – either to the market at hand or to the infrastructure of the market. This is part of what makes the accusations of retail manipulating the market comical. These traders came to the fight armed only with the Reddit forum and their Robinhood accounts.      See also: Preston Byrne – ‘The Squeezening’: How the GameStop Backlash Will Curtail Freedom      This is the problem with thinking that whatever the market is doing must be right. Market participants are not equally equipped as they walk into the market to do battle. Markets are not actually free, meaning they are distorted away from theoretically optimal pricing. The realities that certain players have access to more capital, more leverage and more financial instruments to express their views render the markets manipulated by default.      It is worth noting that the GameStop phenomenon would not have been successful for these retail traders without the power of options and leverage. It is often said that Robinhood is democratizing trading. It is also democratizing access to these powerful market tools, leveling the playing field in a way that hadn’t been done before.      This brings us to another double standard. Much has been made of the dangers Robinhood poses for its retail customers. People should not be allowed to trade with leverage, the wisdom goes. They do not know what they are doing and they will get hurt. In this situation, however, it appears that it was a certain institutional hedge fund that did not know what it was doing and got hurt. Of course, for institutions the world provides crash pads and government-funded bailouts. For retail, this is not a possibility. And so the only way forward we offer is the old wisdom: Don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose. Just put your money in an index fund. Stay out of the markets if you do not understand them.      But the rules are changing. Who doesn’t understand the markets now?",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/28/gamestop-and-the-real-market-manipulators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00f0b37cb97a36571427a266463dbe32f4744279-1996x1330.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Moderating a virtual World Economic Forum (WEF) panel on the impact of CBDCs, CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey asked what the plan is for the digital yuan in terms of how it fits into China's international strategy.      The future of the digital yuan will largely be decided by the market, said Zhu Min, chairman of China’s National Institute of Financial Research, pointing to the influence of payment systems, capital flows and currency exchange.      “Also, I think it depends on the countries and governments' agreements,” said Zhu. “So, let's say if Singapore was willing to have the Chinese digital currency moving to Singapore and China was willing to accept the Singapore digital currency, maybe the two countries can sign a deal to work on those things.”    Read more: World Economic Forum Wants to Standardize Ethical Data Collection    On the subject of the internationalization of the renminbi and giving it a great role in commerce, Casey asked if a digital yuan would give China a better opportunity to compete with the U.S. dollar’s primacy as a global reserve currency.      “Firstly, I don’t think there is a plan,” said Zhu, a former deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China. “Second, I don’t think we are going to use an instrument to compete with the dollar. I don’t think the [CBDC] is moving in that direction.”      Those promoting the idea of a digital dollar, such as former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Christopher Giancarlo, have pointed to privacy concerns around a Chinese digital currency. So would this be a viable concern in the context of interoperable, cross-border arrangements?      “I really don’t see that as a big issue,” said Zhu. “Obviously, if you go one step backwards, the internal architecture and also the technical networking paths can be very different. So those issues need to be solved when the market gradually develops.”    Sovereign risk    Also on the WEF panel, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said payment systems demonstrate how international central banks and regulators are actively collaborating.      “By comparison with some other aspects of international affairs, this area is actually working fairly well,” said Shanmugaratnam.      A problem from the traditional world that lingers over these discussions, however, is the risk that some small and emerging countries face around the “dollarization of their economies,” he added.      “Whenever there is a hint of sovereign risk or worries about a central bank, people start switching into dollars,” Shanmugaratnam said. “That traditional risk will become much more pronounced if you have a digital currency, because it will be that much cheaper and faster to switch from domestic currency assets into foreign currency assets.

The year-long grant is worth $96,000, payable in bitcoin.      Previously, Bitmain funded Schnelli’s work before nixing his and other's grants last year, something Marathon Patent Group highlighted in its correspondence with CoinDesk.      “Bitmain cancelled all of their funding for [Schnelli and other developers]...which left Jonas seeking a new grant,” Merrick Okamoto, Marathon’s chairman and CEO, told CoinDesk.      ""It feels amazing that the community has each others' back. I sent a single tweet (that I lost the Bitcoin sponsorship) and things moved super fast,"" Schnelli told CoinDesk.      In a press release, Okamoto commented, “We believe it is essential that we do our part to help advance the Bitcoin network. Absent core developers like Jonas, Bitcoin’s efficacy and long-term adoption, and therefore our business, could be impacted. This grant will allow Jonas to continue his important work on our collective behalf.”    Funding Bitcoin development    The funding is crucial for an open-source project like Bitcoin that has no company or central entity backing it, and it’s coming from a grassroots movement of Bitcoin companies following each other’s leads to give back part of their profits to the developer community.    Read more: Bitcoin Core Lead Maintainer Steps Back, Encourages Decentralization    Schnelli has been contributing to Bitcoin Core since 2013 and his 516 commits make him the the ninth most active developer on the Bitcoin Core code. Along with his work on the Bitcoin source code, he has created a code library for creating Bitcoin applications in the C coding language and helped design the BitBox hardware wallet.      In addition to this grant, Schnelli also has 55 individual sponsors on GitHub.      Schnelli told CoinDesk that he'll use the new funding ""to work on Bitcoin Core, mainly on maintenance and usability."" Namely, he'd like to finish up a working version of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 324 for encrypted peer-to-peer messaging between Bitcoin nodes, along with ""proposing a Simplified Payment Verification mode (SPV) for Bitcoin Core"" and working on Bitcoin Core CI scripts.    Bitcoin developer grants    Another Bitcoin developer, João Barbosa, had his funding from Bitmain revoked at the same time as Schnelli, but Barbosa bounced back at the end of 2020 when he received one of Coinbase’s first Crypto Community Fund grants.      Schnelli and Barbosa's positions are not uncommon.      Before last year, most all open-source developers in Bitcoin volunteered their time to work on the Bitcoin software and protocol. Others were lucky enough to be hired by a well-capitalized firm like Blockstream or Chaincode Labs, but most never received compensation for their work.      Now, dozens of open source protocol developers and software designers are on the payrolls of Marathon, Coinbase, BitMEX, Kraken, OKCoin, Square Crypto, Gemini and Human Rights Foundation, among others.

42405803,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeodVq,1611856505,"Blockchain Bites: DOGE Chases After GameStop, Guggenheim Doubts $30K Bitcoin","Three stories    1. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank will keep its policies loose. The Fed will maintain its current $120 billion per month bond-buying program until “substantial further progress” is made in terms of inflation and employment.    “I’m much more worried about falling short of a complete recovery and losing people’s careers and lives that they built because they don’t get back to work in time,” Powell said. “I’m much more concerned about that than the possibility which exists of higher inflation. … Frankly, we’d welcome higher inflation.”    Bitcoin enthusiasts see long-term benefits for the cryptocurrency under this current regime, which is committed to letting inflation run hot. Bitcoin didn’t react to the Fed’s statements immediately, but is up 7% (at press time) after trading in the red Wednesday.    Powell was asked about bitcoin, in a question about how cheap money could be creating bubbles. His response: “Financial stability vulnerabilities overall are moderate.”  Separately, the chief banker at BIS, the bank for central banks, Agustín Carstens, cast doubt on bitcoin’s long-term viability Wednesday, saying bitcoin’s volatility would be its downfall.    2. The DeFi scene is heating up.Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital asset manager, has filed to register five new trusts for cryptocurrency assets, several being connected to the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. (Digital Currency Group owns Grayscale and CoinDesk.)    Aave, cosmos, polkadot, monero and cardano were all listed in new filings, though none of this means there will absolutely be a Grayscale XLM trust anytime soon, or ever.  Meanwhile, Uniswap’s native token uni (UNI) broke $15 per token on Coinbase Wednesday morning. It’s up more than 92% in one week and up 1,300% since the token debuted in September 2020.  This makes UNI the highest-valued DeFi coin, in terms of market cap. As previously reported, DeFi’s “total value locked” crossed the $25 billion milestone.  DeFi darling Curv partnered with Algorand, the proof-of-stake network launched by Turing Award winner Silvio Macali, to build new wallet technologies.    3. Long-time bitcoin skeptic Mark Cuban has apparently reversed course and gone bullish on nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain. Corresponding with CoinDesk’s Jeff Wilser, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks and ""Shark Tank"" celebrity said, “You can sell anything digital using NFT,” conceivably even merch for his basketball team.    “The upside is truly unlimited,” Cuban said, talking about the entire crypto space. “It is a platform for any number of amazing applications that outperform their traditional finance counterparts.”  At stake    Game. Stop. Yesterday, I was talking to a colleague about, what else, GameStop and the gamification of the stock market. We’ve covered here in the past how traditional markets are becoming more and more like crypto, especially as coronavirus precautions cause people to spend more time online.      Millennial-friendly brokerages like Robinhood allow just about anyone to buy, hold and trade, take out complicated derivatives positions and even fractionalize stocks – turning the S&P 500, though more often, penny stocks, into a casino.      That, coupled with the easy money of zero interest-rate macroeconomic policy (ZIRP) has caused some, say, distortions in the market. It’s with all this in mind that my colleague actually asked seriously, has crypto become more rational than stocks?      All of this starts with WallStreetBets, a subreddit dedicated to day trading, and what has become perhaps the biggest financial story since markets bottomed out in March, during the early days of the coronavirus crisis. A plan was hatched among the self-proclaimed “degenerate traders” on Reddit to pump the price of GameStock (GME), “squeezing” a hedge fund that had gone short on the video game retailer (which has seen better days).      What began out as a whimsical attempt to best a hedge fund has had real effects, with real money on the line. As CoinDesk’s Zack Voell notes, a similar playbook is being repeated across other stocks, including BlackBerry (BB), AMC Entertainment (AMC) and Kodak (KODK).      To try to prevent the meme-fueled contagion, WSB’s moderators briefly took the subreddit private last night while Discord banned the group’s server, ostensibly for hate speech. TD Ameritrade has halted GME trading and Nasdaq – the second-largest stock exchange in the world – said the platform has begun monitoring social media and will halt trading if another WallStreetBets-driven pump is flagged.      Even the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is watching, issuing a brief statement that it is “reviewing” the “ongoing market volatility.”      CoinDesk columnist Preston Byrne said the trend is likely to continue, in a recent op-ed: “The people who stand to lose the most from GameStop-style events are going to try to curtail freedom of speech and economic freedom by targeting the technology companies that enable the exercise of those freedoms.”      It’s crazy! It actually makes my head hurt! As Bloomberg Matt Levine columnist wrote, “A popular conclusion from the GameStop story is, ‘Well, I guess the stock market is nonsense now,’ and I’m not sure that conclusion is wrong. Seems like the sort of thing the SEC wouldn’t like. But what can they do about it?”      Crypto has its fair share of pump and dumps. In the long list of crypto assets (more than 8,000) any given token or coin could pump any given day for seemingly any given reason. But as market commentator Mati Greenspan told First Mover this morning, “You gotta take the bad with good. Overall, what we’re talking about is the democratization and freedom of financial markets.”      Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian has also picked up on the trend, telling CNBC's ""Squawk Box"": ""We vote with two things in the USA: votes and dollars. The internet has obviously had a huge impact on our democratic process. Now we're seeing the impact it's having when the internet revolutionizes the dollar votes, too.”      As often said, many view bitcoin as a buy against the unprecedented amount of money printing. Ethereum is an increasingly attractive offer for institutional investors because a legitimate, though experimental, alternative financial system is being built on top of it.      So has crypto become saner than traditional markets? Well, maybe you should see what happened to doge.      CORRECTION (Jan. 28, 23:11 UTC): An original reference to BlackBerry called the stock ""heavily shorted."" Approximately 7% of BlackBerry’s outstanding shares are currently sold short.    Market intel    Following a tweet from “WSB Chairman,"" unaffiliated with the popular subreddit, inquiring about the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin prices went haywire.    Dogecoin (DOGE) surged over 250% Thursday morning to above $0.027, giving the meme-based cryptocurrency a total market value over $2.5 billion.  DOGE is prone to random spikes and random ""endorsements"" coming from the likes of TikTok, adult star Angela White and, of course, Elon Musk.    Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of the multi-billion dollar investment firm Guggenheim Partners, said bitcoin will have a hard time staying above $30,000.    “Right now, the reality of the institutional demand that would support a $35,000 price or even a $30,000 price is just not there,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Wednesday.  The comments come weeks after he publicly declared bitcoin’s price should be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.    Bitcoin typically underperforms during tax time, new data shows. From 2014 to 2020, bitcoin was down in four out of seven Januarys and six out of the past seven Marchs. According to Delphi Digital, average losses for those months were 5.24% and 12.59%, respectively.    “It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly how much selling pressure can be expected, and different jurisdictions treat capital gains more favorably than others,” Kevin Kelly, co-founder and head of global macro at Delphi Digital, said. “But bitcoin alone added more than $400 billion to its total market value last year. A decent portion of those returns accrued to speculators and traders who may have already realized some gains or rolled profits into other corners of the crypto market, thus triggering taxable events.”  Who won Crypto Twitter?",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/28/blockchain-bites-doge-chases-after-gamestop-guggenheim-doubts-30k-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f67d375026eee82f18aaeccd21c5829e37a7c53-1962x1242.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42405792,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeodM0,1611856252,OCC Halts Fair Access Banking Rule,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Thursday put former acting Comptroller Brian Brooks' controversial ""fair access"" banking rule on hold pending a review by the new administration.    Brooks' so-called ""fair access"" rule sought to prohibit federally chartered banks from denying financial services such as lending to would-be clients on political or ideological grounds.  While the rule never mentioned cryptocurrencies, it came as welcome news to businesses in the space, which have long struggled to obtain or keep bank accounts in the U.S.  The OCC rushed to finalize the rule before the end of President Donald Trump's term, but it was never published in the Federal Register.

However, traders and analysts are not sure whether the rebound is sustainable, with some telling CoinDesk it was likely the result of GameStop’s stock drama.  At the press time, bitcoin’s price was at $31,817.11, up 3.49% in the past 24 hours.  “What I'm seeing today is indeed a trend upwards,” Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter crypto trader, said. “But it's still too early to call whether this is a return to a bullish cycle or not.”  The current crypto market seems to be distracted by the ongoing GameStop situation, where a group of Redditors on a board called “Wall Street Bets” (WSB) sent GameStop shares (NYSE: GME) skyrocketing in order to squeeze hedge funds that were betting against the video game retailer and its stock.  The effect of GameStop on crypto is hard to ignore, according to traders, and the price for meme-centered crypto dogecoin (DOGE) nearly doubled in the past 24 hours.  Simons Chen, executive director of investment and trading at Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance, told CoinDesk GME’s stock movement has led to a general “fear of missing out” (FOMO) impact on retail traders in the U.S.  Stocks rallied after markets opened Thursday morning, reversing losses from Wednesday’s sell-off.  A Twitter account calling itself the “WSB Chairman,” which has about 485,000 followers though not associated with the Reddit group, posted several tweets Wednesday night about bitcoin and dogecoin.  The Reddit-based trading community ""seems to be looking for the next ‘meme stock,’” Andreotti said. “And many of them landed on dogecoin, for example, which is up near 200% in the last 24 hours, [the] best performing crypto of the day.”  At the time of writing, most of the cryptocurrencies on the CoinDesk 20 were rising, with 0x (ZRX), ethereum classic (ETC) and cosmos (ATOM) are among those with the most significant gains.

42405793,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeodNy,1611852273,Inside Iran's Onslaught on Bitcoin Mining,"Iran is trying to make crypto mining a source of income for the state, while cracking down on miners.      Iran, hit hard by international sanctions, lost revenue supplied by oil exports. Crypto might be a way to get some extra cash, so Iran has been toughening its grip on miners at home in an effort to better control this revenue stream. Since last year, Iran has also opened new opportunities for foreign mining firms.      Iran is a notable player on the bitcoin mining market, and during 2020 it contributed almost 4% of the global bitcoin hashpower, according to research by the University of Cambridge.      But Iran’s relationship with miners is best described as complicated.      On the one hand, Iran clearly sees crypto mining as a way to generate income for the state. Iran began requiring miners to register with the country’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Trade and pay a higher tariff on electricity than retail or industrial users last year.      But Iran has also blamed bitcoin miners for recent power outages. Just this month, Iranian authorities reportedly shut down 1,620 unregistered mining farms and confiscated 45,000 mining devices.      CoinDesk takes a deep dive into Iranian mining.    Lights out    In January, Iran experienced a number of power outages. The authorities blamed the outages on bitcoin miners and went for a sweeping attack on miners, big and small.      Ziya Sadr, Iranian bitcoin advocate and blogger, insists that mining has nothing to do with outages and instead blames government mismanagement of the electricity grids. “They shut down miners, but we still have blackouts. So guess what? It’s nothing to do with the miners!” Sadr told CoinDesk.      To be sure, the government has said miners only consume 2% of Iran’s electricity, according to the Associated Press.    Read more: Iran Is Ripe for Bitcoin Adoption, Even as Government Clamps Down on Mining    But the Iranian government has also claimed miners have made the country’s power grid “unstable” since 2019, Radio Free Europe reported. The publication cited Iran’s deputy energy minister, who said some mining farms were based in ""schools and mosques"" that receive electricity for free.      Iranian journalist Ehsan Norouzi wrote in 2019 that the list of entities running mining operations on free electricity might actually be much bigger: the country’s elite armed forces, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, control a broad network of religious schools, mosques and other entities that get electricity for free.      There is no proof all of them are mining crypto, Norouzi told CoinDesk via a call, but “if there is free electricity there will be a market for it,” he said. Back in 2019, Iranians were sharing photos on social networks of at least one mining farm in a mosque. The government asked the mullahs to declare fatwas against stealing electricity.    Chinese investors    Among the victims of the latest blackout-related shutdowns is a mining company that recently opened a big farm in one of the country’s special economic zones.      On Jan. 14, a couple days after a nation-wide power outage, Iranian authorities temporarily shut down a mining farm in Rafsanjan, Kerman province, citing the excessive burden on the power grid. The data center was certified by the authorities, according to the local new outlet Mehr News, but was taken offline “in order to manage [power] consumption in the current situation.”    The farm is operated by the Iran and China Investment Development Grouphttp://iranchinaidg.com/about/. The organization's website does not mention crypto mining, only saying that Iranian and Chinese investors are building a joint 1 million terabyte datacenter in the Rafsanjan special economic zone. The idea that the Chinese crypto miners were to blame for the blackout quickly spread on Twitter, prompting some anti-China sentiment, The Diplomat reported.    The Chinese investor is a company called RHY, according to Omid Alavi, head of Vira Miners, and Ziya Sadr. Two Iranian miners who wanted to stay anonymous also told CoinDesk that it was RHY’s farm that was shut down.      RHY boasts multiple mining sites, including some in the Middle East, without specifying where. On its website, RHY posted a video titled “175 MW Mine,” showing several hangars filled with ASICs. A car briefly appearing in the video has a license plate with Farsi lettering and a flag resembling the Iranian one.      According to the electricity bill, translated by The Diplomat, the mining farm consumed a little short of 60 megawatt of power during one month. BBC Persian reported a similar capacity for the farm in Rafsanjan.      RHY does not share the company’s contact information on its website, and a customer service chat operator declined to connect CoinDesk to RHY management or a PR representative. The operator also declined to discuss the firm’s Iran business. A request for comment sent via RHY’s Facebook page went unanswered.      The Rafsanjan farm shut down because after Iran introduced the new rules for miners, the electricity tariff went up sharply, Alavi believes.      “The Chinese came two years ago and they were looking for cheap electricity,” Alavi said. “They found some place in Kerman and started building a big farm. At that time, the Iranian government didn’t have any regulation in crypto, and they [the Chinese company] used the industrial tariff. After one year, the government started regulation and changed the tariff, so the company had to pay new bills.”      An Iranian Telegram channel dedicated to miners’ issues with authorities mentioned the story in a Jan. 14 post, writing that “any foreign investor will run away after seeing the treatment of the Chinese investor in Rafsanjan.”      The channel also posted a letter of Mohammad Hassan Ranjbar, chairman of the Board of Directors of Iran-China Investment Development Group. According to Ranjbar, the mining farm in Rafsanjan had been paying 4,000 rials per kilowatt, which is a high price.      “China is currently the only country that can invest in Iran due to sanctions,” Ranjbar said in that statement, also quoted by Aljazeera. “It is both rich and has technology, so we can help each other to invest and build more projects. But we can also send them away from Iran and become completely isolated and alone in the world.”    Foreign guests    RHY was not the only Chinese mining company in Iran – an array of firms have been active in the country for a couple of years. In August 2019, miner Liu Feng told the Chinese crypto media outlet 8btc he moved 3,000 of his ASICs to Iran to take advantage of the country’s cheap electricity, $0.006 per kilowatt-hour.      In August 2020, Chinese mining pool Lubian also told 8btc about building a mining farm in Iran. Lubian broke into the bitcoin hashrate competition last spring right after the latest bitcoin halving, immediately becoming one of the leading mining pools.      Talking to 8btc, Lubian co-founder Liu Ping said the mining pool established a good rapport with Iranian authorities.      “We have our own customs clearance channels as we have the experience of establishing the logistics company. And we have good local resources in Iran, and we have maintained good relations with the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and even the army in Iran,” he said.      It’s not only Chinese miners that are tapping into Iran’s energy market: In April 2020, Turkish mining firm iMiner reportedly received a license for a 6,000-ASIC farm in the city of Semnan.    Read more: Iranian Authorities Close 1,620 Illegal Cryptocurrency Mining Farms: Report    Dmytro Ziablov, CEO of Ukrainian mining company BeeMiner, told CoinDesk the company is running a 2-megawatt mining facility in Iran and is planning to expand to 70 megawatts later this year. BeeMiner received hosting requests from Chinese companies, including Huobi Pool, Ziablov said: “The Chinese government gets not that friendly to the miners from time to time, so [miners are] interested in finding new places to mine.”      In addition to the Chinese miners, Turkish and UAE companies are also coming to Iran, Ziablov said. Asked if it was difficult to get the farm licensed in Iran, he said the process took 2.5 months. “It’s hard, but with some persistence, connections and resources it’s feasible,” he added. He said he didn’t know why the Chinese farm in Rafsanjan had to shut down.    Domestic challenges    In the meantime, for small-scale domestic miners the situation has been tough in recent years, according to one long-time miner who talked to CoinDesk anonymously.      Basir (not his real name) told CoinDesk he started mining seven years ago, but three years ago, the authorities took notice. In May 2018, police came to Basir’s house, he said, telling him they suspect he owned an unlicensed gun. Then they saw the ASICs. First, the police thought the machines were “a spy server,” but then the cyber police figured out what they were dealing with.      According to him, Basir spent one week in jail, was charged with having illegal income and money laundering and had to pay a bail that basically swept out his family’s wealth. CoinDesk could not independently verify the details of Basir’s account.      “I sold the house, I sold the car, I sold the graphic cards [that were in my] warehouse at the low price, gold and savings. All was destroyed,” he said. “My luxury life turned into a poor life.”    Read more: Iran Reportedly Seizes 45K Bitcoin Mining Machines After Closure of Illegal Operations    Last year, the Iranian government issued a directive that all mining facilities in Iran must register with the government. The owners must disclose their identities, the size of their farms and what kinds of ASICs they are using. The government has also raised the electricity tariff from 482 rials to 1,930 for kilowatt per hour (in U.S. dollars, from 0.1 cent to 4.6 cents).      According to the Ministry of Energy, there are currently 24 officially registered mining farms in Iran, consuming 310 megawatt of power.      Miners also need to register their mining equipment, and if it was smuggled into the country, they need to pay the customs fees if those weren’t paid in time, Sadr said. Until recently, there simply was no legal procedure to import ASICs into Iran at all, he added.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/28/inside-irans-onslaught-on-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edb893b24802801a797d8899ef162ceba64f4b02-2560x968.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meme-Based Cryptocurrency Soars More Than 800% to Record High,"Dogecoin (DOGE) surged more than 800% Thursday to about $0.082 per coin, giving the meme-based cryptocurrency a market value of about $7 billion and apparently prompting a congratulatory tweet from DOGE lover Elon Musk.    DOGE, which was started as a joke in 2013, is now the 10th most valuable cryptocurrency by market value, just behind Bitcoin Cash and ahead of BNB.  The price of DOGE rose to an all-time high of $0.082 per Messari, before settling down to $0.073, up 822% over the last 24 hours and bringing the year-to-date gains to about the same amount. Over $12 million worth of DOGE traded in the past 24 hours.  Why the token has soared is unclear but it's likely largely caused by attention from public Reddit trading collective Wall Street Bets along with a TikTok post about the ""dogecoin army"" by niche celebrity Carole Baskin from Netflix's ""Tiger King.""  Regardless of why DOGE is barking so loudly today, it certainly captured the imagination of the crypto pack and beyond. According to data provider The Tie, DOGE set a new record for the most tweets on a cryptocurrency over a 24-hour period, besting the previous marks set by leading cryptocurrency bitcoin on Jan. 2, 2021, and Dec. 22, 2017.  Erratic price action is not unusual for any cryptocurrency, let alone dogecoin. Last month, a few tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent the token flying.

42405787,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeodI4,1611846890,"Scarcity Gives Bitcoin Value, but Not the Way You Think","Among Bitcoin’s principal tenets is the idea that its baked-in scarcity makes it valuable. Bitcoin’s algorithmically determined rate of increase certainly makes it scarce when demand for the bitcoin cryptocurrency is rising, though not so much when it is falling. Furthermore, the fact that the algorithm provides for bitcoin’s supply to stop increasing about 120 years from now means that its supply is finite. Unless the code is changed (and that raises questions about what “Bitcoin” even means), there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins.      As I will show, however, bitcoin’s scarcity doesn’t stem from its finite nature, but from potentially infinite – though fickle – demand. And its legendary volatility is linked less to its scarcity or its finite nature and more to its inherent inflexibility. These distinctions may sound slight, but I argue they amount to important revisions of our understanding of this technology.    Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book, “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.    Scarcity is hardly unique to bitcoin. All assets are scarce. Indeed anything that has a price is scarce, by definition. If there is no scarcity, there is no price. Things that are so abundant that everyone can have all they want are free, even if they are objectively valuable to humans. Air, for example, is free, though it is so valuable to humans that we can’t exist without it.      Price is the mechanism by which markets equilibrate the supply of, and demand for, scarce objects. When there is more demand for a product than supply, the price rises until demand falls sufficiently for supply to be adequate. This means some people’s demand for the product will be partly or completely unsatisfied. In a free market, it is normal – indeed necessary – for people to be priced out of the market.      Conversely, when there is a greater supply of a product than demand, its price falls until demand rises sufficiently to mop up the excess. In retail markets, price falls might take the form of discounting and special offers.      Sometimes there is no demand for a product at any price, even a negative one. “You can’t pay people to take it away,” as the saying goes. There may be a limited supply of these things no one wants, but it is ridiculous to call them “scarce.” There are far too many of them. When there is an over-supply of a product, it becomes not simply worthless but costly to the holder because it incurs storage and disposal charges.      This brings me to what I regard as the fundamental problem with the definition of scarcity used by Bitcoin’s advocates. They confuse “scarce” with finite. It’s not necessary for something to have a fixed supply for it to be scarce; and things whose supply is constantly increasing are not necessarily abundant.    The passenger pigeon    To illustrate the difference between abundant, scarce and finite, let’s consider the sad story of the passenger pigeon, a bird once native to the U.S. but now extinct.      Back in the 19th century, passenger pigeons were so abundant that observers described them as “darkening the sky” in flight. They were a serious nuisance to crops but a free source of meat and eggs. So people were paid to kill them.      See also: Frances Coppola - Banks Are Toast but Crypto Has Lost Its Soul      As people killed passenger pigeons by the millions and destroyed their forest breeding grounds, their numbers crashed. Lawmakers did not believe that something so abundant could ever become scarce, so attempts to protect the bird with legislation failed, The carnage continued and the species went into terminal decline.      The last wild bird is thought to have been shot in 1901. The birds survived in zoos for a few more years, but breeding proved impossible. The last passenger pigeon, Martha, died in the Cincinnati Zoo on Sept. 1, 1914. She was (and remains, since after her death she was stuffed) a bird of infinite value, the last of her kind and the icon of her species.      While passenger pigeons still existed in the wild, their supply was not finite. They nested, laid eggs and brought up chicks. But the rate at which they reproduced could not keep up with the rate at which humans were destroying them, so they became scarce. If humans had stopped shooting them and stealing their eggs, their supply would have increased again. In contrast, if bitcoins are lost, they can never be replaced. The supply is permanently reduced. So bitcoins are finite, but the passenger pigeon was not.    Bitcoin is therefore intrinsically volatile, not because of its scarcity or its finite nature, but because of its inflexibility.    The passenger pigeon became scarce not because it had a finite supply, but because demand for it far exceeded the rate at which its supply was increasing. And because humans refused to believe it was becoming scarce, its price failed to rise to match supply and demand. The “stickiness” of the passenger pigeon’s zero price ensured its demise. This is a type of market failure known as the “tragedy of the commons.” As Joni Mitchell sang, “You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone.”      Towards its end, the passenger pigeon became both scarce and finite because it would not breed in captivity. That ultimately is why it became extinct. But had the zoos been able to establish successful breeding programs, the passenger pigeon would not have been finite. It might still be with us today. And like all endangered species, it would now be protected by law. Endangered species aren’t finite but they are so scarce and valuable that people risk their lives to protect them.      So it is not a finite supply that creates scarcity. It is a persistent excess of demand over supply. In a well-functioning market, if demand for a product rises faster than its supply, its price will rise even though its supply is increasing.      See also: Frances Coppola - Crypto’s Choice: Join the Financial System or Fight It      For some kinds of good, there are natural limits to demand: Everyone needs water, but there is a limit to how much water people can drink. However, drinkable water is scarce and the population is growing. Even if the supply of drinkable water increases, therefore, it will remain scarce as long as the rate of increase is the same or lower than the rate of increase of the population.      But for other types of good, such as gold and bitcoin, demand is potentially insatiable. The price of these things should therefore rise continually even if the supply is uncapped and continually increasing, provided the rate of increase is not so great that people lose interest. So it's possible to continually create more of something without making it so abundant that it becomes worthless.    What this means for bitcoin    And this brings me back to bitcoin. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap does not make it scarce. After all, 21 million of things no one wants is abundance (or “oversupply”), not scarcity. Like every asset, bitcoin is scarce when demand for it exceeds the available supply. When demand crashes, as it did in 2014 and 2018, bitcoin can’t really be said to be scarce, even though the supply hasn’t increased.  However, Bitcoin’s supply algorithm does affect the price because it makes it impossible for bitcoin’s supply to respond to demand. Just as passenger pigeons couldn’t increase their rate of reproduction to compensate for the rate at which humans were killing them, so Bitcoin can’t increase or reduce its rate of production to compensate for changes in demand for bitcoins. And in a well-functioning market, when supply can’t respond to demand, the price must adjust.      Bitcoin is therefore intrinsically volatile, not because of its scarcity or its finite nature but because of its inflexibility. As the size of its market increases we might find its price swings becoming less frequent but much larger, just as a young bubbly stream becomes a meandering river that periodically overflows its banks. While bitcoin’s supply remains inelastic, its price will remain subject to change without warning.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/28/scarcity-gives-bitcoin-value-but-not-the-way-you-think,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05b76a181fcaf4b6327db1879dbab94cd30eb152-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It now has a market value of $1.7 billion.)      In traditional markets, European shares fell and U.S. stocks wobbled. Gold weakened 0.2% to $1,841 an ounce.    Market moves    For cryptocurrency traders and analysts, one of the things that's so surreal about the GameStop saga is that it all seems so familiar.      Whether illegal or perfectly legit, so many of the hallmarks of the upstart trade, bred in a social-media den as a way of challenging mighty Wall Street's privileged position in finance, bear more than a passing resemblance to the kind of activity that takes place daily in digital markets.      Not that anyone in crypto's really bragging – just saying: The episode might serve as another example of how different markets might look and behave in a technology-enabled, decentralized future where the balance of power isn't so concentrated among the always-winners.      In search of takeaways, First Mover reached out to the financial historian Niall Ferguson, former Morgan Stanley-banker-turned-crypto-banker Caitlin Long, Themys.io CEO Jonathan Mohan and Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan. Here's what they said:      1) The GameStop coterie isn't the only crowd taking on big finance. Just like the retail-trading raiders in the Reddit forum Wall Street Bets who took on short-selling hedge funds with billions of dollars of capital, the cryptocurrency industry was born as a way to fight back against concentration of power and wealth. The Bitcoin blockchain was invented as a peer-to-peer electronic payment system, designed to be free from the influence or control (or rent-seeking tendency) of banks. ""In the plague year, a lot of people have started to experiment with investing in things they hadn't really touched before,"" Ferguson said in a Zoom interview. ""The barbarians [at] the gates 30 years ago are the establishment now, and there are new barbarians at the gates.""      2) Percentage moves, in the hundreds, are something to expect, even accept. As reported Wednesday by CoinDesk's Zack Voell, GameStop (GME) saw its stock price surge nearly 900% in five days. That's not unprecedented in digital markets. Sure, bitcoin's price quadrupled last year. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, rose fivefold. But, according to the website CoinMarketCap, there are at least 8,350 cryptocurrencies in existence, many of which nobody has ever heard of, and many of whose prices go up and down by ridiculous amounts nearly every day (see table below). The whole thing can sometimes resemble pink-sheet markets where hard-luck penny-stock traders sometimes finds good luck. But it's also apparently what happens when entrepreneurs and speculators get together in a lightly policed market environment. ""There are certainly within the crypto markets a lot of scams and pump and dumps, but you gotta take the bad with good,"" Greenspan said in an audio interview over Telegram. ""Overall, what we’re talking about is the democratization and freedom of financial markets.""      3) Bookkeeping-by-blockchain might be more efficient than Wall Street's ledger systems. According to the firm S3 Partners, some 139% of GameStop's available shares were borrowed to ""sell short"" – meaning the traders sold the borrowed shares in a bet that the stock price would go down; the idea is they'll buy the shares back to repay the stock loan after the price falls. Long, whose firm Avanti won a special-purpose banking charter in October from the state of Wyoming, says GameStop's ratio shows some big investors might have sold shares that they hadn't already borrowed, a practice known as ""naked short-selling"" that is generally prohibited but loosely enforced. It happens because of Wall Street's impossibility of instantaneously coordinating multiple ledgers of who owns what and when. With blockchain networks, the information is always being synchronized. ""Bitcoin really does fix this, because Bitcoin is an honest ledger,"" Long said in a phone interview. ""The reason why the crypto market is so riled up about GameStop is because the crypto market has known about the inaccuracies in Wall Street’s bookkeeping for years. This is just another in a long list of examples.""      4) Many new investors appear to be in it not just for the money, but the fun, the entertainment, the joke, the thrill. GameStop as a franchise is a sort of punchline. Not only are almost all games sold online, but people certainly aren't flocking to the stores these days. Even the brand looks worn. ""Some people are saying that the fundamentals are broken and that they don’t understand what happened with GameStop, and that it’s some kind of meme or a joke,"" Mohan said in a phone interview. ""In cryptocurrency we call that dogecoin. It’s a well-understood phenomenon. Sometimes retail investors can aggregate demand, over a joke, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. That spirit and that essence is sort of bubbling out into the traditional equities market.""      - Bradley Keoun    What's hot    Guggenheim CIO Minerd, who has predicted a bitcoin price of $400K, tells Bloomberg TV the base of institutional buyers is ""just not there"" to push bitcoin's price above $35,000 (CoinDesk)      Blockstream buys $25M of bitcoin mining machines from MicroBT (CoinDesk)      Grayscale eyes DeFi with new trust filings (CoinDesk) (EDITOR'S NOTE: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)

The arrangement will see Curv integrate Algorand within its ""asset-agnostic"" infrastructure, while Algorand will leverage Curv’s custody solutions internally.      The firms aim to enable institutions to build secure wallet functionality into applications on the Algorand network, backed by Curv’s multi-party computation (MPC) technology. Curv users will also be able to transact and store ALGO and ALGO-based ASA tokens.      “We want to offer a kind of trusted DeFi,” Algorand COO Sean Ford told CoinDesk. “To be sure, we are building technology that appeals to traditional institutions, payment providers [and] governments. Curv embodies the coming together of traditional financial investors with the DeFi space.”    Read more: Coinbase Ventures Joins $23M Funding Round for Crypto Custody Firm    Curv, which has raised almost $30 million in funding since 2019, uses MPC to secure cryptographic keys by splitting them up, but doing so without sacrificing service-level functionality.      “Just three years ago, security in this industry was synonymous with either cold storage or a piece of hardware,” Curv CEO Itay Malinger said in an interview. “MPC is the quickest way to sign transactions securely without any bottlenecks, and that’s what you need for the kind of scale Algorand delivers.”      Algorand and Curv are already primed for DeFi. For example, Curv started working with lending platform Compound in the summer of last year.      Curv said there has been demand from both the crypto world and traditional finance to support the ALGO token and tokenized assets over Algorand's network.      The New York-based custody startup also brings an institutional flavor to the table with its digital asset insurance protection up to $50 million, courtesy of Munich Re, plus various security accreditations. Its customers include investment firm Franklin Templeton, trading platform eToro and Genesis Trading, which is owned by CoinDesk parent firm Digital Currency Group.

According to a press release on Thursday, blockchain infrastructure provider CoreLedger and soon-to-launch peer-to-peer marketplace Abakus are aiming to create a digital barter economy within the country.      CoreLedger’s technology is expected to allow farmers to redeem and trade their tokenized farming assets with any other tokenized asset on the Abakus platform.      For example, soybeans would work like an asset-backed currency to be traded for cattle, corn or the Argentine peso, according to the press release. Assets on Abakus will also be available to both national and international investors.      ""In an inflation-stricken country, access to physically backed assets can be the difference between surviving and thriving for these farmers,"" said CoreLedger CEO Johannes Schweifer.      Schweifer also said 40% of the world’s soybean oil and soybean meal production comes from Argentina and that the initiative is of ""great national interest"" to small farmers seeking to liquify their assets.      Argentina has struggled with hyperinflation since as early as the 1980s, compounded by foreign debt, excessive government spending and a recession that continues to plague the Latin American nation.

42385795,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOK4F,1611836263,'The Squeezening': How the GameStop Backlash Will Curtail Freedom,"The GameStop short squeeze – in Bitcoin parlance “the Squeezening” – is only the latest example of online memes crossing into the real world and having real-world consequences.      Those of us who have been on the internet for a little while will recall the glory days of 4Chan and the practice of online griefers mobbing Second Life or Habbo Hotel.    Preston Byrne, a CoinDesk columnist, is a partner in Anderson Kill's Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. He advises software, internet and fintech companies.    We also recall that those griefers – or, at least, their fellow-travelers – experimented with real-world organizing in a series of protests around the world against the Church of Scientology, code-named “Project Chanology.” I remember these protests well and recall gushing about them to one of my law school classmates in total amazement that references to LongCat, Over 9000, and Rick Astley were being piped into the open air of London’s streets. Few if any people older than we were would have understood them.      The esoteric nature of that subculture notwithstanding, the protests made national news across the world for a variety of reasons. In London, for example, an eponymous teenager named Epic Nose Guy refused to put away a sign reading “Scientology is a Dangerous Cult” and received a court summons as a result, raising free speech concerns. Ultimately, though, the interest in these protests was not due to anyone treating them particularly seriously. Most observers seemed only mildly amused that something online managed to get out of its cage, albeit temporarily, and make its presence known among the normies.      Fast forward a decade and it is clear historians of the future will see the Anonymous street protests of 2008 as being more consequential than the global financial crisis that emerged later in the year.      Our world is now in thrall to the memes. I have argued elsewhere that bitcoin is best understood as meme money: “Bitcoin’s growth is not based on its technology alone (which, while powerful, is open-source and therefore easily replicable) but rather on the strength of virality, encouraged by the vested interests who held early and invested in marketing it; with no genuine business underlying it, it acquires its (very substantial) memetic potency only from the evangelism of those who hodl and preach.”      See also: Wall Street, Big Tech Clamp Down on GameStop-Style Pumps; Biden Admin ‘Monitoring’ Situation      So it has been with every other major upset of the last four years. Donald Trump was the meme President. The trespassing in the U.S. Capitol three weeks ago by some of the same people who produced those memes in 2016 was driven, at least in part, by new and even more potent conspiratorial memes on the internet. Now, hedge funds are getting utterly destroyed by a group Redditors gleefully committing memetic securities fraud in the open.      The crypto-universe, being principally concerned with meme money, contains both institutional types who are, at least as far as I can tell, thoroughly rattled at the roving band of meme-barbarians at their gates. It also contains meme warriors euphoric at their newfound power.      And just as we have seen social media companies co-opted by state actors to carry out censorship of enemy memes, financial services providers shatter norms at warp speed by cutting off brokerage accounts from hot meme stocks like $GME and $AMC.      Once the lulz have been had, the GameStop event will likely lead to calls for (a) Section 230 reform by elites who are rattled that a bunch of s**tposters can ruin them in the markets and (b) some type of regulatory intervention in the markets.    Once the lulz have been had, the Gamestop event will likely lead to calls for.. reform by elites who are rattled [by] a bunch of s**tposters.    In other words, the people who stand to lose the most from GameStop-style events are going to try to curtail freedom of speech and economic freedom by targeting the technology companies that enable the exercise of those freedoms. Trump’s loss in the election wrought social media censorship. The invasion of the Capitol led to the military occupation of Washington, D.C., and calls for harsh domestic anti-terror laws. The Squeezening will engender a regulatory response, too.      The Squeezening is only the latest example of how mass, instantaneous global communication lays perpetual, unsleeping siege to our analog society. We need to adapt to memetic warfare and develop new methods – a new Trivium, new commercial contract boilerplate, new employment terms – which can be instantly invoked at the first sign of memetic disturbance to halt transactions and legal processes that may have fallen under the influence of a malign internet mob.      See also: GameStop Investing Craze ‘Proof of Concept’ for Bitcoin Success, Says Scaramucci      If we don’t, stringent regulations will try (and fail) to restrain the memes at the expense of our freedom.

The ""WSB Chairman"" Twitter account, which has quickly gained almost 400,000 followers and says it is not associated with the Reddit group, tweeted Thusday: “A lot of you are talking about Dogecoin. What’s that? A meme crypto?” In another tweet they asked: “Has Doge ever been to a dollar?”      According to a Bloomberg report, members of Reddit group SatoshiStreetBets were also excitedly egging on the DOGE action.      In response, the price of the Shiba Inu meme-based cryptocurrency shot up as much as 142%, from $0.007 to $0.017 in under two hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data. At press time, Thursday, DOGE was trading lower at $0.012.      The WallStreetBets Reddit community has in particular focused on GameStop (GME), driving its share price up nearly 900% in five days to around $347 on Wednesday. Amid signs of potential regulatory scrutiny over its actions, the message board has since been taken private by its moderators leaving followers searching for information on other social media sites.      The U.S. Securities Exchange Commisison (SEC) released a notice on Wednesday not directly acknowledging the group's activity, but stating it is ""reviewing"" the ""ongoing market volatility.""      DOGE's latest price spike is reminiscent of a sharp rise last summer as videos on TikTok encouraged users to invest in the cryptocurrency. And, on Jan. 3, adult star Angela White tweeted she had been a HODler of DOGE, prompting many of her 1.3 million followers to push the price up as much as 203%.

In an announcement Wednesday, the exchange said, ""In light of recent events and community feedback, [bitcoin sv] and related trading pairs will be delisted.""      CoinDesk reached out to clarify the reasons for the move, with CEO Adrian Przelozny responding:      ""Bitcoin is 'The People's Money.' At its very core are the principles of openness and freedom and these were also the founding values of Independent Reserve. The behavior shown by the team behind BSV has been completely counter to these ideals, repeatedly spreading misinformation and making baseless threats against the community. Recent talk of legal action against developers working to improve the Bitcoin ecosystem proved to be the final straw. These are the actions of a bully and they must stop.""      Przelozny's comments appear, in part, to reference threats by high-profile BSV proponent Craig Wright to sue entities hosting the Bitcoin white paper online, claiming he owns the copyright. Earlier this month, Wright sent take-down letters from his lawyers to several entities, with Bitcoin Core – bitcoin's primary developer team – complying in the face of a costly legal battle.      Wright controversially claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, but has yet prove his claim to the satisfaction of most in the community and media, bar some supporters of BSV. Wright also claims BSV ""is bitcoin,"" making the claim in the title of his blog.      See also: What Is the Bitcoin White Paper?      The Bitcoin white paper was originally released under the permissive MIT license, meaning anyone is free to use or distribute it. Since Wright sent out his legal letters, a number of notable entities have hosted the white paper, including Square (SQ), the city of Miami and the governmental websites of Colombia and Estonia.

42385801,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOKD3,1611804607,"Mark Cuban on Bitcoin, NFTs and What Comes Next: 'The Upside Is Truly Unlimited'","Mark Cuban is best known as the billionaire owner of the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks, his participation on ""Shark Tank"" and – in some circles – an occasional commentator on bitcoin.      “Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble. EXACTLY,” Cuban tweeted in January, on the heels of BTC’s jump above $40K. Many saw the thread as bearish on bitcoin, or even bitcoin-hostile.      Cuban continued:    “As during the dot-com bubble ‘the experts’ try to justify whatever the pricing of the day is. Crypto, much like gold, is a supply and demand driven. All the narratives about debasement, fiat, etc. are just sales pitches. The biggest sales pitch is scarcity vs. demand.”    Renowned bitcoin skeptic (and goldbug) Peter Schiff poured gasoline on the fire, replying, “The difference is that some of those early internet stocks actually had real value. So they survived and ultimately thrived. None of the cryptos have any real value so there will be no winners. They will all lose.”      Mark Cuban’s actual take on bitcoin? It can be tough to pinpoint and for many, Cuban’s take matters. It has weight. When people like Cuban give BTC an endorsement or a swipe, this adds or subtracts legitimacy in the eyes of the. non-crypto-twitter crowd.      And that's why Cuban's Wednesday tweet, in the midst of GameStop (GME) mania, raised eyebrows.      Whatever the billionaire's misgivings about the bitcoin market, he's all-in on nonfungible tokens (NFT) and other blockchain-based ideas for his Dallas Mavericks. ""You can sell anything digital using NFT,"" he tells CoinDesk, hinting at plans to sell an array of digital goods soon.      We know that Cuban has bought bitcoin and still owns bitcoin, but we also know that he once said, “I’d rather have bananas than bitcoin” because he “could eat bananas. Bitcoin, not so much.”      Then again, his take is more nuanced. Even in his ranty “EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble” thread, he took the time to reply to Schiff, offering a quasi-defense of crypto: “What value does any collectible have other than in the eye of the buyer? Why would a digital collectible be any different?”      Cuban has always had a nose and gift for provocation. This is, after all, the same Mark Cuban who once got into a fake fight with a fake referee as an April Fool’s joke, was slapped with a $500,000 fine for an on-court tirade, and did his own stunts on the set of ""Sharknado 3,"" where he played the President of the United States because ... of course.      These taunts seem to continue with bitcoin. Could we have a President Mark Cuban? In early January, he tweeted that he’ll run for president if the price of bitcoin cracks $1 million. Specifically, “I’ll run if BTC gets to $1m AND we can get commitments to donate 350 BTC to the Treasury each of the 4 yrs so that we can give 1 satoshi to every citizen each yr, that they must hold for 10 years. How's that sound :)”      So what’s actually going on here?      Is Cuban a bitcoin skeptic or bull?      Is he serious about running for president?      To clarify his thoughts on bitcoin and the overall blockchain space, I exchanged a few emails with the billionaire entrepreneur. He shares some advice on what to when HODLing, reveals the Mavs have plans for NFTs, says he sees potential in decentralized finance (DeFi), and for those of you hoping for a Cabinet position in the Cuban Administration – sorry – he admits he was mostly “screwing around.”      Oh, and as for the overall blockchain space, Cuban thinks “the upside is truly unlimited.”      CoinDesk: My understanding is you bought bitcoin way back in the early days of Coinbase and still haven’t sold. (Congrats, btw.) Is this accurate?      Mark Cuban: I actually was given some back then. I bought some along the way.      How have your thoughts on bitcoin evolved since then?      Cuban: Hasn't changed a bit. I never thought it was anything more than a store of value.      You’ve tweeted that “Along the way MANY fortunes will be made and LOST and we find out who has the stomach to HODL and who doesn’t. My advice? Learn how to hedge.” Can you unpack what you mean, exactly, by learning how to hedge?      Cuban: Most people can't handle volatility whether it's stocks or crypto. But more importantly, as the price of BTC goes up there is an increasing pressure. It's hard to spend $35K on a single BTC and not get nervous.      What do you mean by pressure?      Cuban: The same pressure that comes with any investment. What will I do if it goes down. And the ""oh f**k, this s**t just dropped $10K in five hours, WTF!"" “My wife is going to kill me,” or “That’s more than I made in three months.” That kind of pressure.      Now imagine you just borrowed $100K against your house, because your friend told you BTC could go to $100K by the end of the year. You borrow, you buy let’s say 3 BTC on Coinbase. But what you didn’t tell your friend is that you can’t afford the payments on that BTC loan. [You think] it only goes up. So you plan to sell a little bit of the BTC every month to pay it off. You get the confirmation. You are all excited because the last week it’s been going up $3K a day or more! Then boom. S**t craters to $28K and you just lost $15K in 15 hours. You are still having to make that loan payment. And you are freaked out.      Totally freaked out.      Cuban: Now some people would say they should have known better. But it’s not that it’s different than the stock market; the same thing can happen [with equities]. But this is why I said it’s like the internet stock boom.      People were rushing in, thinking it could only go up. That the internet stocks would not go down. Until they did and people got crushed. One minute you are a millionaire on paper, the next minute your loan on your house gets called.      And the same happens to professional investors as well. They margin because the trend is their friend, and then it’s not. It blows up on them. HODLers don’t care. They have their stash already. But to everyone else getting involved, the volatility is high stress.      If you are going to play the game you have to know how to use options, even though they aren't that liquid. Even if it’s just selling some of the volatility with calls as a way to cover some of your downside.      Interesting. Have you done this?      Cuban: This isn’t something I have done yet, but it’s something I certainly have explored.      You also said in the same Twitter thread that “the biggest sales pitch is scarcity vs. demand.”… That BTC, by its design, is scarce and people want it, so when more people want it the price goes up. But is that a bad thing? Isn’t that a feature, not a bug? In other words, how is gold any different?      Cuban: It’s exactly the same. No one really needs gold jewelry. Nor does anyone really need BTC.      Do you think bitcoin will ever be used for anything outside of an investment vehicle?      Cuban: Sure. If DeFi and BTC can evolve together in a manner that allows BTC to effectively be a bank account without the bank. That creates utility for BTC. But right now there are so many products being created, it's going to be the wild west for a while      How about ETH? It seems like there are many potential use cases, no?      Cuban: I like ETH. Obviously it's a primary foundation for DeFi and we will see what happens with ETH [2.0].      The Carolina Panthers’ Russell Okung [of the National Football League] is now being paid in bitcoin. Have any Dallas Mavericks [players] expressed interest in being compensated in bitcoin? Do you think that’s something more athletes will pursue in the future? If so, would you be open to it?      Cuban: He isn't really getting paid in crypto. He converts his cash. It's a non-event but a fun story.      You’ve famously (and hilariously) said that you would run for president if BTC hits $1 million. Were you just screwing around or are you serious?      Cuban: Screwing around, but I do think every American citizen should have a digital account that can hold money, stocks and any digital currency/crypto.      On that note, what do you think are the chances that BTC gets to $1 mil? More broadly, what do you think is the most likely fate of bitcoin?      Cuban: Depends on how many people and institutions replace gold with BTC, and whether DeFi becomes a real bank alternative that anyone can use. The problem is that the whales control the game. There are not enough big owners of bitcoin. Too much is in too few hands. That creates market liquidity and market maker challenges.      You’ve said that bitcoin is not a hedge against doomsday scenarios. Can you elaborate on why?      Cuban: Why is it? Just because the narrative is it's a hedge doesn't make it so, any more than gold is a hedge against inflation.      Thoughts on the DeFi boom?      Cuban: It has a shot. We have to get through the wild west period, but there is so little friction in transactions vs traditional banking. If they can get away from fear of [know your customer] and other regulations and let the products leverage their advantages, it really could change banking dramatically.      But I'm not sure that BTC is the beneficiary. It’s too volatile. It's hard to make a deposit of $200 and then in three hours it's worth $175.      Which, in turn, goes back to the efficiently of the markets and exchanges.    If they can get away from fear of KYC and other regulations, and let the products leverage their advantages, it really could change banking, dramatically.    In 2018, you told CoinDesk that the Mavericks would begin accepting bitcoin and ethereum in the following season. What happened with that plan?      Cuban: I wanted to see how many people wanted to use it as a currency. Next to nobody did.      Do you see any future for blockchain in the NBA or sports in general? Tokenization projects? A MAVS coin?      Cuban: Digital goods for sure.      Can you give a few potential examples?      Cuban: You can sell anything digital using NFT. We can sell virtual Mavs gear, sneakers, art, pictures, videos, experiences, anything our imagination can come up with we can sell. We are looking at adding virtual jewelry, accessories and clothing that we create to real pictures in social media. So you can add cool Mavs virtual sneakers that look as real as the ones on your feet to your posts.      The challenge is creating the market. It’s starting to build up some with sneakers, art and special event pictures, but it can and should be so much more. I just don't know when it becomes a real business. But this is an area I’m looking to invest in.      Anything you learned about the blockchain space from your experience backing the initial coin offering launch of Unkoin Gold?      Cuban: I wasn't active in that at all.      What’s your hope for bitcoin and the blockchain space?      Cuban: The upside is truly unlimited. It is a platform for any number of amazing applications that outperform their traditional finance counterparts.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/28/mark-cuban-on-bitcoin-nfts-and-what-comes-next-the-upside-is-truly-unlimited,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45c73b2ccc8b0d422e471e2d2ae2a932f3f7df83-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
