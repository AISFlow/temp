9421788,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4578311-ripple-february-update-sec-final-arguments?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1676416839,"Ripple February Update: ODL Data, Buyback Theory, LBC Price Surge, SEC Final Arguments","Summary Ripple's XRP still has a unique medium-term profit opportunity because of the SEC lawsuit. Unlike most crypto, the XRP price is still languishing. The LBRY Credits coin price action foreshadows what could happen with XRP this year. There's no compelling news of ODL or CBDC adoption this quarter to change my long-term outlook. Settlement with the SEC could happen, but Ripple still is negotiating for clarity on XRP and penalties that don't put the company out of business. My first article makes the case there's not enough real-world adoption to justify a long-term position in Ripple's XRP token ( XRP-USD ). But buying now while the price is depressed from the SEC lawsuit and selling on news of a settlement or legal victory does make sense. In this update, we'll look at the price action for XRP, examine any further evidence of ODL and CBDC adoption, and check the latest on the SEC case. Market update and price action XRP has not benefited from the recent run-up in price in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and most other coins. Check the 3-month BTC chart: BTC 3 month chart (Coingecko) Most other coins are similar but XRP is mired in a trading range of $.32 to $.42. Why hasn't it enjoyed the same breakout as most crypto? The most likely cause is the overhang from the ongoing SEC lawsuit, now over two years old. XRP 3 month chart (Coingecko) Could a Ripple court victory repeat LBRY Credit's price action for XRP? In March of 2021 the SEC alleged LBRY sold their LBC token ( LBC-USD ) as an unregistered security. Late last year, the court ruled in favor of the SEC and classified the initial sale of LBC tokens as investment contracts. However, during this latest hearing the judge clarified that the previous ruling only applied to the direct sale, not the secondary sales. In a January 30th ruling , The judge in a case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against decentralized publishing platform LBRY Inc. ruled that the secondary sale of the LBRY Credits cryptocurrency, or LBC, does not qualify as the sale of a security. This exonerated LBC in the eyes of investors and the token price immediately spiked 80% and later to 280%! Check out the chart: LBC Jan 30-Feb 1 (Coingecko) The hope of XRP holders is that this precedent will also hold for the SEC lawsuit with Ripple: designating only the initial sale of XRP as unregistered securities and clearing the way for unencumbered secondary sales. There was much online speculation that the XRP price would perform exactly like LBC, and I agree. But check the price action after the exuberance waned. LBC February chart (Coingecko) In the opinion of this humble writer, the XRP price action will exactly match the LBC chart trend -- a huge spike on news and then an inexorable decline as retail buyers realize there's no ""there there"" and sell off. I wrote about this in my first Ripple article : History shows a distinct and repeated pattern of price increases with any glimmer of good news in the SEC case. For example, in April 2021, Ripple won a legal battle for access to SEC discussions on defining crypto assets as securities. That news coincided with an explosive 75% rally in 30 hours. Then, XRP jumped 13% on May 30, 2021, when Ripple stopped the SEC from accessing certain legal records. In October 2021, Judge Sarah Netburn issued a ruling in favor of Ripple Labs, which triggered a 17% rally in XRP's price. How is ODL progressing? In Ripple's latest quarterly report we read: On Demand Liquidity (ODL), Ripple’s crypto-enabled cross-border payments solution, launched in France, Sweden and Africa, now available in nearly 40 payouts markets. Ripple has processed nearly $30B worth of volume and 20M transactions since RippleNet was first launched. In 2022, approximately 60% of those payments were sent through ODL. It's good news that ODL is now available in close to 40 markets. The Q4 Report did not update numbers for RippleNet's run rate, last projected at $15 billion for the year 2022, but did disclose that about 60% of payments are ODL. So we can estimate ODL transactions at $9B for 2022. At this volume, RippleNet's volume is still not a threat to the SWIFT network's huge trillion dollar a day market share and has little effect on the token price. Is the Bank of England using Ripple to develop the Digital Pound? Social media influencers have recently claimed that the Bank of England is using Ripple for their Digital Pound project according to an HM Treasury paper . Some media outlets also stated this as a fact. But what does the document actually say? It referenced the completed 2017 proof of concept but it did not indicate any current work with Ripple. Conversely the Technology document specifically names Ethereum and Avalanche (AVAX-USD) (page 74) as networks for consideration. Will the XRP Buyback Theory make XRP holders rich? This idea - proposed by Jimmy Vallee of Valhil Capital in 2021 - says the global financial system must have a scalable digital asset to address the massive national debt currently plaguing most countries. He believes XRP is best positioned to solve this predicament by becoming the world's reserve currency. But to enact this plan, governments would need to obtain large amounts of XRP ostensibly purchased from retail holders like you and me. XRP’s 100 billion tokens would then replace the entire monetary supply for the world. Vallee calculates the buyback rate for XRP between $37,500 and $50,000 per token! This theory is entirely speculative with little real supporting evidence but it's a great example of what passes for research by online influencers. Banks and governments will surely opt for more easily created stablecoin assets which are custom designed at lower cost. But hey, imagine only needing a paltry 27 XRP (about $11) to eventually make you a millionaire and just 27,000 XRP to get into the billionaire club! It could happen, right? No, this is pure hopium . National Australia Bank to Launch Stablecoin on Ethereum, Algorand The National Australia Bank announced that it will launch a new stablecoin backed by the Australian dollar. The stablecoin will allow real-time blockchain settlements using Australian dollars on the Ethereum and Algorand (ALGO-USD) networks according to the NAB's Howard Silby. It is also being considered for cross-border payments. This NAB action follows a 2022 effort by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, ANZ, to create a stablecoin pegged to the Aussie dollar. It used an Ethereum Virtual Machine ((EVM))-compatible smart contract deployed through the Fireblocks platform. Currently, there are just two CBDC projects that have announced partnerships with Ripple. Palau and Bhutan . From the original 2021 Palau press release: The partnership will initially focus on developing strategies for cross-border payments and a USD-backed digital currency for Palau. This could see the implementation of the world's first government-backed national stablecoin in the first half of 2022 for which Ripple would provide Palau with technical, business, design and policy support. This declared target to launch a stablecoin in Palau was missed, and I've seen no further updates. The Bhutan project was the first announcement of plans to explore use of Ripple's CBDC Private Ledger but again there's been no additional info since the initial press release. When will the SEC lawsuit be resolved? On December 2nd of last year, both Ripple and the SEC filed their redacted replies in support of their respective motions for summary judgment. Judge Annalisa Torres has not yet set a date for the next hearing. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated , We’re optimistic that this will certainly be resolved in 2023, and maybe [in] the first half. So we’ll see how it plays out from here. But I feel very good about where we are relative to the law and the facts. We have always said that we would love to settle, but it requires one very important thing, and that is that, on a go-forward basis, it’s clear that XRP is not a security. Settlement to avoid trial is still possible, but Ripple is intent on a result which clarifies XRP as a non-security. The amount of fines may also be under negotiation. The SEC has handed out heavy crypto related penalties in the past several years. Ripple's massive treasuries could embolden the SEC to levy the largest fines yet -- perhaps approaching the billion dollar range. But if the fines are too great, Ripple may be put out of business. The other thing to consider is what would happen if Ripple flat out loses against the SEC? In an interview with Axios at Collision 2022 , Garlinghouse makes the argument thats the XRP price already reflects this scenario. ""If Ripple loses the case, does anything change? It’s basically just status quo."" Vauld update In my May update, I introduced an exchange called Vauld that not only listed XRP but also paid up to 6.7% interest. I had my XRP on deposit there when Vauld closed withdrawals due to market concerns. It's been 8 months and creditors disgruntled by the Vauld management's lack of direction have banned together to form the Vauld Creditors Alliance : The Vauld Creditors Alliance (VCA) launched in February 2023 as a group of Vauld creditors with the common goal to initiate and implement a creditor-driven solution to the restructuring of The Vauld Group of companies. The VCA's mission is to research, report, and act on matters pertaining to the restructuring of Vauld and its legal entity Defi Payments Ltd. The goal of the VCA is to ensure Vauld creditors at large and VCA members in particular receive accurate information, swift action, and fair treatment resulting in maximum return of creditor funds at the lowest cost. Like many caught in similar situations with Celsius (CEL-USD), BlockFi, and Voyager (VYGVQ), I await the Vauld bankruptcy and legal proceedings with diminished expectations about retrieving my coins. However, since my conviction for the Ripple trade remains strong, I've recently repurchased my XRP bag. Conclusion The LBC coin security clarification, subsequent price spike and decline is more reason to sell on the news. There's no new evidence that XRP has value as a long-term holding. In fact, the Bank of England and National Australia Bank projects show institutions are considering Ethereum and other networks instead of XRP. Without settlement, the SEC overhang on XRP price could extend well into 2023 as we await further legal action to grind slowly forward.",NEUTRAL,ETH | XRP,ETH | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4578311-ripple-february-update-sec-final-arguments?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9421788.jpeg

42393846,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQxsZ,1676413627,Crypto Markets Analysis: CPI Data Shakes Crypto Markets Before Cooler Heads Prevail,"Crypto prices moved back and forth as inflation slowed at a lesser rate than expected.  Bitcoin sank in the first hour following the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ release of the January consumer price ondex (CPI), which showed prices rising 6.4% versus projections for 6.2%. Then bitcoin returned above $22,000, the level it had lost five days ago. BTC was recently trading at about $22,200, up more than 3% over the past 24 hours.  Crypto markets’ resilience underscores a new, albeit faint, optimism about inflation and the economy. The crypto Fear and Greed Index has been holding firmly in neutral territory for much of the past few weeks after weeks of lingering at extreme fear levels.  Despite the tepid decline, the CPI has now sunk seven consecutive months, implying the Federal Reserve’s efforts to stem inflation are yielding positive results. Things appear to be moving in the right direction.  Inflation has fallen from 9.1% to 6.4% since June 2022, even if it remains three times higher than the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2% target.  Consumers continue to feel the strain related to inflation. The CPI report showed that prices increased across the board, except for used cars.  On Tuesday, bitcoin and ether seesawed before holding fast at their current levels. Trading volume was light later in the day despite the increased volatility.  Bitcoin’s price moves stem from where BTC currently trades more than on any data release. Volume near bitcoin’s current range between $21,500 and $22,500 has been low, compared to high levels of volume at $20,000 and $23,000. Oftentimes prices will drift away from these lower volume ranges and land in areas where there has been greater historic activity  When an asset trades within these volume “valleys,” prices can often move rapidly in either direction. This appears to be the case when viewing BTC’s hourly chart throughout Tuesday.  The erratic moves on bitcoin’s hourly chart are difficult to see over BTC’s daily time frame.  Here we find a more orderly display of movement – a moderate increase on slightly above average volume. While the CPI data rocked the boat temporarily, as the day progressed calmer waters ensued.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/14/crypto-markets-analysis-cpi-data-shakes-crypto-markets-before-cooler-heads-prevail,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6399649c2d6e0e82c3b4483be9730967ab106c8b-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42388080,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR49hp,1676413612,Fewer Than Half of New Ethereum Blocks Over the Past 24 Hours Are OFAC Compliant,"After the U.S. government blacklisted Tornado Cash transactions for U.S. people in August, there was a swift response by validators on the Ethereum blockchain to exclude sanctioned transactions. For many in the crypto industry, such moves were decried as censorship – directly counter to the vision of a decentralized network free from government interference.  Now, however, the trend is going the other way, and more blocks with Tornado Cash are going through even if they’re not compliant with U.S. Treasury Dept. sanctions.  According to an MEV watchdog site, just 49% of blocks that made it onto the Ethereum blockchain over the past 24 hours were OFAC-compliant, meaning the blocks excluded transactions that have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.  This is a significant decrease in censorship from Ethereum’s past. Ethereum hit an all-time high for censorship on Nov. 21, when 79% of blocks relayed on Ethereum excluded OFAC-sanctioned transactions. The last time that Ethereum’s censored blocks were below 50% was Oct.16.  Put another way, that means that more than half of the blocks that made it onto the Ethereum blockchain over the last 24 hours are non-OFAC compliant.  So what has reversed Ethereum’s censorship course?  MEV-Boost contributed to Ethereum’s censorship problem  Since Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake in September (known as the Merge), most of the blocks that make it onto the blockchain go through a middleware component known as MEV-Boost, which is a software that allows validators to request pre-made blocks from builders.  MEV-Boost came into existence to help validators earn MEV, or Maximal Extractible Value, which are profits derived from including or reordering transactions within a block.  The software was built by Flashbots, an Ethereum research and development team, in order to democratize MEV among validators and skirt issues of centralization.  Flashbots has succeeded in having MEV-Boost used across the ecosystem, as 96% of validators today have relayed blocks via the middleware. The firm also runs its own relayer, which is used by 68% of validators.  But a new set of issues, mainly censorship, arose with MEV-Boost after OFAC blacklisted Tornado Cash transactions for U.S. people in August.  As a result of the sanctioning, relayers using MEV-Boost deliver to their connected validators only pre-built blocks without Tornado Cash transactions included. In other words, MEV-Boost was censoring blocks by default.  Read more: Is Ethereum’s Censorship Problem Taking a Turn?  Has the censorship course reversed?  The push for validators to connect to other relayers that are not Flashbots’ has been at the center of reversing Ethereum’s censorship course.  Today, 68% of blocks relayed have been done via Flashbots. As recently as December, that number was at 74%. Before Flashbots began censoring Tornado Cash transactions following the Merge, it open-sourced the code so that others could develop their own non-censoring relays.  There are now seven relayers that are noncensoring. Those include two of BloXroute’s relayers (max profit and ethical), Ultrasound, Agnostic Gnosis, Manifold, Relayoor and Aestus.  Martin Köppelmann, a censorship-resistance advocate and the co-founder of Gnosis Chain, which also runs a noncensoring relayer, shared in a tweet that the decline in censorship is partially thanks to BloXroute, Ultrasound and Gnosis since they make up most of the uncensored block space.  Köppelmann told CoinDesk that he believes this “is good news and I am happy Gnosis is contributing, but I also believe Ethereum censorship resistance should not depend on so few entities.”  Read more: Is Ethereum’s Censorship Problem Taking a Turn?",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/14/fewer-than-half-of-new-ethereum-blocks-over-the-past-24-hours-are-ofac-compliant,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c7a5821b8daa785dd58a9783acdbd9ea673c18f-528x396.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388069,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR491j,1676407439,Bitcoin Rebounds Above $22K After Tepid Inflation Readings,"Bitcoin regained a foothold comfortably above $22,000, despite tepid January U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading over $22,200, a more than 3% gain during the past 24 hours. BTC had been lingering below $22,000 for the previous five days amid growing investor concerns about stablecoin regulation and U.S. central bank inflation-fighting measures.  January’s CPI rose 0.5% versus 0.1% a month earlier, in line with economist forecasts. But on a year-over-year basis inflation ran hotter than hoped, arriving at 6.4% pace versus 6.5% in December and against predictions for 6.2%. Year-over-year core CPI – which strips away more volatile food and energy costs – was faster than forecast at 5.6% versus 5.5% expected and down from 5.7% a month earlier.  The data suggested that the Federal Reserve would remain hawkish with more interest rate hikes in the offing at upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. The CME FedWatch tool currently shows that around 90% of traders see the FOMC raising rates by 25 basis points in March.  Investor reaction fluctuated significantly in the immediate aftermath of the CPI release with bitcoin (BTC) initially dropping on the news and quickly surging by $700 to trade as high as $22,300 before retreating slightly to its current level.  “The market might be pricing in a little more Fed tightening but that isn’t weighing that much on cryptos today,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Tuesday note. “Regulation and contagion risks have pressured Bitcoin this month, so the downward move was potentially exhausted.”  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value, surged nearly 5% from Monday, same time, to trade above $1,550, regaining losses from recent days. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures the overall crypto market performance, was recently up 3.7% for the day.  Equities markets were mixed, with the S&P 500 index recently rising 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%.  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk that he wouldn't be surprised to see post-CPI-release gains dissipate by the end of this week. DiPasquale highlighted that crypto prices have typically risen after past CPI releases in the past “only to fall in the days after.” He said he will be looking for BTC and ETH to test $20,000 and $1,250, respectively.  Michael Safai, managing partner at quantitative trading firm Dexterity Capital, noted in an emailed comment that regulation now trumps inflation concerns in crypto markets.  “It could very well be that inflation data and Fed meetings won’t have the same push-pull effect on crypto prices that they did in 2022, because regulation is fast becoming the bigger influence on sentiment in crypto.""  Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at STORM Partners, told CoinDesk that BTC's recent drop and rebound Tuesday were ""relatively muted, with only a few hundred dollars on each side.""  ""This was one of the calmest CPI days in recent months,"" Ahmed said. “The last CPI print was lower, which, in part, induced the January rally; but with the opposite results today, markets may become more unpredictable.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/14/bitcoin-rebounds-above-22k-after-tepid-inflation-readings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83f59d5226ee0fd2efa9c84b7528b2ccdd1718a5-1156x582.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The CPI data pointed to more persistent inflation than what markets had priced in in recent months, potentially leading the Federal Reserve to extend its battle against price pressures via more interest-rate increases than projected. At the onset of the CPI release, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) actually edged lower -- as would be expected -- by as much as 0.4% to $21.59K, only to erase those losses later in the morning and then perk up 2.4% to $22.20K as of 3:34 p.m. ET. Ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) intraday price action echoed that of BTC, now up 4.6% to $1.55K. Crypto traders also seemed to have shook off fears of increased stablecoin regulation, which has put some downward pressure on prices in recent days. ""The lack of clarity on the regulatory treatment of stablecoins in the U.S. could have significant impacts on the industry,"" Cristiano Ventricelli, assistant vice president at Moody’s Investors Service, told Seeking Alpha in an emailed statement. ""Capital may migrate to stablecoins issued in jurisdictions with more tailored regulatory frameworks,"" he added. ""Also, this may result in capital migration to jurisdictions with higher risk tolerance, which could lead to more exotic products that carry higher risks."" Stablecoin issuer Paxos Trust Company earlier this week was ordered by the New York Department of Financial Services to cease minting of new dollar-pegged BUSD ( BUSD-USD ) tokens. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also sent Paxos a Wells Notice earlier this month claiming BUSD is an unregistered security. ""Regardless of whether the SEC is going after Binance specifically or if this is just the first of many shots from the SEC, this is a problem for crypto ,"" said Seeking Alpha contributor Mike Fay.

Like BUSD, Paxos is also the issuer of USDP - which did not generate a Wells Notice from the SEC. Regardless of whether the SEC is going after Binance specifically or if this is just the first of many shots from the SEC, this is a problem for crypto. Asset prices didn't reflect much of a change in the crypto market on Monday, but something fairly significant did take place. It started with Paxos Trust Company announcing Monday morning that it will no longer be minting Binance USD ( BUSD-USD ) and would be ending its relationship with Binance. According to the press release, Paxos is taking this step as a result of working with the NYDFS: Effective February 21, Paxos will cease issuance of new BUSD tokens as directed by and working in close coordination with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Paxos Trust, a regulated institution overseen by the NYDFS and audited by a top-four accounting firm, will continue to manage BUSD dollar reserves. While minting is done, Paxos will continue redemption of BUSD and maintains that the token is still fully backed 1:1 and in segregated accounts. Paxos mints BUSD when a depositor sends dollars to Paxos. Paxos then custodies those dollars and creates the stablecoin dollar derivative BUSD for dollar-denominated activity on crypto rails. No Peg Issues Yet As of writing, BUSD is the 7th largest crypto coin in the entire market with a $15.6 billion market cap - though that market cap is well off the high of $23.5 billion in November of last year: BUSD Market Cap (CoinMarketCap) Despite that large level of redemption in a very short amount of time, BUSD's peg has never gone below a $0.9996 level at any point in the last 3 months. This could be seen as an indication that there has been nearly no concern about Paxos' ability to provide redemptions. In the instance of BUSD, the primary rails where the token exists are Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and to a lesser extent Binance Smart Chain ( BNB-USD ), but there are numerous smaller chains with BUSD support as well. BUSD Chain Breakout (Defi Llama) Before Paxos' BUSD minting announcement could even really be digested by the market, the company shared another press release late Monday. The SEC Wells Notice In a rather stunning announcement late Monday afternoon, Paxos disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission sent the company a Wells Notice earlier this month and made the claim that BUSD is an unregistered security. This Wells Notice is significant because it means the SEC is investigating or has finished an investigation into BUSD and enforcement action is a highly likely next step. Paxos disagrees with the SEC's position: Paxos categorically disagrees with the SEC staff because BUSD is not a security under the federal securities laws. This SEC Wells Notice pertains only to BUSD. To be clear, there are unequivocally no other allegations against Paxos. The important thing to note from Paxos' statement is the Wells notice does not impact Pax Dollar ( USDP-USD ). This is very interesting because USDP and BUSD are functionally the same; they are both dollar-collateralized stablecoins that are minted and managed by Paxos. The biggest difference that I can find between the two coins is that one is a Binance-branded product that relies on the Binance Smart Chain for most of its utility, and the other is not. Is This More About Binance? From where I sit, there are a few viable possibilities at play; either there are many more Wells Notices coming, there is something wrong with Binance specifically in the eyes of the SEC, or the SEC is being arbitrary and capricious. The latter of which is something that Grayscale has already accused the SEC of being. But it may realistically be something about Binance specifically that the SEC doesn't like. BUSD is used on Binance Smart Chain to a large degree. Even though Binance only accounts for 30% of the BUSD in circulation, it is by far the largest dollar stablecoin on the network: BSC Stablecoin Share (DeFi Llama) Accounting for over 53% of the $9 billion in US dollar stablecoins on Binance Smart Chain, BSC is reliant on BUSD to a large degree for DeFi activity: Network Stables Mcap Dominant Stablecoin Dominance Ethereum $80.0b USDC 42.5% Tron ( TRON-USD ) $37.9b USDT 94.5% Binance $9.0b BUSD 53.1% Solana ( SOL-USD ) $1.8b USDC 53.1% Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) $1.7b USDC 47.8% Source: DeFi Llama In fact, no other blockchain with a top 10 stablecoin market cap relies on BUSD as its dominant stablecoin. Most of them are using USDC. This does suggest that the SEC may see some sort of problem with Binance specifically. Otherwise, there could be more wrath coming to the broader stablecoin market. If it is About Stablecoins, We Have Problems In many ways, stablecoins are the ""killer app"" in crypto. The main purpose of stablecoins is for dollar-denominated activity on crypto rails. Those activities can be for anything from DeFi lending, taking profit in crypto native assets trades, merchant services, or yes, even potentially illicit activity. The latter of which is less likely over time since the blockchains are transparent and smart contract deployments can bake-in the ability to freeze assets. This is why we've seen a surge in banned addresses over the last couple of years: Banned addresses (Dune Analytics/KARTOD) The major issuers of these fiat-backed stablecoins like Circle or Paxos generally practice KYC/AML compliance. These financial instruments can serve perfectly legitimate purposes, and stablecoins are something that I explored with BlockChain Reaction subscribers just last week . They enable incredibly cheap, fast payments on the network layer regardless of the software interface the user chooses. If their utility in the United States is regulated away, I would argue the biggest winners would be the centralized peer-to-peer payment apps owned by companies like PayPal ( PYPL ) and Block, Inc. ( SQ ). Summary We don't yet know for certain if this Wells Notice Paxos received is about stablecoins broadly speaking or about Binance specifically. At least for now, it looks like it could be more about Binance. If that's the case, I'd be very careful about exposure to BNB or any highly Binance-exposed applications. I would also caution any crypto advocate who may not think this is a big deal to seriously ponder the implications of what is happening right now. Many have argued the federal government is orchestrating a coordinated crackdown on the entire crypto industry that intensified in December a few weeks after FTX ( FTT-USD ) collapsed. If it is indeed found that BUSD is an unregistered security, it stands to reason that every fiat-collateralized stablecoin is also an unregistered security since their minting mechanisms are all very similar. This would include USDP, Circle's USD Coin ( USDC-USD ), and Tether ( USDT-USD ). If all of those stablecoins are found to also be unregistered securities, we would likely see an enormous outflow from fiat-backed stables and a few things will probably happen: weaker stablecoins could lose dollar pegs decentralized stables could see inflows native assets could see inflows non-USD fiat-collateralized stables could see inflows Crypto value could leave the ecosystem entirely On point number four, there are other jurisdictions that are far more friendly to crypto and the innovations that could ultimately happen in this industry may go offshore. But the larger point is there is well over $100 billion in the USD fiat-collateralized stablecoin market. If the minting of additional USD fiat-backed stables is stopped by the SEC, the redemptions will begin and that value will flow somewhere else. I think native assets would catch a bid. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) would likely catch a bid as well. But even decentralized stablecoins or stablecoins of other fiat currencies could see activity. The coins that are truly backed 1:1 shouldn't see massive peg fluctuations. But the stables that aren't fully backed may have peg problems. Right or wrong from a legality standpoint, I personally think Paxos' BUSD Wells Notice is just the beginning.",NEGATIVE,BNB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4578236-binance-usd-wells-notice-is-big-deal-for-all-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9415153.jpeg

What the federal agency is doing is regulating “almost entirely through enforcement actions,” Le, a former chief counsel for the SEC’s Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” Tuesday.  “When the SEC tells us that something is not compliant, it’s not necessarily the same thing as telling us what they would consider compliant,” Le said in reference to the $30 million settlement the agency reached with Kraken, under which the centralized exchange will shutter its staking service platform to U.S. customers.  In Kraken’s case, Le said, there are still questions about the agency’s stance on staking services, such as whether other forms of staking services, including self-staking and decentralized staking, would fall within the agency’s guidelines.  “We don’t necessarily know just from a single enforcement action or even through multiple enforcement actions,” Le said. “Any single action, like the one against Kraken, can be limited in terms of what we can learn from it and what it means for other staking service providers.”  The Paxos case  The SEC issued a Wells Notice that it would be filing suit against stablecoin issuer Paxos for its alleged sale of an unregistered security, stablecoin token Binance USD (BUSD). Paxos, however, has said it “categorically disagrees” with the agency, claiming that its Binance-branded token is backed one-to-one.  Le said in the case of Paxos, the SEC may not be applying the securities definition of the Howey Test to the BUSD stablecoin but a different set of criteria through the Reves test.  ""Enforcement actions are very facts- and circumstances-specific, so it can be difficult to know how broadly to read any single action,"" she said. ""For instance, it can be hard to discern how heavily the SEC weighs particular facts when applying Howey, it can even be hard to discern – if the complaint doesn't contain a fulsome analysis – which facts even apply to which Howey factors.""  By ""blindly and mechanically applying the existing securities laws"" without considering the potential of digital assets and blockchain technology, the SEC ""could potentially just kill something like staking.""  As for trying to comply with the SEC, ""it's actually not as simple as going onto the SEC's website and filling out a form and then you're good to go. Applying the federal securities laws to something like staking services, where a provider takes your crypto and does things with it, that actually raises really novel and complex questions around custody.""

But the company says its new design reflects forward thinking on the tightest possible security measures and user-friendly features gleaned from customer feedback.  The soon-to-be-released device, dubbed Coldcard Q1, became available for pre-ordering on Feb. 9 and comes with a full keyboard, an LCD screen and an LED-illuminated QR code scanner.  The waffle-phone-style QWERTY keyboard gives off strong 2002 BlackBerry vibes and is supposed to cut down on so-called fat-finger errors when entering sensitive passwords, PINs and passphrases.  Read more: Wasabi Wallet Will Pay You to 'Crack' a Bitcoin Wallet  Coinkite added a battery compartment on the Q1’s rear side that fits three AAA batteries, so there’s no need for a tethered power supply, although a USB-C port is available for customers who prefer using a power cord.  It’s the company’s fifth iteration of a bitcoin hardware wallet, following the introduction of the MK line starting in 2018. The most-recent model, the Coldcard MK4, was released in February 2022.  The company aims to crack into the market-leadership ranks of hardware wallet makers, currently dominated by big names including Trezor and Ledger. But the overall market may be growing as more crypto investors seek out hardware wallets as an alternative to simply leaving coins on exchanges.  Outsiders may scoff at the Q1’s bulky, throwback user interface or UX, but Coinkite says it intentionally came up with that anachronistic design after consultations with users of its smaller, slimmer MK4.  The exact size, weight and price of the Q1 will be confirmed in the near future, but eager users can already reserve the device with a $199 deposit. The retail price is not expected to be much higher than the deposit amount.  “The Q1 was built mainly to help less advanced users,” Celia Cherif, a Coinkite business development representative, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We gathered their feedback from the MK4 and made everything more UX friendly for them in the Q1.”  Growing market for hardware wallets  Coinkite’s roots in the Bitcoin space go all the way back to 2011, when co-founders Rodolfo  Novak and Peter Gray stumbled across the Bitcoin white paper and later built a rudimentary bitcoin hardware wallet. The pair eventually incorporated as Coinkite, and the firm now produces and sells a suite of hardware and software Bitcoin products, including the MK4, which Cherif says is Coinkite’s best-selling product.  “Coldcard sales have been higher than expected,” Novak wrote in a tweet. Coinkite declined to provide CoinDesk with official sales data.  Last year’s implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange triggered an exodus of customers from centralized exchanges to self-custody devices.  One crypto publication reported that two of the largest players in the hardware wallet space – Trezor and Ledger – captured a significant share of those spooked customers in November. According to the publication, Trezor reported a 300% increase in week-over-week sales while Ledger saw a six-fold increase in account creations for Ledger Live, the firm’s wallet management software.  Coinkite also saw an uptick in sales, although it’s not clear by how much. “Bitcoiners are so resolute on bitcoin and so many are getting off exchanges,” Novak tweeted. “In all my years, I've never seen so much activity.”  Convenience and 'air-gapping'  The Q1’s design revolves around convenience and security, especially “air-gapping,” which means isolating the device from potentially unsecured networks like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  Cherif says that some less-tech-savvy customers reported difficulties using the MK4. Many customers were fumbling to enter sensitive passphrases, struggling to scan bitcoin address QR codes, dealing with the hassle of connecting power cords and switching back and forth between microSD cards.  With that backdrop, Coinkite designed the Q1 to include two microSD slots for saving wallet seed phrases – a series of 12 to 24 random words used to “recover” or regain private keys in the case of accidental loss. The double microSD slots offer more secure data transfer than traditional USB-A connections (more commonly referred to as simply “USB”), which Cherif says are vulnerable to all sorts of sophisticated cyberattacks.  “There’s a lot of vulnerabilities with USB data connectivity,” Cherif explained. “There's a website created just to monitor all the known vulnerabilities. The list is never-ending. These are vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited by malicious actors.”  The firm’s engineers included both AAA batteries and the USB-C port as power sources for the Q1. Cherif also emphasized that the Q1’s USB-C port is strictly reserved for power transmission and not data transfer.  “If you choose to plug the USB-C cable into an Internet-connected device, it remains a much safer option than a USB cable because it doesn't have any data lines connected, only power,” Cherif said.  Coinkite added a flashlight to the Q1 so users can easily scan Bitcoin QR codes (encoded Bitcoin addresses) in dim lighting.  The wallet has an LED QR code scanner instead of a video camera-based version. Coinkite says the choice was deliberate because cameras, being more technologically complex, are more prone to malicious hacks.  “The thing is, the camera is an attack vector,” Cherif explained.  A few Twitter users perusing details of the new device wondered out loud if the Q1’s large color LCD screen is able to display Ordinals, a new type of on-chain Bitcoin non-fungible token (NFT).  For now, the answer is “no,” although Coinkite is collaborating with Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor on a project that uses a different Coinkite product – the Satschip – for Ordinals provenance (using a Bitcoin private key to prove ownership of an Ordinals NFT).

According to a 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dated Dec. 31, Soros Fund Management purchased 39.6 million worth convertible debentures of crypto miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA). Convertible debentures are types of long-term debt issued by a company that can be converted into stock after a specified period of time.  The fund was also showing ownership of call options and put options on 50,000 shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR). Soros' 13F from three months earlier disclosed only put options on 50,000 shares. In addition to those common stock bets/hedges, the fund continued to hold nearly $200 million in MicroStrategy preferred shares. MicroStrategy could be considered a proxy for holding bitcoin because of the company's large crypto holdings.  A put option gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to sell while a call option gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy.  The bet is likely a hedging strategy on MicroStrategy shares through option play, a trader told CoinDesk.  The fund also disclosed a short position on beleaguered crypto-focused bank Silvergate Bank (SI), holding 100,000 shares worth of put options. The filing being as of the end of 2022, it's unclear now whether Soros Management remains short Silvergate.  The Soros Fund has previously been reported to own bitcoin, during the bull run of 2021.

42388076,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR49Tn,1676402078,NFT Marketplace Blur Releases Native Token for Community Ownership,"After months of anticipation, zero-fee non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur released its native token Tuesday.  The token will allow traders to participate in the platform’s governance protocol, as well as profit from the marketplace’s success through community ownership.  Blur said in a tweet that traders have 60 days to claim their airdropped BLUR tokens, which are trading at roughly 50 cents at press time, according to CoinGecko.  “Since launching [four] months ago, 146,823 users have traded $1.2 billion dollars [sic] worth of NFTs on Blur (wash trading excluded),” Blur said in a tweet. “This growth is breathtaking and was only possible with the support of the Blur community.”  According to data from DappRadar, Blur’s 24-hour trading volume stands at about $9.5 million, second only to leading marketplace OpenSea, whose trading volume is around $12 million.  NFT traders have been awaiting the BLUR token’s release since the platform went live. Originally set to release in January, Blur has been airdropping its token since October through “care packages” to collectors who have traded an Ethereum-based NFT in the past six months. On Tuesday, Blur delayed their token-launch by 90 minutes, warning collectors to be aware of potential phishing attempts and scam links.  Blur launched in October with a strategy to cater to professional NFT traders with a zero-fee marketplace. In its first 24 hours, it conducted $2.5 million in trading volume, creeping up on OpenSea’s trading volume. While the royalty-optional marketplace has added fuel to the fire to the ongoing debate among creators and marketplaces, it has continued to trail behind OpenSea’s trading volume numbers.  According to early data from Dune Analytics, 360 million BLUR tokens have been airdropped to ""care package"" holders. While traders have 60 days to claim their BLUR, over 200 million, or nearly 57% of the token's supply have been claimed.

The implications affect the whole crypto industry. This new regulatory paradigm will create winners and losers. Thesis Summary Crypto is, once again, under attack from regulatory agencies. This time, the SEC is after staking Binance's dollar stablecoin. ( BUSD-USD ), which has halted minting. The Securities and Exchange Commission appears to be making it perfectly clear to the crypto market that it is ready to treat cryptocurrencies as securities, and it is not afraid to take action. This shocking news follows a significant rally off the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) lows, which has renewed bullish sentiment. But even if we are in a new bull, what will the crypto market look like after regulation? Who will be the winners and losers of this new regime? The SEC Attacks Staking And Kraken The first blow came late last week, as crypto exchange Kraken was forced to stop offering staking-as-a-service on its platform and agreed to pay a $30 million fine for the sale of unregistered securities. With staking, crypto holders can earn interest on their coins. This makes cryptocurrencies, in the SEC's mind, a security. It also puts cryptocurrency in direct competition with traditional banking products. Some speculate that this latest push against crypto is an attempt to marginalize the industry. However, there is at least some dissent within the ranks of the SEC. Commissioner Hester Peirce spoke out against the recent actions against Kraken, saying this was ""not an efficient or fair way of regulating"". Crypto developers and investors are scrambling to evade or comply with the laws. There is no shortage of decentralized solutions for staking. One such solution I recently reviewed in my marketplace is RocketPool ( RPL-USD ), which saw a 40% spike in its token's price following the Kraken news. Meanwhile, in preparation for what's to come, Cardano ( ADA-USD ) founder Charles Hoskinson has begun to talk about "" contingent staking "", a form of staking which might better fit regulatory demands. Under the model, Hoskinson noted the transaction certificate would be two-sided, meaning that both the delegate and the staking pool operator would have to sign the transaction before it is processed. Source: finbold.com The SEC Attacks Paxos And Binance However, the actions against Kraken pale compared to the ramifications of the recent actions taken against BUSD. Yesterday, Paxos announced it would stop minting BUSD, following instructions from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This followed a report on Sunday , which stated the SEC was ready to sue Paxos for the sale of unregistered securities. To understand the implications here, we must understand the relationship between Paxos and Binance. Paxos is the ""official"" creator of BUSD, which is a token backed by dollars and issued on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain. However, Paxos has a licensing agreement with Binance, and Binance mints BUSD on its own blockchain, the Binance Smart Chain. This BUSD, however, is not subject to the same regulations and constraints as the BUSD minted by Paxos on Ethereum. In fact, it was revealed that BUSD on the Binance Smart Chain was at one point left undercollateralized by $1 billion . Though from a regulatory standpoint, you could argue it's Paxos being attacked, BUSD is most strongly associated with Binance. It's interesting to note, too, that Paxos has stopped BUSD minting, it is still minting USDP, which is also a dollar stablecoin. Technically. BUSD has lost its peg to the dollar, but this is a negligible difference: BUSD price (CoinMarketCap) BUSD now trades at $0.9993. The peg is being maintained for now, but that doesn't guarantee it won't depeg in the future. The effects have also been felt in Binance's native token BNB ( BNB-USD ). BNB price (CoinMarketCap) BNB is down 11% in the last 24 hours, but this is to be expected given the broader market sell-off. Ethereum, for example, is down 7% in the last day. One thing is for certain, though; crypto is not going to take this lying down. Paxos has said it will fight ""vigorously"" against the SEC lawsuit. The Coinbase CEO also stepped in yesterday, announcing the company will "" Defend Staking in Court if Needed "". The Winners And The Losers This new wave of crypto regulation may have taken the wind out of the current crypto rally, but I still view this as an overall bullish thing for crypto. Let the chips fall where they may, but at least let them fall. Clear regulations will open the door to institutional acceptance and remove uncertainty. With that said, these regulations will create a different playing field and bring about winners and losers. The winners will be those looked on favourably by regulators. This is already becoming very clear. Binance is a foreign company that was initially founded in China. It's quite interesting to see Binance and Kraken get targeted while Coinbase, a publicly traded company held by banks and institutions, has been left relatively alone. Coinbase doesn't have a stablecoin, but it does offer staking products, like Kraken, which are still up and running. In a similar way, Tether ( USDT-USD ) can be seen as the foreign equivalent to Circles USDC ( USDC-USD ). Tether has been subjected to a lot more scrutiny by both regulators and the market, while USDC is generally seen as an innocuous stablecoin. Again, USDT has strong ties to China, while Circle is based in Boston. Also, as has been shown by recent price action, big winners of regulation will be decentralized services and applications, which will be much harder to regulate. RPL, previously mentioned, is an example, and this also extends to decentralized exchanges like Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) Takeaway I believe there is money to be made in crypto, which is why there is an incentive for the government to regulate but not shut down crypto. Coinbase, in my opinion, stands out as a likely winner going forwards. Furthermore, as I have been discussing with my subscribers, it looks like the stock could have put in a meaningful bottom, so this pull-back could be the time to add. While I am still bullish on Binance and BNB, I remain cautious, given the campaign that US regulators are launching against the exchange.",NEUTRAL,BNB,EXCHANGE | ICO | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4578199-sec-delivers-blow-to-binance-great-for-coinbase?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9412587.jpeg

42388070,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR496P,1676397810,Stablecoin Issuer Paxos Burns $700M Binance USD in 27 Hours Amid Regulatory Pressure,"Paxos, the issuer of the $16 billion Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin, has burned more than $700 million of BUSD tokens since Monday.  That was when Paxos announced it would stop issuing the cryptocurrency amid mounting regulatory pressure, blockchain data shows.  Data from blockchain intelligence firm Nansen shows that a Paxos Treasury crypto wallet transferred $703 million worth of BUSD tokens to a burn address within 27 hours starting Monday morning, essentially removing the coins from circulation.  Paxos Treasury sent the first transaction of $144.5 million worth of BUSD at Monday 13:47 UTC, data from blockchain monitoring tool Etherscan shows – less than two hours after the announcement. Eight more transactions followed in the next 27 hours, worth some $559 million.  BUSD is a dollar-pegged stablecoin backed by short-term treasuries and cash-like assets, so holders can redeem the token 1:1 to a U.S. dollar anytime. U.S.-based fintech firm Paxos issues the token according to regulation from the New York Department of Financial Services, the state’s main financial regulatory agency.  The maneuver is a sign of investors exiting BUSD quickly. The $700 million redemption in a little more than a day represents some 6% of the total coins in circulation. Changpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, tweeted Monday that BUSD market capitalization “will only decrease over time.”  News broke on Monday morning that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had sent a Wells notice to the firm for issuing unregistered securities, signaling an imminent enforcement action from the regulator. Meanwhile, the New York Department of Financial Services is probing the firm and has ordered Paxos to stop minting new Binance USD (BUSD) tokens.

42411204,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCMu,1676396103,Dollar Stablecoins Are Great for Users and the US Government,"Mark Hays’ recent opinion piece in CoinDesk titled “Stablecoins Are Not Worth the Risk” is off-base, both in describing the risks and by dismissing the benefits of these novel financial assets. A properly designed dollar coin is safe and desirable, especially for the very people Mr. Hays, a senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform, aims to protect.  Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia University Business School, is the author of several books including “Re-Architecting Trust: The Curse of History and the Crypto Cure for Money, Markets and Platforms.”  First, some history: People have been using claims on a reserve as payment instruments for a thousand years. Paper money itself was originally invented as a receipt for metal held by a bank or money changer. Eventually, merchants realized it was easier to pay each other with the receipts than the metal itself.  See also: Paxos 'Categorically Disagrees' With SEC That BUSD Is a Security  As I explain in my book “Re-Architecting Trust,” that basic design hasn’t changed much in a millennium, and things like bank checks, money orders and mobile payments operate on the same principle. Today, the vast majority of payments are made with transferable claims on a balance sheet.  Fiat-backed stablecoins are no different. Financially speaking, sending someone 100 USDC is no different than sending them $100 via Venmo. In both cases, one user is handing over a claim against a balance sheet – Circle’s versus PayPal’s – to another. From the issuers point of view, each dollar held by its user is just a liability, to be matched against equivalent assets.  So which is safer?  Here's where things get interesting, because from the point of view of safety a properly designed stablecoin is more secure than anything that came before. That’s because half of the balance sheet of the issuer is recorded on-chain and can be verified in trustless fashion.  A good payment provider is one that always matches its assets and liabilities with like-instruments. Regulations and oversight are crucial in making sure they do. For Venmo, this means parent company PayPal’s regulators need to constantly collect data on user balances (liabilities) and check they match reserves in liquid capital (assets). Awkwardly, the primary source of data for PayPal’s liability is PayPal itself.  This is a bit like police officers having to ask drivers how fast they were going before issuing a speeding ticket.  Sure, there are reports and audits (and PayPal has likely always behaved responsibly) but the opacity is unavoidable. Stablecoin issuers are different because their liabilities – the tokens they issue – are visible on-chain. Even Tether, the much-maligned stablecoin issuer, can’t lie about token balances. Here they are.  Mark Hays can’t say the same thing about PayPal.  Instead, Hays focuses on strawman arguments against poorly designed stablecoins like terraUSD – the decentralized stablecoin that maintained its stability with a faulty algorithm. This is a new ecosystem and, like all new industries, bad ideas come (and fail) all the time.  Even the first modern credit card, issued by Bank of America in 1958, was a disaster, complete with fraud, condemnation and regulatory scrutiny. Sound familiar?  Even if safe, are they preferable?  My colleague Austin Campbell has a helpful blog about different types of stablecoins and their potential impact. Mark Hays is right that stablecoins need to be regulated. But he’s dead wrong about their utility. Dollar stablecoins can be a powerful force for economic inclusion.  See also: Stablecoins Are Not New. So Why Are Regulators Attacking Paxos? – Austin Campbell  Like other critics, Hays is a westerner of means. That means he holds dollars and gets to use things like credit cards. This is not a luxury afforded to a substantial portion of the global population – people living in countries with high inflation and low access to banking.  See also:  Defenders of the status quo should spend a month living in Argentina, Egypt or Nigeria. If not convinced, they should take a walk through countless poor and immigrant communities in the U.S. where pseudo-financial services like check cashers dominate.  If still not convinced, they should try sending large international wire on Saturday morning. God help them!  Congress will come around too  Dollar stablecoins aren’t just great for users, they are also great for the U.S. government because they increase demand for government debt at a time of high inflation and high deficits. Products like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC have already created over $100 billion in new demand for U.S. Treasurys, demand that’s much needed given the risk of de-dollarization.  This makes a properly designed and regulated one the ultimate win-win. Great for the oppressed abroad and the U.S government at home.

42411208,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCa8,1676393899,Why Bitcoin Miners Need to Take Ethereum Seriously,"Maximalist dogma does no one any good.  While much has been written about Bitcoin maximalism’s impact as a cultural force (and its inevitable decline), less has been said about how the ideology drives financial markets – including its influence on deployment decisions for institutional capital. This is worth examining because digital asset allocations may now be poised for a revolutionary shift towards the Ethereum blockchain.  Bitcoin (BTC) miners, in particular, may face a new opportunity as Ethereum’s potential value is unlocked. This opportunity may help offset and reverse the pressured margins that have dominated the sector starting in 2022, and may continue for some time.  Sam Tabar is chief strategist for Bit Digital, a bitcoin mining company listed on Nasdaq (BTBT).  Next year, the number of bitcoins that can be mined per block will drop from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125, making it harder for miners to turn a profit – unless, of course, the BTC price rises and/or network competition declines enough to compensate. Some believe this is exactly what will transpire, and much has been written on the Bitcoin blockchain’s supply/demand mechanism and its impact on mining economics. But from a simplistic, point-in-time perspective, at the exact moment of halvening, miner revenue will be instantly cut in half (assuming all else remains equal, admittedly a big assumption).  Ethereum, at first glance, may seem like an unlikely contender to add value to bitcoin miners. The network’s recent transition to a “proof-of-stake” (PoS) model eliminates the role of mining altogether. However, a PoS model for consensus allows Ethereum validators to receive passive ether (ETH) rewards, something currently not possible with Bitcoin. The mining sector is sitting on massive bitcoin reserves that have limited use as a financial instrument, outside of converting to cash to cover operations, and holding for the long term as bitcoin’s value recovers.  Ethereum’s network and its possibilities, by contrast, are always changing. Ethereum developers have fueled a proliferation of use cases, including the rise of decentralized exchanges (DEX), stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFT). Ethereum’s successful transition to PoS (aka “the Merge” in September 2022) marked a major milestone in the history of blockchain. Looking ahead, the network will undergo several new upgrades, including the Shanghai upgrade in March and sharding thereafter (both are expected to ease network congestion and establish the prerequisite for major adoption). The future of Ethereum is more exciting than ever, and the growth of layer 2 systems (i.e., Polygon, ZK rollups, Optimism and Arbitrum, to name a few) will further enhance Ethereum’s scalability.  Read more: Austin Campbell - Stablecoins Are Not New. So Why Are Regulators Attacking Paxos?  Despite criticisms of blockchain from certain environmental groups, Ethereum has become increasingly environmentally friendly. Post-Merge, Ethereum’s energy consumption decreased by an estimated 99.95%, and worldwide electricity consumption will be decreased by 0.2%, according to co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Coupled with a prior upgrade, EIP-1559, the Merge dramatically reduced the net issuance of ETH, and many believe ETH supply will be deflationary in the long term. A total of 2.8 million ETH representing $8.8 billion has been burned since the implementation of EIP-1599 in August 2021, increasing the scarcity of ETH, which would also suggest its long-term value.  A PoS blockchain like Ethereum can serve as a welcome complement to bitcoin mining operations. Bitcoin rewards can be converted to ETH, and then staked for rewards. Staked ETH can function like an interest-bearing asset, with balances compounding over time. This creates a flywheel-like effect between the two largest digital assets. From there, miners can devise additional creative ways to derive value. What might initially serve as a treasury management tool could, through innovation and development, become an additional line of business.  Ethereum and Bitcoin both have unique advantages and limitations. Bitcoin is the original proof-of-concept for decentralization, and has proven resilient even amid extreme market conditions that have tested it as a store of value. On the other hand, Ethereum is relatively versatile and encourages innovation. Iterations are being made to Ethereum continuously to extend its functionality and fix its imperfections for its vision of “a digital future on a global scale.” In the future, we expect Bitcoin and Ethereum to both serve integral roles in the global financial system and society at large.  Both concepts, proof-of-work (PoW) and PoS, can work in tandem. Bitcoin miners are in a unique position to realize how the two can complement one another to drive revenue, monetize stranded energy and realize the future of decentralization.

42414447,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB6lEF,1676391915,Siemens Issues Blockchain Based Euro-Denominated Bond on Polygon Blockchain,"Siemens (SIE), Germany’s third-largest publicly traded company by market cap, issued its first digital bond as it looks to reduce paperwork and reach out to potential purchasers directly.  The 60 million euro ($64 million) bond, issued on the Polygon blockchain, has a maturity of one year, according to a press release. The company declined to give the interest rate.  A blockchain bond “makes paper-based global certificates and central clearing unnecessary,” the company said in the statement. “What’s more, the bond can be sold directly to investors without needing a bank to function as an intermediary.”  The sale isn’t Siemens’ first experiment with blockchain technology. In December 2021, JPMorgan Chase partnered with the engineering and manufacturing giant to develop a blockchain-based system for payments. The system is used to automatically transfer money between the Munich-based company’s own accounts.  The Electronic Securities Act that allows the sale of blockchain-based debt to take place came into force in June 2021. Other German companies that have issued digital bonds on blockchain technology can be seen here.  “By moving away from paper and toward public blockchains for issuing securities, we can execute transactions significantly faster and more efficiently than when issuing bonds in the past,” said Peter Rathgeb, corporate treasurer at Siemens.

42411206,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMCTW,1676390405,Stablecoins Are Not New. So Why Are Regulators Attacking Paxos?,"What is a stablecoin? A common answer would be that a stablecoin is an instrument that attempts to maintain a steady value by either arbitrage or explicit backing represented on a private or public ledger.  Stablecoins are thought of as new technology, but looking closely at this definition reveals there are already over $22.8 trillion of U.S. dollar stablecoins in the world, primarily composed of $17.9 trillion of bank deposits and $4.8 trillion of money market funds. Also, there’s the $125 billion worth of stablecoins on blockchains.  Jesse Austin Campbell is an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and the former head of portfolio management at Paxos.  This is likely a surprising statement for both crypto natives and traditional financial people, but here is the simple reality: Stablecoins aren’t new, except for the bit about being on a blockchain. Fiat-backed stablecoins share the exact same underlying structure as many traditional financial instruments, and the only novel part is putting them on a slightly different technological ledger.  So what’s different about a stablecoin? It’s on a public ledger that’s open 24/7 instead of Wells Fargo’s internal books or a share held at DTCC [Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, a centralized clearinghouse]. What else? Not much.  Money market funds are investment funds with the primary goal of principal protection and a stable $1 price, while still paying yield to investors. Bank deposits are deposits held at a bank, which reloans that capital and pays a paltry yield to savers.  In the United States, we have well-defined regulatory frameworks for these kinds of things. For banks we have charters, capital requirements, risk weights and operational controls that need to be in place for all of our depository institutions. For money market funds, stable value funds and many similar types of insurance products we have specific requirements about holdings, liquidity and structure in place to protect consumers.  Yet, how many regulators have been willing to engage with or approve a product on a blockchain built to maintain a steady $1 NAV [net asset value] in the United States? Arguably one, if you count the efforts of the New York Department of Financial Services {NYDFS).  See also: Paxos 'Categorically Disagrees' With SEC That BUSD Is a Security  Even in that case, New York financial regulators have allowed only very limited deployment of stablecoins on the Ethereum chain (primarily GUSD, BUSD and USDP, the latter two of which I helped manage while at Paxos), with reserve and management guidelines significantly more conservative than the average government money market fund.  If the NYDFS licensed stablecoins were standalone banks, they would be far and away the safest bank in the United States!  Equal footing  Yet, we don’t allow stablecoin issuers full access to the banking system, for reasons that have never been clearly articulated. We’ve never had a fully functional regulated stablecoin in the United States that stands on equal footing with other financial instruments.  The difficult parts of issuing fiat-backed stablecoins are often misunderstood. The biggest problem is that crypto is a 24/7 system, while the banking system is a relic of antiquity that functions approximately 25% of the hours of the week (less when there are holidays). Matching liquidity between these systems so that the creation and destruction (or the minting and burning) of stablecoins can be instantaneous around the clock is a difficult problem. But it’s not difficult because of crypto. It’s difficult because the legacy system is hilariously outdated.  Stablecoins are arguably on better rails and are less risky than traditional mutual funds. Their reserves, the assets kept to back the stablecoin, are rarely leveraged out and consist of safer backing instruments than any bank in the United States.  Yet, we are now told stablecoins are too risky to be allowed to exist. If this is true and stablecoins are a dangerous threat to the system, then prime money market funds are a forthcoming nuclear war and JPMorgan merely existing is the equivalent of the moon potentially crashing into the Earth.  Despite the fact that stablecoins are materially less risky in economic terms, federal regulators continue to attempt to force stablecoins offshore leaving U.S. consumers earning low rates of interest in their bank accounts despite banks reaping record profits.  See also: Can Banks Issue Stablecoins? | Senior Fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research Thomas Hogan  It’s clear regulators prefer interacting with banks because banks are centralized and easy to control. Reading between the lines, the real risk stablecoins pose is creating a system less amenable to government efforts of control. But technological progress is not going to stop.  Economic activity is simply going to move elsewhere in the world if we continue down this path. United States regulators believe they face a choice between allowing or banning stablecoins, but in reality they face a choice between allowing stablecoins onshore or having them be primarily offshore.  Already, the biggest winner of the current U.S. attack on crypto is likely Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer with a less-than-reputable past. Stablecoin tether (USDT) is growing again while Circle’s USDC and the Paxos-issued BUSD, both of which are more transparent, more regulated and safer for consumers, are shrinking.  Are stablecoins a risk to the system? Yes, but primarily because blocking the development of properly functioning stablecoins onshore is going to lead to the future rails of finance being laid down offshore, outside the reach of the United States, without the consumer protections that exist onshore and potentially not even using the U.S. dollar as the main unit of exchange.  The greatest risk to the U.S. financial system is not allowing stablecoins. It is banning them.",NEUTRAL,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Austin Campbell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/14/stablecoins-are-not-new-so-why-are-regulators-attacking-paxos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/605ce816629211e87ca1f2db875c5ab3843e4f3b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414442,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB6kni,1676390400,Polygon Sets March Date for zkEVM Mainnet Beta to Go Live,"Polygon, an Ethereum scaling project, picked March 27 as the date for its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) beta main network to go live.  In a blog post, Polygon did not specify what the beta network will include but shared that the team will be releasing more details leading up to the March date in the coming weeks, and that security of the network will be of highest priority.  Zero-knowledge (ZK) technology is seen by many as a major improvement for blockchains and cryptography, aimed at increasing the speed of transactions and reducing their cost.  ZkEVMs are a type of zero-knowldege (ZK) rollup, a scaling solution that processes transactions faster on a layer 2, then sends the transaction data back to the mainnet blockchain – in this case Ethereum. ZK rollups use “proofs'' to show that a transaction was not spoofed with by only sharing a snippet of information about that transaction.  In October, Polygon went live with its zkEVM testnet, which deploys the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for its ZK rollup, allowing Ethereum developers to move over their smart contracts from the main blockchain without having to reprogram them in a different language.  Since the testnet went live, over 75,000 ZK proofs have been generated and 5,000 smart contracts have been deployed, according to the blog post.  In an interview last week, co-founder of Polygon Mihailo Bjelic told CoinDesk the blockchain is also exploring ways in which it could bring ZK-technology to its main chain, the Polygon POS chain.  “Polygon zkEVM Mainnet is set to be the first fully EVM equivalent ZK rollup to reach mainnet, this represents a huge step towards scaling Ethereum and bringing Web3 to the masses,” Sandeep Nailwal, a co-founder of Polygon, said in an email to CoinDesk. “The countdown is on.”  The price of Polygon's native MATIC token is up 56% this year.

According to a Form 13G filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Citadel Securities is now the owner of roughly 1.73 million shares or a 5.5% stake in Silvergate, valued at $25 million based on Monday's closing price of $14.71.  A person familiar with Citadel Securities told CoinDesk that the filing is a result of the firm's options market making activities rather than a directional investment or stake in Silvergate. Citadel Securities makes markets in more than a million individual options at any time. For 13G filings, options positions are calculated based on long call positions, regardless of any offsetting short calls or puts, explained the person.  Meanwhile, trading firm Susquehanna also reported in a filing that it bought about 2.37 million shares, or a 7.5% stake, in Silvergate. The investment would be valued at about $35 million, based on Monday's closing price.  Alongside a modest rally in the price of bitcoin, Silvergate shares are higher by just over 5% on Tuesday at $15.53. Shares are down about 87% over the past year.  The moves come after BlackRock said it boosted stake in Silvergate last month.

The changes include upgrades to Web3 applications, a communication layer on-chain to provide real-time tech support for developers and users, and a way of unlocking new privacy use cases from a regulatory and compliance perspective.  ""Our overarching goals for 2023 are the EVM compatibility and mainnet launch of our new [layer 2] infrastructure, zkBNB, and BNB Greenfield, the blockchain-based Web3 infrastructure,” said Alvin Kan, BNB Chain's director of growth.  EVM, or Ethereum Virtual Machine, is the native processing system that allows developers to create smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. ZK refers to the zero-knowledge proof protocol used for data encryption.  BNB Chain, originally known as Binance Smart Chain, comprises BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain (BSC). Since it started in September 2020 it has processed more than 3 billion transactions from 200 million unique addresses.  As part of the 2023 road map, BNB Chain said it aims to more than triple the number of validators to 100 from 29. Validators will have greater on-chain governance so that they can influence the direction of the network and its rules.  The blockchain plans to increase its throughput from 140 million gas limit and 2,200 transactions per second (TPS) to 300 million gas limit and 5,000 TPS. The term gas limit refers to the maximum price a cryptocurrency user is willing to pay when sending a transaction or performing a smart contract function.  BNB Chain said it will add Optimistic rollups to support a wider variety of uses in the ecosystem. An Optimistic rollup is an approach to scaling that involves moving computation and state storage away from the blockchain and are designed to make transactions cheaper and faster.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | ZK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/14/bnb-chain-aims-to-double-transaction-speed-targets-zk-tooling-in-2023-roadmap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8efb2207ae93c415acf1d4a4aec7787d321bd77d-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Zhao also hit out at claims, reported by Bloomberg, that rival stablecoin issuer Circle had sounded the alarm with NYDFS over concerns that Binance did not have enough reserves to back up BUSD tokens.  “I don't really believe Circle would do that – I don't think a professional industry peer will want to do that to another industry peer,” he said. “It just hurts the overall industry as we're seeing now ...

42410855,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs2Of,1676383277,Bitcoin’s UTXOs Are Close to All-Time High; Here’s Why It Matters,"Activity on the Bitcoin network is hitting an all-time high because the market has been very receptive to the new collections minted via Ordinals, a type of non-fungible token (NFT) stored on Bitcoin.  There’s another metric that’s important, too: unspent transaction output (UTXO). And the UTXO count of bitcoin (BTC) is ticking upwards, set to challenge its all-time high of 84.6 million from November 2022 – when there was a flurry of on-chain activity as traders tried to escape the wreckage of FTX's collapse.  UTXO refers to the individual units of bitcoin, called satoshis, or sats, that are locked in transactions on the blockchain.  When a transaction occurs, bitcoins are sent from one address to another and the remaining amount is sent back to the sender in the form of a UTXO.  These UTXOs can then be used as inputs for future transactions, essentially proving that the sender has the necessary funds to make the payment.  Now, this spike in UTXO could be explained by an increase in small, retail, interactions with bitcoin. It also shows that more individuals – as opposed to whales or large investors – are currently active on chain.  ""It seems like the overall trading size of the bitcoins has decreased and investors are carefully watching how the market direction would turn out with the UTXO value bands with less than 0.01 BTC are the main reason for the significant increase in the UTXO counts,“ CryptoQuant contributing analyst Dan Lim wrote in a note to CoinDesk. “It's good progress as there are market participants tapping into the market.""  UTXOs have steadily appreciated over the last two years. They experienced a brief dip during the coldest depths of the 2022 FTX-induced, end-of-year crypto winter but resumed their climb as bitcoin rallied through January.  UTXOs also tells us that despite a new, large cohort of people interacting with bitcoin thanks to Ordinals, there’s also a large group of whales HODLing. As CoinDesk previously reported, the age of UTXOs older than five years has increased by 17% in the past six months.  “Overall, the growth of the Bitcoin UTXO counts is a good thing because more exposure of bitcoins can create mass adoption in the long run,"" Lim said.  But the question is, what does this mean for the price of bitcoin? On one hand, a collision between a large group of stalwart HODLers and a new, growing group of retail users is, in, theory, bullish for the price of bitcoin. Others, however, aren’t so sure.  Tony Ling, co-founder of data portal NFTGo, and a partner at Bizantine Capital doesn’t think the demand from Ordinals is high enough yet to drive up the price of bitcoin even though its causing an up-tick in activity on-chain.  “There’s no mature marketplace on the Bitcoin network, so I have doubts about the real conversion and purchase demand,” he told CoinDesk in a note.  According to Ling, bitcoin's recent price rise has been fueled by an influx of USDT into bitcoin, not by increased pressure on the Bitcoin network due to ordinals.  Ling is still bullish about the price of bitcoin and expects it to reach around $30,000-$35,000 – but any attempt at testing all-time highs is not going to be until the second half of 2024.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/14/bitcoins-utxos-are-close-to-an-all-time-high-heres-why-it-matters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2dfff586a94bbc3bc7a42a591464e08c6b94c2b-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The consumer price index (CPI) is expected dip to an annual rate of 5.5% in January after printing 5.7% the previous month. The continued easing of inflation could prove positive for risk assets as it lowers the need for the Federal Reserve to be as aggressive with monetary policy tightening. “Today's CPI print is crucially important to decide the extent of downside for crypto,” QCP Capital wrote in a morning note.  LQTY, the native token of censorship-resistant decentralized stablecoin lender Liquidity, surged Monday after the NYDFS ordered Paxos to stop minting BUSD. The token rose 45% to a six-month high of $1.07, registering its biggest single-day percentage gain in at least a year, per data from TradingView. The rally likely stemmed from the Paxos-BUSD drama that triggered fears of a regulatory crackdown on the broader centralized stablecoin ecosystem, with some wondering if Circle’s USDC might be next. If so, the case for decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoins like Liquity's LUSD becomes clearer.  It was rival stablecoin issuer Circle that sounded the alarm on Paxos, according to Bloomberg. Circle reportedly tipped off the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) in the fall of 2022, complaining that blockchain data revealed Binance did not have enough reserves to back up the BUSD tokens it had issued through Paxos. The revelation comes several days after CoinDesk initially reported that NYDFS was investigating Paxos.  Chart of the Day  Bank of America's latest survey of global fund managers shows the percentage of money managers expecting a global economic recession in the next 12 months has dropped to 24%, having peaked at 77% in November.  The sharp decline means managers may be less hesitant to allocate money to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, than at the end of 2022.

""It's literally insane that people were going to use G-sheets to run these monstrous portfolios.""  The expansion of its risk management services has also seen Elwood add 50 new employees to its team, which now numbers 165 across offices in the U.K., U.S., Jersey and Singapore.

Orb Labs will use the funding to launch its first products, expand its team and to perform security audits. Other investors in the round included Shima Capital, 6th Man Ventures, Aves Lair, Newman Capital, Modular Capital and SevenX Ventures.  Blockchain interoperability allows developers to create products and services that utilize the benefits of multiple blockchains at the same time. Existing systems include cross-chain bridges, an avenue with notoriously weak security. Of the $3.1 billion that hackers took from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols last year, 64% was tied to cross-chain bridge exploits, according to a recent Chainalysis report. Orb Labs says its products offer a less expensive, faster and more secure alternative to the existing protocols.  ""Currently, developers are unable to find messaging protocols that push the limits on usability and security,” said Orb Labs co-founder Richard Adjei. “Our team is excited to power the next wave of blockchain interoperability by providing gas-efficient, fast, and trust minimized messaging protocols.”  Founded in 2022 by Princeton University classmates Adjei and Felix Madutsa, New York-based Orb Labs has created a cross-chain messaging protocol called Earlybird that allows developers to choose a security model that works best for their application based on the cost and speed needs. The startup is also working on MagicLane, a token and messaging platform built on top of Earlybird.  Lead backer Bain Capital launched its first crypto fund last March with $560 million in committed capital. The fund focuses on startups operating in the DeFi and Web3 spaces.

42414455,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB6luh,1676377793,"Investors Rush to Tether as Paxos' BUSD Faces Regulatory Heat, Curve Liquidity Pools Show","If you have been following crypto commentators on Twitter since Sunday you have probably read that U.S. financial regulators' recent action against Paxos' centralized, dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD is set to drive investors toward decentralized, censorship-resistant alternatives.  And while that seems logical, the evidence so far points to the opposite. Investors appear to be moving out of BUSD and its peers, USDC and DAI, and into tether (USDT), the world's largest centralized stablecoin, which has a market capitalization of $68.47 billion.  At press time, BUSD accounted for 81% of the total liquidity of $12.81 million in the busdv2 liquidity pool on the decentralized exchange Curve, while the pool's other components – DAI, USDC and USDT – accounted for the rest.  BUSD's dominance has increased from 69% since early Monday. In comparison, tether's presence has declined to 3%, the lowest in the pool, according to data sourced from analytics tool Chaineye and Curve, indicating an increased preference for USDT over BUSD and other centralized stablecoins in the wake of the regulatory action.  ""Investors are fleeing BUSD, even though Paxos gave all assurance that its issuance program is fully backed and will be wound down orderly,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at London-based Marex Solutions, told CoinDesk.  Early Sunday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) told Paxos it intends to sue the company for violating investor protection laws. Furthermore, the New York Department of Financial Services on Monday ordered Paxos to stop minting new tokens. In response, Paxos said it would cease issuing new tokens, and would process redemptions until at least 2024.  While the regulatory action has been BUSD-specific, market participants expressed concern that Circle's USDC could be next to face the heat, as evident from Twitter comments and from the imbalance in Curve's 3pool comprising USDT, USDC and DAI.  Tether's percentage share in the 3pool has dropped to 17.5% from 24% in two days, reaching a level last seen before Terra's collapse in May 2022. In contrast, USDC's share has increased to 41% from 38%. DAI's share has risen slightly to 40%, data from Dune Analytics show.  ""Curve's 3pool, in theory, should be three equal parts of DAI-USDC-USDT. But the pool has become wildly unbalanced as investors dumped USDC and DAI for USDT,"" Solot said.  The move toward tether might be a surprise because the biggest centralized stablecoin is, perhaps, the most controversial, considering it is unregulated and the lingering lack of transparency about its reserves. On Friday, a New York judge rejected an attempt by iFinex, cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and stablecoin issuer Tether, to block CoinDesk's request for information about the financial reserves backing the USDT token.  The fact that tether successfully navigated the Terra-induced turmoil of May 2021 may have boosted investor confidence in the stablecoin. Either that or it's a case of dwindling alternatives.  ""It's not exactly that trust increased, but the perception that the range of available alternatives is narrowing,"" Solot said. ""For example, Binance will probably have to backtrack on it's goal to establish BUSDC as the main base for trading in the exchange. Now it's likely that USDT will remain the primary base.""",NEGATIVE,USDT | DAI | USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | USDT | DAI | USDC,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/14/investors-rush-to-tether-as-paxos-busd-faces-regulatory-heat-curve-liquidity-pools-show,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9cb96bc956df467f65c43e419cfd430461df9b3-1920x1272.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These tokens were worth over $75 million when voting on the proposal ended. VOLT has a market capitalization of $107 million as of Tuesday.  The project also plans to expand to the Polygon network in a bid to acquire new users. Initially a meme coin themed after wolves, Volt Inu offers to users a decentralized exchange and a dragon-themed non-fungible token (NFT) collection.  The VOLT token was launched on the Ethereum blockchain and allocated 100% of its supply to Uniswap liquidity. In January 2022 it was also launched on the BNB Chain, then known as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), to gain more users as the blockchain was fairly popular among new crypto traders at the time.  Developers said burning tokens on the liquidity bridge is a security measure to protect against bridge attacks while improving token value for holders.  “In view of the events and hacks that cross-chain bridges have experienced in recent months (especially in 2022), we have nevertheless deemed it appropriate to try to reduce the impact of such attacks by reducing the liquidity (amount of tokens) locked in the bridge contract,” developers wrote in the proposal.  Bridges are blockchain-based tools that allow users to transfer tokens between different blockchains. However, these have been very susceptible to attacks: Last year alone saw over $2 billion lost or stolen from cross-chain bridges, as CoinDesk previously reported.  Developers said that while the liquidity locked in the bridge contract will be reduced by burning 44.85 trillion VOLT, some of the liquidity will the bridge will be important for arbitrage and meeting the liquidity demands of exchanges.  “The burn will have a short-term impact and also generate long-term deflationary impact by increasing reflections accumulated by burn addresses,” the proposal further explained.  A similar burn was earlier conducted by Floki DAO, a Shiba Inu-themed crypto project, earlier in February, as CoinDesk reported.

The Monad blockchain will launch on a testnet in the coming months, with the mainnet deployment planned for later this year, according to a statement. The blockchain will employ the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and will be Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible. As such, projects on Monad will be able to interact with the EVM software platform, where developers from many other blockchain projects also create interoperable decentralized applications on the Ethereum network.  ""The Monad blockchain will set the industry standards for the speed, transparency, security and scalability that all Layer 1 protocols should have,"" said Keone Hon, co-founder and CEO of Monad Lab, in the statement.  The funding round for Monad was led by crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital with the participation of 70 other investors, including Placeholder Capital, Lemniscap, Shima Capital, Finality Capital, as well as angel investors in the digital asset space including Naval Ravikant, Cobie, and Hasu, the statement said.  Redesigned blockchain  Over the few years, builders in the space have often been held back by high-cost and low reward on many layer 1 blockchains. This, in turn, affects innovation and mass adoption of the decentralized applications (dapps) by the developers.  Monad plans to address these issues through its new layer 1 protocol, which it claims will be able to process a total of 10,000 transactions per second. To do so, Monad made some key changes to the consensus and execution layers – two major mechanisms of a blockchain.  ""We redesigned the EVM execution system from the ground up to allow non-overlapping transactions to be run in parallel,"" said Eunice Giarta, co-founder and chief operating officer of Monad Labs. The team also remodeled the integration system between the two mechanisms to allow the blockchain’s execution layer to run in parallel to consensus, she noted.  ""Together, these improvements massively improve the system throughput, allowing the system to scale to many more users and applications,"" Giarta added.  Ethereum, the original smart contract blockchain, still holds the majority of the market share among layer 1 projects. However, there have been several new blockchains – dubbed “Ethereum Killers” – that are looking to improve Ethereum's processing time, fees and scalability. Some of the more popular layer 1 blockchains include Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Algorand and Internet Computer.  As more traditional financial entities enter the space, focus is turning increasingly into scalability and speed of blockchains. Monad’s team is seeking to capture this opportunity to build an improved version of a layer 1 blockchain.  “With a founding team that originated from Jump, Monad Labs understands the need for speed,” said Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder Capital, in the statement. “The [Monad] team is in the midst of parallelizing the EVM, creating a blockchain network and EVM-environment that rivals the performance of traditional tech and finance,” he added.

42414449,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB6lOr,1676373497,Morgan Stanley: Falling Stablecoin Issuance Is Negative Sign for Crypto Trading,"Stablecoins play a vital role in crypto trading and their products potentially compete with the fiat banking system, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a research report Monday.  The bank notes that U.S. regulators have begun limiting stablecoin products, adding that stablecoin issuance is important for crypto traders. Falling stablecoin market capitalization is an indication of falling cryptocurrency liquidity and leverage, the equivalent of quantitative tightening for the crypto market, the report said. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold.  Morgan Stanley notes that stablecoin market capitalization started falling at around the same time as the Federal Reserve balance sheet.  In the crypto bull market of 2021, bitcoin’s (BTC) price led the growth in stablecoin market capitalization, while during the bear market of 2022 the opposite occurred, the note said.  “Rising market prices enticed traders to take on more leverage, in the form of borrowing stablecoins, which was then used to buy more crypto,” analysts Sheena Shah and Kinji Steimetz wrote. “Falling market prices were catalyzed by a reduction in crypto liquidity caused by traders closing long crypto positions, followed by redemptions of the stablecoin received.”  The bank expects U.S. crypto regulatory efforts to focus on stablecoin regulation, and says issuers will probably have to register and prove they hold enough liquid assets to back the issued stablecoins.  “All stablecoins rely on market trust in the system’s ability to keep a stable value,” the note added.

The Geneva, Switzerland-based firm plans to use the funds to make new hires and expand across Europe and the United Arab Emirates, according to an announcement on Tuesday. Taurus declined to provide a valuation for the company.  Taurus says it works with more than 25 financial institutions, including Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, as well as Arab Bank Switzerland and Pictet Group, which also joined the funding round. Taurus offers custody, tokenization and trading of digital assets, including support for staking and decentralized finance (DeFi).  The funding round is a reminder that capital is still finding its way to the digital asset industry from major financial institutions, even after last year's crypto market crash and the collapse of crypto lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital as well as crypto exchange FTX.

Coinmetro purchased 71% of Ignium’s shares as of Feb. 3 and plans to buy the remaining stake by the end of April, statement said. The acquisition’s value is 4 million euros (US$4.3 million), Coinmetro said.  Based in Estonia, Coinmetro is a digital asset exchange licensed in the European Union and registered in Australia, Canada, and the U.S. Ignium offers a platform for micro and small enterprises to raise funds from their communities by minting non-fungible tokens (NFT) and issuing securities.  With the acquisition, Coinmetro said it intends to broaden its services to regulated securities offerings. This comes at a time when U.S. regulators are cracking down on exchanges such as Kraken and Paxos for offering products the regulators claim to be unregistered securities.  Coinmetro estimated there are some 60 million small enterprises that are unbanked because traditional financial services are unable to cater to their needs. The exchange plans to craft a product that helps these underserved businesses gain access to funding directly from their communities.  “This offering is the first of its kind in the crypto market, enabling participants in the crypto community to become even more engaged with the businesses they are most loyal to,” Coinmetro said.  The two firms already had an established relationship because Coinmetro was one of Ignium’s first customers and raised $2.5 million using the platform in 2021, Coinmetro said in a press release.

42414462,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB6zmL,1676366031,"Avalanche Blockchain Had 1,500% Transactional Growth in 2022: Nansen","Transactions on the Avalanche blockchain grew as much as 1,500% last year compared to 2021 even as the broader industry saw the collapse of several centralized crypto players and entered a technical bear market.  In Avalanche's fourth-quarter report shared with CoinDesk, data and analytics firm Nansen said the network demonstrated strength with notable increases in both non-fungible trading (NFT) trading volume and the overall number of transactions.  “While the network ended November 21, 2021, with nearly 27 million transactions, Avalanche’s cumulative total surpassed 450 million transactions on November 21, 2022, marking an astounding 1,507% increase in a single year,” Nansen said.  Such transactional activity came even as the total value of tokens locked on Avalanche-based decentralized finance applications slid from 2021’s $15 billion peak to just over $900 million in November 2022, data from DeFiLlama shows.  “Avalanche users may find themselves asking, ‘What crypto winter?’ as the network made impressive gains in Q4 2022,” said Mega Septiandara, research analyst at Nansen.  “With strong transaction totals and NFT trading volumes pairing well with new features and products set to improve user experience, Avalanche is poised for continued growth in 2023 as the entire Web3 space works to rebound from havoc caused by the FTX collapse,” Septiandara added.  When looking specifically at Avalanche’s C-Chain, the report noted that the Q4 daily transactions were mostly volatile, ranging between approximately 100,000 to 230,000 transactions per day.  Part of that growth may have come from Avalanche subnets, a custom blockchain built on Avalanche with products such as DeFi Kingdom’s DFK Subnet reaching a cumulative 200 million transactions on Nov 13, 2022.  Compared to Ethereum, however, the report noted Avalanche C-Chain’s transactions were relatively stable.  The Avalanche C-Chain, short for contract chain, is the default smart contract blockchain on Avalanche, which enables the creation of any Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. This operates complementary to the X-Chain, which is used to send and receive funds in the form of AVAX tokens.  Elsewhere, Avalanche saw a thriving non-fungible token marketplace throughout Q4, with the likes of industry-leading marketplace OpenSea’s expanding to the network.  In addition to substantial growth in overall transactions and NFT trading volumes, key developments that Avalanche saw during Q4 included several new projects, protocols, and features joining its ecosystem.  Notable projects include Core Web, a free, all-in-one command center giving users a more intuitive and comprehensive way to view and use Web3 across Avalanche and Ethereum, and JoePegs, an NFT marketplace launched in May that has grown to be the largest on Avalanche with over $3.4 million in secondary NFT sales and more than 12,000 users, Nansen noted.",POSITIVE,AVAX,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | RESEARCH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/14/avalanche-blockchain-saw-1500-transactional-growth-in-2022-nansen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e548c3b4afdce6d3f8de3a6b740f1e3ad2534b5-1695x785.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After learning he had used the privacy tool twice over recent weeks, “the Government promptly informed defense counsel and raised concerns about the defendant’s use of a VPN,” said a letter from the U.S. attorney Danielle Sassoon to Judge Lewis Kaplan, dated Feb. 13.  VPNs allow internet users to mask their whereabouts, which means the government can’t see what websites or data they access. Though they can be used benignly, they can also be used to access foreign crypto sites that block U.S. users and covertly access the dark web, Sassoon's letter said.  In a response dated Feb. 14, Bankman-Fried’s attorney Mark Cohen said he had the VPN to watch playoffs in the National Football League (NFL), and the Super Bowl, via an international subscription. Cohen said he's willing to allow a “reasonable” bail condition on VPNs, and that Bankman-Fried won't use one in the interim.  The court has already restricted Bankman-Fried's ability to contact FTX employees using ephemeral messaging services like Signal.

42414473,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB70IB,1676362244,Stablecoin Lender Liquity's LQTY Token Surges 45% as New York Regulator Goes After Paxos' BUSD,"LQTY, the native token of censorship-resistant decentralized stablecoin lender Liquity, surged Monday after a New York regulator ordered Paxos to stop minting its centralized dollar-pegged cryptocurrency BUSD.  The LQTY token rose 45% to a six-month high of $1.07, registering its biggest single-day percentage gain in at least a year, per data sourced from the charting platform TradingView.  The rally likely stemmed from the Paxos-BUSD drama that triggered fears of a regulatory crackdown on the broader centralized stablecoin ecosystem, including Circle's USDC, and underscored the need for decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoins like Liquity's LUSD.  ""BUSD proves the need for decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoins. This is indeed the mission of Maker and Liquity's LUSD. Maker's Endgame Plan foresees a regulatory crackdown on crypto and [real-world assets], so it's preparing to make DAI censorship resistant. The same mission drives LUSD stablecoin, but its approach is focused on minimal governance and ETH as the only collateral,"" pseudonymous DeFi researcher Ignas told CoinDesk.  Liquity is an Ethereum-based protocol offering interest-free loans against a minimum of 110% collateral in ether (ETH). The loans are paid out in the form of a dollar-pegged stablecoin LUSD and borrowers only need to pay a small loan generation free. The redemption and loan issuance fees are adjusted algorithmically. The LQTY is a reward token created by the protocol to incentivize users, frontends and stability providers – the first line of defense in maintaining system solvency.  The protocol runs a two-token model like MakerDAO. The difference, however, is that Liquity doesn't have a governance system. Therefore, large holders of LQTY cannot influence decision-making. The fully-decentralized setup also means the protocol's original design cannot be altered to introduce centralized stablecoins, which have recently come under regulatory scrutiny, as new collateral.  More importantly, Liquity doesn't run its own web interface, and its smart contracts can be accessed via multiple third-party front ends. ""As a company, Liquity AG is not running its own front end – making the system more decentralized and censorship-resistant. To open loans, make deposits etc., users thus have to use one of the frontends provided by third parties,"" the official website says.  These features make Liquity's LUSD censorship-resistant and provide the protocol an edge over MakerDAO. Hence, its no surprise that some traders consider LQTY and not MakerDAO's MKR token as a refuge against the regulatory crackdown.  ""LUSD backed by ETH collateral is being perceived as more defensible against regulatory pressure by the market,"" Lewis Harland, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, said.  The renewed bias for decentralized crypto-backed stablecoins is evidence of fasting changing narratives in the crypto market. These coins had fallen out of favor in May last year following the dramatic collapse of Terra's algorithmic decentralized stablecoin UST.  While LQTY surged over 40% on Monday, MKR rose 12% and Tron's TRX rose 3%. Tron, a smart contract platform supposedly maintaining true decentralization and censorship resistance, unveiled a decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoin USDD last year.  Crypto Twitter is optimistic that Liquity and other protocols offering decentralized stablecoins will continue to shine if the regulatory crackdown on centralized dollar-pegged coins intensifies.  ""I see no reason why $LUSD won’t return to a +1B market cap again, especially with Gensler acting like a child with a handgun. $LQTY is my favorite mid-term play,"" one DeFi investor tweeted.",POSITIVE,ETH | MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MKR,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/14/interest-free-stablecoin-lender-liquitys-lqty-token-surges-45-as-regulators-go-after-paxos-busd,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e76a0dc3c560163dd3e035acee6c12abd7ac7af-3157x1468.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While Curve does not offer native stablecoins yet, its upcoming curve USD (crvUSD) token is much awaited in crypto circles. Curve’s plans to deploy a dollar-pegged asset first became public in June, as CoinDesk reported.  Curve seemed to tease the upcoming issuance of crvUSD on Monday, stating an ongoing proposal would be “required for crvUSD to function autonomously.” The ongoing proposal would allow stablecoin pools to supply pricing data to external protocols.  Such a development likely served as a catalyst for traders as demand for CRV gained and the tokens saw over $770 million in trading volume on crypto exchanges.  Curve relies on smart contracts instead of middlemen to offer financial services such as stablecoin borrowing, trading and lending to users. Depositors on Curve earn annual yields of up to 4% from one of the many pools on the platform.  It is one of the most popular and influential protocols among the crypto community and locks up $4.6 billion worth of tokens.  CRV traded over $1 on Tuesday, reaching early-January levels and bucking an overall market decline as bitcoin (BTC) lost 1%. The move came as tokens related to decentralized stablecoins became the latest driver of crypto markets.  As per a Wall Street Journal report on Sunday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Sunday alleged that BUSD is unregistered security. The news came days after CoinDesk previously reported Paxos is under investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services, though the scope of NYDFS' investigation is unclear.  This caused bearish sentiment for centralized stablecoins such as BUSD, with traders likely looking for decentralized counterparts which will be less likely to face legal consequences in the future.  Decentralized stablecoins rely on a basket of cryptocurrencies to back their peg to a fiat currency, mostly U.S. dollars. They can either be algorithmic – wherein another token is issued and continually minted or burned to help maintain the stablecoin’s peg – or overcollateralized – where the basket of assets are far in excess to back a stablecoin’s net circulation.  “The crvUSD could be a very interesting development, as we haven’t yet seen a stablecoin that is issued by a major DEX,” (decentralized exchange) Daniel Zlotin, senior decentralized finance (DeFi) developer at Orbs, wrote in a Telegram message to CoinDesk explaining crvUSD’s utility.  “Connecting a stablecoin with a viable [decentralized finance] platform could open up some interesting possibilities in terms of new models (such as using LP tokens as part of the backing system),” Zlotin added, cautioning that there would “definitely be some challenges” in implementing such a concept.",POSITIVE,BTC | CRV,BTC | CRV | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/14/curve-token-surges-over-10-as-crypto-traders-eye-curve-usd-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e21a591142511d9d4e4446ce48c2ecb1c0e4254-3333x2500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414463,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB6zwx,1676353316,Blockchain Association Files Amicus Brief in Coinbase Insider Trading Case,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is attempting to create a “chilling effect” on the blockchain industry by labeling nine tokens at the center of an insider trading case as securities, but not giving the token creators a chance to defend themselves.  Last year, the SEC lodged a complaint against former Coinbase manager Ishan Wahi for tipping off his brother and close friend regarding new listings of tokens on Coinbase. Earlier this month, Wahi pleaded guilty to insider trading charges, changing his plea from not guilty. Wahi is still contesting the securities fraud charges.  The tokens in question include AMP, XYO, LCX, POWR, RLY, RGT, DDX, DFX, and KROM. Data from CoinGecko indicates that these tokens trade in relatively thin volume, and don’t rank within the top 150 tokens the service tracks.  In court, Wahi’s lawyers have argued that these tokens are not securities, and therefore he cannot be charged for securities fraud.  The Blockchain Association, a Washington-based crypto lobbying organization, is seeking to advance that argument by saying that the SEC is engaging in “absentee enforcement” as the token creators are not linked to the case, nor, by statute, can they intervene or be otherwise heard.  “Such behavior is improper for a government agency, and is irreconcilable with due process concerns,” the docket reads. “The SEC’s motive, then, is merely to backdoor a precedent that can be used in other cases, as, indeed, it is already doing in other cases where the DOJ has brought an action, and the SEC has piled on with similar allegations of securities laws violations against absent third parties.”  In late December, the SEC called FTX’s former exchange token FTT a security in a complaint against FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Neither Ellison nor Wang contested the complaint as part of a plea agreement.  “Rather than pursue proper rulemaking under the [Administrative Procedure Act] to address those issues, the SEC has instead issued a long history of inconsistent, incomplete, and confusing public statements, and has pursued a pattern of “regulation by enforcement,” the docket reads. “Now, the SEC extends its doctrine of ‘regulation by enforcement’ to ‘regulation by unchallengeable allegation’.  The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) is statute that outlines the procedures of administrative law, and how federal administrative agencies make rules and adjudicate.  The docket outlines in considerable detail, naming prior cases, how digital asset laws, and prior enforcement by the SEC, make the U.S. an opaque and confusing jurisdiction to do business in for the digital assets industry. All the while, there have been material changes to the tokens’ value because of the SEC’s actions.  “The SEC’s pronouncement that a particular token is a security has also already resulted in delisting from cryptocurrency trading platforms,” the docket reads, pointing to a delisting of one of the tokens by Binance.US out of an “abundance of caution.”  Wahi is due back in court on April 6. Wahi’s lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss the SEC’s complaint regarding securities fraud, by arguing the tokens in question are not securities, while still pleading guilty to insider trading and other charges.

""Just 15 months ago, we were searching for product-market fit on Solana,"" Lu wrote. ""Since then, our business has grown significantly and the nature of our challenges has evolved.

In response, it has expanded support for Ethereum and Polygon-based NFTs to help it stay competitive against marketplaces like OpenSea.

Regulators in the United States are closely eyeing crypto these days, and Binance’s BUSD stablecoin is their latest target. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to launch enforcement action against Paxos, the issuer of BUSD, as it deems the stablecoin a security. Paxos says that it will vigorously defend itself, and the issue is going to court.  Traders aren’t reacting well, with withdrawals from Binance surging, according to on-chain data from Nansen.  ""If this is a Binance issue, we see further kind of regulatory scrutiny being imposed by the SEC, you do have that headline risk, and I think that's certainly what's weighing on crypto markets,” Tastycrypto Head of Digital Assets Ryan Grace told CoinDesk TV.  But Grace added: ""I believe that the macro kind of economic backdrop is still the primary driver here. It's Fed policy. In addition to some of the SEC headlines, we have CPI again on Tuesday expected to come down a little bit. But you're starting to see in the markets a bit of a concern that not so much even a soft landing, but that the Fed isn't going to land here. The economy is gonna run hot, and ultimately you're going to see higher interest rates.""  Grace says it's possible for bitcoin to end the year above $25,000, but in the immediate future it’s still a difficult market.  “You’re gonna see a lot more volatility, a lot more chop before we get there,” he said.

Just as Asia got to work on Monday, the Wall Street Journal had a bombshell: The SEC was going after Binance-branded stablecoin BUSD.  Going after BUSD might seem like a strange tactic to some observers. While the stablecoin wears Binance’s branding, it's issued by Paxos and regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services. As opposed to Tether, which fought in court to keep what’s backing USDT a secret, BUSD is the right way to do a stablecoin.  Even as Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao tweeted that BUSD ""funds are Safu,"" the market reacted negatively to the report. Starting Asian morning hours on Monday, the BNB Chain's native BNB tokens fell 7% and BUSD saw some $52 million in inflows to exchanges – a sign of bearish sentiment, data firms such as CryptoQuant said.  Sources close to the matter say the whole thing came without warning. But that’s not good enough for the SEC.  The regulator has placed a curse on it – the Howey Test – a 1933 U.S. Supreme Court case that determined that if a transaction is found to be an investment contract, it’s considered a security.  To be sure, there is an argument – an ancient one in crypto years – that stablecoins are securities.  A June 2022 briefing paper prepared by the Congressional Research Service outlines how under the Reves test, which came from a 1990 case that examined when a note is a security, stablecoins may qualify as securities under Reves’ four-part test.  “Even so, some commentators have proposed theories to support the proposition that stablecoin purchasers may be motivated by profits for purposes of the Howey and Reves tests,” the CRS paper reads. “In brief, the arguments appeal to the role that stablecoins play in facilitating cryptocurrency speculation and the fact that some stablecoins have traded above par during crypto-market turmoil.”  CRS concludes that the issue remains “unsettled,” but cautions that the lack of clarity sets the stage for a trial.  And here we are today.  The problem is, while the U.S. engages in “regulation by enforcement,” Asia’s financial centers are developing clear-cut frameworks.  Hong Kong is developing its own stablecoin regime, which looks to give the green light to asset-backed stablecoins (provided the reserve assets are of “high quality and high liquidity” while meeting outstanding stablecoins in circulation) but gives a red light to algorithmic stablecoins.  Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is in the process of consultation with stablecoin issuers. One proposed route could see them being licensed under the city-state’s digital payment token service providers regime, which is regulated by the Payment Services Act 2019.  In an interview with CoinDesk during the Singapore Fintech Week, Ripple’s general counsel, Stu Alderoty, who’s currently leading Ripple’s fight against the SEC, said that all of this simply hurts the retail consumer in the U.S. that the SEC is supposed to protect.  “It has not provided clarity, and it's pushing innovation offshore to other economic centers like Singapore,” he said. “If the U.S. gets this wrong, they're going to lose their position as a leader in this new financial economy.”  Binance, in a statement to CoinDesk after the story broke, seemed to amplify Alderoty’s thoughts.  “Given the ongoing regulatory uncertainty in certain markets, we will be reviewing other projects in those jurisdictions to ensure our users are insulated from further undue harm,"" a spokesperson said.
