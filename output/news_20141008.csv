42426122,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIikxh,1412805605,Serbia's Bitcoin Community Pledges Response to Central Bank Warning,"The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) issued its first statements on bitcoin earlier this month, echoing familiar warnings issued by central banks around the global.  Citing statements from the European Banking Authority, the NBS confirmed that bitcoin is not considered legal tender under the country's laws, that banks and licensed exchange dealers are prohibited from transacting in bitcoin and that consumers who choose to use digital currency do so at their own risk.  While not the progressive action many in the central European nation had hoped for, members of the local bitcoin community told CoinDesk that they were pleased by the bank's official recognition of digital currency, describing it as the best possible outcome given the more reactionary actions observed around the world.  Aleksandar Matanovic, a Serbian resident and founder of digital currency exchange and bitcoin ATM operator Bitcoin 365, told CoinDesk:  ""The more modern and open-minded approach would have been a huge surprise, having in mind that Serbia is very slow with adopting innovations, especially in the field of finance.""  Though it won't likely have a lasting impact on the global regulatory conversation, the announcement could do much to encourage the local community to be more active in advocating for bitcoin and its potential benefits.  Serbia's economy has been adversely affected by years of political turmoil, and was most recently hampered by costly and damaging flooding this summer. Further, its payments ecosystem remains underdeveloped, with a PayPal delegation only visiting the market for the first time in April to discuss whether it would allow local residents to begin receiving money through its service.  Community readies for offensive  A local Bitcoin Foundation member, who wished to be identified only as ma∆∆a, described the local bitcoin community as appealing to ""geeks only"", but both he and Matanovic suggested that the central bank warning may galvanize the community to better advocate for bitcoin domestically.  Ma∆∆a cited the ongoing conversation surrounding New York's proposed BitLicense as a potential first step, as its regulations could potentially be applied in Serbia in the future.  With the central bank's statement issued, Matanovic indicated that Serbia's Ministry of Finance could be encouraged to learn more about the technology. Beginning this conversation with the financial regulator will be the focus of an advocacy group that he wishes to start.  ""A group of bitcoin enthusiasts are in the process of establishing a bitcoin association here,"" Matanovic said. ""We will give our best to promote bitcoin, raise the awareness and educate people about using it. One of the goals would be to try to talk with Ministry of Finance in attempt to regulate bitcoin, so businesses can start using it.""  Until there are more safeguards for local users, ma∆∆a said, bitcoin adoption is likely to remain low.  ""I have to agree with the noted in the warning, that bitcoin without the insurance is only for tech savvy people,"" he added.  Bitcoin ecosystem unaffected  Matanovic told CoinDesk that he doesn't believe the statement will have a measurable effect on the country's local bitcoin ecosystem. For now, he notes, buyers, investors, miners and traders are all free to continue their activities.  ""All those users have already been aware of the risks, so I really doubt this warning would change anything for them,"" he said.  However, Matanovic suggested that those who are unfamiliar with digital currency or its potential benefits may be turned away by the statements.  ""[The] majority of the people here like to have money in their hands, they don't even trust banks, especially not some 'virtual money schemes',"" he said, emphasizing a description used by the NBS.  Ma∆∆a suggested that bitcoin businesses will be affected the least, though this is because there are so few that operate locally. He said that there are currently no homegrown services or products for the country's bitcoin ecosystem, just some local exchange points and one restaurant, Appetite in Belgrade, which also hosts the bitcoin ATM operated by Bitcoin 365.  Matanovic indicated that his startup will be unaffected by the decision, as though its team works in Serbia, it doesn't intend to base its business operations there when it opens to the public in 2015.  High hopes for bitcoin  Matanovic suggested that Serbia could have a powerful incentive to adopt bitcoin payments, due to the fact that its financial infrastructure lags behind international offerings.  He told CoinDesk that traditional remittance offerings from MoneyGram and Western Union are only sparsely available, and that most locals don't use credit cards:  ""Things like PayPal or Skrill are almost not used here, so people would have no problem abandoning those things (since they have never adopted them), going directly to bitcoin and jumping over one evolutionary step (centralized online payment systems) of payment systems.""  Matanovic concluded by acknowledging the work the local community has ahead.  ""Besides government support, a lot of promotional and educational activity would be needed to encourage people to use it,"" he said. ""It's a tough task, but not impossible I hope.""

42426125,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIil9h,1412802023,"MintPal Exchange Relaunch Plagued by Technical Issues, User Complaints","MintPal’s long-awaited relaunch took place on Tuesday, but the kick-off was marred by systemic problems that left some users at least temporarily unable to access their accounts.  Purchased  by digital currency services provider Moolah in July, MintPal has delayed its platform upgrade several times. The most recent delay took place in late September, as Moolah was preparing to migrate from its old platform to its new one.  The latest version of the long-popular altcoin-focused exchange is now up and running, though some tools and resources including graphs remain unavailable for users.  Basic features work and users are able to process both deposits and withdrawals, but MintPal has had to scramble to address a number of user issues, including problems related to account access, two-factor authentication, market trading and coin balances.  The MintPal team has been active in addressing user issues, as shown by frequent updates on Twitter. Though some users have reported that they are unable to access their accounts, the company released an update several hours ago stating that they are moving to solve the missing account issue.    All missing accounts have imported, we are running a balance audit on these before making them live.      — Moolah (@moolah_io) October 8, 2014    CoinDesk reached out to Moolah for comment but did not receive a reply by press time.  MintPal’s rebirth bid  MintPal’s relaunch was intended to address a drop in trading volume months after roughly eight million vericoins were stolen from the exchange. The incident raised questions about security and ultimately led to its acquisition by Moolah.  When Moolah purchased MintPal in July, CEO Alex Green told CoinDesk that the deal happened because his company saw an opportunity to invest broadly in what was then one of the world’s most popular altcoin exchanges.  He said at the time:    “We believed that we were in the best position in terms of security, operational and performance expertise in order to take the exchange to the next level.”          In an effort to boost trading volume, MintPal has offered a number of incentives aimed at users with significant holdings – include the postponement of trading fees for the remainder of the year.  MintPal is also offering bonuses of 1.5 BTC for the first 10 traders that exceed 100 BTC in volume. In the first few hours of trading, several altcoin markets on MintPal exceeded 100 BTC in 24-hour volume, though it isn’t immediately clear if these volumes were the result of single users.  Community split  The social media buzz surrounding the MintPal relaunch grew louder in the days preceding the official kick-off.  In the preceding days, owner and operator Moolah teased the completion of data migration on Twitter. This prompted some users to question the competence of the company, though some expressed hope that they might see volumes like the 10,000 BTC or more that the exchange saw earlier this year.  Public expectations of the platform’s future seem to have been dampened by the circumstances of the launch. Some users expressed anger over long wait times, raising concerns that MintPal had become overwhelmed by the launch.  As one user said:    @moolah_io Can't log into my mintpal account. Sent you a support email, no reply yet. I have money on your exchange and it belongs to me. — Sean (@SeanJMacIsaac) October 8, 2014            The issues which appear to be persisting for some users has led to suggestions that MintPal was not ready for launch, and at least one altcoin developer has said publicly that it does not wish to have its coin listed on the exchange.    Like many I thought Mintpal V2 would be ""good"". So very wrong. @MintPalExchange you have no permission to list CoinmarketsCoin. $JBS      — Julian AKA The Truth (@jyap) October 7, 2014      One user posted that the MintPal user interface template had been purchased from digital media marketplace Envato.  The company commented on the Twitter thread that the ProUI template was originally intended to be temporary, stating:  “We are going to continue work on fixing the current issues, then focus on improving and refining wherever we can. Getting rid of the template designed for an internal prototype is a definite priority. First comes the account issues. We're in this for the long haul.”  Images via Shutterstock, MintPal",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/08/mintpal-exchange-relaunch-plagued-by-technical-issues-user-complaints,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b9fb0f5f14524dfa48c6825374bc649cd06bb9c-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426121,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIikzh,1412790243,Bitcoin Fails to Impress Bankers at Peruvian Startup Challenge,"Latin America is widely believed to one of the markets that could most benefit from digital currency, as the region's consumers and businesses have been afflicted by volatile government-backed currencies, capital controls and high remittance costs.  Given these challenges, a small but passionate local bitcoin industry has emerged in Latin America, with the aim of giving local consumers access to both an alternative currency and a modern payments technology. Further, market leaders such as Bitex.la and BitPagos are now expanding with assistance from large, international investors.  Despite its position of interest in the bitcoin space, bitcoin awareness remains low in some parts of the region, according to Roger Benites, the founder of Peru-based bitcoin startup BitInka. Benites said his belief has never been stronger than in the aftermath his company's entrance into Digital Bank Latam 2014, a startup incubator challenge in his home country.  The event, which took place on 23rd September, aimed to showcase exciting new ideas that could improve the domestic banking industry. BitInka entered the contest aiming to appeal to banks looking for solutions to fiat exchange restrictions in the region.  Despite the potential appeal of the idea, however, the audience at the event wasn't receptive to BitInka's pitch.  Benites told CoinDesk:  “Banks still frown upon bitcoin, and in a country like Peru where almost no bitcoin businesses exist, showcasing the product created a lot of questions. The [competition] placed BitInka as a bank, and [judges] did not understand how using bitcoin to collect funds would benefit them.”  While most contestants showcased platforms aimed at social media in marketing, BitInka was the only bitcoin company that entered, according to Benites.  Talking bitcoin to the banks  Speaking to CoinDesk, Benites voiced his pride at being able to compete at Digital Bank Latam, even though BitInka didn't exit with a top prize.  Contestants pitched their startups to the event organisers, who selected the finalists over a two-month review period. Benites surmised that judges were interested in seeing how one might affiliate bitcoin with a bank, but that by the final selection, they felt differently.  “It’s tough to talk bitcoin here in South America, especially to banks. They see it as a threat […] They saw it mostly as we were trying to build a bank,"" he said.  Startups were notified three weeks in advance of their one-shot presentation pitches, which were limited to seven minutes.  “All of the judges were CEOs of the major banks here in Peru and did not see the path we tried to explain on applying their product to our platform,” he said.  Emphasizing the context in which they showed, he said BitInka’s focus on how the platform can be useful for micropayments and remittances was eye-opening for many in the audience. The electric money law was only implemented in Peru last year, allowing banks to issue clients electronic money as a means of achieving greater financial inclusion.  A credit card payment platform called Culqui won. It is an app that uses a QR code to process credit cards, and a contestant from the incubator that sponsored the event, said Benites.  He added:  “We wanted to get into the competition to spread the word that we are coming to town. We are currently seeking investors and partners that we can use as payment processors, if there are any more contests where we can showcase the product we will compete in them.”  Bitcoin as a trading index  Benites described BitInka as a digital wallet merged with a bitcoin exchange. Users can send and receive bitcoin as well as fiat currencies. BitInka currently supports the US dollar, Argentine peso, Bolivian boliviano, Peruvian sol and Venezuelan bolivar.  “We're targeting the countries that have exchange restrictions […] where people could benefit from a platform like this one,” he said.  The company has local bank accounts in the countries in which it operates, as well as partnerships with money processors like DineroMail in Argentina and Alignet in Peru. To put fiat into the wallet, users can access their local deposit collection point.  Benites explained:  “Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Venezuela have laws on electronic money. We are using this as our advantage.”  Consumers who reside in Ecuador and Bolivia will be unable to buy bitcoin, but can send money to others using bitcoin as a trading index, or exchange rate – which Benites says will be stated clearly in its legal terms. He added that BitInka uses the term “trading index” instead of “exchange rate” because “bitcoin is not a legally declared coin, but it can be a good if two or more people choose to buy and sell it"".  BitInka is headquartered in Peru; it has a branch in Bolivia, and Argentina and Venezuela locations are forthcoming.  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

42426113,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIikjh,1412776179,Bitcoin Foundation Calls for Access to Research Behind BitLicense,"The Bitcoin Foundation has again commented on the 'BitLicense' proposal put forth by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to regulate bitcoin businesses in the state.  In a statement released today, the foundation highlights the need for public access to the ""extensive research and analysis"" cited by the NYDFS when the BitLicense was first proposed. This data, it says, is essential to examine the rationale used by the NYDFS in substantiating its regulatory proposal.  The foundation further points out that the NYDFS has failed to produce these materials. Despite an initial promise to publish by 20th October 2014, the NYDFS has since delayed the delivery of its research until December.  In comments at the time, the Bitcoin Foundation said it found the NYDFS decision ""disappointing"", pointing out that the process would be completed well after the NYDFS stops accepting comments from the public.  Impact on free speech  The foundation recognizes the need for good regulation, saying it could help grow the bitcoin ecosystem and thus bring benefits for New York consumers and businesses. However, it claims the NYDFS has not explained how the BitLicense will actually improve the environment for either bitcoin or New York's consumers.  Jim Harper, global policy counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, explained:  “The sacrifice of some decentralization in furtherance of other benefits to the bitcoin ecosystem must meet a high burden of proof. Nobody should want a regulation that sacrifices bitcoin’s benefits if doing so produces unknown or merely speculative benefits for New York consumers of the New York financial services marketplace.”  Specifically, the foundation expresses concerns about the proposal's ""technology-specific"" nature, as it would treat block chain-based companies as financial service providers even if that is not the case.  This could have a negative impact on communicative and expressive uses of bitcoin's public ledger, said Harper, adding that the proposed regulation as it stands would require ""unreasonable financial surveillance, which may violate the Fourth Amendment"".  Harper also took issue with the way the NYDFS has referenced digital currencies:  ""Bitcoin is a digital currency, and our preference is that it be called 'digital' as opposed to 'virtual'. The latter term should be reserved for currencies that inhabit closed commercial and game-playing systems.""  He added that the NYDFS is interested in bitcoin because of its ""very real"" potential rather than ""virtual potential"" for consumers and businesses.  ""Your regulatory proposal should refer to it as digital and real, not virtual,"" he concluded.  Appeal for moderation  Today's comments by the foundation also point out that various US government and legal bodies outside New York have worked to integrate bitcoin into the existing regulatory framework. These include the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Federal Election Commission (FEC) amongst others.  The foundation said this ""more modest"" approach offers a way to create a ""safe and sane"" environment that would allow bitcoin businesses to thrive.  Harper said:  “A regulatory regime that is markedly out of step with others is very likely to create inefficiency in national and global markets, which would suppress competition, hamper the delivery of benefits to consumers and frustrate consumers.""  Ending on a positive note, however, Harper described New York as ""a very special state"" and argued that it needs to take a ""methodical, iterative approach"" to bitcoin regulation.  Industry fears  Industry response to the BitLicense proposals has been mixed so far, with some companies seeing benefits in measured regulation and others expressing concerns over its reach and impact. Others, like Circle, have even gone so far as to say they would not serve the state if the regulations are brought in as they currently stand.  In a recent interview with CoinDesk, NYDFS superintendent Ben Lawsky explained some of the proposal's controversial delays, arguing that New York simply cannot afford to get bitcoin regulation wrong.  The NYDFS, he said, intends to establish nuanced and thoughtful rules that would not stifle innovation, ensuring a bright future for bitcoin businesses in New York.

42426117,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIikrh,1412761055,Coinplug's $2.5 Million Funding Round Reveals Bitcoin Growth in Korea,"South Korean bitcoin multi-services company Coinplug announced yesterday it has closed a Series A funding deal worth $2.5m from mainly local venture capitalists. The new investment brings the firm to a total of $3.3m raised so far.  This week's deal notably included bitcoin venture capitalist Tim Draper, but was led by Mirae Asset Venture Investment, an arm of Seoul-based financial industry giant Mirae Asset. The round also included major Korean VC firm Bokwang Investment Corp, Capstone Partners and DSC Investment.  Coinplug  had previously received two funding rounds worth $400,000 each in a combination of fiat currency and bitcoin, in November 2013 and April this year. Draper was also involved in April's round.  Coinplug's Richard Yun, himself one of the firm's initial investors, told CoinDesk it is notable that most of the round's funding comes from Korea itself:  ""Most investors are Korean VCs that are interested and recognized our technology and great potential for growth, so these are very meaningful investments.""  Youth focus  Coinplug would use the funding, Yun said, to develop a new services platform combining bitcoin and online content, expand Korea's bitcoin userbase, and install more of its locally developed bitcoin ATMs.  There have been growing requests for the ATMs from department stores, universities, and franchise stores, according to the firm.  Yun identified young people making purchases online as key prospects for digital currency growth in the country:  ""Teenagers do not have credit cards for online payments, such as recharging online game points and purchasing mobile and online game items, online shopping etc. So we will launch bitcoin prepaid cards that sell at national franchise convenience stores at the end of October.""  Bitcoin industry boom  There has been a significant increase in venture money flowing into Korea's bitcoin industry in recent months. Coinplug's rival Korbit secured a $3m round in August led by Softbank Ventures Korea, in addition to a previous $600,000 funding.  Both companies offer multiple bitcoin infrastructure services for consumers and merchants. Coinplug offers the chance to pay with bitcoin at over 10,000 online sellers, thanks to a July deal with payments company Galaxia Communications.  Coinplug has also developed a series of mobile apps for both iOS and Android consisting of a wallet, trading exchange and merchant point-of-sale software.  In addition to its business activities, Coinplug seeks to develop Korea's bitcoin ecosystem in other ways.  It has helped organized a bitcoin-specific session at the 15th World Knowledge Forum (Asia's largest business forum) and the KU Bitcoin Expo for students at Korea University. Both events will take place in Seoul about 10 days from now.

42426112,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIikfh,1412727951,Gavin Andresen Proposes Bitcoin Hard Fork to Address Network Scalability,"Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen has proposed increasing the number of transactions allowed on the bitcoin network by raising the maximum block size by 50% per year.  Doing so would require a hard fork and “some risk”, Andresen conceded in a new Bitcoin Foundation blog posthttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/10/a-scalability-roadmap/, but he concluded that such proposals are necessary for the long-term viability of bitcoin as a global payments system.  Entitled A Scalability Roadmap, the piece builds on Andresen's past statements regarding how he believes the bitcoin network can be scaled to handle more transactions. While the near-term need to do so may not seem apparent, Andresen wrote, an opportunity to address the bitcoin network’s scalability needs shouldn’t be missed.  Andresen suggested that the bitcoin development community’s consensus-driven decision-making process might result in an alternative solution or even multiple fixes to scalabiilty. Still, he argued that the limit on bitcoin transactions has been identified in the past as a weakness in need of addressing.  Andresen wrote:  “Agreeing on exactly how to accomplish that goal is where people start to disagree – there are lots of possible solutions. Here is my current favorite: roll out a hard fork that increases the maximum block size, and implements a rule to increase that size over time, very similar to the rule that decreases the block reward over time.”  Andresen added that the development community has always intended to raise the block size, but that a long-term scalability fix has yet to take place.  Bigger blocks are better  The bitcoin network is currently experiencing 50,000–80,000 transactions per day. As Andresen noted, however, the data needs being placed on the bitcoin network aren’t huge, making the 1-megabyte block size sufficient for use today.  In the long-term, though, this block size may lead to issues, Andresen wrote, arguing that the need to take action makes sense not only from a practical perspective but also an ideological one.  Andresen said that a hard fork to increase the block size is in line with the spirit of bitcoin, arguing:  “I think the maximum block size must be increased for the same reason the limit of 21 million coins must NEVER be increased: because people were told that the system would scale up to handle lots of transactions, just as they were told that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.”  Andresen suggested that the inflection point for the bitcoin block chain may come during a future price upswing, an event that has historically been associated with an increase in the number of bitcoin transactions.  Any fix needs time  Acknowledging the challenges involved, Andresen conceded that the process won’t be easy. However, he said that such work is inevitable, noting:  “Getting there won’t be trivial, because writing solid, secure code takes time and because getting consensus is hard. Fortunately, technological progress marches on, and Nielsen’s Law of Internet Bandwidth and Moore’s Law make scaling up easier as time passes.”  Andresen posited that the 50% annual growth rate he suggested would enable the distributed network to facilitate as many as 400 million transactions per day if implemented now. After 12 years, the bitcoin network’s estimated transaction capacity would reach 56 billion transactions per day, according to Andresen’s initial calculations.  This, Andresen said, would put the bitcoin network in a position to serve as a truly global value exchange system.  “Even if everybody in the world switched entirely from cash to bitcoin in 20 years, broadcasting every transaction to every fully-validating node won’t be a problem,” he concluded.
