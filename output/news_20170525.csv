42427562,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWPPh,1495750803,Crypto Traders See Red As Profit Taking Fuels Price Pullback,"The cryptocurrency markets are full of ups and downs – but perhaps there hasn't been a day in history quite like today.  Just hours after bitcoin set a new all-time high, it fell more than $400 in a matter of hours – but, it wasn't alone in seeing its direction dip into the red. Several other cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin lower, suffering notable losses, according to CoinMarketCap.  What caused these sharp declines? Profit taking, according to analysts polled by CoinDesk.  After robust inflows pushed the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies above $90bn (a monthly increase of roughly 200%), traders were simply taking money off the table.  After experiencing this notable rally, many cryptocurrencies started losing value, a development that coincided with the price of bitcoin falling more than 15% in a matter of hours, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals.  Several other top 10 cryptocurrencies also suffered losses of more than 10%, according to CoinMarketCap.  ""[Traders] took this opportunity to capitalize on the excessive hype that's been building up over the past few days in the space,"" said Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub.  While traders were seeking safety, their anxiety also helped fuel the broad drop in cryptocurrency prices, according to Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare. These market participants felt ""jittery"" after the recent gains, he told CoinDesk.  Even though bitcoin prices did fall notably during the session, some analysts described this decline as ""healthy"".  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, expressed positive sentiment regarding the fallback in prices, concluding:  ""Bitcoin had moved too far too fast. This is a healthy, call it a 'correction', coming on the heels of a very strong move it.""

42399917,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7ly,1495748548,Blockchain Entrepreneurs Target Apple and Google at Token Summit,"An inaugural conference focused on new use cases for cryptographic assets showcased today how blockchain-based applications that serve actual needs may be on the horizon.  But not everyone at Token Summit agreed on the market's direction. As panel after panel of entrepreneurs took the stage in New York, some in the audience remained skeptical – while even the panelists themselves expressed a note of caution.  To kick off the event, hosted at the NYU Stern School of Business, one of the earliest innovators in the crypto-space, Erik Voorhees – who sold his first bitcoin company, Satoshi Dice, in 2013 – revealed more details about digital currency exchange ShapeShift's new product, Prism.  Addressing the critics who say the cryptocurrency boom is little more than speculation, Voorhees positioned the work as part of the foundation for the next Facebook and Google.  Voorhees said:  ""The real use cases will come in the future, but if this technology is going to make an impact, there should be speculation today.""  Following Voorhees' address a number of panels continued with the theme of building real-world applications based on blockchain technology.  To build a real blockchain app  Speaking at the event, Brian Armstrong, co-founder of Coinbase, doubled down on a years-old theory: that developing economies would be the first to adopt these distributed applications.  His comments came after Coinbase demoed an ethereum-based messaging app, dubbed Token, at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2017 event earlier this week. It's a messaging app built with cryptocurrency tech under the hood – but perhaps more importantly, it also includes an interface that Armstrong described as the ""equivalent of HTML"", but for ethereum rather than the Web.  According to Armstrong, the developing world – and its estimated 2.5 billion underbanked individuals – is the primary target market for the app.  ""The main value of cryptocurrencies is bringing financial services to the developing world,"" said Armstrong. “That’s what we’re going to do with Token.""  Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Blockstack, which launched its decentralized browser this week, said his startup was seeking a similar goal: facilitating the development of new kinds of apps. To help get there, Ali announced that his company had offered a bounty to anyone who could find a bug between his application and decentralized storage providers IPFS, Sia and Storj.  Storj founder Shawn Wilkinson downplayed the potential competition between the projects, instead positioning their work from an enemy-of-my-enemy perspective.  ""We're all ideologically aligned to crush Amazon and other centralized services,"" said Wilkinson.  Slow progress  If the event showcased one thing, it's that there's little doubt that the road ahead with be characterized by slow and likely difficult progress.  Bitcoin-powered browser Brave has had its service live for months, and in six days will launch its initial coin offering for the Basic Attention Token (BAT).  Brave advisor Ankur Nandwani took the stage to explain how the browser startup, which has already raised $4.5m in venture capital, will leverage the token in an attempt to change user behavior.  Out of 1.5bn tokens that will be minted, 300m will be set aside in a ""development pool"" to incentivize content publishers and users alike to download the app, which blocks third-party advertisements.  ""Once you have users on the platform, advertisers will come,"" said Nandwani.  Another possible explanation, though, for the slow growth of the technology and adoption came from audience member and blockchain consultant Tone Vays, an outspoken critic of many decentralized applications.  Speaking to CoinDesk during a pause in activity on the stage, Vays said:  ""It's not about the application. None of these applications need decentralization. They are just using the hype of bitcoin’s technology to blow their valuations out of proportion.""  Blockchain honeymoon  Indeed, Maker software engineer Andy Milenius cautioned the crowd of investors, entrepreneurs and students about the potentially painful process that young crypto-investors will likely go through on their way to learning how to properly conduct due diligence on their investments.  ""They're going to learn, probably the hard way, what makes a good idea worth investing in,"" said Milenius.  Citing the vast separation between what companies like Apple and Dropbox can provide and what their decentralized counterparts can offer, Blockstack founder Muneeb Ali went even a step further, predicting a period of large-scale failures by ICO-backed companies before any kind of decentralized web becomes a reality.  Ali concluded:  ""Right now, we are in the honeymoon phase.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Brave.

42399920,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7mx,1495733070,Bank of Canada: DLT Won't Replace Canada's Payment System,"Canada's central bank likely won't launch a wholesale payment system based solely on distributed ledger tech, one of its senior officials said today.  Writing in an op-ed published by The Globe and Mail, Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins wrote that while the tech could underpin such a system ""one day"", issues that presented themselves during its Project Jasper initiative showcased the ""many hurdles to overcome"". The central bank unveiled its work with the tech last summer.  She went on to write:  ""The bottom line is that a stand-alone DLT wholesale system is unlikely to match the efficiency and net benefits of a centralized system. In fact, at its heart, there exists a fundamental inconsistency or tension between a centralized wholesale interbank payment system, as we have now, and the decentralization inherent in DLT.""  Among those obstacles: privacy. Wilkins wrote that, while a privacy solution was later incorporated into the ledger system, ""the fix made the system susceptible to the risk of a single point of failure"" – a state of affairs that she argued wasn't in line with some of the tech's core characteristics.  The number of transactions the system could process also proved problematic, according to Wilkins.  ""Another hurdle was scalability, which is still an issue in some versions of DLT. While other versions can achieve greater transaction rates by moving away from a fully decentralized framework, this can reduce resiliency and lessen some of the expected potential cost savings,"" she wrote.  Her op-ed included new details from the initiative's progression – Wilkins wrote about Project Jasper in February – while also noting that at least some of its elements could be applied elsewhere.  ""There are a host of further avenues that may be worth exploring, and these sorts of experiments offer a collaborative way forward to do just that,"" she wrote. ""Our present view is that the biggest net benefits, if any, would likely lie in the interaction of a DLT-based wholesale payments system with broader financial market infrastructure.""  Wilkins went on to conclude:  ""While these represent opportunities further down the road, Canada's payments system needs to be modernized in the short term. Though it won't involve distributed ledgers, it will involve a lot of innovation and collaboration.""

42399908,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7f5,1495728038,LocalBitcoins Trader Pleads Guilty to Money Transmitter Charge,"A Michigan LocalBitcoins trader plead guilty last week to operating an unlicensed money services business.  Federal prosecutors alleged that Sal Mansy, a resident of Detroit, advertising a bitcoin buying and selling service through LocalBitcoins, conducting $2,400,000 worth of business between August 2013 and July 2015.  According to court documents, undercover agents engaged in two trades between December 2014 and March 2015 with Mansy, for an amount totaling roughly 6.32 BTC – an amount worth a total of just under $1,900 at then-current prices.  Mansy is the second user of LocalBitcoins to plead guilty to the unlicensed money service charge this month. Missouri resident Jason Klein plead guilty to selling bitcoin to undercover agents on five separate occasions, and a seller from Rochester, New York named Richard Petix plead guilty to the same charge a week prior.  Court documents detail how Mansy would purchase bitcoin through digital currency exchanges Coinbase and Bitstamp, later selling the digital currency on LocalBitcoins and depositing the proceeds into bank accounts connected to a company he operated, TV TOYZ, which was also named in the government’s lawsuit.  Coinbase, according to a prosecutorial filing from 15th May of this year, closed Mansy’s account in June 2014 after questioning him about the nature of his account. Communications between Mansy and support staff for Coinbase and Bitstamp were included in that document, showing how both exchanges raised questions about Mansy’s bitcoin purchases and whether he had registered with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money transmitter.  The prosecutorial document shows that Mansy argued, in discussions with the US Department of Homeland Security, that he wasn’t operating a money transmission business.  ""According to Mansy, he had looked up the money service business requirements on the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) website and determined that his business model did not apply to that of a money service business,"" the filing stated.  Mansy faces as many as five years in prison and $250,000 in fines at sentencing later this year.

42399925,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7qt,1495717202,Consensus 2017: Even Academics Can't Keep Pace With Blockchain Change,"As blockchain startups take off, where will they find their workforce?      The onus often falls on universities to develop young people with the requisite skills. As a result, universities are now facing their own set of challenges – like finding qualified researchers willing to teach blockchain-related subjects and building industry partnerships at the risk of losing their own talent to deep-pocketed tech firms.    At a workshop at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference yesterday, five members of academia, representing MIT, Duke University and the University of Nicosia in Cyprus, gathered to discuss those and other issues.  Among their concerns was how the extra work involved in keeping up with the rapid pace of the blockchain industry was discouraging some professors from wanting to teach in the space.  Typically a professor puts together notes and slides for a course, and then reuses that material again and again, for years sometimes, explained Peter Rizun, managing editor of Ledger, a peer-reviewed journal focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.  In blockchain, though, that kind of advanced prep work is nearly impossible. Rizun shared instances where he himself would prepare for a lecture months ahead only to wake up one morning, read about a new paper or event online, and have to change everything. That adds extra cost for people teaching in the space.  ""Most of my colleagues will have nothing to do with it,"" Rizun said.  Others on the panel took the view that it was not academia's job to keep up with the rapid pace and ongoing drama of the cryptocurrency world.  ""Our role is to step back, and stay independent from the day-to-day,"" said Neha Narula, director of the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT. At a time when startups are plunging ahead with untested ideas, what the space needs more than anything is ""careful thought,"" she said.  George Giaglis, a professor at University of Nicosia, added that the real focus of universities should be on teaching classes in cryptography, finance and mechanism design, thereby giving students a framework to draw their own conclusions on things like bitcoin's ongoing block size debate.    Money talks        Another concern for the academics on the panel was finding a way to work closely with industry without worrying that cash-infused startups would lure away researchers and scientists with glamorous job offers.  The thirst for blockchain talent and information is so great, that students who have taken only a class or two in the subject can become sought after.  Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke University, brought up the example of one student who, after taking a single class on blockchain, went on to work as an intern at a major NY law firm. Soon after, according to Harvey, that student was led into the office of the senior partner at the law firm and asked to explain ‘blockchain’ to the CEO of one of the world’s largest banks.  According to MIT's Nerula, there just are not enough trained people in the workforce to fulfill the demands for blockchain jobs.  She said:  ""Startups and companies are looking for students with blockchain experience, and they are not finding them.""  The answer? Universities should partner with industry to create training programs for students, suggested Nerula. Otherwise, she said, companies in the blockchain space will not have a workforce.  Others on the panel, though, were quick to point out the dark side of working with industry.  Antonis Polemitis, CEO at University of Nicosia, pointed to the example, two years ago, when Uber, flush with cash, partnered with Carnegie Mellon, a top university for the study of robotics, and ended up poaching 40 of the school’s AI researchers and scientists.  ""This was a huge disaster for Carnegie Mellon, and for students passing through Carnegie,"" Polemitis said. ""The entire hub of AI knowledge basically moved over to Uber.""  Giaglis offered some reassurance.  ""We’ve been down this road before,"" he said, referring to the early '90s, when dot-com companies began buying up huge chunks of academia.  Regardless, he said, research centers survived, adding that people choose careers in academia for reasons other than money, such as prestige and the opportunity to do good and contribute to the world in ways that business does not always allow.  He concluded:  ""The incentives for academics are not purely financial – thank God.""

42399911,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7g4,1495713618,ICOs Going Mainstream? Chat App Kik to Launch Token Sale,"Messaging service Kik has revealed plans to launch its own cryptocurrency and ultimately create a new ecosystem for digital services.  The new digital token, called Kin, will be launched on the ethereum blockchain, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Today, the company released a white paper outlining its strategy for Kin, how it will be integrated into the app and how it hopes to create a wider ecosystem for buying and selling digital services.  The Canada-based company, which has raised over $120m in VC funding, said the cryptocurrency will ""combat the monopolization"" of digital services where a large companies exert more and more control over digital services.  ""These companies are the only ones with enough scale to effectively monetize through advertising,"" said Ted Livingston, CEO of Kik, arguing this makes it difficult for independent developers to monetize their services.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We think this is leading to a future for consumers and for society that has less choice, less innovation and ultimately less freedom.""  Some of the inspiration for the new token stems from Kik Points, a rewards system for users to access certain features inside the messaging app, but, Livingston said, the firm has been looking at the idea of a cryptocurrency since 2011.  Growing an ecosystem  Kik has now outlined multiple steps it will take for the creation of Kin and its ecosystem.  It will launch a token sale for the first Kin later in the summer and begin integrating the cryptocurrency into the Kik app where users buy and sell features and services like stickers, the use of bots and group chat hosting.  ""It will also give Kin value on the public exchanges,"" the CEO said. His company ultimately wants to spread Kin beyond its own app and create a decentralized ecosystem, using Kin, for all digital services.  To support these aims, the company will establish an independent non-profit called the Kin Foundation later this year or early next year. The organization will oversee the fair and open growth of the ecosystem, and further manage the Kin Rewards Engine, a financial incentive program to encourage uptake of the cryptocurrency and foster the ecosystem’s growth.  Livingston explained:  ""Every day, a certain amount of Kin will be given out to all the owners of the digital services proportional to the number of transactions that they drive in their particular digital service relative to the overall ecosystem.""  A game developer, for example, could transact with its players using Kin, and get a payment from the rewards engine. This will create more reason to continue accepting and transacting with the token.  ""Let's say you're creating 10% of all the transactions in the Kin ecosystem, you would get 10% of this daily reward,” Livingston said.  The foundation will also serve as an ID service, he added, likening it to a ""decentralized Facebook Connect"" that allows Kin users to move around the ecosystem:  “As a user when I show up to a new digital service, I start using Kin right away in a frictionless yet secure way.”  Kik has 15 million monthly active users and with this userbase, the company claims that Kin can become the “most adopted cryptocurrency in the world”.

42399929,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7rs,1495708210,How Blockchain Tech Could Move Self-Driving Cars Into the Fast Lane,"A future with autonomous vehicles is fast approaching – and with it, the idea that blockchain could connect automobiles and other Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices is getting its fair share of attention.  Even though smart houses (where doors, thermostats and appliances are connected to the internet for added functionality) may have seemed more trendy a year ago, blockchain startups are becoming drawn to the potential of connected cars.  ""Timing is everything,"" said John Gerryts, co-founder and CEO at Oaken. ""Now is the perfect time to begin building this stuff out.""  He went on to explain:  ""Everyone is in turn with it and on the same page with autonomous vehicles being within reach, depending on who you talk to, in the next 5–10 years.""  The ""stuff"" Gerryts is talking about includes developing a mechanism that would allow autonomous vehicles to be truly autonomous. This means that a car could refuel, recharge and park on its own – and pay for those services as well.  Opportunity at the edge  Most entrepreneurs in the self-driving car space, said Gerryts, are focused on mobility. However, Oaken is focused on the layers and support systems that could underlie this operation.  To the startup, these edges of the industry could use smart contracts running on a blockchain to connect everything. Plus, cars equipped with a repository of cryptocurrency could purchase services – say, a tune-up or an oil change – using an instantaneous and inexpensive payment rail.  Oaken sees itself taking care of the attestation of vehicles, inputting data on the blockchain to give vehicles a kind of digital identity. Once this identity is in place, Oaken can use GPS to follow the car, time-stamping its location on the blockchain.  The data gleaned from the connection of the vehicle to the internet, such as seasonality and traffic patterns, can also be used by consumers, application developers and manufacturers.  ""If everyone had everyone else’s data it would be a faster path to autonomous cars,"" according to James Johnson, cofounder and chief marketing officer at Oaken.  He said:  ""If these [original equipment manufacturers] and others want to accelerate the path to level-five autonomous driving, the best way to do that is through the blockchain to share all that data.""  But before autonomous cars, Oaken is looking to equip today's cars, those that could be manned by a human with the ability to purchase services using cryptocurrency.  The company recently built out a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a United Arab Emirates-sponsored hackathon, which won first place. The project allowed Tesla cars to pay road tolls over the ethereum network.  While nothing commercial has come out of the PoC yet, Gerryts said, the company has been head’s down on the project for the Toyota Research Institute, which announced this week that it will form a consortia with multiple blockchain startup partners to focus on potential uses of blockchain.  Oaken has also been developing a system for short-term vehicle leasing. Whether it's individuals, manufacturers or other companies with fleets, the firm wants to find a way to allow them to rent out or lease vehicles in exchange for payment. And all that data and monetary transfer will happen over a blockchain.  The startup has come up with a decentralized application (dapp) on the ethereum testnet that allows people to register their vehicles for short-term lease, and one at the other end that allows people to go in and sign up to lease those vehicles.  With the announcement, Oaken and the other blockchain startups in the Toyota consortium – including Gem, BigchainDB and Commuterz – aim to capture the interest of large original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). That effort, they hope, will help get the blockchain-connected hardware into vehicles' components before market.  Unlocking the middleman's money  Uber’s valuation is more than $60bn, and all the company does is act as a matchmaker.  Johnson asked:  “What if there was a direct relationship between the vehicle owner and the consumer?”  By cutting out Uber or Lyft as the middleman, drivers would make more money without the up-to-20% fee they charge, and consumers would get cheaper rides.  All manufacturers and OEMs are looking at how to get a piece of this pie. And while manufacturers might be selling less cars, Johnson continued, they’ll get more revenue per car – or rather than selling cars, offer pay-per-use models.  Further, as Oaken is thinking about the future of smart cities, it makes sense to utilize the roadways for ride-sharing, because, in most US cities, there are about 100 times more roads than there are mass transit lines, Johnson said.  “The opportunity is so big that I think all these different players in the [blockchain] space are now trying to get that solution built,” Johnson told CoinDesk.  Reinventing insurance  One area that will absolutely change as short-term leasing of individual cars becomes more popular is car insurance.  “Insurance has always been built with 12 months in mind,” said Johnson. “Now, we’re building insurance products for five minutes or 20 minutes.”  Many experts have predicted a move towards usage-based insurance (UBI) or 'pay as you drive' (PAYD), not only because of short-term leasing, but because of the proliferation of telematic devices and smartphones that can be used to monitor the driving behaviors of individuals in an effort to give them discounts or better premiums for good driving.  “Usage-based insurance will be dynamic enough to charge you less on Tuesdays than Wednesdays if you're a better driver on the former day,” said Gerryts.  The problem with these models is that insurance is supposed to be a pooling mechanism for distributing costs across multiple people and, in turn, keeping them down.  Plus, telematic monitoring can sometimes put certain demographics at a disadvantage. For instance, most insurers will dock points for driving late at night into the early morning because statistically speaking that’s when most accidents happen. However, this puts people that work late-night and overnight shifts at a disadvantage.  However, Toyota’s insurance entity is also part of the research initiative, so these challenges are being worked through, according to Gerryts.  Johnson said:  “The discrimination of usage-based insurance – autonomous cars could solve this.”  Futuristic car image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | ETH | RESEARCH,Bailey Reutzel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/05/25/how-blockchain-tech-could-move-self-driving-cars-into-the-fast-lane,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/867fd68bf5a0053b9f440b1fab3edb848dbfe30b-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42399926,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbz7sr,1495702821,Consensus 2017: Advice From a Lawyer to ICOs: 'Don’t Be Stupid',"One expert blockchain attorney has simple advice for blockchain companies currently navigating regulatory uncertainty.  Though the technology has been up for discussion for years, laws aren't very clear right now with a tangle of regulatory bodies that all might, or might not, have some power over different aspects of the technology. Bitcoin has seen some progress in that respect, but with other projects like ethereum now emerging, an entirely new ecosystem of use cases is springing up.  Much of the conversation during the CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 legal workshop centered on this confusing state of affairs.  Harvard Berkman Center fellow and special counsel at Cooley LLP Patrick Murck argued that, while this regulatory uncertainty might cause problems for businesses, it's actually better that regulators are so far taking a hands-off approach to blockchain companies and letting the ecosystem develop it's own system for weeding out bad actors.  In the meantime, though, he had some advice:  ""As long as you're not stupid or have ill-intent, most of the time you're going to be fine. It's amazing how common-sensical this could be. Don't be stupid. Don't have ill-intent.""  Uncertainty redoubled  Another trend discussed during the panel, one that very much related to this uncertainty, was the growing spread of initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The potential for ICOs (or token sales) was one of the more prominent themes at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference at large, and it popped up again and again during the day's three-hour legal session.  Advocates argued that the concept is fueling a new, more democratic way of funding businesses inspired by cryptocurrency, but it could also have its downsides amid the recent hype cycle.  ""What we have now is the term 'ICOs'. I don't know who started that, but they should be reprimanded for it,"" Perkins Coie partner Dax Hansen joked, adding that 'token sale' is a term with better regulatory implications. Though, as for the concept itself, he said that many entrepreneurs are using the funding model in legitimate and promising ways.  And, it's indeed an exploding market right now. Davis Polk associate Reuben Grinberg claimed that over half of venture spending in the space now comes from ICOs, rather than older, arguably less democratic, methods of raising money.  A panelist from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) noted that this form of funding is exploding, doubling just in the last few weeks.  ""I think you’re right that it's starting to reach a level where regulators will take a look at it. Where that goes, I don’t know,"" he added.  But even if regulators have held back so far, other legal experts think that more regulatory action could be around the corner. Grinberg, for one, argued that catastrophe might ultimately be what piques the action of regulators.  He said:  ""When everyone's making money, then everyone's happy, but when everyone's losing money and their houses – which has happened in the past – then you're going to start to see regulatory actions.""
