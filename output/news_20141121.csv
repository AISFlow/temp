42377841,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73j5V,1416608412,Crypto 2.0 Roundup: Ethereum's Counterparty Fork and a Vote for Colored Coins,"Moving into the holiday season, the crypto 2.0 segment of the bitcoin industry continues to garner increasing attention for its efforts to expand the potential use cases for blockchain technology.  However, after months of heightened activity and exciting launches that saw the community come into sharper focus, the last few weeks have shown that the sector may now be focusing on refining its message for a wider audience.  Ethereum fires back at Counterparty  Arguably the most visible event of the news cycle occurred when crypto 2.0 protocol Counterparty announced that it had ported Ethereum's smart contracts system, a move that it alleged brought all the functionality of the unlaunched project to its protocol, and by extension, the bitcoin blockchain.  Though often hyped and distorted in the media, there was strong agreement that the move would now present developers with options that articulate some of the larger debates ongoing in the bitcoin space. For example, entreprenuers who want to implemenet smart contract systems on top of crypto 2.0 systems can now chose to build on top of bitcoin through Counterparty or on a new blockchain with Ethereum.  In an effort to showcase that its platform was as robust as its competitor's, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin quickly fired back, copying over the Counterparty protocol to Ethereum, a process he claims took just three hours.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Buterin explained that he intended the rebuttal to be a joke, though its one that also showcases the utility of his platform:  ""The only real serious portion of the intent there is that it shows how powerful Ethereum is where it can gobble up any of these protocols very quickly.""  Buterin said that the move will enable developers who use Ethereum to do ""anything they can do with Counterparty on Ethereum"" when it launches. In turn, Buterin offered a counterargument to what he called the ""crazy"" idea that an independent block chain is unnecessary for bitcoin projects, a claim made by Counterparty chief architect Adam Krellenstein.  ""The attitude is that bitcoin is supposed to be the one blockchain to rule them all, my opinion is that having lots of coins is great,"" he added.  Buterin's thoughts on this trend, as well as its potentially negative repercussions for wider ecosystem development, are developed further in a post for the Ethereum blog.  SEC impact still evident  Evidence indicates that the still unproven rumour that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking into crypto 2.0 projects is continuing to have an influence on the nascent industry.  Decentralised crowdfunding platform Swarm, for example, has announced it has enlisted Harvard and MIT professors for an event that will examine the legal considerations that entrepreneurs face when building new products in the developing bitcoin and crypto 2.0 space.  Swarm has told CoinDesk there will be more forthcoming details released about the event, entitled ""Cryptoledgers and the Law"" and scheduled for 17th–19th January.  Elsewhere in the ecosystem, a partnership between digital asset liquidity exchange Melotic and crypto 2.0 gold trading platform DigitalTangible has been altered proactively in the face of regulatory concerns. Previously, the two platforms were integrated so that DigitalTangible users could directly trade the gold tokens they purchased on Melotic through the platform.  However, Melotic CEO Jack Wang told CoinDesk that this functionality is no longer available. Both parties confirmed that regulatory uncertainty was the primary cause.  ""We are reaching out to the SEC to confirm the authority we have to allow our customers to trade exchange tokens from within our platform,"" DigitalTangible CEO Taariq Lewis said.  Lewis went on to explain that DigitalTangible customers can still use the Meltoic exchange independently, and that the two companies remain friendly.  ""We'll continue to look for opportunities to work together in the future,"" Wang said.  Coinprism debuts dividends feature  On the other end of the crypto 2.0 spectrum, colored coins project Coinprismhttp://blog.coinprism.com/2014/11/17/colored-coin-denominated-dividends/, which offers an Android wallet for colored coins as well as tools for asset trading, introduced a new dividends functionality this week.  Coinprism uses the Open Assets protocol, a protocol built on top of bitcoin to allow the exchange of colored coins, or bitcoins that have been ""colored"" or altered to represent decentralized assets.  The new feature allows users to an amount of bitcoin to be evenly split up amongst any number of asset holders.  Speaking to CoinDesk, founder Flavien Charlon explained how the feature could open new marketplaces for things like votes or event tickets:  ""Companies who used colored coins for raising money can now use dividends to organize a vote amongst the coin holders, and all of this is fully transparent through the blockchain.""  Expanding on ideas in the formal announcement, Charlon indicated that users could create a new asset, such as a ""votecoin"" for voting, which could then be sent by recipients to predefined addresses. Votes could then be tallied by looking at the results in separate wallets for collecting yes and no votes.  Perhaps most interestingly, he said this would enable votes to be resold on an open market such as MasterXchange, an asset exchange built on the mastercoin protocol that supports colored coins.  ""If you don't care about a vote, you can resell the vote on the free market to someone who cares about it,"" he said, before noting that such functionality could be applied to any smart property, whether its voting or invitations to a corporate event.

42377826,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73imd,1416603052,"Netagio to Exit Gold Market, Enter Euro and USD","British bitcoin exchange Netagio is exiting the gold market next month due to weak demand.  The exchange will remove its two order books for gold trading by the end of the year, according to Netagio CEO Simon Hamblin.  Netagio  will instead enter the dollar and euro markets, with new order books for trading bitcoin for those currencies to be launched in mid-December. The company declined to specify a date.  Hamblin said the firm is repositioning itself to tackle the larger euro and dollar markets, while leaving its longstanding links to the gold industry behind.  ""We're receiving this demand from customers and we really want to reposition the business ... [So] we're going to be removing the gold from our offering,"" he said.  Pound market dwarfed by euro, dollar  Netagio was spun out of GoldMoney Group, a gold storage services provider, that was established in 1991. Hamblin declined to provide details on user growth at Netagio.  Euro trading volumes were about 2.4 times greater than volumes in pound sterling in the last six months, according to data from Bitcoinity. The US dollar market is even larger, with trading volumes of about 13.5 times more than the euro market for the same time frame.  The largest market by trading volume is the yuan-bitcoin currency pair, which accounted for a 75% share of volume, according to Bitcoinity, although this figure is likely inflated because the major exchanges dealing in that market don't charge a fee for trades.  Hamblin is hopeful that Netagio's move into larger markets will translate into a boost in business.  ""The GBP market is fairly small compared to other markets ... [The euro and US dollar] markets are substantially bigger than the UK market. Therefore we expect demand to be there,"" he said.  Hamblin said he believed that British exchanges have lagged behind over-the-counter trading (OTC) in the pound-BTC market. These trades are enabled by marketplaces like Localbitcoins or Bittylicious, which help buyers and sellers locate each other to trade pounds for bitcoins and vice versa. Exchanges are left with anaemic trading volumes as a result.  ""The majority of trades are happening in the GBP market are happening as OTC trades,"" Hamblin said.  British banks block bitcoin businesses  The market for bitcoin-pounds trading has been hampered by British banks' refusal to work with bitcoin businesses. In September, the payments firm Capital Treasury Services cut ties with bitcoin companies on the Isle of Man after it was pressured to do so by the banks it worked with.  In contrast to bank's hardline stance against bitcoin, government officials and politicians in the United Kingdom have adopted an open stance toward digital currencies. The Chancellor has ordered a Treasury study on digital currencies, while a shadow cabinet minister has lauded bitcoin's potential to reduce consumer reliance on big banks.  Hamblin said that the opposing regulatory signals and banks' ambivalence towards bitcoin could indicate that the financial institutions were lagging regulators in adapting to digital currencies. More concrete reassurance from the state would be required before banks relaxed their stance towards bitcoin firms, he said.  ""It would appear to me that the banks are waiting for some kind of regulatory view before they start opening up their relationships [with bitcoin companies], [although] the noises from the various regulatory bodies are probably one of the most positive in the world,"" Hamblin said.

42377833,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73iuB,1416595829,ANX Acquisition Revives Troubled Bitcoin Exchange Justcoin,"ANX has acquired the domain name and brand rights to troubled Norway-based bitcoin exchange Justcoin.  The exchange, which lists bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin, and is also a gateway for crypto payment protocols Ripple and Stellar, will resume operations next week under new management. ANX plans to revive the exchange formally on 24th November.  Justcoin was forced to suspend operations on 28th October, after its banking partner severed ties with the company. At the time, the exchange said it was unable to secure an alternative banking partner in Norway.  Earlier this week, Justcoin tweeted that it would be back shortly, but it did not provide any further details about the ANX deal.    Justcoin. com will be back under new mangement starting November 24th. Check your email.      — Justcoin Exchange (@jstcoin) November 18, 2014    Debit cards for European customers  ANX announced the acquisition in a statement released earlier today that positioned the move in terms of its larger goals.  The company said it is expanding its global presence through the acquisition, and that the deal intends to bolster ANX’s presence in the European market.  Hugh Madden, CTO of ANX, explained:  “We have long recognized the vital role Europe has in the global cryptocurrency marketplace. The addition of Justcoin to the ANX portfolio of companies will broaden our global footprint and significantly increase our customer base. ANX can now provide direct local services such as bitcoin debit cards to our clients in Europe.”  ANX announced its bitcoin debit card back in June and setting up a European operation for this market could make it appeal to a wider audience.  Regional brand lives on  Justcoin will continue operations under the same brand, but it will now be a part of ANX and use ANX technology.  ANX said it was able to migrate the Justcoin platform in ""less than a week"", with the ANX proprietary trading engine.  Justcoin was founded last year by Klaus Bugge Lund and Andreas Brekken. In April, the company said it had 20,000 customers, 16,000 of whom were based outside of its home market.  The company gradually began to suspend operations in early October, due to payments issues and it was eventually forced to halt all operations later that month.

42377840,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73j4F,1416587591,BitX Creates 'Sexy' Mobile Apps to Draw New Bitcoin Users,"Multinational bitcoin exchange and wallet provider BitX has released mobile apps for iOS and Android that it hopes will attract newcomers by 'making bitcoin sexy'.  Apart from their wallet functionality, the apps also allow new users to sign up and authenticate their accounts via their mobile devices, including using the built-in camera to create copies of documents for know-your-customer (KYC) procedures in different jurisdictions.  KYC-verified Android users can also use the app to buy and sell bitcoins, while iOS users can use Apple's fingerprint-based Touch ID to authenticate transactions.  Sporty engine, but...  BitX launched the apps with an announcement posted on Medium titled 'Making Bitcoin Sexy', comparing bitcoin so far to a high-performance sports car engine ""with the body of a bus"".    Product Advisor Simon Dingle wrote that in BitX's target markets, the emerging economies of the world, winning mobile users' over first would be key to bitcoin's growth:    ""At BitX we build bitcoin products for global use, but our company’s presence in emerging markets in particular has shown us first-hand what mobile will become. In these countries phones are already the de facto primary computing devices. While the rest of the world is focused on ‘digital natives’, the developing world is mobile native.""  Just as the web was a niche hobby until it became simpler to use and more visually appealing, he said, so too did bitcoin in order to attract users who might not consider it otherwise.  Forward looking approach  BitX's mobile apps apps definitely have a greater focus on design than many other offerings already on the market.  ""When designing our apps we chose to disregard prior art in the bitcoin space and come up with new paradigms,"" said Dingle, adding that simplicity and minimalism came first.  The cloudy blue background seems chosen to soothe to those about to send their first bits, with the balance clearly displayed front and center in a large circle (which BitX describes as a ""metaphor for a coin""). Tapping the circle produces the current exchange rate in whatever currency you have currently selected for display, plus a selection of other international options.  Balances below 0.01 BTC are displayed as 'bits'.  Send and receive options are easy to use, using either standard QR codes or BitX's send-by-email function. In the latter case, existing BitX customers will receive the amounts via email, while non-customers will receive directions on how to set up an account and redeem.  BitX's HTML5 web app has also been redesigned to match the mobile interface, giving users a familiar experience across different devices.  Avoiding complexity  To better protect users' funds, the apps have two-factor authentication built in.  Asked whether BitX intended to implement more sophisticated security features like multisig, user-controlled keys or HD wallets, Dingle said that, while the merits of those features had been discussed and have a strong role in bitcoin's future, BitX's main objective at this point is to mainstream bitcoin and this sometimes meant keeping ""early adopter"" technology to a minimum.  BitX's high support and service standards would take the place of complex technological problems for people too busy to take care of such things themselves, he added.  Banking background  Singapore-based BitX, which operates exchanges in more countries and arguably more unconventional locations than other big bitcoin startups, has its origins in the traditional banking software world.  The firm has exchanges with local offices and support staff in South Africa, Namibia and Kenya, and recently opened its latest bitcoin exchange in Malaysia.  The BitX apps are available worldwide on Google Play and the iOS App Store.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/21/bitx-creates-sexy-mobile-apps-to-draw-new-bitcoin-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37b88f58b9078a98c1b8fb16cfd6b44c36f73a5f-1452x622.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377848,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73j9H,1416577616,4 New Bitcoin Startups Showcase at DEMO Fall 2014,"Day three of the DEMO Fall 2014 conference in California featured a bitcoin and FinTech track that saw four new bitcoin startups debut their products.  Now in its 24th year, DEMO stages conferences in the United States, China, Brazil, Russia and Vietnam that focus on emerging technologies and new product innovations. Well-known companies such as Evernote, Salesforce and VMWare have all launched at the conference in previous years.  Erick Schonfeld, the event's executive producer, kicked off the bitcoin and FinTech session yesterday, telling the audience there was a need for a bitcoin component at the event and pointing out: “We’re starting to see new products built on top of the blockchain.”  A panel of three judges was present to question the startups after their pitch: Scott Robinson, FinTech Director for tech startup accelerator Plug and Play; Bobby Goodlatte, an angel investor in Coinbase; and Rick Yang, principal at VC firm NEA.  The four new startups were:  Obsidian  Obsidian  sees the BTC/USD market as a huge opportunity and is working to create an exchange where users “know with a very high degree of certainty how much [they] are going to pay for bitcoin”.  To accomplish this, the company is building a new US-based exchange. The team says it has a banking partnership in place and that it is pairing up with two institutional bitcoin liquidity providers to ensure buy and sell orders on its platform are not exposed to slippage.  Founder Justin Litchfield told the audience he was able to leverage his “multigenerational relationship with a bank"" to start the company.  SmartContract  SmartContract  is building blockchain-based programmable contract systems. CEO Sergey Nazarov told the audience the startup's goal is to “fulfill the full potential of the blockchain by creating trust”.  Although there are a number of startups looking into digital agreements built on top of blockchain technology, SmartContract aimed to differentiate itself by launching a handful of products at DEMO.  These included a contract for stabilized bitcoin payments and conditional bitcoin escrow based on external data sources that create parameters for the contract.  SmartContract said it is using multisignature authentication for its escrow product.  Pavilion  Founded by 17-year-olds Brendan Duhamel and Jamie Young, Pavilionhttps://pavilion.io/requestTransaction aims to partner with large auction or marketplace websites to offer transparent bitcoin escrow services, while eliminating escrow fees and escrow providers.  Pavilion is targeting big players like eBay and Alibaba as potential customers, with the aim of making money from what they term a ""white-label subscription-based platform"".  At the event, the founders showed off Pavilion’s interface, where marketplace customers could view the escrow flow on the bitcoin blockchain.  Pavilion now joins Bitwage as part of Plug and Play’s new class of bitcoin startups.  HelloBit  By building a smartphone app for remittances, HelloBit plans to use bitcoin as a pipeline to send money around the globe. The firm matches buyers and sellers on its platform and charges a fee on top.  Co-founder Ali Goss said the company wants to allow people to send bitcoin via SMS, then the recipients can go to exchanges in their local market to get fiat. People won’t need to necessarily know the technology is bitcoin, only that HelloBit provides a cross-border payment.  The company is hoping to partner with bitcoin wallet and exchange providers to roll out its service.  HelloBit was initially working within South American countries, however, the firm says it has seen a lot interest in the Indian and Philippine markets, and that it has shifted focus to these areas.

42377839,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73j2z,1416568386,"Dutch Exchange CleverCoin Expands Internationally, Adds Card Deposits","CleverCoin opened its bitcoin exchange to the wider European market today, while adding MasterCard and Visa credit and debit cards to its list of available payment options.  Founded in January, CleverCoin had been serving customers solely in the Netherlands for two months prior to the announcement. The company notably garnered more international notice for its attempts to help relaunch troubled Norwegian bitcoin exchange Justcoin, though it is no longer involved in the effort.  CleverCoin now offers its EUR/BTC order-book exchange in more than 30 countries, including France, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CleverCoin CEO Karsten Nilsen described the move as one that would help bring bitcoin to more general consumers in its target markets.  Nilsen said simply:  ""There are a lot of European countries where everything is done with credit cards.""  With the announcement, credit card payments join Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) bank transfers and Netherlands-based e-commerce payment system iDEAL as available funding options for CleverCoin customers.  CleverCoin pledged to continue to add payment options to its exchange, provided they support its larger goals of making bitcoin buying more convenient and secure.  The company charges 0.3% trading fees and has formed a partnership with payments-as-a-service provider Lemon Way, which helps facilitates transactions via credit and debit cards.  Verification process update  In addition to the updated funding options, CleverCoin has also altered the way it will seek to verify the identities of exchange users pursuant to know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.  Customers must still provide proof of ID and proof of address, but they can now satisfy the second portion of these requirements with a 'selfie' photograph.  Customers can now elect to have a letter mailed to their place of residence, which they must then include in a photograph of themselves and upload to the exchange.  Nilsen went on to explain that customers must provide additional information in order to connect their bank accounts for purchases, though Dutch residents can simply send a payment via the iDEAL network.  Overcoming obstacles  The announcement is a step forward for CleverCoin, which had reported experiencing trouble when seeking a banking partnership earlier this year.  Although local startups have arguably struggled to gain regional support, bitcoin has maintained a strong presence in the Netherlands, with a number of notable merchant partnerships seeking to highlight the utility of the technology taking place already this year.  Most recently, Dutch startup BitStraat teamed with BitPay to giveaway 100 bitcoin point-of-sale (POS) terminals to Amsterdam merchants, as part of a campaign to turn the city into the ""bitcoin capital of the world"".  The project notably followed Bitcoin Boulevard, which this summer united 10 merchants to accept bitcoin in the Hague.

42377837,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73j0T,1416545421,"Lamassu: Bitcoin ATM Owners Earning Up to $36,000 Per Year","Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Lamassu has released new data with the aim of illustrating how its core product is proving profitable for owners.  Lamassu  has reported its bitcoin ATM operators now process an average of $20,000-worth of bitcoin each month, while units placed in prime locations receive as much as $40,000–$60,000 in monthly transactions.  The data release comes more than one year after Lamassu shipped its first bitcoin ATM unit, and is the result of an informal survey that asked the company's operators to self-report earnings and volume information.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Lamassu CEO Zach Harvey framed the findings as evidence that, despite bitcoin's recent struggles against the US dollar, average consumers remain interested in the digital currency.  Harvey said:  ""What our machines represent is the man on the street, the guy who just wants to put in $10 in bitcoin or $200 in bitcoin. We didn't know what to expect, there's always a question mark until you realize that your operators are actually profitable and that this is a service that can really work.""  Lamassu's survey estimated that its operators earn between $1,000–$3,000 each month on an average commission of 5.5%. This equates to annual earnings for ATM operators of between $12,000 and $36,000 per unit.  Harvey defined a prime location as an ATM in an area that is easily accessible, citing the company's units in New York City and Helsinki, Finland, as examples of prime locations.  The company reported it began seeking data from operators this past summer, and that it believes the published figures paint a consistent picture of what its operators experience.  ""These are the numbers that we keep seeing over and over again,"" Harvey added.  Operators affirm data  CoinDesk reached out to a number of Lamassu bitcoin ATM operators to verify that the company's reported figures offer a true reflection of their actual business.  Some, like Liberty Teller co-founder Chris Yim, who operates a number of machines in the Boston metropolitan area, for example, found the numbers to be accurate.  ""The monthly volume is similar to what we've seen from our incremental machines,"" he said, before noting that final operator revenue is dependent on the fees charged by owners.  Similarly, Adam O'Brien, president of Bitcoin Solutions, reported the numbers were ""spot on"" in regards to the earnings the machines provided. However, he noted that Bitcoin Solutions charges a commission of 8% on its units.  O'Brien went on to suggest his volume figures were lower than the average provided by Lamassu, adding: ""Our Lamassu in Edmonton has seen over $70,000 in gross volume since our launch in February.""  Emerging market struggles  Although operators in more developed bitcoin markets found the figures to be accurate, ATM owners in regions that are arguably still warming to the technology told a different tale.  Pablo Gonzalez, CEO of Mexico-based bitcoin exchange Bitso, noted that his Lamassu unit processes only $3,000 in transactions each month, and that it is not generating any profit.  Still, Gonzalez reported that he was satisfied with the unit, which serves to help promote both his main business and bitcoin to the wider community.  ""We knew that when we purchased our ATM as we are positioned at a nascent bitcoin market,"" he said, before adding that he expects interest to increase as adoption rises.  Slovakia-based ATM operator Marián Jančuška, by contrast, indicated that his machine has so far suffered from frequent outages relating to its connection to bitcoin exchange Bitstamp.  ""I had to disable this interface to make the machine stable. It took until about two weeks ago for Lamassu to deliver an upgrade with working Bitstamp interface,"" Jančuška explained.  Jančuška stated that due to these issues, his machine processes just €10,000 each month and that the machine is not yet profitable.
