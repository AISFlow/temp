Jason William Siesser admitted in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri he attempted to pay $52 in bitcoin per vial of an unnamed chemical weapon on two occasions in the summer of 2018.  Prosecutors said the ""highly toxic chemical"" was potent enough to ""kill approximately 300 persons"" at the levels Siesser sought, and that he had told the seller he planned to use them imminently.  Siesser, whom FBI agents detained within minutes of the package's arrival in late August 2018, also admitted on Tuesday to identity theft. He had had the package sent to a juvenile living at his address ""because [Siesser] did not want to get in trouble if the purchase was traced to him,"" the plea deal stated.  The package Siesser ultimately received contained an inert substance, not a chemical weapon. Even so, agents found a potentially deadly trio - cadmium arsenide, cadmium metal and hydrochloric acid - at Siesser's Missouri residence.  Siesser faces a minimum five-year sentence, according to a press release from the Department of Justice.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,2587 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,005-$11,419  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    After wild Sunday action that saw the price of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency fall as low as $10,050 on spot exchanges like Coinbase, bitcoin is trading relatively flat, at around $11,200 Tuesday. “The asset is trading in a narrow range of $11,080 to $11,220,” said Constantine Kogan, a partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital. “To continue last week’s rally, bitcoin needs to overcome the resistance level, which is in the $11,300- $11,400 region,” he added.      Katie Stockton, analyst for Fairlead Strategies, says the bitcoin market is weaker after traders scurried in late July to buy, leading to an “overbought” situation for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency. “We view sideways price action as constructive,” she said. “Bitcoin has gained approximately 29% since July’s low, and is now due for consolidation.”      Read More: Bitcoin Futures Interest Soars as Bond Yields Fall to Record Lows      Money printing from the Federal Reserve is one reason why the case for buying bitcoin sustains, says BitBull’s Kogan. “The sharp rise in bitcoin is associated with the weakening of several world currencies – the dollar and the Chinese yuan,” he said. According to the Fed, the M1 money supply, which constitutes cash and cash equivalents, has increased from $4 trillion at the start of February to $5.3 trillion at the end of July, a 33% increase.      Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, is bullish on a higher bitcoin price. “We are now at higher lows and now have a genuinely tested support line at $11,000,” Tu said. “Bitcoin seems to be trending upwards now.”      Read More: As Fed Nears Inflation Rubicon, Analysts See $50K Bitcoin in Play    Record DEX volumes    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Tuesday, trading around $387 after slipping 1.8% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

According to data aggregator Dune Analytics, DEX volumes approached $4.3 billion this past month, four times the volume than in June and a twelvefold increase since July 2019. Leading the way was Uniswap’s DEX, followed by stablecoin swapping platform Curve.      “Uniswap has really grown tremendously over the course of the last year,” said Efficient Frontier’s Tu. He also noted technological improvements and incentives that increase liquidity have helped the growth of DEXs. “This is due to the automated market making, or AMM, innovations seen in the space, as well as due to liquidity mining.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Tuesday.

42384340,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWqzD,1596566844,'Rat Poison Squared on Steroids': What's New in Bitcoin's Latest Lightning Release,"All eyes are on bitcoin's bullish price at the moment. Behind the scenes, however, developers are tinkering to build the infrastructure that many hope could make the Bitcoin system more accessible to more people.      Last week, Bitcoin tech startup Blockstream released its latest major version of c-lightning, its implementation of the Lightning Network. The release is dubbed ""Rat Poison Squared on Steroids,"" facetiously referencing Warren Buffet's comment that Bitcoin is ""rat poison squared"" and, in his opinion, investors will get burned if they put their money into it.      Of course, c-lightning's developers probably don't believe Bitcoin is ""rat poison,"" seeing as they're working full time to scale bitcoin payments. The Lightning Network is pitched as the future of Bitcoin because it ushers in faster and cheaper payments and scales the network so it can support many, many more users than it currently can support without slowing it down.      Read more: What Is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?      With this release, Bitcoin's Lightning Network gradually continues to make headway. Here's a dive into the major pieces of the latest release.    MPP-sending for more reliable payments    Multi-part payments (MPP) are one feature that will improve the Lightning Network's user experience (UX). Sometimes payments fail when the software can't find a path to the user. This is especially likely to occur when payments are bigger; large payments require an adequate amount of liquidity in all the channels between the sender’s node and the receiver’s. If there isn’t enough liquidity to support passing the payment along, the payment will fail.      MPP effectively splits payments into smaller pieces so they're easier to send across the network, making payments more reliable.      Read more: ‘Multi-Part’ Payments Could Bring Bigger Bitcoin Sums to Lightning Network      ""The most obvious feature is that we now can pay with multi-part payments,"" Blockstream Lightning engineer Rusty Russell told CoinDesk.      C-lightning has been able to receive MPP payments since last year, ""but Christian [Decker, Blockstream engineer] finally got around to implementing the sending side,"" Russell said.      This is a piece of a much broader effort to update Lightning's UX to hopefully attract more users. MPP was discussed by developers back at a Lightning developer summit back in 2018 in Adelaide, Australia.    Watchtowers fight fraud    Watchtowers is a fraud-fighting component of the Lightning Network that is early on in its creation. A watchtower ""watches"" a user's bitcoin in the Lightning Network to make sure it's safe. If someone tries to cheat, the watchtower detects the infraction and responds by penalizing the offending user.      Read more: Bitcoin Lightning Fraud? Laolu Is Building a ‘Watchtower’ to Fight It      C-lightning has made changes to make it easier for watchtowers to hitch up to c-lightning. Blockstream engineer Christian Decker ""added enough information that a plugin can easily support a watchtower,"" Russell told CoinDesk. ""We tell it exactly what transaction it would need to publish if the previous (cheating) transaction were to appear.""      Like plug-ins in other software, such as the Google Chrome browser or a music-making program, a plug-in in c-lightning adds extra functionality to the c-lightning node.      Russell noted the Lightning watchtower Eye of Satoshi is already using this new feature.    Coin tracking for taxes    C-lightning has laid the groundwork for a tool to track ""all"" of a user's coin movements, Russell told CoinDesk.      This could come in handy for anyone worried about tracking their Lightning coins come tax season, so they can figure out what they owe the IRS.      Read more: Crypto Taxes: Still Confused After All These Years      This underlying tracking work has been added to this release. The next step is to make this functionality available for users. Neigut is ""putting the final touches"" on a plug-in that ""records everything your accountant will want to know about where your money came from and went,"" Russell said.      ""Seems she is actually looking forward to next tax year so she can use this in anger :),"" he added.    Other changes    While these are a few of the most significant changes, there are plenty more.      C-lightning now supports sending keysend transactions, which offers a new way to tip others with Lightning payments. And Russell mentioned that the developer team has been ""re-engineering everything"" to support a new bitcoin transaction format called PSBT (partially signed bitcoin transactions), which facilitates transactions with hardware wallets, a secure method of storing bitcoin since the device remains disconnected from the internet.

42384352,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWrAX,1596565804,US Lawmakers Don't Want Proof-of-Stake Networks to Get Overtaxed,"Crypto holders earning new tokens by staking their coins might be at risk of being overtaxed, believe several members of Congress.      Four lawmakers wrote a letter to the Internal Revenue Service Wednesday, asking the U.S. tax agency to ensure stakers don’t face tax liabilities for receiving block rewards before they sell their new tokens.      The letter, dated July 29, was sent to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, Chief Counsel Michael Desmond and Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy David Kautter and was signed by the Congressional Blockchain Caucus’ co-chairs Reps. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), Bill Foster (D-Ill.), Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and Darren Soto (D-Fla.).      “It is possible the taxation of ‘staking’ rewards as income may overstate taxpayers’ actual gains from participating in this new technology,” the letter said. “It could also result in a reporting and compliance nightmare, for taxpayers and the Service alike.”      Read more: Even the IRS Admits Some Crypto Tax Regulations Are ‘Not Ideal’      The caucus clarified staking rewards should be taxed appropriately. “We believe that taxpayers’ true gains from these tokens should indeed be taxed,” the letter said.      Abraham Sutherland, a lecturer at the University of Virginia, told CoinDesk these concerns include the fact that staking protocols could create new blocks – and therefore, release new tokens – every few minutes, hours or days.      Each of these blocks could be treated as an independent taxable event, meaning taxpayers could potentially have hundreds of taxable events every year, which would be a headache for both the taxpayer and the IRS to assess, he said.    Metaphors    Treating staking as a source of income might cause issues for participants in the U.S., said Sutherland, who assisted in writing the letter.      The metaphors individuals use to explain staking might be misleading in a harmful way, he said, although the implications might not be immediately obvious.      “The example here is it's misleading to say that validators get paid to create blocks and to maintain the network,” he said. “And it might seem harmless but this metaphor can lead to the idea that block rewards are income, and of course income gets taxed.”      These implications are starting to be felt by the industry.      If an individual staker has seen the number of tokens they hold grow by 6%, this does not mean the staker has a 6% gain if, for example, the number of tokens on the network as a whole has increased by 5%, he said.      Read more: Industry Group Led by Polychain, Coinbase Seeks to Get Ahead on Staking Regulations      The IRS has yet to say how or when staking rewards should be taxed, said Shehan Chandrasekera, Cointracker head of tax strategy. In an email, he said there are a few different positions as to how staking rewards can be taxed.      “Technically speaking, staking income is similar to rental income. This is because cryptocurrencies are treated as property. Income you get after lending property is rental income by default,” he said.      However, staking income can also be treated as interest because rewards might look like interest payments (though he said it would have to be fiat money to comply with case law).    Property    Sutherland said the appropriate approach to taxing staking rewards could be to treat it like new property.      New property isn’t taxed as income right away, he said, but taxed when it’s sold.      The congressmen agreed in their letter.      “Those who help validate transactions create new blocks in the cryptocurrency blockchain and also create these new tokens. Similar to all other forms of taxpayer-created (or taxpayer-discovered) property – such as crops, mineral, livestock, artworks and even widgets off the assembly line – these tokens could be taxed when they are sold,” the letter said.      Read more: IRS Violated ‘Taxpayer Bill of Rights’ With 2019 Crypto Letters: Watchdog      Chandrasekera said there is an argument to be made in support of this method, though in his view the “most conservative approach” would be to tax rewards as income at the time they’re received, which is similar to how the IRS approaches mining rewards.      Sutherland said he believes the issue is less important for mining than it is for staking because it’s more likely token rewards are more diluted in a proof-of-stake network. Still, Wednesday’s letter is mainly a first step in getting clarification on how tokens are treated by the nation’s Tax Man..      As part of that, Sutherland hopes the crypto industry gets better at using metaphors in explaining how new consensus mechanisms or token reward systems work.      “Block rewards are not a money machine,” he said.

42384368,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWr9H,1596560403,Decentralized Exchange dYdX Debuts Ether Perpetual Swaps,"Perpetual swaps that track the price of ether (ETH) are coming to dYdX, the company announced Tuesday.      ""The main reason people like trading these contracts is because people can trade them with pretty high leverage,"" dYdX founder Antonio Juliano told CoinDesk in a phone call.      The decentralized finance (DeFi) firm was founded three years ago to contribute to the stack of financial products available in the crypto industry. It started with enabling margin trading on Ethereum and has now expanded to providing synthetic assets that enable traders to make bigger bets. This follows its launch of bitcoin perpetual swaps in April.      Read more: Popular BTC Derivatives Product Goes Live on DeFi’s dYdX      ""The types of people who trade derivatives are really institutions and some sophisticated retail-type traders,"" Juliano explained. ""It basically helps people to express more complicated opinions on price, and this really helps to stabilize the underlying markets.""      As an example, with swaps, if people in the market see something they see as very unhealthy for ETH's price, they can go onto dYdX and take out a 10x short position against the price of ETH, planning to profit $10 for ever $1 ETH's price falls. This is a very dangerous play, because if the price goes up instead they lose $10 for every $1 it rises.      Such a position can very quickly eat all the trader's collateral.      However, precisely because of that, it sends a strong signal to the market. If one trader takes that kind of position others will start looking to see if they should be scared, too. Obviously if someone sells their ETH that sends a signal to the market as well, but it's a less weighty signal than a leveraged short position.      So theoretically, as the derivatives market gets bigger and more sophisticated it should help ETH itself become less volatile, as warnings come in earlier and sound more loudly.      ""We're not there yet,"" Juliano cautioned. ""With the rise of more derivatives products it should help.""    How it works    A leveraged derivative allows traders to magnify gains and losses on an asset without anyone involved holding the asset itself.      Popularized on the centralized exchange BitMEX, perpetual swaps are unique to the crypto market. They create a synthetic asset that, when working properly, roughly tracks the price of the underlying asset, while allowing more leverage. Market makers in the system make it feasible for traders to find buyers for their positions.      Read more: FTX Releases COMP Derivatives to Keep Up With DeFi Frenzy      A user's losses are limited by the collateral they put up to back their bet. So if a user took a leveraged bet against the price of ETH, but the ETH price rose, they would get liquidated once their losses started approaching their total collateral. So for example, $300 ETH in collateral would only tolerate a bit less than $300 ETH in losses before the collateral was sold to cover the loss.      Juliano argued that dYdX's product enables more leverage more easily than other DeFi alternatives, such as using Instadapp to take out multiple loans at once on Compound. Its users also won't pay gas though they will pay trading fees.      Juliano said that trades on dYdX are among the largest for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), at around $10,000 on average.      In the traditional market, any derivatives market always dwarfs the underlying market it tracks, and Juliano noted that we're starting to see that in crypto over the last year, with derivatives markets outpacing the spot market for the first time. However, in traditional finance, perpetual markets don't exist. Derivatives usually come with an expiration date.      Juliano said he believes this is because there are so many traders who want to be able to magnify their bets with a product that's roughly as simple to trade as the underlying asset.

42384350,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWr2z,1596559162,There’s Now an Accelerator Exclusively for DeFi Startups,"The Chicago DeFi Alliance (CDA), which includes fintech firms Jump Trading, Cumberland DRW, CMT Digital, Volt Capital and others, is launching one of the first accelerator programs devoted entirely to decentralized finance (DeFi) startups beginning in August.    Volt Capital co-founder Imran Khan and CDA partner Qiao Wang will lead the eight-week program for early-stage startups, plus a fast-track program to introduce more established startups to relevant experts.  Modeled after Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator program, the program will invest $120,000 in each participating team for future token purchases. Khan said the investment would be in “tokens at either seed or [a] discount” on what is already being traded publicly.  There will be two accelerator batches in 2020, he said. Khan said CDA has received over 100 applications for the new accelerator and will choose seven startups for the first group.  “Fees are high. Liquidity is low. [User interface] is messy. Settlement is slow. Everything feels like a toy. But history is full of examples of hugely successful technologies that started out looking like toys,” Wang said. “DeFi has all the fundamental qualities to become a real, trusted alternative to the legacy financial system.”  In addition to the accelerator program, Khan said several new members joined the CDA, including Alameda Research, FTX, Electric Capital, Dragonfly Capital, Hashed and Delphi Digital.

42384390,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWrD3,1596557100,"Blockchain Bites: XRP Sales, INX IPO and Bitcoin Mining Woes","China's bitcoin miners are in a rut, Ripple shows signs of sales growth and INX is continuing with its IPO vision.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Flooded Market China’s severe flooding, the worst in decades, hasn’t overwhelmingly impacted the bitcoin mining industry – but it’s still a difficult rainy season. Johnson Xu, chief analyst at Beijing-based research startup TokenInsight, said most mining facilities have chosen spots outside of flood plains. However, factors like bitcoin’s increased hashrate, lower price and the oversupply of bitcoin miners in the region have led to a daily revenue drop of 70% compared to last year. China’s bitcoin miner operations account for 65% of the global multi-billion dollar industry.      XRP Report Ripple said it sold $32.55 million of its XRP cryptocurrency during Q2 2020, a 1,760% jump over Q1’s sales figures and the first signs of XRP sales growth in nearly a year. According to its most recent quarterly report, over-the-counter (OTC) XRP sales surged, spurred in part by liquidity-providing integrations with telco Swisscom Blockchain, swap execution facility Zero Hash and the crypto bank Sygnum. Average daily volume slumped to 196 million from Q1’s 322 million. Ripple’s programmatic sales program – made directly to exchanges – is still on pause.      Back Backed Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Blockstream CEO Adam Back participated in a $3.1 million private security token offering (STO) for the online strategy game “Infinite Fleet.” The game is ​developed by Pixelmatic, founded by Samson Mow, who is also CSO at Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream. Announced Friday, the round was broken into two parts, with $2.75 million raised via Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs) and $250,000 raised through the investment platform BnkToTheFuture.      Yuan Over Yon? Digital currency should replace fiat in China's financial systems, according to a former vice president at Bank of China, one of the nation's four biggest state-owned commercial banks. The executive, Yongli Wang, said over WeChat that wide use of digital currencies would encourage monetary reform, bolster liquidity and place limits on excessive cash issuance. Wang, now a director of the Haixia Blockchain Research Institute, also said limiting digital currency as a replacement for cash could impact its market competitiveness. China is in the process of developing and testing a digital yuan through its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DC/EP) system.      SegWit Sleuths NetWalker ransomware, which last week triggered cybersecurity flash warnings from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), has extorted $25 million in bitcoin from its corporate and governmental victims during the months of the pandemic, according to a report by McAfee and CipherTrace. NetWalker is a “ransomware-as-a-service” that gains its access through COVID-19 phishing emails, steals internal documents and demands a payout. Approximately 2,795 bitcoins have been transferred to NetWalker wallet addresses beginning March 1, with evidence showing hackers are swapping this extorted payout into cold storage and SegWit addresses, possibly to reduce fees.

(The Block)  Coin Center CEO Jerry Brito builds anonymous forum for free speech. (Decrypt)  Bitfinex offers “up to” $400 million reward for bitcoins stolen during 2016 exchange hack. (The Block)  At stake    Cryptocurrency and security token exchange INX is continuing with its plans to go public – as one of the largest offerings (within the digital assets industry) to date.      According to an updated F-1 Form (the Securities and Exchange Commission prospectus form for foreign issuers), the Gibraltar-based firm is looking to raise a maximum of $117 million. If successful, that would be $27 million more than mining giant Canaan made when it went public in 2019, CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports.      Initial public offerings are rare in the industry, but becoming more common. Silvergate Bank and Argo Mining, among others, led the way with others soon to follow. Both Coinbase and Diginex are expected to appear on Nasdaq – through unconventional channels.  INX’s plan is also unconventional, with the raise being led through a token sale. The firm will offer 130 million INX tokens at $0.90 each, with investors able to purchase INX tokens with USDC, bitcoin and ether – under certain restrictions – as well as the U.S. dollar. The token is used to pay transaction fees on the platform.      In years prior, token sales were largely unregistered initial coin offerings, which led to a slew of problems still being meted out. Chief among them, the debate over whether token holders have rights over a company or protocol.      While INX holders won’t be equity holders, they will receive a share of the firm’s profits. Further, in the advent of a liquidation, token holders will be paid ahead of shareholders.      While going public isn’t an option for the majority of crypto firms, this arrangement shows a new path forward for crypto’s integration with the larger financial system. The ability to use cryptographically secure tokens to confer benefits to stakeholders, while also providing benefit to the platform.      INX's executive managing director, Alan Silbert, is the brother of Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.      As the filing shows, INX plans to use the IPO funds to build its digital platform.      UPDATE: (August 14, 16:30 UTC): This section has been updated to show the IPO target has not been lowered, as originally reported.    Market intel    Institutional Interest Open interest, or open positions, in bitcoin futures listed on major exchanges reached a new lifetime high of $5.6 billion on Saturday, surpassing the previous record of $5.36 billion in February, according to data source Skew. “The rise in open interest represents an accumulation of long positions by institutional traders,” said Matthew Dibb, COO of Stack. Open interest in futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) jumped to a record high of $828 million on Monday, surging 127% over the past 2.5 weeks alongside bitcoin's quick rise from $9,100 to $11,100.      Ethereum 2.0: How It Work and Why It Matters CoinDesk Research's 22-page report covers the long-awaited Ethereum 2.0, from its technology and development road map to potential market impact as the foundational upgrade to the world's largest smart contract platform. Ethereum developers present commentary about the benefits and risks this new technology may bring. Download the free report.    Opinion    Taking the Economy Back From Economists Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham University in New York, is best known for her attempts to enter New York politics as a progressive advocate. She recently published, “BREAK ‘EM UP: Recovering Our Freedom from Big Ag, Big Tech, and Big Money,” about the monopolization of American industry and the antitrust actions being pursued. What follows is an abridged conversation with Teachout and CoinDesk privacy reporter Ben Powers. Read the full Q&A here.      How do monopolistic companies create parallel government structures?      There are clearly forms of private government that are smuggled inside our current public government and growing in power. If you ask somebody who is an Amazon seller what judicial system they care about, they care a lot about Amazon’s system and their own mechanisms for delisting sellers. These companies have their own intellectual property regime, their own punishment regime, and that is as important if not more so than the public one if you are caught within the web of one of these private, growing governments.      You bring up decentralization a lot in the book. How might cryptocurrencies play a role in that?      I think of these systems as incredibly important, but it all depends on what the governance mechanism is. When Amazon recently applied for a patent to use blockchain technology, which would basically require every seller to keep a ledger of where all their supplies come from, then basically the technology itself isn’t doing a lot of decentralization. The technology is in service of a centralized power. There is no such thing as no-governance regimes. When I talk to crypto advocates, they’ll often frame it as if it is a world with no governance. But there is never an absence of governance. In the end, someone controls supply. Technology itself can’t do quite as much work as I think some of the advocates think. But again, let’s have that discussion, because I think there’s just unbelievably powerful ways in which it can be used for the good.      You talk about developing a “f–k-off” economy. What do you mean by that?      I’m trying to take the economy back from the economists. They’ve been acting like priests for 40 years and telling us that we, as mere residents of this society, have no business messing with economic terms like monopoly or antitrust, and we should just trust their assessments of efficiency. When you take the economy back for people and not economists, then things like wages matter again.

Over 1.1 million data points were stolen and put on sale for $1.50 each on the online forums, the Russian newspaper Kommersant wrote. The data, consisting exclusively of passport numbers, has little value on its own, the anonymous sellers admitted to Kommersant. But such data can be used for phishing attacks when combined with information from other leaked databases.      Moscow's Department of Information Technologies, which is responsible for the design of the voting system, denied the report in an email to CoinDesk.      ""The department is regularly monitoring the internet for publications of such data, including the darknet. The database mentioned in the publication has nothing to do with the list of voters who registered to vote online,"" the department's press office wrote, adding that the information on the Moscow city hall's servers was properly protected and ""there had been no leaks since the beginning of 2020.""      See also: Putin Signs Russian Crypto Bill Into Law      The online voting was a part of nationwide voting dedicated to the amendments to the Russian constitution, which, among other things, eliminated the two-term restriction for presidents, effectively allowing Vladimir Putin to stay in power longer.      The online voting system, based on Bitfury's open-source Exonum blockchain and built with the help of Kaspersky Lab, was previously reported to have poor data protection. Journalists were able to decrypt people's votes as well as pull passport numbers out of a weakly protected file posted online by the authorities, a Russian media outlet Meduza wrote.      The voting took part during the last week of June and ended July 1, both online and at the physical polling stations. Municipal authorities' employees were forced to vote electronically, BBC reported.      In a blog post earlier Tuesday, department representative Artyom Kostyrko said the department compared the screenshot the seller provided with the voter database, and the information didn't check out. However, according to the founder of the cybersecurity firm DeviceLock, Ashot Oganesyan, the database was genuine and has been on sale for a while now.

Medalla is the final testnet before the launch of the Eth 2.0 network, which is tentatively expected by year’s end.  The correct number of peers joined the tesnet to consider it workable, according to a tweet from the Ethereum Foundation’s Hudson Jameson.  As reported by CoinDesk, Medalla was one of many Eth 2.0 testnets over 2019 and 2020. Unlike the other testnets, however, Medalla was public – meaning network validators were not centrally coordinated by developer teams.  Over 20,000 validators have joined the network with some 650,000 ether (ETH) staked, according to the Beaconcha.in block explorer. (Each testnet uses its own tokens not equivalent to real ETH.)  Medalla was joined by five clients including Prysmatic Labs’ Prysm, ChainSafe’s Lodestar, PegaSys’ Teku, Status’ Nimbus and Sigma Prime’s Lighthouse.  Eth 2.0 encapsulates years of research to switch the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) Ethereum network to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.

42384341,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWr0T,1596546015,Genesis' Crypto Lending Rebounds in 2Q; Firm Acknowledges Unsecured Loans,"Genesis Capital’s lending portfolio rapidly recovered in the second quarter after a sharp decline that resulted from the mid-March bitcoin (BTC) sell-off.      The cryptocurrency lender’s book of active trading loans increased 118% from the end of the first quarter to $1.4 billion at mid-year, the firm disclosed Tuesday. The blistering pace of growth was likely an anomaly, the company said.      “The 100% growth rate in our loans is a function of the fact that we cut our data set at about March 31,” Genesis CEO Michael Moro said in an interview. “To think that our loans outstanding would grow by over 100% in just three months going forward is probably unrealistic.”      The business took a hit when bitcoin, along with the mainstream financial markets, tumbled on coronavirus fears late in the first quarter. The fast comeback signals that crypto borrowing remains a popular tool for arbitrage among professional traders. They typically borrow fiat and put up crypto as collateral, or vice versa, or pledge one crypto asset as security for another.      Genesis Capital is the lending arm of Genesis Trading, itself a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), which is also the parent company of CoinDesk.    Unsecured loans    Market chatter recently has focused on lending practices of the leading firms in the niche. As CoinDesk reported last week, Genesis’ rival Celsius Network has been quietly making at least some unsecured loans (despite its CEO’s public boasts that it demands collateral); investing a portion of depositors’ funds in derivative contracts, rather than in loans; and rehypothecating (i.e. lending out) collateral pledged by borrowers. All else equal, such practices increase risk compared to an always-collateralized, lending-only, collateral-retained model.      Genesis claims the interest it collects from borrowers entirely funds the interest it pays its lenders. Moro would not say whether it rehypothecates collateral. Genesis’ vice president of lending, Matt Ballensweig, said the firm makes some uncollateralized loans to “strategic partners,” but would not say how big a percentage of its loan volume was unsecured.      See also: Banks Won’t Rush to Hold Crypto – But OCC’s Regulatory Approval Makes It Harder to Ignore      The clients who are lending their assets out through Genesis are high-net-worth individuals, hedge funds, and other asset managers, and they generate returns of 6% to 12% on those loans.      Firms that borrow from Genesis are hedge funds, quantitative trading firms, crypto exchanges, other crypto lenders, and crypto operating companies such as bitcoin ATM firms.    Re-mix    The lender is still seeing a flight away from U.S. dollar loans to bitcoin loans. Dollars loans made up 32% of the loan book, down from nearly 36.6% the previous quarter, and bitcoin’s share increased to 51.2%. The second-largest cryptocurrency represented in the loan book is ether (ETH), making up 7.4%.      Most of Genesis' lending is directly affected by the spread between bitcoin's spot and futures prices, Moro said. For example, a trader might borrow dollars to buy a futures contract as its premium over bitcoin’s spot price continues to rise.      But a period of low volatility in the spot price dampened interest in dollar loans that would normally be used for this kind of arbitrage, Moro said. Now, instead of borrowing greenbacks, traders are borrowing bitcoin to sell it short while going long futures in a crypto version of the classic Wall Street steepening curve strategy, said Ballensweig.      Ballensweig said he expects this dynamic to change in the third quarter as traders look to unwind futures trades. “Back in Q2 the traders were actually hoping for that premium to expand,” he said. “Now they’re saying, 'okay, let’s take some of those profits and actually short the curve.'”    Trading holds steady    Despite decreased volatility in the spot market, Genesis’ trading volume increased by $1.25 billion to $5.25 billion in the second quarter. The majority of the trading volume was on over-the-counter trading desks with the rest being on exchanges.      With its new derivatives trading desk introduced in May, the firm traded $400 million across forwards and options with nearly 50 active counterparties across 10 different assets. Around 67% of the trading volume was executed bilaterally while the remaining 33% was executed on exchanges. Roughly 80% of the volume has been concentrated in BTC to U.S. dollar trades, with ETH to USD trades and other major tokens making up the rest.

42384349,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWr81,1596546000,What People Who Aren’t Bullish on Bitcoin Still Like About It,"In this audio interview, CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen and researcher Nadia Eghbal, author of the upcoming book “Working in Public,” talk about open-source software projects. From platforms like Github to software languages like Rust, Cuen and Eghbal explore what the open source movement looks like in 2020.

This episode is sponsored by Crypto.com, Bitstamp and Nexo.io.      There are people who understand bitcoin yet aren’t obsessively bullish on it. (I know, it’s weird. Like, how?)      Eghbal, a Protocol Labs alum who is familiar with bitcoin, is among them. She described bitcoin as a rare example of a project growing throughout a decade and continuing. Many people measure growth in terms of unique contributors, users or profits. For Eghbal, looking at different types of “activity” might offer a better spectrum.      “Measuring activity is maybe a better way to think about project health ... some projects also don’t need to be as actively developed as others,” Eghbal said. “I was also looking at things like maintainers’ responsiveness.”      In short, are problems promptly fixed before they affect users? The quality of contributions should be evaluated in addition to the sheer number of contributors. Do the people who use the software get unique value from it when they need it?      Another useful metric, she said, can be “work done,” including “how many pull requests are being merged or how many issues are being closed.”      And, luckily, Eghbal isn’t the only researcher who understands bitcoin without being “active” in the “Bitcoin community.” (To be fair, I use these silly words more than anyone.) Privacy tech legend Claudia Diaz, Nym’s chief technologist, said she believes there could be value in cryptocurrency projects, although that’s not her focus nor passion.      “Cryptocurrency offers an option for the people who use the systems to fund them,” Diaz said. “I’m interested in making systems that make sense and self-sustain because everyone has the right incentives.”    Incentives    There are many different types of value people derive from open-source software projects.      Sometimes they use the software, sometimes they use public work to develop their own personal brand. Eghbal said some of the most widely sought after engineers are “building an active fanbase for whatever they are creating.”      She added there are “different types of open-source projects” with passionate fandoms, like Rust, plus open source developers have “a lot in common” with other types of online content creators. These public displays can lead to dramatic Twitter feuds and heated rivalries, just like other personality-driven roles like TikTok stars and podcasters.      “I’ve been told so many things are definitely, absolutely true, yet are all conflicting with each other,” Eghbal said of her research. “If I’ve learned anything it’s that developers have opinions.”      This is why Diaz’s token-funded startup, Nym, is developing a privacy layer comparable to Tor, the latter of which she said is heavily reliant on government funding. In contrast, her startup Nym raised $2.5 million in a private token sale in 2019.      “Tor offers different trade-offs,” Diaz said. “We built Nym and the applications on top can be messaging applications or cryptocurrency applications ... using the infrastructure to protect their metadata in the sense the network can’t figure out what services you are accessing or what they might be doing with those services.”    Open Source Motivations    Diaz considers herself somewhat of an outsider to the open-source developer community, like Eghbal. Their motivations are primarily research-oriented, because research is their job.      Nym co-founders like Harry Halpin have more experience in (ideological) open source software development. Even coming from different perspectives, Halpin, Diaz and Eghbal all agreed that collaboration and interdependence are the crux of the open source development process.      “Now instead of relying on a couple of other developers’ code you may now be relying on hundreds of thousands of people’s projects and you don’t even know who these people are,” Eghbal said.      As such, Halpin said Nym works closely with teams contributing to other open-source projects, like Rust, Cosmos and Zcash. In addition, his team often works with independent (quasi-celebrity) developers like Amir Taaki. Sometimes people contribute as a hobbyist or a user with specific needs, other times they are paid. There are many reasons why people work on cryptocurrency projects.      “I think it would be great to have an infrastructure that could support privacy in a variety of applications,” Diaz said. “Cryptocurrency offers an option for the people who use the systems to fund them ... Privacy technologies have been very difficult to market.”      On the other hand, Eghbal described bitcoin as moving more slowly than some other cryptocurrency projects.      “Trying to prioritize stability is a very different development style rather than allowing people to have lots and lots of features,” Eghbal said, describing Bitcoin as relatively “stable.”      And even if the price of the asset never goes “to the moon,” perhaps continuing to provide reliable software tools can be a metric of success in itself.

42384356,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWrFZ,1596545793,"First Mover: As Fed Nears Inflation Rubicon, Analysts See $50K Bitcoin in Play","The Federal Reserve appears ready to pursue yet another untested strategy that could ultimately boost inflation – and possibly prices for bitcoin.      The Fed is ""preparing to effectively abandon its strategy of pre-emptively lifting interest rates to head off higher inflation,"" according to a new report in the Wall Street Journal.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The shift signals an explicit willingness by the central bank to tolerate higher inflation, at a time when the spreading coronavirus continues to ravage the economy. The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 11%, a level not witnessed since the early 1940s until this year.      The Fed's extra loosening of monetary policy could help support prices for bitcoin, which many cryptocurrency investors speculate could serve as an effective hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Bitcoin prices have already soared 58% this year, beating silver's 36% and gold's 30%, not to mention the 2% gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large stocks.      Bitcoin rose 1.5% on Monday to $11,338.      ""As more investors look to 'digital gold' as an inflation hedge in an increasingly digitized world amidst unprecedented government money printing,"" the cryptocurrency research firm Messari wrote Monday, ""we know that it won’t take much of an institutional allocation until $50,000 bitcoin is back on the table.""      The Fed already has taken monetary policy to a new level of extraordinary this year, pumping nearly $3 trillion of freshly created money into financial markets earlier and pushing its total assets to about $7 trillion. A growing number of investors in both digital-asset and traditional markets say the flood of dollars could whittle down the U.S. currency's purchasing power.      The dollar index, a gauge of the the currency's strength in foreign exchange markets, fell 4% in July, the biggest monthly drop since 2010. And the Wall Street brokerage firm Jefferies now predicts that the dollar could fall as much as 15%, according to CNBC.      Bank of America analysts wrote Monday in a report that it's becoming a popular trade to bet against the dollar, since investors are ""worried about the long-term impact of the rapid accumulation of U.S. debt for the U.S. dollar's reserve-currency status.""      ""As gold, silver, equities, and long bonds reach record high levels, and the U.S. dollar slumps, the king of cryptocurrencies may be back in the spotlight for the foreseeable future,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the cryptocurrency-focused firm Arca, wrote Monday in a weekly blog.      Under the Fed's policy shift, according to the Wall Street Journal, the central bank would allow inflation to drift above a 2% target before raising rates. The idea is that above-target inflation would offset periods where consumer price increases were previously below the mark, as has been the case for most of the past two decades.      The goal is not to increase inflation per se, but to provide assurances to investors that interest rates would remain low for a long time, according to the paper. Such accommodation could help to assure a faster economic recovery.      Yet, higher inflation could further distort already uncanny signals emanating from bond markets, further undermining the dollar's attractiveness. Nominal yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds are currently around 0.6%, close to historic lows. Once inflation is factored in, the ""real yields"" equate to negative 1%.      Assuming nominal yields don't rise much anytime soon, an inflation rate above 2% would cause bond investors to fall even further behind.      ""Negative real rates imply a loss in purchasing power from holding U.S. Treasuries, the ideal conditions for non-income producing assets such as gold and silver but also crypto assets like bitcoin,"" the analysis firm Delphi Digital wrote on July 31.      There's some risk that a fresh panic in markets might prompt investors to rush back into dollars, which could mean a redux of the March crash in bitcoin prices.      But according to an Aug. 2 Bloomberg News story, the next ""risk-off scenario"" might not see investors rushing into dollars, due to the ""flood of liquidity unleashed by the Fed.""      ""Any haven rally is likely to be shallower than in previous years,"" according to the report, ""while the possible extent of depreciation remains the same.""      ""Everything hinges on the dollar right now,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency-focused research firm Quantum Economics, wrote Monday in an email to subscribers.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $11,186 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,480 | 24-Hr Low: $11,164      Trend: Bitcoin is again struggling to find a foothold above $11,400 amid signs of buyer exhaustion on the three-day chart.      The number one cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $11,290, having hit a high of $11,424 during the Asian trading hours. Tuesday is the second straight day of bull failure above $11,400. Prices hit a high of $11,480 on Monday, but printed a UTC close below $11,240.      Essentially, bitcoin’s recovery rally from Sunday’s “flash crash” low of $10,659 has stalled with the area above $11,400 acting as stiff resistance.      The bulls need quick progress now, or the focus would shift to the uptrend exhaustion signaled by a major doji candle seen on the three-day chart.      A doji occurs when prices see two-way business during a specific period. While it is usually considered a sign of indecision, in this case, it has appeared following a notable rally to 11-month highs above $12,100. As such, it represents buyer fatigue.      The three-day chart's relative strength index (RSI) is also reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 reading. Thus, a pullback to $11,000 can't be ruled out. A move below that psychological support would expose the former hurdle-turned-support at $10,500 (February high).

42384343,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWr1j,1596544278,INX Scales Down US IPO Target to $117M – Still Set to Be Crypto’s Largest,"Cryptocurrency and security token exchange INX has shifted its sights for a planned initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S.      The Gibraltar-based trading group filed an F-1 Form – a securities registration for non-U.S. issuers – with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday. Originally slated for Q2 2020, the sale is now expected to take place before the end of the year, according to the revised prospectus.      Per the filing, INX has priced 130 million INX tokens at $0.90 each, putting the maximum raise at $117 million, which could make it the largest IPO in the digital asset industry to date. That's in the middle of the target range given in the previous prospectus, filed in March, when the company hoped to sell the shares at $0.80 to $1.00 apiece, raising up to $130 million.      The maximum target, if achieved, would still be $27 million more than mining chip manufacturer Canaan raised in November 2019.      Investors will be able to purchase INX tokens with cryptocurrencies as well as the U.S. dollar. INX will accept commits made in the stablecoin USDC, bitcoin and ether – but only if the sale exceeds the minimum $7.5 million raise amount.      Although it won't be the first IPO to accept cryptocurrencies, it will be the largest offering yet to do so.      INX is a cryptocurrency and security token exchange hopeful that seeks to operate in the U.S. It's been trying to register with the SEC for more than two years so it can offer a regulatory-compliant sale and first registered with the chief securities watchdog last summer.      The firm's executive managing director, Alan Silbert, is the brother of Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.      A series of other crypto companies are making plans to become publicly tradeable. Last week, a Hong Kong-based crypto derivatives exchange said it would begin trading on the Nasdaq via a reverse listing in Q3. Coinbase is said to be considering a direct listing in the U.S. next year.      See also: $14M Bitcoin Fund Gets Listed on Toronto Stock Exchange      With INX being an ERC-20 token, investors will need an Ethereum wallet address to participate in the sale. The exchange said in the latest filing it will not send tokens to Ethereum wallets based on the platforms of possible rival exchanges, including Coinbase. Bitrexx, Jaxx, Poloniex, Kraken, Bitfinex, Cex.io, Bitstamp and others are also excluded.      INX tokens can be used against transaction fees and confer holders the right to receive 40% of cumulative net cash flow on an annual basis once the platform makes more than it spends. Tokens don't confer ownership of the company themselves.      However, token holders may be unlikely to earn much in the first year. In the filing, INX says it hasn't actually made any revenue since its 2017 launch and made a $3.7 million loss in 2019.      Indeed, the IPO funds will actually go towards launching the digital trading platform that INX says will mean it can finally earn revenue. It estimates the platform could launch within 12 months of the minimum raise being reached.      See also: First Mover: Crypto’s $35T Moment Could Come From Analog-World Stock Listings      Passing the minimum raise will allow INX to further develop the platform, develop a new Cash Fund that can be used to cover both company and customer losses, and apply for a U.S. broker-dealer license. The company can already operate as a money transmitter in seven U.S. states, including California.      The prospectus highlights that INX has received support from high-profile industry figures. Riccardo Spagni, Monero's former lead maintainer and public face, owns 7.5% of the company (just under a million dollars' worth) and Litecoin creator Charlie Lee owns $100,000 worth of ordinary INX shares.      INX said in its previous prospectus it would apply for a New York BitLicense, although this isn't explicitly mentioned in Monday's filing. The company still plans to move its headquarters from Gibraltar to New York at a future, undisclosed date.

42384327,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWnDD,1596543645,Bitcoin Futures Interest Soars as Bond Yields Fall to Record Lows: Industry Exec,"Bitcoin futures are drawing record interest as investment opportunities in traditional markets dry up, said the co-founder of an institutional fund provider.    Open interest, or open positions, in futures listed on major exchanges reached a new lifetime high of $5.6 billion on Saturday, surpassing the previous record of $5.36 billion in February, according to data source Skew.  As of Monday, aggregate open interest was $5 billion, up 66% from the July low of $3 billion.  Open interest in futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), synonymous with institutional investors, jumped to a record high of $828 million on Monday.  CME's open interest has surged 127% over the past 2.5 weeks alongside bitcoin's quick rise from $9,100 to $11,100.  “The rise in open interest represents an accumulation of long positions by institutional traders,” said Matthew Dibb, the co-founder and COO of Stack, an institutional provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.  Dibb said the rise in open interest in crypto derivatives suggests investors are looking for alpha – the best returns – in alternative markets as equities look overbought and bond yields move into negative territory.  The U.S. 10-year Treasury note is offering a yield of 0.54% at press time with the real or inflation-adjusted bill at a record low of -1%.  Similar bonds in Germany, Japan and Switzerland are offering negative yields, according to TradingView data.  As a potential macro hedge, Dibb expects bitcoin to break into multi-year highs as the global economy worsens and investors become steadily confident in moving value from traditional markets into the digital asset space.  Bitcoin's price is largely unchanged at $11,290; technical bias remains bullish with prices holding well above the support line at $10,500, the February high.

Yongli Wang, previously of the Bank of China, said in a WeChat post that wide use of digital currencies would encourage monetary reform, as reported by media outlet The Global Times on Sunday.  Wang, now a director of the Haixia Blockchain Research Institute, also said China would use digital currency as a substitute for cash in circulation initially, but that could impact its market competitiveness if confined solely to that role.  Digital currencies, he said, could help to bolster liquidity in an economy, while placing limits on excessive issuance of physical cash.  Wang added that preventing the printing of too much cash would help maintain monetary and financial stability.  One way forward, he suggested, would be to provide exclusive ""basic accounts"" on the central bank's digital currency platform for all social entities, according to the report.  Bank of China is one of the nation's four biggest state-owned commercial banks.  The former VP's comments come at a time when China's biggest banks and other commercial entities have begun trialing the pilot of the central bank's Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DC/EP) system.

Users can also hedge on positions of debt taken up on lending protocols in the DeFi space.  The company believes options are a ""necessary building block"" for the maturation of DeFi, according to a blog post.  Talking of why his firm co-led the round, NGC Managing Partner Roger Lim said Hedget would help solve the ""pain points"" of costly and slow settlements for decentralized options trading.  The derivatives startup was incubated by Chromia, a scalable blockchain platform designed to support decentralized applications, or dapps.  Chromia also invested in the seed round, its co-founder, Or Perelman, told CoinDesk.  With fees on Ethereum now proving ""prohibitively"" expensive, Perelman said Hedget is further utilizing Chromia as a layer-two solution over Ethereum for complex trading transactions, with only settlements being recorded on Ethereum.  He added Hedget's seed investment was significantly oversubscribed, but the team had decided to go for ""an average number.""

In a report from the Moscow Times on Monday citing AFP, Vinnik's lawyer and others said he will face charges of defrauding more than 100 people in six French cities from 2016 to 2018.  Vinnik will also face charges of extortion, aggravated money laundering, conspiracy and harming automatic data-processing systems as the head of the now-shuttered crypto exchange BTC-e, an AFP source said.  Billions of dollars' worth of bitcoin passed through BTC-e , some of which was allegedly used to launder money for criminals.  Law enforcement agencies moved to halt operations of the exchange in 2017.  Later the same year, Vinnik was detained by authorities in Greece and became the focus of a legal tug-of-war involving the governments of Russia, the U.S. and France, all of which were seeking his extradition.  On the day Vinnik arrived in France in late January he was immediately charged and prosecutors filed to launch the trial late last month.  The suspect, who maintains his innocence, had hoped to be extradited to Russia, where he would face less severe fraud charges for the amount of €9,500 ($11,200).

42384312,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAWn1t,1596528000,The 2020 Rainy Season Is Tougher Than Ever for China’s Bitcoin Miners,"The rain has come. The machines are humming. This should be the best time of the year for China’s bitcoin miners. The monsoon season, generally from June to October, brings excessive rain and thus cheap hydro electricity.      But this year is different, proving to be harder than ever for China's bitcoin miners and mining farm operators who are estimated to dominate 65% of the global multi-billion dollar bitcoin mining industry.      Since last summer, many mining farm operators rushed to build new facilities in China’s southwestern region in anticipation of a dramatic price rise with bitcoin’s halving.      But mining difficulty has now almost doubled compared to the monsoon season last year, while block rewards have halved, meaning it is more difficult to mine, with less rewards. Bitcoin miners that have entered the market since last year have to wait much longer to see a return on their investment in mining hardware and facilities.      Thomas Heller, global business director of mining pool F2Pool, summarized the situation in a recent blog post: “We’re halfway through 2020 and the mining industry has already faced several enormous challenges.”      “Miners had to battle off the macroeconomic black swan of March, pass through the smoke of the halving and a pandemic, and now they’re gearing up for the rest of the year’s competitive battlefield,” he wrote.    A year with a bitcoin halving and global epidemic rolled into one, it’s truly one of a kind.    Read more:Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sets New Record High 2 Months After Halving    Harder than ever    Many miners expected bitcoin’s price to rise sharply after the halving, said Kevin Pan, CEO and co-founder of the China-based PoolIn, one of the two biggest bitcoin mining pools in the world (along with F2Pool).      “In reality, not only there was not much price momentum driven by halving, there came the mega sell-off on March 12, which caused a large scale of forced liquidation and loss,” he said.      For two months after halving, bitcoin’s price largely remained static around $9,000. Although it jumped above $10,000 last week and is now changing hands over $11,000, it is still at a similar price level seen at this time last year.      In contrast, the network’s mining difficulty rose to an all-time-level within two months after halving. It’s now almost twice as difficult to mine bitcoin compared to last July, while block rewards have halved.      Without a significant price breakout, bitcoin miner’s daily revenue has dropped by 70% compared to last year, said Pan, although the recent bitcoin price jump has helped improving the situation.      Indeed, Bitinfochart’s data shows bitcoin’s daily mining revenue was around $0.33 per one terahashes second (TH/s) of computing power in July 2019. It has since then declined to now around $0.1 per TH/s.    Overcapacity    Meanwhile, a surge in interest and investment in bitcoin mining since last year have led to a surplus of newly constructed mining facilities in China.      In April, the oversupply issue had already shifted the hosting business from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market, with mining farms generally offering a 20% electricity discount compared to last year.      Pan estimates that during this rainy season, 20% to 30% of mining facility capacity in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces still remains unused.      Read more:China’s Rainy Season Is Coming. This Time Bitcoin Miners Aren’t Investing      To be clear, bitcoin miners and mining farms can still make a profit. But they have to endure a much longer period than expected to break even on their investments.      A payback period of six months to a year used to be common for bitcoin miners in China, but if bitcoin maintains its current prices around $11,000, that could be extended to as long as two years.      “In the eyes of many old Chinese miners, the electricity price right now is not only lower than the similar situation of the halving and hydro season in 2016, but also even lower than the electricity prices during the 2015 bear market,” said Heller of F2Pool.      Lower electricity may be appealing to miners, but it also means mining farm operators are facing an “unprecedented investment challenge” as the business shifted to a buyer’s market, Heller said.    Long-term bullish    Despite this year’s tough market environment, some are still bullish over the long term and are rolling out products to attract investors. Jiang Zhuo'er, CEO and founder of mining pool BTC.Top who also runs his own mining farms, recently launched joint-mining contracts dubbed B.top.      It essentially sells mining equipment by TH/s and farm electricity at cost to retailers who want to participate in mining. The company will not charge customers hosting and management fees until the mining profits they receive break even on their investment.      HashAge and Heng Jia, two long-running bitcoin mining farm operators with over a dozen facilities in Sichuan, also announced a partnership with Chinese crypto lending startup Babel last Friday.      Flex Yang, CEO and co-founder of Babel, said the firm is allocating up to $50 million in USDT as a loan for those who choose to host their miners at HashAge and Heng Jia’s facilities.      In contrast to previous crypto loans that require borrowers to pledge bitcoin as collateral, this new partnership accepts debtors’ miners hosted at HashAge and Heng Jia as collateral.      This effort is also one of the industry’s first in terms of treating specialized mining equipment, known as ASIC miners, as a tradable asset in crypto-based debt financing.    Luxor, a U.S.-based mining pool, rolled out a bitcoin hashrate price indexhttps://hashrateindex.com/summary/sha256 earlier last month in an effort to provide better transparency into the traditionally opaque market of how much bitcoin mining equipment is changing hands.  Floods    But rain cuts both ways for the mining industry. Flooding in China is among the worst in decades, and has affected over 50 million residents, with nearly four million people displaced and over 150 dead or missing.      The good news is it could have been much worse. Pan said the flood has so far mainly affected the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river.      Since most mining farms in Sichuan and Yunnan are located along the upper reaches in the mountain area, which are some 1,200 km, or 800 miles, away from the middle reaches, there are fewer instances where facilities are directly flooded due to the rainfall.      But Pan said there have been more regular instances of mining farms’ hydropower plants temporarily cutting off electricity generation because the increasing water reserve levels would otherwise cause pressure on the dam.      The places that are suffering the most severe damage so far are provinces in Central China including Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan and Anhui provinces, as illustrated in this multimedia article from the South China Morning Post.      Johnson Xu, chief analyst at Beijing-based research startup TokenInsight, said mining farm operators nowadays are more experienced in choosing the right location for construction, after witnessing events in previous years where facilities were destroyed by floods and mudslides.      “Chinese mining farms have already conducted thorough due diligence to pick the locations where potential flooding risk is minimal,” so the floods haven't caused a major impact on the mining community, said Xu.      Read more:Bitcoin Miners Halt Operations as Rainstorm Triggers Mudslides in China    Tug of war    Another reason why there are too many bitcoin mining farms is the push by local governments in Sichuan for establishing the so-called “Demonstration Zone for Utilizing Excessive Hydropower Electricity” since late last year.      Mining farms and hydropower plants that choose to be based in these industrial parks can typically enjoy a stable operational environment with a steady and cheap power supply. In return, they give a portion of their profits to local governments as well as China’s State Grid, the state-owned utility monopoly.      In previous years, many mining farms in Sichuan and Yunnan have been using what’s called “direct-supply” electricity. That means power plants sell electricity directly to mining farm operators without having to share the profits with other parties.      As local governments have stepped up efforts to rectify the “direct-supply” model adopted by many power plants, this has created a sort of tug of war among local governments, hydropower plants as well as the State Grid, Pan said.      Some bitcoin mining farm operators using “direct-supply” electricity wish to sell their facilities at a low valuation given tough market conditions. This tug-of-war will continue to be a risk factor for potential investors in those mining farms.      “Overall, the latest regulatory policies in China tend to have a negative impact on those unregulated smaller mining farms, but positive towards firms who meet the local regulatory requirements,” Xu added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/04/the-2020-rainy-season-is-tougher-than-ever-for-chinas-bitcoin-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e333d10f7806919a67575a9f0f8ce81c05c728c-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
