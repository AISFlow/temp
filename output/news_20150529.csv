42426352,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxTh,1432929797,Silk Road Operator Ross Ulbricht Sentenced to Life in Prison,"Ross Ulbricht  has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the operation of Silk Road, the now-defunct online dark market.  The sentence was handed down by US District Judge Katherine Forrest in New York today, capping roughly a year and a half-long legal process that saw multiple bitcoin auctions and the shock indictment of two federal agents involved in the investigation.  In addition to the prison term, Ulbricht has been ordered to pay nearly $200m. In a 28th May court filing, US prosecutors asked Forrest to require that Ulbricht pay $183,961,921 to the federal government, an amount tied to proceeds related to the operation of Silk Road during its active period.  During the hearing, Forrest is said to have rejected Ulbricht's contention that the site's creation was borne out of youthful naïveté.  “It was a carefully planned life’s work,” she said, according to a report by Bloomberg. “It was your opus.”  According to Motherboard, Forrest also questioned Ulbricht's decision to keep a log of his Silk Road activities.  ""It is still unclear to me why you ever kept a journal,"" she said.  Ulbricht, who ran the marketplace under the name Dread Pirate Roberts, was convicted in February on seven charges related to narcotics distribution, computer hacking and conspiracy. Ulbricht's defense is expected to appeal the conviction.  Ulbricht wasn't the only person affiliated with Silk Road to be sentenced this week. In a Chicago court case, a well-known Silk Road vender known as ""Super Trips"" was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Cornelis Jan Slomp previously plead guilty to drug trafficking, according to a report by Deep Dot Web.  Separately, a Louisiana man was charged by the US Department of Justice yesterday with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit trademark counterfeiting. Beau Wattigney, 30, has been accused of selling fake coupons on Silk Road.

42426363,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxrh,1432917659,Koinify to Stop Token Sales Ahead of Platform Pivot,"Koinify has announced that it will no longer offer a token sales platform for decentralised applications (DApps).  The startup indicated that it would ""provide assistance"" to startups already slated to sell their software tokens on the service, including the decentralised prediction market Augur and the blockchain-based trading card game Spells of Genesis.  Koinify declined to elaborate on the transition in interview and in its official release, though CEO Tom Ding hinted that the company's platform could remain somewhat similar with its technology being applied to a ""broader market"".  Ding told CoinDesk:  ""We increasingly realize that the DApp market, while exciting, is too niche of a market for us at this stage to sustain standalone as a business.""  Ding declined to specify when a product would be available, but noted that Koinify will be increasing the size of its team as part of the pivot away from its original focus.  ""The fundamentals – including our belief in blockchain, and using blockchain as our underlying technology innovation, and trying to reinventing business and organizational structure, has remain unchanged,"" Ding continued.  In a separate blog post, Koinify asked users to withdraw tokens purchased during the GetGems crowdsale from its platform by 30th June.  Ding dismissed rumors that the move was due to regulatory pressure given the ongoing uncertainty around cryptographic tokens and their use in value exchange.  ""Our legal team was very comfortable with our existing model,"" he told CoinDesk.  Launched in September 2014, Koinify raised $1m from investors including IDG Capital Partners, zPark Ventures and an AngelList syndicate headed by VC investor and Bitcoin Foundation board chairman Brock Pierce.

42426365,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxvh,1432913195,Bitcoin in the Headlines: A Clash of Economics,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at bitcoin news, analyzing media and its impact.  Despite featuring its fair share of salacious material – including the run-up to the sentencing in the Ross Ulbricht trial, this week's news cycle was perhaps more mature in its assessment of bitcoin as a financial technology.  Spurred by the inclusion of former US Department of Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to Xapo's board of directors, more enterprising journalists sought to venture into topics that aimed to illuminate debates on bitcoin as a monetary system.  Arguments centered largely on whether bitcoin represents a truly unique breakthrough in the history of money, one that can only be compared to disruptive technologies like the Internet, or whether it is a passing fad, one that, despite promise, is doomed to repeat past mistakes.  Summers meets magnifying glass  FT Alphaville's Izabella Kaminska, one of the more outspoken and well-spoken bitcoin critics, produced a retrospective piece which questioned Summers' motives for joining the board of bitcoin firm Xapo.  Kaminska made her opinion of the company known, chiding Xapo for its business model. A specialist in deep cold storage, Xapo uses a process by which bitcoins are kept secure in reinforced underground bunkers with all manner of military-grade protections.  Here, Kaminska reintroduces the idea that bitcoin is a speculative bubble that will eventually deflate, one akin to the 'tulip mania' of the 1600s where the value of tulips skyrocketed, only to again fall.  Using past statements, Kaminska aimed to suggest that Summers should perhaps be against the idea that bitcoins could have lasting value.  She wrote:  ""Worth noting in this context, of course, is that Larry Summers is also the man arguing that bubbles are a bit of an inevitability in a secular stagnated world.""  Kaminska cites Summers' statement in the Financial Times from last year, in which he is quoted as saying:  ""It is better to support demand by supporting productive investment or highly valued consumption than by artificially inflating bubbles. On the other hand, it is only rational to recognise that low interest rates raise asset values and drive investors to take greater risks, making bubbles more likely.""  Summers himself has presented mixed views on bitcoin in public appearances. For example, Summers has sought to portray the payments network as one that requires the help of regulation to succeed.  Further, much of his praise for bitcoin seems based in its comparison to the Internet, which he noted was also roundly dismissed in its early days.  Still, this didn't stop Kaminska from poking fun at Summers' appointment to the company's board.  ""You might as well sit on the advisory boards of the companies pumping [bubbles] so as to advise and steer them?"" she concluded.  Speculation on speculation  Elsewhere, the evolution of the bitcoin economy was discussed by Barry Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group and a noted early-stage investor in bitcoin startups.  Speaking to Entrepreneur, during the Inside Bitcoins Conference in New York last month, Silbert discussed whether he felt bitcoin could become a stable form of money, or rather, how it could develop into a perhaps more mature means of value exchange.  Silbert said:  ""I do think today the main use of bitcoin is speculative investment, which I think is OK, because in order for bitcoin to become a rail we have to have a monetary base. The monetary base of bitcoin today is about $4bn, which does not lend itself to be used as a rail.  Silbert added that he believes bitcoin must still be ""established as a form of value"", suggesting that this evolution will likely take place over time.  ""For bitcoin to be a global currency the volatility has to decrease or we need to hedge out risk,"" he said.  Silbert's statements follow Bloomberg's Bitcoin Brief, released last week. The report, to which Silbert contributed, tackled the question of how speculation is affecting the bitcoin economy, suggesting that this is perhaps holding back bitcoin from becoming a true digital currency.  ""There's a rule in economics called Gresham's law, which is that when you have two currencies, people tend to hoard the one with greater material value and spend the one with less material value,"" it reads, continuing:  ""If people think bitcoin has value as a speculative asset, they will hoard it, and buy their groceries with greenbacks instead – after all, they expect bitcoin's price to go up, and the price of greenback to go down.""  ""This makes it more difficult for bitcoin to establish itself as a medium of exchange, because no one wants to actually spend them,"" concluded the report.  A question of worth  Linking into the debate, Forbes, a regular in this weekly series, re-posted a Quora piece with the following headline ""Is the Price of Bitcoin Going to Bounce Back?""  The piece again takes on the question of how the health of bitcoin's economy should be assessed.  ""Given that the price of bitcoin is determined solely by supply and demand, and that the supply of new bitcoins is predetermined, with new coins being issued steadily at a rate that drops sharply in the future, the only variable of interest is demand.""  The piece continued:  ""And the demand for bitcoin is determined by how useful bitcoins are to people. So if you want to know whether the price of bitcoins will go up in the future, you have to ask yourself how useful you think bitcoins are going to be.""  The article seemed less positive with regard's to the digital currency's potential, at least today, arguing that there has been little evidence to suggest the technology is mature enough to compete against traditional financial incumbents.  ""To somebody who already has access to modern financial tools like bank accounts and credit cards, these are very few new things bitcoin has to offer,"" the report read. ""The compelling uses for bitcoin so far are to serve as a vehicle for speculation [...] and as a method of gambling and making purchases on the dark markets"".  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

42426358,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMxdh,1432889607,Australia's Commonwealth Bank Latest to Experiment With Ripple,"The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) announced this week it will use Ripple technology to facilitate payments between its subsidiaries, describing distributed protocols as ""the way of the future"".  Last May, Germany's Fidor became the first bank to integrate Ripple's protocol into its payments infrastructure, with two US banks, CBW Bank and Cross River Bank, following suit four months later.  Tech news site CIO quoted the CBA's own Chief Information Officer David Whiteing as saying the bank had ""done a whole bunch of experiments"" with bitcoin and other cryptocurrency technologies.  Whiteing said he sees no reason why bank accounts could not be used to store fiat money, cryptocurrencies and other assets like store loyalty points in the future.  He added:  ""Bitcoin is a protocol which is now being replicated by non-asset based vendors like Ripple and others. We absolutely see that’s where it’s going to go. The bank has a role to play in that.""  A spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk that the CBA has been performing tests with cryptocurrency technologies.  The organisation will begin a wider experiment with one of its offshore subsidiaries to explore the benefits of intrabank transfers using these protocols, they said, adding:  ""The idea is to test in a controlled environment what a bank-to-bank internal transfer might look like using crypto rather than existing payment providers. We are ensuring our testing remains internal within Commonwealth Bank Group and we continue to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements.""  Banking giant  While its decision to use Ripple for payments between subsidiaries remains experimental, the Commonwealth Bank's sheer size makes its announcement all the more significant.  The 104 year-old banking group is one of Australia's 'big four'. According to its 2014 Annual Report, it made AU$8.65bn ($6.84bn) profit and has over 44,300 full-time employees.  CBA recently acquired a digital banking-related business in South Africa, Tyme Capital.  Whiteing made several references to mobile banking and payments solutions, especially in Africa where 1.2 billion people have far greater access to mobile phone services than traditional banking networks.  The CBA's mobile banking app in Australia already supports up to 15 international currencies, allowing its 3.5 million users to make instant payments in whichever one they choose. It ""shouldn’t be that difficult"" to add cryptocurrencies to that list, he said.  Asia-Pacific focus  Ripple Labs and its subsidiary XRP II appeared to be going through a rocky period after being fined $700,000 by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for non-reporting of certain transactions in 2013-14.  It bounced back just two weeks later, however, with an announcement it had raised $28m in Series A funding from several venture capital and technology companies.  As part of its expansion efforts, Ripple Labs announced at the beginning of April that it would open subsidiaries in the Asia-Pacific region to focus on the over $3tn in intra-Asia trade, which is expected to surpass European trade flows to be the world's largest by 2016.  Its first regional office opened in Sydney under new managing director Dilip Rao, and is currently undertaking a local hiring drive.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/05/29/australias-commonwealth-bank-latest-to-experiment-with-ripple,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b7d4c806dff0e740751a45f718c39fc7dee101d-1500x972.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
