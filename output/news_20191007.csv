In an announcement dated Oct. 4, Nomura Holdings, the parent company of Nomura Securities, said it made an investment in LVC, a subsidiary of South Korean-controlled Line, following an agreement signed on Sept. 24.  Terms were not disclosed.  Nomura said that the venture will be developing financial services utilizing blockchain technology. The partnership will make use of Line's large user base—81 million in Japan—and well-developed user experience and Nomura's financial experience and expertise.  The release also mentions LVC's Bitmax exchange, which went live on Sept. 17, less than two weeks after receiving approval from Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA).  In January 2019, the companies announced that they were engaged in negotiations on the deal with a March target for final agreement. The earlier disclosure mentions that LVC's capital will be increased through a placement of new shares to Nomura.  In the January announcement, LVC's capital is listed as 1.21 billion yen ($11.3 million) as of Jul. 31, 2018. In the recent release, the company's capital is listed as 5.06 billion yen as of Oct. 4. 2019, suggesting that Nomura may have invested almost 4 billion yen in the company.  Shinjuku, Tokyo-based Line is 73.36-percent owned by South Korea's Naver, a listed technology conglomerate.  Nomura has been on a tear for some time in terms of blockchain investment. In May 2018, it formed Komainu with Ledger and Global Advisors to develop digital custody solutions. In July this year, the company invested in San Francisco-based Quantstamp, a smart-contract security company, and in September this year, it set up Boostry with Nomura Research Institute. The venture is developing blockchain solutions for trading securities. Just last week, Nomura and five other brokerages formed a self-regulatory organization (SRO) for crypto offerings.  While Japanese regulators have been cautious due to the 2014 collapse of Mt Gox and the 2018 hack of Coincheck, recent signs suggest they are warming crypto. In addition to approving new exchanges, the FSA has issued guideline on fund investment in crypto.

42431062,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzZDh,1570482021,"Microsoft, Intel Back Ethereum-Based Token to Reward Consortium Efforts","The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), the consortium charged with creating standards for businesses to build applications using the ethereum blockchain, has created a system of reward tokens to incentivize groups of companies. The system is backed by Microsoft and Intel.  Showcased Tuesday at Devcon 5, the annual ethereum developers conference being held in Osaka, Japan, the so-called trusted reward token is a way of accruing and calculating rewards for active participation in a consortium.  Michael Reed, who manages the blockchain program within Intel’s software and solutions group, explained there are three types of tokens used to motivate participation: a reward token, a reputation token, and a penalty token.  Reed told CoinDesk:  “It really can be applied to any consortium to incentivize teamwork. The example we are using is a software development consortium like EEA, where we are trying to motivate activities like editing and contributing to specifications, developing and adding code. Then, of course, you could apply penalties for negatives, such as lack of contribution, lack of review, missing deadlines and so on.”  The idea of using tokens to align companies continues a long-standing strain of thought within the ethereum community. Manifested in early experiments with decentralized autonomous organizations and chief scientist Vitalik Buterin’s interest in concepts like futarchy, this sort of tokenization lets organizations use economic bets and voting to guide decision-making.  The trusted reward token is the first use case to emerge from the Token Taxonomy Initiative (TTI), born within Microsoft to establish a common framework for tokenizing value across a range of blockchain networks, not just within the EEA or on ethereum. (Also involved in the build were: ConsenSys Solutions, PegaSys, and Kaleido; Envision Blockchain; and iExec.)  The TTI operates rather like a workshop where firms can decide what features they require from a token, such as being fungible or non-fungible; transferable or non-transferable; and which networks they might using, be that Hyperledger, R3 Corda or ethereum.  Carrot and stick  In the same way that the ERC-20 standard has been ascribed to various networks and use cases, the trusted reward token can be attached to any unit of value the consortium agrees upon. Describing the rewards process as “grant contracts,” Marley Gray, principal architect at Microsoft, said: “Really we have the ability to tag it anything.”  To effectively incentivize participants requires not only a carrot but also a stick, said Gray, noting that all the penalty tokens a participant accumulates (demerits, essentially) have to be factored in before rewards tokens can be redeemed.  “One of the problems you have is people making large commitments but never following through,” he said. “This is almost more damaging than not stepping up at all because it leads to long delays when people are thinking things are happening and they are not.”  It’s perhaps not surprising a tokenized rewards system has been born out of the EEA, where 250-plus member companies have been herded together to work out a set of common interoperable specs and standards, a difficult job which has been driven by executive director Ron Resnick.  “Devcon 5 will be where attendees will experience how ethereum – enabled by EEA member-driven standards – delivers real-world value through tokenized enterprise solutions,"" said Resnick.

Robertson announced the move in a statement on Monday, saying since her husband's death late last year, she had ""made every effort"" to assist in the recovery of QuadrigaCX's assets.  The exchange folded earlier this year, after Robertson and other Quadriga-affiliated entities realized they did not have access to the company's cold wallets, and therefore could not access any of the crypto assets the exchange held. (A subsequent investigation by EY raised doubts as to whether the exchange actually held any customer funds at the time of Cotten's death.)  In the statement sent to CoinDesk through a lawyer, Robertson said:  ""I have now entered into a voluntary settlement agreement where the vast majority of my assets and all of the Estate’s assets are being returned to QCX to benefit the Affected Users. These assets originally came from QCX at the direction of Gerry.""  The settlement is pending approval from a judge.  According to a new report by EY Canada, Robertson will be turning over all assets except for roughly $162,700 in personal assets, which include cash, her retirement savings, a 2015 Jeep, some jewelry, personal furnishings, clothing and some outstanding shares of Quadriga and affiliated entities.  A previous report estimated the total value of Cotten's estate to include roughly $9 million ($12 million CAD) in assets, including luxury vehicles and more than a dozen properties in Nova Scotia.  EY said in Monday’s report that it intends to liquidate these assets for Quadriga’s stakeholders, including the users who lost funds when the exchange collapsed.  Monday’s report noted that a settlement allowed the parties to avoid legal fees that would be incurred by litigation. Further, as part of the settlement, Robertson will no longer receive any payments under a previous court order.  Robertson added that she had ""no direct knowledge"" of how Quadriga operated and was unaware that Cotten had commingled client and corporate funds, as EY later found.  ""Specifically, I was not aware of nor participated in Gerry’s trading activities, nor his appropriation of the Affected User’s funds,"" she said in Monday’s statement.  Monday’s report further added that Robertson suggested a settlement offer after the auditor published its previous report in June 2019.

42431056,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzZ7h,1570460401,NBA's Sacramento Kings to Reward Loyal Fans With Crypto Tokens,"The NBA’s Sacramento Kings are the first U.S. professional sports team to develop a crypto token for fan rewards.  “Fans can get those points and put them in their wallets and experience it all on the blockchain platform,” Kings CTO Ryan Montoya told CoinDesk.  Further, Montoya said the token, called Kings Token, will pair with a predictive gaming platform the team has developed in anticipation of the legalization of sports betting in California (the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal restriction on sports betting in May 2018).  The Kings Token is a joint effort with blockchain-based event ticketing platform Blockparty.  “In our opinion, the blockchain has a role in the entire event experience,” Vladislav Ginzburg, Blockparty’s chief development officer, told CoinDesk. “Whether it’s a sports game, music festival or Broadway show.”  Blockparty is putting together a case study on the project, CEO Shiv Madan added, in the hope that it will be shared with other NBA teams if the project is deemed a success.  All-tech team  It’s just the latest foray into blockchain technology for the Sacramento team, which is based 90 miles northeast of San Francisco.  In 2014, the Kings became the first NBA team to accept bitcoin as payment in its arena. Last year, the Kings became the first professional sports team to mine cryptocurrency, setting up a program called MiningForGood that donates the funds to charity.  Kings Tokens will exist within a token wallet added to the team's Golden 1 Center app, which tracks the engagement and accumulated points of fans. Fans can earn rewards through the predictive gaming platform and redeem those points for access to unique events, signed merchandise or courtside tickets, for example.  The ERC-20 token will run on ethereum but will only initially be usable within the team's Golden 1 Center arena. While fans won’t be able to trade the token for another currency or have a private key, they will be able to show a QR code to redeem points and see the confirmation of transactions through a block explorer. In testnet now, the Kings plans to launch the token by opening night on Oct. 25.  In future iterations, token users may be able to transfer tokens to their peers, and earn rewards by eating at nearby restaurants or making it to the game before tip-off, Ginzburg added.  “This is a mass adoption story,” Ginzburg said, adding:  “Forty-one games of 20,000 people – I’m going to go ahead and say that many of those people don’t own any crypto whatsoever. Suddenly by downloading the Golden 1 Center app, they are going to have an ERC-20 wallet with an ERC-20 token.”  Golden 1 Center image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/07/nbas-sacramento-kings-to-reward-loyal-fans-with-crypto-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afca8c5b9429f0e449c7c0b3462d22a137e76625-500x334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431060,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzZFh,1570459436,"Crypto Traders' Lawsuit Claims Bitfinex, Tether Cost Market Over $1 Trillion","A new lawsuit claims crypto exchange Bitfinex and its sister company Tether manipulated the crypto market, harming traders and benefiting themselves.  Bitfinex and a number of affiliated entities engaged in deceptive, anti-competitive and market-manipulating practices, resulting in economic damages for the plaintiffs, according to a lawsuit filed Sunday in New York.  Notably, the plaintiffs, who seek class-action status, claim that the total damages add up to more than $1 trillion, writing:  ""Calculating damages at this stage is premature, but there is little doubt that the scale of harm wrought by the Defendants is unprecedented. Their liability to the putative class likely surpasses $1.4 trillion U.S. dollars.""  The lawsuit, filed by David Leibowitz, Benjamin Leibowitz, Jason Leibowitz, Aaron Leibowitz and Pinchas Goldshtein, are represented by Vel Freedman and Kyle Roche – the lawyers who recently won a federal case against Craig Wright. Bitfinex, Tether, Digfinex and current executives; former chief strategy officer Philip Potter; and payment processor Crypto Capital are named as defendants in the case.  ""The crimes committed by Tether, Bitfinex, Crypto Capital, and their executives include Bank Fraud, Money Laundering; Monetary Transactions Derived From Specified Unlawful Activities, Operating an Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business, and Wire Fraud,"" the filing says.  In the complaint, the plaintiffs further claim Bitfinex and Tether ""shared false information about USDT being backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars,"" referring to an allegation made by the New York Attorney General's office in April. It continues to allege the USDT was used to purchase bitcoin to inflate the crypto market, spurring the 2017-2018 bull market and subsequent bust.  In a statement sent to CoinDesk after this article was published, David Leibowitz said, ""As someone who has been invested in bitcoin and the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, I believe that bad actors in this space have stunted development and consumer confidence.""  Market manipulation?  In response to a request for comment, Bitfinex/Tether spokesperson Joe Morgan sent CoinDesk a statement published over the weekend, which stated that the companies expected a lawsuit based on ""an unpublished and non-peer reviewed paper falsely positing that Tether issuances are responsible for manipulating the cryptocurrency market.""  It went on to add:  ""Tether and its affiliates have never used Tether tokens or issuances to manipulate the cryptocurrency market or token pricing. All Tether tokens are fully backed by reserves and are issued pursuant to market demand, and not for the purpose of controlling the pricing of crypto assets. It is irresponsible to suggest that Tether enables illicit activity due to its efficiency, liquidity and wide-scale applicability within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.""  In a statement, Roche said, ""There was an enormous amount of work put in by the lawyers of our firm, particularly by Joseph Delich, to research the facts related to the conduct outlined in our complaint. I look forward to working with my team as the litigation plays out.""  Allegations that Tether has been used to manipulate the cryptocurrency market have circulated for more than a year. In a study published last June, researchers with the University of Texas at Austin said bitcoin’s price rose after the ""the Bitfinex exchange use[d] tether to purchase bitcoin when prices are falling.""  The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly looking into the allegations, though it is unclear if the Department has drawn any conclusions at this time.  However, another study published last September by University of Queensland professor Wang Chun Wei found that while ""tether grants were potentially timed to follow bitcoin downturns,"" the actual correlation was ""not statistically significant.""

Marking the occasion, the company launched its public testnet.  NuCypher's particular product is based on proxy re-encryption, which allows files to be encrypted to lots of people and for administrators to grant and revoke access based on certain conditions. The company dates back to 2015, but it began looking at tokens as a way to decentralize its infrastructure in 2017.  CoinDesk covered NuCypher as one of the buzzy initial coin offerings (ICOs) of 2017, but the company ultimately opted not to pursue a public token sale. Instead, it ran one SAFT for $4.4 million in 2017.  In an email to CoinDesk, NuCyhper co-founder and CEO MacLane Wilkison said the new SAFT comes as the company nears mainnet launch:  ""The launch of our public testnet is the culmination of over two years of hard work to bring data privacy to dApps built on Ethereum and other public blockchains. The network is now fully implemented and ready to enter its final stress testing phase.""  Other participants in the round include Bitmain, Bitfury, Y Combinator Continuity Fund, Compound VC, Notation Capital, DHVC, Hashed, Arrington XRP Capital and CoinFund.  This round of investors has agreed to lock their tokens for the purpose of staking nodes that will run the NuCypher software. The protocol decentralizes by allowing nodes to earn tokens by making encryption computations. The investors will lose their stakes, however, if they are found to be acting maliciously.  Participants in the newest SAFT purchased 8 percent of the initial token supply of 1 billion ERC-20 tokens, with 31 percent having been sold in the prior $4.4 million round. Node operators will be paid in a combination of new token emissions and network fees. Like many other networks, inflation will diminish over time as fees increase with usage.  Get tokens  In order to further decentralize the network, NuCyhper announced a distribution method called a WorkLock. The precise terms have not yet been released but the mechanics have been described in a Medium post.  In short, new users can put ETH into a smart contract and they will receive NuCypher tokens. Their ETH will be burned, however, unless they use the NuCypher tokens to stake a node for a certain amount of time.  This should discourage people from claiming NuCypher tokens unless they intend to be users. Somewhere between 25o–400 million tokens will be designated for distribution through the WorkLock.  While participating requires technical skills, NuCypher has tried to facilitate it as much as possible. It has already released staking documentation. Many well-known staking operators such as Bison Trails, Grassfed Networks and Staked (among others) are already running NuCypher.  To foster app building, NuCyhper ran a hackathon with CoinList and several minimum viable products are live now, including Stridon, for paid blogging; Snowden, for posting on social media so your friends can read it and the platform can't; and NuBox, for encrypted file storage.

The futures product will be available Oct. 24 and will pay out in Libra tokens.  Libra’s launch date – originally slated for early 2020 and now looking more like the end of the year, if not much later – has been pushed back following regulatory backlash and partner exits, such as PayPal's departure this past week. Some nation's lawmakers have even called for the project to be halted.  “Facebook has the ability to rival the entire global banking system from day one, but, because of that fact, when that first day will be is far from certain,” CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb told Bloomberg. “The political backlash has been brutal, and it’s anyone’s guess if Facebook will get this over the line.”  Prices for the futures are set at $0.30, which equates to a 30 percent likelihood of Libra launching by the settlement date, Lamb explained.

42403316,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfifl,1570446001,Bitcoin Bounces Back to $8K From Historically Strong Price Support,"View  Bitcoin has again bounced up from the 100-week moving average – a level which has acted as strong support in the previous two weeks and during the early stages of the previous bull market.  The defense of the 100-week MA coupled with the oversold conditions on the daily chart suggests scope for a recovery rally to $8,500.  The case for a bounce would weaken if prices find acceptance below the support level, currently at $7,753. That could pave the way for a slide to $7,200.      Bitcoin (BTC) has again defended historically strong price support near $7,700, keeping the hopes of a corrective rally alive.  The top cryptocurrency faced selling pressure and fell below $8,000 over the weekend, contradicting the possibility of a recovery rally above $8,500 suggested by a key technical indicator on Friday.  Even so, all is not lost for the bulls, as the widely-tracked 100-week moving average (MA) support has held ground. BTC almost tested the key technical line at $7,753 in the Asian trading hours before rising back above $8,000 around 12:20 UTC.  Notably, the long-term MA has been acting as strong support since the last week of September. Now, the bears' repeated failure to penetrate key support may draw bids from short-term traders, yielding a corrective rally.  BTC's defense of the 100-day MA may also excite long-term investors, as the MA had served as a base during nascent stages of the previous bull market, as seen in the chart below.  Weekly chart  Bitcoin picked up a bid at lows near $200 in August 2015 and found acceptance above the 100-week MA in December. The cryptocurrency then faced buyer exhaustion above $460 and fell back to the 100-week MA support in the week ended Jan. 17, 2016.  The support level, then located at $367, was defended in the following three weeks, after which BTC never looked back and went on to hit a record high of $20,000 by December 2017.  Essentially, BTC created a higher low along the 100-week MA seven months ahead of the mining reward halving, which took place in August 2016.  The price action seen this year looks very similar to the one seen in 2015-2016. For instance, BTC bottomed out in the first quarter and rose to a high of $13,880 at the end of June before falling back to the 100-week MA.  More importantly, the latest defense of the 100-week MA comes seven months ahead of the next reward halving, scheduled for May 2020.  If history repeats itself, BTC could chart a solid bounce from the 100-week MA support over the next few weeks.  Moreover, many observers view the current dip as an opportunity to board the bitcoin feight train. For instance, George McDonaugh, CEO and co-founder of KR1 plc, the London-listed cryptocurrency and blockchain investment company, told CoinDesk Markets he expects bitcoin to surpass the all-time high of $20,000 in the first half of 2020.  The short-term technical charts are also calling a corrective bounce.  Daily and weekly chart  Bitcoin's recent drop to sub-$7,800 levels is accompanied by falling trading volumes (above left). A low-volume drop is often short-lived.  Further, the oversold reading on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has gained credence due to signs of seller exhaustion near the 100-week MA. At the same time, the MACD histogram is producing shallow bars below the zero line, a sign of weakening bearish momentum.  All-in-all, a bounce to the 200-day moving average (MA) at $8,564 still looks likely. A violation there would expose resistance at $8,833 (June 2 high).  If prices find acceptance below the 100-week MA at $7,753, the case for a corrective rally would weaken and the cryptocurrency would likely drop to $7,200. Note that the weekly chart indicators are biased bearish.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands near $8,000 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.7 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.

The Financial Times said on Monday that it had obtained information indicating that the FCA is now looking into 87 firms in the space, either as part of initial scrutiny or full enforcement investigations. That number is 74 percent up from the same time in 2018, when 50 crypto firms were being investigated by the authority.  The data was reportedly provided by David Heffron, partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, who told the FT that the spike in numbers “reflects the FCA’s increasingly hands-on and no-nonsense approach"" to the cryptocurrency industry.  Back in May, the FCA warned that there had been a three-fold rise in reports of online platforms fleecing investors with cryptocurrency and forex scams. The 1,800 reported scams in 2018-2019 had given rise to £27 million ($33.2 million) in lost funds, it estimated.  The authority said fraudsters tend to use social media to promote their schemes, often using fake celebrity endorsements and images of luxury items to lure naive investors.  The FCA also recently issued guidance for the crypto industry that clarified which tokens fall under its jurisdiction, and which – like bitcoin and ethereum – don't.

42403313,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfibp,1570442412,Meet the Russian Oligarch Launching a Metal-Backed Crypto Token,"The Takeaway  Norilsk Nickel, a Russia-based metal company, is launching a palladium-backed token and an exchange for tokenized commodities.  CEO Vladimir Potanin, one of the richest industrialists in Russia, told CoinDesk about the project in an exclusive interview.  The token is based on Hyperledger Fabric and developed with the support of IBM, Potanin says.  Norilsk Nickel is reaching out to a broad range of regulators, setting up entities in Switzerland and the U.S. and starting a pilot with Russia's central bank, Potanin says.      Vladimir Potanin is used to dealing in hard realities.  The billionaire oligarch started his business empire in the Wild East days of the 1990s, when the assets of the old Soviet Union were up for grabs and opportunistic entrepreneurs could make mega-roubles if they were in the right place at the right time.  The son of a foreign trade official, Potanin authored the infamous loans-to-shares program that allowed a group of businessmen to buy Russia’s key industrial entities cheaply, later becoming the richest people in the country. He went on to build Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel), one of the world's largest producers of palladium and refined nickel.  Potanin’s wealth is made of metal. But last week, sitting in a luxury New York hotel, his mind was on more immaterial things – like digitized tokens and distributed ledgers.  Looking relaxed in a polo shirt and blazer, Potanin, now 58, discussed how to represent metals as digital assets (built with IBM), streamline his business with distributed databases (built on Hyperledger), and give investors new ways to participate in his business. He wants to get more Russian enterprises thinking about how to use blockchain technology.  Lead from Vitalik  Potanin's curiosity for blockchain technology partly originated from listening to Vitalik Buterin, ethereum’s creator, the billionaire said.  A curious detail: an avid ice hockey player who is known for playing with Russian President Vladimir Putin in amateur games, Potanin once invested in a hockey analytics startup founded by a friend of Buterin’s father.  While Potanin hasn’t met Buterin in person, he heard Vitalik speak about blockchain and was intrigued, he said:  “The knowledge of what he is doing and what he has achieved, of course, encouraged me that the young generation is moving in that direction. [I thought] I should be aware of what they’re doing and why, and I should benefit from this experience.”  After learning more about blockchain he reasoned that Nornickel could benefit from adopting its principles, for instance using distributed databases for managing internet-of-things data from his smelting operations.  At the same time, Nornickel is also issuing its own token, providing a new, more flexible way of managing sales contracts, Potanin says, and a new way for investors to participate in the company’s operations in Northern Siberia.  Palladium coins  “We are trying to digitize all our sales contracts because it looks more efficient, transaction costs are lower and it adds flexibility for our clients,” Potanin said. Sometimes Nornickel’s clients, like auto companies, might order too much palladium and need to renegotiate their contracts and buy less than they initially ordered. He says that’s easier to manage if the contract is tokenized.  “If you don’t need a certain amount of material you can split a token in parts and sell it to other clients. And for us, nothing changes: we ship palladium and clients get as much as they need.”  The tokens will be backed either by Nornickel’s guarantee to ship the actual tons of metal or by special metal accounts in a bank if a buyer doesn’t need palladium itself, Potanin adds.  This summer, the company joined Hyperledger, a blockchain consortium led by the Linux Foundation. The token is built on Hyperledger Fabric and supported by IBM. (The tech giant was not able to respond to requests for comment by press time).  Nornickel is also planning to launch a marketplace where its token and similar asset-backed tokens issued by other companies would be traded. Potanin says the palladium token will be available not only to funds and asset managers but also to retail investors:  “For example, you see palladium is going up, but you can’t go to Norilsk Nickel and buy palladium for several million dollars,” Potanin said. “Say, you have $500 in your pocket, and you want to bet on the price of palladium. You enter our platform and get a little portion of palladium in a tokenized form.”  Not everyone wants to buy into a company when what they really want is exposure to an underlying commodity, Potanin said:  “Exposure to Norilsk Nickel is an exposure to Russia, to mining, to rouble, to executive management of Norilsk Nickel and other entities. Some people like this because the stock of Norilsk Nickel goes up. But some people just don’t have expertise to evaluate it.”  He used a real estate analogy: “If you want to buy a flat you don’t want to buy a share in the construction company.”  Asset-backed tokens can be especially attractive for traditional businesses as they may attract money from crypto investors, Potanin said.  “It’s an interesting source of capital with very low transaction costs,” he said. “It might be an interesting way to finance working capital.”  Preston Byrne, a lawyer and astute observer of the blockchain and cryptocurrency fields, believes there will be demand for the kind of commodity speculation Nornickel is enabling with its tokenized palladium.  “If you’re buying palladium in a vault versus buying shares in Norilsk Nickel, those are different assets with different risk,” Byrne said. “Especially if palladium is stored in Switzerland instead of Russia where you have seen the expropriation of oligarchs if they run afoul of the regime.”  Jurisdiction bets  Nornickel is preparing to launch the token using entities the company is setting up in the U.S. and Switzerland.  “We decided not to take any reputational risks and to be 100 percent regulated,” Potanin explains. “We’re making sure we’re in alliance with the regulators of both countries. We will need both the U.S. regulators’ decision and FINMA’s approval in Switzerland to launch.”  What’s more, Potantin’s plans go beyond metals.  In Russia, Nornickel is in “very advanced discussions” with the central bank to launch a pilot project to tokenize other goods, from airplane tickets to shipping containers. (The Bank of Russia did not respond to a request for comment by press time).  Potanin helped write the legislation for digital assets in Russia as a member of a blockchain working group within the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, a lobbying group formed by the country's largest industrial players.  The bill is making its way through Russia’s parliament and Potanin is confident it will pass.  “I hope it will go through the parliament without delay, and I understand that I can start my experiment in Norilsk with the frame of this legislation and under the control of our regulator.”  Risks and hopes  Potanin says he is not particularly interested in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether and didn’t invest in them. He calls bitcoin “a toy” and “a useful souvenir,” but says the issuance of electronic money should be left to central banks.  “I agree with the American regulator that it is a commodity and the quality of this commodity — you really do not know if it's good or not, you buy it at your own risk,” he added.  But he is enthusiastic about the future of asset-backed tokens like the one Nornickel is preparing, as their usefulness goes beyond speculative value, motivating people to learn about the digitized commodities they will be trading:  “People like different kinds of bets, on football or boxing matches, for example. My idea is to encourage people to bet on something real and to learn something: what’s going on with oil, with metals, with ecological programs, what is the behavior of consumers.”  Given Potanin’s high profile (and government connections), some might wonder if Nornickel token projects are an elaborate way to skirt sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and Europe (on the thinking that the tokenized metals markets are less heavily policed than other financial arenas).  But Potanin dismisses the idea. Neither he nor Nornickel has faced any direct sanctions from the West so far.  “For me personally, I don’t think it’s a good protection because sanctions go much further than your ability to have an account in a bank,” he said, adding:  “What makes me really anxious is that people may change and are already changing their attitude towards Russians. Doesn’t matter if it’s true or not, people start thinking, ‘maybe I shouldn’t deal with a Russian guy because who knows whether he’s under sanctions or what happens to him.”  He added that he doesn’t believe this attitude will stop his blockchain project, though:  “In this system that we have now in the world, digital initiatives, high tech and ecological initiatives are the last ones to be attacked and compromised. It’s not a remedy, but I think it’s good to go in that direction.”  Potanin image courtesy of Nornickel",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,"Anna Baydakova, Nate DiCamillo",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/07/meet-the-russian-oligarch-launching-a-metal-backed-crypto-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72978281516a1276588f08b08e001b4149826599-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report from TechCrunch this weekend, Coinbase may grab Omni’s engineering team to further develop its Coinbase Earn product. Coinbase told the tech news site no deal is on the table currently, however.  The acquisition comes amidst layoffs for the rental company, which let seven members of its operations staff go last week. The engineering team has also received interest from Thumbtack, a marketplace for professional services. TechCrunch said the engineers are already interviewing at Coinbase.  Last year, Omni raised $25 million in a funding round led by Ripple executives Stefan Thomas and Chris Larsen, who invested an undisclosed amount of XRP. TechCrunch says Omni was recently looking into launching a rental product for brick-and-mortar stores.

42403301,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfiP2,1570438826,Hyperledger Blockchain Group Weighs Changes to Fix Election Issues,"The Hyperledger blockchain consortium’s technical steering committee (TSC) is discussing potential changes to its elections in hopes of boosting voter turnout.  On Wednesday, Arnaud Le Hors, a blockchain staff member at IBM and TSC chair for 2019-2020, placed on the committee's agenda five proposals to spread awareness and encourage participation in the annual elections. The suggestions came from Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf, who had sent them to the TSC mailing list.  The proposals were added to a backlog of agenda items concerning governance, including a motion to add four seats to the TSC for the 2019-2020 term and fill them with the runners-up from the last election. Other agenda items include adding a vice-chair who would fill in when the chair is unavailable. On Friday, Le Hors announced that Dan Middleton, a principal engineer with Intel who came second place in the election, was the de facto vice-chair.  The reform discussions come after IBM employees won 6 of the committee's 11 seats in the election, an outcome that rattled Hyperledger participants concerned about IBM’s influence in the consortium. (The tech giant has long played a large role at Hyperledger, contributing Fabric, the oldest and biggest Hyperledger project.)  Supported by the Linux Foundation, Hyperledger is one of the three major platforms for enterprise blockchain software development, with 14 active projects, some involving household-name corporations such as Walmart and Target. The TSC is responsible for creating working groups to focus on technical issues, approving projects and reviewing updates.  “The email I sent was to communicate back to the community some of the concerns which Hyperledger staff talked internally about,” Behlendorf said. “Some of them are mundane – like August might be a bad time to do critical things like an election.”  Behlendorf suggested that voter data should instead be collected in September and elections held in October. He also suggested that the TSC redefine who may vote.  Currently, anyone who contributes code to the platform can vote. But this sometimes leaves Hyperledger having to weed out invalid email addresses of users who put in a fake address to avoid spam or had an email on file that was dead after a job switch.  New oversight  More significantly, Behlendorf proposed that the process and timeline of the elections should be offered by Hyperledger staff to the steering committee for approval, making the election details more public and well-known. (Hyperledger uses the Condorcet Internet Voting Service developed at Cornell University).  “Many open-source projects depend entirely on volunteer labor from the developers themselves to do governance, housekeeping, and marketing functions,” Behlendorf said. At Hyperledger, “the running of the election is done by a couple of people at the Linux Foundation and this lifts the burden for the developer community. We have to make sure the TSC and governing board knows what we are doing and has enough oversight.”  This oversight would include two election observers who are not on TSC but are longtime members of Hyperledger, Behlendorf added. These observers would not be able to see private votes but could “look over our shoulder as we work,” he said. At the Oct. 3 TSC meeting, however, committee members raised concerns about confidentiality with election observers that they felt “ill-equipped” to handle.  Behlendorf also suggested that nominations be emailed to the TSC mailing list again. In the last election, members filled out forms and their nominations were pooled into a spreadsheet, resulting in members being nominated without their knowledge.  “We had three people nominated by others who didn’t know that they were nominated,” he said. “We restarted the election two days later after pulling their names off.”  Voting image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/10/07/hyperledger-blockchain-group-weighs-changes-to-fix-election-issues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abf98b3abab9cfdcf310e97f14768e870f5c3afd-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403306,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfiUw,1570435248,"From Cardano to Ethereum, 2020 Could Be Deciding Year for Proof-of-Stake","2020 will be the year proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains finally break out. Maybe.      Two of the industry’s most hotly anticipated PoS networks are scheduled to (re)launch in Q1 – namely ethereum and Cardano.      The second largest blockchain platform in the world by market capitalization, ethereum has been looking to shift to PoS since 2014. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin sees PoS as key to ethereum reaching maturity.      “Ethereum 1.0 is a couple of people’s scrappy attempt to build the world computer; Ethereum 2.0 [with PoS] will actually be the world computer,” he has said.      Conceptually, PoS has been around since 2012, but its applications thus far on blockchain platforms, such as EOS, Tezos, Cosmos and others, haven’t been proven to outperform proof-of-work (PoW) platforms in usage or market value (bitcoin or ethereum, for instance).      With PoS, validators must own currency they are verifying: ""forgers"" always own the coins being minted. There is no mining, meaning no heinous use of electricity to solve maths problems. Supporters argue that PoS will be magnitudes more scalable, sustainable and secure than traditional PoW blockchain systems, but the jury is still out on its comparative strengths and whether governance can be made to work.      Cardano, rather than launching a new PoS system, is looking to upgrade its own pre-existing PoS platform as a public network.      The 12th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Cardano is currently governed by a federated system of transaction validators made up of three organizations: the Cardano Foundation, Input Out Hong Kong (IOHK) and Emurgo, a structure that drew criticism for being over-concentrated. The public network will have 100 times more people running its software than bitcoin, ethereum or any other PoW system, said Charles Hoskinson, CEO IOHK, the company behind Cardano, in an interview.      “This marks the starting point for handing the [Cardano] protocol completely to the community,” Hoskinson said of next year’s network upgrade, dubbed “Shelley.”      Tim Ogilvie, founder and CEO of multi-blockchain staking service Staked, argues that 2019 has already been a big year for PoS.      “You’ve had millions of dollars of proof-of-stake assets running without a hitch and not spending billions on electricity costs,” he told CoinDesk. “Now, you’re going to see big projects like Cardano and ethereum taking these results even further. We’re definitely excited.”      Ogilvie added:      “There’s probably five or six what we call large-market-size proof-of-stake coins and Cardano is one of them. It’s why we got into this business. All these big, exciting projects are either moving to PoS like ethereum or launching with PoS like Cardano.”            Cardano as a test case    Cardano is a running test case of the viability of PoS systems for a global audience. Hoskinson, himself one of the initial co-founders of ethereum, said the past two years of “research and engineering” have all been leading to this point.      Rather than relying on external computational cost and energy to power the network, as with PoW, PoS systems rely on internal incentive mechanisms to encourage user participation.      Coordinating the right amount of network rewards versus penalties to keep a PoS blockchain running smoothly and securely has taken years of academic research to get right, Hoskinson says.      Speaking to Cardano’s long roadmap, Kathleen Breitman, co-creator of public PoS blockchain Tezos, said:      “I can tell you for a fact it’s extremely unromantic and extremely unpleasant to watch a proof-of-stake network evolve. … It’s an extraordinarily hard task to switch to a PoS network or to launch a PoS network. The reason why is because there’s so much more coordination cost, more than anything else. It’s not a trivial task.”              Soon after the Shelley upgrade, Cardano plans to add smart contract functionality enabling decentralized applications (a development phase it calls ""Goguen""). Following that, it hopes to increase scalability (the ""Basho"" phase) enabling upwards of 10,000 transactions per second. Ethereum, in contrast, presently processes about 15 transactions per second. Full development of the Cardano platform from Shelley to Basho, and an additional phase dubbed “Voltaire,” which is dedicated to on-chain governance, is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.    The challenges    Cardano raised $63 million dollars in an ICO in early 2017. Then, in 2018, Hoskinson told CoinDesk IOHK had earned “nine figures” in revenue acquiring new corporate and government partnerships for the Cardano blockchain. The most recent corporate partnership with sneaker manufacturer New Balance was announced last month during the annual Cardano Summit.      Hoskinson is constantly on the move, flights between locations and projects. Hoskinson says he travels between 200 and 250 days a year. As well as Goguen, Shelley and Basho, his company IOHK is also developing an enterprise blockchain solution (Atala). Hoskinson is more focused on the developing world than most crypto executives, piloting projects in Mongolia, Rwanda, Ethiopia and elsewhere.      Hoskinson has grown his team of two in 2015 to now 200 contractors and employees worldwide. Hoskinson is confident IOHK has amassed the technical know-how to bring the full Cardano project to full fruition.    Bob Summerwill, executive director of the Ethereum Classic Cooperative, called it a “world-class development team” with a strong focus on academic peer review.Though Buterin and Hoskinson spar over the particulars of their PoS projects, Summerwill told CoinDesk personal rivalries distract from the fundamental similarities between Cardano and ethereum, which he described as “sibling projects with a lot of common genetics.""    As well as technical challenges, Hoskinson will have to stay in good stead with his project partners, something he has not always been good at.      Hoskinson was an original member of the ethereum founding team until June 2014 but was asked to leave the project. Hoskinson wanted a corporate structure for ethereum while Buterin favored a foundation.      Hoskinson also fell out with the Cardano Foundation, which was set up as part of the initial five-year contract to build the blockchain, signed with a group of Japanese businessmen in 2015. The independent nonprofit was set to manage community growth until 2018 but saw a power struggle between Hoskinson the foundation, leading the nonprofit to adopt leadership from Hoskinson’s pool of business partners.      If Hoskinson succeeds, he will need to keep everyone happy and probably for a significant amount of time. Pulling off such a complicated set of projects, making PoS work, and solving the governance challenges will probably take years. 2020 will be just the start.
