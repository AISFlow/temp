42399600,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjt1D,1486594805,You Can Now Bet Bitcoin on Whether the Winklevoss ETF Will Go Live,"A new prediction market is targeting one of the industry's biggest unanswered questions.  Announced today, leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX has launched a prediction futures contract that it says will allow traders to bet on whether the SEC will approve the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, the long-awaited US public investment vehicle that would offer exposure to the digital currency.  The Hong-Kong based exchange has made this market available at a time when the speculation surrounding the potential approval of this bitcoin ETF has generated significant visibility.  First filed in 2014 by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the SEC has repeatedly kicked the can down the road on a decision about its launch, a move that has set up its final deadline on 11th March.  While the Winklevoss twins have already addressed many of the potential risks identified by the SEC, some believe the government agency could reject the proposed fund, though reasons vary.  Perhaps most interestingly, however, the offering is a bit of an all or nothing bet for traders.  BitMEX's COIN futures contract is binary, meaning that it will settle at 100 if the SEC gives the proposed fund a green light and zero if the government agency decides to either postpone its decision or reject the proposed fund.

Project founder Zooko Wilcox took to the zcash forums earlier today to detail what appears to have been an issue tied to an older version of the anonymous cryptocurrency’s software. The move came after F2Pool founder Wang Chun first reported the problem on Github.  While initially suspected to be a chain fork – in which nodes on the network diverge into more than one transaction history – zcash team members later identified a bug in an older release that was addressed in an update published in November as the culprit. Nodes that haven't updated “just stop and refuse to follow any chain after they see the triggering block”, Wilcox wrote.  Wilcox went on to advise users to update to the latest release in order to avoid any potential problems.  The zcash team is planning to release more analysis of the bug, according to team member Sean Bowe.  “I will do a more detailed analysis of the cause, whether or not there was a sustained fork, etc. as soon as possible. I believe there wasn't a chain fork,” Bowe wrote. “Based on the nature of the bug, nodes that encounter the problem should just stall and fail to process new blocks. Indeed, this is how we discovered the bug in the first place.”  The bug also appears to have impacted the price of the anonymous cryptocurrency, according to data from Poloniex. Prices slid to a low of $33, and are down overall roughly 2.5% in the past 24 hours.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash Company.

42399598,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjszF,1486579050,The Swedish Telecom That Bought KnC is Now Mining Bitcoin,"Months after acquiring bankrupt bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner, a Sweden-based company has started to mine.  GoGreenLight moved to buy out the miner last summer, a move that followed KnC’s bankruptcy declaration in May. GoGreenLight is a sister company of Borderlight, an IT and telecom services provider based in Uppsala.  The bankruptcy bid preceded a drop in the amount of bitcoins created with each new transaction block, from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive, competitive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain. That network change took place last July.  According to statements from the company and network data, GoGreenLight has begun activating the KnC hardware it obtained.  Borderlight’s Sten Oscarsson said that the firm was in the midst of restarting the KnC hardware, with 25 people involved in the process. He added that the mine is being enhanced with improved tech for cooling and maintenance.  Oscarsson went on to say:  “[The] next phase with production of new equipment and new designs will start shortly.”  The firm has mined six blocks since 2nd February, according to data from wallet provider Blockchain, with the most recent being struck on 7th February.  GoGreenLight accounted for 0.6% of the total bitcoin network hashrate over the past 24 hours, the data further shows.

42399599,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjt2C,1486574099,India's Biggest Stock Exchange is Testing Blockchain KYC,"India’s biggest stock exchange and a group of domestic banks recently collaborated on a know-your-customer data trial involving blockchain.  The test involved the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE), ICICI Bank, IDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank and RBL Bank, as well as HDFC Securities, a Mumbai-based brokerage. Blockchain startup Elemential provided the technology for the trial.  The test, the first stage of which was completed in January, is the latest and perhaps most significant for India’s finance space to date.  2016 saw a number of institutions within the country testing blockchain. And in recent weeks, other financial firms in India have begun exploring use cases and developing applications of their own. The NSE has been testing the tech since as early as September, according to past reports.  The test centered around a shared environment in which the stock exchange would onboard customer data, allowing the banks – and any regulators that have a window into the platform – to access this information in real-time.  Inside the test  NSE isn’t alone among stock exchanges worldwide in its blockchain experimentation. From Hong Kong to Abu Dhabi, bourses have been experimenting with various uses cases, particularly on the e-voting front. A recent patent application from Nasdaq suggests the exchange operator is exploring how to backup data using the tech.  In a way, the trial in India offers a window into how those institutions are looking to put the tech to work.  According to sources close to the test, those involved spent some time testing the system for resiliency. Simply put, the stakeholders attacked their own blockchain.  Perhaps notably, the steps taken by the companies represents the first iteration of what will be future testing of the KYC solution.  The next step will involve the use of real customer data – a key milestone before any kind of real-world use.

42399593,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjsvJ,1486571608,Accenture Unveils Hardware Solution for Blockchain Private Keys,"Accenture has debuted a new blockchain-focused hardware solution for storing private keys.  The professional services firm partnered with Thales, a French company that works in the fields of cyber security, aerospace and defense, to develop the solution.  It relies on hardware security modules (HSMs) to store the private keys – pieces of digital information that are used to sign blockchain transactions – in a bid to shore up security around enterprise-facing blockchains. Specifically, the Accenture solution relies on the nShield HSM product developed by Thales.  In statements, Accenture representatives pointed to the new offering as a path forward for banks and other financial institutions that want to use the tech but have thus far steered clear due to security concerns.  Simon Whitehouse, senior managing director and head of blockchain technologies at Accenture, said in a statement:  ""Our solution provides the physical security that banks have relied on for decades to keep money and transaction records safe from cyberthieves. It will clear a wider path not only for banks but for governments, insurers, healthcare providers and others to do real-world deployments of blockchain technology.""  Notably, the solution could alleviate some concerns among regulators who have thus far cited security as an impediment to wider adoption, most recently the European Securities and Markets Authority, or ESMA.  In a report published yesterday, ESMA said that, after a year and a half of investigation, it would not propose new rules for blockchain use within Europe, calling such a move “premature”. That said, it highlighted private key security as an existing issue.  ""Importantly, ESMA sees the security of private keys as paramount in a DLT context, as lost or stolen keys might easily be used for illicit purposes,"" the agency wrote.

42399597,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjt0E,1486563936,IBM's Biggest-Ever Blockchain Trade Finance Trial Could Go Global,"Two government agencies funded IBM's latest blockchain implementation, the largest ever in terms of parties involved and arguably one of the more impressive in the sophistication of the offering.  With support from both Dubai Customs and Dubai Trade, IBM has so far courted a telecommunications service provider, a letter of credit issuing bank, a responding bank, a freight company and an airline in a trial centered on what major financial firms believe is one of the tech's most promising use cases.  Once the all-inclusive supply chain and trade finance proof-of-concept is completed, it will be integrated with Watson's AI, making it one of IBM's most pervasive blockchain projects to date.  But while all this is exciting, it's what happens once the various players begin to implement the results of the test in other countries around the world that will truly set the project apart.  According to James Wallis, IBM's vice president for blockchain markets and engagements, the real value derived from such a large-scale project is developing the ability to communicate across different nations and multiple industries to achieve a common goal.  Wallis, who helped coordinate the massive, multi-party collaboration, told CoinDesk:  ""We don't know exactly where it's going to end up, but the collaboration across different government entities around the world is going to have to happen.""  Serious progress  Unveiled yesterday, the proof-of-concept is being designed to track the shipment of fruit from India via a cargo ship to Dubai. Once in Dubai, the fruit will be turned into juice and exported to Spain via airplane, as just one example.  To move the required transactions for the simple-sounding shipment to a blockchain, the Dubai government also ""sponsored"" the participation of UAE-based telecommunications service Du to track data via Internet of Things-enabled devices.  Emirates NBD Bank will then issue letters of credit, Spanish bank, Santander will receive the letters, freight company Aramex will ship the fruit overseas and an unnamed airline carrier will transport the juice.  The POC is expected to be powered by self-executing code, or smart contracts, on the open-source Hyperledger platform, with data reported via Du's Internet of Things devices being validated by IBM’s Watson artificial intelligence.  The combined trade-finance and supply-chain proof-of concept is not a ""legal construct"" according to Wallis, but rather a group of companies that have agreed to work together under the sponsorship of the Dubai government.  While IBM is not making public the timeline on which the objectives are expected to be deliverable, the Dubai government last October declared it would have all government documents moved to a blockchain by 2020.  ""That means some serious progress needs to be made this year,"" Wallis said.  Countdown to blockchain  But the sense of urgency felt by Wallis isn't unique in the blockchain industry.  Industries as diverse as finance, automobile, supply chain and health insurance built hundreds of proofs-of-concept last year to demonstrate value to both investors and clients alike.  In October, IBM announced its own supply-chain pilot built for Walmart to move part of China's pork industry to another implementation of the Hyperledger blockchain. Just a week later Walmart told CoinDesk it was exploring implementing blockchain for additional products.  Around the world, separate supply chain POCs have been built by various companies in India, Singapore and Australia, just to name few.  Evidence of the increasing sophistication of the endeavors can be seen in, Hijro, formerly called Fluent, raising $1.65m to help integrate blockchain into companies’ existing infrastructure, and Microsoft, which last month launched its Project Manifest global initiative to help connect supply chains.  In total, as many as 400 blockchain proofs-of-concept had been built around the world in 2016, according to an executive speaking at the launch of consulting firm Deloitte’s blockchain lab in New York City earlier this month. Days later, an executive at the firm called 2017 a ""make or break year"" for the industry.  Increasing complexity  But not everyone agreed.  Wallis positions the multi-nation, cross-industry proof-of-concept as part of a new caliber of blockchain experiments that will help jump-start the process of integrating distributed ledgers globally.  Last week, IBM published a report based on surveys of 200 government executives finding that nine out of 10 respondents believed their governments were likely to fund blockchain projects in a wide range of industries by the end of 2018.  According to Wallis the main goal of the Dubai proof-of-concept is to ""figure out"" how international customs agencies can better communicate with trade organizations to build their existing services into a shared, distributed ledger.  Wallis concluded:  ""This is a proof-of-concept, but I would say this one is of the most significant ones, if not the most significant one we’ve been involved in, because of the number of players and the whole flow, both import and export.""

Following a statement last year by the Bank of Japan’s governor Haruhiko Kuroda, that the the bank was ""test driving"" distributed ledger technology, the bank's head of payments has now clarified the research.  Masafumi Miya, who also oversees the bank’s fintech center, told CoinDesk:  ""These trials by the bank's staff simply aim to understand the mechanics of DLT, rather than applying it to the bank's own liabilities or its payment and settlement systems.""  Further, Miya confirmed that the ""main findings"" of a joint research project between the Bank of Japan’s Settlement Systems Department and the European Central Bank are expected to be released before the end of the year.  During governor Kuroda’s comments in December, he told attendees at the Paris Europlace Financial Forum in Tokyo that other central banks around the world should engage in similar research efforts.  Since last year, Japan’s financial technology developers and other market participants have been working to chart a course for the country to take a leadership role on the global blockchain scene.

42399602,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjt59,1486550666,What Makes Bitcoin Great? One Scientist is On a Quest to Find Out,"Visa, PayPal, bitcoin. The last, it seems, is not like the others.  You might be thinking, well, of course. It's unique compared to older institutions, ones that first made digital currency possible by storing payment data in centralized databases.  But, that might be only one way of looking at it.  Computer scientists and developers are quick to note that the reason bitcoin has succeeded at decentralizing its monetary system is because it improves on past computer consensus protocols, a point that Cornell associate professor Elaine Shi stressed in her presentation at the recent Stanford blockchain security conference.  Even after 30 years of research, Shi explained, classical consensus protocols fail under certain conditions. But she believes bitcoin is different because it's more ""robust"".  However, defining and mathematically spelling out these differences isn't so easy to do.  Shi told CoinDesk:  ""The protocol's success is kind of ahead of the scientific understanding.""  Despite the challenge, the academic seems determined to catch up.  Sitting in the cold after a long day of security presentations, she chatted excitedly about bitcoin's unique properties.  She noted that other recent research has sought to develop a formal security proof for bitcoin, and that thinkers from IC3 and elsewhere are now looking to help flag potential vulnerabilities and to inform future research into the protocol.  Initial excitement  Shi's curiosity was first piqued in 2010 or 2011 while she was working for the technology company Xerox PARC in Palo Alto.  It was then that her friend, a hobbyist and miner, showed her the bitcoin white paper. They read through it together, fascinated.  ""We tried to understand why bitcoin took off,"" she said.  From her point of view, it was a big deal that the currency saw so much use compared to ecash, a technology put into the world by long-time cryptographer David Chaum in the mid-1990s.  ""At that time, they adopted more sophisticated crypto. But there wasn’t so much traction,"" she said.  She added that she was impressed that bitcoin, in contrast, saw more rapid adoption and uses simple cryptography – public key encryption, signatures and hash functions.  ""One big thing for bitcoin was that it made the incentives right. It gave incentives to early adopters. There are various other aspects that maybe it did right in terms of incentives and possibly helped with adoption and how it gained popularity,"" she added.  Sleepy consensus  Later on, Shi moved to University of Maryland, where she continued her bitcoin research, and then to Cornell’s Initiative For CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3), the university's center for study on all things blockchain.  Her presentation at Stanford, ""Rethinking Large-Scale Consensus,"" discussed her new research, aimed at rethinking how bitcoin might work differently, but retain its unique properties. The result is her proposed 'sleepy' model of consensus.  She noted that when she asked why people were exploring the use of a blockchain rather than a long-studied classical protocol, such as PBFT, people would typically respond ""because it’s more robust"".  This is the common wisdom. But, she noted that from an academic perspective, it’s been difficult to even define what 'robust' means exactly.  In this light, 'sleepy consensus' explores a specific piece of bitcoin's robustness: sporadic participation, where nodes can leave and enter the system as they please. It further examines whether a system can be as robust without proof-of-work, the algorithm that leads to one agreed-upon transaction history  In Shi's model, there are 'sleepy' nodes (that are offline) and 'awake' nodes (that are online and active).  Shi displayed images of Snow White to show each state, and to demonstrate that that nodes can shift between these two states.  ""For example, when the prince kisses Snow White, she wakes up and continues to participate,"" she said. ""Snow White is a very robust princess.""  One way to test the robustness of the system is to see whether it can come to agreement when 51% of the online nodes are 'honest' (and therefore will not accept an invalid transaction), even with this property of sporadic participation.  Classical models fail here. In fact, Shi went as far as to say that no classical protocol, whether synchronous or asynchronous, holds up. Not even when 99% of the online nodes are honest.  She concluded that bitcoin, as conventional wisdom says, is indeed robust. It’s a system that’s been up and running for eight years, and that continues to work as long as 51% of nodes are honest.  'Sleepy' consensus builds on that robustness, but rearranges the protocol in a way that ditches bitcoin’s proof-of-work.  The research team found that the tweaked system was more robust in some ways, but with the new construction, new security problems also sprung up.  Work is ongoing here, and Shi said that, for now, the protocol is suitable for consortium blockchains along the lines of those released by the Linux-led Hyperledger.  Though, again, there are perhaps other elements to bitcoin's 'robustness'.  Another project from Shi and IC3, FruitChains, explores bitcoin’s game theoretical component, or how it incentivizes participants to act in a way that ultimately benefits everyone.  The result of the research is a proposal for a 'fair blockchain', where block rewards and transaction fees are evenly distributed and there's less variance in rewards.  Analyzing each piece on its own could lead to something bigger.  ""In general, we need a new scientific foundation for all of this,"" Shi said.  Unexpected directions  Yet, Shi emphasized that this research is not about defining things just for the sake of academic curiosity.  Once people understand the protocols better, there are different, perhaps unexpected, directions to go. Broadly, researchers will have a better understanding of how public blockchains can be improved.  Proof-of-work is expensive, for example, as powerful computers from around the world are currently hashing puzzles at dizzying rates to secure blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum. Many researchers, such as those working on proof-of-stake for ethereum, are trying to develop a way around these massive electricity demands.  More research could help determine whether or not those efforts are in vain.  Furthermore, Shi argues that it’s important to work on understanding the security of the protocol, and writing up mathematical proofs that could potentially bring to light hidden protocol flaws.  “People have somehow developed these very nice intuitions, but it’s still very, very difficult to like design a provably correct protocol. That’s very, very important when you’re dealing with something like cryptocurrency, because if the protocol is broken then your money is at stake,” she said.  A 'provably correct' protocol, on the other hand, is one that satisfies certain mathematical requirements.  She mentioned that such a protocol could help ward off future situations along the lines of The DAO – the ethereum project that ended in failure.  “It’s very easy to make a mistake unless you go through this whole process,” she said. “I think that both in academia and in industry there’s this huge need for these protocols, including both consensus and cryptography.”  She also argued that smart contracts require more advanced cryptography protocols.  “IC3 would like to help make these secure by constructing protocols. And deploy them in the real world,” she added.  Combining disciplines  Beyond all that, Shi has other research ideas.  One potential project is to design a programming language that would let coders with little knowledge of cryptography create more secure apps. Programmers could state vaguely what security properties they need, and the programming language itself would decide what consensus protocol would be best used under the hood.  To Shi, the ability to combine disciplines in such a way is partly what's so exciting. And, bitcoin is a rich area to experiment with cryptography in particular, she said.  She concluded:  ""This is like the goldmine of problems.""
