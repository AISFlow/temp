42425982,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRth,1407790847,Payza Introduces Bitcoin Buying Option in 190 Countries,"Global online payment processor Payza has announced it is now offering customers in 190 countries the ability to buy bitcoin via bank transfer.  Payza took to its official bloghttps://blog.payza.com/payza-updates/why-use-payza-announcements/buy-bitcoin-with-payza/ to reveal the news, though this formal announcement followed preliminary tweets from both Payza business development consultant Charlie Shrem and the London and Montreal-based company itself.  In its formal remarks, Payza hinted that the bitcoin buying option will allow it to pursue larger goals in the bitcoin and digital currency space, stating:  ""This is our first step into the exciting space of cryptocurrency, currency that exists solely in the digital world. At Payza, we’re very interested in bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and we have big plans to expand the way bitcoin can be used on our platform.""  Payza first detailed its plans in the digital currency space in a May blog posthttps://blog.payza.com/payza-updates/announcements/payza-exploring-options-bitcoin/ that discussed bitcoin's potential as a payments tool. This interest was further made evident in July, when Payza confirmed rumors to the The Wall Street Journal that Shrem was serving the company in an advisory role.    #Bitcoin has arrived! More on the #Payza blog: Buy Bitcoin with Payza: Introducing Withdrawal by Bitcoin https://t.co/wdfzIAFVZT      — Payza News (@Payzaofficial) August 11, 2014      Targeting merchants  Speaking to CoinDesk, Shrem elaborated on Payza's goals, suggesting that the company's biggest opportunities may be in catering to bitcoin's merchant space.  He explained that, unlike popular alternatives such as BitPay and Coinbase, Payza could become a one-stop solution for new merchants that want to capitalize on bitcoin but offer multiple payment methods.  ""[Payza will] be the only company where if a merchant actually wants to accept both credit card and bitcoin, they only need to work with one company,"" he said.  Shrem indicated that Payza does not charge users to deposit funds into their accounts, but that a 2% charge for users who buy bitcoin via the platform applies. Buyers lock in the price of bitcoin upon purchase, however, the withdrawal process can be expected to take up to three days.  Given that users are not charged to send funds through Payza, Shrem also remarked that the offering could position the company to become a player in the remittance space, adding:  ""[We're] drastically bringing down the price of remittances – 2% total end-to-end. We're going to be adding the ability to send deposit in bitcoin as well, so you can move bitcoin between accounts and it won't cost anything.""  Refining the product  As for why the product took some time to reach market, Shrem attributed the somewhat lengthy process to Payza's desire to ensure its first offering was ready for bitcoin consumers.  Shrem pointed out that Payza decided on five phases for the rollout, and that in addition to the development work, phases included training customer service and securing support from banking partners.  He said many of these considerations were the product of Payza's near-decade of experience in the payment industry, working with both regulators and its banking partners.  Shrem explained:  ""Payza has very good relationships with regulators already [...] With bitcoin companies [...] they don't have compliance officers, they're kind of new to the scene, they don't know what's going on. With Payza, it's kind of refreshing for me because I'm used to working with startups, working with a company like them is very organic and it's a lot easier to get things done.""  Creating an account  Larger goals aside, Payza has also given consumers a first look at how its new offering will look, and what it will require from bitcoin buyers.  To create an account, users first select the country in which they reside before then electing to open a personal or business account.  Both accounts allow users to collect payments, exchange currencies and make payments via the platform.  Users then provide their first and last name, email address and create a password before validating their email.  To transact, Payza users need to then complete their profile with the service, providing information such as their job title, industry of work and Social Security number.  Then, users input their address, phone number and create security questions to ensure the safety of their account.  Called the 'Withdraw Funds by Bitcoin' feature, Payza boasts that verified users can buy bitcoin in three steps: withdrawing funds, verifying the currency and confirming the transaction.  To start this process, users click on the 'Withdraw Funds' button on the top corner of their account screen. Next they select 'Bitcoin' from a list of available options that includes bank transfer, bank wire and credit card.  Finally, Payza customers enter the amount of funds they want to withdraw. Users must withdraw a minimum of $20 to complete their order.

42425978,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRjh,1407786637,Barry Silbert Leads $250k Investment in Indian Bitcoin Startup Unocoin,"Bitcoin exchange and merchant payment processor Unocoin has closed a $250,000 funding deal with Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Corp.  The Bangalore-based company has come a long way since launching in December 2013. After dealing with initial uncertainty surrounding local regulation of digital currency businesses, it has grown into one of India's most popular bitcoin gateways.  Silbert told CoinDesk:  ""I believe that Unocoin has the potential to become the leading bitcoin company in India for buying, selling and storing bitcoin, as well as merchant processing. As an early investor in BitPay and Coinbase, I saw first hand how first-mover advantage, coupled with a great team, can lead to market dominance.""  Unocoin's managing director Sathvik Vishwanath told CoinDesk that Silbert had approached the company in its first few months of operation.  He said:  ""The investment and backing from the 'Bitcoin Hero’ has brought both [...] cheer and responsibility to our team. A good part of the investment will be spent on scaling up Unocoin and its marketing efforts, while another part will be used towards regulatory compliance and security expenditures.""  Unocoin's new services  Vishwanath continued:  ""We believe our hard work is starting to pay off [...] I can say we are processing 10 times the user verifications per day than [...] just 2 months ago.""  The company launched its new Unocoin Merchant Gateway service in June for businesses, traders, e-commerce shops and freelancers as a fast and easy way to accept bitcoin payments. It does not currently charge its users any fees.  Merchants using the service can also request for the bitcoin they receive to be instantly exchanged into Indian Rupees (INR) and transferred to their bank account within three days.  Role in growing bitcoin adoption  According to global business development manager Vikram Nikkam, Unocoin is currently in talks with a number of online vendors and international payment network ZipZap to explore potential collaborations.    Unocoin and ZipZap testing global possibilities with Bitcoin @unocoin @AlanSafahi @manishchawla65 #india #remittance      – Unocoin (@unocoin) 10 Aug 2014    Nikkam added that Unocoin was also looking at India's massive overseas remittance market, which transmitted $67.6bn back to the country between 2012 and 2013. An estimated 25 million people of Indian descent or nationality live in other countries around the world, mostly in the Middle East.  ""Bitcoin adoption in India among merchants is still in its nascent stage but we are going all out to change that. The future looks promising.""  Silbert's path to bitcoin venture capitalist  Barry Silbert, a bitcoin investment pioneer through SecondMarket, left his founding position as CEO at the company in July to focus all his energies on the business' digital currency side.  He has remained CEO of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) and is has invested in over 30 companies through his VC vehicle Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, across a variety of industries and countries.  As well as BitPay and Coinbase, those companies include Kraken, Safello, BitGo, Ripple Labs, Korbit, Gyft and Xapo.  Bitcoin's massive potential in India  India's authorities were hesitant at first to accept bitcoin businesses but, after liaising with representatives from the industry, they have adopted a far softer approach.  The country is often flagged as one of the key emerging economies with most potential for digital currency-related growth. With a population of 1.2 billion people, a large percentage of whom have little to no access to traditional banking, India has a growing number of bitcoin exchanges and services.  Nikkam added that bitcoin meetups in Bangalore are now routinely full-house events that attract members with advanced cryptocurrency knowledge alongside some novel ideas. The industry is determined to conduct itself openly and ethically, he said.  ""With the community growing we also stress the importance of clean trade and self regulation.""

42425963,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRNh,1407778013,US CFPB Now Accepting Complaints Against Bitcoin Businesses,"The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has issued a new warning to consumers, advising that they should exercise caution when engaging with the bitcoin and digital currency markets.  The CFPB advisory urges consumers to be vigilant as there are risks to consider when dealing and transacting with digital currency; namely, volatile exchange rates, unclear costs, security threats posed by hackers and scammers and the possibility that companies may not always be able to provide help or refunds for lost or stolen funds.  Notably, the news comes two months after the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of the US Congress, asked the CFPB to look more closely at the digital currency industry.  CFPB director Richard Cordray echoed the agency’s emphasis on the risk posed by digital currencies in his remarks, adding:  “Virtual currencies may have potential benefits, but consumers need to be cautious and they need to be asking the right questions. Virtual currencies are not backed by any government or central bank, and at this point consumers are stepping into the Wild West when they engage in the market.”  The document offers introductions to the products and services offered by digital currency companies – like private keys and wallets – and mentions the risks each carry.  Filing complaints with the CFPB  The CFPB is an independent federal agency responsible for policing financial products and services. When it issued the advisory, it announced that it is currently accepting complaints from users about products and services in the digital currency market.  The agency also lined its advisory with anecdotal complaints it has received thus far.  For example, some individuals have told the CFPB they have been unable to recover lost or stolen funds from exchanges; one user had to discard hard drive that held the private keys to 7,500 BTC; and one sent digital currency without ever hearing back from the other person involved in the trade.  The invitation for consumer complaints marks the first time the agency has commented on the bitcoin industry, and indicates what could be the first step in its more close examination of the digital currency market.  The CFPB will use the information it collects to better understand how digital currencies affect consumers and help it enforce federal consumer financial laws and take consumer protection policy steps, if needed.  Bitcoin businesses react  Initial industry reaction to the release was mixed, with some prominent members of the community attempting to highlight how the statement could increase consumer awareness.  Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of New York-based bitcoin exchange Coinsetter, spoke to the report’s positive points. Users of digital currency products and services should be asking themselves about product benefits, security procedures and pricing, he said:  “The CFPB’s bulletin provides a comprehensive list of the risks associated with bitcoin, and I encourage anyone who is not already familiar with them to read it. Not covered in the CFPB’s letter are the many benefits to using bitcoin, including the fact that it is a low cost alternative to banking for underprivileged families.”  Other notable community members had markedly different reactions.  For example, New York business attorney and chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s Regulatory Affairs Committee Marco Santori implied on Twitter today that the CFPB’s warning presents a biased approach to digital currency basics.    .@CFPB publishes #bitcoin consumer alert. Not a single positive word on benefits to consumer financial privacy. http://t.co/B20eSqasQ6      — Marco Santori (@msantoriESQ) August 11, 2014    Likewise, Coinbase founder Fred Ehrsam called the report “disappointing” for its one-sided presentation.    Disappointing report from the @CFPB. It's their job to disclose all risks, but this reads like a wall of text of FUD: http://t.co/coe3qIFSoo      — Fred Ehrsam (@FEhrsam) August 11, 2014    Industry advocates call for action  The response from bitcoin's leading advocacy groups was more measured, even if they found the release to be a clear sign that bitcoin needs their further support.  Perianne Boring, president of the newly formed bitcoin advocacy group, the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said the release as evidence of why further bitcoin education in Washington, DC is badly needed.  Boring told CoinDesk:  ""On the heels of NYDFS's proposed BitLicense regulatory scheme, this is yet another example of why the Chamber of Digital Commerce was formed – to help educate federal (and, when warranted, other) regulators and policy makers and guide them into smart regulation. This advisory confirms that there is real urgency for the sector to support the work of the Chamber. There is abundant evidence that our concern is in no way alarmist.""  Jim Harper, Bitcoin Foundation global policy counsel, also cited education in his remarks, telling CoinDesk:  “It is standard practice for agencies at the state, federal, and international levels to issue warnings about bitcoin. There are consumer risks around new technologies, and even-keeled educational material from government agencies can help make consumers aware and savvy.”  The government’s ill-defined role in regulating bitcoin enterprises has become a contentious debate in the bitcoin community lately. Though some argue that having a consumer protection framework for digital currency businesses might stifle innovation in the space, others say it could be very advantageous bringing about mainstream interest more quickly.

42425971,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhRdh,1407762824,Mexican Bitcoin Exchange Bitso Launches 10% Referral Bonus,"Mexican bitcoin exchange Bitso has exited beta with a number of initiatives aiming to attract new users in the country.  The company first went live in April as the first exchange aimed at Mexico's burgeoning bitcoin ecosystem, with features designed specifically for locals.  “As we are not a ‘cookie cutter’ exchange, we're really able to offer services tailored to the particular needs of the Mexican market,” Bitso chief technology officer Ben Peters told CoinDesk.  For instance, the exchange is fully integrated with Compropago, a local payments service that allows Bitso users to fund their account with cash at over 130,000 terminals across Mexico, including some 7-Elevens and Walmarts.  As for its exit points, Bitso will charge 1% commission on all trades – previously free in beta. Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, Mexican peso withdrawals by SPEI transfer and use of the platform's Ripple gateway will remain free.  Most exciting to the team is Bitso's new referral program, which pays users 10% of the trade commission generated by each new customer they bring to the platform.  Peters said:  “The market in Mexico is still very nascent, and so we’re doing everything we can do encourage participation. The referral scheme is a terrific way to directly involve our regular users in promoting this new economy in an inclusive way.”  Mexico's Ripple gateway  Peters said the company aims to boost Mexican interest in the fundamental benefits that cryptocurrency systems – not just bitcoin – can bring to the country.  “Our vision is to help Mexicans harness these technologies in ways that can make a profound difference to their lives,” he explained.  The platform is the first and only Ripple gateway in Mexico.  According to chief executive Pablo Gonzalez, Bitso's partners see a symbiotic relationship between its Ripple Gateway and its bitcoin exchange, focusing on the value proposition the Ripple network offers outside its native currency, ripple (XRP).  He told CoinDesk:  “This is something we've found extremely helpful for bringing bitcoin liquidity to the Mexican market as it allows our market makers to quickly move in and out of Bitso.”  Playing for the same team  As the first Mexican bitcoin exchange, Gonzalez said he and his team have benefitted greatly from their first-mover advantage over the last four months.  Upon mentioning the progress of bitcoin exchanges MexBT and Unisend, alongside brokers Volabit and CoinBatch, he added that Bitso doesn’t view the other players in Mexico’s bitcoin economy as opponents:  “We are very glad to see these companies in Mexico as they cater to first-time bitcoin users, which helps grow bitcoin adoption in Mexico. We are looking forward to working with these companies in future.”  Gonzalez reiterated the company’s intent to educate people on cryptocurrencies and help them access the relevant tools that can help grow the crypto-economy.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/11/mexican-bitcoin-exchange-bitso-launches-10-referral-bonus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f32fdf2ce0843f71c32f46391c75609a42cd1215-1207x534.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company tweeted the latest milestone late Sunday night, cementing its position as the world’s most popular bitcoin wallet provider.    Here's to Two Million #Blockchain wallets, millions more, & putting #bitcoin in everyone's hands! https://t.co/ZxHfIuom8u      — Blockchain.info (@blockchain) August 10, 2014      Peter Smith, Blockchain's COO, said:  ""Being the first bitcoin company to reach two million wallets is an exceptional honour [...] The endorsement of the now millions of bitcoiners who have chosen to use our wallet is a distinction that truly humbles us as a team.""  Smith added that strong growth coupled with price stability is an indicator that the industry is moving towards a ""transactions paradigm.""  Indeed, the company has witnessed rapid expansion in recent months.  Back in January 2013, Blockchain boasted more than 100,000 wallet users. The 500,000th wallet was created in late October and the company rewarded the lucky user of its 500,000th wallet with 10 BTC.  Blockchain passed the one million mark in January 2014 and by April it had about 1.5 million wallets. In other words, the organisation has doubled its wallet downloads in roughly six months.  Smith pointed out that downloads ""exploded"" in July, after its iOS wallet was re-launched and made available on the Apple App Store. Earlier this summer, the company also updated its Android wallet with a number of merchant-friendly features.  The competition  Blockchain is not the only bitcoin company to boast such figures. Back in February, San Francisco-based wallet provider and payments processor Coinbase entered six-digit territory and announced that it had more than a million wallets. The company had started with just 13,000 wallets in early 2013.  Bitcoin wallet provider MultiBit also passed the one million mark in March 2014. However, MultiBit cautioned that the statistics were not complete, as data on early adopter downloads dating back to 2011 was lost.  There is, however, an important caveat. A significant number of downloaded and installed wallets does not necessarily translate into active bitcoin users.  Wallets are frequently downloaded by people with a casual interest in bitcoin, which means a large number are inactive or abandoned. Blockchain.info charts shed more light on bitcoin user statistics, but it is still difficult to say how many truly active wallets are out there and how many have been abandoned.  Blockchain told CoinDesk that it is currently handling tens of thousands of transactions every day. An estimated $22bn in bitcoin transactions were made using Blockchain software so far.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/11/blockchain-passes-2-million-bitcoin-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5a83c87c567f34e1f69578f8b45b08e929cba2c-1280x618.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dell is by far the largest enterprise accepting bitcoin in the world at this point, with $57bn in annual revenue. The previous record holder was DISH Network, with roughly 25% of Dell's income.  The Texas-based computer hardware giant also marked its digital currency debut with a 10% discount for anyone purchasing its gaming-oriented Alienware machines with bitcoin. The company accepts bitcoin payments for US customers on any item on its Dell.com store site.  Dell's CIO Paul Walsh hinted last month that Dell may pursue more extensive involvement in the bitcoin space, adding that accepting bitcoin was part of the company's overall plan to align itself with technological innovation.
