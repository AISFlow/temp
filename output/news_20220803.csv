42374110,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXhzN,1659570820,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Extends Losing Streak as Pelosi Taiwan Trip Passes Without Incident,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin extends losing streak, while Solana's SOL token slides after hack that drained crypto wallets.  Insights: Risks posed by this week's visit to Taiwan by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi failed to materialize – at least in the eyes of the bitcoin market, Sam Reynolds reports.  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $22,807 −1.1%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,614 −2.0%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,155.17 +1.6%      ●Gold: $1,781 per troy ounce +0.5%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.75% +0.007       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Bitcoin Extends Losing Streak to Six Days  By Helene Braun  Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losing streak to six days, dropping 1% to about $22,800.  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap seemed mostly unfazed by crypto’s latest hack that left over 8,000 wallets, including several Solana (SOL) addresses, compromised on Tuesday.  But Solana's SOL token fell over 4.2% during the past 24 hours and is down 76% year to date. The ninth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap did not break below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) – suggesting that some large Solana holders might still be holding on.  Over the past two weeks, bitcoin seems to have entered a new range, now hovering between $21,200 and $24,400, a step up from the $17,000 to $21,000 range in the weeks before.  “Bitcoin needs a crypto-specific catalyst to trigger a meaningful move above the $24,700 level,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange broker Oanda, wrote Wednesday in an email update.  Read More: Today's Market Wrap by Glenn Williams Jr.  Markets in general seem to have recovered from U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) visit to Taiwan on Tuesday, which caused many investors to stay away from risky assets amid potential U.S.-China tensions.  Ether (ETH) ended the day slightly lower, trading at $1,644.62 at press time.

So Let’s all Calm Down  By Sam Reynolds  Taipei — Tuesday was a fairly normal day in Taiwan. On Kinmen, a group of islands only a few miles from China, “the threat of war is the furthest thing from people's minds,” as one foreign journalist on the island described the local mood in the late afternoon.  On Twitter and most Western media it was something different: Clouds of war were gathering. Beijing was certainly egging on the narrative with displays of military hardware on beaches in Xiamen, a coastal city in China. Censors on Weibo, a local social media platform, who are often quick to erase anything politically sensitive, let the videos remain untouched. They eventually made their way onto YouTube.  After Pelosi landed, Beijing was quick to ""retaliate."" It suspended import licenses for citrus fruit, two types of fish, as well as 100 brands of snacks and confectionaries. They’ve also promised to conduct live fire exercises off of Taiwan’s coast later in the week, but haven’t specified what exactly that would entail.  China's economy  Let’s put this all in context  There’s speculation that, on Beijing’s side, these might be calculated measures to distract the local population from the bleak economic reality unfolding within China.  Four regional banks in-country are reportedly ready to collapse, dragged down by China’s growing debt bubble, the precarious housing market and an industrial slowdown due to its lockdowns and COVID-19 lockdown policies. When one bank refused to accept withdrawal requests, protesters marched on its steps; authorities hired thugs to disperse them and weaponized the protesters’ health QR codes, turning them red, which is an automatic quarantine sentence in state-run facilities.  Blaming Americans for meddling in Taiwan – what China calls its own affairs, governing – is an easy distraction.  Both sides know their limits. After all, China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner, with 40% of its exports going to either China or Hong Kong. Likewise, Taiwan is an important trading partner for China: It's the ninth-largest destination for China’s exports.  Taiwan also conducts its share of military exercises close to China’s coast. Kinmen, a rock of tranquility this week as many in the West thought Pelosi’s impending arrival was the precipice of war, plays host to annual live-fire military exercises that take place only miles from Xiamen.  While China sends aircraft into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone, an area beyond a country’s airspace that’s monitored by the military, it tends to keep its aircraft well away from Taiwan’s actual airspace and doesn’t cross the median line of the Taiwan Strait. In contrast, Taiwan’s air force regularly flies to Kinmen, and its other offshore islands that are past the median line such as Penghu and Matsu.  Taiwan semiconductors  Neither side wants war.  If China really wanted to escalate things, it would use its vast censorship leviathan to wipe Weibo clean of videos of military equipment moving or talk of live-fire exercises off the coast of Taiwan.  It would also seek to ban more significant Taiwanese exports rather than citrus fruits, frozen fish and sweets. Keep in mind that the last agricultural export ban backfired as locals and other nations annoyed with China bought up the Taiwanese fruit destined for China that would otherwise go to waste.  Semiconductors amount to just over 35% of all of Taiwan’s exports, and banning their import to China would significantly hurt the Taiwanese economy.  But at the same time, it would deprive Chinese firms of the advanced chips their electronics industry requires. Its own semiconductor fabrication firms are years behind Taiwan and South Korea because export restrictions first put through by the former Trump administration in the U.S. prevent Chinese firms from getting the tools they need to compete. A semiconductor import ban would do serious harm to the Chinese economy, which is why it's not being considered.  It seems that the most China is able to do is cause annoyances with a cyber campaign and using bots to spread disinformation about missile attacks.  The market has seemed to shake this all off as cooler heads have prevailed. There’s been saber rattling for domestic audiences, but cross-strait business continues to thrive. And that’s not something that will affect the price of bitcoin.

875905,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=497501,1659567629,Why Bitcoin Investors Should Pay Attention To The Macro Environment,"It can no longer be denied that the price of bitcoin is being heavily influenced by the macro environment. The stock market correlation had hit a new all-time high earlier in the year, and the crypto market is yet to decouple from it. Given this, bitcoin investors would do well to react accordingly and pay attention to the stock market for a possible forecast of where the bitcoin price may be headed, and here are some reasons why. Institutional Investors Are Here The call for institutional adoption had been loud throughout the last few years, and these big players had actually begun to move into the market. While this had come with a lot of positives for bitcoin, such as increased demand, it had also inadvertently tied bitcoin&apos;s price to the stock market, which these big players are very visible. The result of this had been a stronger correlation of bitcoin to the trends happening in the stock market. This means that whatever affected the institutional investors in the stock market due to the financial situations had also flowed over into bitcoin. Hence, if the stock market was going down, bitcoin is now more likely to follow it. And what&apos;s more is that bitcoin actually does this with more volatility, causing a larger swing in price compared to the stocks.

42411755,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgiU,1659561984,What Is SushiSwap? How to Get Started on the Crypto Exchange,"As decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to mature into a more inclusive financial system, more and more tools are being developed. If you’re looking to trade crypto using a decentralized exchange (DEX), you have several options on almost every blockchain – and it can be a bit overwhelming to find a place to start.  In this guide, we will explain how to get started with SushiSwap, which has been giving users access to every token within the Ethereum ecosystem since 2020.  What is SushiSwap?  SushiSwap is an Ethereum-blockchain DEX founded by pseudonymous open-source developers Chef Nomi and 0xMaki and initially launched as a copy of Uniswap.  As a clone of Uniswap, SushiSwap was a platform to swap tokens without the need for a middleman or intermediary. To make SushiSwap unique, the founders added new features including liquidity mining and governance through SushiSwap’s SUSHI token.  SUSHI, the native token of the SushiSwap ecosystem, gives users voting power to determine the future of the platform as well as a percentage of trading fees and staking rewards. Though holding SUSHI is not required to use SushiSwap, the token does offer some additional functionality – like staking – on the SushiSwap platform that you can’t access without it.  How SushiSwap works  SushiSwap utilizes a decentralized trading method known as an automated market maker (AMM). Unlike traditional exchanges, which require an order book and intermediary for trading, SushiSwap’s AMM makes the entire process peer-to-peer.  AMMs, like the one used by SushiSwap, don’t need an intermediary or order book because trades are with liquidity pools – funds of a particular token, deposited by users, that utilize smart contracts to provide liquidity for trades.  Read more: Understanding the Technology Behind Decentralized Exchanges  Since the launch of SushiSwap in 2020, the project has continued to develop new DeFi tools and has created a platform no longer just for traders. The SushiSwap ""menu"" of the product has expanded to give users access to yield farming, staking and lending and borrowing, all within the same app.  Getting started with SushiSwap  To get started on SushiSwap, create an Ethereum-based wallet. There are several kinds on the market, and some of the more popular ones include:  MetaMask  Coinbase Wallet  Trust Wallet  Once you have your wallet set up, you’re ready to connect to the SushiSwap decentralized application (dapp). Though not required to get going, you could also get SUSHI tokens either using the DEX or centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase.  What can you do on SushiSwap?  Since SushiSwap launched its DEX, it has grown into a fully decentralized platform, offering a variety of different features and tools for users to invest with. Beyond the SushiSwap DEX, SushiSwap offers several features through its BentoBox dapps including:  SushiSwap Exchange: SushiSwap’s flagship product enables users to swap any ERC-20 token for any other ERC-20 token.  Kashi: This dapp lets users lend and borrow crypto for a variety of different purposes, including leverage trading.  SushiBar: This product lets users stake their tokens.  Become a liquidity provider (LP)  One feature you can quickly get going on is becoming a liquidity provider on SushiSwap. Liquidity providers (LPs) are the users who provide tokens to liquidity pools so the AMM can execute trades. LPs are rewarded for staking their assets in liquidity pools by receiving such benefits as a percentage of trading fees.  Though it seems complex, the smart contract responsible for the liquidity pool is doing most of the work for you. To become an LP and start earning rewards from the SUSHI-ETH liquidity pool, for example, just do the following:  Go to SushiSwap and click on the liquidity tab.  Connect your wallet and select “+ New Position.”  Select an even split of SUSHI and ETH tokens under “Confirm Adding Liquidity” and hit Approve.  Receive your SUSHI-ETH LP tokens.  When you’re ready to receive your LP rewards, all you need to do is exchange your SUSHI-ETH LP tokens back for your deposited crypto.  For every trade made while providing liquidity, users are charged a 0.3% fee, with 0.25% of the fee going toward the pool. After withdrawing, you’ll receive your portion of that 0.25%, relative to the total amount of SUSHI-ETH deposited.  Looking to expand your staking rewards? SushiSwap also lets you participate in yield farming as a part of its liquidity provider offering.  Stake SUSHI with SushiBar  SushiSwap has expanded its menu to offer a new range of DeFi products. One of these is SushiBar.  SushiBar lets SUSHI holders receive staking rewards on their SUSHI in the form of xSUSHI. These rewards come from swap fees and are currently being distributed at an APY (annual percentage yield) of around 11%. With xSUSHI, users can then gain access to SushiSwap’s governance system, maintaining voting rights and giving users immediate access to rewards while their SUSHI continues to grow.  To get started with staking on SushiBar, all you need to do is access the staking tab on SushiSwap, enter the total amount of SUSHI you’re looking to deposit and approve the transaction.  Lend and borrow crypto with Kashi  Finally, SushiSwap recently introduced crypto lending and borrowing through Kashi. For borrows, Kashi requires a certain amount of collateral to be deposited and charges APR (annual percentage rate) based on a variable rate. For lenders, Kashi offers a variable reward APR in exchange for assets deposited.  Although rewards from DeFi lending are sometimes referred to as staking rewards, remember that this is not the same as staking rewards from a validator. DeFi lending rewards come from the borrower on the other side of the transaction. Among other things, this is a fairly unregulated space, so it’s important to be aware of the associated risks.

42393805,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBLoH,1659561403,US Senate Bill Will Give CFTC Crypto Market Oversight – but Doesn't Say How Much,"The latest U.S. legislative effort to steer most crypto oversight to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has bipartisan support but does little to answer the crypto industry's top question: What makes a token a security or a commodity?  The legislation from the leaders of the Senate’s Agriculture Committee would require crypto firms involved in the trading of digital commodities – including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) – to register with the CFTC as their primary regulator, something industry leaders such as FTX co-founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried are cheering from the sidelines.  But while the bill would grant expanded authority to the CFTC to oversee crypto spot markets, it relies on the courts and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to set the boundaries for which tokens may be considered a commodity.  “Right now, there's really a patchwork of state regulations and no federal agency to conduct oversight over the cryptocurrencies, and we know that needs to change,” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the committee’s chairwoman, who unveiled the bill Wednesday with the panel’s ranking Republican, Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.). “The money of American consumers is at risk.”  Their committee has jurisdiction over commodities, so its oversight authority extends only to the CFTC. That’s as far as the lawmakers wanted to stretch their effort, unlike more sweeping bills such as the crypto push from Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)  “We're staying in our lane, but it's a really important lane for consumers,” Stabenow told reporters during a web call Wednesday. She explained the decision not to define crypto as securities was about staying inside the Senate panel’s jurisdiction. As for crypto commodities, the legislation defines them as a digital form of property that can be directly transferred between people without any institution acting as middleman.  The bill doesn’t go into great detail on that definition, however, apart from giving the examples of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), which the SEC previously defined as commodities. Apart from that, the legislation says the CFTC can affix its commodities stamp on whatever crypto assets aren't considered by the SEC to be securities.  However, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnman has also been vying for new authority to regulate digital commodity spot markets, where the assets directly change hands. The new bill would grant that authority. The CFTC would be given “exclusive jurisdiction over any account, agreement, contract or transaction involving a digital commodity trade,” according to the text of the bill.  Behnam commended the lawmakers for their “targeted” effort. He didn’t directly address the significant new CFTC role over cash markets, which would represent an unprecedented reach for the agency into a specific sector.  “We are at a critical inflection point where new legislative authority is needed to clarify ambiguities and provide a regulatory framework,” Behnam said in a statement.  The two senators, backed by colleagues Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and John Thune (R-S.D.), say they may pursue a September markup, which is an open session inviting debate over the details of the legislation.  They insisted this bill isn't just meant to start a discussion.While the Lummis-Gillibrand bill is meant to frame a debate that’s largely expected to take place next year, Stabenow and Boozman said they intend to get their bipartisan legislation passed this year.  Stabenow said it’s “very realistic” they could reach a committee markup in September, and she noted that only needing to get the bill through a single committee streamlines the process.  A similar bill has been previously introduced in the House of Representatives, but it hasn’t yet reached a committee vote.  If the bills become law, the CFTC would oversee the vast majority of the crypto market by value, because bitcoin and ether are the biggest tokens by far. Dealers, brokers, custodians and trading facilities would each have new registration requirements with the agency, and fees on those businesses would fund the staff growth the agency would need.  Boozman said the legislation assumes the commodities and securities agencies will work closely with each other, though he said “the CFTC is the place” where authority over the crypto industry belongs.  “We are going to need cooperation between the SEC and the CFTC as we move forward to really hash this out,” he said.  Denelle Dixon, Stellar Development Foundation’s CEO, had met last week with the senators to push for more regulatory clarity. She tweeted that this bill marks “a big step in that direction.”  Bankman-Fried took to Twitter on Wednesday to praise the legislation, saying it would “provide clear federal oversight to digital asset commodity markets” and that his firm would be happy to register under this proposed regime.  The most recent bills are part of a trend in Congress. There are bipartisan proposals for regulating U.S.-pegged stablecoins and legislation that would address some of the crypto industry’s chief tax worries. However, all face delays due to the coming congressional summer recess and the approaching midterm elections.  Lawmakers who once dismissed crypto as a momentary financial trend have changed their minds.  ""Everyone thought this was going to go away, that it was nothing,” Stabenow acknowledged. “Well, it's not nothing. We need to treat this seriously and take our responsibilities seriously.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/03/us-senate-bill-will-give-cftc-crypto-market-oversight-but-doesnt-say-how-much,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/082842bc21d8b6684afea06a3d5761f6cb06d759-3232x2424.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374115,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXi5f,1659561100,Ethereum Classic Is Not Ethereum so a Merge-Fueled Rally Won't Last: Messari,"Crypto miners have been showing increasing interest in Ethereum Classic because the Ethereum blockchain is in the process of moving from an energy-intensive proof-of-work system to proof-of-stake, which removes miner incentives. The process is known as the Merge.  Ethereum Classic, whose token is ETC, is an offshoot, or fork, of Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum, however, it is not changing systems, and that is what is making Ethereum Classic attractive to miners.  But hold on, said crypto data and analysis firm Messari’s senior research analyst Tom Dunleavy.  In a new report he said Ethereum Classic has little long-term viability. While the price of ETC may surge in the days leading up to the Merge, the token is unlikely to experience sustained growth.  Ethereum mining currently makes up 97% of graphics processing unit (GPU) mining revenue and has a daily revenue of $24 million, according to Messari.  After the Merge, users will be able to validate transactions by “staking” ETH rather than executing energy-intensive computations, rendering Ethereum-based mining tools nearly obsolete.  Miners will be forced to either sell their equipment or switch to mining ETC, which currently makes up 2% of GPU mining revenue and nets about $700,000 in daily revenue, according to Messari. This significant gap in profitability means that even if a “meaningful portion” of miners migrate to ETC, mining difficulty will increase drastically and render many miners unprofitable.  ETC rallied over 30% last week after the bitcoin (BTC) mining pool AntPool invested $10 million for development and exploration of Ethereum Classic mainnet applications.  However, Messari wrote that ETC has a history of price spikes when it shows up in crypto headlines, so its current surge is not representative of the network’s long-term growth.  According to Messari, Ethereum Classic has less than half the number of active addresses as Cardano. The network’s current level of development is less than one-tenth of Ethereum and Cardano and has not had a meaningful change in transaction volume since 2018.  “At the end of the day, prices should have some fundamental linkage to network usage and underlying economic activity,” Messari wrote. “Unfortunately for ETC holders, there isn’t much of either.”",NEGATIVE,ETC,ADA | BUSINESS | ETC | MINING | TRADING,Jimmy He,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/03/ethereum-classic-is-not-ethereum-so-a-merge-fueled-rally-wont-last,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c4cc86cdfc24f1973b0ff75982fa4660414c6fa-3453x2590.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But not for some of the biggest traders, who’ve retained a rosy view.  Cumberland, a Chicago-based market-making firm that buys and sells with institutions and other firms that do big transactions, recently surveyed its clients and found optimism abounds.  Though the median respondent didn’t see the pain as being fully over – reckoning that bitcoin will get as low as $16,000 in 2022 from around $23,500 currently – a large rebound is foreseen: a jump to a high of $32,000 sometime this year.  “Even in the wake of a severe sell-off, the average respondent was still high-conviction bullish,” according to the report released this week. “Even in a bear market, the direction is not surprising. After all, most of us are in crypto because we believe in bitcoin; if we didn’t have a bullish streak, we’d probably still be trading [foreign exchange].”  However, the magnitude of the anticipated rally is a surprise to Cumberland, a division of Chicago trading legend Don Wilson’s DRW, given that survey respondents only saw a 4% rally in the Nasdaq, and stocks and crypto prices have been tightly correlated.  Talk of a lengthy crypto winter has many investors fretting, so the bullishness among professionals with much at stake stands out. As with conventional markets such as stocks, though, crypto’s path does probably hinge on whatever the Federal Reserve does with U.S. interest rates. And, indeed, Cumberland’s clients took that view. “It’s very striking that the most common response for both positive and negative catalysts is movement by the Fed,” according to the report.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nick Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/03/amid-crypto-carnage-huge-traders-remain-super-bullish-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43fb07d126a71c279e583c0ec58d83ab80ec1550-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Volume last exceeded its 20-period moving average on July 29. The importance of trading volume is connected to evaluating the “strength” or conviction or both behind a price move. Higher volume often indicates more confidence in what direction an asset's price is headed.  BTC appears to have entered an uptrend after it hit lows on July 13. An extension of the trendline implies a move higher to $25,000, though that shouldn’t be interpreted as a price target in isolation. As mentioned above, BTC prices have moved above both their 10- and 50-period moving averages, while the moving averages themselves appear to be poised to “cross.”  Meanwhile, the Visible Range Volume Profile tool provides insight into where volume has clustered, specific to individual price points. This tool illustrates trading activity over a period of time and across specific price levels, while highlighting “points of control.”  The point of control, which is illustrated by the red line in the chart below, represents price levels where a substantial amount of price agreement exists. That in turn is often interpreted as showing levels of support or resistance. BTC is showing the largest amount of price agreement at about $21,000, with the next high volume node at $30,000.  BTC’s relative strength index (RSI) advanced slightly to 59, and is often used as a proxy for price momentum. There is also a visible uptrend in RSI since it hit a bottom in June.  On-chain activity indicates a decline in the put/call ratio  On-chain data indicates a decline in the put-call ratio for BTC below 0. The put-call ratio shows the volume of puts divided by the volume of calls traded in options contracts over the most recent 24 hours.  Because puts represent the option to sell bitcoin, and BTC calls represent the option to buy, a decline below zero implies that more calls than puts are being purchased. More calls being purchased is viewed as a bullish sign.  Fed officials' comments indicate more inflation  Despite what appears to be growing sentiment that the Federal Reserve may slow the pace of rate increases this year, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly stated Tuesday that inflation is “nowhere near” almost done, and that she was “puzzled” by bond market activity that implies that rates will be reduced.  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans offered similar thoughts, indicating that he would be on board for a large rate hike at the Fed's meeting in September.  Evans, however, appears to hold that view only if inflation wasn't improving. He also indicated that 50 basis points would be a “reasonable assessment.”  Altcoin roundup  Solana's SOL Token Holds Price Support Despite Hack: Early Wednesday, an unknown attacker drained at least $5 million of SOL and other tokens from Solana digital wallets.

In the second day of the exploit that has caused at least $6 million in various tokens to be stolen from users of the Slope and Slope-tied Phantom wallets, the Twitter account run by the Solana Foundation is blaming the software of the wallets and not its own code for the attack.  “This does not appear to be a bug with Solana core code, but in software used by several software wallets popular among users of the network,” the network said in a tweet on Wednesday morning.  The stolen funds were drained from unsuspecting hot wallets, which are wallets whose keys are stored online as opposed to on a hardware device.  In a statement, Slope developers said ""a cohort"" of wallets was compromised, but the developers didn't confirm whether the private key storage practices may have been involved. A Slope representative told CoinDesk, ""we are not storing any personal data on centralized server."" (The representative would later admit that this was an incorrect statement.)  Phantom wallet developers, for their part, said they have ""reason to believe the reported exploits are due to complications related to importing accounts to and from Slope.""  Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko initially tweeted that he suspected the hack could be linked to an Apple iOS supply chain issue, but has since narrowed the source to a Slope-related exploit.  A supply chain attack is when a bad actor inserts his or her own malicious code into the software of a larger system. An iOS supply chain attack, in this instance, would likely be an attacker accessing private keys by infiltrating internet-connected data.  Other developers on Twitter increasingly say they believe that Slope stored private keys as plain text on a centralized server, which was compromised by the attacker.  An on-chain sleuth would later reveal that Sentry, a third-party event logging platform connected to Slope, was doing just that.  Several users and organizations have taken to Twitter to collect information from victims of the exploit, though no sort of retribution plan has been laid out. The 9,000 drained wallets make up just a small fraction of the 25 million total Solana hot wallets in existence.

More so, CATE has spiked in price triggered by the increase in trading activity and hype coming from social media. Judging by the current technical analysis on the weekly price charts, CATE is soaring as it consistently edges through the third straight green candle.

The &apos;fear and greed index&apos; is an indicator that measures the general sentiment among investors in the crypto market. The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from zero to hundred for representing this sentiment. All values above 50 signify a greedy market, while those below the mark suggest fearful investors. Values approaching the end of the range of above 75 or below 25 indicate &apos;extreme greed&apos; and &apos;extreme fear&apos; sentiments, respectively. Historically, bottoms have tended to form during periods of extreme fear, while tops have occurred during the other extreme sentiment. Because of this, some investors believe the former periods bring ideal buying opportunities with them, while the latter ones can be suitable selling points.

42411428,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNeoe,1659550117,Banks Aren’t Going to 'HODL' Bitcoin,"“Bank for International Settlements to allow banks to keep 1% of reserves in bitcoin,” cries the headline on an article about the BIS’ newly proposed regulations for banks holding crypto assets.  The article was retweeted by Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, CEO of crypto exchange Binance, with the comment, “Banks now use bitcoin for reserves. Probably nothing.” Crypto Twitter went wild. Zhao's comment was retweeted thousands of times and “liked” by more than 10,000 people.  If the BIS really intends to “extend its hand” to bitcoin by allowing banks to hold it as reserves, as the article claims, that would indeed be great news for bitcoin as an asset class, though perhaps not for those hoping it would eliminate banks. But sadly, the BIS, which is an organization of the world's major central banks, has no intention of doing any such thing. The article unfortunately misunderstands the BIS’ proposals. Far from extending a helping hand to bitcoin, the BIS is cutting the rope.  Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.  The BIS proposes that banks’ total exposure to all cryptocurrencies (not just bitcoin) and most stablecoins should be no more than 1% of their Tier 1 capital. But Tier 1 capital is not reserves. And that is a restriction, not a permission.  Bank reserves  Bank reserves are a type of electronic cash issued by central banks and used by licensed banks to make payments. Solvent banks have more assets than they have deposits, but only a fraction of those assets are in the form of bank reserves. This is where the term “fractionally reserved” comes from. It doesn't mean the bank’s balance sheet doesn’t balance. It refers to the fact that the business of commercial banks is to earn profits by exchanging borrowed liquid assets (deposits) for higher-yielding illiquid assets (loans).  Because only a fraction of the bank’s assets can be used to settle deposit withdrawals, banks are always at risk of a bank run, which is when customers all demand their deposits back at the same time. In a typical bank run, the bank sells its illiquid assets at a heavy discount to obtain the reserves it needs to repay its customers. We call that a “fire sale.” Eventually, it runs out of assets to sell and is forced to shut its doors.  To limit the likelihood of bank runs and fire sales, regulators force licensed banks to hold a certain proportion of their balance sheets in the form of liquid assets. Traditionally, in the U.S., banks had to hold sufficient bank reserves to back at least 10% of eligible deposits – this was known as the “reserve requirement.” But the Federal Reserve abolished the reserve requirement in March 2020. It was replaced by the BIS’ ""liquidity coverage ratio"" (LCR), which forces banks to keep sufficient high-quality liquid assets to meet all known and anticipated payment requests over a 30-day period.  High-quality liquid assets  High-quality liquid assets include bank reserves and other assets that can be readily exchanged for bank reserves, such as U.S. Treasury bills. The assets don't include cryptocurrencies. Nothing in the BIS’ proposal changes that. Banks don't use bitcoin for reserves, and if the BIS’ proposal is adopted by regulators, they never will.  But if Tier 1 capital isn’t reserves, what is it? Well, it can be regarded as a cushion that protects depositors from losses if the bank fails.  When a bank fails, the total realizable value of its assets is typically less than the total value of its liabilities and equity. So not everyone is going to get their money back. Claims against the bank’s remaining assets are therefore settled in a strict order based on the ranking of the claim.  Read more: CBDCs, Not Crypto, Will Be Cornerstone of Future Monetary System, BIS Says  Secured claims (borrowing against which the bank has pledged collateral) and any “super-senior” claims are paid first. Depositors and senior bondholders, who are unsecured creditors of the bank, are next. Then, if there is anything left, holders of junior (“subordinated”) debt get paid. At the bottom of the pile are shareholders, who usually get nothing.  It should be obvious that if depositors are to get their money back, there must be enough shareholder equity and junior debt to absorb any losses. This is what is known as bank “capital.” Bank capital is divided into three categories: Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, which approximates to shareholders’ funds; Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital, which is typically debt convertible to equity; and Tier 2 capital, which is a broader category of subordinated debt. CET1 capital is first in line for losses if a bank files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, followed by AT1. Tier 2 is usually affected only if the bank goes into liquidation.  The capital ratios reported by banks are the ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and total capital to total assets weighted for risk. The “leverage ratio” introduced after the 2008 financial crisis is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to unweighted total assets. Here, for example, is how J.P. Morgan & Chase reported its capital and leverage ratios in the first quarter:  (The ”supplementary leverage ratio” (SLR) is a U.S. specific version of the BIS Tier 1 leverage ratio.)  Capital requirements  The basic BIS capital requirements specify that banks must have a minimum total capital of 8% of risk-weighted assets, of which 6% must be Tier 1. National regulators, however, usually have more stringent requirements, particularly for the biggest banks – the ones that are “too big to fail."" After all, no one wants the government to have to bail out big banks again like it did in 2008. So in the example above, J.P Morgan has much higher Tier 1 and total capital ratios than the BIS minimum.  Now that we have clarified the difference between Tier 1 capital and reserves, let’s look at that BIS proposal for crypto assets again. The BIS provides a handy chart showing how it has divided crypto assets into two groups, each with two subgroups, and assigned different capital requirements to each group:  Group 1 is tokenized traditional assets and stablecoins that meet narrow criteria for stability and redeemability. Group 2 is everything else. Group 2 is deemed to be riskier than Group 1 and is therefore subject to much more stringent regulations.  All cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are in Group 2. So are most stablecoins.  Bitcoin limits  The 1% exposure limit applies only to Group 2 assets. It means that because Group 2 assets are extremely risky, banks won't be allowed to have much in the way of exposure to them. In the example above, J.P. Morgan has Tier 1 capital of 13.7% of total risk-weighted assets. So for J.P. Morgan, total Group 2 crypto asset holdings (including bitcoin) can’t be more than 0.137% of its total risk-weighted assets – and considerably less of its total assets unweighted for risk. Admittedly, for a bank the size of J.P. Morgan, that is still a lot of bitcoin. But it’s worth remembering that the previous version of the BIS proposals, issued in June 2021, didn’t impose a total exposure limit. So, far from encouraging banks to hold bitcoin, the revised proposals actually make it more difficult.  In fact the BIS’ proposals make it extremely expensive for banks to hold or trade bitcoin on their own account at all. The regulations for Group 2a and 2b assets in the chart above force banks to write off bitcoin holdings fully against capital. The BIS’ 2021 proposals explain that the 1,250% risk weighting for Group 2b assets is effectively a 100% capital charge: “A $100 exposure would give rise to risk weighted assets of $1,250, which when multiplied by the minimum capital requirement of 8% results in a minimum capital requirement of $100 (i.e. the same value of the original exposure, as 12.5 is reciprocal of 0.08).”  Read more: 9 Out of 10 Central Banks Exploring Digital Currency, BIS Says  For Group 2a assets, positions can be netted and the effect of hedging taken into account before the capital charge is applied. But for Group 2b, any hedging must be ignored and the capital charge applied to the larger of total gross long and short positions.  In layman’s terms, this means that banks cannot use customer deposits or issue senior bonds to finance the acquisition of bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. They can finance them only from capital. That ensures that in the event of the value of their crypto holdings crashing to zero, none of their customers or creditors will be affected. But equity finance is considerably more expensive than debt finance – and shareholders might look askance at a bank taking such risks with their funds.  These regulations, if adopted, will apply only to banks holding and trading cryptocurrencies and private stablecoins on their own account. They won’t prevent banks providing crypto custody and trading services for their customers. And they won’t prevent banks from issuing their own tokenized assets and stablecoins. In fact, because these could meet the criteria for Group 1 assets, the proposals arguably encourage the banks to do so.  A place for CBDCs  And the elephant in the room are crypto assets issued by central banks called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which are completely excluded from this framework. BIS’ proposals don’t allow banks to use bitcoin as part of reserves. But CBDCs could potentially extend or replace reserves. And because they would be issued by the central bank, the BIS’ draconian capital requirements wouldn't apply to them. So not only do these proposals make holding bitcoin decidedly unattractive for banks, they set the stage for the entry of CBDCs to the crypto world.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | BNB,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/03/banks-arent-going-to-hodl-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c32af794de92fffa83868e5ea8b0e01213628284-5332x3999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411409,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNdr8,1659549170,Lessons From the Turkish Government's Hasty Attempt to Regulate Cryptocurrencies,"The Turkish government's ambitious plan to restrict the use of cryptocurrencies to protect the local currency, the Turkish lira, faced a strong challenge from the crypto communities in the country. It’s a rare example of grassroots action effectively pressuring the government, and may provide a valuable lesson for lawmakers and organizers in other countries.  Despite President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressing urgency in December about regulating cryptocurrencies, a bill has not been introduced yet. In late December a draft version of a crypto bill supposedly backed by the ruling party in the country, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), was leaked and circulated on social media.  Burak Tamac is a senior researcher at CryptoQuant, and Erkan Oz is an economist and journalist.  This proposed legislation sought to restrict international exchanges from operating in Turkey and ban the use of self-custody wallets – in the name of protecting the local currency against capital outflow. AKP never officially accepted that the leaked bill was drafted by the government, but many believed the bill was indeed written by a team close to the president and leaked on purpose to judge reactions.  The bill, which suggested significant restrictions on investing and using cryptocurrencies, should be opposed. Crypto adoption has accelerated in Turkey over the past two year, in part due to high inflation. My co-author and I believe that restricting crypto is a restriction on freedom, and is not only ethically and constitutionally wrong but also would worsen the country’s capital outflow problem rather than solving it.  See also: Turkey President Erdogan to Send Crypto Law to Parliament  One of the principle concerns over the bill was that it would give an unfair advantage to local exchanges over international ones, likely negatively affecting Turkish users. Many think the ruling party executives are being influenced by domestic exchanges to ban more efficient and cheaper global options, though the government has denied such accusations.  Such a ban would benefit both the government (which is trying to curb short-term dollar outflows) and Turkish crypto exchanges (that are trying to maintain their market share against foreign high-volume exchanges), but likely harm users.  Engaging with crypto users  The outrage on social media forced government actors to engage with various Turkish crypto communities to assuage their concerns about restrictions.  A meeting on the draft crypto bill was held at the Parliament on Dec. 29 by Mustafa Elitas (the former deputy economy minister from AKP). The government was also represented by Mahir Unal (the former deputy tourism minister from AKP), Omer Ileri (AKP’s deputy president) and senior bureaucrats from various government agencies including the Central Bank and Treasury.  Crypto, too, had a showing.  What happened in the meeting?  Members of various crypto communities expressed their concerns about the leaked crypto bill. My co-author, the economist Erkan Oz, detailed the prevailing concerns of crypto communities on social media as follows:  There are at least 5 million crypto-asset investors in Turkey, according to the report published by local crypto exchange Paribu. Therefore, the opinions of these investors and entrepreneurs should be considered during the law-making process.  Crypto investors do not drive foreign exchange outflow from the country, as it is generally assumed and the paramount concern of the government to protect the local currency. On the contrary, because the purchased crypto assets appreciate significantly over time, investors create foreign exchange inflows for the country.  Measures such as licensing, technological compliancy and capital-backing requirements should be introduced to protect retail investors.  The bill must not strictly prohibit investors from accessing exchanges and the use of self-custody wallets. Otherwise, Turkey's crypto industry would turn into a closed ecosystem. Furthermore, such a ban against exchanges and wallets would engender price premium/discount between the international markets and Turkey. This would also pave the way for establishment of black markets.  If the draft circulating on social media is enacted in its current format, Turkey will lose the opportunity to educate software developers and entrepreneurs in the blockchain domain.  The ruling party’s officials and bureaucrats attending the meeting did not express their views on either the draft legislation or the proposals expressed by the crypto communities at that time. However, the government postponed the bill for apparently political reasons.  Turkey's general elections will be held in June 2023, if not earlier as speculated in November 2022. AKP executives most likely advised the government officials to engage with crypto communities because they are relatively young voters keen on their freedoms.  Therefore, jeopardizing millions of voters due to a bill would not be a politically correct action before the election campaigns begin. In addition, according to many polls, the upcoming election would be one of the most vital elections for AKP to remain in power since 2002.  See also: Turkey Makes the Case for Bitcoin as Erdogan Runs the Autocrat's Inflation Playbook | The Node  Even in Turkey, where the democratic process does not function as intended, a strong government that controls all branches of the state decided not to pass a top-down bill to regulate cryptocurrencies due to community objections.  The dynamic power of grassroots organizations prevented even an authoritarian-leaning government from passing a bill restricting the freedoms derived from using cryptocurrencies. From this perspective, we can assume regulations would be legislated more slowly than anticipated in the United States and the European Union because of the robust deliberation processes protected by the democratic structure.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Burak Tamac, Erkan Öz",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/03/lessons-from-the-turkish-governments-hasty-attempt-to-regulate-cryptocurrencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d7c87d7a4f94d068d98ffa661197e02399dcd3a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374118,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXiAh,1659548559,US Lawmakers Move to Clarify Definition of 'Brokers' in 2021 Infrastructure Law,"A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers wants to ensure that the definition of a crypto ""broker"" for tax reporting purposes is not too broad.  Supported by Senators Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the bill would exclude miners or other node operators and wallet manufacturers from the definition of a ""broker"" in a 2021 infrastructure law that imposed new tax reporting requirements on those facilitating crypto transactions.  According to a press release, the bill is identical to a proposed amendment that the group submitted last year, when the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was being considered by the Senate.  The law proposed enforcing stricter tax reporting requirements on brokers facilitating crypto transactions. However, lawmakers and crypto industry advocates alike warned that the language might be overly broad, and could inadvertently enforce these same requirements on individuals, miners and wallet manufacturers who would not be able to record or report the kind of information that brokers could.  ""Nothing in this section or the amendments made by this section shall be construed to create any inference that a person described ... includes any person solely engaged in the business of (A) validating distributed ledger transactions, without providing other functions or services, or (B) selling hardware or software for which the sole function is to permit persons to control private keys which are used for accessing digital assets on a distributed ledger,"" the text of the new bill said.  The U.S. Senate did not vote on the then Wyden-Toomey-Lummis amendment. The lawmakers instead sought unanimous consent to approve the amendment, as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) had closed the ordinary process to hasten the overall bill's passage. However, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) blocked unanimous consent over an unrelated military spending amendment.  The Treasury Department has signaled that miners may already be excluded from the tax reporting requirements. In a letter sent to multiple lawmakers, the department said the reporting requirements would only apply to parties that already have access to the transaction information that would need to be reported.

The software company's president, Phong Le, will become CEO.  The management changes will allow for the company's enterprise business to have the full focus of the CEO, with Saylor devoting his energies to strategies for corporate bitcoin (BTC) adoption.  “In my next job, I intend to focus more on bitcoin,” Saylor tweeted early Wednesday in a tongue-and-cheek response to those who think the moves might mean he has become less bullish on the crypto.  Meanwhile, Le said investors shouldn’t expect any surprises in strategy. On the company’s earnings call late Tuesday, Le said he has been aligned with Saylor on the enterprise and bitcoin strategy throughout their time together. The changes, he said, will free up time for him to run the company. ""I would sort of see this as a business-as-usual transition,"" Le told analysts.  “We think this transition was underway for quite some time with Mr. Le's appointment as president two years ago,” Joe Vafi, an equity research analyst with Canaccord Genuity, told clients in a note Wednesday. “Overall, we don't expect any material change in the strategic direction of the company.”  Vafi rates MicroStrategy a buy, although he did trim his price target to $372 from $453 (current stock price is $317). MicroStrategy stock, said Vafi, is the “most streamlined play” for equity investors to gain bitcoin exposure in the public markets.  Of last quarter's $917.8 million impairment charge on bitcoin holdings during the second quarter, it's ""essentially meaningless,"" said BTIG analyst Mark Palmer, noting it has no impact on the company’s inherent value. ""That value can be easily ascertained as it stems from just two sources,"" said Palmer, ""the market value of MSTR’s bitcoin holdings and the value of its enterprise analytics software unit.” Palmer reiterated his buy rating and $950 price target.  Still, the impairment could have had some impact on Saylor's role change, according to some crypto industry participants. ""There was no doubt that there was going to be external pressure from stakeholders to see some sort of response from the company,"" said Tanim Rasul, chief operating officer of crypto trading platform NDAX.  Rasul said Saylor was a key proponent in advocating for corporate bitcoin adoption, although impairment losses may have spooked other publicly traded companies, especially considering the uncertainties across the global economy and markets.  ""Michael Saylor’s response was to push himself into an executive chairman role so that a new CEO could focus more on core operations for MicroStrategy,"" Rasul said, contrasting Elon Musk and his company, Tesla (TSLA), which opted to sell a good chunk of its bitcoin holdings.

The price of Bitcoin (BTC) saw a retracement as it could not break and hold above important support that corresponds with the daily 50 exponential moving average (EMA). BTC&apos;s unable to hold that region has led to AVAX struggles to form good support. Avax Weekly Chart Analysis The weekly chart for Avax shows a downtrend reversal to a low of $16.3, where buyers were more willing to step into the market. The chart shows the price of Avax needs to break and close above $23.7 for it to resume its bullish movement to the $40 mark price anticipated by investors. Avax has formed strong support at the $16.3 mark area, with more buyers willing to place bids in this region. This region can be seen as a good demand zone should the price of Avax retraces back to the current price.

42411412,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNdxk,1659545849,Who Will Mine Ethereum After It's Gone?,"Ethereum’s long-awaited transition from a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake-based consensus system is just over the horizon, and the anticipation has created a bullish narrative for the smart-contract platform. That’s bittersweet for one very significant group: After the merge, current Ethereum miners will be left with immense amounts of computer hardware that will be much, much less useful.  But some miners are not going gently into that good night. On July 27, a longtime Ethereum investor and miner named Chandler Guo tweeted “ETH PoW coming soon”: a declaration, in brief, that Guo would lead his fellow miners to continue supporting the current proof-of-work based Ethereum chain after the system change known as the Merge.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  There are some rational arguments for a continued ETH PoW chain, and it would certainly be a fascinating experiment if it goes forward. But there are a lot more reasons to think the chain wouldn’t be viable in the long term – and a lot of ways that an ETH PoW continuation could be leveraged by disingenuous bad actors.  Double spending an entire blockchain  To understand both the potential and the risk of a post-merge “ETH PoW” chain, consider how the upcoming Merge will work, and what will be left behind. Very broadly, the historic state of the Ethereum chain at the time of the Merge, most crucial address balances, will be transferred to the new proof-of-stake consensus environment.  But the same state history will also still exist on the proof-of-work miners chugging away right up until the microsecond before the Merge. Those miners could fairly easily continue accepting transactions and adding blocks to their copy of the Ethereum chain using proof-of-work. It also means that they will still be rewarded by the pre-Merge PoW algorithm with tokens that look a lot like ETH, but exist only on the degraded proof-of-work chain.  Similarly, all ETH holders just before the Merge will have keys for tokens on both chains. Using them will likely involve some complexity – technical work or special tools – but many default applications like MetaMask will presumably remove integrations with the old chain to prevent user confusion. Also important: Only holders who self-custody are likely to retain control of their ETH PoW tokens. It’s likely that many custodial exchanges will not give users access to their tokens on the continued proof-of-work chain.  See also: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: What Is the Difference?  However, a major (if often unspoken) goal of Chandler Guo and his ETH PoW initiative would be to generate enough interest in ETH PoW that exchanges do list it and make it tradable as a token separate from ETH proper. While ETH PoW would likely be tradeable via decentralized exchanges sooner, mainstream centralized exchange listings would be key to maintaining broad market interest.  At the crudest level, this is where the money is for ETH PoW advocates. If they get enough exchange listings, it will effectively guarantee that there is at least some market value for both the tokens they already own and, perhaps more important, new ETH PoW tokens they mine post-Merge.  Just in case something goes very, very wrong  Of course, that’s got nothing to do with the actual usefulness of ETH PoW. Is there any reason for a proof-of-work version of Ethereum to continue to exist, other than to find a price for something that has lost most of its value overnight? What are the chances there will be actual user demand for ETH PoW that would lead to longer-term stable value or appreciation?  There are some non-financial arguments for continuing the proof-of-work chain as “ETH PoW” (or whatever they ultimately decide to call it, because “ETH PoW” frankly stinks). Above all, rational or not, there will be some uncertainty about the stability of the new Ethereum chain after the Merge. If something goes truly catastrophically bad with the Merge, there is some chance users, apps and even assets (see below) will migrate back to the PoW chain. In this scenario, positions on the “old” chain could act as something akin to insurance.  To be very clear, that chance is vanishingly small. There have been several Ethereum test merges at this point, and they’ve gone well. But the chance isn’t zero.  See also: Goerli Is Coming: Ethereum’s Last Rehearsal Before the Merge  Longer-term, there remain some uncertainties about proof-of-stake as a sustainable security system for Ethereum. Most pointedly, there are ongoing concerns that over time, proof-of-stake leads to centralization by rewarding those who are already big holders. Governance manipulation is another perceived risk of proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. The longer-term emergence of these or other flaws could lead players to migrate back to a proof-of-work version of Ethereum, which would raise the value of positions there.  Empty circles and severed tethers  There are, however, bigger and more obvious reasons that the ETH PoW chain will have little substantive value. In fact, it will likely be such a confusing and broken landscape that it could even be described as having negative value.  Above all, most of the assets and systems that people actually use on Ethereum would be effectively dead on the forked proof-of-work chain. Stablecoins denoted on the degraded chain won’t be honored by entities like Circle, for instance. That in itself would be enough to render DeFi systems on ETH PoW effectively unusable. (DeFi stands for decentralized finance, a grouping of apps that provide financial services without middlemen.)  But there’s an even bigger problem, especially for the period right after the Merge: The decentralized price oracles that make DeFi platforms functional, in particular for trading programmable assets, would be broken.  A second set of issues also confront the ETH PoW concept. In order to incentivize the proof-of-stake transition, Ethereum’s creators built in a time bomb. This so-called difficulty bomb is scheduled to effectively make the chain impossibly difficult to mine after the Merge, slowing transactions to a crawl.  To pull off its plan, the ETH PoW group would have to unify around yet another fork, this one to remove the difficulty bomb. This could prove truly challenging in the absence of the Ethereum Foundation and other leaders who often point the way on big Ethereum changes.  The ETH PoW group could also, in theory, work with stablecoin issuers and oracle maintainers to bring working versions of those products back to the ETH PoW chain. This would all require significant financial and coding resources, though. The ETH PoW advocates might well have the money to throw around, but talent is tougher: There is already a serious lack of skilled Ethereum developers, so recruiting devs to work on a decommissioned leftover might not be easy.  There’s a final reason to question whether ETH PoW would have real value: There already IS an alternate proof-of-work-based version of Ethereum. It’s called Ethereum Classic (ETC), and it emerged from the 2016 rollback of the Ethereum chain after the infamous DAO Attack.  In fact, ETC has experienced a major rally recently and has also seen rallies in the leadup to previous Ethereum upgrades, supporting the idea that there is some perceived value in a “backup” version of Ethereum.  But despite that, Ethereum Classic has gained limited traction among users since it split from Ethereum. Even after ETC’s recent rally, it only trades at about 10% of ETH’s value. Given that, it’s unclear why there would be any need for two proof-of-work versions of Ethereum.  Strangest of all, one prominent supporter of ETH Classic, at least rhetorically, was Kevin Guo – the man now spearheading the ETH PoW plan. At the time, he had great hopes, declaring that “Ethereum Classic will replace Ethereum Core.”  Maybe the second time’s the charm.  The world’s craziest trade  Given all the headwinds, I don’t believe an ETH PoW fork is likely to become a thriving or even truly viable ecosystem. But if it goes forward in even the most limited form, it will trigger a wave of truly bonkers speculative trading as people try to profit from the “free” tokens left behind by the fork.  One simple and helpful frame for traders considering their positions is the question of value distribution between the two chains. Kevin Zhou at Galois Capital, for instance, has predicted that while 96% of Ethereum’s value will stay with the new PoS chain, 4% might accrue to the new ETH PoW chain.  Beyond that, trying to make money from a hypothetical ETH PoW trade would truly be a game for only the most technically skilled players. As a recent, excellent BitMEX research piece explains, the transition would likely break nearly all the trading infrastructure that average traders are used to.  BitMEX suggests that extreme measures, up to the major undertaking of running your own entire Ethereum node, will be necessary to make an ETH PoW play. For anyone not instantly intimidated by that idea, BitMEX also lays out some interesting tactical options.  See also: Sell the Ethereum Merge | Opinion  Personally, as a decidedly non-expert trader, my plan for a hypothetical ETH PoW fork is extremely simple and beautifully lazy. First, I’ll be moving all my ether off exchanges and into local wallets to guarantee I hold the keys on both chains. Then I’ll hang on to my ETH PoW until a centralized exchange lists it.  Then I’ll dump most of it and buy myself a sandwich or a gold watch, and be happy with whichever it is.  Welcome to ETHPVP  As always, a big event also represents a big opportunity for scammers, and there are equally serious risks for novices on that front. Be aware that there should be very little reason for any ETH PoW advocate or group to ask for money for pretty much anything. After all, if it was a good idea, shouldn’t the PoW fork come with a sustainable community and organic demand to support further development?  The BitMEX report also contains what I think is the most honest assessment of the ETH PoW trade you’ll read anywhere:  “Ethereum maxis should actually (somewhat perversely) want the ETH PoW chain to survive, at least for a bit, so that they can dump ETH PoW coins into the market and get more ETH (or US$). That way they can make money from what they consider to be ‘stupid’ ETH PoW supporters, before ETH PoW dies a slow death over the next few years. Therefore, many people may try to sell their ETH PoW as fast as they can and the price may be weak.”  This may not be what’s truly in ETH PoW advocates’ hearts – I don’t know. But it will certainly be the attitude of many traders who join in.",NEUTRAL,ETC,BUSINESS | ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42374114,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXi39,1659540614,Want to Strike Terror in Crypto Markets in 2022? Just Say You’re Suspending Withdrawals,"Bank runs are nothing new. Those frightening incidents when too many customers demand their money back at the same time have destroyed many financial institutions over the years.  Traditional banks largely solved that with deposit insurance, a guarantee from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to make customers whole up to a certain amount if their bank fails.  With no such protection in crypto, the phrase “suspending withdrawals” has become a source of fear in 2022, a sign of deep trouble at firms that have tried to create a modern version of banking through digital assets. Customers who trusted the lender or exchange with their cryptocurrencies are suddenly unable to get the assets back.  One example is crypto broker Voyager Digital. Its Canadian-listed stock plunged 42% on July 4 after it said it was “temporarily suspending trading, deposits, withdrawals and loyalty rewards.” The situation got worse days later when the company filed for bankruptcy.  Voyager's troubles came as crypto prices remained hugely depressed from their peaks. And it illustrates that when a crypto firm pauses withdrawals – warning the world of serious liquidity issues – it will have trouble restarting them outside of bankruptcy court.  “The problem is, once the withdrawal suspensions happen, it’s too late for the investors,” said Paul McCaffery, co-head of equities for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  When crypto lenders go broke  Following the collapse of the stablecoin terraUSD (UST) and the implosion of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, known as 3AC, a swath of liquidity-strapped crypto lenders found that they could no longer meet customer demands.  Throughout June and early July, lenders including Celsius Network, Babel Finance, CoinFLEX, Voyager, Vauld and Zipmex halted withdrawals and transfers. Others such as CoinLoan and Finblox allowed withdrawals to continue, but at a reduced limit.  When crypto lenders go broke, the traditional financial regulatory system can’t help. The FDIC, which backstops deposits at conventional banks in the U.S., released a fact sheet on July 29 reminding the public of that.  Some lenders, such as Zipmex, have been able to recover and start releasing select tokens back to users’ wallets. The majority of lenders, however, have kept withdrawals paused, with Celsius joining Voyager in bankruptcy.  No one can predict how far the domino effect of solvency issues will run, but it’s a safe bet crypto players will shudder if any other firms warn they are suspending withdrawals.  “The announcements are decelerating but not likely quite done yet as the fallout from the 3AC solvency continues to play out,” McCaffery wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “I am hopeful that all of this bloodshed will result in better risk management processes embedded in the business models going forward.”  Timeline of suspended withdrawals  June 12:Celsius says that it is “pausing all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts.” (Celsius filed for bankruptcy on July 13.)  June 17:Babel says that “redemptions and withdrawals from Babel Finance products will be temporarily suspended.”  June 23:CoinFLEX announces that it is “pausing all withdrawals.”  July 1:Voyager Digital says that it is “temporarily suspending trading, deposits, withdrawals and loyalty rewards.” (Voyager filed for bankruptcy on July 5.)  July 4:Vauld says that it “made the difficult decision to suspend all withdrawals, trading and deposits.”  July 20:Zipmex says that it is “pausing withdrawals until further notice.”  August 2: ZB.com announces that ""deposit and withdrawal services are now suspended"" after losing nearly five million in a suspected hack.

The slow yet steady gains of CATE shows how low market cap coins can advance and give you remarkable rewards. CATE Pumps Up Price by 16.63% According to CoinMarketCap, CATE meme coin is rising steadily as it pumps the price by 16.63% or 0.000001057. More so, CATE has spiked in price triggered by the increase in trading activity and hype coming from social media. Judging by the current technical analysis on the weekly price charts, CATE is soaring as it consistently edges through the third straight green candle. CATE has recently been able to outrank the $0.000000714 and $0.000000779 resistance zones which have been turned into a support zone. Accordingly, CATE was able to breach the $0.00000103 resistance level for a bit there but has now retraced. No doubt, CateCoin is extremely bullish especially as it racked up in terms of volume. CATE is also shaping up into a classic bull flag pattern with the potential of breaking out seen on the upside. If CATE can keep this price momentum going, then it can revisit $0.000001. Another scenario is if CATE switches into bearish mode and lose its bull flag precipitating a bearish reversal momentum. CATE coin is performing way better than other crypto as it was able to bounce from the support zone as shown with its correction on the 0.236 Fibonacci level. If CATE can maintain its traction, its price can shoot up to over $0.0000013 at the end of this year. However, all of these will depend on Bitcoin’s performance because the king of crypto influences how the other meme coins perform and behave in the market. CATE Offers More Value Than Other Meme Coins According to CoinMarketCap, CATE has a very low market capital of $29 million. With that being said, increased and consistent traction will lead to a pump in value to as much as 10x to 20x for CateCoin. In a space dominated by dog meme coins, CATE is the first-of-its-kind meme coin that enables meme creators to create and earn from NFTs. Right now, CateCoin is depicted as one of the most powerful meme coins in the market. CATE has so much to offer that encompasses the value of other meme coins. cate offers NFTs, gaming, mobile wallet, and Dapps.

The cryptocurrency saw significant losses over the past months, but it has been able to recover faster than other altcoins. At the time of writing, BNB&apos;s price trades at $290 with a 4% and 17% profit over the past 24 hours and 7 days, respectively. Thus, making this cryptocurrency one of the best-performing assets in the crypto top 10 by market cap only surpasses Polkadot&apos;s (DOT) 22% profit in one week.

Retail investors and mid-size investors have been jumping into BNB&apos;s price action as the cryptocurrency attempts to flip $300 into support. Additional data shows that ask liquidity for the BNB/USDT trading pairs has been reducing between $300 and $320 recording a high amount of sell orders. There are over $2 million in asks orders around those levels, and there is a lot of potential for price volatility. This is because the order book records liquidity gaps between higher levels. This could translate into bullish momentum if the price of BNB is able to break above those critical resistance levels.

The miner gained $9.5 million in power credits and other benefits from the curtailment.  “As energy demand in ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) reached all-time highs this past month, the company voluntarily curtailed its energy consumption in order to ensure that more power would be available in Texas,” CEO Jason Les said in a statement.  Several bitcoin miners temporarily halted mining operations as energy demand soared in July due to heat waves that swept through the U.S., particularly in Texas. Riot curtailed 11,717 megawatt hours in July, enough to power 13,121 average homes for a month, Les said, adding that it lowered power costs for the company.  Riot said it also relocated miners that were hosted with Coinmint to Riot’s Whinstone Facility in Rockdale, Texas, which resulted in about 2,146 miners being offline.  Keeping up with its strategy to monetize some of the bitcoins it mines, Riot sold 275 bitcoins in July, generating $5.6 million. The miner now holds about 6,696 bitcoins.  Riot said its current hashrate, or mining power capacity, is 4.2 exahash per second (EH/s), and it expects total self-mining hashrate to climb to 12.5 EH/s by the first quarter of 2023. In comparison, Riot’s competitor, Marathon Digital, said it will reach a hashrate capacity of 23.3 EH/s in 2023.  Riot's shares have fallen about 65% this year, underperforming bitcoin’s slump of about 50%. The stock was up 7% on Wednesday morning Eastern time.

The legislation aims to narrow the path as to who will oversee the emerging crypto space, as it&apos;s not currently under a singular regulatory regime.

Chart of The Day: Solana's SOL put-call volume ratio spikes.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  The crypto market was mostly trading in the green on Wednesday despite news that popular layer 1 blockchain Solana was exploited Tuesday night.  An unknown attacker drained at least $5 million worth of SOL, SPL and other Solana-based tokens from unsuspecting users.  Bitcoin (BTC) was up 2% on the day, reclaiming $23,000. The price of BTC has moved above the highly watched 200-week moving average of $22,900, a positive sign for bulls.  Ether (ETH) was up 4.7% over the last 24 hours at $1,660. Uniswap’s UNI was up 15%, Curve (CRV) gained 10%, and Aave rose 8%.  Although the prices of bitcoin and ether haven't been affected by the news of the hack, Solana’s SOL token slipped 2%.  “The hack will definitely cast a shadow over Solana’s credibility as a better alternative to Ethereum, especially when it comes to security,” Mikkel Morch, executive director of ARK36, a digital asset fund, wrote in an email. “It may even give Ethereum some additional boost from the narrative perspective as the safest and most reliable DeFi (decentralized finance) ecosystem.”  Earlier in the week, the cryptocurrency bridge Nomad suffered a $200 million exploit. Since that breach, blockchain security company PeckShield said $9 million has been returned, equating to around 4.75% of the total loss.  In other news, Ethereum developers addressed a potential glitch ahead of the Merge in the 92nd Consensus Layer Call. One researcher said that the chance of such a glitch (an MEV-boost failure) is slim, but contingencies should ensure that the Merge still goes smoothly.

But with the Ethereum Merge still at least a month away, some analysts are already sharpening their pencils on various strategies to profit from any revolt in the ranks.  According to Decrypt, Chinese crypto miner Chandler Guo has started a campaign to fork the Ethereum blockchain and create a spinoff, hewing to the proof-of-work (PoW) system that Ethereum uses now.  The story was based on a Chinese-language tweet from Guo: “Ethpow will be coming soon,” the post reads. “I fork ethereum once, I will fork it again!”  The cryptocurrency wouldn't be ETH post-Merge. With the fork, or code change, Guo would create a new cryptocurrency called ETHPOW, according to Decrypt.  Investment research analysts at BitMEX published a blog post arguing that a new chain might generate some interest from investors and traders.  ""Although there are many technical challenges that ETHPoW faces, as long as the chain survives, it looks likely that there could be positive narratives around the coin and leading centralized exchanges are likely to list it,"" the analysts wrote.  As outlined by BitMEX:  “Doing the above trade, you have potentially got more USD for free with almost zero risk! Well, zero risk when only considering certain types of risk, such as price movements,” the BitMEX post states.  “ETHPoW may generate a lot of excitement, and we predict that ETH vs ETHPoW will be a popular trading pair post-split, at least until another interesting dynamic comes along,"" BitMEX analysts said.  But others are dismissing the effort almost entirely.  According to Will Harborne, founder of Rhino.fi, there is likely little profit to be made from trading ETHPoW.  Read the full story here.  Chart of the Day: SOL Put-Call Volume Ratio Spikes  By Omkar Godbole  Solana's put-call volume ratio, a gauge measuring the number of put options traded relative to calls, surged above 3 early Wednesday, pointing to bearish market sentiment.  The surge implies that more than three put options were traded for every call option.  Perhaps investors sought protection against a price drop following reports of a multimillion-dollar hack from Solana's digital wallets Phantom and Slope.  A put option offers insurance against price drops while a call option offers protection against price rallies.  Sol's Deribit-based options market is quite small relative to ether and bitcoin. As of this writing, the notional open interest in the SOL options market was $19.2 million – a meager 0.42% of bitcoin's $4.5 billion.

42411107,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC93J,1659532706,Chileans Take Refuge in Stablecoins Amid Economic Turmoil,"Accustomed to living in the most stable economy in Latin America, residents of Chile are turning to stablecoins to protect their assets from recent record inflation and the increasing devaluation of the peso. Local crypto exchanges have seen a 50% increase in stablecoin transactions in the last three months.  CryptoMarket, a Chile-based exchange with 200,000 users in the country, registered a 50% increase in purchases of the two most commonly used stablecoins, tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC), during the second quarter of 2022, CryptoMarket Chile country manager Eduardo Pérez de Castro told CoinDesk.  Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price. USDT and USDC are pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar.  “Today, stablecoins represent 30% of users’ total purchases, and what they mostly choose to buy if it is their first time using the platform,” Pérez de Castro added.  Buda.com, which in 2015 was one of the first crypto exchanges to launch in Chile, has also seen increasing interest in stablecoins. Stablecoin market share on the platform rose from 11% in June up to 20% in July. USDC, which has been on the platform for less than a year, is the third-most-traded currency after bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  Read more: Chilean Digital Peso Would Need to Work Offline, Central Bank Governor Says  “We see this as a huge trend and something users are taking as an opportunity to buy U.S. dollars easily without having to go to a bank or exchange house,” said Jazmín Jorquera, chief operating officer at Buda, which has more than 500,000 users and operations in Chile, Argentina, Peru and Colombia.  Stablecoin's increasing use is tied to Chile’s faltering macroeconomic situation. In June, the country’s year-to-year inflation rose to 12.5%, the highest record in 28 years. One month later, its peso currency hit a record low of 1,045 per U.S. dollar, dropping 3.7% in one day and forcing the central bank to make a $25 billion intervention in the foreign exchange market to stop a higher devaluation.  “The common Chilean citizen is turning to stablecoins to save money and conserve value,” said Joel Vainstein, co-founder of OrionX, a Chile-based exchange with more than 100,000 users and operations in Peru and, soon, in Mexico. USDT became the platform’s second-most-traded currency during the last three months.  The reasons  According to Pérez de Castro, the recent instability of the Chilean exchange rate is mainly due to political uncertainty. Citizens will vote in September on a pivotal change of the Chilean Constitution, which hasn’t been modified since 1980, when dictator Augusto Pinochet was in power.  The vote is tied to what Chileans call the “social outburst,” a series of protests that took place in October 2019 after an increase in public transport rates. The riots, which resulted in military violence, resulted in burned buses and several deaths, lasted until March 2020 and led to the victory of left-wing leader Gabriel Boric over the incumbent right-wing government in the presidential election of December 2021.  In context of this instability, local banks saw a 200% increase in demand for U.S.-dollar bank accounts between April 2021 and April 2022. But obtaining a foreign currency account is not an easy thing to do in Chile.  According to Pablo Donders, a Chilean economist specializing in cryptocurrencies, to open a bank account in U.S. dollars, locals must first open a national bank account, which requires a minimum level of monthly income of approximately $507, according to official reports – or even higher.  “That is why many people do not have access to checking accounts, even fewer to U.S. dollar accounts, as it also needs certified documentation that proves you carry out a commercial activity abroad,” Donders added.  Operating with 'uneasy calm'  In 2018, when different crypto exchanges were setting up in Chile, traditional banks like Banco del Estado de Chile, Bank Itaú and Scotiabank, among others, began to close the exchanges' bank accounts due to a “lack of regulation” and “uncontrollable risks of money laundering,” according to some banks’ legal statements at that time. The decision placed cryptocurrency platforms in danger of insolvency and hampered their operations in the country.  Crypto exchanges Buda.com, CryptoMKT and OrionX took the case immediately to the nation's Competition Court, suing 10 of the biggest financial institutions in the country for “abuse of dominant position.” One month later, banks were ordered by the Competition Court to reestablish the exchanges’ bank accounts.  The issue, however, is far from settled. The banks appealed and four years later, the lawsuit continues in the Competition Court. According to exchanges, the trial is in its final stages and banks could be facing $76 million in penalty fees if they lose, OrionX’s Vainstein told CoinDesk.  “The trial has us constantly in tension, but at least now we have a market court decision that gives us some protection, so we operate with a constant uneasy calm,” said Pérez de Castro.  Exchanges seek regulations that will help them gain legal protections, exchange officials told CoinDesk, adding that they expect in its next session Congress will approve a Fintech Law that has been under debate for three years.  Furthermore, Chile’s government plans to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and gathered a team to write a white paper in the first quarter of 2022.

The integration is intended to allow developers to build Web3 projects on the Astar network through Alchemy’s application programming interface (API), product manager Mike Garland told CoinDesk.  Astar allows developers to interact with the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling building on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and utilization of the Polkadot blockchain’s cross-consensus messaging (XCM).  Developers will also be able to partake in decentralized application (dapp) staking, a feature native to Astar. This allows users to vote on their favorite Astar dapps with its native token, ASTR, in order to earn rewards. This will encourage developers to build out apps on the protocol, said Garland.  Alchemy is enthusiastic about supporting Astar because of its “built-in” support for developers seeking to build on the chain, Garland said. “Jumping in and helping bootstrap that ecosystem with our product as well I think is going to go a long way.”  “Rather than spinning up nodes or worrying about memory constraints, this will allow [developers] the capability to really focus on the real world problems they're solving with the dapps they’re building,” Astar CMO Valeria Kholostenko told CoinDesk.  Alchemy, headed by CEO Nikil Viswanathan, has worked to expand its Web3 developer platform in the past year.

42374117,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvXi9R,1659532274,CFTC Would Become Primary Crypto Regulator Under New Senate Committee Plan,"The Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, introduced a bipartisan bill Wednesday that would grant the CFTC ""exclusive jurisdiction"" over cryptocurrency trades that meet commodities law.  The Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act of 2022, sponsored by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and John Thune (R-S.D.), would create a definition of ""digital commodity"" that would include cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether but not anything that may be a security, giving the CFTC the ability to oversee both digital commodity transactions and force registration of digital commodity platforms, according to a section-by-section breakdown of the bill.  The crypto industry has been pushing for either a federal agency or Congress to create a clear definition of “digital commodity” or a digital security, which could give companies greater clarity on when and how they must register with the CFTC or the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bill doesn't provide that definition. The CFTC would have some ability to define digital commodities, and the bill appears to still defer to the SEC on what a security is.  Much of the bill is dedicated to detailing how digital commodity brokers would be treated similarly to their traditional finance counterparts.  At present, most crypto exchanges are regulated at the state level, with no clear federal guidelines for registration or oversight. The SEC has indicated that crypto exchanges listing digital securities should be treated as national securities exchanges.  The SEC, however, has moved slowly, and there is no formal rule-making in progress that would establish a registration requirement.  In the meantime, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam has waged a campaign to have his agency become the primary spot market regulator for the cryptocurrency markets, though Wednesday’s bill doesn't go that far.  Still, Behnam appears to have some lawmaker support on this front. Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.), a member of the House Agriculture Committee, asked Chris Brummer, a professor at Georgetown Law, in June whether the CFTC should “have direct statutory authority to regulate cash markets.”  House Agriculture Committee Republicans have introduced the Digital Commodity Exchange Act, which would also grant the CFTC greater jurisdiction over crypto spot markets, though that too wouldn't grant it exclusive oversight.  The Senate committee, which introduced the latest bill, called for the CFTC to provide more guidance on digital assets earlier this year.  The committee held a hearing on the issue in February that included Behnam, as well as industry experts such as Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the FTX crypto exchange; Perianne Boring, a crypto industry lobbyist; Sandra Ro, CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council; and Kevin Werbach, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.  Coin Center, an industry think tank, published a blog post supporting the bill, saying it would give the CFTC the authority to oversee spot markets rather than have the SEC oversee non-securities exchanges.  However, Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, cautioned that the current definition of “dealer” may be overly broad in the bill’s text.

The collection of 12,000 digital profile picture (PFP) collectibles will be released on the Polygon blockchain, which Miller’s team chose for its low transaction costs, with watercolor-inspired artwork visually similar to the World of Women collection.  Miller has long fancied herself a pioneer of experimenting with new technologies, first launching her astrology website in 1995, during the early days of the internet.  While the majority of Miller’s following knows little about crypto, the entrepreneur says she sees NFTs as the next wave of community building, similar to how she saw the internet boom of the late 90s and adoption of e-books in the early 2000s.  In an interview with CoinDesk Miller said that when she was first introduced to NFTs, ""it felt like I entered a subculture that was like landing in Area 51.""  “When my friends talk about NFTs, they say it's like art you can’t put on the wall. In the beginning, I think NFTs did start as art, but it’s evolved into more of a community passport,"" she added.  Miller has amassed an impressive virtual following since the launch of her website, which sees over 1 million unique visitors per month. The astrologer and her team are now experimenting with Discord as a means of community building. Since being announced last week, her server has garnered up to 2,850 members with holders of her NFTs being granted access to their own token-gated channel.  Having developed an interest in NFTs from seeing numerous high-profile partnerships in the news, Miller’s team tapped Web3 the production agency CYNOSUR3 and the Web3 platform Moonwalk for the collection’s back end.  “I know all the fashion houses are doing them, the music people, the NFL even. I think it's something that's bubbling underground that's going to surface, just like the driverless cars,” Miller said.  Miller’s foray into NFTs echoes how a growing number of corporate entities have approached the technology – hype. NFT partnerships have high upside for relatively low risk, even when catered to non-crypto native consumers.

For example, the global second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), is staging a solid bounce back. Over the past few days, Ether has progressively increased as it surges to $1,774 in its market. This has created a new phase for the crypto assets with more growing impressive within the industry. From the perspective of Raoul Pal, a crypto expert, Ethereum is likely to display continuous price growth across the $2,000 level. Also, its increase in value would create entry points for more investors in the token&apos;s hedge funds, retails, and even institutional investments. The crypto expert&apos;s presumption comes from the continuous price rise of Ether and its derivatives. However, with its upward moves, the fundamentals of the token remained formidable. Recently through a tweet, investment strategist Pal stated that cryptocurrencies would excel over other digital assets. The general feeling is that the macro is so bad that there needs to be a new low or a re-test of the low. But my hunch is that the path of MAX PAIN is higher.

It also said it completed a $4 million capital raise to enable further development of its core GaloyMoney bitcoin banking platform.  Stablesats is intended to provide an alternative to current stablecoin infrastructure and regular-way bank integration by using derivatives contracts to create a bitcoin-backed synthetic dollar pegged to the U.S. dollar.  The company believes that allowing dollars to flow through bitcoin (BTC) will help solve short-term volatility price risk, which currently stands as one of the biggest hurdles to the growth of bitcoin as a means for casual payments.  “Bitcoin has brought digital transactions to previously unbanked communities across Latin America, Africa and beyond,” said Galoy CEO Nicolas Burtey in a press release. “However, its volatility makes managing financial obligations difficult. With Stablesats-enabled Lightning wallets, users are able to send from, receive to, and hold money in, a [U.S. dollar] account in addition to their default BTC account. While the dollar value of their BTC account fluctuates, $1 in their USD account remains $1 regardless of the bitcoin exchange rate.”  More funding for open-source projects  In addition to announcing Stablesats, Galoy announced a $4 million capital raise to enable further development of its core GaloyMoney bitcoin banking platform, a versatile application programming Interface (API) and an enterprise-ready Lightning Network gateway intended to allow organizations easy access to Lightning payments.  Hivemind Ventures led the round with participation from Valor Equity Partners, Timechain, El Zonte Capital, Kingsway Capital, Trammell Venture Partners and AlphaPoint.  “Galoy dramatically lowers the barrier for any community or organization to become its own bank and plug into the world’s first open monetary and payments standard,” said Max Webster, founder of Hivemind Ventures.  “Because it’s open source,"" he added, ""Galoy’s platform benefits from a flywheel effect that can make it the Schelling point for banking software: Each new customer’s implementation improves the security, reliability and capability for all present and future customers.”  How Stablesats works  In line with Galoy’s open-source ethos, the underlying code for Stablesats can be reviewed on GitHub and on its own dedicated website.  To create the synthetic USD, Stablesats uses a financial instrument invented by the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange called a perpetual inverse swap using perpetual futures contracts. Futures contracts are a type of agreement to buy or sell a specific asset (such as bitcoin) at a set future date for a set price. Perpetual futures contracts differ in that they are perpetual and don’t specify a future date.  In 2015, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes – who in May was sentenced to two years of federal probation after pleading guilty to charges he willfully failed to implement an anti-money-laundering program at BitMEX – summarized how a synthetic USD powered by futures could work using his exchange. It involves 1) buying bitcoin, 2) selling a futures contract that locks in current U.S. dollar value of that bitcoin and 3) buying enough futures to maintain balance after spending some of the same bitcoin.  In short, if you buy or sell the appropriate derivatives that change in value in perfectly opposite directions, the holder can hedge the risk of price fluctuations and guarantee the value of their position in U.S. dollar terms. Hayes also outlined how a bitcoin-backed stablecoin could work earlier this year.  Stablesats works similarly using the OKX exchange, and the specific methodology is outlined on GitHub.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/03/banking-platform-galoy-raises-4m-for-bitcoin-backed-synthetic-dollar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03b5f49eae51a154a14501ab9e4aa4b052bc1f3d-541x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393813,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBMYR,1659526200,Goerli Is Coming: Ethereum’s Last Rehearsal Before the Merge,"As we are entering the final weeks leading up to the Merge, there are only a few more tests left to ensure that Ethereum’s proof-of-work (PoW) protocol transitions smoothly to its Beacon proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. The most anticipated event for Ethereum besides the Merge is happening next week; the merge of its third and final test network environment, called Goerli. and the largest community merge.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Goerli is expected to transition to PoS sometime between Aug. 6 and Aug. 12, though this could change depending on how fast the hashrate functions. While many will have their eyes on the September Merge date, this last test will set the stage for what happens on the Ethereum mainnet.  Just last week, Ethereum developers announced the parameters for which the Goerli merge will occur. The test is a two-step process, with the first step happening most likely today or tomorrow (August 3-4). This first step is known as Bellatrix, which is when Goerli’s Beacon Chain, Prater, upgrades in preparation for the testnet merge. Bellatrix will be completed at epoch 112,260. Once Bellatrix is activated, it will next merge with Goerli when it hits a Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) of 10,790,000. After the two merge, Goerli will continue to run as a PoS blockchain.  But the functions of this merge differ greatly from previous testnet merges. Today, Goerli runs under proof-of-authority (PoA), which is a protocol where machines earn the right to generate new blocks by passing a strict vetting process. As a result, trustworthy validation machines protect PoA blockchains. These system moderators are pre-approved participants who check blocks and transactions.  Given that Goerli is PoA, it will be a lot harder to estimate when the actual testnet merge will happen. On the Ethereum Foundation Discord channel, Tim Beiko, the Protocol Support Lead for the Ethereum Foundation, noted that “it's hard to predict the behavior of the merge” under this type of consensus mechanism. This is because under PoA you can’t ramp up hash power, so the volatility in incremental difficulty per block makes estimating the window for the TTD harder, hence why Ethereum developers have given such a large window for the Goerli merge.  This sort of rough timing estimation will also be the case for the eventual Ethereum mainnet merge. Once we have the clear go-ahead on an end-of-September Merge, we can expect developers to project a long estimated Merge activation window. In true Ethereum fashion, the Merge will happen whenever it happens.  Not only is the upcoming merge different from previous testnet merges Sepolia and Ropsten because of the type of consensus mechanism they use, but it also differs in the way that it will be executed. Sepolia and Ropsten were largely successful, thus giving developers the confidence that the PoW transition to PoS will not endure any big hiccups.  Sepolia is a newer, smaller testnet, with little activity and a permissioned beacon chain. So developers decided to first have a go on Sepolia because it would be easier to transition. Goerli, on the other hand, is one of the largest testnets for Ethereum, with a ton of activity already happening on it. This final testnet will give developers a lot of data on many fronts, and its merge and code will mimic the real performance of Ethereum’s mainnet as closely as possible. The outcome of Prater and Goerli will set the stage for the weeks leading up to the end of September.  But this testnet merge also differs in two other ways. First, the node operators will have to update their Consensus Layer and Execution Layer at the same time, rather than one at a time as was done in previous testnet merges. Second, Bellatrix and Goerli are activated and will merge, which allows for the Goerli chain to continue on. As of now, the Goerli testnet will be part of the Ethereum ecosystem for the long term, even in a post-merge world. Developers will be encouraged to use Goerli testnet when testing new protocols.  While this will be the last testnet to happen before the official Merge, Ethereum developers will use every opportunity it gets to continue to test smaller devnets and shadow forks, leading up to the main event. Ethereum’s Merge has been delayed time and time again in an effort to get the process right, rather than rush through the transition. This approach has allowed developers to safely practice node operations, perform upgrades and backups and remove validators while tackling the complexity and unprecedented move of changing the blockchain mechanism.  Assuming that no issues arise during the Goerli-Prater merge, we can expect the announcement of the parameters, as well as the timeline for the mainnet Merge, to come out soon. This will close the final chapter before the yearslong anticipated event.  There was some talk during a Consensus Layer call that there could be an MEV-boost failure, but Ethereum developers noted that the risk is very low, and they are working at implementing a temporary solution in the meantime..  So buckle up, folks, the final chapters of the pre-Merge era are coming to a close, and then the next phase of a post-Merge Ethereum is around the corner. Of course, this will not be the end of work for Ethereum developers. Their next set of challenges will aim to make Ethereum more scalable and more secure.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week.

Validated takes  Ether overtook bitcoin in the options markets for the first time on record.  WHY IT MATTERS: At the time of the writing, the cumulative dollar value of open interest in ether options on dominant exchange Deribit was $5.7 billion, or 32% higher, than $4.3 billion locked in open bitcoin options trades. “While some may be uncertain of the outcome of the Merge, at Deribit, we see a lot of post-Merge options open interest being created. Overall, put-call ratio is at a year low, indicating bullish momentum,” said Deribit Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers. Read more here.  ETH and BTC trading volumes converged for the first time.  WHY IT MATTERS: For the first time this year, ether’s market share of trading volume achieved 50% parity with bitcoin’s, according to data provided by Kaiko. “This could be because of FOMO from investors of ETH 2.0 or because there is already a change in tendency,” said Pablo Jodar, financial products manager at Storm Partners. “In the next bull market, maybe we will see a change in market dominance.” Read more here.  Aave user activity rose to a 2022 high.  WHY IT MATTERS: Daily active addresses or wallets that made transactions climbed above 1,860 on July 18, IntoTheBlock and CoinMetrics data showed. The activity likely came as users voted on a motion to introduce GHO, Aave’s yield-generating stablecoin. The proposal was passed by the community over the weekend, and as soon as the token is launched, users will be able to mint GHO against a diversified set of cryptocurrencies. IntoTheBlock said in a tweet, “On-chain activity for the $AAVE token is in an up-trend.” Read more here.  After the Merge, Ethereum will only be about 55% complete.  WHY IT MATTERS: Despite many perceiving the Merge as the grand finale for the network, Vitalik Buterin shared that Ethereum, post-Merge, will be tackling “the Surge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge.” The “Surge” refers to Ethereum introducing systems that will make the network more scalable by enabling the creation of layer 2 products, while the “Verge” will optimize storage and reduce node sizes through the introduction of Verkle trees. The “Purge” aims to reduce, or “purge,” sparse historical data to make the validation process more efficient, and the “Splurge” is described as “the fun stuff” that makes sure the network continues to run smoothly. Read more here.  Ankr released software development kits (SDK) that would allow developers to offer token staking and yield farming to users of their projects and platforms.  WHY IT MATTERS: Ankr’s SDKs will be offered on the Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche and Fantom networks at first. Once integrated, developers can allow users to stake tokens and earn rewards in return for a liquid staking token. Liquid staking allows users to earn a yield on their locked tokens by issuing new tokens with an equivalent value to the locked ones, freeing up capital. Read more here.

The crypto market saw a setback in price after Bitcoin (BTC) saw a retracement back to a key support area leading to a drawback to the likes of Rune, but the market state indicates Rune could be set for a rally. Rune Weekly Chart Analysis The price of Rune has seen a continuous downtrend from a high of $12 to a low of $1.6 in weeks for what seems to be more than an 80% decline. After finding a low at $1.58, it has started making a move with buyers stepping in; Rune has formed strong support at $1.6 with a weekly resistance of $3.7 Major resistance on the weekly chart - $3.7 Major support on the weekly chart - $1.6 Rune Daily Chart Analysis The daily chart for Rune price shows a rising trend after falling to $1.58. Haven struggled for days to reclaim important support on the daily chart; Rune is finally showing relief as it aims to reclaim significant support just above the 50 exponential moving average (EMA). Although Rune still trades below the 200 exponential moving average (EMA), it gives a sense of relief that on the low timeframe, Rune is doing well. A reclaim above the 200 EMA could send Rune higher. Rune has resistance at $2.85; a breakout and close above this region could send Rune to a region of $3.3, should there be a pullback for the price of Rune, we would see a retest of the daily support at $2.45.

In June, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey echoed negative sentiment about cryptocurrencies in comments to Parliament, saying the asset class has no “intrinsic value.”  The Ethereum blockchain has generated about $3.9 billion in transaction fees so far this year and generated about $9.9 billion in fees last year. Last year's total was 1,558% more than the year before, the report published Friday said.  The Bitcoin blockchain has produced around $93 million in fees year to date, compared with about $1 billion for all of last year, the report added.  Ethereum transaction fees likely declined year to date as holders “moved to the sidelines,” the bank said. Bitcoin fees have probably fallen since April 2021 because of the adoption of the Lightning Network, which allows for smaller and instant bitcoin (BTC) payments.  Bank of America says it is not yet able to forecast cash flows for blockchains because they are unpredictable in the “nascent industry."" Blockchains generate cash flows via transaction fees from validating native token transactions or by validating transactions from applications that run on top of the blockchain.  Cash flows in the form of transaction fees are expected to accelerate for blockchains that have strong user growth and development in addition to a clear use case, the note said.

Key Technical Points: The Curve Dao (CRV) price action teases a bullish turnaround as the lower price rejection candles form at the support trendline. The previous bear cycle from the resistance trendline accounts for an 18% drop in the last five days. With a market cap of $703 million, the intraday trading volume of Curve Dao has increased by 32% to reach $228 million. Past Performance of CRV As predicted in our previous article, the CRV prices beat the then opposing 100-day SMA to reach the resistance trendline slightly above the $1.50 mark. After that, however, the buyers lose trend control due to the increased supply pressure at the psychological mark of $1.50. This bearish turnaround tests the support trendline and accounts for an 18% price fall last week. But the recent lower price rejection candles near the support trendline and the 100-day SMA projects a high possibility of a bull cycle. Source - Tradingview CRV Technical Analysis As the CRV price trend prepares for a bull cycle, the spike in intraday trading volume reflects an increased bullish commitment. However, a candle closing below the support trendline will initiate a bearish downfall. With the bear cycle clinging to the 100-day SMA, the bullish influence grows over the 50-day SMS resulting in a positive turnaround.

42422593,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nQPh,1659515832,Solana's SOL Token Holds Price Support Despite Hack,"Solana's SOL token held on to a critical support level early Wednesday even as a multimillion-dollar hack in the platform saw several investors vent frustration, saying they would consider shorting the cryptocurrency.  The exploit saw an unknown attacker drain at least $5 million worth of SOL, SPL and other Solana-based tokens from the Phantom and Slope digital wallets.  The hack drew the investor community's ire, with several Twitter participants calling a short position in SOL. A trader initiates a short position by selling a borrowed security or its derivative (futures contract) in the expectation of buying it back later at a lower price.  While SOL is trading weaker in the wake of the news, so far sellers have failed to penetrate the token's 50-day simple moving average (SMA) support at $37.50. At press time, the token changed hands at $38.50, a 4% drop in the past 24 hours.  SOL's losses appear to be muted, considering hacks and exploits have historically led to double-digit price slides in tokens associated with victim crypto platforms. Even so, the hack is terrible optics for the world's fifth-largest smart contract blockchain, which promises faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum. Solana's several network outages in the past 12 months have already dented its appeal as an alternative to the Ethereum blockchain.  What's helping the token stay resilient? According to observers, SOL's oversold status and continued holding by large investors, or whales, seem to be supporting the cryptocurrency.  Mumbai, India-based crypto asset management firm MintingM said: ""The SOL supply is controlled by whales and it appears they are holding on to their coin stash.""  The muted response echoes the aftermath of June's disruption to the Solana-based borrowing and lending service Solend.  On June 19, Solend users voted to take over the protocol's largest account: A whale whose extremely large margin position was getting close to liquidation. The move aimed at mitigating liquidation risk was heavily criticized on social media as being the antithesis to the concept of decentralized or democratized finance. Yet, SOL jumped over 6% on the same day and gained another 20% in the following six days.

Key Technical Points: The AAVE (AAVE) price action shows a bear cycle within the rising channel, taking support at the 100-day SMA. The bear cycle cracks under the psychological mark of $100, teasing a downtrend continuation. With a market cap of $1.341 billion, the intraday trading volume of AAVE has dropped by 2.84% to reach $222 million. Past Performance of AAVE As predicted in our previous article, the AAVE prices exceed the psychological mark of $100, resulting in the breakout of the 100-day SMA. However, the higher price rejection above $100 results in an early bearish reversal before reaching the resistance trendline. Currently, the downtrend breaks under $100 but takes support at the 100-day SMA, avoiding a high momentum downfall. The ongoing bear cycle accounts for an 8% price drop in the last six days, but the recent lower price rejection teases an uptrend continuation. Source - Tradingview AAVE Technical Analysis The bullish trend possibility increases as the AAVE price avoids a drop below $90 with significant low price rejection. However, the traders must wait for the market price to break above $100 before taking a bullish trade.

Key Technical Points: The Bitcoin Gold (BTG) prices show lower price rejection resulting in a jump of 11.46% in the last 24 hours. The last night reversal is a successful retest of the rounding bottom breakout with a neckline at $26.55. With a market cap of $523 million, the Bitcoin Gold prices are trading 68% lower than the 52-week high of $94.49. Past Performance of BTG As warned as a possibility in our previous article, the BTG prices show a bearish reversal from the $37 resistance level to retest the $26.5 support level. Hence the bitcoin gold prices are down by 18% over the last four days, but due to last night&apos;s lower price rejection, the 24-hour percentage change is +11%. Furthermore, the lower price rejection successfully retests the bullish breakout of a rounding bottom pattern.

42422578,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0nQ1h,1659486590,Solana Wallets Targeted in Latest Multimillion-Dollar Hack,"The Solana ecosystem appears to be the victim of crypto’s latest exploit, with users reporting their funds have been drained without their knowledge from major internet-connected “hot” wallets including Phantom, Slope and TrustWallet.  The attack is still ongoing, and over 8,000 wallets have been compromised thus far, according to blockchain auditors OtterSec. Several Solana addresses have been linked to the attack (1, 2, 3, 4), with those wallets amassing at least $5 million worth of SOL, SPL and other Solana-based tokens from unsuspecting users.  The exact cause of Tuesday evening's attack remained unclear throughout the night, though it appears to have predominantly impacted mobile wallet users. The attacker somehow obtained the ability to sign (i.e., initiate and approve) transactions on the behalf of users, suggesting a trusted third-party service may have been compromised in a so-called supply chain attack.  Engineers across several networks have found that the bug isn't connected with Solana core code, but in software used by several software wallets, according to a tweet by SolanaStatus.  The attack will inevitably reignite a long-running debate around the security of hot wallets, which stay connected to the internet at all times in order to provide users a convenient way to send, store and receive crypto. Cold wallets – USB drives that must be plugged into a computer to sign transactions – are heralded as a more secure, albeit less convenient, alternative.  ""We are evaluating the incident impacting Solana wallets and are working closely with other teams in the ecosystem to get to the bottom of this. We will issue an update once we gather more information,” a representative of Phantom, the largest Solana hot wallet, told CoinDesk in a statement. “The team doesn't believe this is a Phantom-specific issue at this time.”  Some users initially suspected the hack could be related to transactions on Magic Eden’s Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, though this link became less clear as the attack wore on. The marketplace tweeted a warning for users to revoke wallet permissions for any suspicious links to avoid being attacked. It also suggested users ""[m]ove everything to a cold wallet/ledger.""  Twitter continues to be flooded with reports of Solana users noticing that tokens have suddenly been drained from their accounts.  “I was getting my sunglasses refit when I got a push notification from my mobile wallet that I had sent all the SOL from my wallet,” Solana community member @gostak_gm told CoinDesk. “It was my main hot wallet, so I had it connected to lots of different mobile and web extension wallet providers as well as a lot of dapps. Not clear to me what could have been the root cause. Glad to have most of my funds on a cold wallet.”  It is unclear at this point whether the vulnerability is limited to the Solana blockchain. A TrustWallet and Slope wallet user reported losing USDC on both Solana and Ethereum.  Solana – the fifth-largest blockchain by total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama – has grown in popularity over the past year owing to its quick transactions and low fees. Its native token, SOL, dropped 4% in the hours following the attack.  UPDATE (Aug. 3, 2022, 00:41 UTC): Adds additional information.  UPDATE (Aug. 3, 2022, 01:30 UTC): Adds additional information.
