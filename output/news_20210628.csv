Twenty-year-old Ameer Cajee and 17-year-old Raees Cajee are thought to have vanished in April after sending an email to investors telling them the platform had been “hacked,” and shuttering Africrypt’s website.

42434656,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsU7h,1624912056,Market Wrap: Cryptocurrencies Rise Despite Binance UK Warning,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly higher Monday despite regulatory crackdowns in the U.K. and China. Bitcoin was trading at around $34,000 at press time and is up 4% over the past 24 hours.      On Saturday, the Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K’s financial regulator, warned that Binance Markets Ltd., an affiliate of Binance, is not allowed to undertake any regulated activities without prior written approval. The announcement preceded a nearly 13% drop in bitcoin over the weekend, although buyers were quick to defend support at the $30,000 level.      Bitcoin is down about 40% since April, on track for the largest two-month price drop since November 2018.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $34409.44 +4.64%  Ether (ETH) $2110.96, +15.66%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4291.8, +0.26%  Gold: $1778.36, +0.38%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.472%, compared with 1.53% on Friday    “To be clear, Binance has not been banned from the U.K,” wrote Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics, in a newsletter published on Monday. “This in no way indicates a policy shift from the U.K. regulators regarding crypto assets.”      Other analysts point to improving technicals as bullish.      Last week’s close on the weekly price chart provided a “bullish signal indicating possible trend reversal,” wrote Alexandra Clark, a trader at U.K. digital asset broker GlobalBlock.    Bear market drawdown    Bitcoin’s ""drawdown,"" or the percentage decline from peak to trough, is currently around 45%, according to data provided by Koyfin. The previous bear market in 2018 reached a drawdown of 80% and took about two years to fully recover.      Typically, bitcoin suffers sharp but quick drawdowns prior to a bear market similar to 2017 and earlier this year. Eventually, sellers gain control as price shifts from an uptrend to a downtrend.      For now, some analysts expect bitcoin to remain in a range of between $30,000 and $40,000. “We expect BTC consolidation to continue for next few weeks until a decisive move takes place,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      “If the global macro environment deteriorates on account of decreasing pace of global liquidity, it’s expected BTC may break the crucial level of $30K and challenge the highs of the previous cycle at $20K,” Balani wrote. “Until then, BTC is likely to be in this range and can set up a classic bull trap above $42K.”    Bitcoin miner revenue drop    Miner revenue has collapsed during the crypto sell-off and amid regulatory pressure from China. “The mining market has experienced an approximately 65.5% decline in revenues since levels sustained in March and April,” Glassnode wrote in a newsletter published on Monday.      “The 7-day average mining revenue currently sits at around $20.73M/day, which in context, is still 154% higher than it was at the time of the back-to-back halvings in 2020” the data firm wrote.    Mining difficulty adjustment    China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies has been a blow for bitcoin mining companies and pools based in the country, with some hit harder than others. But for active miners in other parts of the world, it might be good news.      Bitcoin’s mean hash rate – a measure of the computational power working to secure the blockchain network – fell to 94 EH/s on Sunday, the lowest since May 2020, according to Glassnode. Meanwhile, the bitcoin mining difficulty could see a 25% drop at the next reset, likely on July 3, based on Glassnode’s estimates.      A downward adjustment of that size could be the largest in the Bitcoin network’s 12-year history, according to Compass Mining.      With the hash power declining and most Chinese miners going offline, the business should become easier and potentially more profitable for miners that are still active, according to Sam Doctor, chief strategy officer at BitOoda, a digital asset financial services platform.    Ethereum funds see record outflows    Net outflows from cryptocurrency funds totaled $44 million for the week ended on Friday, marking the fourth consecutive week of redemptions.      Ethereum products saw net outflows of $50 million last week, the largest on record since 2015, according to a report by CoinShares published Monday. The movement marks a reversal from the trend so far in 2021, with Ethereum-focused products having garnered a net of $943 million for the year to date as investors diversified away from bitcoin.    Altcoin roundup  QUARLES ON STABLECOINS: Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Randal Quarles said at a bankers conference in Utah on Monday that the U.S. should find ways to say “yes” to stablecoins. The speech stood in contrast to recent comments from Fed officials, such as Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, that have warned that stablecoins could pose a risk to consumers and businesses.  SAFEDOLLAR HIT: SafeDollar, a decentralized finance (DeFi) stablecoin based on the Polygon blockchain, has been hit by a cyberattack. All activities on SafeDollar have been paused and investigations are underway, while the value of SafeDollar has dropped to $0.

42434657,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsU5h,1624911788,Lobsters in Decentraland: Artist Philip Colbert Enters the Metaverse,"Before Philip Colbert became a famous contemporary artist, he had to become a lobster. A big, red cartoon-y lobster.      Born in Scotland, with Irish relatives and now living and working in London, Colbert has been called the ""Godson of Andy Warhol.""For those not familiar with his work, to please visit his website (""Neo Pop Surrealist"") to get this reference explained. If you are not so inclined, know that his work is a mixture of Old Master themes combined with contemporary art theory. And lobsters, lots of them.      Disclosure: Colbert does not look like a lobster. He has not eaten lobster, ever. He has no lobster friends. He likes the 2015 film ""The Lobster,"" a surreal black comedy/dystopian film by Yorgos Lanthimos, but felt cheated there were no actual lobsters in it. If he remakes the film, he vows to rectify this oversight.    Jillian Godsil is an award-winning journalist, author and broadcaster. Her latest book is ""Persons of Interest.""    He has also never heard of Irish lobsters. So, being Irish, I have to tell him.      That story goes like this. An American couple are dining at a posh seafood restaurant in Dublin. There is a tank of live lobsters and the sides seem low. They ask the maître d’ if some of the larger ones are in danger of escaping. “Oh no,” he replies, “they are Irish lobsters.”      The American couple are confused but the maître d’ tells them to watch. Soon one of the larger lobsters battles his way to the edge of the tank. He looks big enough and powerful enough to escape, but just as he is about to lob himself out of the tank and to freedom the other lobsters pull him back in.      Irish lobsters.      Colbert’s fascination with lobsters has propelled him into international artistic fame and won him patronage from leading collectors Charles Saatchi and Simon De Pury. His contemporary art is lobster-driven and increasingly tech-based.    Read more: The People of Decentraland Will Greet You Now | Jeff WIlser    During the coronavirus lockdown he was concerned about people locked into their homes, not being able to get out. In a 2020 exhibition in Saatchi Gallery, he installed robots to take the place of people. These mobile units, plasma screens mounted on a mobile unit and human height, could be booked and used by virtual visitors to move around the exhibition space in tandem with real humans. They were not shaped like lobsters.      This month he is venturing into the metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFT), a combination that makes utter sense to the lobster-inspired artist.      He is not alone. At a recent exhibition, friends witnessed a lobster cult visiting and worshipping his art. They videoed the cult in action and sent it to Colbert.      “This got me thinking,"" he said. ""Art is about ideas and creating an immersive world. Maybe not as a cult, but a metaverse seems the next ideological step for an artist to truly create their world.”      And where does a lobster live when not in the sea or the gourmet’s tank? In Lobsterland, of course, and more recently in Lobsteropolis, housed in the virtual world of Decentraland.    Read more: Why Surrealist Philip Colbert Is Tapping ’80s Band Devo to Bring Lobsters to the Metaverse    Colbert believes the idea is more important than the execution. He understands that an artist creates a world but what if the visitor could actually enter the world and hang out. This is what a metaverse, or virtual shared space, is made for.      His world, Lobsteropolis in Lobsterland is big: 57 plots in all. It’s not as big as London but it’s a pretty big space. It is not just a gallery, it is home to a museum, a record shop, a university, a live concert venue, coffee shops, a bank and more. He has a skyscraper he’d like to rent out to the other artists to create an art village. For his launch this month, he has teamed up with another big landowner in Decentraland, Vegas City.      On June 30, he is hosting an official opening with celebrity American band Devo as he guests. He has always loved Devo – and their hats. The lobster in him sees their hats as a fitting accompaniment.      The other guest of honor is Simon De Pury, art collector maven, who will auction a specially prepared video NFT in conjunction with Devo. Colbert sees the hybrid of art and music in a metaverse as the absolute obvious conclusion for today’s technology.      Come, he says, hang out.      Fitting in with the theme, I’ll be going as a starfish.      The following has been edited for clarity and brevity.      CoinDesk: Why a metaverse?      Colbert: “I've had this opportunity for people to come into this lobster world and slightly bend the boundaries of perception of what the art is, trying to create a more holistic, malleable, interactive art experience.      “When the lockdown occurred I felt it was the perfect opportunity to push my digital world. Because when people couldn't travel and stuff, then obviously you have a more captive audience than ever.      “This year the rise of the NFTs further incentivized me to bring it online because, in a way, it just makes it accessible for people who are not just at my exhibition, because it's globally accessible.""      “I can imagine Decentraland becoming the closest we have to a global metaverse. Loads of artists and musicians and thinkers and creatives and young aspiring individuals can go and live some weird crypto dream where the American Dream is served by avatars.”    Read more: Daryl Morey on Crypto and NFTs: ‘It’s the Start of a Major, Major Trend’    You say ideas are everything.      “Our idea is the value of everything is abstract. We connect it to materially but, ultimately, the true value lies in it is in the story, the narrative, the idea, the provenance.      “Obviously, that doesn't take away from the physicality of paint, texture of certain paint on canvas and stuff. But ultimately, the Holy Grail is the idea. The Holy Grail is the narrative, the story.      Is video art valuable?      “I see this opportunity to create a democratic platform for video art, because video art has always never really had any commercial viability or platform in the way that painting or sculpture has had.      “Video art has always been sort of slightly under the table. And, yet, it is obviously a very refined art form in the 21st century. NFTs give a platform to video and digital art. As a painter, I'm heavily inspired by video and 3-D software in the creation of paintings. Because for me, it's that hybrid of new technology to create a new possibility in visual painting language, which I find really interesting.      “NFTs are the perfect platform to take this new dynamic of artistic expression. It certainly exploded to begin with which I think was probably just because of the huge enthusiasm; that suddenly people realized that there was a new genre being born.      There is no question that it's here to stay as a part of the pie of what art is; it's definitely now a significant slice of that.”",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MANA | TECHNOLOGY,Jillian Godsil,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/28/lobsters-in-decentraland-artist-philip-colbert-enters-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/706b110c60de5918015e1d5cf1495ae311f81378-1400x1120.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434659,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsU9h,1624910462,"Ethereum Gas Fees at 6-Month Low as Market Cools, Layer 2 Solutions Ease Congestion","Ethereum transaction fees have dropped to their lowest since December because blockchain activity has cooled while use of Ethereum layer 2 solution protocols such as Polygon (MATIC) has heated, according to blockchain data and analysts.      As of June 27, the average transaction fee on the Ethereum blockchain was $4.42, according to data from Coin Metrics. That's down from fee levels above $60 as recently as mid-May.      Gas refers to the computational efforts required to execute specific operations on the Ethereum network. A fee, paid in ether, is required to successfully conduct a transaction on Ethereum. Ethereum is the second-biggest blockchain network after Bitcoin.      High gas fees have been one of the biggest challenges for Ethereum at a time of increasing network usage. Interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) has been surging along with the price of ether.      Analysts told CoinDesk that lower gas fees are a natural response to the crypto market's recent cooldown.      At press time, ether was trading around $2,103.77, less than half of the all-time high at $4,382.73 reached on May 11, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Read more: Polygon Price Climbs to Record High, Benefiting From Ethereum Congestion      Congestion on the Ethereum blockchain has dropped with the cryptocurrency's price. Transactions on the network fell to around 1.1 million on June 27, down from May's high at around 1.7 million, according to Coin Metrics. Data from CoinGecko shows ether's trading volume on exchanges has also come down significantly.      The exchange data is in line with activity on decentralized exchanges (DEX). Data from Dune shows weekly DEX volume has dropped to below $20 billion for the week beginning June 21 from above $40 billion for the week beginning May 17.      Lower gas fees ""means network activity level is not as high,"" Vishal Shah, founder of Alpha5 exchange, said. And because Ethereum is a foundation layer for a lot of DEXs, ""it also implies that there's a lesser amount of speculative volume turning over.""      At the same time, the growing adoption of Ethereum layer 2 solutions such as Polygon has also helped lower Ethereum gas fees, as CoinDesk reported recently. Analysts have seen a ""significant amount"" of users turning from Ethereum to Polygon; many Ethereum-native DeFi protocols such as Aave, Kyber Network and SushiSwap have moved to the protocol recently.      Another factor behind the reduced gas fees is the shift in the types of bots used by ether and DeFi traders, according to Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at Messari.      Traders had previously been using an auction called ""Priority Gas Auction"" (PGA) to bid up the gas fees in order to be the first in line for transactions. They have recently moved to Flashbots, where miners and traders take their communication off the blockchain to private channels.      The ordering of transactions on Ethereum is important, as CoinDesk's research associate Christine Kim wrote in her Valid Pointsnewsletter on May 12. Especially for traders on DEXs, being milliseconds ahead of another trader can mean an opportunity to make thousands of dollars.      Read More: Valid Points: MEV on Eth 2.0: The Good, Bad and Ugly      The cumulative maximal extractable value (MEV), or the amount of money a miner on Ethereum stands to make as a direct result of their ability to insert, leave out and reorder transactions within a block, has declined since the beginning of June, remaining at a little above $700 million, according to Flashbots' MEV dashboard.

42434648,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsTrh,1624910012,Mexico's Finance Minister Confirms Cryptos Are Banned From Financial System,"A top Mexican official reiterated on Monday a ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in the country's financial system.      Arturo Herrera, Mexico's finance minister, said cryptocurrencies aren't legal tender assets and aren't treated as currencies within the country's current regulatory framework.      Those bans are not expected to be lifted in the short term, Herrera said during a presentation to the Financial Action Task Force, a global anti-money laundering group.    Lee este artículo en español.    The announcement comes after a Sunday pronouncement by billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego, a noted bitcoin bull, that he was working to make Banco Azteca the first bank in Mexico to accept the cryptocurrency. Salinas is chairman of Grupo Salinas, the bank's parent company.      Herrera’s comments weren’t explicitly tied to Salinas’ pledge, but came within hours of the businessman’s announcement.      Herrera said his secretariat will publish a four-page communiqué detailing the government's position.      In a joint statement, the Central Bank of Mexico, the finance secretary and the National Banking and Securities Commission specified that cryptocurrencies are neither legal tender assets nor currencies under the current legal framework. In addition, they warned about the risks of using cryptocurrencies.      The document consists of four pages and was characterized by Herrera as ""unusually extensive.”      The three entities reiterated the warnings they issued in 2014, 2017 and 2019 about crypto's risks as a form of exchange, store of value or other form of investment.      In addition, the document said that financial institutions in Mexico are not authorized to deal with virtual assets such as bitcoin, ether, XRP and others, ""in order to maintain a healthy distance between these and the financial system.""      Financial institutions that conduct or offer operations with virtual assets without an authorization will be in violation of the regulations and subject to applicable sanctions, the report added.      Mexico is the headquarters of Bitso, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Latin America. In May, the company raised $250 million in its Series C funding round and reached a $2.2 billion valuation.

42434639,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsTfh,1624907662,Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Drops to 1-Year Low; Difficulty Set for 25% Decrease,"China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies has been a blow for bitcoin mining companies and pools based in the country, with some hit harder than others. However, for active miners in other parts of the world, it might be good news.      Bitcoin’s mean hashrate – a measure of the computational power working to secure the blockchain network – fell to 94 EH/s on Sunday, the lowest since May 2020, according to data from Glassnode. Meanwhile, the bitcoin mining difficulty could see a 25% drop at the next reset, likely on July 3, based on Glassnode's estimates.      A downward adjustment of that size could be the largest in the Bitcoin network's 12-year history, according to Compass Mining.      With the hash power declining and most Chinese miners going offline, the business should become easier and potentially more profitable for miners that are still active, according to Sam Doctor, chief strategy officer at BitOoda, a digital asset financial services platform.      Read more: Iran’s Ministry of Industry Issues 30 Licenses to Crypto Mining Farms      As hashrate declined, the number of daily bitcoin earned for each unit of computational power likely increased, which “certainly would imply more bitcoin” for active miners, according to Doctor. The dollar-equivalent value of the proceeds is harder to predict given the cryptocurrency's notorious price volatility.      Concerns about the extent of the China crackdown have contributed to the past months' decline in bitcoin's price to about $34,200 now, from an all-time high near $65,000 in early April.    Miner migration    The fall in the bitcoin mining hash power is likely to continue, according to BitOoda, which predicts the target hashrate could drop further to 85 EH/s at the subsequent difficulty reset on July 19 or July 20.      “We believe it would take several quarters for the infrastructure deployment to be complete,"" according to BitOoda. ""As a result, hashrate will likely be below our prior forecasts for the next ~10 quarters.”      When will the fall come to an end? It may depend on how the crypto mining industry responds to China's crackdown.      With Chinese miners looking for new places to host mining rigs, North America has attracted enormous interest due to its comparatively lower geopolitical risks, large-scale utility networks and emphasis on environmental, social, and corporate governance, according to Dave Perrill, CEO of Computer North, a cryptocurrency mining colocation company.      “We're seeing a ton of inbound requests from Chinese-based mining companies that are looking to relocate to North America and are looking to do it urgently,” said Perrill. “We're receiving over a hundred megawatts of requests per day.""      Read more: Chinese Bitcoin Mining Company Delivers First Machines to Kazakhstan      “I think in the course of the next 12 to 18 months, over 50% of the hashrate will be in North America,” according to Perrill.      However, the migration takes time, and infrastructure could be a bottleneck.      “We'll see a lot of machines hitting the North American shores and some are just going to be offline for a while until the hosting infrastructure can catch up,"" Perrill said.      According to BitOoda's Doctor, “the concern is that not every miner in China could find a hosting site outside of China.”      Many hosting sites face a shortage of substations and transformers to pair with bitcoin mining rigs coming from China, Doctor noted.      “There aren’t that many sites that are ready for development,” Doctor said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING,Frances Yue,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/28/bitcoin-mining-hashrate-drops-to-1-year-low-difficulty-set-for-25-decrease,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/804bf7f1f55da5769bc7a39e3e60bcd40a993998-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434642,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsTjh,1624906822,Compound Labs Launches 'Treasury' to Get Big Firms Reaping DeFi Yields,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) firm Compound Labs, the creator of the Compound money market on Ethereum, has a new company: Compound Treasury.      It could be one of the most significant developments in “institutional DeFi” to date. While asset managers like Bitwise have packaged DeFi tokens for big investors, few have offered gateways to DeFi’s underlying protocols.      In cooperation with Fireblocks and Circle, Compound Treasury lets neobanks and fintech firms send dollars that are converted into USDC, the dollar-backed stablecoin Circle administers in partnership with Coinbase.      Those USDC tokens will then be deployed on Compound for a guaranteed interest rate of 4%, vastly better than anything firms would get from a savings account or even a certificate of deposit.      ""This is our path to sustainability as a company. … If the interest rates in Compound earn more than 4% over time, the business will make money,” Compound founder Robert Leshner told CoinDesk. ""It's the ability to offer a new financial product that fintechs have been clamoring for.”      According to a blog post shared in advance with CoinDesk, Compound Treasury enables “large holders of U.S. Dollars to access the interest rates available in the USDC market of the Compound protocol, while abstracting away protocol-related complexity including private key management, crypto-to-fiat conversion, and interest rate volatility.”    The math    If it’s hard to understand where a 4% return could come from (current returns on USDC deposits on Compound are 1.67%), it’s important to note that all Compound users are still earning COMP governance tokens (which trade at around $298 as of this writing), and will do so at a consistent rate for about three more years.      So it’s not just whatever yield USDC deposits earn, but also the liquidity mining returns; and if Compound the protocol becomes more important in its multichain future, the COMP earned will become more valuable, allowing Compound Treasury to earn a stronger profit.    Read more: Compound’s New Blockchain Readies DeFi for Central Bank Digital Currencies    That said, Compound Treasury won’t take wild bets to goose returns further, chasing whichever liquidity pool has the most lucrative profits. “It's going to be only stablecoins. Because customers should never be exposed to the risk of cryptocurrencies,” Leshner said.      Compound Treasury will also work more like a normal savings account. Users can get in and out when they want. No commitments to lock up for a certain period.      Other related products have come along recently. Circle just launched Circle Yield, which offers depositors various returns depending on how long they lock in their USDC. Circle also recently rolled out the waitlist-only DeFi API, which is used in the Compound Treasury product. Anchor, from Terraform Labs, is offering 20% returns, but users will need to touch cryptocurrency to access it.      It’s useful here to remind readers that while Compound Labs made the Compound protocol, it doesn’t own it. It may have a large portion of its governance tokens, but many others do as well. So far, no portion of revenues on Compound goes to COMP holders.      From the start, it was always the plan to build the protocol and then build a business atop the protocol that would have a revenue stream, which brings us to Compound Treasury.      “This is what Compound Labs is offering, a dollar on-ramp to the protocol,” Leshner said. “I think this could be shockingly big and shockingly profitable.""",POSITIVE,COMP | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMP | REGULATION | USDC,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/28/compound-labs-launches-treasury-to-get-big-firms-reaping-defi-yields,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af415d005762eb14d782cf868f1c1c198b9e8523-1500x869.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434652,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsTzh,1624905586,A Reckoning for Binance and Other 'Global' Exchanges,"This weekend saw a cluster of enforcement actions or related impacts against Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency retail exchange. They may be a preview of bigger trouble for Binance and other exchanges that have spent years testing the boundaries of financial regulation worldwide.      The first drumbeat came on Friday, when Japan’s Financial Services Authority warned Binance it was providing financial services to Japanese citizens without proper registration. On Saturday, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority issued a similar warning against Binance Markets Ltd., an entity through which Binance has tried to offer regulated U.K. services. Then on Sunday, Binance announced that it would stop offering services in Ontario after the Canadian province issued warnings or actions against the exchanges Bybit, KuCoin and Poloniex.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    Like Binance, those broadly fall into a class of ""global"" crypto exchanges that are widely used in jurisdictions where they are not explicitly licensed to operate. The series of actions this past weekend could be a preview of a sterner worldwide clampdown on that class of crypto exchanges.      Exchanges like KuCoin and Bitfinex have based much of their growth on what’s known as “regulatory arbitrage.” The term refers to the exploitation of differences between laws in different places to evade oversight and control. It can also refer more simply to the exploitation of unclear or weakly enforced regulation.      Uber’s growth was a mainstream example of regulatory arbitrage. In the early to mid-2010s, the ride-hailing giant used technical and legal subterfuge to expand into jurisdictions that had explicitly prohibited its operations, such as Austin, Texas. From such violations grew a $95 billion public company.    Read more: Binance Isn’t Allowed to Be Operating in the UK, Watchdog Warns    In the case of the exchanges, regulatory arbitrage has mainly involved putting headquarters in low-regulation jurisdictions while offering services in restricted countries via the superficial digital wink-and-nod of virtual private network (VPN) software. They also benefited from a period of disinterest from regulators in the developed world that lasted well into 2018. Exchanges that only dealt with crypto and didn’t offer fiat on-ramps, like BitMEX and for a time Binance itself, seemed particularly invisible to regulators.      Though they were nominally barred by law from serving customers in places like the U.S., Binance and others were known to routinely do so anyway. American customers who wanted to buy degen leveraged longs on BitMEX only needed to install VPN software to pretend they were located in, let’s say, Morocco. Exchanges have generally responded to regulator complaints about such activity in full kabuki mode, claiming that their geofencing means they’re not serving customers they’re not supposed to, and simply ignoring clear evidence of the workaround.      This basic situation has persisted even as regulatory scrutiny of global exchanges increased over the course of the recent bull market. Because financial regulation or enforcement are lax in many countries, particularly developing countries, exchanges remain free to facilitate crypto sales or trades to those residents – or anyone who pretends to be one via a VPN. Risks are lowered further if you put your corporate headquarters in a jurisdiction known for taking a lighter regulatory touch. Examples include the Seychelles, the longtime nominal headquarters of BitMEX, and Malta, where Binance’s central headquarters is ostensibly based. Those headquarters are largely for legal purposes: Binance’s operations, for instance, appear to be spread across a nebulous system of offices, itself a bulwark against enforcement.      A spokesman for the U.K.’s financial regulator clarified to Decrypt that the latest ban only formally affects the U.K. subsidiary Binance Markets Ltd., not Binance as a whole. But Binance Markets Ltd. doesn’t currently appear to have any operational services, in the U.K. or anywhere else. Instead, the FCA says Binance Group is still servicing U.K. traders through Binance.com, without any license to do so.      The FCA told Decrypt that ""U.K. consumers can continue to interact"" with Binance services that don’t break U.K. rules, in essence leaving Binance, as it has been, responsible for screening. But that should not be read as a go-ahead for Binance to operate with impunity. The leveraged crypto trading that attracts many users to Binance is definitely illegal in the U.K., and with regulators clearly paying attention, they seem likely to pursue further restrictions and penalties.      As part of its plan to set up regulated U.K. trading, Binance purchased a regulated U.K. entity in 2020. The parent company clearly expected that this would be an easy path to setting up above-board U.K. operations, which it said at the time would be operational by summer 2020. But Binance U.K. never got its regulatory go-ahead, and the new statements appear aimed less at curtailing back-door trading than sending a strong signal that British authorities aren’t eager to let Binance in through the front.      These are all major blows to Binance’s world-straddling ambitions, but more importantly, they signal a continued crackdown on crypto’s biggest scofflaws. This arguably began with the U.S. filing criminal money laundering charges against Arthur Hayes and other executives of BitMEX. While uncertainty, indifference and VPNs have allowed global exchanges to play games with regulators for years, leaders looking at those sorts of personal consequences may finally start to take regulators seriously.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,David Z.

The list came more than a month after the exchange said it would ban futures contracts and some leveraged investment products in “a few specified countries and regions,” as CoinDesk first reported.      The exchange has already barred people in another 11 countries from crypto transactions and provision of related services, according to the new agreement. These countries or regions include the U.S., Canada, Japan, Iran, North Korea and Crimea.      The full list includes the following:    Anyone from mainland China, Taiwan, Israel, Iraq, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Sevastopol and the U.K. (in the U.K., retail investors only) is prohibited from using the derivatives trading services provided by Huobi’s website.  Use of the transaction of digital assets and provision of related services by persons located in the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Crimea is prohibited.    The company declined to comment on the user agreement.      Huobi is the latest exchange to scale back trading services amid an intensifying crackdown on crypto trading on exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) desks in China.      The Chinese government’s notices cited money laundering and excessive speculation in the crypto market as two of the reasons for this wave of crackdowns.      The People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, summoned major commercial banks to reiterate a longstanding ban on dealings with crypto trading platforms on June 21, and singled out OTC trading as one of the services that most needed to be supervised and regulated.      The first official warning this year against crypto trading from China was issued by three financial industry associations on May 18. Another notice by the State Council of China, which is one of the highest central government agencies, escalated the crackdown and triggered Huobi to reduce its trading and mining services.      More telecom fraudsters are turning to crypto to launder their proceeds, according to the Chinese police, while leveraged trading is one of the most risky investments in digital assets.

42434650,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsTxh,1624896652,Crypto Social Networks Aren't Cool,"On Monday, we reported on a $100 million decentralized social network planned to foster a more egalitarian web. Equality is good, but I cannot imagine a world in which this thing is even kind of cool.      The news made me think back on my history in social networks. I go way back. I have watched them come and go and here's what I have learned: Social networks fly when they are cool and only then.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The first social network I ever joined was called SixDegrees, which launched in 1997. It was so long ago that no one even had a name for social networks yet.      SixDegrees was too early, but a few years later I joined Friendster, the first that really popped. Those were weird days and Friendster made a lot of missteps. It was upset by MySpace, which had a very brief moment before Facebook steamrolled it.      In the very early 2000s, lots of other social networks tried, and I took a look at many of them. The only one I remember was called Ringo, but there were others. Lots of people wanted to capture that addictive quality the pioneers had.      It's hard to think of Facebook as cool now, but it was. Mark Zuckerberg was an insouciant young founder. Plus, it was exclusive, only permitting users who had emails at different colleges at first, in order to focus on the young (I snuck in through a back door because I worked at a whitelisted institution). MySpace, for all its sketchiness, was also once cool – its very sketchiness might have been what made it cool. It's hard to say.      That's because it's hard to say where cool comes from – period. But I will tell you this: It's not the blockchain.    Blockchain technology is transformative, it's subversive, it's surprising – but it is not cool.    Blockchain technology is transformative, it's subversive, it's surprising – but it is not cool. Cool isn't trying anything. Cool doesn't wave to get your attention. Cool shrugs if you happen to make eye contact.      Blockchain folks make a lot of gestures, but they never shrug.      And so the industry is littered with abortive social networks and/or zombie networks pleading with the public to care.      Somehow, BitClout remains in the conversation. This site is such a tryhard that it made over 10,000 accounts for people who didn't ask for them. Such eagerness is not cool, which is probably part of why its traffic in May was half its traffic in April, according to SimilarWeb.      The first crypto social network I really looked at closely was Steemit (now Hive) and, while it was always nice, folks were too eager to talk about how they were all going to get rich blogging. This might be the original sin of blockchain social media, because all of them do it. They want, and wanting is never cool.      And then, before Voice.com pivoted to non-fungible tokens, it was so uncool that I'm pretty sure some of the more selective subreddits banned you if you even visited the website once. They would have been able to do it telepathically. That's how uncool that site was!      In this blockchain universe, there is a lot of money, so entrepreneurs keep fooling themselves into believing that they can buy cool, usually in the form of paid celebrity users.      Cool cannot be bought. Cool can't even be transferred. Example: Jay-Z is cool. Tidal is not cool.      The crypto-influential are not cool either. They may have attention. They may get 10,000 retweets on their pithy observations, but that's not cool. If they point at a new social network, the cool kids might look but the cool kids won't stay.    Read more: Social Networks Are the Next Big Decentralization Opportunity | Ben Goertzel    In fact, this story comes full circle. The once-cool Facebook announced the least cool blockchain in the whole history of this industry, Libra. Libra went roughly as well as I expect every crypto social network will go for some time.      I keep watching crypto entrepreneurs try to crack this social network nut and I shake my head. It's too soon. Blockchains can't run a cool social network until blockchains are so widespread that people don't really try them out, they just happen onto them.      Cool kids don't try things. They stroll into them, look around, take off their shades and then just do something because ... ""What the hell? Who cares?"" And it takes off. Cool is emergent. It is unforced.

BaFin announced the news Monday.      Coinbase is the first company to receive the license, BaFin said in a press release.      In November 2019, Germany’s parliament – the Bundestag – passed a law that required firms custodying crypto for Germans to apply for a crypto custody license or leave Germany. Companies that were already operating in the country on Jan. 1, 2020, were required to announce their intent to apply by March 31 of that year and apply by Nov. 30.      Coinbase applied for the license in the late spring of 2020, said Carola Rathke, partner at Eversheds Sutherland, a German law firm that advised Coinbase on the project.      There are other crypto custody applications that are also in the ""advanced stage"" of the review process and will probably receive decisions from BaFin in the coming months, Rathke added. BaFin has no hard deadline for responding to questions and may ask applicants questions or request more documents from them over time.      In response to receiving the license, Coinbase plans to localize its services and expand its product offering in the country, according to a blog post published by the company.      “Being awarded the licence is the culmination of many months of hard work from the Coinbase team, in close collaboration with the BaFin,"" Marcus Hughes, Coinbase’s managing director for Europe, said in the post. ""We look forward to bringing a best-in-class crypto product offering coupled with a secure, localized experience to our German customers.”      The approval comes at a time in which Coinbase is trying to prove itself to be an exchange that embraces regulation after having gone public in the U.S. via a direct listing in April.

42387172,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlprN,1624887000,NFT-Powered Digital Comic Book to Let Fans Decide Heroes' Fates,"In 1988, when fans turned against the second character to wear the costume of Batman's sidekick, Robin, a character named Jason Todd, D.C. Comics set up a telephone poll system to decide whether Todd should live.      Fans voted for that Robin to die, and so the Joker killed him off in Batman #428.      In those halcyon days, there were other analog ways for fans to interact with the comic books they loved, most notably the letter columns printed in the backs of the books. Today, comic publishers have dropped such forums into the oubliette.      Now a new crypto-powered entertainment company aims to bring interactivity back to comics.      Called InterPop, members of its creative team promised there will be similarly crucial decisions for fans to make in its storylines as its lines of comics roll out this year.      InterPop will start off by introducing a bunch of characters in its Emergents universe, starting with a book called The Nine, issue #0 of which will come out July 17.      ""Characters are going to die over the course of this run of comics. And it will be fan decisions that will dictate who those characters are and what shoes they will be wearing,"" Brian David-Marshall, InterPop’s president, said in an interview.      Rachel Gluckstern, the editor of the comics, is a veteran of the big comics publishing houses. She sees fan voting as a slightly more humane way to get feedback ""that doesn't go by sales information,"" she said. It's an internet-era approach that evokes those old days of comic book letter columns. ""This is a way for us to really understand what fans are thinking,"" she said.    Origin story    The characters arose from a digital trading card game (TCG) that's been in the works to run on the Tezos blockchain for some time. Emergents, once housed in Coase, a company founded by Tezos co-founder Kathleen Breitman, transferred the Emergents game's intellectual property assets to InterPop, a subsidiary of Tezos TQ.      Tezos is a top-50 blockchain, with a $2 billion market cap. It ran one of the most successful initial coin offerings in 2017, promising a model of governance that would keep it up to date forever. It went live in late 2018.      InterPop will create digital comics, collectibles and eventually in-game assets when Emergents goes live. All the comics will be available for free, but to take part in decisions about the books, fans will need to own actual issues by buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent particular issues.    Read more: Tezos Co-Founder Turns to Gaming With ‘Hearthstone’ Competitor    The Nine #0 will release with multiple alternative digital covers, including those by well-known artists such as Madman's Mike Allred and The New Mutants' Bill Sienkiewicz.      All of the Interpop comics will be released on its dedicated e-reader web app for free. Those who'd like to get early access should visit the Interpop website and sign up for an online event on July 17. All attendees will get a free comic NFT and a free in-game NFT that will be playable once Emergents launches.    As for Tezos...    The comics, the cards and other collectibles will also be available on a secondary market called Minterpop. While direct purchases in the game and the comics can all be done with fiat currency using traditional payments, transactions on Minterpop will all be done using Tezos' native token, XTZ.      All crypto will lean on the Kukai wallet technology, which the Interpop team said has made great strides in stripping away cryptocurrency's complexity for new users.      The team expects the various Emergents properties will generate a large number of transactions on Tezos, especially if trading for in-game items on the secondary market on Emergents, where it will be encouraged, looks anything like it does in traditional video games, where it's generally discouraged.      The secondary market for in-game assets is an extremely gray one now (if not even a little black), so one can only guess at the estimate, but it's almost certainly in the billions of dollars.    The game    CoinDesk previously reported on Emergents as a game that will use blockchain technology to give users much more control over their card decks and collections and focus less on manipulating players into buying cards they don't want or need. The core ideas are unchanged, but the team behind Emergents says it is now better resourced to deliver the sort of experience that will be competitive with the most popular TCGs.      Blizzard Entertainment's Hearthstone is the leader in the digital space, but the company that invented the underlying concept, Wizards of the Coast, released a mobile version of the classic analog game in March of this year (this reporter may or may not have burnt a considerable amount of time on it since then).      Emergents should be released in the fourth quarter, according to the InterPop team.      Until then, curious players can start getting familiar with the universe by checking out the early comics.      ""We're not really going into this superhero universe on an origin-by-origin issue. We're kind of plopping people down in the middle of it,"" David-Marshall said.",POSITIVE,XTZ,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | XTZ | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/28/nft-powered-digital-comic-book-to-let-fans-decide-heroes-fates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/786ee1412c0c00b785eeb4bdb55036a092431f3d-2026x1358.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Colbert, the ""neo-pop surrealist"" best known for his colorful odes to lobsters, is launching his ""Lobsteropolis City"" and ""Lobster Land Museum"" in Decentraland, seeing the metaverse as a home for non-fungible token (NFT) exhibitions, among other things.      These other things include a musical performance in collaboration with legendary American art rockers Devo, titled ""LOBSTER DE-VO."" The performance will serve as a launch for Colbert’s ""Lobster Land"" on Decentraland on Wednesday. It will feature a DJ set by Devo (a band that probably suits being cast as digital avatars better than any other on the planet).      Devo co-founder Gerald Casale provided the following quote in a press release:    “‘LOB-STER-DE-VO’ Clawing our way into the future. Breaking free. Looking for new traditions. Deevolution is real!”    Doors will open on the Lobster Record store (Colbert plans more musical collaborations; think “Rock Lobster” by the B-52s), and an NFT auction in association with SuperRare, a digital art market, and dealer Simon de Pury will run in conjunction with Decentraland Art Week starting July 8.

Colbert told CoinDesk he began looking at virtual world-building a few years ago, initially with the idea of using VR headsets and the like.      “As the creator, it felt insane to be actually in one’s own painting in a way,” Colbert said. “This heightened sense of experience just felt like a very profound, new way of making things and exploring creativity.”      The onset of the global pandemic gave things more of an other-worldly twist, as public spaces such as galleries were shut down. In response, Colbert held a show at London’s Saatchi Gallery using “telepresence robots"" that could view the exhibition remotely for the public via a mobile phone.      The rise of NFTs early this year prompted Colbert to dive into Decentraland, which now operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governed by token holders. He was put in touch with James Ashton, CEO of Vegas City, one of the largest districts in the Decentraland metaverse, which is hosting Lobsteropolis across its 57 parcels of virtual land.      “I just started translating my world into the Decentraland model,” said Colbert, who has experience in 3D modelling and digital rendering, and who enlisted help from the team at Vegas City in coding everything up. He added:    “Digital art is a great medium, but it’s not doing anything conceptually to further reinvent and recontextualize the possibility of that art. Rather than doing another virtual gallery show, I wanted to make this the experience of going into my actual world.”  Why lobsters?    “Lobsters have an iconic, historical lineage in art,” Colbert said, “from occupying a central position in Dutch still life painting, to later becoming a symbolic protagonist of surrealism.”      Now the colorful crustacean may also find its footing in the metaverse.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | MANA | MARKET | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/28/why-surrealist-philip-colbert-is-tapping-80s-band-devo-to-bring-lobsters-to-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3769d927ccf23a2210e693f6736bd673987500c-1500x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The figure compares with last year's $923 million, according to the firm who told CoinDesk via email the leap represents a 612% increase year-over-year.      The surge demonstrates a shift in thinking among the country's youngest investors away from the precious metals that older generations in the country typically favor, Bloomberg reported Monday.      “I’d rather put my money in crypto than gold,” said entrepreneur Rishi Sood, who was cited in the report. “Crypto is more transparent than gold or property and returns are more in a short period of time.”      More than 15 million Indians are now trading crypto, roughly 8 million fewer than in the U.S. and many more than the U.K.'s 2.3 million, according to the report.      Despite the regulatory roller coaster Indians have faced from the country's central bank, courts, and political corridors, crypto is beginning to take root in the country of 1.33 billion.

The Tesla founder said it is important to support a reduction in DOGE transaction fees.  His tweet was in response to a proposal by dogecoin developer Patrick Lodder to reduce fees to 0.01 DOGE in order for the crypto to remain competitive.  The current recommended fee of 1 DOGE has ""become steep for the perceived value of transacting dogecoin,"" and is ""disincentivizing on-chain transactions unnecessarily,"" Lodder wrote on GitHub, a website where software developers share codes, development tools and ideas.  Lodder argues that whereas DOGE transactions used to be 10 times cheaper than litecoin's, they are now nearly five times more expensive.  DOGE's price subsequently rallied to above $0.26.

Prices Monday were slightly higher, with one bitcoin fetching about $35,000 at press time, CoinDesk 20 data show. One expert said more is needed to continue driving gains in the current climate of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD).      On Friday, the world's first cryptocurrency fell more than 8% despite rallying 5% during the Asian trading session, bolstered by news of El Salvador's confirmed date of its bitcoin law and a $30 bitcoin airdrop to every Salvadoran adult who downloads bitcoin's app.      ""An unprecedented stream of FUD has resulted in bitcoin struggling to keep above water,"" Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk via WhatsApp on Monday.      Chu also said the short-term outlook remains ""choppy and uncertain,"" despite the recent bounce back above $34,000. ""With retail investors on the sidelines licking their wounds, volumes will struggle until the next price catalyst.""      Indeed, daily trading volume for bitcoin has remained low, particularly during the weekend. That's been the trend for most of the month.      The weak trading volume points to a lack of institutional and retail interest, Chu said, citing undisclosed trading teams he has had conversations with.      Meanwhile, other notable cryptos are coasting in bitcoin's slipstream, with ether and internet computer both advancing over a 24-hour period.      In traditional markets, Asian equities were mostly up, with the exception of Japan's Nikkei 225 Index, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and the Australian All Ordinaries Index, which were all down by less than half a percent.

It’s a good match: Nivaura has gone deep when it comes to tokenizing securities, working closely with partners like the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). DBS, with the support of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), is a leader when it comes to institutional involvement in cryptocurrency and digital assets.      In the early days of blockchain explorations, evangelists for the tech questioned the need for infrastructure such as central securities depositories (CSDs) as a decentralized future came into focus.      Nivaura has since taken the view that it’s not about replacing things like CSDs, but rather about how to automate securitization work flows, with the option to plug into any clearing system – that could be Clearstream or Ethereum.    Read more: Who Needs a CSD? Nivaura to Issue First Regulated Ether Bond    “The problem that we’re solving for is not blockchain, it’s a transaction orchestration problem,” Nivaura founder Avtar Sehra said in an interview, adding:    “You could have a Santander platform interacting with JPMorgan or Citibank or DBS, etc. How do we make sure all the parties can communicate and take the workflow to the next level and create a tokenized asset?”    Traditional marketplaces, where everybody is on the same platform, communicating and executing, means all participants are tied to a central counperparty's processes and rules, said Sehra.    Read more: Santander Settles Both Sides of a $20 Million Bond Trade on Ethereum    Another approach is where every bank or dealer connects via APIs to everyone else, but this can be inefficient and costly. Nivaura’s third way is a hybrid of a hub-and-spoke and an API approach.      “You do a single API connection into a decentralized network like Ethereum, a public network. In that single API connection, you can share a smart contract with anyone, essentially like DeFi,” said Sehra.    Beyond Ethereum    While Ethereum has been the home of much of Nivaura’s work thus far, Sehra said other blockchains have piqued his interest, such as Polkadot and Diem (formerly Libra).    Nivaura has worked with a group of global law firms to create the General Legal Mark-Up Language (GLML)https://www.nivaura.com/skydeck/glml/ so lawyers with zero software programming experience can set up documents for digitization and automation.    In addition to its work with DBS, the London-based fintech firm is launching the open source GLML Foundation to mature the template for automating tokenized securities.      “The time is ripe for traditional ways of bond origination to make way for a more digital approach, to do what has been aspired for so long – by taking the first step towards the creation of an independent platform that allows bond issuers efficient and effective direct access to the market place and bond investors,"" DBS Global Head of Fixed Income Clifford Lee said in a statement.

BTCChina, which was founded by Huang Xiaoyu and Yang Linke in 2011, said Thursday it had completely exited from business relating to bitcoin, the South China Morning Post reported.      The company's stake in Singapore-registered bitcoin exchange ZG.com was sold to a foundation in Dubai a little over a year ago, the report revealed.      In 2018, the exchange side of BTCC was acquired by an unidentified Hong Kong-based blockchain investment fund, but continued to operate as normal for investors outside of China's great firewall.
