42394174,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY2ff,1666648797,On-Chain Analysis: How to Effectively Manage DeFi Risks,"Even though decentralized finance (DeFi) is on the right track in terms of growth and adoption, the space is still full of risks, uncertainty and volatility. One of its biggest advantages over centralized finance is the availability and accessibility of financial data. Since transactions are public, blockchain provides a unique opportunity for understanding market sentiment through data analysis.  This innovative prospect is known as on-chain analysis. In simple terms, it is the practice of analyzing the fundamentals, utility and transaction activity of a cryptocurrency and corresponding blockchains in order to predict future price movement and a wider range of market metrics.  Iakov Levin is the founder and CEO of Midas.Investments, a custodial CeDeFi (centralized decentralized finance) crypto-investment platform.  On-chain analysis provides a view of the digital finance system for better decision-making and helps answer critical questions: Who's holding the majority of assets? Are holders of a specific token sitting on profits?  Why do we need an on-chain analysis?  Any form of investment requires an extensive analysis of market sentiment and capital positions. There is always a challenge in traditional business analytics because market data is not always transparent.  On the other hand, the transparent nature of DeFi means there is a lot of accessible data. However, for such data to be actionable it needs to be refined, organized and transformed into comprehensible information.  See also: Anyone Can Start a Hedge Fund: How On-Chain Credit Changes the Crypto Economy | Opinion  The on-chain analysis approach bridges this gap. It creates an effective practice to measure necessary data and metrics and potentially simplify complex investment decisions.  Moreover, it can be a powerful practice in identifying protocols with high liquidity and security risks. We are only in the early stages of on-chain analysis. However, the emergence of more innovative data brokers and analytics solutions could see next-gen chain analysis bring more comprehensive visibility to the entire DeFi industry.  The negative side of on-chain analytics  It’s important to remember that we shouldn’t rely on on-chain analytics alone. More often than not, it doesn’t provide the entire picture of market transactions where we see the skeleton data of transactions without understanding their context. There’s a risk that one may not see the bigger picture regarding what's driving the current market sentiment – and how long it might be sustained.  The crypto and DeFi spaces are highly strategic. Recently, we've seen tweets or announcements from influential public figures significantly pump specific tokens beyond their projected value, and small changes in regulations completely decimate a token's floor price. These prospects are relatively frequent in the DeFi space, which can't be predicted through on-chain analytics.  Focusing too granularly on micro details can cause the broader strategic narrative to be lost. While such analytics effectively provide critical insights into each transaction, they can't provide a broader context by linking each activity across the blockchain.  Still, such pitfalls of on-chain analytics might be addressed in the future when we see more and more wallets being labeled across the exchanges, making it possible to make investment decisions in a much more balanced and efficient way.  How to use on-chain analysis effectively  The most critical on-chain metrics that investors tend to rely on are liquidity indicators and their changes over time. On-chain analytics looks to provide insights into how liquidity spills from one protocol to another over time. For example, if a network is experiencing high liquidity, it can be predicted that some associated protocols and tokens will lose value.  See also: How DeFi Can Deliver Value for Artists and Musicians | Opinion  There are several different analytics tools that are tailored for different levels of investors. The most basic one is Nansen, which allows users to dig deep into what's happening inside wallet addresses across the blockchain. Nansen helps to identify token flows between major players, where money is being moved and deposited, which non-fungible tokens (NFT) are positioned for higher prices, and more.  Then there's Dune Dashboard, where users (usually advanced traders) can write SQL queries to identify and track required metrics and convert them into comprehensive visual charts. There are also other popular tools tailored to specific blockchains, such as Etherscan, Santiment and Messari.  The intense demand for on-chain analysis, and its future  On-chain analysis has become a powerful tool over the last few years, especially for investment firms and venture capital funds. Many have built their own advanced chain analytics systems to identify more in-depth metrics and efficiently manage their clients’ risk positions. Several startups have also entered the blockchain data analytics market, working as data brokers and supplying actionable blockchain analytics data to top venture capitalists (VC) and investors.  The future of on-chain analysis looks promising. This intense demand for on-chain analytics will continue to grow because Web3 services are projected to increase by 700% in the next five years. As more VCs and hedge funds use these analytics for making sustainable decisions and more data brokers enter this space, the current challenges of on-chain analytics will be addressed through innovation.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Iakov Levin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/24/on-chain-analysis-how-to-effectively-manage-defi-risks,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42415174,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBYc8W,1666647110,Apple Refuses to Exempt NFTs From App Store’s 30% Fee,"Apple has rejected calls to exempt NFTs from its 30% “Apple Tax” on in-app purchases.  The tech giant codified its rules for iOS apps that handle non-fungible tokens on Monday with its first formal green light on offering in-app NFT minting, buying and selling – activities that it had never technically banned.  But the iPhone-maker’s de facto ban on NFT trading in apps is likely to remain. That’s because in-app NFT transactions must use Apple’s rails for in-app commerce, where Apple demands a 30% cut. Creators and marketplaces have long balked at the fees, choosing to limit in-app NFT functionality rather than lose a massive slice of revenue.  Just last month, The Information reported on how Apple’s fee policies are keeping marketplaces and creators away from its ecosystem and sometimes leading them to abandon NFT integrations outright.  Because Apple’s “in-app purchase” service does not handle crypto payments, it would appear unlikely that apps that choose to offer NFT mints could accept crypto in return.  The Monday updates mark the first time Apple has provided specific rules for NFTs in its App Store guidelines.  The policy update also bans apps from offering exclusive access to NFT owners, or from linking their users to third-party sites where they might buy, sell and mint outside the Apple ecosystem – thus evading the fee derisively known as the “Apple Tax.”  “Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency wallets, etc.,” reads section 3.1.1. of its App Store rules on Oct. 24 (the crypto mentions do not appear in an Oct. 22 version).  The updated wording does not fundamentally change Apple’s existing policies permitting in-app crypto trading on services such as Coinbase and FTX, which don’t have to pay 30% fees.  But it does add some more explicit teeth (emphasis added in bold):  Revised 3.1.5(iii): “Exchanges: Apps may facilitate transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange, provided they are offered only in countries or regions where the app has appropriate licensing and permissions to provide a cryptocurrency exchange.”  Read more: Apple Is Stifling the Metaverse, Tech Expert Says",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/24/apple-refuses-to-exempt-nfts-from-app-stores-30-fee,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/333d5fe59558e09bdd012eaea7df8c70e8a150ef-2133x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42415183,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBYcza,1666647096,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Holds Its Perch Over $19K and Is Likely to Continue Trading in Its Current Narrow Range,"Price Action  Bitcoin (BTC) spent another day comfortably perched above $19,000 and well within the narrow range it has held for more than a month.  Uber-investor Peter Brandt told CoinDesk TV that investors should not expect much to change for the foreseeable future and that the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization might drop as low as $13,000. Investors are “just tired,” Brandt said in a 10-minute interview.  BTC was recently changing hands at about $19,300, flat over the past 24 hours. Ether was recently trading near $1,350, up by less than a percentage point from Sunday, same time. Other major cryptos were also up or down in small increments, albeit slightly more to the red. Among the exceptions was MATIC, which recently rose more than 6%.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was down 0.9% over the past 24 hours.  Investors in crypto and other markets for risk assets continue to eye U.S. Federal Reserve efforts to tame inflation. In an interview with CoinDesk, GSR Markets Global Head of Product Benoit Bosc said that any lessening of the current dose of steep interest rate hikes would spur a “knee-jerk reaction.”  “It will be a sharp move higher for risk assets,” he said.  Macro View  In traditional markets, U.S. stocks were buoyant for a second trading consecutive day amid faint signs that the U.S. central bank might ratchet back its current hawkish, monetary policies early next year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed up 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was up almost a percentage point.  In commodities, Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, ticked up slightly to trade over $91 per barrel, down slightly from last week but still up more than 15% from the start of the year. Safe-haven gold sank 0.6% to trade at $1,650 per ounce.  The earnings season continues with Apple and Google parent Alphabet among the major tech companies scheduled to report. A number of major brands last week, including Goldman Sachs, offered a few nuggets of good news.  The U.S. Federal Reserve's next rate hike – a widely expected 75 basis points – is still two weeks away.

Technical Take  Bitcoin Continues to Ride Area of Support; Volatility Still Low  By Glenn Williams Jr  Veteran trader Peter Brandt told CoinDesk TV on Friday that bitcoin is likely to remain in a tight range for a while, and could even plunge to $13,000 support, or its lowest trading point, before rallying to new highs.  Finding a counter-argument to Brandt’s analysis is difficult. Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range, and a catalyst to send the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization higher has yet to emerge. Volatility has dissipated substantially.  Bitcoin’s Average True Range (ATR), a measurement of overall price volatility, has declined 76% year to date, and sits at levels last seen in November 2020.

She said she hasn't sold any of that initial investment, meaning her current profit on that $100,000 bet would be around $7.6 million.  Wood, whose firm she co-founded is focused on innovative and disruptive investments, said that while she was able to make that personal bet on bitcoin, she couldn't do the same in the ARK funds themselves as they were and are only allowed to invest in securities.  ARK eventually was able to get bitcoin exposure via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The ARK Next Generation Internet Fund (ARKW) currently holds about 5.9 million shares of GBTC valued at roughly $67.4 million.  Wood continues to be bullish on bitcoin, and sees the Grayscale Trust – currently selling at about a 35% discount to net asset value – as trading at a ""fire sale"" price given the chance that at some point it will be cleared to convert into a spot exchange-traded fund (if regulators allow).  Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.

Finding a counter-argument to Brandt’s analysis is difficult. Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range, and a catalyst to send the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization higher has yet to emerge. Volatility for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap has dissipated substantially.  Bitcoin’s Average True Range (ATR), a measurement of overall price volatility, has declined 76% year to date, and sits at levels last seen in November 2020.  The price of BTC have declined 60% over the identical time frame, highlighting the slow, tedious grind lower for BTC.  BTC has exhibited far less volatility than the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq Composite, whose ATRs by comparison have increased 64% and 19% year to date, respectively.  BTC momentum remains decidedly neutral as its RSI (Relative Strength Index) sits at 48.  BTC also appears to be trading right along an area of support, which will vary depending on your method of calculation.  Visually, BTC support appears to have formed around $18,900. Looking at price points, and taking volume at those prices into account implies a slightly higher support level at around $19,300.  Brandt identified support levels close to $18,000, but would not be surprised if BTC traded past $17,000 to as low as $13,000 in a “final panic.”  A 32% decline from current prices, would likely stem from a significant negative catalyst. Still, investors would be prudent to consider all options, particularly as we’ve declined by twice that in 10 months.  A look at BTC options open interest by strike price also implies support at $18,000 given the accumulation of call options at the $18,000 strike price. A similar level of call options exists at the $18,500 strike price, while the number of put options begins to exceed calls at $18,750.

Speaking at a panel discussion hosted by law firm Lowenstein Sandler in New York on Monday, Behnam said he gets “very irritated when folks start to talk about the CFTC as a more favorable regulator,” adding that his agency’s “greatest accomplishment” was its track record of crypto-related enforcement actions.  Many in the crypto industry have long perceived the CFTC as more crypto-friendly – or, at least, more open to innovation – than its sister agency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has often been accused of regulating via enforcement under the leadership of Chairman Gary Gensler. However, that perception has recently begun to wane as the CFTC has ramped up its crypto-related enforcement actions.  Some of those enforcement actions, particularly the CFTC’s recent lawsuit against anonymous members of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) have earned the CFTC the same criticism often lobbed at the SEC – that it is overstepping the law to regulate the nascent crypto industry through enforcement.  Though Behnam said his agency was not attempting to “play fast and loose” when it comes to enforcing commodities laws against crypto companies, he remains willing to be “very creative” in how the CFTC applies existing laws to encourage crypto exchanges to come into the regulatory fold.  Read more: CFTC’s Ooki DAO Action Shatters Illusion of a Regulator-Proof Protocol  Under Behnam’s leadership, the CFTC has increasingly cracked down on crypto crime. More than 20% of all the agency’s enforcement actions in fiscal year 2022 were brought against crypto entities.  Behnam stressed on Monday that all of those actions – as well as all of the 60-odd crypto-related enforcement actions brought by the CFTC dating back to 2014 – have been the result of anonymous tips and whistleblowers. Behnam claims that his agency does not currently have the resources to do its own data analytics and investigations, and is currently only regulating “through a pinhole.”  Two bills currently being considered by Congress seek to widen the CFTC’s authority (and boost its financial ability) to regulate the crypto spot market. Behnam, who has publicly supported both bills, said Monday that additional jurisdiction and resources would allow the agency to root out fraud and manipulation in the market.  “If we had more funds, if we had more personnel, we could bring more of this fraud and manipulation to light,” Behnam said.",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/24/cftc-chair-behnam-says-number-one-accomplishment-is-track-record-of-enforcement-actions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae8ecc1176bd5e5cd93b0cc7afd71fb811d9dc4e-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a press release and an unsealed deposition, Guochun He and Zheng Wang tried to collect information about an ongoing legal effort against the company, which appears to be Huawei Technologies, a multinational tech company headquartered in Shenzhen, China. Prosecutors are alleging the pair tried to obstruct the investigation, including by attempting to bribe a U.S. law enforcement official with $61,000 worth of bitcoin.  U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland tied the announcement to two other actions taken by prosecutors in New York and New Jersey, who announced charges against a number of individuals working for the Chinese government on various surveillance and harassment allegations.  A deposition, signed by FBI Supervisory Special Agent Thomas Ryder, mentions the bitcoin aspect of the case numerous times, saying He called it a ""safe"" method of paying the law enforcement official, referred to in the document as GE-1.  ""With respect to converting the bitcoin payment to cash, He wrote: 'I suggest you do it in gambling house, I know in some house of Las Vegas can make it, it will be private and safe. Please waiting for my further information,'"" according to the deposition.  The defendants paid GE-1 in two different tranches, one for $20,000 and the other for $41,000, according to the deposition. One of the transactions was for a document that was supposed to help Huawei's case and was classified, though the U.S. official did not actually share any classified material, the filing said.  Still, while the amount used was not a lot, U.S. officials Monday said the action was part of a broader picture about the Chinese government and its purported effort to undermine international laws and individuals' rights.  ""The Justice Department will not tolerate attempts by any foreign power to undermine the rule of law upon which our democracy is based. We will continue to fiercely protect the rights guaranteed to everyone in our country, and we will defend the integrity of our institutions,"" Garland said during a press conference.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/24/chinese-intelligence-officers-used-bitcoin-in-scheme-to-undermine-investigation-us-officials-allege,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e15f32ddcb6ce29a19a243ed478f94aa330f7c3d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What’s more, Qadir told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover,” the market for royalties may be dwindling.  “Because they’re driven by market volume and velocity of the NFT space in general, not many people are making tons of money from royalties,” Qadir said. Royalties, which are considered to be “social norms enforced by marketplaces,” Qadir said, are used as a way for creators to earn money on their work.  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  According to Galaxy Digital’s most recent report, NFT creators have earned upwards of $1.8 billion in royalties from secondary sales. That number however may be skewed; 80% of that amount was made by 482 creators. As well, the value is calculated at the time of transaction and does not gauge whether creators cashed out or held on to their earnings.  The marketplace itself is also changing.  The challenge for royalty-based platforms may be the emergence of zero royalty marketplaces, such as Yawww and Hadeswap. Magic Eden, which has 90% of the NFT market share on Solana, made the royalty-based requirement optional after feeling some heat from zero-royalty competitors, suggesting a significant shift.  Read more: NFTs Can and Will Be So Much More  What platform is used by creators can dictate the kinds of marketplaces that can thrive. OpenSea, which does have royalties, still has about 80% of NFT marketplace volume on Ethereum.  “On Solana, NFTs tend to be worth less money and tend to attract a mercenary type of trader that wants to flip,” Qadir said. “Ethereum, on the other hand, is home to most of the valuable NFTs in [the] space.”  Qadir said that whether royalties will be around in the next five to 10 years is a “heated debate” that will depend on whether they are seen as a “key value proposition” for online marketplaces.

42413288,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8Hyi,1666638732,Azuki Raises $2.5M With NFT-Backed Golden Skateboard Sale,"Popular non-fungible token (NFT) project Azuki garnered attention this weekend with the auction of eight golden skateboard NFTs, which raised $2.5 million in sales volume.  Holders can burn the NFTs to redeem a real-life, gold-plated skateboard. The sale is linked to the debut of what Azuki is calling its “physically backed tokens,” or PBTs. Chiru Labs, the creative collective behind the project, said the skateboard weighs 45 pounds and is not recommended for riding.  Ownership of the physical skateboards can be transferred digitally and is separate from the original NFT, a new take on the burgeoning “phygital” (physical + digital) collectibles market. Chiru Labs says it does so with a “cryptographic BEAN chip” implanted in each board, which can be scanned by holders similar to an NFC chip.  The Azuki stewards told CoinDesk the auction had 145 bids in total, with the lowest winning bid being 200 ETH (approx. $267,000) placed by darklady.eth and the highest winning bid being 309 ETH (approx. $413,000) set by dingaling.eth, a prominent NFT collector who owns 102 Azuki NFTs.  For high-rolling JPEG collectors, the NFTs mean more than just their redeemable skateboards. The project says winning bidders will become “an unforgettable part of the Azuki story,” enshrined in the collection’s lore through unique emblems attached to the NFTs displayed on the project’s website.  It’s not the first project to meld high-value physical collectibles with degen collectibility. In August, jewelry maker Tiffany and Co. released a collection of NFTs for CryptoPunk owners that could be redeemed for diamond necklaces, raising $12 million in sales.  Azuki is the fifth-most popular NFT collection of all time by sales volume, with 266,000 ETH (approx. $355 million) in sales since its launch in January. The collection is currently holding onto a floor price of 11.5 ETH, down from its high of 29 ETH in May, according to data from NFT Floor Price.  Whether holders of the NFTs choose to redeem their tokens for the skateboard or hold for resale value is yet to be seen. At the time of publishing, the highest active bid on one of the eight NFTs is just 6 ETH ($8,000), according to OpenSea.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/24/azuki-raises-25m-with-nft-backed-golden-skateboard-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/704200f0b741e0acbeb1c41304ba25bc9eb477a6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415335,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBdBvM,1666638456,Struggling Bitcoin Miners Are Flocking to Maple Finance’s $300M Lending Pool,"Bitcoin miners are queuing up to borrow from a special purpose decentralized finance (DeFi) lending pool created by Maple Finance, as a stressed out crypto industry explores creative ways to get through the bear market.  Since Maple and credit agent Icebreaker launched the miner finance pool a month back, a pipeline of about six to 10 mining companies is in place to form the first cohort of borrowers, with another 25 on the waiting list, according to Maple Finance CEO Sidney Powell.  Mining companies, many of which are already burdened with debt, are feeling the chill of the crypto winter as the price of bitcoin languishes around the $20,000 mark and the cost of electricity rockets. Most recently, Compute North, one of the largest data centers that host mining computers, filed for bankruptcy, citing market conditions as one of the reasons.  With crypto asset prices down and bitcoin falling more than 50% this year, capital from usual sources has completely dried up. Given the capital-intensive business model of the crypto mining business, miners are looking for alternatives, and private credit seems to be offering new and creative ways to help firms that are under stress, said Powell.  Read more: Wall Street Analyst ‘Pulling the Plug’ on Bitcoin Miners Owing to Bear Market Woes  There are strings attached, of course. Interest rates are going to be around 18%-20% and the loans are being offered on a “full recourse” basis, which will require a guarantee over all the assets of a miner – not just mining rigs, but also property and power equipment – should they default or seek bankruptcy protection. A lack of full recourse loans has meant some lenders to the mining sector have got into difficulty, Powell added.  “The sector needs liquidity, so we are figuring out creative ways to assist,” Powell said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Typically, the firms you would want to underwrite are those with low levels of debt on their balance sheet, and who have things like power purchase agreements in place, so effectively a longer line of sight on what their electricity will cost.”  A $300 million target  Powell said Maple has received the first $10 million-$12 million of commitments so far and he expects the pool to reach its $300 million cap by around the middle of next year. Borrowers include a mix of large publicly traded firms and some smaller private ones with locked-in power agreements and have innovative ways of cooling the mining rigs.  Previously, a common loan structure for mining firms was either bitcoin-backed loans or non-recourse loans against ASICs – the specialist mining equipment used to earn bitcoin. Under these terms, when a loan is not performing, the borrower can hand back the ASICs to the financier and walk away from the loan.  “[That’s what we don't want to happen [with Maple's lending pool]. Mining equipment is subject to wear and tear and the value of ASIC can fluctuate even more than bitcoin. To avoid this, Icebreaker's loans will be full-recourse,” Powell said.  Maple isn’t the only company looking to capitalize on opportunities for lending to struggling crypto miners. Most recently, Binance Pool announced its own $500 million lending fund for bitcoin miners. Meanwhile, crypto billionaire Jihan Wu – the founder of bitcoin mining rig maker Bitmain – was reported to be setting up a $250 million fund to purchase distressed assets from mining firms.

While the country should not be quick to dismiss the metaverse, a superset of virtual, augmented and physical reality, it should hasten to try and regulate it, the researchers said in a report published Monday.  The report, spread out over 116 pages and split into two parts, is the result of an exploratory mission into the metaverse, set in February 2022 by members of the French government, including the ministers for finance and culture. The document outlines opportunities and challenges the metaverse presents and how France should approach the advent of virtual worlds.  “Don't throw the metaverse baby out with the Facebook bathwater!” the researchers write in the report, pointing out that the conceptualization of virtual worlds predates Meta, the tech giant and aspiring metaverse builder formerly known as Facebook.  They warn that Silicon Valley’s “battle of perspectives” about whether the metaverse should, for instance, remain open to the general public or be limited to private groups, is indicative of what could happen should virtual worlds be rooted in “technologies plagued by isolating users from each other, and from the world around them.”  France defends an “open, free and secure internet” and this stance must also be reflected in the “diplomatic bodies and negotiation techniques on the future of communication technologies,” the researchers say.  The mission was led by Camille François, a researcher at Columbia University; Adrien Basdevant, a lawyer of the Paris Bar; and Rémi Ronfard, researcher at France’s National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology.  They called on lawmakers to “start now” on extending frameworks such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) to cover data collection and user protection in the metaverse.  But they also warn against repeating blunders that marked the progression of the EU’s recently agreed-upon regulatory frameworks targeting crypto when setting up rules for the metaverse.  In their report, the researchers singled out the bumpy ride experienced by the draft Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation – which was marked, for instance, by attempts to effectively ban energy-intensive crypto networks like Bitcoin in the bloc – and the overhaul of the Transfer of Funds (TFR) regulation, which sought to identify those who sent money from private digital wallets, as reasons why lawmakers should rely on experts to guide regulations.  “Otherwise the place will quickly be taken by industrial lobbies,” the report said.

The highly regarded technical trader, who has been in the business since the 1970s, predicted it would take 32 months before BTC reaches a new all-time high. Until then, he said, expects the largest cryptocurrency by market value to bottom at $13,000.  Bitcoin’s price has come under pressure from the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish interest rate hikes, meant to curb this year’s hot inflation. Traders and investors across the markets are eyeing the Fed’s next meeting of its monetary-policy committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. Based on the CME’s data of fed funds futures contracts, Wall Street expects a fourth consecutive 75-basis point interest rate hike in November and then possibly smaller hikes thereafter.  Brandt, however, said he didn’t see the interest rate hikes dropping off and expects a 75-basis point increase on Nov. 2 followed by another 75 bps increase on Dec. 14.  “I think that the Fed knows that inflation is a killer,” he said. “The Fed needs to regain its credibility. And to do that, I think the Fed really needs to bring inflation rates back down to at least 4%.” The most recent U.S. annual inflation rate, measured in September, was at 8.2%.  Bitcoin correlated to ... bitcoin  Bitcoin has been seen as a “risk-on” asset, a sign of the market’s appetite for risk. But as traditional market turmoil continues, BTC has seen lower volatility compared to stocks. Meanwhile, BTC”s correlation with gold – which is considered a safe-haven asset during the time of market volatility – reached its highest level in over a year.  Yet, Brandt said he expects bitcoin's value to be “separate from what any other market going to do.”  “Bitcoin is going to be correlated with bitcoin eventually,” he said.  Despite the current narrative that bitcoin’s fate is tied to the market’s desire for risk, Brandt said the cryptocurrency will be the “ultimate store of value” in the next 10 years.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/24/peter-brandt-btc-will-hit-all-time-highs-in-3-years-but-first-13k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e8fb68fa82f276d490558ce6aa8ce0bceb60be0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415342,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBdC7h,1666634528,"MakerDAO Members Support Founder's 'Endgame' Plan to Break Up into MetaDAOs, $2.1B of Transfers","Community members of MakerDAO, the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, voted to move forward with founder Rune Christensen’s bold plan to overhaul how the protocol works and make it more decentralized.  The results, announced Monday, mean that MakerDAO is set to break up into smaller, allegedly more decentralized units called MetaDAOs.  In approving the measures, the community members overruled opposition from a key investor, the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, sometimes known as a16z.  The community members also voted to approve proposals from institutional investors, including the giant crypto exchange Coinbase, over plans for how to allocate some $2 billion of digital assets in the protocol’s treasury. They also approved a plan to accumulate staked ether (stETH) – an ether derivative from the Lido protocol.  MakerDAO is one of the first and largest decentralized lending protocols, often tagged as the central bank of crypto. It also issues the $6 billion stablecoin DAI, whose value is backed by some $8 billion assets in its reserve. The protocol is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where contributors manage the platform and discuss decision-making proposals in a forum, and owners of the platform’s governance token, maker (MKR), vote to approve or reject each proposal.  The latest set of polls were all part of MakerDAO’s attempt to make the platform more decentralized and resistant to censorship, while putting its vast reserves into work by lending a billion dollars in assets to institutional investors and earning yield.  The proposals stemmed from Christensen’s ambitious road map called the “Endgame plan,” which aimed to improve the protocol’s decision-making and diversify DAI’s backing from assets that might be sanctioned or banned by governments. MakerDAO received criticism for relying too much on Circle’s centralized stablecoin USDC in its reserves after the U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted crypto mixer Tornado Cash in August.  MakerDAO founder tightens grip  Monday’s election results mean MakerDAO is set to break up its current structure based on Strategic Core Units and create independent management clusters called MetaDAOs.  The plan includes spinning off the Real-World Financial Core Unit, an important MakerDAO unit that oversees lending and works on incorporating real-world assets such as bonds and government treasuries in Maker’s reserves, into a MetaDAO, separating it from the protocol’s decision-making DAO.  Andreesen Horowitz (a16z), an investor in Maker and a significant owner of MKR, was against the overhaul and for making the current structure more efficient, CoinDesk reported last week.  Still, the overwhelming majority, some 80% of voters, supported the proposal. Drama between the different factions in the protocol’s governance at least since this summer, when investors and founders came face to face in a vote about the protocol’s lending oversight unit.  The results imply that Maker voters rallied behind the founder’s vision to achieve decentralization.  “Some might say it reaffirms tight control of Rune over MakerDAO,” said Sebastien Derivaux, a crypto banking expert and MakerDAO contributor.  Moving funds to Coinbase, accumulate stETH  Voters also ratified to move $1.6 billion in USDC stablecoin to Coinbase Prime, the crypto exchange’s institutional investment arm, from Maker’s reserves. The transfer enables Maker to earn a 1.5% yield on its assets.  Owen Lau, market research firm Oppenheimer’s analyst, said that Coinbase would benefit from the transfer. However, it does little to improve diversification from USDC and make the platform more resistant to potential censorship, David Shuttleworth, DeFi analyst at ConsenSys, told CoinDesk.  Another approved proposal green-lights the transfer of another $500 million in USDC to a consortium of hedge fund Appaloosa and crypto broker Monetalis, which would lend it to Coinbase. The loan would be collateralized by bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) with an expected annual return of between 4.5% and 6%.  Voters also supported the creation of a vault for ether derivative stETH in DAI’s reserve.  The approved proposal enables Maker to accumulate more stETH and diversify DAI’s backing assets from USDC.  Currently, Maker holds $8.6 billion in assets in its reserves that ensures DAI’s peg to the U.S. dollar. More than half of it is in USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle.  Earlier, Maker decided to invest $500 million from its reserves into corporate bonds and government treasuries to move away from USDC and make its balance sheet more efficient.",POSITIVE,MKR | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MKR | USDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/24/makerdao-members-support-founders-endgame-plan-to-break-up-into-metadaos-21b-of-transfers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4405bf660ff0d271bf3d0cea9d3f7ece6b421571-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its native cryptocurrency, AXS, has seen its price take a hit in the market since the bear market began alongside other digital assets in the space. However, it seems that the decline in the price of AXS is not at its end as more tokens are set to be released into circulation on Monday, 24 October. 21.5 Million Tokens Are Coming Just like a lot of other projects in the crypto space, Axie Infinity (AXS) also uses a vesting schedule where tokens are unlocked at specific times. This is in part to control the amount of supply of tokens in the market and to ensure the digital asset remains valuable. The most recent unlock event for Axie Infinity is actually happening on Monday which will see more than 21.5 million tokens being put into circulation.

42420949,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtw4r,1666630389,A Day in the Life of a Crypto Trader,"Charts, charts and more charts. Then more charts. If it’s a day that ends in a Y, a crypto trader is looking at charts. “I have to be on top of things at all times,” says Adrian Zdunczyk, a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) and founder of the trading group The Birb Nest. “At no point can I say, I don’t give a [damn] about the market for the next week.”  If you’re a trader of U.S. stocks, then you can focus on the first hour of trading – which has the most volatility (and the most trading opportunities) – and then shut down for the day. And when the market closes at 4 p.m., you’re forced to stop trading and go have a life.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Trading Week.""  Not the case with crypto. It’s 24/7 and it’s blinking and flashing and tempting you with juicy alpha. Does this mean that successful crypto traders spend all of their time trading?  It’s almost the opposite. “Most successful traders don’t scalp all day long,” says Christopher Inks, founder of the trading group TexasWest Capital. “For most of them it’s a few hours out of their day.”  This doesn’t mean the charts can be ignored – it just means you need structure. “It’s about finding the right balance,” says Zdunczyk. “It cannot become an around-the-clock addiction.”  Read More: 15 Ways to Stay Sane While Trading Crypto  This 24/7 addiction is what Zdunczyk often sees with the “average crypto trader.” He then describes this average trader: Someone who’s “probably a little depressed,” often middle-aged, often male, and they “f**king hate their day job.” They trade on their emotions, they lack knowledge and “they will lose 90% of the time.” They stare at charts with red eyes until 2 a.m. They impulsively trade with leverage. “They imagine that high-frequency trading is going to be the answer to their problems,” says Zdunczyk. “But the more they do it, the more they blow up their account. This is the completely average trader.”  So instead of focusing on this “average” (and miserable) crypto trader, we’ll look at a day in the life of two successful ones – Zduńczyk and Inks.  Read More: 9 Survival Tips for Crypto Winter  This is how they trade crypto and maintain their sanity.  6:30 a.m. – Adrian Zdunczyk wakes up. He takes his dog for a 20-minute half-walk, half-run. A practicing Catholic, Zdunczyk listens to the Gospel on his AirPods because “it opens my mind and sets me right for the day.” So does he wait until after this healthy routine to check the charts? Well, the man’s only human. “The first time I check is when I open my eyes,” says Zdunczyk with a laugh. “When I go to the toilet, I’m taking a pee and looking at my phone and scrolling through the crypto charts.”  7 a.m. – Christopher Inks wakes up. “I’ll admit, I pull up my charts real quick before I get out of bed,” he says. In his Texas home office he’ll then romp through charts across many markets – crypto, U.S. equities, forex. If the action is quiet in one asset class he’ll move to another. He’s actively looking for opportunities. “I’m always looking to enter,” says Inks. “Any time I look at the chart it’s always with the intent of finding the trade.”  8 a.m. – Zdunczyk analyzes chart after chart, although unlike Inks, he’s not necessarily looking to pounce on trades. There are many different styles and strategies of trading – one is not necessarily better than the other. Zdunczyk is a swing trader (meaning he’ll hold for days or weeks or longer), and says that “most of my portfolio would not change for three months.”  8:30 a.m. – Inks is still crushing charts. He’ll always start with the larger time frame – daily or weekly – before zooming in to the intra-day. “A lot of new traders don’t look at the larger time frames,” he says, which leads to over-trading (and getting chopped up) on the 1-minute or 5-minute charts.  9 a.m. – Zdunczyk uses the pomodoro method to stay focused, meaning 25-minute bursts of focused productivity followed by a short break to do whatever he wants. (I’ve been using this method for years; it works.) During the blocks of focus time, he works on developing his business (such as working on new partnerships), and in the short breaks he’ll check Crypto Twitter and scan the charts. He can’t let that slide. “You can lose your money in the blink of an eye,” says Zdunczyk. “You have to react immediately. You have to be fed information all the time.”  12 p.m. – Inks tries to step away from the charts for lunch. “I talk to traders all day long, and I know a lot of them tend to pull out their phones if they’re out on a date or out with family,” he says. “I try really hard to get them not to do that.” Not only is this bad for mental health, it’s also bad for trading. Inks says that when you never peel away from the charts, you’ll become overly stressed and you will “make decisions that you normally wouldn’t make.” Bonus reason to take breaks: Staring at crypto charts, as a general rule, is not the best strategy to get a second date.  Read More: 9 Survival Tips for Crypto Winter  12 p.m. – Zdunczyk is an intermittent faster, meaning he can’t eat his first meal until around 11 a.m. or 12 p.m. “I don’t have much time to cook,” he says, so he orders in healthy lunchboxes that contain specific nutritional and caloric content. He checks Twitter and Discord. “I’m seeing what’s trending and what’s not trending, what’s quiet and what’s loud.” After lunch, in the natural post-meal lull, Zduńczyk knocks out tasks that require less focus – catching up on email and administrative work.  1 p.m. – Inks dives back into the charts, often preparing analysis that he’ll share on Twitter or a class for Texas West Capital. He uses scanning software to find possible trades.  3 p.m. – Zdunczyk takes his dog for a longer walk. He’s also listening to podcasts and longform interviews, “feeding my brain with information.” Or sometimes he’ll go on a walk with his wife, and around then he eats his second meal of the day.  3 p.m. – Inks holds a live class for his trading group, answers questions and walks through his perspective on the charts.  4 p.m. – Zdunczyk begins his second wave of highly productive work, focusing on tasks that demand peak mental engagement – recalibrating his company’s sales strategy, for example.  4 p.m. – Inks interacts with his trading group on Discord, where he’ll usually find an ocean of DMs. “A lot of my day is speaking to subscribers to our service and helping them out,” he says. “I fit in all the business stuff where I can.”  4:30 p.m. – Zdunczyk continues to focus on the “business work” whole, stealing peeks at the charts and Twitter. It can be tricky to get the balance right. If you ignore Twitter you might miss something big; if you’re too Twitter-happy, you lose focus on the real work.  5 p.m. – More charting for Inks. Much of this is for the benefit of his trading group subscribers, as opposed to his own personal trading. This is not uncommon for successful traders. While the exact specifics of other successful crypto traders will vary, they’ll often share this one thing in common:  The actual trading only takes a few hours, and the rest of the day is packed with running their business or writing their newsletter or engaging with their community. Traders aren’t always trading.  6 p.m. – Zdunczyk hosts a livestream where he analyzes the charts, answers questions and explains the logic of his technical analysis.  7 p.m. – Inks breaks for dinner, spends time with family.  8 p.m. – Zduńczyk has calls and meetings, conducts interviews, talks with friends on Twitter.  8 p.m. – Inks returns to the charts … and he’ll stick with them for hours. He’ll often work until 11 p.m., midnight or even 1 a.m. to study the charts and share his thoughts with the community. “At the end of the day, I tend to be a bit of a workaholic,” he says. “I have to watch that, because I do have a young son.”  10 p.m. – “I slowly detach myself,” says Zdunczyk, and spends time with his wife. He does his best to avoid the siren song of the charts but sometimes he succumbs, even when he knows he shouldn’t, even after all these years of experience, even when he knows it’s healthy. Because ultimately, Zdunczyk says, “every trader is a child at heart.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/24/cryptocurrency-trading-day-in-the-life,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/44b8571f3b753cb1d8d799ae73c7c859719fade7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411723,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfJPZ,1666628611,What Is Margin Trading? A Risky Crypto Trading Strategy Explained,"Say you buy $100 worth of bitcoin thinking the price will go up 20%. If it does, and you cash out, you’ll end up with a profit of $20.  But what if you could buy $1,000 worth of bitcoin with only $100 of your funds – that’s to say, trade with leverage? If you did, you’d end up with $200 – essentially doubling your money.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  And what if you could use that $100 to bet on the price of bitcoin going down and profit by becoming a short seller?  Well, you can. It’s called margin trading, a risky crypto strategy that lets you magnify gains and losses with borrowed funds often referred to as “leverage.”  In crypto, futures and perpetual swap markets are more popular with margin traders. Most major crypto exchanges, such as Binance, offer margin trading options. They vary by fees and leverage ratios on offer.  But caveat emptor: Crypto’s a highly volatile market, and margin trading adds extra risk, such as getting liquidated (losing your funds when you can’t pay the debt) after small market movements in the opposite direction of your bet. This is known as a “margin call” – when the traders are asked to put up more capital to guarantee their end of the trade. (There was a really good feature film about margin calls following the financial crisis of 2008. Spoiler alert: The bankers manage to save themselves while wiping out everyone else in the market.)  What is margin trading?  Margin trading, also called leveraged trading, refers to making bets on crypto markets with “leverage,” or borrowed funds, while only exposing a smaller amount of your own capital. Margin is the amount of crypto you need to enter into a leveraged position.  Margin trading positions can be opened as either:  A short position: where you bet on the price going down  A long position: where you bet on the price going up  In a long position, you buy a cryptocurrency in anticipation of selling it in the future when the price rises, making a profit from the price difference. This is also possible without margin. In a short position, you borrow a cryptocurrency at its current price to repurchase it when the price drops to make a profit.  Leverage is expressed in ratios, such as 20:1 or 100:1. So, if your trading account has $2,000 and you want to open a long position with a 100:1 leverage ratio, that means you’ll need to stump up collateral – using your own funds – equal to 1% of your position size. The crypto exchange will provide the remaining 99%.  Why trade on margin?  If you can just hold bitcoin and benefit from its price rises, why trade on margin? There are at least three reasons.  To magnify gains: Trading on margin allows you to increase your profit potential if the market moves in your favor.  Hedging: If you hold a lot of BTC and want to reduce your exposure to the risk of bitcoin’s price going down, you may hedge (manage your risks) by opening a short position.  Short selling: Having a margin account allows you to short assets, which you can’t do with spot trading.  But the benefits have their own risks.  While you may magnify your gains by trading on margin, you may also risk losing significantly if proper risk management is not in place.  And although margin trading may help you manage risk by letting you hedge, margin interests and other transaction costs may eat into your profits.  Cross margin or isolated margin  Most exchanges will offer two types of margin: cross and isolated.  If you trade with isolated margin, you will need to assign individual margins (your funds to put up as collateral) to different trading pairs, such as BTC/USDT or ETH/USDC. The benefit is you isolate the risk to specific trading pairs, while the downside is it limits your margin level.  Cross margin lets you share the same margin (again, your collateral) in all open positions. The advantage is that it reduces your risk of liquidation in individual positions, but you may also risk getting your whole account wiped out to save one position.  Liquidation and margin call  The amount of funds the exchange requires you to hold in the margin account is called the margin level. The exchange will indicate your margin level and how “healthy” it currently is; that is, how far you are from liquidation (losing your funds when you can’t pay the debt).  And when the margin level becomes unhealthy, you risk liquidation: the forced sale of your collateral (the funds you provided for margin) to cover the loss. In crypto, this usually happens automatically (“forced liquidation”).  Before the risk becomes a reality, however, the trader will receive a “margin call” from the crypto exchange. A margin call is a notification that the trader must take action to prevent liquidation. These actions include reducing the position size, posting more collateral or reducing leverage. Forced liquidation often incurs a liquidation fee. This fee varies by exchange.  Liquidations can carry market-wide implications. A series of sizable leveraged positions getting liquidated can cause a domino effect in the markets known as a “liquidation cascade,” pushing the price of a cryptocurrency into free fall due to high volumes of forced selling.  How to manage risks  Although margin trading has its appeal, it’s a risky trade set-up for beginners without a proper risk management strategy to reduce the chances of “getting rekt,” or having their trading entire account wiped out. Here is some advice:  Keep a separate trading account: Allocate just a certain portion to margin trading.  Use a stop-loss: Set a price level at which you want the exchange to exit the position for you, allowing you to cut losses and eliminating the risk of losing it all.  Take profit: Although taking profit at certain price levels reduces your overall earnings, it helps you manage risk better.  Don’t revenge trade.

Dubai-based Bybit bought almost a third of the 16 billion won of convertible debt T-Scientific issued at the end of last month. T-Scientific (057680) is listed on the South Korean stock exchange. Convertible debt is a fixed-income security that pays interest but can be converted into equity under certain conditions.  The transaction gives Bybit a potential stake in one of South Korea's largest crypto exchanges. Bithumb has 24-hour trading volume of $239 million, according to data by CoinGecko, compared with Bybit's $979 million. Bybit said it sees the investment as a means to expand into the Korean blockchain market, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk Monday.  T-Scientific is looking to attract global investors to enhance its financial position and solidify its position in the Korean blockchain and non-fungible token (NFT) market.

42415346,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBdCBo,1666626588,"'Hyperbitcoinization' Is Coming to an Emerging Market Near You, Paxful's Ray Youssef Says","Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin, once famously said, “Bitcoin would be convenient for people who don’t have a credit card.”  According to the World Bank, that’s at least 1.4 billion people. Most of those folks reside in emerging countries like Nigeria and El Salvador. Are these unbanked individuals at the forefront of “hyperbitcoinization” – the point where Bitcoin becomes the world’s dominant monetary system?  Whether “hyperbitcoinization” will become truly global is unclear, but it is a phenomenon that Ray Youssef, CEO and co-founder of Paxful,a peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange that’s popular in Africa, sees taking place in the Global South.  “The amazing thing about Nigeria, from a bitcoin perspective, is that it's probably the only place in the world where the narrative of bitcoin is not speculative. The vast majority of the use cases of bitcoin in Nigeria are peer-to-peer transactions,” Youssef said in an interview with CoinDesk.  According to a report published earlier this year by KuCoin, a global cryptocurrency exchange, more than 33 million Nigerians (roughly 35% of the adult population) own bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. More than half of those individuals use bitcoin and crypto for payments, the report suggests.  The payments use case is supported by another report published last month by blockchain data firm Chainalysis. That report states that sub-Saharan Africa has the world’s highest proportion of small crypto retail payments (80% of crypto payments are under $1,000).  In Kenya, another key market for Paxful, locals use bitcoin at restaurants, spas and retail electronics stores. According to Chainalysis, for Paxful, crypto remittances have soared 140% year over year in the country.  Read more: Crypto Is Quietly Thriving in Sub-Saharan Africa: Chainalysis Report  The role of nation states  Some have suggested that an erosion of trust in a country’s fiat currency is a prerequisite for hyperbitcoinization. If that’s the case, emerging countries plagued with economic mismanagement may end up leading the Bitcoin revolution. Of course, users from such countries would first need exposure to the Bitcoin ecosystem.  In El Salvador, that exposure came, at least in part, when the government officially made bitcoin legal tender in September of last year under President Nayib Bukele.  “Some people accused the president of vanity … and pushing the people into something that didn't make sense,” Youssef said. “I think the rollout could have been a lot smoother. But for a first time effort on a national scale, I think the government and the small young team … did an amazing job.”  Despite making headlines and capturing the hearts of diehard bitcoiners, Bukele’s strategy seems to be an outlier. The only other country to follow El Salvador’s lead has been the Central African Republic, which adopted bitcoin as legal tender this past April. But again, that may be the exception rather than the rule.  “We’ve spoken to a lot of government leaders about this. In all the situations, there's clearly interest. What there is not, is a young president, like a Bukele, that can almost act unilaterally,” Youssef said.  Even when regimes are hostile toward bitcoin and even with infrastructural hurdles such as limited internet connectivity, it seems bitcoin still manages to thrive. Case in point is when Nigeria’s central bank restricted cryptocurrency usage in the country last year (a country where just over half of the population has internet access), Paxful’s volumes increased, according to Youssef.  “They forbade any of their banks from having any accounts [linked to] cryptocurrency exchanges. What happened? Paxful’s volumes went up by 20% at least, and continue to grow, because everyone went peer-to-peer,” Youssef said.  Bitcoin’s beach day  Historically, Bitcoin adoption has been an organic phenomenon. Even in El Salvador, grassroots efforts like Bitcoin Beach were in place long before Bukele’s initiative. Bitcoin Beach, which started in 2019, is a project that seeks to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange in El Salvador’s small coastal villages like El Zonte and Punta Mango.  “There was no compulsion in those early days in Bitcoin Beach. That was the magic of the whole thing. And because the compulsion came afterwards, when the government level [got involved], it did sour the pot and caused a lot of distrust,” Youssef said.  The organic approach seems to be the most successful route to hyperbitcoinization thus far. Bitcoin Beach is the poster child of “circular” bitcoin economies where individuals receive and make payments in bitcoin. Similar communities have since cropped up all over the world:  Bitcoin Lake is a project in Panajachel, Guatemala, that helps locals mine bitcoin with equipment powered by secondhand cooking oil. The project was started by Patrick Melder and not only promotes bitcoin adoption, but also helps clean up pollution in the adjacent Lake Atitlán.     Bitcoin Island, which is officially Boracay Island, is a tourist hot spot in the Philippines. Lightning Network wallet provider Pouch started a bitcoin education campaign on the island and encourages tourists to “live off bitcoin at 200+ locations including resorts, fine dining, water sports and more.”     Bitcoin Ekasi is a nonprofit organization that has established a bitcoin economy in Mossel Bay, South Africa. Paxful and Built with Bitcoin, Paxful’s nonprofit arm, recently donated money to build an educational center for Bitcoin Ekasi.  “Built with Bitcoin is a 501(c)(3) non-for-profit I started several years ago, and Built with Bitcoin is the one that builds all the schools, builds all the wells, and Paxful is one of the main sponsors of Built with Bitcoin,” Youssef said.  The Global South  Built with Bitcoin has also built two schools in Nigeria, demonstrating Youssef’s commitment to not only Africa, but also the entire Global South (Africa, Asia, Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean).  “The Global South is very interesting, particularly places like Africa, because the people there don't need anything,” Youssef remarked. “They are under such restrictive financial regimes, that honestly, it's a miracle they're not extinct. They're ingenuity and resourcefulness will create amazing wealth.”  Read more: Bitcoin Nonprofit ₿trust Launches Africa Open Source Cohort; Names First Developer  It seems a winning formula for hyperbitcoinization is beginning to take shape – organic growth in the Global South, facilitated by nonprofits. Youssef believes the Global South demographic, which numbers in the billions, is more receptive to bitcoin’s original use case and will therefore act as the torchbearer of hyperbitcoinization and ultimately reap the benefits.  “People there are enormously talented and very well educated. They're very ambitious, and all they need is just to have an equal shake at being able to transact,” Youssef said. “Once that happens, they'll create their own wealth.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/24/hyperbitcoinization-is-coming-to-an-emerging-market-near-you-an-interview-with-paxfuls-ray-youssef,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29a80b31e5dfa7bc21b9afdcf3aa283133fa9ed4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The U.S. Trustee in the case argued that an ombudsman was needed if Celsius is going to sell customer lists, a position the judge agreed with. But Celsius argued there was no need to appoint an ombudsman because any sale will automatically comply with its own privacy policy.  The judge’s decision follows the release of more than 29,000 pages of court documents in early October that revealed the financial details of hundreds of thousands of Celsius’ customers.  The information appears to have been released as part of standard bankruptcy procedure as Celsius makes its way through the Chapter 11 restructuring process after freezing customer accounts in July. About 600,000 customer accounts are affected by the disclosure, revealing their wallet addresses, transaction histories, crypto holdings, recent transactions and other information.  Celsius reluctantly agreed to the release of its customer information, arguing it would “reduce” the resale value of its customer list. In the end, users’ email and home addresses were allowed to be redacted.  Glenn cited court precedent and inadequate proof that doxxing users would put them at risk in his initial decision to compel the release of customer information.  “Sealing information such as that sought by the Debtors [Celsius] from public disclosure risks transforming the open and transparent bankruptcy process into something very different, which the Court is loath to do without a strong showing of real and not speculative risks,” Judge Glenn wrote in a September court filing.

Bank of America also wrote that Meta’s huge investment in the metaverse is likely to remain an “overhang” on the stock, noting that analysts are unlikely to back out metaverse spend from earnings per share (EPS) for valuation purposes given the lack of progress with users, potential new competition from Apple and a “higher cost of capital mindset.”  It is expected that the European Digital Markets Act and numerous reviews of Section 230 liability protection will remain as “hard-to-quantify sentiment overhangs on the stock,” which may deter value-focused buyers, the report said.  Meta should address investor concerns about Instagram usage headwinds, spending on building the metaverse given the perceived lack of user traction, high capital expenditures that are impacting free cash flow (FCF), Reels content quality and margins and progress and a timeline for targeting improvements, the note added.

But why would anyone bother with these markets when they can trade spot? We’ll explain.  Crypto derivatives – explained  Derivatives are financial contracts that relate to some claim about an underlying asset – in this instance cryptocurrencies. There are innumerable such contracts but two dominate in cryptocurrencies: futures and options.  Futures contracts are financial instruments that represent claims to buy or sell an asset in the future at a predetermined price. They say something like, “I agree to buy bitcoin for $20,000 next June, no matter its price today.”  Options contracts are similar but they provide the option, and not the obligation, to buy that asset in the future. For instance, the agreement might be: “You agree to sell me your bitcoin for $20,000 next June, if I want it at that time. If I don’t, you keep it.” Like futures contracts, options contracts are bets on the future price of bitcoin – although options have a get-out clause.  In crypto, there is also something called a perpetual futures or perpetual swap contract, which is a futures contract that never expires and can be held indefinitely.  There are countless more derivatives contracts in conventional finance, such as banker's acceptance, forwards and swaps, each of which greases the wheels of the financial markets in a slightly different way.  Crypto has many other unique products that can be categorized as derivatives, such as stETH, a derivative token that represents claims on ETH staked in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system. But this piece is focused on the contracts that will be familiar to those who have traded traditional finance derivatives.  Why trade crypto options and futures?  Options and futures contracts represent bets on the future price of a cryptocurrency. But so does spot trading, where speculators buy low in an attempt to sell high in the future. So why bother with derivatives trading?  Leverage  One answer is simple: leverage. Options and derivatives contracts allow you to buy more cryptocurrencies with your capital than a simple spot trade. When a trader locks in a price to buy, say, bitcoin in six months, they only have to put up a fraction of the price of that bitcoin today.  While they promise to have the money in the future – and will be liquidated if it looks like they won’t be able to afford the trade – they have bought bitcoin on the cheap. So, when they come to sell that bitcoin after the contract expires, the trader could magnify their profits. Of course, they could just as easily magnify their losses.  You can also gain leverage with spot trades to increase by borrowing money to fund your trade. This, of course, magnifies risk. A trade made on 2.5x leverage could increase profits by 2.5x – but they could also increase losses by the same amount.  Managing risk and hedging  Another answer is that derivatives let traders shuffle their money around to manage risk – known as hedging. In the real world, farmers like derivatives because they can lock in a price for their crop to avoid worrying about price volatility. For instance, a soybean farmer can sell crops before they are even planted through soybean futures contracts. It allows a farmer to budget for that set price without worrying about huge fluctuations that could rise or fall depending on inflation or if the marketplace is flooded with a hearty soybean harvest.  On the buying side of the contract, the buyer gets to lock in what he hopes will be a lower price than market rates in the future, but meanwhile she can use that capital to invest however she wants. It’s the same with cryptocurrencies – until the contract matures, a trader can do what he likes with the rest of how money – it isn’t locked up in a bitcoin trade.  Regulatory oversight  Regulation provides a third answer. If you want to trade bitcoin on a regular exchange like Schwab or Fidelity – i.e., not a cryptocurrency exchange – one of your only choices is to use derivatives like bitcoin futures or options on bitcoin futures.  There are also cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and trusts on many traditional exchanges. These are financial vehicles that hold bitcoin on behalf of their investors, then trade on a regular stock exchange, just like Google or Apple stock.  However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has long denied applications for a spot bitcoin ETF on the premise that the price of bitcoin is inherently manipulable. It has, however, approved ETFs for bitcoin futures. So, derivatives contracts are useful for those who want to invest in bitcoin but can only do so within the walls of the conventional financial system.

42394493,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw95eN,1666623590,Crypto Order Types 101: From Market to Limit,"Traders have access to a variety of trade types that help them take advantage of volatility or protect them from market shocks. This article explains the four main order types for spot trades – limit, market, stop and instant – to help you make an informed decision while trading cryptocurrencies.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  Market order  Market orders are standard crypto trades. It’s a simple command to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at the best available price on that exchange. In practice, that means buying or selling a cryptocurrency at its most recent price. So if the most recent bitcoin trade valued the coin at $20,000, the exchange’s market price is $20,000.  An exchange’s order book is really just a long, constantly updated list of buyers and sellers. As such, the market price is always being updated and represents the freshest price of a cryptocurrency on that exchange.  Market orders, also known as spot orders, are the easiest orders to implement on an exchange and are executed almost instantly. All you have to do is enter how much cryptocurrency you would like to buy or sell. Then the exchange will match you with an open order in the order book.  As you are taking liquidity out of the order book, you will be subject to what exchanges call a “taker fee.” Limit orders (explained below) are subject to lower maker fees.  The price of a cryptocurrency may vary across exchanges. This is because each exchange maintains its own market for cryptocurrencies. However, market prices for major cryptocurrencies rarely vary much across exchanges. A select group of traders, known as arbitrageurs, profit by taking advantage of minor price differences across exchanges. This ​​crypto arbitrage trading smooths out price differences quickly.  Instant order  Instant orders are fairly interchangeable with market orders. The only difference, if any, is that instant orders involve exchanges of fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar, for cryptocurrencies, while market orders are denominated in cryptocurrencies.  When placing an instant order to, say, buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin, the exchange seeks out sellers to fulfill your trade. Your trade might come from multiple sellers; the exchange will keep plugging away at your trade until your trade has been completely matched, with each tranche executed at the current market price of the cryptocurrency.  Limit order  Limit orders let you place an order to buy or sell cryptocurrencies at a certain price. You’ll have to tell the exchange how much you want to buy or sell and the limit of the price you’re willing to accept.  For instance, you might place a limit order to buy one bitcoin for $20,000, but no more. That’s useful if you predict that the price of bitcoin will fall to $20,000, and want to buy the coin as soon as it reaches your preferred price. Alternatively, you might place a limit order to sell one bitcoin for no less than $21,000. That’s useful if you want to sell bitcoin as soon as the price of BTC reaches $21,000.  The advantage of limit orders is they allow buyers or sellers to trade at their preferred price without constantly scanning the market. This allows them to take advantage of price swings while not being glued to their screens 24/7.  The downside is these orders are not guaranteed to execute, and may never go through if the cryptocurrency never reaches a certain price specified in the limit order. Yet, as mentioned above, they are often cheaper to execute as the “maker fee” for these trades is lower than the “taker fee.”  Stop-loss and stop-limit orders  Stop orders are orders that activate once a specified price, known as a stop price, has been met. So if you placed a stop order to buy bitcoin at $20,000, once bitcoin hits that price the order becomes a market order to buy bitcoin.  These orders are not visible to the market until that price point has been reached. However, the risk is they may fill at a price higher than you wanted to pay.  For instance: You enter a stop order to buy bitcoin as soon as it reaches $20,000, but because of a sudden jump in price or a huge backlog of orders it ends up being fulfilled at $21,000.  More commonly you’ll see people set a trigger for a stop loss order, which triggers a sell order when the asset crosses that line at the next available price. So you can put in a stop-loss order to sell bitcoin if it crosses the $19,000 mark. But similar to the above example, it does not guarantee a price, and in a rapid sell-off or flash crash you could end up fulfilling your order at $18,000 or lower.  To compensate for this, consider the “stop-limit” order, which allows you to set a range – keeping with the stop-loss example, you can set a minimum price for which you’re willing to sell. So you can set the order to sell bitcoin at $19,000 but with a lower limit price of $17,000. If the price plummets below that $17,000 before your order is filled, your bitcoin would remain in your account, unsold. You can flip this and do the same and set a high range for a buy price, protecting you from paying more than you want to for an asset.

42394184,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY3a5,1666621742,Why Trading Is Essential for Crypto,"A disclosure: I have always thought that the price of crypto assets is their least interesting feature. By now any traders reading this are probably howling in disgust, and I don’t disagree with that reaction – my point is that crypto is about so much more than “alpha.” Nevertheless, I acknowledge that trading is a key factor in the industry’s growth, and deserves more respect than my glib comments might imply.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week. Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and sister company Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  This is worth unpacking a bit. First of all, what do I mean by “trading”? For the purposes of this discussion, “trading” involves the buying and selling of crypto assets and related derivatives on a short time horizon with a view to making a profit. I also have in mind individuals and institutions who explicitly are there to make a profit based on their decisions, rather than market makers who trade based on client moves and who provide a necessary market infrastructure function. Of course, this is a simplification, but it helps to differentiate “trading” from longer-term “investing.”  Why? Because “investing” is what grows industries and wealth. Put idle money to work where it can help build businesses, ecosystems and entire economies. Get compensated for the longer-term risk. If the project fails, there is usually some residual value, and even if not there’s the takeaway of experience and lessons learned.  “Trading,” on the other hand, is often compared with gambling in that fundamentals have less to do with the outcome. This is usually unfair because good traders can read market signals to build an informed opinion on price direction, and excellent traders are good at detecting changes in sentiment that can change momentum even without new information.  Read more from Trading Week: How Crypto Traders Are Weathering the Bear Market  But signals and sentiment tend to have little to do with an asset’s fundamental outlook, and many traders do not care about the underlying characteristics. They don’t really need to. A friend – founder of a market infrastructure company – once told me: “I’m not here for crypto, I just see a market opportunity.” The implication was that he could just as well be setting up a desk to trade organic coffee beans. It wouldn’t matter to him or his investors, as long as there was money to be made.  Many individual traders are also here for the money. Crypto asset volatility is often cited as a reason for investors to stay away. But for those who think highly of their trading prowess, volatility is a reason to dive in, especially when several platforms offer eye-popping leverage.  This is the main reason a large cohort of crypto “believers” – those of us who are here for the ideology of decentralized finance and/or the technology of independent distributed systems – look down on traders. And not just crypto “believers”: my 20-year-old daughter was explaining to me the other day that one of the main reasons her friends are put off crypto is the “bros” at parties (and they’re usually guys) who think bragging about how much money they’ve made will get them some flattering attention.  And of course there’s the damage done by certain hedge funds with dubious profit-maximization strategies, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms fueled by yield seekers, and those that use liquidity to manipulate prices in order to win big when others lose.  Read More from Trading Week: The Art of Trading Without Trading  Traders have a bad rep, especially when they win and flaunt their winnings. And when they lose they tend to get scant pity.  But here’s the thing: Without traders we wouldn’t have liquid markets, and without liquid markets we would not have institutional interest. And without institutional interest, our industry would still be insignificant, poorly funded, less innovative and more vulnerable to regulatory interference.  Our industry needs traders. They provide liquidity which, in theory, leads to less volatile markets. They keep markets honest by acting on price irregularities, ferreting out overlooked information, and facilitating the expression of opinion. Traders enable prices to respond to information fast. They encourage innovation in exchange technology and asset sophistication, which makes the market more robust. They act on information that is not valuable to a longer-term investor but which adds greater depth to the messaging inherent in prices.  And the more traders that pile in because crypto is the “Wild West,” the more regulatory attention the market attracts and the less of a Wild West it becomes.  As for their motivations, who cares? (Except for the guys thinking my daughter will like them because they are clever traders. I mean really, wise up.) No two people are involved in this space for exactly the same reasons and with exactly the same skill set. That diversity of thought and background is one of the ecosystem’s most prominent strengths. And there’s nothing wrong with wanting to make money – the profit motive underpins the modern economy, and the freedom to pursue it legally is one of the great advantages of our society.  Just like entrepreneurs, managers, artists and chief financial officers who put their experience and skill set to work building out innovative Web3 ideas, traders contribute a particularly valuable function toward making this industry viable.  Read More from Trading Week: Outsmart Yourself: Become a Better Crypto Trader by Avoiding the Top Cognitive Biases  What’s more, it works out: Traders who are just here out of self-interest inadvertently support the crypto ethos by making the market more decentralized and resilient. They may not care about the promise of individual empowerment and censorship resistance but their presence makes that a feature of crypto markets by mitigating the opportunity for the wealthy to exert undue control, and by ensuring the dissemination of relevant information in the form of unencumbered pricing.  And the liquidity they provide fosters trust in crypto pricing that in turn encourages more investment. This strengthens many potential crypto use cases by providing resources as well as the incentive to build products the market will value.  Bitcoin may have gotten its start at the grass-roots level, with no marketing whatsoever, based on the appeal of an idea. But without the potential for profit, it would have remained just that.  In an industry built on a new concept of trust, traders counterintuitively make the industry more trustworthy. The short-term outlook enables longer-term investors to have more confidence in the market, which in turn encourages more longer-term investment.  So, to all who think traders are short-term opportunists who give our industry a bad name, just imagine what it would look like without them. A truly decentralized system is open to all. And traders, whatever their motives, help to reinforce that decentralization.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/24/why-cryptocurrency-trading-is-essential,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3429dacd8f394b9037228dbda41fc0f30eeb7d0a-5120x2880.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  Some dismiss technical analysis as pseudo-science while others have built empires on the techniques, profiting immensely by spotting obscure “cup and handles” or “Bart Simpson haircut” formations in the charts and taking action before the markets act out their predictions.  This guide is an entry to this strange and somewhat mystical world. It teaches the fundamental patterns and trends that these analysts use to inform their predictions about the market.  Flag  This price trend resembles a flag. It is first composed of a “pole” – the mast of the flag, where the price of an asset jolts upward or downward amid a flurry of trading volume – and then a quieter period of consolidation, known as the “flag.” During the flag, the market flips the other way for a period of time before breaking out in the direction of the pole.  There are two types of flags: bull flags and bear flags. Bull flags are flag patterns that trend upward, hinting at a future price rise. Bear flags are those that appear in downtrends, when the analyst that spots them predicts that prices will fall.  Flag formations are useful because an analyst could infer that an upward or downward price spiral is about to happen. Check the image on the left in the chart above: The first rise is the “pole.” The flag’s pole rises until traders have decided that enough is enough and it is time to sell.  That’s when the price takes a nosedive. But the price oscillates for a period, trending downward while trading volumes decline. When you overlay parallel trend lines over this oscillation on the chart, the image starts to look a little like a “flag.”  Read More from Trading Week: Crypto Order Types 101: From Market to Limit  Then comes a breakout – another pole – and a confident drive upward that surpasses this period of consolidation. The bull/bear flag formation is over when the prices no longer resemble flags.  Pennant  The pennant is another kind of chart formation. A pennant is also a flag, but the kind that looks like a sideways triangle (see below). When charting crypto prices, technical analysts look to pennant formations for bullish or bearish price signals.  In technical analysis, the difference between the flag and the pennant is that with flags the trend lines are horizontal, whereas pennant trend lines converge in the shape of its namesake, a triangular flag:  Apart from the shape of the consolidation period, the pattern for a pennant is pretty much the same as the flag: There is an upward or downward movement, known as the flagpole, followed by a consolidation period marked by low trading volume that precedes a high-volume breakout.  Traders can try to take advantage of a bearish or bullish pennant. To take advantage of a bullish pennant, they might spot higher than usual trading volume in the initial breakout period – the pole.  If so, traders might buy the cryptocurrency during the consolidation period while prices stagnate and volumes swindle. Finally, they’ll wait for another breakout period to occur, selling before the market crashes again.  Sideways trend  Sideways trends, also known as horizontal trends, mark periods of trading when the price doesn’t budge much at all. The technical analyst submits that this is because supply and demand are pretty well balanced, marking an uneasy equilibrium that precedes a price rise or fall.  These periods of unsettling calm are different from the periods of consolidation in the pennant and flag because they tend to (but not always) last for far longer – weeks or months, rather than hours or days.  The technical analyst must eye the chart for potential breakouts in either direction. This might include watching prices like a hawk to check for other trends or scrutinizing trading volumes to work out if the trading volume of sellers matches that of buyers.  Wedges  Wedges are price formations that are identified by two converging trendlines. Unlike pennants, which converge along a horizontal axis, wedges converge in an upwards or downwards direction.  Read More from Trading Week: 9 Survival Tips for Crypto Winter  During the initial phases of the wedge, there are large distances between the upper and lower price swings. Over time, these prices converge and volumes may dwindle. If so, the keen technical analyst may identify this as a signal of a potential price reversal.  Rising wedges converge upward while trading volumes decline. This signals a bearish reversal. Conversely, falling wedges may signal the end of a bad market.

42420950,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtw7x,1666620424,The Art of Trading Without Trading,"In an iconic scene from the 1973 action movie “Enter the Dragon,” a burly thug asks the protagonist, played by martial-arts legend Bruce Lee, what fighting style he uses.  “You could call it ‘the art of fighting without fighting,’” Lee’s character answers.  The brute, who has been terrorizing crew members on the crowded deck of a ship midjourney, asks the hero to demonstrate this style. Lee suggests they take a rowboat to a nearby island where there’s more room to spar. The bully climbs down from the deck onto the rowboat. Lee pretends to follow, but instead grabs the rope tethering the rowboat to the ship, lets the line go slack, and hands it to the crew members, who laugh at the livid oaf now at their mercy.  The $900 billion global cryptocurrency markets can be as rough as a fighting tournament, but for investors with patience and discipline there’s a similarly subtle strategy available. It’s known as dollar-cost averaging (DCA). You could call it the art of trading without trading.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Trading Week series.  Depending on the asset and an investor’s time horizon, DCA can be more profitable than attempting to buy low and sell high, as active (or compulsive) traders do. What’s more, practicing DCA might help you preserve your sanity.  What is dollar-cost averaging?  To be clear, DCA is a method of trading, and among crypto users, particularly bitcoin (BTC) holders, it has come to mean something slightly different than in mainstream financial markets.  Broadly, dollar-cost averaging means buying (or selling) the same dollar amount of an asset at regular intervals, disregarding short-term price movements – rather than buying (or selling) the entire lump sum when you think the market has bottomed (or peaked). As the name suggests, on average you should, in theory, pay less in dollar terms for the investment over the long run than if you had tried to time the market.  “To dollar-cost average in or out of a position is a way to execute a trade,” said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, a financial services firm catering to BTC die-hards. “Traditionally, you would accumulate using dollar-cost averaging in a bear market, and you would … sell out of a position in a bull market using dollar-cost averaging.”  Read more: Dollar Cost Averaging: Build Crypto Wealth on a Budget  However, for dedicated BTC investors, DCA goes only one way.  “We use it in the bitcoin space to mean automatic recurring purchases … regardless of bull market or bear market,” said Klippsten, a bit ruefully.  “I fought against the term for two years,” said Klippsten, who prefers “recurring buys” or “auto DCA” to distinguish this behavior from its old Wall Street namesake. “But, you know, I lost.”  ‘Set it and forget it’  That’s not to say he doesn’t advocate recurring bitcoin buys; on the contrary, helping people make them is Swan’s bread and butter.  “The thesis behind the whole company … is that you'll end up owning way more bitcoin if you ‘set it and forget it,’” Klippsten said. “The person who buys a ton of bitcoin at $60,000” – near the all-time high achieved a year ago – “is much much more likely to sell it at [the recent level of] $20,000 than someone that's just on a steady accumulation program and is actually kind of sanguine and almost happy and peaceful about the price being down because they're getting to buy more bitcoin for the same number of dollars.”  The big idea behind DCA, whether the traditional or bitcoiner version, is that for individual investors trying to outsmart the market, in pretty much any financial asset, is a fool’s errand.  “In a lot of markets, the people who trade most suboptimally are retail investors who check the price a lot and trade a lot,” said Byrne Hobart, writer of The Diff, a popular financial newsletter. “They turn out to do that in fairly predictable ways.”  Read more: Compounding and Saving in Bitcoin: The Power of a Dollar-Cost Averaging Strategy  Hence, the quantitative analysts employed by professional trading desks spend much of their time “looking at different kinds of seasonal patterns and intraday patterns and realizing this is when retail investors become less price sensitive and really move things,” Hobart said. “So you don't want to be the source of somebody else's alpha,” i.e., their above-market returns. “And one way to avoid that is just [investing] systematically.”  This is as true in crypto as in stocks, Klippsten argued.  “You’re going against 24-7 markets and all these sophisticated desks,” he said. “You’re trading against Alameda and Jump and SAC. Those guys all make fun of click traders” – the plebeians who execute their trades with a keyboard or mouse. “Real traders, in crypto and financial markets … have their computers placing all the trades and eating your margin and arbitraging everything away.”  What asset, and for how long?  To commit to dollar-cost averaging, you need to have reason to believe the asset you select will appreciate over time, even if its price whipsaws from day to day. Simply setting up recurring buys is no substitute for due diligence. It always bears repeating: Investors need to do their research.  “You have to buy what you know,” said Klippsten. “Unless you have deep conviction about bitcoin, you can’t buy and hold this stuff very well” and are liable to sell in a panic when the price dips.  A self-described bitcoiner (he considers the oft-used term “bitcoin maximalist” an epithet), Klippsten sees the original cryptocurrency as the only one suitable for dollar-cost averaging. “I don’t think any non-bitcoin crypto will be around for the long term,” he said. “So it doesn't make any sense to be accumulating these things. They're there for trading, or for pumping and dumping.”  Even if you disagree on that score, the broader point stands that DCA has to be undertaken in service of an investment thesis. If a cryptocurrency’s main selling point is a cute dog mascot, for example, or if it has the word “baby” in the name, it’s probably not a candidate for this strategy.  Read more: Missed the Bitcoin Rally? Here’s a Low-Risk Strategy to Ride the Bull Market (2020)  “Part of what you're doing with dollar-cost averaging is you're deciding what is the investable universe of meaningful tokens that are not actually going to go to zero,” said Hobart. “Most people in crypto sort of agree partway with the total crypto skeptics that a lot of this stuff is going to zero. Not every token is a winner.”  Further, even for assets that perform in the long run, profitability depends on the investor’s time horizon. According to an online calculator provided by trading platform Uphold, an investor who bought $100 worth of bitcoin a month starting two years ago, investing a total of $2,400, would now be down about 37%.  However, if the investor started the same strategy a year earlier, in October 2019, she’d be up 20% on the $3,600 she put in – and if she’d started a decade ago, her $12,000 investment would have skyrocketed over 5,000%.  Timing isn’t just an issue for when to buy, but also in the life cycle of the buyer.  “The people for whom dollar-cost averaging in crypto would have the most appeal are people who are young and are willing to take risks, but they know that the bulk of their earnings, the bulk of their savings, are happening far in the future. So it's OK if things dropped by half,” said Hobart. “Whereas if someone is retiring next year, and 100% of their savings go into dollar-cost averaging crypto … well, you know, there have been a lot of pretty fearsome drawdowns. And so that's probably not the right time or the right approach.”  The limits of autopilot  There are other big-picture considerations.  “Question No. 1 is, what is your portfolio strategy?” said Richard S. Bookbinder, a 40-year Wall Street veteran who helped found the middle-market investment bank Sandler O’Neill. “Whether it’s Apple or bitcoin, how much of it do you want to own? When would you be willing to add more to it? What is your optimal size threshold for pain in that position and how large would you like it to be in your portfolio?”  That, in turn, suggests that even when embarking on DCA, investors can’t go on autopilot, and that as new information comes in they may need to update their priors and adjust their strategy accordingly.  “When assets go down, people become very, very fearful and in most cases that's the wrong time to sell the position – or to do nothing at all,” said Bookbinder, now an adjunct professor and distinguished executive-in-residence at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland. Investors like to tell themselves the price always comes back, but “as we've learned so often, that's not necessarily the case.”  Read more: Buying Your First Crypto? 10 Things You Should Know (2021)  “Adjusting” does not necessarily mean “panic selling.” Investors could simply lighten up on the buying if they have new reason to doubt their thesis (or ramp it up, if they are convinced the sell-off is temporary and they have an opportunity to lower the cost basis).  In other words, an investment thesis does not demand the same level of devotion as getting married or joining the French Foreign Legion.  “One of the things that I tell students all the time is that in investing you have to be agnostic,” Bookbinder said. It would be naive to buy a stock “because ‘I like the product, it's nice to touch and hold and feel’ – forget about that! Is this company going to be a business in five years, in 10 years? What does its balance sheet look like? What's the management team?”  Make a list  The Diff’s Hobart recommends that before dollar-cost averaging, crypto investors make a list of events that would make them want to stop accumulating the asset. For some, the dealbreaker might be a “flippening” (ether, the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market cap, overtaking bitcoin, the longtime leader); for others, it could be crypto getting banned in a certain country.  “I find that coming up with those kinds of lists early on, especially things where I think ‘this would be bad news, this will make the price go down, but I don't think this is an existential threat,’ is a really good idea,” he said. “It's really hard to think reasonably when your portfolio is down by half, whereas if you think in advance about what kinds of news would make the price drop but not interfere much with the long-term thesis, then you can be in a better position. A lot of money has been made historically by people who say ‘the news is bad, but it's not that bad.’”  Read more: Addicted to Crypto?  Even Swan’s Klippsten sees bitcoin as “the third leg” of a family wealth-building program, not the only thing an investor should ever buy. The first leg is a traditional retirement account.  “Obviously, you want to max out anything that's tax-advantaged, or anything that your employer matches, so you should do the maximum amount you can for your IRA for your 401(k) and take the free money,” he said. The virtue of automatic paycheck deductions is that “you're going to do it no matter what. That's not discretionary income that you can spend on pizza or spring break or something.”  The second leg is paying down the mortgage to build equity in a home. Again, this imposes the discipline to save. “You’re going to be forced to make that payment … because you want to keep the house,” Klippsten said.  Touch grass  The caveats above aside, automated investing through dollar-cost averaging has one more potential advantage over active trading, one that goes beyond economics: It could be better for your soul.  For many users, trading crypto and constantly checking prices on the smartphone have become another digital addiction, as pernicious as compulsively scrolling social media or watching online porn.  “What we have in our hands are basically weapons that most people are using all day, every day as a form of entertainment,” said James Poulos, founder of RETURN, an online magazine that promotes healthier living in a hyperconnected society. “I would suggest that that is a very unstable and dangerous way of life.”  Read more: 'I Totally Obsessed Over It.' How Crypto Addiction Almost Ruined My Life  Poulos, who also edits The American Mind, an erudite blog published by the conservative Claremont Institute think tank, counsels against “looking at bitcoin as a sort of crazy form of entertainment with a nuke brain emoji and soy-facing about how amazing it is.”  Such behavior is understandable, he said, “in a world where young people think, ‘well, there's definitely no way that I can become prosperous or even really get paid a fair value for my labors through our current financial system. Maybe I'll try this other thing and get super excited and get my friends rich.’ It's a natural kind of reaction.”  Nevertheless, “if you want to use bitcoin, not just to walk away from a system that is built to prevent you from flourishing, then you have to use bitcoin in a way that is actually going to be conducive to your flourishing,” said Poulos.  “For me, the foundation of that is to not use it for speculation, to not use it as just another set of numbers on another set of graphs, something that you dip in and dip out of and try to play the market the same way that you would any other sort of abstracted commodity,” but rather as a way to “build stuff.”  Poulos practices what he preaches: His book “Human, Forever” is sold on Canonic, a site that accepts payment in bitcoin and two of its offshoots, BCH and BSV, and lets authors mint and sell non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the BSV blockchain.  Swan’s Klippsten admitted that when he first got into crypto he set up trading alerts on mobile portfolio-tracking apps like Blockfolio and Delta.  “If you're chasing positions and trying to do all this active stuff, you might be like I was, on vacation with my family in Palm Springs and I have alerts going off on my phone at 6 a.m. and I'm jumping up to place trades on my phone,” he said.  By contrast, dollar-cost averaging offers a way to invest in bitcoin, or another crypto, and still have a life.  “What most people should be doing is the same thing they would be doing if bitcoin or crypto didn't exist,” Klippsten said. “It's ludicrous to think that because bitcoin and crypto exist you have to be a crypto trader.”",POSITIVE,BTC | BSV,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | BSV,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/24/dollar-cost-averaging-dca-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/495d493bce2d6eb4bf960f763dd27abe4652ffce-3600x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415336,StAfe08axvsa87cUIBdBzT,1666618505,Court Refuses to Dismiss 'Insider-Trading' Case Against Former OpenSea Exec,"A federal indictment of Nate Chastain, a former head of product at NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace OpenSea, can proceed, a federal judge ruled Friday.  Chastain was indicted in June on allegations of insider trading, and charged with wire fraud and money laundering. Chastain filed a motion to dismiss the charges in August, arguing that the government didn't have enough evidence to support a money-laundering charge and that he didn't ""misappropriate"" information. He thus couldn't be charged with wire fraud, he argued, and also couldn't be charged with insider trading because the NFTs he allegedly traded were neither securities nor commodities under the relevant part of the law.  In denying Chastain's motion, U.S. District Court Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York said two of Chastain's arguments – that prosecutors may not be able to prove that the NFTs are not ""property"" and that he didn't engage in the actions that would prove money laundering – might have merit, but should be presented before a jury, rather than in a dismissal motion.  Chastain's third argument – that he didn't engage in insider trading because that requires a security or a commodity to be traded – doesn't hold up at all, Furman wrote, as prosecutors didn't charge Chastain with an insider trading-related allegation.  ""Chastain seizes on two references in the indictment and statements made by the government (in a press release and at the initial conference in this case) to assert that he is charged with 'insider trading,'"" Furman wrote.  ""But he is not charged with insider trading, at least in the classic sense of the term, which is a means of engaging in securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934... Instead, he is charged with wire fraud in violation of Section 1343. See Indictment ¶ 13. And in contrast to Section 10(b), which is limited to fraud 'in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,' Section 1343 makes no reference to securities or commodities.""  Violation of rights?  On the same day Furman's ruling came out, Chastain filed three other memos, arguing that his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights were violated, supporting an argument he first made at the end of September.  Specifically, Chastain's attorneys wrote that FBI agents didn't read Chastain's Miranda rights to him before questioning him or asking for his cellphone password and collecting evidence from it. As a result, Chastain's attorneys are asking for any evidence collected – including the contents of his cellphone – during the execution of a search warrant be suppressed because Chastain ""was subjected to a custodial interrogation during the execution of the search warrant,"" even though he wasn't under arrest at the time.  ""No reasonable person would have felt free to leave an analogous encounter in which several FBI agents demanded entry into their home in the early hours of the morning, wearing bulletproof vests, carrying holstered firearms and presenting them with a warrant that authorized a search of their person,"" the filing said.  The cellphone's contents were also not within the scope of the search warrant, the attorneys wrote.  In a separate filing, Chastain asked the court to order the Department of Justice to stop using the phrase ""insider trading,"" calling it ""prejudicial and inflammatory.""  ""The term’s presence in the indictment – and any reference to it at a trial – serves no legitimate prosecutorial purpose and is simply a means of increasing media attention and inflaming the jury in this first-of-its-kind case in the digital asset space,"" Chastain's attorneys wrote.

42394504,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw96dv,1666617793,The Dreaded Death Cross and Shining Golden Cross: Two Important Crypto Indicators,"For many people, trading cryptocurrencies simply involves buying and holding particular coins in the hope that the coins will appreciate in value over time. For other traders, however, trading cryptocurrencies involves reading the markets, studying price charts and identifying telltale signs that hint an asset might rise or fall soon.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  Those telltale signs are known broadly as chart patterns and are characterized by specific shapes that appear in an asset's candlestick chart that typically foreshadow the next movement.  Whether the technical indicators are self-fulfilling or the result of mass-market psychology continues to be a hotly debated topic, but what we do know is certain chart patterns tend to accurately predict changes in the market. The most prominent of those chart patterns are known as the death cross and the golden cross.  What is a death cross in crypto trading?  The death cross is a chart pattern that signals a growing weakness in an asset’s price. It comprises two separate lines called “moving averages.”  Each moving average line (MA) is formed by calculating the average price over a certain period of time and using those points to create a smoothed line. For example, for a five-day moving average, the average of each five-day subset is calculated and then a line is drawn that connects those data points.  If trading activity suddenly spikes bullish – more traders start buying an asset – the line will rise, and vice versa.  The death cross pattern uses the 50-day MA and the 200-day MA. These longer time frames mean that the lines are less affected by short-term movements and are therefore more useful for gauging long-term sentiment, or what the general tone of the market is.  As the averages indicate, the 50-day MA is calculated using a much shorter time frame than the 200-day MA. This means the 50-day average tracks the short-term price more closely than the 200-day average does, and so when the 50-day MA line crosses beneath the 200-day MA line, it indicates that short-term momentum is in a decline versus the last 200 days. That usually indicates a change in the mid- to long-term price trend, and the divergence between the two lines (the 50-day MA crossing down through the 200-day MA) is what’s known as the “death cross.”  Despite the bearish connotations of a death cross, it’s often welcomed by some traders as an upcoming opportunity to buy the asset at a discounted price. As legendary American investor Warren Buffett once famously said, “Buy when there’s blood in the streets.” The expression essentially translates to buy when everyone else is selling.  Read More: 4 Tips to Maximize Your Crypto Investment  How can you spot a golden cross?  The golden cross is a technical pattern that occurs when the short-term average price moves above a longer-term average price. If the short-term price is higher than the longer-term price, it indicates that recent sentiment around an asset's price is optimistic and may be preceded by a breakout (a phenomenon seen by upward momentum in an asset's price).  When traders spot a golden cross, it is seen as a positive indicator, and traders are able to build a strategy around their interpretation of the indicator. The most common averages used when searching for golden crosses are the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Traders will often use shorter average price movements to spot golden crosses, as well. However, the longer the averages used when hunting for a golden cross, the stronger the indicator is in terms of foreshadowing upward price movement.  As one navigates trading cryptos, it’s important to understand these technical patterns and have the skill to determine what they may foreshadow. Regardless of your trading style, the indicators offer valuable insight to market sentiment and future price movements. An understanding of these time-tested patterns can provide valuable insight into trading strategies, or even something as simple as timing when to buy or sell an asset.  How reliable are golden/death crosses?  Death crosses and golden crosses have been seen to be reliable trading signals. It is important to understand your own personal investing goals. If you are a long-term buyer and prefer to hold assets, these crosses may be a good signal for buying strategies. If you are attempting to trade assets more actively, crosses represent signals that can be interpreted for both buying and selling opportunities, although it would be wise to use other signals to help with your trading.

42394500,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw96JP,1666617715,Crypto Arbitrage Trading: How to Make Low-Risk Gains,"Crypto arbitrage trading is a type of trading strategy where investors capitalize on slight price discrepancies of a digital asset across multiple markets or exchanges. In its simplest form, crypto arbitrage trading is the process of buying a digital asset on one exchange and selling it (just about) simultaneously on another where the price is higher.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  Doing so means making profits through a process that involves little or no risks. The other great thing about this strategy is you don’t have to be a professional investor with an expensive set-up in order to begin arbitrage trading.  What is arbitrage trading?  Arbitrage has been a mainstay of traditional financial markets long before the emergence of the crypto market. And yet, there seems to be more hype surrounding the potential of arbitrage opportunities in the crypto scene.  This is most likely because the crypto market is renowned for being highly volatile compared to other financial markets. This means crypto asset prices tend to deviate significantly over a certain time period. Because crypto assets are traded globally across hundreds of exchanges 24/7, there are far more opportunities for arbitrage traders to find profitable price discrepancies.  All a trader would need to do is spot a difference in the pricing of a digital asset across two or more exchanges and execute a series of transactions to take advantage of the difference.  For example, let’s assume the price of bitcoin is $45,000 on the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange and $45,200 on Kraken. In this scenario, crypto arbitrageurs might spot this disparity and buy bitcoin on Coinbase and sell it on Kraken to pocket the $200 price difference. This is a typical example of a crypto arbitrage trade.  Read more: 4 Tips to Maximize Your Crypto Investment  Why are crypto exchange prices different?  Centralized exchanges  The first thing you need to be know is the pricing of assets on centralized exchanges depends on the most recent bid-ask matched order on the exchange order book. In other words, the most recent price at which a trader buys or sells a digital asset on an exchange is considered the real-time price of that asset on the exchange.  For instance, if the order to buy bitcoin for $60,000 is the most recently matched order on an exchange, this price becomes the latest price of bitcoin on the platform. The next matched order after this will also determine the next price of the digital asset. Therefore, price discovery on exchanges is a continuous process of stipulating the market price of a digital asset based on its most recent selling price.  Note that the price also tends to vary because investor demand for an asset is slightly different on each exchange.  Decentralized exchanges  Decentralized crypto exchanges, however, use a different method for pricing crypto assets. Known as an “automated market maker” system, this directly relies on crypto arbitrage traders to keep prices in line with those shown across other exchanges.  Here, instead of an order book system where buyers and sellers are matched together to trade crypto assets at a certain price and amount, decentralized exchanges rely on liquidity pools. For every crypto trading pair, a separate pool must be created. For example, if someone wished to trade ether (ETH) for link (LINK) they would need to locate an ETH/LINK liquidity pool on the exchange.  Each pool is funded by voluntary contributors who deposit their own crypto assets to provide liquidity that others trade against in exchange for a proportionate share of the pool’s transaction fees. The main benefit of this system is that traders don’t have to wait for a counterparty (an opposite trader) to buy or sell assets at a certain price. Trading can be executed at any time.  Across most popular decentralized exchanges, the prices of both assets in the pool (A and B) are maintained by a mathematical formula. This formula keeps the ratio of assets in the pool balanced.  What this means is, when a trader wishes to buy ether from the ETH/LINK pool, he would have to add LINK tokens to the pool in order to remove ETH tokens from it. When this happens, it causes the ratio of assets to change (more LINK tokens in the pool and less ETH.) In order to restore balance, the protocol automatically lowers the price of LINK and increases the price of ETH. This encourages traders to remove the cheaper LINK and add ETH until the prices realign with the rest of the market.  In circumstances where a trader changes the ratio significantly in a pool (executes a large trade), it can create big differences in the prices of the assets in the pool compared to their market value (the average price reflected across all other exchanges).  Read more: What Is an Automated Market Maker?  Types of crypto arbitrage strategies  There are several ways crypto arbitrageurs can profit off of market inefficiencies. Some of them are:  Cross-exchange arbitrage: This is the basic form of arbitrage trading where a trader tries to generate profit by buying crypto on one exchange and selling it on another exchange.  Spatial arbitrage: This is another form of cross-exchange arbitrage trading. The only difference is that the exchanges are located in different regions. For example, you could capitalize on the difference in the demand and supply of bitcoin in America and South Korea using the spatial arbitrage method.  Triangular arbitrage: This is the process of moving funds between three or more digital assets on a single exchange to capitalize on the price discrepancy of one or two cryptocurrencies. For example, a trader can create a trading loop that starts with bitcoin and ends with bitcoin.  A trader could exchange bitcoin for ether, then trade the ether for Cardano’s ADA token and, lastly, convert the ADA back to bitcoin. In this example, the trader moved their fund between three crypto trading pairs – BTC/ETH → ETH/ADA → ADA/BTC. If there are discrepancies in any of the prices of the three crypto trading pairs, the trader will end up with more bitcoin than they had at the beginning of the trade. Here, all the transactions are executed on one exchange. Therefore, the trader does not need to withdraw or deposit funds across multiple exchanges.  Decentralized arbitrage: This arbitrage opportunity is common on decentralized exchanges or automated market makers (AMMs), which discover the price of crypto trading pairs with the help of automated and decentralized programs called smart contracts. If the prices of crypto trading pairs are significantly different from their spot prices on centralized exchanges, arbitrage traders can swoop in and execute cross-exchange trades involving the decentralized exchange and a centralized exchange.  Statistical arbitrage: This combines econometric, statistical and computational techniques to execute arbitrage trades at scale. Traders that use this method often rely on mathematical models and trading bots to execute high-frequency arbitrage trades and maximize profit. Trading bots are automated trading mechanisms that execute a high volume of trades at record time based on predefined trading strategies.  Why is crypto arbitrage considered a low-risk strategy?  You might have noticed that, unlike day traders, crypto arbitrage traders do not have to predict the future prices of bitcoin nor enter trades that could take hours or days before they start generating profits.  By spotting arbitrage opportunities and capitalizing on them, traders base their decision on the expectation of generating fixed profit without necessarily analyzing market sentiments or relying on other predictive pricing strategies. Also, depending on the resources available to traders, it is possible to enter and exit an arbitrage trade in seconds or minutes. Bearing these in mind, we can therefore conclude the following:  The risk involved in crypto arbitrage trading is somewhat lower than other trading strategies because it generally does not require predictive analysis.  Arbitrage traders only have to execute trades that last for minutes at most, so the exposure to trading risk is significantly reduced.  However, this does not necessarily mean that crypto arbitrageurs are completely free from risks.  Read more: Mastering Emotions and Managing Risk in Cryptocurrency Trading  Crypto arbitrage trading risks  Certain factors could diminish an arbitrageur’s chances of generating profit. The low-risk nature of arbitrage opportunities has an impact on their profitability; less risk tends to yield low profits. This is why crypto arbitrageurs must execute high volumes of trades to generate substantial gains. What’s more, arbitrage trades aren’t exactly free.  Fees  Remember that arbitrage trading across two exchanges may incur withdrawal, deposit and trading fees. These fees may accumulate and eat into your profits. Using our original example as a case study, let us assume that the withdrawal fees of Coinbase, deposit fees of Kraken and the trading fees of Kraken add up to an extra 2%. The total cost of executing this trade is $45,000 + (2% * $45,000) = $45,900. In other words, the crypto arbitrage trader must have incurred a loss since the potential profit is only $200.  To mitigate the risks of incurring losses due to exorbitant fees, arbitrageurs could choose to limit their activities to exchanges with competitive fees. They could also deposit funds on multiple exchanges and reshuffle their portfolios to take advantage of market inefficiencies.  For example, Bob spots the price disparities between bitcoin on Coinbase and Kraken and decides to go all in. However, instead of moving funds between the two exchanges, Bob already has funds denominated in tether (USDT) on Coinbase and 1 BTC on Kraken. So, all he has to do is sell his 1 BTC on Kraken for $45,200 and buy 1 BTC on Coinbase with $45,000 USDT. At the end of this trade, he still generates the $200 profit and avoids paying withdrawal and deposit fees. Here, the only fee that Bob has to worry about is the trading fee. It is worth mentioning that trading fees are relatively low for traders executing high volumes of trades.  Timing  Crypto arbitrage trading is time sensitive. As more traders capitalize on a particular arbitrage opportunity, the price disparity between the two exchanges tends to disappear.  Let us consider the difference in the profitability of Bob and Sarah due to the timing of their trades. In this scenario, Bob is the first to spot and capitalize on the arbitrage opportunity from our original example. This was followed by an attempt by Sarah to do the same.  When Bob buys bitcoin at $45,000 on Coinbase and sells at $45,020 on Kraken, Sarah may no longer execute this trade at this exact price. Due to the market’s competitive nature, Sarah might have to buy bitcoin on Coinbase for $45,005 and sell on Kraken for $45,015. The convergence of the prices of bitcoin on Coinbase and Kraken will continue until there is no more price disparity to profit off of.  Below are some of the factors that could adversely affect the time it takes to execute crypto arbitrage trades:  The transaction speed of the blockchain: Since you might have to execute cross-exchange transactions, the time it takes to validate such transitions on the blockchain could impact the efficacy of your arbitrage trading strategy. For instance, it takes 10 minutes to one hour to confirm transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. In that time, the market might have moved against you. Therefore, arbitrageurs should stick to blockchains with high transaction speed; or those that are not susceptible to network congestion.  The AML checks of exchanges: It is common for exchanges to undertake anti-money laundering (AML) checks whenever large sums are being moved by a trader. In some cases, such checks could last for weeks. Therefore, you ought to consider the propensity of crypto exchanges to impose extra checks at the point of withdrawal before going ahead with cross-exchange arbitrage trades.  Offline exchange servers: It is not uncommon for crypto exchanges to experience outages (go offline.) In some cases, crypto exchanges may even limit the withdrawal and deposit of specific digital assets for one reason or the other. When this happens, the possibility of capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities instantly diminishes.  Security  Since arbitrage traders have to deposit lots of funds on exchange wallets, they are susceptible to security risks associated with exchange hacks and exit scams. Exit scams occur when a company suddenly halts its operations and carts away with users’ funds. In light of this, it is advisable to carry out due diligence and stick to reputable crypto exchanges.  How to start arbitrage trading  Whether you’re a beginner trader or a veteran investor, the great thing about crypto arbitrage trading is there are a number of platforms available today which automate the process of finding and trading price discrepancies across multiple exchanges. These “set it and forget it” platforms can offer a great passive income opportunity for traders who are looking for a low-risk, hands-off trading solution, and include:  Arbismart  Pionex  Cryptohopper  Further reading on crypto trading  Timing the Crypto Market With RSI (A Beginner’s Guide)  This guide to the RSI indicator will help you in making timely trades and hopefully walk away with a win.

42394492,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw95jV,1666617665,"Crypto Futures Trading, Explained","Futures are a type of derivative trading product. These are regulated trading contracts between two parties and involve an agreement to purchase or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price on a certain date. In the case of bitcoin futures, the underlying asset would be bitcoin.  Futures allow investors to hedge against volatile markets and ensure they can purchase or sell a particular cryptocurrency at a set price in the future. Of course, if the price moves in the opposite direction a trader wishes, they may end up paying more than the market price for bitcoin or selling it at a loss.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  In some circumstances, instead of actually buying or selling a cryptocurrency like bitcoin directly, which involves setting up a crypto wallet and navigating through complicated exchanges, futures contracts allow investors to indirectly gain exposure to bitcoin and potentially profit from its price movements.  Regulated bitcoin futures trading first debuted on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), now known as the Cboe Options Exchange, in late 2017 and was soon followed by contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). While the Cboe product has been discontinued, CME’s futures have since become a huge part of the crypto trading market. On Feb. 16, the rolling 24-hour notional value of all futures contracts across major exchanges in the U.S. and abroad stood at $26.9 billion. Notional value refers to the price of bitcoin multiplied by the number of futures contracts taken out by investors.  Read more: How to Invest in Bitcoin Without Buying BTC  In 2021, CME reported an average daily volume of 10,105 bitcoin futures contracts, up 13% on the previous year.  So what’s so special about crypto futures trading?  How crypto futures trading works  There are three main components to a crypto futures contract.  Expiration date: This refers to the date when the futures contract must be settled. In other words, one party has to buy, and the other has to sell at the pre-agreed price. It’s worth noting, however, that traders can sell on their contracts to other investors before the settlement date if they wish.  Units per contract: This defines how much each contract is worth of the underlying asset and varies from platform to platform. For example, one CME bitcoin futures contract equals 5 bitcoins (denominated in U.S. dollars). One bitcoin futures contract on Deribit, however, equals 10 U.S. dollars worth of bitcoin.  Leverage: To increase the potential gains a trader can make on their futures bet, exchanges allow users to borrow capital to increase their trading size. Again, leverage rates vary greatly between platforms. Kraken allows users to supercharge their trades by up to 50x, whereas FTX reduced its leverage rates from 100x to 20x.  There are also two different ways futures contracts can be settled.  Physically delivered: Meaning upon settlement, the buyer purchases and receives bitcoin.  Cash-settled: Meaning upon settlement, there’s a transfer of cash (usually U.S. dollars) between the buyer and seller.  Crypto futures pricing  Although a crypto futures contract is supposed to closely track the price of the underlying asset, its value can sometimes vary throughout its maturation (as it edges toward its settlement date). This is usually caused by sudden sharp changes in volatility, which can be brought on by a fundamental catalyst such as Tesla buying up more bitcoin or a major country banning crypto. Supply and demand issues for specific contracts can lead to spreads widening or shrinking in one or more set of futures contracts compared to others.  Other changes in price include what’s known as “gaps.” These refer to periods of time on price charts where no trading is taking place – so there's no pricing data for those time gaps. They are only present on traditional platforms like CME because they have specific trading hours, unlike the wider crypto market that trades 24/7.  If a cryptocurrency’s price jumps significantly during the traditional market closing hours, large gaps can appear in the asset’s price chart on a traditional platform when the market reopens the following day.  Where can I trade bitcoin and crypto futures?  Over the last five years, the popularity of crypto-based futures products has grown exponentially, and now there is now a wide range of traditional and crypto-native platforms where you can begin trading crypto futures.  Leading examples of platforms that provide this type of trading include:  FTX  CME  eToro  BitMEX  TD Ameritrade  Kraken  Bakkt  Deribit  Bybit  What’s the difference between futures contracts and perpetual swap contracts?  If you’ve been in the crypto industry for any length of time, you may have come across the term “perpetual swap contract.”  Perpetual swaps, or “perps,” operate in a very similar fashion to futures contracts in that they allow investors to purchase or sell an underlying asset at a future date, but with one key difference – perpetual swap contracts have no expiration date.  This means a trader can keep their contract to buy or sell open as long as they want – provided they keep up with margin payments – until they’re ready to settle them or sell them on to another trader.  Read more: What Is a Perpetual Swap Contract?  Because these types of trading contracts have no expiration date, they require a special mechanism to ensure the contract price tracks the spot price (current market price) as close as it can. This system is known as a “perpetual swap funding rate” and essentially involves long (buyers) or short (sellers) traders paying the opposite party a periodic fee, depending on whether the contract’s price is above or below the market price.  If the market price is lower than the perp futures price, long traders will be required to pay a fee to short traders to discourage more traders going long. Conversely, if the market price is higher than the perps futures price, short traders will pay a fee to long traders.  Perp funding rates can often be a useful metric for gauging market sentiment around a particular asset.  Risks of crypto futures trading  Despite the many benefits of trading futures versus spot trading (buying and selling with immediate delivery of assets), such as indirect exposure and trading with leveraged to boost potential gains, there are also a number of serious risks associated with it that new investors need to be mindful of. These are predominantly margin calls and liquidation.  As previously mentioned, trading with leverage involves borrowing funds from a third party, usually the exchange you’re trading with, to increase your trade size.  Naturally, an exchange won’t let you borrow funds without putting up some sort of insurance in case the trade goes against you. This insurance pot is known as an “initial margin” that a trader has to set aside before they can open a leveraged trade. Just as your potential gains are turbocharged from using leverage, so are your losses.  But before we get into that, it’s important to understand three key parts of a futures trade:  Margin account: This is where the initial margin is kept (the minimum amount of collateral required to open a futures trade).  Margin calls: A margin call refers to when an exchange notifies a user that the capital in their margin account is getting low.  Maintenance margin: This is the amount of funds a user must have ready to deposit into their margin account if their initial margin runs out. Think of it as a backup fund.  In the event the market goes against a trader and their respective margin account is depleted, they incur something known as “liquidation” – meaning your position will be automatically closed by the exchange and your initial margin taken.  Read more: What Does Liquidation Mean and How to Avoid it?  To find out how much the market has to move against you before you’re liquidated, the general formula is: Liquidation % = 100/leverage. So, for example, if you are leveraged 50x, the market only needs to move against you by 2% to liquidate your position (100/50 = 2). In the highly volatile crypto space, that means you run an incredibly high risk of being liquidated and losing your invested capital.  Of course, investors can always top up their initial margins to keep their positions open for longer in the hope the market moves the other way, but, again, this adds additional capital risk.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/crypto-futures-trading-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27571fbf5f03f075921bfd79a30ba2ffe15ea887-2123x1412.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sunak was chosen by his fellow Conservative Party members on Monday to replace Truss – who was in office for just 45 days and was forced to resign after her economic stimulus plan quickly unraveled, leading to political and economic instability.  During his time as finance minister under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sunak announced he wanted to turn the U.K. into a crypto hub. He helped usher in the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which, if passed into law, could give local regulators broad power over the crypto industry – starting with bringing asset-pegged crypto like stablecoins into the scope of payments regulations. Under his leadership, the country's coin producer, the Royal Mint, was tasked with creating a non-fungible token (NFT) collection, which has yet to come to fruition.  Truss’ government had expressed a commitment to Sunak’s crypto plans but her resignation threatened to shake things up once again. The local crypto industry, which had been in communication with Sunak over crypto policy during his tenure as finance minister, stands to welcome his appointment as the leader of the government.  Following the announcement of Sunak's appointment, Adam Jackson, director of policy at Innovate Finance, a U.K. tech industry body that also advocates for crypto, called the former finance minister a ""champion of fintech.""

The Fireblocks Payments Engine is intended to allow the company’s clients to process digital payments more quickly and securely, offering merchants immediate access to fiat-to-stablecoin conversion for customer payments. By circumventing traditional banking networks, the product would enable users sending funds abroad to convert money from one fiat currency to another in minutes instead of days and for lower fees.  The company said its Payments Engine – which allows clients to make payments in USD coin (USDC), among other cryptos – will reach potential customers globally through Fireblocks’ partnerships with major payment service providers like World Pay and Checkout.com.  To date, Checkout.com has facilitated settlement of more than $1 billion in a beta program of the new service using USDC, according to the statement.  Ran Goldi, vice president and head of payments at Fireblocks, said the payment system’s ability to transport money quickly from point A to Z could transform the way merchants operate their businesses by improving cash flow.  “Merchants can now get paid within a few hours instead of a few days, and that's power to a merchant,” Goldi told CoinDesk. “If you're a business, cash flow is a big deal for you and you want to have as much cash as possible so you could buy more inventory, pay more suppliers [and] pay your employees.”  Goldi says Fireblocks’ goal in launching the tool suite is to arm payment service providers with the infrastructure upon which they can build their crypto payment products. Although the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment for everyday goods is still in its early stages, Goldi said it is important for Fireblocks to lay the groundwork now for what he expects will soon be much wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.  “People won’t start paying with [crypto] in the U.S. tomorrow morning because we have Apple Pay and Google Pay,” said Goldi. “But I'm 100% certain that over the next five to 10 years, the technology stack of everything that's finance will digitize currencies, and then they will need this infrastructure that we've created to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.”  Fireblocks’ further push into the crypto payments market comes on the heels of the company’s acquisition of payments technology firm First Digital earlier this year. Following the purchase, Fireblocks has focused on exploring crypto use cases designed to resolve cross-border payment issues and other transnational money transfer problems.

Here’s What the Data Says,"The global and ceaseless nature of cryptocurrency trading poses a number of challenges for traders, one of which is finding the best time to trade.  Those looking to execute large buy and sell orders will need to identify times when there’s maximum liquidity (availability of counterparties at any given time for you to exit or enter a trade) and trading volume (how many times a coin changes hands at a given time). That's just like a grocer with vast quantities of produce to sell will ideally want to set up his stall at the busiest market with the most visitors.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  For novice traders, or those looking to place smaller trades, liquidity is less of a concern. However, they may still want to trade on more established platforms because prices on those apps tend to be less affected by large orders or manipulation.  Finding the right hours to conduct trades is not just a challenge for spot traders (people who buy and sell with immediate delivery of assets,), but also for investors in decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens.  Blockchain transaction fees, such as Ethereum gas fees, can change dramatically from one hour to the next, and so it’s especially important for beginners with small portfolios to pay attention to those prices because gas fees are responsive to network congestion rather than to the size of a trade.  For example, someone looking to trade $100 worth of cryptocurrency may end up paying twice that amount in gas fees if he plans to execute the trade at a busy time.  CoinDesk asked crypto metrics firms, market analysts and professional traders to help illuminate the mysteries around crypto trading and why time matters.  Continental shift  Crypto trading had fairly straightforward patterns before its mainstream adoption began in earnest in mid-2020. Western institutions avoided crypto at all costs, and trading, along with other crypto activities like mining, was concentrated in Asia.  Until 2021, the Asian impact was so significant that bitcoin bulls would fear the Chinese New Year in February when miners would dump bitcoin en masse and send prices tumbling.  But those patterns changed.  “During the 2017 rally, the sunrise in Japan was a big deal for bitcoin prices,” Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of investment advisory group Quantum Economics, said. “Now that Wall Street is more intimately involved, a lot of the action has shifted west.  “These days the early Asian session is so thin that we suspect some traders may be using it to manipulate the price,” he added.  There’s ample data to suggest that crypto trading activity coincides with traditional market hours in the U.S., illustrating that crypto investment largely shifted from the East to the West.  ""Bitcoin spot volume tends to peak during U.S. stock market hours, especially at the opening bell,” William Johnson, an analyst at crypto analytics firm Coin Metrics, said.  According to a Coin Metrics chart shared with CoinDesk, the correlation with the U.S. trading hours was most pronounced in the first quarter of 2022, suggesting a clear evolving trend.  “Never trust the weekends”  Crypto doesn’t rest on weekends, but the U.S. equity traders are asleep. So what to make of the weekend trading activity?  “Simply put, the weekends have a drop-off in participation by smarter money,” Cantering Clark, a pseudonymous crypto trader and market analyst, said, referring to capital controlled by institutions and professional traders. He explained that there’s a high volume of activity by algorithmic trading bots and market makers (or liquidity providers) during weekends. “The market is less compelling to trade,” he said.  According to a ""realized volatility"" chart from Genesis Volatility, there's less volatility on weekends. Generally, traders seek volatility because it opens up opportunities for lucrative trades.  “Weekends in legacy markets such as forex were always known to be thinner. Knowing this, banks would push the market around to force movements. The same thing can be seen in crypto, so for the longest time the idea was that any weekend activity was ‘wrong’ and worth fading,” Clark said.  If bitcoin rises on a weekend, the expectation among traders is often that the market would move down over the week, Clark explained. “‘Never trust the weekend’ is a good thing to remind yourself.”  Best time for trading DeFi tokens  There’s a great deal of trading activity in DeFi, where traders can tinker with tokens that haven’t been listed by centralized exchanges. But when’s the best time to trade on DeFi, particularly Ethereum?  Transactions on Ethereum cost gas fees, which go up or down in price depending on network use. So that can be a significant factor in optimizing the trade time for traders with smaller portfolios.     In April, 2022, Connor Higgins, a data scientist at Flipside Crypto, told CoinDesk, “If we break down fees by the hour we can see fewer but larger transactions around midnight ET, and more activity around 5 p.m. ET, which used to be the most expensive time to transact.”  “It looks like people have been trying to be clever and transact less around the most active hours of the day. But that just made the less active hours more active and therefore more expensive,” Higgins said, sharing the chart below.     As of October, 2022, a heatmap from Anyblock Analytics shows there's still a dip in transactions and therefore gas fees on weekends and that the most expensive time is when the U.S. wakes up to trade. This can be seen below as things start to get darker red (more expensive) around 13:00 UTC, which is 9 a.m. in New York.     So if you're looking to save on gas fees and your trade isn't time-sensitive, waiting to complete the transaction outside of the hours when the U.S. markets are open is smart.  Centralized and decentralized exchange activity  Because Ethereum runs on a public blockchain, data analytics firms are able to label wallets and track their activities. That also allows them to observe Ethereum-related activity across many centralized exchanges.  According to a top 20 gas spender chart from Nansen, a blockchain analytics firm, trading activity starts to ramp up on both Coinbase and Binance, the two largest centralized exchanges in the world, during the morning hours in the U.S. and peaks at the typical close of business, or early evening.  Yet Nansen’s data journalist Martin Lee pointed out there’s a mirroring trend on the top 20 gas consumer chart that tracks smart contracts in DeFi. Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange, shows similar time patterns as centralized exchanges.  Although centralized and decentralized exchanges have radically different features (e.g., open order book system versus automated marker makers), they appear to converge around the same time pattern as U.S. trading hours rule them all.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/is-there-a-best-time-to-trade-crypto-heres-what-the-data-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3c21a358a372a514ac0787949e6d9b75cfbdc8c-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dalbar, an independent investment research firm, has found in its decades-long study series that average investors significantly underperform the market, and they would be better off just putting their money into the S&P 500 stock index.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  It’s easy to get caught up in the frantic world of Crypto Twitter and ticker-scrolling business news and feel you are missing out. At the same time, many people feel so overwhelmed by the myriad of trading tools available that it seems impossible to get started.  CoinDesk asked three professionals to recommend their most reliable indicators that are simple enough for beginner investors to use and that can help them make level-headed decisions fueled by data, not FOMO.  While these tools were recommended to CoinDesk for crypto investors, they can also be applied to trade all sorts of traditional financial assets such as stocks or commodities. All of them are available for anyone free of charge on popular charting platforms such as Tradingview or cryptocurrency-specific websites.  Here are the three ways to use charts and data to improve your buy, sell or hold decisions.  Read more: 4 Tips to Maximize Your Crypto Investment  Linear regression channel  The linear regression channel is a technical indicator that shows the trend channel within which the price of an asset fluctuates. You can find this indicator on charting sites and platforms such as TradingView, which we’ll use for this example.  The linear regression channel consists of three lines: an upper bound, lower bound and median trend line in the middle.  The median line is a straight line that best fits the last 100 price points. The lower bound provides a support from where the price usually bounces up. The upper bound acts as a point of resistance that the price has a hard time breaking through to rise above.  When the price touches the lower bound, it’s a buy signal. Whereas when the price reaches the upper bound, expect a correction, which is an opportunity to sell.  Howard Greenberg, cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy, said the linear regression channel is best for so-called swing trades, which aim to profit off price swings over a period of days or weeks.  If someone is looking for a short-term trade, the time frame of the chart should be set hourly. For longer trades, daily or even a weekly chart should do the work.  “I am usually using the one-hour or four-hour chart for swing trades, but the indicator works well on all time frames from my experience,” Greenberg said.  “When looking to enter a trade I am looking for one of two things, either a coin trading at the bottom of the linear regression, as we see the candles tend to return towards the median line, or I will enter a trade after confirming a break through that median line, as we often see dramatic moves through that median line area towards the top line on the overlay.”  “Similarly, I will look to exit my position if we fail to break through the median line and begin to retrace or will wait until we start approaching the top line for exit as again we tend to see price movement get pulled back towards the median line,” he added.  Fear and Greed Index  The Fear and Greed Index works as a thermometer that measures the sentiment in the market.  It generates a single number between 1 and 100. When the score is lower the market is in a state of fear, meaning people are selling causing prices to drop. On the other end of the spectrum, when scores are high it means people are greedily buying, driving prices higher.  Read more: The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, Explained  “It’s such a great tool for people who want to keep track of market sentiment and volatility without having to try to interpret so much information on their own when making buying and selling decisions,” Erika Rasure, founder of financial education firm Crypto Goddess, said.  “In terms of trading, it helps us understand when is a good time to buy (when the index is lower in the direction of fear) and when to sell (when the index is higher in the direction of greed),” Rasure said.  “When the score is low, it generally indicates that prices will eventually begin to trend up. When it’s high, it’s a signal that the overall market is prime for a correction. When used together with other indicators, it becomes more powerful and insightful.”  Simple and exponential moving averages  Moving averages are calculated from an asset’s past prices for a certain period of time. The most-used timeframes are 50-day, 100-day and 200-day, though moving averages can also be calculated in weeks.  The purpose of using moving averages is to show a general trend over time by smoothing out the short-term fluctuations in price.  To put it simply, if an asset’s price is above its moving average, it is in an uptrend and the moving average provides support for the price to bounce off.  If the price is below the moving average, it’s in a downward trend and the moving average behaves as resistance.  Brett Sifling, investment advisor at wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki, said he prefers to use the longer-term 200-day moving average, combined with a shorter-term 50-day moving average. “I like to accumulate investments on support levels of the long-term moving averages during an uptrend,” Sifling said.  The combination of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages “can highlight shorter- and longer-term trends, which many people call a golden cross or death cross,” according to Sifling.  Read more: The Dreaded Death Cross and Shining Golden Cross  There are two types of moving averages: simple and exponential. The difference between them is while the simple moving average (SMA) takes past prices into account with an equal weight, the exponential moving average (EMA) puts more weight on recent prices.  “I also find it helpful to use an exponential moving average for the shorter-term signal (50-day), as it has a more sensitive signal during times of volatility,” Sifling said.  Don’t forget risk with trading indicators  Technical analysis and trading tools are like the weather forecast. They can help you anticipate what will happen with prices on the markets and prepare accordingly, but the future isn’t set in stone. Unforeseeable events can throw predictions off the rails anytime.  These indicators above can help you make more informed investment decisions, but it’s always smart to remember the risks so you don’t bet the family farm based on one indicator.

42394191,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY49z,1666615607,Outsmart Yourself: Become a Better Crypto Trader by Avoiding the Top Cognitive Biases,"Your brain can be your worst enemy in trading.  You like to think you’re rational and objective about every decision, but that isn’t true. Here’s the problem: Your attention is limited in an increasingly complex world.  The DeFi Edge is the writer of “The DeFi Edge” newsletter focused on the latest trends and narratives in crypto. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Trading Week.""  The brain’s lazy. It likes to conserve energy and find shortcuts whenever possible. And, sometimes, that leads to oversimplifying information to the point where it’s wrong.This leads to cognitive biases. Cognitive biases are judgments we form based on our experiences and beliefs rather than objective evidence. These biases can lead us to make bad decisions, especially when trading in financial markets.  To become a better trader, you have to think more logically. Understanding what cognitive biases are and overcoming them is one of the easiest ways to improve your performance. There are hundreds of cognitive biases out there. Where should you begin?Let’s start with the four biggest ones that affect every crypto trader at some point.  Read More: 15 Ways to Stay Sane While Trading Crypto  1. The action bias  The action bias describes our preference for taking action over inaction. It’s the feeling that you always have to do something.  I used to play a lot of poker. One common leak is the feeling that you must play every single hand. Maybe it’s boredom or people want the dopamine hits. Sometimes the best thing to do is to wait until you have a better starting hand.  That’s how I feel now about the bear market. It’s a more challenging market to trade in, and it can sometimes feel like player vs. player. Instead of trying to trade with so many headwinds against you, try waiting. You might be better off leveling up your skills and waiting for a better macro environment.  2. The anchor bias  The anchor bias describes how you over-rely on the first piece of information you see. All decisions are silently “anchored” to the first point. This is a commonly used strategy in the world of fashion. The shirt starts off at $100, a few months later it goes on “sale” for $50.  It feels like you’re getting a good deal because you’re comparing it to the $100 price tag. Would you feel like you were getting a good deal if you knew the shirt cost $5 to make?  The anchor bias occurs in crypto all the time.  You heard about bitcoin at $1,000 and didn’t invest. It goes up to $5,000. You don’t want to buy anymore because it’s too expensive, in your mind. But that’s because you’ve anchored it to $1,000. What if you believe it’ll go up to $100,000 one day?  A token peaked at $200 a coin. Now it’s at $15. Your gut instinct says it’s a good deal. But all that’s in the past. How does its road map look now? What developments has it had since the peak price?  Evaluate it based on its potential rather than its past.  Read More: 9 Survival Tips for Crypto Winter  3. Confirmation bias  We all want to be right. Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek out information that agrees with it. You keep reinforcing what you already believe. This is the most dangerous bias of all.  Let’s say you’re interested in buying a token. You want to believe it’ll do 100x, right?  You only follow people who say good things about a specific token.  When negative data appears about that token, you blame that on FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt).  You’ve locked yourself into an echo chamber.  4. The sunk cost bias  When people spend a lot of effort on something (including money), they won’t back down even if it goes wrong. We tend to overcommit because we’re scared of losing the original investment and selling it is kinda admitting that you were wrong. Don’t throw good money after the bad. If you’re down 70% on a token, you still have 30% left. It might be worth salvaging the last 30% instead of seeing it go down further.  Just because you spent time or money doing something doesn’t mean you should keep doing it. Ask yourself: “Knowing what I know now, would I make the same decision again?”  Read More: Aaron Lammer’s Advice for Making It in Crypto: Just Do Something  How can you stop cognitive biases?  To avoid letting these biases impact your trading decisions, you must be aware of them and consciously try to counter them. Study the biases. There are hundreds of biases out there. Start by studying the works of Daniel Kahneman.  Reflect: Think about some of the mistakes you’ve made in crypto. How many of them were caused by cognitive biases?  Create a checklist: Whenever you make an investment decision, you go through it. It’ll keep you aware of thinking flaws.  Develop systems: Systems are a set of processes and decision-making criteria. For example, determining when you’ll cut losses or take profits before you enter the trade. Once you’re in the trenches, it’s easy to become emotional.  Remember that no matter how diligent you are with recognizing and combating cognitive bias, you cannot be immune from its influence altogether. Everyone makes mistakes, so don’t beat yourself up if something goes wrong in your trading career. Focus instead on learning from it and moving forward.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,The DeFi Edge,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/24/crypto-trading-cognitive-bias-examples,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38007cfd110f3e71dbe779cd275a3bb3af4f38fb-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Establishing the platform is one of four goals outlined in the document, which lays out the institution's road map for the next five years. The TASE is looking to ""promote the implementation of innovative technologies"" and will explore the use of distributed ledgers (DLT) for immutable record-keeping, tokenization and smart contracts (which can be used to execute crypto trades) to improve existing markets infrastructure, and offer digital asset ""services and products.""  ""We see in the next five years a critical window of opportunity for the integration of the Israeli Stock Exchange in the technological revolution that the world's capital markets are going through,"" CEO Itai Ben-Zeev said in the document.  Jurisdictions around the world are warming to the idea of incorporating elements of the technologies that underpin crypto markets into existing markets infrastructure. For instance, the European Union has approved a pilot to test the use of DLT for settling trades directly instead of through intermediaries.  Israeli regulators and lawmakers, meantime, have also indicated an interest in encouraging regulated crypto activity in the country. Earlier this year, the country's capital markets regulator handed out its first licenses for crypto service providers, and TASE is working with the Ministry of Finance to issue a blockchain-based digital state bond.  The inclusion of crypto in TASE's strategy is a ""stamp of approval"" for crypto and shows the technology that powers digital assets can improve the traditional financial services sector according to Ben Samocha, industry advocate and founder of Israeli crypto media outlet CryptoJungle.  ""The inefficiencies of our current systems must be fixed with transparency, digitalization and faster settlements.

42394187,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY3pT,1666613663,A Compass Through Crypto Turbulence: Understanding Web3's Demand-Side Tokenization Models,"As recently as nine months ago, Helium was celebrated as a groundbreaking Web3 application with the potential for widespread use and glowing write-ups in major media outlets. Adoption of the global network of “hotspots that create public, long-range wireless coverage for Internet of Things (IoT) devices” skyrocketed. Approximately half a million miners joined between 2021 and 2022. The price of its native token, HNT, increased 2825% year over year from Jan. 1, 2021 to Jan. 1, 2022.  Just a few months later, the token price crashed back to Earth. Miners have slowed down investment, complaining of insufficient (or negative) return on investment.  Stephanie Hurder is a founding economist at Prysm Group and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. Prysm Group Associate Kajol Char contributed to this article. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Trading Week.""  Part of the blame surely lies with the ongoing crypto winter, and also a scathing expose published by Forbes with accusations of insider dealing by the founding team. But the fundamental value drivers of the token also contributed to this downturn. In order to weather this storm, Helium will need to avoid a common token economics trap: focusing only on the quantitative elements of token supply without the same rigorous modeling of token demand.  How to think about token demand  In talking to hundreds of crypto projects, we find that projects tend to focus on the same questions:  How many tokens should we mint?  How many tokens should we release at launch?  What number of tokens should be given as rewards to stakeholders over time?  These are all important, but they only address the supply side of the equation. Providing a user a reward of 100 dogecoin (current value $5.89) is surely less attractive to them than one bitcoin (current value $19,130.30), even though the former provides 100 times as many tokens as the latter. The demand for the token – and the resulting equilibrium value – is an essential ingredient in determining how many tokens a project should plan to issue and when.  Demand drivers for a token take a variety of forms. But they all involve answering the following question: Why (besides speculative returns) would someone pay fiat money in exchange for this token? While demand drivers constantly evolve with the industry, they tend to fall into a few categories:  Means of payment: Users require tokens to purchase platform goods and services, such as storage or computational capacity.  Staking: Users are required to stake tokens to earn rewards and/or to allow users to contribute resources to a platform.  Access: Users require tokens to access exclusive services, such as social clubs or programs.  Security: Token holdings grant a claim on an asset or actual ownership of it.  Governance: Holding tokens allows users to participate in platform governance processes and take actions such as submitting proposals for upgrades or votes.  A single token can have multiple demand drivers that, jointly moderated by supply, determine the equilibrium value. The Wharton online program Economics of Blockchain and Digital Assets we contributed to discusses methods for building token demand scenarios and assessing equilibrium token value.  See also: A Day in the Life of a Crypto Trader  The benefits of modeling demand  In the long term, as crypto markets mature, we anticipate that supply and demand-based valuation will become a requirement for token projects, the same way discounted cash flow (DCF) models form a basis for equity valuations today. But even in the short term, building a quantitative demand model can have numerous benefits for a project team.  Benefit #1: Providing a quantitative check on token use cases  Building a quantitative demand model for a token forces a team to understand the limits of its customer base and token adoption drivers. Suppose a token is meant to purchase goods and services. What share of target markets can the project reasonably expect to capture? What is the expected value of those purchases? How will it evolve over time?  In many cases, these quantitative estimates provide a disappointingly small number. This forces the team to revisit the fundamental uses of the token. They may need to address how to be more attractive to organic users, or to add additional demand drivers to the token.  Benefit #2: Avoiding excessive price inflation or deflation  Even if a token has robust demand projections, achieving the desired equilibrium token properties requires a careful engineering of supply and demand. If the demand for a token outstrips the available supply, tokens become scarce and the price can spike upward, causing hoarding. If there is too little demand compared to issuance, a potential deflationary spiral looms.  Using demand scenarios, projects can pressure test supply specifications such as airdrops, rewards pools and vesting periods to minimize the probability of unattractive price swings due to poorly managed supply.  Importantly, this is true not only pre-launch but also after launch when information regarding demand is realized. Projects can use updated demand models to make adjustments to releases and vesting schedules (where possible) to keep the token economics within desired ranges.  Benefit #3: Achieving target ROI for critical stakeholders  Stakers, validators and investors may be expecting a specific annual percentage yield (APY) range when contributing capital to a project. Teams can use demand projections along with distribution schedules to estimate whether these target return on investment (ROI) ranges will be achieved.  This is particularly important to consider in the early stage of a product launch, where projects may have a lot of hype but not a lot of organic usage. Founding teams frequently want to distribute a large number of tokens to provide increased incentives for ecosystem development and bootstrapping, but this can instead result in hyperinflation and lower returns than would otherwise have been achieved.  Benefit #4: Pressure testing a hard cap  It is no secret that many investors love a hard cap, and more than half of the 100 largest tokens by market cap have one. A common risk when selecting a hard cap is that the project will eventually run out of tokens as the need for rewards outstrips supply. Understanding the number of tokens required to achieve various incentive and reserve goals allows projects to make sure the hard cap is sufficiently large to support platform growth.  How Helium benefits from delving into demand  Helium employs a complex mint-and-burn token economy that includes elements of means-of-payment, staking and occasionally governance-driven demand. Investing in building a full model of supply, demand, and equilibrium value could help Helium navigate, and possibly avoid altogether, current and future crises.  First, having a quantitative projection of critical demand drivers would have allowed Helium to better calibrate its supply parameters during its bootstrapping period. Helium’s issuance curve of token rewards to infrastructure providers is aggressive, with the token distributions significant up front and halving over time. With token prices initially high, driven by hype, the rewards were more than enough to attract user investment. Users spent $53.3 million purchasing and setting up hotspots from June 2021 to August 2022.  However, the value of these token rewards must eventually be supported by demand for the token, and this is where the Helium design seems to have fallen short. Demand for data transfers, the key demand driver of the HNT token and token burning, has been low and dropping. Demand for data transfers totaled only $92,000 from June 2021 through August 2022, falling 93% from their peak in April through August. In the same period, circulating supply of HNT increased over 25%. This mismatch between demand and supply has depressed the token price and the ROI achieved by miners.  By modeling a robust set of demand scenarios, Helium may have been able to detect early on that their issuance curve was too aggressive, and miner ROI too low, in low-demand situations like the present. And even if Helium’s initial analysis had not considered the sharp peak and drop off in demand that occurred mid-year 2022, they could use a model now to revise their issuance curve. A full demand model would inform not just whether the issuance curve should be updated, but by how much.  Second, Helium will face another significant token economics challenge as it approaches its hard cap. Currently, the hard cap of HNT is set at 223 million tokens. Once newly minted tokens are depleted, miners will be rewarded via a net emissions mechanism, in which “burned” tokens are re-issued in proportion to demand factors. But these emissions are capped at a pre-specified rate. When can Helium expect to approach its hard cap? Is the emissions cap at the right magnitude to support the system long-term? Should the hard cap be adjusted up or down? These are questions a demand-based model can address.  See also: Why Trading Is Essential for Crypto | Opinioin  Finally, Helium users recently voted to migrate from Helium’s own blockchain to Solana. Not only does this have critical security and interoperability implications, but it also eliminates validator staking, a driver of token demand. Token holders surely want to understand the impact of this, in combination with other potential benefits and costs, on their holdings. As shown in our analysis of the Ethereum merge included in the Wharton blockchain course, a full demand-based model can address this scenario.  The cryptocurrency market is unpredictable, and token projects need to be prepared to weather significant challenges. Web3 projects that choose to invest the resources to understand token demand, and not just supply, will have the tools at their disposal to navigate the complexities of the next crypto winter and beyond.",NEUTRAL,HNT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | HNT,Stephanie Hurder,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/24/a-compass-through-crypto-turbulence-understanding-web3s-demand-side-tokenization-models,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6ce34fc807db6ce4cbefbf42945e7bc62d14c5a-6240x4160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413795,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlCFCC,1666613568,Black Thursdays: Bitcoin's 5 Worst Crashes,"Only a few people are old enough to remember what happened on exactly this day almost a century ago. Those who do likely wish they didn’t.  It was Oct. 24, 1929, better known as “Black Thursday,” after a financially booming decade came to an end when Wall Street traders woke up to a stock market that suddenly tumbled 11% from the night before. Larger falls continued for the next two years and eventually the country went into a decade-long economic depression.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  In observance of the occasion – and, oh yeah, it’s Trading Week at CoinDesk – we decided to look back at some spectacular crypto crashes.  June 2011: 'Hey guys, it's Nick.'  If you’re what people would call an ""OG"" cryptocurrency investor, you probably either made the best or worst decision of your life in June 2011.  “Hey guys, it’s Nick. I just witnessed a very dramatic price crash in bitcoin,” a YouTuber with the handle BookofNick told his followers in a video. Bitcoin (BTC), the only cryptocurrency that was circulating back then, had crashed from $17.50 to 1 cent.  “That’s right, people, we’re buying bitcoin at one penny,” Nick said.  The crash occurred when an exchange called Mt. Gox, which in the early years of crypto was handling over 70% of all bitcoin transactions, got hacked. Mt. Gox eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing almost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins.  On other exchanges, bitcoin’s low that year was around $2, and the cryptocurrency ended the year at around just under $5.  December 2013: China FUD  Two years later, more people outside of the narrow crypto spectrum had started paying attention to the latest “internet currency.” The entrepreneur-turned-TV-personality Kevin O’Leary, for example, explained that bitcoin was a safe haven for people who don’t trust any other currency and that it was “here to stay.”  Michael Saylor, then CEO of software vendor MicroStrategy, tweeted on Dec. 13, 2013: “#Bitcoin days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.”  (Yes, this is the same Michael Saylor who’s now one of bitcoin’s biggest evangelists.)  The year 2013 was also when China made its first mark on bitcoin: The Chinese central bank issued a warning against using bitcoin as legal tender. The price of bitcoin dropped over 50%, from a then-all-time high of $1,200 to less than $600.  Edward Moya, a senior analyst at foreign-exchange broker Oanda, says he started hearing about bitcoin in 2014, when it was trading at around that range.  “I was like, it’s basically lost half its value and there’s these people saying it’s going to $100,000 and it’s even going higher because global central banks are being reckless, and this is how I'm taking control of what I own,” he said. “I was stunned.”  The fact that the bitcoin price was constantly crashing just added to the fascination. “Just seeing which type of investors were supporting this movement” kept him interested, he says, even though he wouldn’t buy in just yet.  December 2017: Just before crypto winter  If you look at the current price of bitcoin ($19,592 as of press time) and its price five years ago, some skeptics might argue that no progress has been made.  But back in December 2017, when bitcoin’s value topped $20,000 for the first time, traders were astounded – and many early buyers of the original cryptocurrency were suddenly very rich.  But what goes up must come down. Just 12 days later, the crypto asset crashed to $12,840.  And this time, it wasn’t just bitcoin that was hit by the crash. Other established crypto assets, such as Ethereum’s ether (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash’s BCH, lost value, too.  March 2020: The pandemic shock  It’s hard to forget March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S., a life-altering event in just about every way imaginable.  As a result, the stock market lost 13% on March 16, nicknamed ""Black Monday,"" as the pandemic’s potentially devastating impact on the economy suddenly became undeniable. The growing uncertainty caused a crash in crypto assets, considered among the riskiest assets of all.  Bitcoin fell by 57% to a low of $3,867 after having traded near $10,000 in the previous month. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value after bitcoin, fell 46% that week.  “Since I knew stocks would recover eventually, I kept what I had already accumulated and added to it,” said Bob Iaccino, co-founder and chief market strategist at Path Trading Partners.  In a strange epilogue, the pandemic ultimately helped crypto gain more mainstream attention. Over the next several months, Wall Street banks and investment firms including BlackRock, AllianceBernstein, Morgan Stanley and Tudor Investment started buying billions of dollars' worth of bitcoin. PayPal announced it would allow 346 million customers to hold bitcoin. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime bitcoin naysayer, said that cryptocurrency had ""considerable"" price upside.  Eventually, on Dec. 16, 2020, bitcoin pushed past $20,000, eclipsing the previous all-time-high and reaching $29,374 by the end of 2020. What started as a crash ended in a rally.  May 2022: the Terra meltdown  After a 2021 that was arguably the most successful year for the crypto industry, the reckoning came swiftly.  First came the crash of Terra, a blockchain with its own dollar-linked stablecoin, UST. The UST token was supposed to retain a value of $1, but the price came unpegged – and soon traders also lost confidence in the blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, LUNA, whose price eventually would tumble 99%.  The implosion dragged digital-asset markets lower, including bitcoin’s price. It didn’t help that the U.S. Federal Reserve was rapidly raising interest rates to slow the pace of inflation – putting downward pressure on prices for all assets considered to be risky, from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  Casualties of the rapid market sell-off included Three Arrows Capital, which was once considered one of the savviest crypto hedge funds.  Then, on June 12, Celsius Network, one of the biggest and most successful crypto lenders, informed users that it had frozen their assets due to “extreme market conditions.”  Bitcoin lost nearly 37% in June alone, dropping from $32,000 to below $18,000. Ether dropped 44%.",NEGATIVE,BCH | LUNA,BCH | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/24/black-thursdays-bitcoins-five-worst-crashes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ec8aa297f3b734ff2530570a6ed04f61cb2ea9f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420929,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtvqP,1666613546,How Crypto Traders Are Weathering the Bear Market,"Crypto prices are excruciatingly range-bound. Search interest has bottomed out. Trading volumes and open interest on exchanges has plummeted as demand has evaporated.  Last year’s crypto casino that drew hordes to digital assets has become a ghost house of the discouraged and disenchanted.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Trading Week.  But among the remaining residents are day traders, a small group of steely nerved investors who bank on their ability to read cryptos’ daily price fluctuations to pay their bills. Some garnered well into six-figure incomes. Some became millionaires.  But the current bear market has complicated their jobs. How do you forecast an asset’s future when that asset correlates to wider, macroeconomic conditions that have reached historical levels of uncertainty? What strategies are useful when the asset is new and its market is suffering through a steep down cycle with no clear indication of an endpoint?  Three full-time crypto traders shared their stories with CoinDesk about how they’ve been weathering the current, bitter cold, crypto winter, including their biggest wins and worst bets of the last few months.  Bethany, Cryptogle and Howard Greenberg have adopted different tactics. Bethany has become cautious and analytical about when and in which digital assets she invests. Cryptogle has been holding investments longer and is shorting cryptos for the first time in his decade as a digital asset investor. Howard Greenberg is setting more moderate expectations on how much he expects to profit and is quicker to abandon investments when they start losing money.  Each of them remains committed to trading crypto, which has been lucrative in the past and which they believe will rally again once inflation and the global economy turn for the better.  “This might be a more painful downturn,” Cryptogle said. “But will crypto come back? Of course it will, and rally again.”  Wait and study your losses  Avid crypto and non-fungible token trader Bethany has mostly stayed out of the current market, although she’s collected some bruises by prematurely predicting that crypto markets would recover sooner.  “I have had some big losses thinking that this is the bottom or a relief rally is due soon.”  She found switching from a “bull mindset” to being more flexible in her crypto bets difficult after the months-long price upswing in 2021. “Since we were in this 'up only' mentality for so long it's been hard for me to shift away from that bias.”  She has been trading a lot less lately, part of a shift among investors to more risk-averse posture. “We've been in a bit of a sideways market and the risk-to-reward is not really there for me.”  Now, with more free time, Bethany is preparing for the next bull run. She has been reviewing trading principles and studying the potential impact of the broader, macroeconomic environment on digital assets. She has also been scrutinizing what traditional finance firms – sometimes referred to as TradFi in crypto circles – are doing in the crypto space.  “There's more institutional investment in crypto than ever before and it is happening at a time when a lot of retail has left crypto or reduced their investments in it. So understanding what's going on in TradFi has become really critical in trying to anticipate where crypto is going.”  Also, Bethany has been dedicating more time to research projects with the potential to hit “100x growth” when the next bull cycle kicks off.  Read More: Is There a 'Best' Time to Trade Crypto? Here’s What the Data Says  She predicts the next bull run’s biggest gainers will be tokens with certain utility to its holders. “I'm thinking of play-to-earn (P2E) gaming as well as tokens with profit-sharing models or a collaborative building experience.”  Winner trade: “Longing luna classic (LUNC) at about $0.00018-ish and riding the wave up.”  Biggest flop: “Longing ether (ETH) for the Merge when, macro-wise, there was really no reason to be bullish.”  Bagging profits by flipping charts upside down  The veteran trader, who calls himself Cryptogle on Twitter, has remained active during the crypto rout. Cryptogle, who first dabbled with bitcoin (BTC) in 2012, after trading options and stocks for a decade, has already experienced most of the wild swings in cryptos’ 13-year history and so remains optimistic even in crypto’s most recent darkest hours. “There always are opportunities,” he told CoinDesk. “The last quarter was one of my best.”  This year, he has placed 250 bets a day, on average, including trades made by bots, computer-coded software that executes purchases and sales automatically. Still, this volume is less than his average 800 daily trades in 2021.  Cryptogle has also changed his approach since last year, as he generally holds investments longer. And for the first time in any crypto cycle he is shorting – betting on an asset’s price to drop.  “Hysteria and fear are both easy to trade,” he said. “During the bull market you just throw a dart at the wall and likely you'll hit a big win.”  The same is true for the bear market, when everything is crashing. “Things have been so crap that you could just short the market,” he said. “But you gotta make sure you've got the capital available to cover.”  He is an advocate of flipping charts upside down, a trick some traders do to eliminate any bias when predicting prices. “That makes it easier to understand how to play these games and press the sell button instead of the buy button.”  During the bear market, he prefers making long-term investments in crypto infrastructure that might benefit from a new wave of users when better times come for the crypto market.  Winner trade: “Buying CAKE (decentralized exchange PancakeSwap’s token) before [its] initial farm offerings (IFO), and selling immediately when the IFO was released to the public. It was predictably very profitable as a long and a short for a few months.”  Biggest flop: “Doubling down on MAGIC (Treasure DAO’s token) a couple of months ago. “If I had thought twice I would have realized it had more downward pressure than upward at the time.”  Accept smaller wins and limit the losses  Howard Greenberg is a cryptocurrency trading educator at Chicago-based Prosper Trading Academy, a firm that teaches prospective traders about all types of markets, including crypto.  Greenberg saw a substantial drop in interest and commitment to trade digital assets from last year, adding, “Without a doubt, there was much more interest in trading during the bull run.”  He still has over 1,200 traders subscribing to his signals in his dedicated Prosper trading room, but the number of people who now trade with him has declined.  “Traders come in and out during the bear market, taking days or even weeks off,” he said. This contrasts starkly from last year “when everyone was in for every minute.”  He trades crypto on a daily basis and is making a similar number of bets as last year, but with extra caution. He sets smaller profit targets for winning trades and tighter stop-losses, if the price moves in the opposite direction to his prediction.  Greenberg’s survival tip for the bear market: “Be willing to make smaller wins and limit losses.”  Winner trade: Buying BTC with three times leverage leading up to the July 27 Federal Reserve meeting in anticipation of a short squeeze, together with his trader class. ”We were able to ride that from $21,500 to $23,460 in less than 10 hours. We hit our first profit target within one hour,” he said.  Biggest flop: Planned to short ETH as a “sell the news” event going into the Merge, but he got tricked by the huge amount of short open interest in the futures market that could lead to an epic short squeeze and went long. “The only thing that squeezed was my wallet,” he said.

Cosmos released a white paper last month that proposed major expansions to the utility of the Cosmos Hub – the blockchain that sits at the center of the ecosystem.  Read more: New Cosmos White Paper Revamps Cosmos Hub, ATOM Token  “Despite its potentially critical role in a multichain future, very little of the revenues generated by the growing ecosystem of Cosmos appchains have historically accrued to holders of the native token, ATOM,” analysts Brian Cubellis and David Duong wrote. An appchain is a blockchain dedicated to running a single application.  The proposals aim to allow the Cosmos Hub to become a “credibly neutral provider of security,” the note said, while also further aligning the incentives between appchains and ATOM holders, the Cosmos’ native token.  “In this way they are trying to increase the likelihood that ATOM will generate a monetary premium,” the note added.  The white paper is ambitious, the report said. While some parts such as liquid staking, an on-chain market for MEV – or maximal extractable value, and a system for the coordinated deployment of capital to help grow the ecosystem are innovative improvements that may catalyze future adoption are clear, the advantages of the updated ATOM monetary policy are not as obvious.  Coinbase says it remains wary of the suggested changes to the monetary policy and questions whether potential benefits from the future capital deployment of the Cosmos Hub Treasury justify the risk of dilution for token holders in the near-term.

Justice Lee Seiu Kin ruled Friday that NFTs meet certain legal requirements to be considered property, such as being distinguishable from other similar assets and having an owner who can be recognized by third parties.  The judge issued this ruling as an explanation for the injunction he granted in May preventing any potential sale of a Bored Ape NFT. The Bored Ape Yacht Club is a collection of 10,000 cartoon monkeys that have often fetched prices in the realms of $150,000.  The claimant in the case used the NFT as collateral to borrow crypto from another party known by the pseudonym ""chefpierre,"" something he had done multiple times before with other lenders. However, in the midst of discussing refinancing their loan, ""chefpierre"" threatened to exercise the foreclose option on the NFT unless the loan was paid back in full, which the claimant was unable to do.  The judge's decision may prove a watershed moment for NFTs should investors and traders be more confident that their status as property is recognized in law.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices  ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 955.71 +1.63%  ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,625 +2.23%  ● Ether (ETH): $1,365 +3.89%  Insights: Can state regulators exert authority over projects without direct ties to the U.S.?  Gambling-theme NFT project Slotie, based in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, has renewed proliferating concerns about U.S. states extending their securities law into foreign jurisdictions.  Prices  The Week Begins With a Rebound  By Sam Reynolds and James Rubin  Bitcoin spent the weekend in a familiar place, hovering comfortably over $19,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at $19,625, up 2.23% over the last 24 hours and toward the bottom of the narrow range it has occupied for much of the last five weeks. Ether was recently trading at $1,365, up 3.89% from 24 hours earlier and about where it has stood for weeks. Investors remain nervous about inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty that threatens to cast the global economy into a steep recession.  It's generally green across the board as Asia's trading week begins with major altcoins and exchange tokens in the green over the last 24 hours.  Meme coins and metaverse majors were the outliers, with Terra's LUNA down 1.1% and dogecoin knockoff SHIB down 0.5%. Decentraland's MANA token opened the week down 0.9% as the platform struggles with a userbase that's not proportional to its market cap.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently rose 0.6%.  Equity markets closed last week with a rare upswing, with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 rising 2.3%, respectively on Friday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) climbing 2.4% amid better-than-expected third-quarter earnings from a number of global brands, and despite a declining yen and ongoing political turmoil in the U.K.  Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, ticked up slightly to trade over $93 per barrel, up more than 15% from the start of the year. Safe-haven gold climbed 1.6% to trade at $1,654 per ounce.  The U.S. Federal Reserve's next rate hike – a widely expected 75 basis points – is still two weeks away. But on Tuesday, the Conference Board will release October's consumer confidence index – showing a likely decline. The University of Michigan's sentiment index, a measure of attitudes about the U.S. economy, arrives on Friday. During the middle of the week, investors will be able to scrutinize housing starts and durable goods orders.  This rebound will face a test this week as nearly one-third of listed companies in the S&P 500 will announce earnings. If the U.S. really is at the beginning of a recession, missed earnings will be an early warning sign, and knock the wind out of this rebound.

But can Texas securities law rule the world? Or can other U.S. states reach long arms into foreign jurisdictions?  Officials from securities regulators in Alabama, Kentucky, New Jersey and Texas are targeting the gambling-themed non-fungible token project Slotie, with accusations that it illegally sold tokens to raise capital.  Slotie is registered in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.  While there are a number of successful online crypto casinos with active player bases, NFT casino projects — which promise a cut of gambling revenue — have so far not really gone anywhere. The Sands Vegas Casino Club pivoted from being a metaverse-style 3D casino to a more traditional online betting operation, using existing online casino infrastructure on the backend.  But this is crypto. Scams and misrepresentations abound. Do your own research.  What’s more concerning is how state regulators are following in the footsteps of the federal government and doing a supranational flex to exert authority over projects that have no material ties to the U.S.  These projects do not actively solicit U.S. residents. Nor are they based in the country, and their staff are foreign nationals. Terraform Labs will be making similar arguments in its court battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that prior case law found in Royalty Network Inc. v. Dishant.com means there wasn’t “purposeful availment” of the U.S. market just because the webpage was available there and the content is in English.  (This is separate from Terraform’s case, which it lost, against the SEC that service of Do Kwon, while he was in New York, was valid.)  You can’t say supranational or extraterritorial authority of U.S. regulators without mentioning BitMEX. The exchange, run by Arthur Hayes, a loquacious executive who liked to taunt authority, was charged in 2020 with facilitating unregistered trading, and its top brass was separately charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act.  Neither the exchange nor its people had a presence in the U.S. The exchange didn’t deal with fiat currency, only bitcoin (it now takes stablecoins). No bank accounts to be examined for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.  Eventually, none of this was tested in court because BitMEX settled the case, and Hayes pleaded guilty. The ability for American regulators to enforce their laws globally was never examined.  So if the feds have shaky authority that’s yet to be properly examined over regulating international crypto projects, how is it that the states think they can do the same? Everyone knows subnational units like a state or a province generally don’t get involved in international affairs, as it's without question the domain of the federal government.  In previous orders, the Texas state securities board has said that metaverse casinos, like the Flamingo Casino Club, are soliciting residents of the U.S. But there’s no specific language on any of these platform’s sites targeting Texans or Americans in general. It’s also not clear that U.S. residents, or even residents of the prosecuting states, make up the majority of the purchasers of these NFTs.  There may be a case to be made for allegations of fraud and deceit, but why is it that state regulators think they have the authority to make it?
