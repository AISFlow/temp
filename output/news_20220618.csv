The &apos;percent supply in loss&apos; is an indicator that measures what part of the total Bitcoin supply is currently in the red. The metric works by checking the transfer history of each coin on the chain to see what price it was last moved at.

42374605,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw0yIh,1655577421,Crypto Market Tumbles as Bitcoin Breaks Previous Cycle's Highs,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the $18,500 price level for the first time Saturday, failing to rebound back to the $20,000 to $23,000 range it had been steadily trading at last week.  As of press time, bitcoin was trading at about $18,319 a coin, a 10.8% decline over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s market capitalization slumped to about $350 billion, a 73% decline from its November all-time high, according to CoinGecko.  The price drop of bitcoin also marks the breach of a significant price level – namely, bitcoin’s all-time high from the previous crypto cycle.  Bitcoin has historically experienced periods of asymptotic price run-ups followed by steep crashes, typically played out over several months to two years. Cryptocurrency traders and speculators refer to these periods as ""cycles"" and often reference historical price levels when setting new price targets.  Some crypto traders have theorized that bitcoin would not fall below its previous cycle’s highs, a theory that held during the 2018 drawdown, but has now been disproven for the current cycle.  During bitcoin’s 2017 run up, bitcoin reached a then-high of $19,783 in December 2017 before falling back down to the four-digits range just one month later.  During the 2013-2014 cycle, bitcoin reached an all-time high of $1,127 at the time, a level that the cryptocurrency successfully defended during its 2018 drawdown.  Bitcoin’s price drop Saturday morning also brought down the broader crypto currency market, with Ether tumbling 12.4% to $948, well below its 2017-2018 cycle highs of $1,448.  Other major cryptocurrencies saw declines of a smaller magnitude, with Solana’s SOL dropping 8.6% to $29.08, Cardano’s ADA falling 9.1% to 44 cents and XRP declining 6.1% to 30 cents over the past 24 hours.",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC | SOL,ADA | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/18/crypto-market-tumbles-as-bitcoin-breaks-previous-cycles-highs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/587ea988ccd957838702ca6ff83a705255c0a35f-834x859.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Why it matters  The market is taking a downturn but legal activity, not so much. There's a lot happening that may shape guidance and laws that crypto entities have to follow in years to come.  Breaking it down  We brought 20,000 people to Austin, Texas, and all I got was a lousy tan line.  JK. Consensus happened! We had 20,000 attendees, 500+ speakers, 27 stages(?) and a bajillion meetings. And, as is tradition, I wrote two stories in bars at night. Only one had an embarrassing typo! It’s pretty surreal to think that the most chaotic Consensus was 2018, which was widely seen as the most popular for years afterward. We had somewhere between 8,000 and 10,000 people I believe.  So anyways, it was a pretty busy few weeks. I apparently missed a lot between Consensus and Davos. A quick rundown follows.  PoolTogether, a decentralized finance (DeFi) startup facing a lawsuit for allegedly violating New York gambling laws, is selling non-fungible tokens (NFT) for its legal fund.  Nate Chastain, the former OpenSea staffer who quit last year after it came to light he may have bought NFTs from collections prior to his company listing them, now faces federal wire fraud and money laundering charges. I believe this is a first.  ForUsAll, a 401(k) provider in California, sued the U.S. Department of Labor on allegations of violating the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) when it issued guidance telling providers to “exercise extreme care” before adding cryptocurrencies to potential retirement funds.  Custodia, the Wyoming-based crypto bank founded by Caitlin Long (and previously known as Avanti), sued the Federal Reserve on allegations it violated a one-year deadline for approving master accounts. Custodia applied last year.  Grayscale (a sister company to CoinDesk) tapped Don Verrilli, a former Solicitor General for the U.S., presumably in anticipation of its own potential APA proceeding should the Securities and Exchange Commission reject its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund conversion application next month.  Coin Center sued the U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service and various officials on allegations that the transaction reporting rule enshrined in last year’s infrastructure bill is not constitutional.  Binance.US is being sued by 2,000 investors in LUNA and terraUSD on allegations it misled those same investors by listing the pair of tokens.

This time, buyers are fighting not for a new growth wave, but for the fall not to accelerate. During the last fall wave of April 2022, the THETA price fell below the lower trend line of the fall channel. As early as 6 weeks, the THETA price is consolidating on the trend line, giving dubious feelings to investors. In addition to the tension near the trend line, it should be understood that buyers have lost control of the $1.5 range. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/gZ0nK4jY/ Given this fact, we cannot recommend buying THETA as long as the price is below this range. If by the end of June buyers will not be able to take control of $1.5 - you should expect a reduction of the THETA price to $0.6. The saddest emotions are caused by the THETA trading volumes. There is no struggle or interest in the weekly timeframe. So far, the best case scenario for THETA is the $2.75 test.

Key technical points: The market price has increased 12% over the past 24 hours. The price action shows a retest phase undermining the selling pressure. The 24-hour trading volume of Theta Fuel is $287 Million, indicating a hike of 287%. Past Performance of TFUEL TFUEL prices show a bullish attempt to break above the $0.056 resistance level, the bottom support level of the range, split last weekend. The increase in buying pressure during the retest of the range fallout indicates a high possibility of a price jump exceeding $0.056. Source- Tradingview TFUEL Technical Analysis TFUEL prices showcase a higher price rejection in the daily candle, preventing prices from sustaining above $0.056. Hence, traders hoping for a bullish trend must wait for a price action confirmation. The crucial SMAs - 50, 100, and 200-days maintain a bearish trend, with the 50-day SMA being the first in the line of attack. Hence, the breakout of the 50-day SMA will increase the likelihood of a price jump to the 200-day SMA. The RSI slope shows a bullish reversal from the oversold zone to surpass the 14-day SMA and the halfway line. Hence, the indicator shows an increase in the underlying bullishness.

For the past few months, India&apos;s annual inflation rate has been climbing, as has been the case in many other nations. As a result, more individuals are looking for measures to safeguard their assets against inflation, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin appear to be a great hedge. It is argued that money printing by the central bank would lead to inflation or the devaluation of money over time. In comparison, Bitcoin has a set limit of 21 million coins that may ever be minted. Because of its limited supply, bitcoin is resistant to inflation. Let&apos;s take a closer look. Inflation - A Basic Overview Simply put, inflation is the rising cost of goods and services. In other words, rising prices reduce people&apos;s purchasing power. Therefore, formerly lower-priced goods and services now demand more fiat cash to be acquired. A chocolate bar that cost $10 two years ago now $20. The culprit is inflation. Inflation can be caused by a variety of macroeconomic and microeconomic variables. Most observers feel that persistent inflation occurs when the amount of fiat money in circulation increases in a way that does not correlate to the country&apos;s economic progress. To keep inflation under control, most countries have a national central bank. It regulates the supply of fiat money in circulation and establishes credit limits for the benefit of the national economy. However, these measures have failed time and again,...",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/why-is-bitcoin-the-best-bet-against-inflation/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-is-bitcoin-the-best-bet-against-inflation,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
