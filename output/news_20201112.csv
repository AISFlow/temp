42433123,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3Ddh,1605216579,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hits $16.2K; Uniswap Crosses $3B Locked,"Bitcoin was gaining amid positive institutional and retail adoption signs as the amount of crypto locked in Uniswap signals DeFi continues to be more just than a fad.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $16,154 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.9% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $15,454-$16,186  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin was trending upward Thursday, continuing a direction that started Wednesday. The price per 1 BTC was able to hit as high as $16,186, according to CoinDesk 20 data. However, Guy Hirsch, managing director for U.S. at multi-asset brokerage eToro, cautions choppy waters might be ahead.      “Bitcoin’s struggle to consolidate above the $16,000 price level can likely be attributed to a number of factors including profit taking and capital rotation into some of the small-cap digital assets that have been recently surging,” Hirsch said. “If bitcoin can establish a base in the low-$16,000 range, there isn’t much resistance on the path to $17,000 and beyond.”      Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, echoed the sentiment.      “Bitcoin cleared $16,000 for the first time in three years, confirming the existing bullish uptrend,” Lau said. “With minimal resistance until $20,000, it's hard to tell how the next few weeks will trade into year end, but signs are positive.”      Read More: PayPal Removes Waitlist, Boosts Weekly Crypto Purchase Limit to $20K      Powerfully positive fundamentals in both institutional and retail adoption has Lau bullish.      “Strong institutional interest – BTC futures open interest is at all-time highs – and incoming retail flow – PayPal opened up crypto buys to all U.S. users today – is providing continued fuel for this rally,” Lau told CoinDesk.      Bitcoin futures open interest crossed $8 billion on major venues Wednesday, the highest data aggregator Skew has on record.      “Aggregate bitcoin futures open interest continues to rise and, more importantly, it is not just the unregulated venues that are seeing this growth but also [open interest] on the CME is within touching distance of the $1 billion mark,” noted Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto brokerage Bequant. Total CME open interest for Wednesday was $912 million, according to Skew.      Read More: 98% of Bitcoin’s ‘Unspent Outputs’ Are Worth More Than When Made      Spot bitcoin volume has also been strong Thursday. It was close to $1 billion as of press time, much higher than the past month’s $378 million average daily volume.      Another trend to watch: How decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) impact the bitcoin market during this price surge. “The bulls are in charge of this trend and, as the old saying goes, do not fight the trend,” said Bequant’s Vinokourov. “With top DEX/DeFi venues such as Uniswap and Sushi trading cheap on price/sales ratio, it would not be surprising for them to lead to another wave of capital inflow into small- and mid-cap assets.” A price/sales ratio is common in valuing stocks, and a low ratio generally indicates a good buy.      “Large-cap assets (such as bitcoin) may be leading the charge now, but that will not stop the hunt for yield trade,” Vinokourov added.    Uniswap crosses $3 billion locked    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Thursday, trading around $458 and slipping 1.6% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Ethereum’s Hard Fork Was Trying to Prevent the Very Disruption It Caused      The amount of cryptocurrency “locked” in the DEX Uniswap crossed $3 billion Wednesday. Crypto investors place assets in smart contracts such as Uniswap’s to provide liquidity and, in turn, gain profits, or yield, for doing so in the form of the fees traders pay to use the DEX’s liquidity.      The total locked slipped a bit Thursday but was still hovering around $3 billion as of press time. Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of investment firm Ether Capital, said this metric shows that despite some calling DeFi a fad, it’s here to stay.      “Many skeptics from traditional finance and the crypto community were quick to attribute the summer high trade volume on Uniswap to nothing more than yield farming and pump and dumps,” Mosoff told CoinDesk. “Now that much of that activity has simmered, Uniswap crossing this new milestone is further proof that DeFi and [automated market makers] are here to stay.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are red Thursday.

Marathon isn’t done growing. With the price of bitcoin having risen 82% since May, the firm reportedly has invested $72 million in the same time period to continue to expand its mining operations, although it did not report its current hash power capacity.  During Q3, the company purchased more than 20,000 new mining ASICs.  Marathon is also holding more bitcoin than ever before.  The value of bitcoins held by the firm has more than quadrupled since the previous quarter, reaching $450,000 at the end of Q3. Bitcoin appreciated 17% in Q3 ending the period at $10,600.  “In all previous quarters, we only produced enough BTC that needed to be sold to cover the cost of our operations,” a Marathon spokesperson told CoinDesk via email. But because the firm no longer needs to cover operating costs by selling newly minted bitcoins, the company has started to simply hold the assets.  The company reported a Q3 net loss of $1.99 million, or 6 cents a share, compared with the year-ago loss of $754,407, or 12 cents. A surge in the number of shares outstanding to 31.5 million from 6.37 million, accounts for the halving of the per share loss despite the large increase in the dollar figure loss.  Marathon shares dipped 4% at last check following the earnings release, trading hands at $2.29. So far this year, the shares have risen 155%.

42433107,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3DDh,1605203208,Bitcoin’s Options Market Shows Strongest Bullish Mood on Record,"Bitcoin's options market is in the midst of its strongest bullish sentiment on record as the cryptocurrency rallies to three-year highs.      The six-month put-call skew, or the spread between prices claimed by put options and call options expiring in six months, fell to a life-time low of -21.6% early Thursday, according to data source Skew.      A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option gives the right to sell.      Skew’s data shows the net demand for call options, or bullish bets, is outstripping the net demand for puts, or bearish bets, by the most on record. That's a sign of a build-up of strong bullish expectations in the market.      ""The options market is predicting some topside,"" Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, said.      Bitcoin crossed above $16,000 early Thursday and reached a high of $16,157, a level last seen three years ago. Analysts expect the cryptocurrency to consolidate on recent gains for a couple of weeks before making a move toward $20,000 by the end of December.      The six-month put-call skew has mostly hovered below zero over the past 22 months, indicating investor confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects. However, the value has never been this low.      ""Bull bias might be at an all-time high, but the bitcoin options market is almost permanently bullish. With bitcoin now flirting with $16,000, it’s possible this spike in bullish sentiment comes from new market participants,"" Sui Chung, CEO of crypto index provider CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk.      Also read: 98% of Bitcoin’s ‘Unspent Outputs’ Are Worth More Than When Made      Record bullish or bearish sentiment often marks major market tops or bottoms. ""While not always a concern, extremes tend to revert to a mean,"" Alpha5's Shah told CoinDesk.      However, while the options market sentiment looks to have reached extremes, the cryptocurrency is still $4,000 short of the record high of $20,000 seen in December 2017. Besides, the mean reversion of bullish bias in options, if any, is unlikely to affect the spot market because the options market is still relatively small.      According to Chung, ""The bull bias will likely correct if call premiums become too expensive, which may not be too far away, given the spreads for puts."" That scenario could play out once the cryptocurrency reaches a new record high.      Currently, it doesn’t appear investors are even considering the possibility of a temporary pullback. That's evident from the negative one-month skew. The cryptocurrency's strong break above the June 2019 high of $13,800 has cleared the way for a possible rally toward the previous record.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/12/bitcoins-options-market-shows-strongest-bullish-mood-on-record,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06df3ab4a4401de1eff9d676195944bf7aff5d9e-1200x670.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

DeFi's total value locked hit a lifetime high. Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio said yesterday he isn't keen on bitcoin; a few hours later, the cryptocurrency hit a three-year high.    Top shelf    Cannot dai Dai (DAI), MakerDAO’s dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, reached a $1 billion market capitalization on Wednesday. While there are only 993 million DAI in circulation, its skewed peg of $1.01 has brought it above the milestone metric. “[I]t works, is here to stay, and is the honey badger of Ethereum,” Compound’s Robert Leshner said. About a third of all dai is in the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) smart contract, with most of the remainder (over 620 million,) locked in its ERC-20 smart contract, CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reports. The move comes as the DeFi ecosystem in aggregate passed a new lifetime high of $13.62 billion.      Forfeited funds Chainalysis, in conjunction with confiscated asset consultancy Asset Reality, unveiled a program for storing and selling forfeited crypto. Announced Thursday, the program is targeted towards government clients, many of which rely on Chainalysis’ blockchain sleuthing technology to trace illicit funds. While no clients have been announced, in April, the U.S. Marshals Service, which runs semi-regular forfeiture auctions, said it was looking for a private-sector partner to help it manage and dispose of forfeited cryptocurrency.      Dalio’s dictates Founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Ray Dalio said governments will seek to “outlaw” bitcoin if it becomes “material.” Plodding well-worn territory, Dalio said bitcoin may not even get there due to its volatility and lack of commercial appeal. ""I today can't take my bitcoin yet and buy things easily with it,” he said. Still, governments may “use whatever teeth they have” to break bitcoin’s back, if it becomes necessary, he said.      Staking play Crypto trading firm DARMA Capital unveiled a service to provide Eth 2.0 stakers with liquidity through USDC stablecoin loans. Called, perhaps unimaginatively, LiquidStake, the service will allow users to continue earning interest provided by the Eth 2.0 experiment (which will not allow stakers to recall their assets once pledged) while also using this stake as collateral on a cash-equivalent loan. While other loan providers are testing similar services, DARMA’s has received the backing of the Ethereum establishment, including involvement from ConsenSys, Bison Trails, Figment, OpenLaw and Filecoin. In other Ethereum news, Tel Aviv-based Kirobo revealed a way to reverse erroneous ether transactions.      $7.6B stolen Since 2011, $7.6 billion worth of cryptocurrencies have been stolen through hacks or scams, according to a new Crystal Blockchain report. Approximately $2.8 billion was stolen through 113 security breaches, with a concentration of hacks taking place in the U.S., Japan, U.K., China and South Korea. Another $4.8 billion was stolen through scams, with Crystal Blockchain identifying 23 prominent fraud schemes. Noting the the number of hacks and scams seems to be holding steady, malicious actors are growing more sophisticated. Proper insurance, reserve balances, in-house security teams and blockchain analytics software are all recommended remedies.

(Decrypt)  Market intel    Crossing $16K Bitcoin kissed three-year highs above $16,000 earlier today. At around 10 UTC (5 a.m. ET) the cryptocurrency clocked $16,157, a price point last seen on Jan. 6, 2018, before trending down to the high $15,000s. Bitcoin is now up 123% on a year-to-date basis and has gained nearly 50% so far this quarter. Investors still predict a consolidation between $14,000 to $16,000 before any potential retest of all-time highs of $20,000. ""The interest so far in 2020 has been primarily from institutions and we could see more retail participation when bitcoin breaks its previous all-time highs of $20,000,"" Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, said.      Bitcoin in profit Bitcoin’s rally has had another effect beyond market exuberance and wild-eyed predictions: Nearly all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) are in profit. According to Coin Metrics, 98% of UTXOs are worth more today than the time of creation, a level last seen in December 2017. UTXOs are the value left over after a bitcoin transaction, similar to receiving change after paying cash. So what does it mean for bitcoin’s price? Well, Coin Metric analysts said traders might be encouraged to sell and take their profits, or continue holding, given there’s “ a low risk of capitulation.”    At stake    Bitcoin in Venezuela Venezuela continues to dominate peer-to-peer crypto activity. According to data reviewed by CoinDesk research analyst Duy Nguyen, in GDP-adjusted terms, the South American nation’s P2P bitcoin market is at least twice as high as the next-largest market, Nigeria.      Activity on prominent P2P crypto exchanges LocalBitcoins and Paxful peaked in the first half of 2019, but has since hovered around $20 million. Experts point to a range of factors to explain the successful test case of Venezuelan crypto use: including the nation’s riotous inflation, capital controls and remittance markets, U.S.-led sanctions and the Maduro regime’s experiment with a crypto-backed petro dollar.      The International Monetary Fund measured Venezuelan hyperinflation at 65,374% in 2018, leagues above any other economy. (Zimbabwe, for instance, is projected to run hot at 319% in 2020, though government bans mean P2P BTC trading is near-zero.) Among the 10 economies that have experienced the highest rates of annual inflation since 2017, only Venezuela, Argentina and Iran have shown significant peer-to-peer bitcoin market activity, Nguyen reports.      While macro-level indicators do much to explain a “deflationary” currency like bitcoin’s appeal, significant on the ground factors are at play. Gabriel Jiménez, a Venezuelan blockchain entrepreneur who led the development of the petro, said Venezuelan businesses often use bitcoin as a medium to obtain foreign currencies like the dollar.      “People living in Venezuela are living under a very unstable and predatory government. They suffer from extreme inflation and general economic instability. And here’s a censorship-resistant, inflation-proof asset, so it’s very attractive to people who are looking for a way to maintain value,” Andrea O’Sullivan, director of tech and innovation at James Madison Institute, told Nguyen.

42385111,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnAKP,1605199084,Why DeFi Needs to Branch Out From Ethereum,"The booming world of decentralized finance (DeFi) has reached new heights in recent weeks as the total value of assets locked in the DeFi ecosystem surpasses $13 billion. Arguably the fastest-growing sector in the crypto industry today, DeFi has witnessed an explosive influx of capital and market participants in just a matter of months. Amid this meteoric rise, Ethereum continues to dominate the DeFi space, holding 96% of the total transaction volume.      While this recent growth has accelerated the pace of innovation and experimentation in the DeFi landscape, it has also brought forward valid concerns around its long-term sustainability, particularly in Ethereum’s scalability challenges and high gas fees. There is no denying that flaws exist in the world of Ethereum-based DeFi, with detractors citing over-complexity and risk as significant roadblocks. From re-entrancy attacks on Uniswap and Lendf.me to Yam Finance’s smart contract coding flaws, the high-profile security incidents in the first half of 2020 alone are indicative that the sector’s explosive growth could be taking place at the expense of its safety and stability.    Amrit Kumar is the president, chief scientific officer and co-founder of Zilliqa, the first public blockchain platform built on sharded architecture.    At the same time, the consolidation of DeFi protocols around the Ethereum platform has raised some lingering existential questions: Beyond technical challenges such as network congestion or security issues, should DeFi – with decentralization at its core – be defined solely by a single network?      It’s a question made more acute by major Ethereum infrastructure provider Infura disrupting the entire network, on Wednesday.    Real-world value, real-world risks    With over 100 projects and applications in the ecosystem ranging from decentralized exchanges to lending and insurance platforms, DeFi holds the potential to unlock a parallel financial system by making money, payments and other financial services universally accessible. However, we, as an industry, would do well to remember that trial and error only extends so far when it comes to digital assets with real-world value.      For DeFi to consider a sustainable future, developers must behave with security at the forefront of all that they do, ensuring that existing infrastructures and security measures will be able to keep pace with the industry’s breakneck rate of growth. On top of that, the industry needs to start communicating the risks for what they are in order to keep new users from finding their life savings disappearing into the digital abyss.      Adapting the approach of traditional financial institutions, DeFi projects should invest ample time to perform rigorous security audits and code reviews. In addition to implementing bug bounty programs to catch vulnerabilities before they result in user losses, projects should also be much more transparent about their network vulnerabilities by publishing open post-mortems to the public so that other applications in the ecosystem can learn from the incidents and prevent them from happening in future. This sort of transparency would be beneficial to building trust among users and charting a more secure path towards mainstream adoption.      See also: Edan Yago - Forget Ethereum, DeFi Is Being Built on Bitcoin      The incidents involving Yam Finance, bZx and SushiSwap this summer have highlighted the serious inadequacies in today’s existing smart contract infrastructures, which led to security breaches linked to human error.      Since the infamous 2016 DAO hack, Ethereum’s Solidity has shown a degree of vulnerability. In the case of the DAO hack, malicious actors exploited the “fallback function” in the destination smart contract to create an execution loop that calls the “withdraw” function of the victim’s smart contract until either the balance of the victim’s smart contract is zero or the transaction gas is depleted. Solidity is just one centralized point of failure in smart contract design, developers must reckon with.      As smart contract development is still a relatively new field, security vulnerabilities and compromises are to be expected as part of the growing pains of any emerging technology. For this reason, it is crucial that smart contract developers keep track of new security developments and stay up to date with the industry’s best practices.      Deploying measures such as testnets, bug bounties or a phased rollout plan allows developers to mitigate risks and catch bugs before a full production release. In addition, smart contract developers who are building on Ethereum need to be aware of the EVM’s idiosyncrasies and work around them accordingly.    Developments in diversification    As DeFi looks to cement a sustainable future, the sector also needs to look to a future beyond Ethereum.      After all, the ongoing argument for interoperability should not only apply to blockchain as a whole, but must equally extend to the industry’s most pre-eminent use case – DeFi. Within the traditional financial system, the majority of payments infrastructure is interoperable, meaning that cardholders can make payments anywhere in the world, regardless of what the local currency is.      On the other hand, the blockchains of today exist in silos and are still unable to communicate with each other and exchange value. Without establishing cross-chain interoperability, the DeFi movement will remain in the shadow of traditional finance. To solve this issue, the DeFi development community have devised different ways to provide new forms of interoperability, from atomic swaps and wrapped tokens to cross-chain communication platforms.      See also: Matt Luongo - Why Hardnosed Bitcoiners Can Learn to Love DeFi      While solving these issues are imperative to the advancement of DeFi as a whole, the industry also needs to take a more collaborative approach in building a more diverse ecosystem of DeFi-centric applications on different platforms, rather than sticking to one network.      Outside of Ethereum, other smart contract protocols are also growing their own respective DeFi ecosystems. Such alternative projects are set to play a vital role in the field of DeFi, potentially opening a new chapter in its development. Ethereum may have the first-mover advantage as the pioneering smart contracts platform with the greatest number of token holders, but further experimentation and diversification is needed to encourage innovation and greater technical optimization over time.      Already, we have begun to see significant developments across the DeFi landscape with the growth of new financial products from savings, payments and lending. With the sector’s evident appeal, not just for emerging economies but also companies locked out of traditional finance in developed economies, DeFi holds a great deal of potential in democratizing access to a new financial model in this digital age.      But for the industry to climb out of the shadows of traditional finance, DeFi needs to first overcome its existential challenges and growing pains, in order to flourish and fulfill its promise as a sustainable alternative to traditional finance.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Amrit Kumar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/12/why-defi-needs-to-branch-out-from-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1e35913270c6881850d6c429019a254262d77ab-1240x930.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385106,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnAE7,1605193508,How Ant’s Suspended IPO Is Related to China’s Digital Yuan,"Ant Group’s suspended initial public offering (IPO) has shed further light on a possible motivation behind China’s digital yuan. The Chinese government appears to view the payments giant as a destabilizing force to China’s economy, and the digital yuan is a way to keep companies like this in check.      Industry watchers say the People's Bank of China (PBoC) might use the digital yuan as part of a broader effort to curb the growth of Alipay and WeChat Pay. The central bank digital currency (CBDC) could stunt Alipay's micro-lending business and provide the unbanked with financial services, while also drawing back deposits for commercial banks.      Ant’s IPO exposes fault lines in the digital payment industry, and China’s central bank is motivated to launch the digital yuan and give itself more power to keep third-party payment platforms in check, Tanvi Ratna, CEO of fintech think tank Policy 4.0, said. Policy 4.0 has been working on an extensive research report on China's national digital currency that will be released on Nov 18.      The Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges halted Ant’s $35 billion dual IPO last week after China’s financial regulators raised concerns over Ant’s booming micro-lending business, which could add more debt to the country’s highly leveraged economy.    Ant’s co-lending subsidiary Huabei, which is a built-in virtual credit card in Alipay, facilitates loans between commercial banks and borrowers, while Jiabei is the short-term consumer loan provider. Though it enjoys as much as a 40% cut of loan interest, Alipay bears far less in credit risk than the banks. Only 2% of the loans Ant had facilitated as of June were on its balance sheet, according to its IPO prospectushttps://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2020/102484/documents/sehk20082500535.pdf.    One way for the central bank to control Alipay’s lending business is to require the company to convert cash into the digital yuan to underwrite consumer loans.      “The bank can make it more costly for digital payment platforms to use the digital yuan to lend money, and this might be something the government might want to force,” Ratna said.      One day before Ant’s IPO, China’s top financial regulators published a consultation paper to require online lenders to provide at least 30% of any loan they fund jointly with banks, making it more difficult for Ant to lend money.      Ant’s booming lending business has struck a nerve with China’s top financial regulators at a time when the country is already battling increasing default risks and weak banks. To curb fintech giants’ growing influence over the country’s economy, Beijing’s authorities proposed a new set of anti-monopolistic practices on fintech companies on Wednesday.      “China is very conscious about its debt problem. A lot of businesses do not have cash flows, especially after the coronavirus pandemic,” Ratna said. “Ant is pushing out personal loans, a lot of which could go bad.”      Alipay has not always been forthcoming in reporting its consumer lending data to Chinese banks. While Huabei and Jiebei were launched in January 2018, they did not share data with the central bank until the end of July this year, at the central bank’s request.      The digital yuan can increase financial transparency and efficiency by helping banks better track and analyze non-performing assets, Ratna said.      “For the central bank, it is very important that the underlying asset becomes the digital yuan,” she said. “It can help the bank to solve many chronic problems in the financial system, including shadow banking, non-performing loans and too much informal financing.”    Deposits leak    China’s payment giants pose other threats as well. Commercial banks in China have been losing cash deposits to non-banking payment platforms. The Chinese mobile banking market saw about $8 trillion worth of transactions in the last three months of 2019, with Alipay taking 55% of the market and WeChat Pay having 39%.      Alipay has one of the world’s largest money market funds called Yu’e Bao, which essentially is a mutual fund that usually invests in safe asset classes such as treasury bonds to earn interest that is higher than many of the saving accounts in commercial banks. Its users tend to put their in-app cash into the fund. With other similar funds on its distribution platform, Alipay had nearly $600 billion in total assets as of June.      “Loan-to-deposit ratio determines how much money a commercial bank can lend,” Aurora Wong, vice president of crypto firm ZB Group, said. “More cash deposits enable the banks to lend more, which is one of the most lucrative businesses by earning interest.”      China’s commercial banks need to maintain or raise their deposit base to keep up with lending, especially when the economic slowdown deepens.      Some of the commercial banks in China hope retail depositors will use the digital yuan in their payment transactions. When the users convert the virtual currency back to fiat, the cash will remain in the bank accounts instead of on mobile payment apps.      The latest attempt to encourage mass adoption of the digital yuan was a $1.5 million giveaway by PBOC in October for Shenzhen citizens, Wong said.      Each of the 50,000 participants, who downloaded the digital wallet, would be selected in a lottery to receive about $30 during the week-long campaign. Stores in Shenzhen posted the QR code for the wallet users to scan and pay for their purchases.      The digital yuan’s benefits for China’s commercial banks go beyond increasing cash deposits. With a larger user base, the banks will have more transaction data to profile consumers, analyze their online behavior and experiment with different ways to monetize the data.      “Commercial banks in China are becoming more similar to fintech companies,” Wong said. “I think this won’t be the last virtual currency giveaway and there will be even more programs to incentivize consumers to use the wallets from commercial banks.”    Mass adoption    Still, Alipay and WeChat Pay are standing in the way of the digital yuan’s mass adoption. During last month’s trial giveaway, some shoppers preferred to use these two mobile payment apps because they are more convenient.      “The question of adoption is a difficult one for central banks,” Ratna said. “This is the bread and butter for a startup but it is not something that the central banks have experienced.”      Favorable regulatory policies for the digital yuan, unique technical features that enable the unbanked to access basic financial services and improving user experience for native digital wallets are among the most likely ways to increase mass adoption for the digital yuan.      One technical feature that sets the digital yuan apart from Alipay in terms of payment is that users do not need a bank account to be linked to a mobile app in order to do cash transactions.      China has more than 225 million people without a bank account, which is one of the largest unbanked populations in the world, according to a 2017 report from Global Findex.      The digital yuan account has a sliding scale of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements corresponding to the amount of digital yuan you want to own and use, said Chuanwei Zou, chief economist of blockchain infrastructure firm PlatOn, said.      “The more identity information you register with the digital yuan wallet, the more digital yuan you can have in the wallet,” Zou said.      For Alipay and WeChat Pay, their users have to register with their bank accounts, which requires a government-issued ID. The app will also use facial recognition and cell phone numbers to verify identities.      Users only with an equivalent of a few thousand dollars in their digital yuan wallets could remain fully anonymous, which would be beneficial to many small retail depositors in China, Zou said.      The decoupling from a bank account also helps foreigners in China and those who have the demand for renminbi transactions outside the country. The central bank plans to launch a trial during the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in 2022, where foreigners in China can directly exchange other fiat currencies for the digital yuan without carrying cash or opening a bank account.      The digital yuan enables foreigners to buy goods and services in China, and allows anyone outside China to transfer funds across borders, without using a bank account since the virtual currency will be part of a closed system managed by PBOC, Zou said.      “The digital yuan will definitely change the market structure of digital payment in terms of the last-mile adoption,” Zou said. “We already have commercial banks’ mobile apps, Alipay and WeChat Pay and there would probably be a native app for the virtual currency, which can be a standalone app but can also be integrated into third-party payment apps.”      China’s four major commercial banks have included the digital yuan account in their mobile apps, while the central bank has yet to let Alipay and WeChat Pay integrate the digital yuan as a payment option in their apps.      Like many other significant policy changes, the Chinese government has been approaching its national virtual currency initiative in a trial-and-error fashion, Ratna said.      “The central bank has not really played all its cards yet,” she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/12/how-ants-suspended-ipo-is-related-to-chinas-digital-yuan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5b6390423de95654c5be71dab085977d0e5abf8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385117,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnAPR,1605190347,First Mover: Bitcoin Breaches $16K as (Committed) Holders Diss Dalio's Diss,"Bitcoin briefly climbed above $16,000 for the first time in three years before quickly falling back below the psychological threshold.      Digital-asset market traders and analysts say the cryptocurrency is likely to make another run higher, with strong demand expected from traditional investors looking for a hedge against inflation, at a time when sellers appear unwilling to part with their bitcoin holdings.      ""Against the backdrop of stimulus from the Federal Reserve, we expect investors holding cash to continue to allocate to bitcoin,"" said Kyle Davies, co-founder of the digital-asset fund Three Arrows Capital.      In traditional markets, European shares headed toward their first drop of the week on disappointing earnings reports, and U.S. stock futures pointed toward a lower open.      A powerhouse panel discussion between Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey is scheduled for 5:45 p.m. central European time (16:45 universal coordinated time, 11:45 a.m in New York). The topic is “central banks in a shifting world.”      Gold strengthened 0.2% to $1,870 an ounce.      Read More: Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $16K for First Time in 3 Years    Market moves    Ok, so apparently hedge fund titan Ray Dalio doesn't like bitcoin.      But guess who's not selling? People who already own it – and look to profit handsomely from doing so.      The oldest and largest cryptocurrency doubled last year, and it's doubled again in 2020. Compare that with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, which has gained 44% since the start of 2019.      So what's happened, according to data extracted from the Bitcoin blockchain, is that holders of the cryptocurrency are now nearly unanimously in the money – sitting on paper profits, as it were. And that might be because they simply don't want to part with the digital asset that's already made them so much money.      It also means that nobody's really even close to needing to cut bait. And since many investors view bitcoin as an of out-of-the-money option on economic armageddon, rampant inflation, a revolution in financial technology or all of the above, they're just letting the bet ride.      As reported Thursday by CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole, the percentage of so-called ""unspent transaction outputs,"" or UTXOs, recently topped 98%, a level not seen since the bull run in late 2017. As well, the number of UTXOs in profit reached a record high of over 110 million. A UTXO is a digital representation of bitcoin or a chunk of bitcoin.      ""A high percentage of UTXOs in profit potentially signals that there is relatively low sell pressure since there's a low risk of capitulation,"" the cryptocurrency analysis firm Coin Metrics wrote this week in a report.      Sure, bitcoin might be the biggest bubble the world has ever seen – and the holders might be deluding themselves to believe these gains can continue forever. It also could be that bitcoin is just at the beginning of that bubble.      Charlie Morris, CEO of the cryptocurrency fund manager ByteTree, has been arguing all year that bitcoin is really a technology, which partly explains why it has historically traded in sync with the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock index. On Thursday, Morris noted in a newsletter that bitcoin has recently, and noticeably, started to outperform large tech stocks. (See chart below.)      ""Just as investors flock to gold when they see it outperforming the stock market, I believe bitcoin will attract capital from tech,"" Morris wrote. ""We can be fairly certain that tech is a bubble, yet bitcoin isn’t.""      It just so happens that many hedge funds like Dalio's Bridgewater tout their own track records when they're casting about for funds from big investors like pension funds, endowments and rich family wealth offices. (At least one Twitter troll was quick to compare Dalio's fund performance with bitcoin's. Spoiler alert: Dalio loses.)      Whatever the case, bitcoin holders appear satisfied with the cryptocurrency's performance, and they appear to be sticking with it.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin's first attempt to establish a foothold above $16,000 has failed for now. The cryptocurrency rose to a three-year high of $16,157 early Thursday only to fall back quickly to $15,700.      The failure to keep gains above the psychological hurdle could be attributed to overbought conditions signaled by technical indicators.      Analysts told CoinDesk Wednesday the cryptocurrency is likely to consolidate for a couple of weeks before resuming the uptrend and challenging the record high of $20,000 by the end of December.      It remains to be seen if the bulls take a breather as anticipated by analyst or push for early test of record highs. The latter cannot be ruled out as the market is facing sell-side liquidity issues and it's easier for the bulls to force rapid price rallies. The options market is showing strong bullish sentiment with the demand for call options outstripping the demand for put options by the most on record.      The cryptocurrency has recovered back to $15,900 and could soon cross back above $16,000. Another rejection above that level would validate overbought signals and may yield a bigger pullback than the one seen early Thursday.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Likely to Consolidate Before December Rise Toward $20K, Say Analysts    What's hot    Ethereum's ""unannounced hard fork"" was trying to prevent the very disruption it caused (CoinDesk)      DeFi pioneer MakerDAO's dollar-linked DAI stablecoin breaks $1B market capitalization (CoinDesk)      Stablecoin issuer TrustToken taps Chainlink for on-chain proof of reserves for TrueUSD dollar-linked token (CoinDesk)      U.S. representatives rip OCC Commissioner Brooks for ""excessive focus"" on crypto industry (CoinDesk)      Bridgewater’s Dalio sees governments banning bitcoin should it become ""material"" (CoinDesk)      African startups should tokenize debt and equity on blockchain to ""break the white man's curse"" (CoinDesk Opinion)      Pakistan securities regulators publish position paper on regulating digital assets (SEC Pakistan)      Venezuela's peer-to-peer bitcoin volume relative to the size of its economy is the highest in the world, due to factors including migration, capital controls, risk of government seizure, demand for hard money and exposure to the petro, the cryptocurrency backed by the government (CoinDesk)      Ethereum heavyweights launch LiquidStake loans to stake the stakers in staking system 2.0 upgrade tests get underway (CoinDesk)      Flash loans aren't the problem, centralized price oracles are (CoinDesk Opinion)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    OPEC deepens forecast for drop in global oil demand, down 10% from 2020 levels, trims expectations for 2021 rebound (WSJ)      U.S. commercial banks are reducing already-low interest rates on customer savings as deposits swell to $15.9T from $13.2T at start of year (WSJ)      Russia says ""Sputnik V"" vaccine is 92% effective at preventing coronavirus cases (Reuters)      Japan’s Nikkei Index hit a near 29-and-a-half-year high on the back of favorable tech shares trading in Asia and the U.S. (Reuters)      Failed IPO of Jack Ma's Ant Group has led to several companies advancing their own offerings in Hong Kong looking to take advantage of surplus liquidity (Nikkei Asian Review)    Tweet of the Day",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/12/first-mover-bitcoin-breaches-16k-as-committed-holders-diss-dalios-diss,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80ca85d9be1ead41b1182426fb3a79f305b5ed1c-1400x931.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42385108,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnACr,1605189623,‘Chainlink Killer’ API3 Closes $3M Funding Round With Placeholder and Pantera,"When it comes to solving the so-called “oracle problem,” or the way blockchains are connected to outside data sources, we can do better.      So says API3, a project building a transparent methodology for marrying blockchains to the APIs of data providers, which really means providing an alternative to Chainlink, the decentralized oracle service with something of a monopoly in the world of data feeds and smart-contract blockchains.      Announced Thursday, API3, which promises a decentralized API (dAPI) network, has raised $3 million in a private funding round led by Placeholder and with participation from Pantera, CoinFund and Digital Currency Group (which is also the owner of CoinDesk).      Because blockchain nodes are consumed with the business of reaching consensus, they must obtain outside information via oracle nodes, a sort of middleware between the ledger and the API of some data provider. According to Heikki Vänttinen, co-founder of API3, this intermediary function is handled by rent-seeking middlemen who run nodes on Chainlink, which in turn operates an opaque system of governance.      A better solution is to allow API providers themselves to run their own nodes, said Vänttinen. That way, the process of governing the curation of data feeds can be done in a transparent and decentralized manner.      “We just saw some shortcomings in the way they [Chainlink] basically operate their data feeds on the oracle network as a whole,” said Vänttinen, who was one of the first Chainlink node operators. “The core team is this sort of centralized black box for the data feeds, deciding unilaterally which nodes get to serve which data feeds and also which APIs those nodes serve data from,” he said.      Placeholder’s Chris Burniske turned up the heat.      “Crypto’s largest oracle system by network value, Chainlink, is composed of data-reselling middlemen, where the source and quality of data are suspect,” he said in a statement. “While heavily marketed, Chainlink isn’t well enough designed or maintained to remain a long-term solution for crypto or DeFi’s information needs, and those that rely on Chainlink do so at their own users’ risk. Enter API3.”    The Chainlink advantage    However, a Chainlink Labs spokesman said a quick look at one of the widely used feeds like ETH/USD, shows multiple leading data providers, such as Kaiko, running their own nodes.      “The Chainlink system possesses a key advantage,"" the spokesman told CoinDesk via email. ""It enables data providers to sell their data to multiple blockchains without the need to run any additional software. Chainlink not only enables data providers to run their own nodes, and many already do on production today, but also enables them to sell their existing APIs into the Chainlink Network with zero changes to their infrastructure.”      This purposeful design decision provides Chainlink users access to a broader selection of data providers, the spokesman said, adding:    “It’s a starkly different improved approach from that of API3, which requires all data providers to operate and manage new infrastructure to even get started. Chainlink’s origin-signed data capabilities are complemented by the even more important capability that allows smart contracts to access any and all APIs, a key feature API3 clearly lacks.""    Read more: TrustToken Taps Chainlink for On-Chain Proof of Reserves for TrueUSD Stablecoin      Vänttinen says the API3 approach makes it painless and easy for API providers – from crypto-price crunchers to weather forecast APIs that plug into insurance apps – to set up as oracles. The API3 Airnode is “a very simple serverless function that the data provider can deploy on their existing cloud provider platform – you set it and forget it,” said Vänttinen. Alternatively, running a Chainlink node is “basically a full-time job” to keep operational, he said.      Chainlink pointed out that since API3 removes the reliability of having each oracle running its own full nodes would make this approach highly susceptible to things like the recent Infura downtime event.      ""API3 doesn't have oracles that run their own Ethereum or other nodes, which means they are forced to rely on centralized third parties to broadcast their results,” the Chainlink Labs representative said. “This means that API3 is entirely dependent on services like Infura being live, which as we've seen recently, can fail for hours at a time, which in API3's case, would lead to hours of downtime, out of sync market prices and therefore massive losses for users.”    DeFi bonanza    The recent DeFi boom saw Chainlink node operators cashing in. For example, the monthly subsidies earned by each of the top three Chainlink node operators was close to $100,000 per month between August and October this year. According to research carried out by The Block, between August and October, ChainLayer made over $322,000, LinkPool over $306,000, CertusOne over $293,000 and Fiews over $282,000. September was a particularly good month for them, as the top three nodes all made over $160,000 in said subsidies.      By contrast, the API providers are paid a couple of orders of magnitude less and don't even know their data is being resold in these applications, said Vänttinen. The monthly subscription fees paid to those providers by node operators could range between $100-$200 per month, perhaps running as high as $400, Vänttinen said, adding that the terms and conditions of these subscriptions usually prohibit the third-party reselling of data.      Read more: Flash Loans Aren’t the Problem, Centralized Price Oracles Are      “With its Airnode design, API3 makes it seamless for primary data providers to pipe their information into cyptonetworks with zero blockchain expertise,” said Burniske. “That means the reputation and quality of existing data providers can carry into cryptoland, simultaneously allowing these entities to turn a profit from crypto participation.      ""Furthermore,"" he said, ""API3’s organizational DAO structure provides a framework for truly decentralized on-chain data feeds, which the team calls dAPIs.""",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | LINK | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/12/chainlink-killer-api3-closes-3m-funding-round-with-placeholder-and-pantera,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fbfedb4e3dbc68cfb489ddd9e8eabea70caf482-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385104,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnAAL,1605189606,Brent Crude Oil Futures Now Tradable on DeFi Exchange Synthetix,"You can now carry exposure to world oil markets in your decentralized finance (DeFi) portfolio, thanks to the listing of Brent Crude Futures (Brent) on trading platform Synthetix.      Using syndicated data from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the Synthetic Oil (sOIL) token is live today on the Synthetix trading platform, according to a release shared early with CoinDesk.      Brent is one of two major futures contracts for global oil markets, the other being West Texas Intermediate (WTI). The contract tracks the future price of oil found in the North Sea and generally helps set the spot price of European oil. Outside of fiat-backed stablecoins, the product is one of the first real world assets to enter DeFi trading.      Read more: What Is DeFi?      The addition of more real world assets “will be up to the community to request,” Synthetix founder Kain Warwick told CoinDesk in a Telegram message, adding that there is “a lot of interest in adding other commodities.""      Pricing data for sOIL is supplied by data provider Chainlink, further sourced from ICE for an undisclosed sum. Framework Labs, sister company of venture capital firm Framework Ventures, helped syndicate the data.      “Connecting key financial infrastructure to next-generation smart contracts is a key step in the continued evolution of the DeFi ecosystem. We look forward to helping Synthetix continually expand the collection of assets it supports and working with Framework Labs to onboard more traditional players to DeFi,”Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in a statement.    Synthetix and oil    Synthetix – which conducted an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018 for its ERC-20 styled Synth (SNX) token – enables the creation of synthetic financial contracts using its native token.      The platform currently offers 24 trading pairs ranging from cryptocurrencies to crypto indices to foreign exchange (FX) such as the euro. Each tradable contract is backed by a 750% collateralization of SNX and mimics price movements of the chosen asset through an oracle. SNX is currently trading hands at $4.12, according to Messari.      sOIL contracts and the data syndication necessary were first proposed by community members under Synthetix Improvement Proposal (SIP) 49 and 62 in March and May, respectively.      Real-world assets in DeFi have only made a soft impression to date due to the technical and philosophical constraints behind blockchain-based financial alternatives. For example, MarkerDAO, the oldest DeFi project, has weighed the addition of railroad invoices and music royalties for collateralizing its dai (DAI) stablecoin while lending platform Aave has more recently begun working toward tokenizing mortgages with RealT.      Crafting a tradable synthetic DeFi contract for oil also proved difficult, Warwick said, particularly in light of the physically deliverable nature of Brent.      “There were a number of issues around governance and formulating the algo for the price feeds, but the main reason was needing to ensure we have the most robust price feeds for the aggregator network possible,” Warwick said. “The team at [cryptofinance firm] XBTO helped construct a formula that took all of the current futures contracts and rolled them into a proxy for a spot price.”",POSITIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | LINK | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/12/brent-crude-oil-futures-now-tradable-on-defi-exchange-synthetix,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9957bec0694c7dbf09ed23e97a3dcfea11339e1d-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385100,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnA95,1605182872,Russian Ministry Moves to Soften Requirements for Crypto Tax Reporting,"Russia's Ministry of Finance has proposed new amendments to the country's coming law on crypto assets that could soften the requirements for cryptocurrency taxpayers, news agency RBK reported Thursday.      According a package of draft bills, individuals must report their holdings if annual transactions exceed 600,000 Russian rubles (about $7,800). In a previous proposal, the ministry had sought disclosure when transactions pass 100,000 rubles (around $1,300) in one year.      With the law planned to be passed by January, the ministry wants holdings for the next tax year to be disclosed no later than April 30, 2022. The value of the crypto reported will be calculated by the national tax agency based on the prices at the moment of transactions, the bill reads.      Failure to declare the full amount of cryptocurrency owned in a timely manner, as well as not paying taxes on it, will lead to fines. If a taxpayer doesn't declare his crypto for three years in a row, the punishment will be tougher: up to six months in jail for undeclared crypto worth 15 million rubles (~$195,000) and up to three years in prison for 45 million rubles (~$586,000) and more.      Cryptocurrency miners and over-the-counter (OTC) brokers will have to report deals to Rosfinmonitoring, the agency assigned with preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. The agency earlier reportedly planned to develop its own blockchain-tracing tool to connect crypto addresses with users' identities.      Also read: Russian Hydropower Giant Opens Bitcoin Mining Farm      A previous proposed bill by the regulator sought to ban miners located in Russia and using Russia-based infrastructure from being rewarded for their work in cryptocurrency. That wording prompted fears that mining might be outlawed in Russia altogether, and hasn't been clarified since.      These amendments, however, are not as harsh as one of the first draft bills, which sought punishment for facilitating crypto transactions in Russia of up to seven years in prison. That version provoked an outcry among the Russian crypto community and even criticism from other ministries.      Mikhail Tretyak, IT expert at the Digital Rights Center, told CoinDesk he believes the new amendment draft, while less harsh than the previous versions, might still scare away crypto entrepreneurs. ""Part of the market will go to the darknet,"" he said. ""Others might choose emigration to the countries with softer regulatory regimes, and people are asking us for help with this more and more each day.""

42385115,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnAMv,1605181189,98% of Bitcoin's 'Unspent Outputs' Are Worth More Than When Made,"A bitcoin on-chain metric has increased to three-year highs, suggesting a potential supply shortage and low odds of significant price pullback. While there are conflicting interpretations about this latest signal, many market observers are taking it to be positive for the cryptocurrency.      The percentage of bitcoin unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in profit recently topped 98%, the highest level since December 2017, according to data source Coin Metrics. As well, the number of UTXOs in profit reached a record high of over 110 million.      The data indicates a large number of holders are currently making money on their coins and may decide either to hold or liquidate, depending on their outlook. Their next step may influence the price trajectory.      ""A high percentage of UTXOs in profit potentially signals that there is relatively low sell pressure since there's a low risk of capitulation. Conversely, it could signal that some investors may soon start taking profits if the potential gains become too good to pass up,"" according to Coin Metrics' ""State of Network: Issue 76.""      A UTXO is any chunk of bitcoin that hasn't yet been spent by the current holder, so it can be thought of as all the chunks of bitcoin currently held. A profit-making UTXO is the one whose price at the time of creation is less than the current market price.      Capitulation is the point where investors give up trying to recapture lost gains and sell into the falling market, leading to a more profound decline. Currently, most investors are making money on their investments, and the risk of capitulation is almost nil. Besides, the market mood is bullish, and holders are unlikely to book profits anytime soon.      Analysts expect the cryptocurrency to consolidate in the short-term before challenging the record high of $20,000 before the year-end.      ""Most investors that have held steady for this long would continue to hold till new all-time highs, causing a supply shortage, and acting as a positive reinforcement loop, leading prices higher,"" Connor Abendschein, research analyst at Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk in an email.      Large spot buyers have already caused the drying up of sell-side liquidity, and the situation could intensify with the uptick in the percent of UTXOs in profit.      ""Between Grayscale's GBTC trust, MicroStrategy, and the influx of other large spot buyers, the supply of bitcoin is beginning to look more scarce,"" Matthew Dibb, CEO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk's parent firm, Digital Currency Group.      At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading near $15,800, having reached a three-year high of $16,157 early Thursday.

Announced Thursday, the Retrievable Transfer service is now available to users transacting in the network’s native ether token.  “The use of our logic layer finally eliminates the need to send a test transaction, sharply reducing the level of anxiety users feel when transferring funds to a third party,” said Asaf Naim, CEO at Kirobo.  Available to users of MetaMask and any wallet that uses the WalletConnect protocol, Retrievable Transfer allows users to reclaim funds sent to the wrong address by generating a password that is entered by the sender.  The receiver of the funds must also enter the matching password; failure to do so allows the sender to reclaim the funds, reversing the transaction.  In addition, the service is also designed to safeguard against sending funds to smart contracts that don’t support deposits, as well as man-in-the-middle attacks, according to Kirobo.  ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum will also be supported by the service at a later date, the startup said.

The world's top cryptocurrency by market capitalization clocked a high of $16,157 at 10:12 UTC, a price point last seen on Jan. 6, 2018.  The move ended a week of consolidation in the range of $14,000 to $16,000.  Bitcoin is now up 123% on a year-to-date basis and has gained nearly 50% so far this quarter, according to CoinDesk 20 data.  With the U.S. election in the rearview mirror, projected President-elect Joe Biden's stance could have an influence on fiscal policy over the next four years, which could, in turn, affect inflation, against which bitcoin is touted as a hedge.  ""Against the backdrop of stimulus from the Federal Reserve, we expect investors holding cash to continue to allocate to bitcoin,"" said Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital.  ""The interest so far in 2020 has been primarily from institutions and we could see more retail participation when bitcoin breaks its previous all-time highs of $20,000,"" Davies added.  The cryptocurrency has recently received validation from several public companies and prominent investors as a store of value asset and is facing a supply crunch due to increased institutional participation.  U.S. billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller disclosed on Monday a bitcoin position and said bitcoin will outperform gold in the long run.  Analysts also told CoinDesk the bitcoin price may consolidate for a short period before moving toward $20,000 in December.  Other top cryptocurrencies were also in the green with ether and litecoin posting gains of between 1%-2% and OMG rising 8% on the day, according to data by CoinDesk 20.

42385109,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnAFN,1605164400,"Hackers, Scammers Have Stolen $7.6B in Crypto Since 2011","Since 2011, $7.6 billion worth of cryptocurrencies have been stolen, according to a new report from Amsterdam-based blockchain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain. The total figure breaks down into two sadly predictable buckets – hacks and scams.      The report found that $2.8 billion was stolen through security breaches, the most popular breach being via a cryptocurrency exchange’s security systems. In total, the firm documented 113 security breaches; the largest of these was the Coincheck breach in 2018, which saw hackers make off with more than $535 million worth of NEM coins.      The United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, China and South Korea experienced the most exchange security breaches. U.S. crypto services were targeted 13 times, topping the list.      Read more: Social Engineering: A Plague on Crypto and Twitter, Unlikely to Stop      Another $4.8 billion was stolen through scams, with Crystal Blockchain identifying 23 prominent fraud schemes.      ""We deemed $7.6 billion as the total amount for all the years combined in one sum. Basically a cumulative sum for the last 10 years,"" said Kyrylo Chykhradze, a product director of Crystal Blockchain.      In terms of the value stolen, China led the pack by far. The report attributed its ranking mainly to the 2019 PlusToken Ponzi scheme ($2.9 billion) along with the 2020 WoToken scam ($1 billion) that was connected to the PlusToken.      The majority of crypto exchanges that were hacked had insufficient security and low-level verification for withdrawals, such as just an email or phone number.      In the case of Coincheck, for example, the company kept most of its assets in a wallet connected to other external networks. It also lacked multisignature security entirely, which would have required multiple key holders to sign off before funds were moved.      Read more: Multisignature Wallets Can Keep Your Coins Safer (If You Use Them Right)      Chykhradze said the main reason for vulnerabilities in the tech is the industry continues to evolve at a very fast pace, and more and more entities are appearing on the market with inadequate and ""neglected"" internal security policies.      “Their security policies are neglected because these new services cannot (financially) afford to pay as much attention to such security issues, whereas well-established entities are in a better position to ensure and prioritize security,” he said in an email to CoinDesk. “This results in newer services becoming cherry-picking opportunities for bad actors who can spot those vulnerabilities.”    Hackers are becoming more sophisticated    The report's conclusion doesn’t offer much of a silver lining. It observes that over the last few years the number of attacks have remained high. Even large-scale exchanges, which would ostensibly have better security measures, have experienced breaches. The report also predicts that, given that methods used by hackers have continued to become more sophisticated, attacks will only continue to grow in number.      Chykhradze said they see SIM-swapping on the rise; this scam is industry-agnostic, afflicting cryptocurrency players as well as those in other sectors.      “But what has really changed and developed is the way that these criminals are laundering stolen funds. These entities scrutinize services to understand their [anti-money laundering/know your customer] policies as well as policies related to privacy coins in the service's offering,” he said.      “Services with lower barriers for KYC or privacy coin entry are better opportunities for laundering. This is another critical point to consider in crypto service security, how do we make stolen fund laundering almost impossible for bad actors?”      By way of solution, a few basic security measures for all crypto exchanges were recommended, particularly when exchanges use hot wallets. One is having proper insurance for special cases, a second is retaining an in-house security team, the third is using blockchain analytics software and last is making sure to have assets in reserves equivalent to the amount of cryptocurrencies in online storage.      “We can assume that the number of attacks and schemes will continue to grow as the blockchain industry and the crypto market grows,” said Chykhradze, “especially with this latest bitcoin bull run we are currently experiencing and the influx of new business.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/12/hackers-scammers-have-stolen-76b-in-crypto-since-2011,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5cf5eaf1a76bb22267d8a24d0995762c75f51bae-2560x1674.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
