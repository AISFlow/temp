35260174,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650264,1730154617,Are ‚ÄòETF Paper Bitcoins‚Äô Suppressing BTC Prices? Analyst Provides Answers,"In a new YouTube video titled ‚ÄúThere Is No ETF Paper Bitcoin,‚Äù Fred Krueger, an investor at the crypto hedge fund 2718.fund, delved into the growing concerns surrounding US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and their impact on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price. Krueger aimed to dispel the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that have been circulating about ‚Äúpaper Bitcoin‚Äù‚Äîthe notion that ETFs might be selling Bitcoin they do not actually possess‚Äîand to explain why Bitcoin‚Äôs price has not surged as dramatically as some might expect, despite significant ETF purchases. Krueger began his analysis by acknowledging the prevalent skepticism in the market. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs all this paper Bitcoin, and ETFs don‚Äôt really have the Bitcoin, and if they were buying all this Bitcoin, how come Bitcoin price is not higher?‚Äù he stated, encapsulating the core concerns of many investors. Historically, the concept of ‚Äúpaper Bitcoin‚Äù has been associated with exchanges that sold Bitcoin to customers without actually possessing the underlying assets. Krueger highlighted several high-profile instances where this practice led to significant losses for investors. He cited the case of Mt. Gox. Another example he provided was QuadrigaCX, a Canadian exchange that collapsed under mysterious circumstances. Founder Gerald Cotten allegedly died in India, taking with him the private keys to the exchange‚Äôs cold wallets, effectively locking away customer funds. ‚ÄúA lot of Canadians lost all their Bitcoin on this Quad exchange,‚Äù Krueger noted. Are ‚ÄúETF Paper Bitcoin‚Äù Real? These historical events have contributed to the current apprehension about ETFs and the possibility that they might be engaging in similar practices‚Äîselling Bitcoin they do not actually hold, thereby suppressing BTC‚Äôs price through artificial supply. However, Krueger argued that ETFs, particularly those managed by established financial institutions, operate under a fundamentally different framework compared to unregulated exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Outlook Confirmed By Critical Data ‚Äì STH Overheating? Focusing on two leading ETFs‚ÄîIBIT, the BlackRock ETF, and FBTC, the Fidelity ETF‚ÄîKrueger emphasized the stringent regulatory oversight governing these entities. ‚ÄúBoth of these ETFs are subject to very strict regulatory oversight, including the SEC but also other agencies in the US,‚Äù he stated. This comprehensive oversight includes requirements for complete transparency, regular audits, and the use of third-party custodians for asset verification. ‚ÄúThey literally have to get a receipt of an asset from a third-party custodian,‚Äù Krueger added. In the case of IBIT, Coinbase serves as the third-party custodian. ‚ÄúCoinbase is itself a public company that is audited,‚Äù Krueger pointed out, noting that the public nature of Coinbase adds an additional layer of scrutiny and accountability. IBIT conducts audits of Coinbase, and both entities are subject to audits by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. For FBTC, custody is handled by Fidelity Digital Assets, a separate entity within Fidelity that specializes in the custody of digital assets, thereby ensuring specialized oversight and management. ‚ÄúThe issuers of IBIT and FBTC are BlackRock and Fidelity, two of the largest and oldest financial institutions, and they have a vested interest in maintaining their reputation,‚Äù Krueger asserted. ‚ÄúTheir reputation is at stake, and this is a big deal,‚Äù he emphasized, suggesting that these institutions would not risk their credibility by engaging in the sale of non-existent Bitcoin. Krueger contrasted BlackRock with entities like QuadrigaCX to underscore the disparity in regulatory compliance and operational scale. ‚ÄúBlackRock is highly regulated BlackRock has a robust corporate governance structure with committees for audit, risk, and compliance and very extensive internal controls,‚Äù Krueger added. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $125,000 By Year-End If Trump Wins, Says Standard Chartered Addressing the core concern about ETFs holding ‚Äúpaper Bitcoin,‚Äù Krueger provided specific data to refute this notion. ‚ÄúThe reality is the ETFs have zero pure paper Bitcoin,‚Äù he stated unequivocally. He highlighted that IBIT holds approximately 403,000 actual Bitcoins, while FBTC holds about 185,000 actual Bitcoins. ‚ÄúTogether, these two ETFs hold almost 3% of the world‚Äôs total Bitcoin, or 588,000 Bitcoins‚ÄîI think it‚Äôs 2.9%,‚Äù he calculated. Krueger acknowledged that some skeptics have attempted to analyze Bitcoin movement between specific dates to challenge these holdings. However, he emphasized that the facts are clear and verifiable. ‚ÄúWe know how much Bitcoin these ETFs have; we know that it‚Äôs accounted for, and that‚Äôs a reality,‚Äù he insisted. Turning to the question of why Bitcoin‚Äôs price has not increased more dramatically despite significant ETF inflows, Krueger offered a nuanced explanation. He noted that Bitcoin is, in fact, up by 60% since the introduction of the ETFs, translating to a $600 billion increase in market capitalization. This growth has been fueled by approximately $20 billion in net inflows into the ETFs, resulting in a price multiplier effect of about 30x. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs historically about normal, maybe a little on the low side but not terribly so,‚Äù he assessed. Krueger attributed the moderation in Bitcoin‚Äôs price growth to substantial selling pressures from various sources. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a bunch of selling,‚Äù he explained. He detailed that Germany sold $3 billion worth of Bitcoin as well as Mt. Gox holdings. Additionally, FTX sold its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) stake earlier in the year, and the Digital Currency Group (DCG) sold assets to resolve lawsuits. ‚ÄúWe had a lot of selling,‚Äù Krueger summarized. Speculating on the potential impact absent these selling pressures, Krueger suggested that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could have been significantly higher. ‚ÄúWe probably would be at $90k if there wasn‚Äôt any selling,‚Äù he posited. At press time, BTC traded at $68,752.

It remains about 5% below its record high around $73,700 from early March of this year.  Rate cutting cycles among most major economies, renewed big inflows into the spot ETFs and rising betting market odds of a Trump victory next week are among the catalysts for the recent run higher.  After an excruciating (for the bulls) more than seven months of sideways to lower price action, bitcoin {{BTC}} appears set for another challenge of its all-time high of roughly $73,700 hit in early March.  Following what is now looking like a final washout plunge in the opening days of September that brought the price down to the $53,000 area, bitcoin has mostly been in rally mode since and finally took out the $70,000 level minutes ago.  A fresh rate-cutting cycle from the major Western central banks (except the Bank of Japan) combined with sizable monetary and fiscal stimulus out of China may or may not be the key catalysts for this latest bull move. Also possibly at play are renewed big inflows into the U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs and the surge in prediction markets for the presidential election chances of crypto-friendly GOP candidate Donald Trump.  The days ahead are likely to be busy ones, including what promises to be a frenzied end to the U.S. election season, the election itself on Nov. 5, a Federal Reserve rate decision on Nov. 6 and the U.S. October employment report on Nov. 8.

35257808,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650240,1730149229,Dogecoin Poised For $0.1491 Breakout As RSI Reveals Bullish Potential,"Dogecoin is showing strong signs of a potential breakout, with technical indicators aligning for a possible move toward the $0.1491 mark. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has shifted into bullish territory, signaling growing momentum and showing that further gains could be on the horizon. This uptick in RSI suggests that buyer confidence is strengthening, setting Dogecoin up for a significant upward push. This analysis aims to explore Dogecoin‚Äôs bullish potential as it approaches a key resistance level at $0.1491. It will provide insights into the increasing buying interest and the possibility of an upward breakout, examining the recent shift in the RSI and other technical indicators. RSI Signals Growing Bullish Sentiment For Dogecoin Following the recent recovery at $0.1293, DOGE‚Äôs price on the 4-hour chart has continued to gain pressure, approaching $0.1491 while aiming to break past it. DOGE is also trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), suggesting a positive upward trend that could lead to a possible breakout. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates potential for further upward movement, with the RSI rebounding to the 62% level after a previous dip to 34%. As the RSI continues to rise, traders are increasingly optimistic about the asset‚Äôs future performance. If this upside momentum persists, it could pave the way for a significant price increase, possibly challenging key resistance levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Poised for Another Rise: Can Bulls Drive Higher? Also, on the daily chart, Dogecoin has shown strong upside movement, reflected in multiple positive candlesticks following a successful rebound at $0.1293 as it continues to trade above the 100-day SMA. Trading above the 100-day SMA not only suggests that Dogecoin is in a bullish phase but also signifies that previous resistance levels may now serve as support, providing a safety net for future price movements. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a detailed examination of the RSI formation indicates renewed upbeat strength for DOGE as the indicator‚Äòs signal line has risen again to 64% after dropping to 57%, suggesting a sustained optimistic outlook. Potential Upside Targets: What Lies Beyond $0.1491? As Dogecoin nears the $0.1491 resistance level, attention turns to potential upside targets in the event of a breakout. If DOGE successfully breaks through this key threshold, the next significant target could be approximately $0.1649, where historical resistance may come into play. Should the bullish momentum persist and overcome this level, DOGE could advance to test even higher price levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Flashes Bullish Pennant On Daily Heikin Ashi Chart, What This Means However, if the meme coin fails to sustain its upward strength, DOGE may retrace to the previous support level of $0.1293. When this level is breached, it could trigger additional declines, which could lead to a drop toward $0.0914 and other lower price ranges.

From time to time, participants must opt in to a modification to these rules, known as ‚Äúhard fork,‚Äù or else remain on a legacy version of the network.  With a change in administration forthcoming, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has an opportunity to institute a hard fork of its own with respect to its approach to crypto regulation. Although legislation is necessary to establish a fulsome legal framework for crypto, the SEC can abandon its regulation-by-enforcement playbook in favor of a pro-innovation regulatory framework that scales to accommodate novel markets.  We need a hard fork in crypto regulation to address four key pain points:  Issuance  Every offer or sale of a security must be registered with the SEC, absent an exemption. This raises two problems for crypto asset issuers. First, it is unclear whether any given crypto asset is a security. Second, the current registration process and issuer-specific exemptions are onerous and incompatible with the characteristics of many crypto asset offerings.  The term ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù is defined to include, among other things, any stock, note, bond or investment contract. Federal courts have consistently held that crypto assets, in and of themselves, are not securities, but may be sold as the object of an investment contract security. Of course, instruments such as common stock and warrants are securities whether issued in tokenized form or not. But the most widely traded crypto assets more closely resemble currencies, trading cards and other commodities that ordinarily fall outside of the security definition.  Issuers of crypto assets have addressed the risk of inadvertently violating the registration requirement by relying on various registration exemptions when engaging in offerings of crypto assets that may constitute investment contracts. However, the SEC has sued many such issuers for alleged violations of the registration requirement under the theory that the crypto assets sold as the object of an investment contract inherit the investment contract‚Äôs security status. There is no legal precedent to support this viral theory of security status, which would make many ordinary commodities sold in the stream of commerce into securities.  A new administration can eliminate this regulatory friction for issuers by clarifying that crypto assets sold as the object of an investment contract that do not independently qualify as a security are not subject to the registration requirement.  Issuers of crypto assets that do meet the definition of a security today face the false choice of filing a registration statement or relying upon an exemption from registration. Although SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that such issuers need only fill out ‚Äúa form on our website,‚Äù the registration process is designed for massive companies under centralized management seeking to go public rather than teams of software developers intending to exit to a decentralized community. The SEC should evaluate whether reforms to the registration process are necessary and appropriate to accommodate crypto asset issuers, as it has done in the past for asset-backed security issuers.  Additionally, the SEC has broad authority to exempt certain activities, products and transactions from the registration requirement if necessary or appropriate in the public interest. It should use this authority to propose additional registration exemptions for crypto-native methods of distribution, such as offerings to technologically sophisticated protocol users, validator operators, play-to-earn gamers and testnet participants.  Finally, the SEC should propose a ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù from the registration requirement for airdrops. It is well-understood that a distribution of a security is not a ‚Äúsale‚Äù if the recipient of the security does not individually bargain to contribute cash or other tangible or definable consideration to the distributor in exchange for the security. However, the SEC has nonetheless characterized airdrops as subject to the registration requirement. The SEC should codify certain conditions that airdrops can satisfy to be safe harbored from constituting ‚Äúsales.‚Äù  Staking  Users of proof-of-stake blockchain networks can commit their crypto assets as stake to help secure the network and earn rewards in accordance with its consensus mechanism. Many such users choose to do so by retaining a staking-as-a-service provider or using a liquid staking protocol. However, the SEC maintains that these staking arrangements constitute investment contract securities subject to registration.  While many of these staking offerings arguably constitute technical services rather than investment contracts, the SEC should establish a registration exemption for offers and sales of any staking services that constitute securities to assure that users of proof-of-stake blockchains are able to access these vital services.  Custody  The diversity of participants in the crypto markets require a broad range of custodial solutions. Crypto hobbyists tend to prefer to use non-custodial digital wallet software, whereas financial institutions are more likely to retain a custodial digital wallet provider. However, the SEC has made it challenging for industry participants to access both types of custodial solutions.  The agency has brought lawsuits against the developers of some of the most popular non-custodial software products asserting that these developers are brokering transactions in securities. Additionally, the SEC issued a staff accounting bulletin that effectively requires public companies offering crypto asset custody services to report the custodied crypto assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. As a result, many custodial banks have opted not to offer crypto asset custodial services because they would be subject to adverse regulatory capital treatment with respect to these assets.  At the same time, the SEC has prohibited broker-dealers from offering custodial services for crypto assets, unless they qualify as a ‚Äúspecial-purpose‚Äù broker-dealer and forego offering custodial services for traditional securities and non-security crypto assets. Further, the SEC has opined in a recent proposed rulemaking that registered investment advisers must always custody client crypto assets with a qualified custodian because such assets constitute ‚Äúfunds‚Äù or ‚Äúsecurities‚Äù under the agency‚Äôs custody rule.  The SEC can immediately remove these barriers for crypto custodial solutions by withdrawing the staff accounting bulletin, its lawsuits against non-custodial digital wallet software providers and its ‚Äúspecial-purpose‚Äù broker-dealer restrictions. Moreover, the agency can propose new amendments to the custody rule to clarify which, if any, crypto assets qualify as ‚Äúfunds‚Äù and establish reasonable exceptions from the qualified custody requirement, such as for staking and exchange trading.  Trading  Operators and developers of crypto asset trading venues face three core challenges.  First, it is unclear whether crypto assets initially sold as the object of an investment contract are themselves securities that can only be listed for trading on SEC-registered platforms.  Second, the registration requirements for securities exchanges are incompatible with the way that centralized and decentralized crypto trading venues currently operate.  Third, SEC-registered exchanges can only list registered securities, but most crypto assets in circulation today were never registered with the SEC. Despite these frictions, the SEC has failed to offer industry guidance and instead brought lawsuits against multiple crypto asset trading venue providers for registration violations.  Additionally, people who purchase and sell crypto assets in secondary markets must navigate a legal minefield. While federal securities laws include a general exemption from the registration requirement for offers and sales of securities by a person other than an issuer, underwriter or dealer, the SEC has asserted that many purchasers of crypto assets are underwriters and dealers.  The SEC can immediately withdraw its lawsuits against crypto asset trading venue providers, which are driven by an anti-innovation policy agenda rather than an investor protection mandate. Instead, the agency should propose modifications to its exchange registration requirements to accommodate crypto trading venues, including reasonable exceptions to the restriction on listing unregistered securities. The SEC should also evaluate the merits of deeming crypto asset securities that satisfy enumerated conditions to be ‚Äúexempt securities‚Äù that are excused from certain secondary trading restrictions.  It should also withdraw its recently proposed amendments to the ‚Äúexchange‚Äù definition and recently finalized amendments to the ‚Äúdealer‚Äù definition, each of which is prejudiced against crypto software protocols. Further, the agency should clarify the application of the Rule 144 safe harbor from underwriter status to crypto assets purchased as part of an investment contract.

BTC advanced 3% over the past 24 hours, changing hands at $69,800, while the CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the performance of 20 large-cap tokens, managed a more modest 1% gain during the same period. Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} was up 0.5%, while native tokens of Polygon (POL), Near {{NEAR}} and Hedera {{HBAR}} dragged the index lower.  It was dogecoin {DOGE}} that defied the broadly lagging altcoin market, surging 10% during the day, as the token attracted trader attention after being mentioned during a Donald Trump campaign event on Sunday.  The largest and oldest market cap canine-themed crypto has been closely associated with Trump lately after Elon Musk, who has been increasingly involved with the Republican candidate's campaign, proposed the ‚ÄúDepartment of Government Efficiency,‚Äù abbreviated to D.O.G.E., focused on reining in U.S. government spending.  Excitement rose a bit further as Musk, following his appearance at the Trump rally, tweeted a meme of himself with the DOGE avatar.  ""It's a play on Trump's popularity,"" Paul Howard, senior director at crypto trading firm Wincent, said in a Telegram message. ""DOGE is now being closely tied to the U.S. presidential outcome by virtue of its popularity with [Elon] Musk.

The crypto action happened as U.S. stock indexes closed the day higher, with the Dow Jones climbingby 0.7%, while the Nasdaq's and the S&P 500 each gained 0.3%.

35255409,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650219,1730143829,"Pepe Battles Price Decline, But Analysts Signal A Potential Rally Ahead","Pepe [PEPE] is currently trading at approximately $0.000000900 and is undergoing a challenging period. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 43.80, which is just below the neutral line. This implies that sellers currently possess a minor advantage. Related Reading: MicroStrategy Stock Hits All-Time High As Bitcoin Blazes Past $67,000 Memecoin Price On The Downtrend Some investors are apprehensive due to the downward trend of the price. Although PEPE has experienced significant price increases in the past, recent metrics suggest that momentum is diminishing. It is interesting that the number of holders is consistently increasing, despite the obstacles. This expanding base, which is now approaching 296,000, indicates that a devoted community continues to support the token. Even if participation has dropped, it is clear that many investors are still committed to the popular meme coin and have future hope. The declining trade activity has raised some questions, though. Active Addresses On The Retreat Active addresses that the PEPE network has seen have dropped significantly, data from Santiment shows; today they count roughly 13.5k. From peak levels recorded earlier this year, this translates to a decline. Lower active numbers of users would typically denote reduced trading volumes and hence decreased liquidity levels. Perhaps, this might indicate that euphoria regarding the memecoin market in the earlier stages is fading away slowly. The niche seekers probably are on a lookout for something new within such a developing memecoin territory. If the same continues then PEPE could struggle to regain its vibrancy. The more cautious sentiment among traders is evident in the subdued price action. Perhaps as a result of the general market‚Äôs uncertainty, certain investors appear to be waiting on the periphery. If the price remains under pressure, it is possible that the coin will experience additional declines before it establishes a strong foundation. Glimmer Of Hope For PEPE Despite the challenges in engagement and the weakness in price, there are rays of hope for PEPE. In the coming three months, analysts expect more than a 200% increase which is a positive indicator of upside potential. Related Reading: Floki Inu Warning: Analyst Says ‚ÄòPrepare For The Crash‚Äô ‚Äì Details CoinCheckup forecasts that in the next month PEPE could be trading 220% lower than its current price. This can be an appropriate time to invest in the asset. The experts are of the opinion that the upcoming months will accrue the investor a total of 165% profits. Nonetheless, in the face of these difficulties, the future developments seem promising and PEPE will soar to $0.00044 by 2026, which may cause renewed interest in the sector as a whole.

ADA recently started a fresh drop below the $0.3550 zone and is now down by about 15% in the past 30 days. This lackluster performance has kept many ADA holders in the red zone, with unrealized losses mounting as the price continues to struggle. As a result, it is only natural for many to keep selling to reduce their losses, which in turn could cause the ADA price to keep falling, at least in the short term. Analyst Says Cardano Price Is Already 80 To 90% Into Correction The current ADA price action is very difficult to deal with, especially for long-term holders who have continued to hold despite the laggard performance. According to an analyst on TradingView, the best way for these ADA holders to keep approaching the ADA price outlook is to keep holding. This is because the drop is already quite advanced and we can say that 80 to 90% of the correction is already over for this pair. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Reach $3 Billion Inflows In October, Retail Investors Lead The Charge ‚Äì Report To put things in perspective, Cardano is currently trading around 56% below its 2024 high of $0.7742, despite broader market rallies seen in September and October. According to crypto analyst Alan Santana on TradingView, ADA appears to be consolidating around the same price levels seen in November 2023, showing limited upward momentum. In comparison, most other large market cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Solana, and BNB are already on their way to retesting their 2024 highs made in the first quarter. Interestingly, there exists a possibility of Cardano dropping lower in the coming months, especially if Bitcoin were to correct massively. However, as analyst Alan Santana pointed out, Cardano is already almost done with its corrections. As such, a fresh drop in the ADA price wouldn‚Äôt be a super strong drop and would last only a few days or maximum a few weeks. Sustained Long-Term Growth For ADA According to Santana, selling ADA now may not be the best move, especially for those who have held throughout the corrections. This is because prices are already really low for ADA, and is already in the accumulation zone. As such, a prudent action would be to focus on the long term and wait until the next bull market enters in full swing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stock To Flow Model Shows Price Is Ready For Next Phase Transition Above $100,000 Santana‚Äôs price projection for ADA suggests that while another slight drop could occur, it would likely be followed by a gradual recovery from November 2024 to February 2025, with a more significant bullish phase expected to gain momentum by March 2025. By that point, Santana forecasts a potential return for ADA above $0.70, representing a 130% increase from its current price levels. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.3371, having increased by about 1.25% in the past 24 hours.

42373473,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmVpF,1730136565,Hong Kong SFC to Establish ‚ÄòConsultative Panel‚Äô for Licensed Crypto Exchanges,"The SFC‚Äôs Eric Yip said the panel will include representatives from each licensed exchange.  He expects the panel to develop a roadmap for crypto products and services.  The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) plans to create a consultative panel for licensed cryptocurrency exchanges in the city next year, said Eric Yip, the SFC‚Äôs Executive Director, Intermediaries.  Speaking at Hong Kong Fintech Week on Oct. 28, Yip said the panel will include representatives from each licensed exchange and would build community transparency and shared responsibility among licensees.  ‚ÄúWe expect the panel deliberation will result in a comprehensive virtual assets white paper that outlines the development roadmap for products and services, as well as potential enhancement in compliance and risk management,‚Äù he said.  The move will be part of the city‚Äôs effort to establish a comprehensive framework for digital assets, which includes upcoming legislation for OTC trading and stablecoins.  Earlier this year, Hong Kong brought in a new licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms. Three are currently licensed in the city and Yip said the SFC was currently processing the application of another 14, 11 of which have pre-existing businesses in Hong Kong. He added that he expected more licenses to be granted by the end of this year.  But Yip also cautioned that while virtual assets were at the forefront of the agenda for financial regulators globally, investors still need to be protected through regulation and education.  Read more Consensus Hong Kong-related coverage here.  In the first half of this year, HK$1.5 billion ($193 million) was lost to investment fraud in the city, while fraud and scams accounted for almost half of reported crimes, according to a police statement. It did not publish results on how many of these cases involved cryptocurrency but figures from 2023 show that crypto-related fraud accounted for more than half of investment fraud losses.  ‚ÄúAt the SFC, we firmly believe the future of virtual assets lies in a regulated marketplace that balances its development with investor protection. We do not need to reinvent too many wheels, as our experience in securities regulation lays a strong foundation,‚Äù Yip said.  He called for greater cooperation between different regulators around the world to prevent exchanges from playing ‚Äúregulatory arbitrage‚Äù.  Yet it is proving to be a challenge. Some of the biggest exchanges globally have dropped out of the Hong Kong licensing application process, including OKX, HTX and a local Binance-backed exchange.  The small amount of tokens available on licensed exchanges and the lack of complex financial products mean retail traders are continuing to use overseas exchanges not licensed in Hong Kong. Without mentioning this issue explicitly, Yip said that regulators needed to stay on their toes to keep up.  ‚ÄúIf virtual asset liquidity still resides in unregulated VATPs after all our efforts, and regulated entities cannot operate a sustainable business model, then we need to reflect on why investors didn't pick our state-of-the-art regulatory framework,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúIn short, we need to listen to the market and balance between regulatory perfection and market development.‚Äù  This series is brought to you by Consensus Hong Kong.

USDT's role in illicit finance is a ""drop in the ocean"" compared to the U.S. dollar's, he added.  The company ""doesn't expect any political favors by anyone,"" he said of Howard Lutnick's role in Donald Trump's campaign.  A WSJ report Friday said Tether is under U.S. criminal investigation, which the company denied.  LUGANO, SWITZERLAND ‚Äì As crypto colossus Tether comes under renewed scrutiny, CEO Paolo Ardoino told CoinDesk that the company respects international sanctions and works closely with law enforcement, but acknowledged it is ultimately at the mercy of U.S. authorities.  ""If the U.S. wanted to kill us, they can press a button and kill us anywhere,"" Ardoino said. ""We are not going to fight the U.S.""  ""We may not be the best in presenting ourselves, but what matters is that we onboarded the FBI"" to Tether's compliance systems, he added. ""We onboarded the U.S. Secret Service. We have thank-you letters from the DOJ ‚Ä¶ We think we are doing, you know, the best we can.""  CoinDesk interviewed Ardoino at the Plan B conference on Friday hours before The Wall Street Journal published an article alleging that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is conducting a criminal investigation of Tether for possible violations of sanctions and anti-money-laundering laws. Bitcoin {{BTC}} and other cryptos dipped on the report.  Ardoino later posted on X he had seen ""no indication that Tether is under investigation,"" and Tether called the Journal story ""wildly irresponsible.""  Also last week, Politico reported on potential conflicting interests of key Tether ally Howard Lutnick, CEO of Wall Street bond-trading powerhouse Cantor Fitzgerald, which custodies most of Tether's $80 billion U.S. Treasury bill holdings. Lutnick also serves as the head of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's transition team.  Tether coming into the crosshairs of U.S. authorities could reverberate across the $2 trillion global digital asset market. The company is a crucial player in the crypto ecosystem; its $120 billion market cap {{USDT}} by far the industry's largest stablecoin, serves as the main form of liquidity on trading venues, and is increasingly used as a payment vehicle in emerging countries.  Cantor and Tether  When asked about the possibility of U.S. authorities holding leverage over Tether through its reserve assets held with the U.S.-based Cantor, Ardoino said that the company ""cannot hide.""  ""Wherever you hold T-bills, the T-bills are actually ultimately in the Fed account."" he said, referring to the Federal Reserve system.  ""The reason why I'm comfortable to be with Cantor is that we respect OFAC."" The Office of Foreign Assets Control is an office in the U.S. Treasury Department tasked with enforcing sanctions against countries and individuals, including terrorists and narcotics traffickers.  Asked about USDT's role in illicit finance, Ardoino replied that it's ""a drop in the ocean"" compared to what the U.S. dollar used for.  ""No one is perfect, but look at the fines that the banks paid for helping drug lords,"" he said. For example, TD Bank this month agreed to pay over $3 billion in fines for failing to properly monitor money laundering by drug cartels.  Ardoino said that Tether has been proactive in freezing and blacklisting crypto wallets and the company works with 180 government agencies around the world.  ""The message that we're giving is very loud and clear: You have to be a very, very, very stupid criminal if you want to use USDT or crypto in general,"" he said.  U.S. Elections  Speaking about the upcoming U.S. election's potential ramifications for digital asset regulations and for Tether, Ardoino said that he's hopeful that whoever wins will understand the potential of crypto and stablecoins.  ""When it comes to stablecoins, I think it's easier for them to see it,"" he said. ""The Chinese are selling T-bills and we are buying them now. I think the U.S. government and regulators came to the conclusion that, 'oh yeah, that's a great thing.'""  Tether's U.S Treasury holdings rank the company among top 20 countries, topping even those of Germany.  Asked about Cantor Fitzgerald and Howard Lutnick's political role, Ardoino said working with him was part of Tether's four-year journey from a $10 billion issuer using small banks to a large operation that needs an ""Ivy League custodian"" for its T-bill holdings.  ""What made the difference was Howard [Lutnick] publicly affirming that his firm had done due diligence on Tether and telling everyone 'we have their money,'"" he said.  ""We don't expect any political favors by anyone,"" Ardoino said. He said that Tether has made significant efforts to advance financial inclusion, and ""Democrats should understand the need for financial inclusion better than anyone else.""  Meanwhile, the company is a big buyer of U.S. debt, which should be compelling to Republicans interested in preserving the U.S. dollar's hegemony.  ""What we're building makes sense for both parties,"" he concluded.

The other proposed new candidates for tax concessions are immovable property situated outside Hong Kong, emission derivatives/allowance, insurance linked securities, interest in non-corporate private entities and loans and private credit investments.

42407342,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGWsv,1730135281,FTX's $228M Settlement With Bybit Brings Conclusion of Epic Liquidation Closer,"The FTX bankruptcy checked off another major cash settlement, this time for more than $200 million from crypto exchange Bybit.  The influx of cash will serve the already-approved FTX dispersal plan in which the recovery of as much as $16.3 billion is soon heading toward former customers and creditors.  The costly meltdown of global exchange FTX is still settling big chunks of its bankruptcy drama, now securing about $228 million from Bybit to further feed the cash dispersal that was approved in court earlier this month.  In its latest settlement, FTX is recovering $175 million in assets held in Bybit accounts and an agreement that Bybit would purchase the FTX debtors' BIT tokens for about $53 million. The latter ""allows the Debtors to recover significant value for their illiquid and difficult-to-monetize holdings of a volatile asset,"" the settlement noted.  The FTX estate had originally sought $953 million from Bybit when it first sued the crypto exchange almost a year ago, trying to claw back what it characterized as ""misappropriated funds"" in the days before FTX collapsed.  On October 7, the federal bankruptcy court approved a final plan for closing out the recovery, estimating repayments to former FTX customers and creditors at an average of 118% (and in some cases much more) of what they held when the company filed for bankruptcy in November of 2022. While that number seems high, crypto assets have jumped dramatically in price while that money was locked up ‚Äì in the case of bitcoin, for instance, {{BTC}} has moved up 304%. Creditors will not see those gains.  The cash payouts were meant to happen ""within 60 days,"" FTX said.  Last year, the FTX liquidators also struck a deal with Genesis to get $175 million ‚Äì much less than the $4 billion it was originally after.  ""We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,"" the bankrupt FTX's liquidation CEO John Ray said in a statement when the final plan, which was based on a recovery of as much as $16.3 billion in assets, was announced in May.

35250548,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650234,1730133051,If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‚ÄòWe Could See A 25% Rally‚Äô ‚Äì Top Analyst,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has been trading below a key resistance level at $0.143 since October 19, and anticipation is building among investors who believe a breakout may be imminent. The popular memecoin has remained relatively steady, yet this critical level has prevented DOGE from moving significantly higher. Top analyst and investor Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the potential for a strong rally once DOGE clears this barrier. According to Martinez, a break above the $0.143 mark could trigger a rapid 25% rally, propelling Dogecoin to fresh highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Outlook Confirmed By Critical Data ‚Äì STH Overheating? As market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, all eyes are on Dogecoin‚Äôs performance in the coming days. Investors and traders are watching closely, expecting a decisive move that could set the stage for Dogecoin‚Äôs next trend. With the entire crypto market poised for potential shifts, it could be crucial for DOGE to regain momentum. The outcome of this resistance test will likely play a key role in shaping Dogecoin‚Äôs path forward, especially if it ignites renewed interest and buying pressure across the market. Dogecoin Price Starting To Rise Dogecoin is showing renewed strength following a week marked by volatile price action, which included a pullback from a recent local high at $0.149. Now trading near a key resistance level at $0.143, Dogecoin is capturing attention across the market. Prominent analyst Ali Martinez shared a detailed technical analysis on X, suggesting that if DOGE successfully breaks through this resistance, it could trigger a notable 25% rally, pushing the price up to the $0.175 mark. According to Martinez, the $0.143 threshold is crucial for Dogecoin‚Äôs short-term trajectory, acting as a potential launchpad for further gains. Currently, Dogecoin is testing this pivotal level, and market sentiment is growing optimistic about a breakout, especially as other assets signal readiness for upward movement. The next few days will be critical, with analysts expecting potential bullish momentum across the crypto market that could support DOGE in surging higher. Related Reading: Solana Bullish Pattern Holds ‚Äì Crypto Analyst Sets $202 Target However, should Dogecoin fail to surpass the $0.143 resistance, a period of retracement would likely be necessary to locate lower demand and restore liquidity for the next leg up. A pullback to gather momentum could provide the foundation needed to reattempt a breakout, positioning DOGE for further gains once market conditions align. As Dogecoin teeters on this critical threshold, it‚Äôs clear that the outcome of this resistance test will be instrumental in setting the tone for its price action in the near term. DOGE Technical Levels To Watch DOGE is trading at $0.143 after a minor rally from recent lows at $0.127. This level has proven to be a significant resistance point, as DOGE faces challenges in breaking above it. The overall market is signaling potential upward momentum, but for DOGE to maintain its bullish trajectory, it must decisively break past this $0.143 threshold in the coming hours. Successfully doing so would solidify support for a continued rally, potentially driving the price higher in the short term. However, a retracement would likely be necessary if Dogecoin struggles to hold above this resistance. In this case, a dip to a lower demand level around $0.12 could provide the necessary liquidity to reignite buying interest and gather momentum for a subsequent push. This demand zone has previously acted as strong support and could be the fuel DOGE needs to sustain its bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Outlook Confirmed By Critical Data ‚Äì STH Overheating? As Dogecoin tests these critical levels, traders closely monitor its movements to gauge whether it can break through resistance or if a temporary pullback is on the horizon.

The project is among those aiming to decentralize blockchain ""sequencers"" ‚Äì the component of a layer-2 network that compiles transactions happening on the secondary network, in order to record them on a main layer-1 blockchain, like Ethereum. Metis, a layer-2 network for Ethereum, has developed its own decentralized sequencer, for example.  But Astria's sequencing layer could be used like a modular plug-in for other networks, as an alternative to a centralized sequencer ‚Äì sometimes seen as a bottleneck, or a single point of failure, or potentially a vector of transaction censorship. Almost all layer-2 networks in operation today use a centralized sequencer, including Coinbase's Base, which reportedly produces millions of dollars in revenue for the parent company.  ""With today‚Äôs mainnet launch, we‚Äôve made a significant step towards our vision of once again making decentralization the norm in crypto,"" Astria said.  The project, which raised $5.5 million in April 2023 from investors including 1kx, Delphi Ventures and Figment Capital, was originally conceived as an attempt to build a settlement layer for native rollup networks on the data-availability network Celestia, according to a press release.  ""Over time, we realized that settlement wasn‚Äôt the only piece missing from the modular ecosystem,"" according to the release. ""Developers needed a way to provide fast confirmations to their users, without relying on centralized sequencers like rollups in other ecosystems.""  It could work on both the Ethereum-compatible EVM environment for smart-contract programming, as well as Solana's SVM environment.  Astria says its setup represents a ""a single, permissionless network that can be shared by many rollups, providing both settlement (ie. bridging) and decentralized sequencing, with fast (~2s) block times, and single slot finality.""  Astria is an ""unapologetically Celestia first project, and wouldn‚Äôt exist without the support of Celestia Labs, foundation and the broader Celestia ecosystem,"" according to the release.  The Astria mainnet alpha uses Celestia‚Äôs token (TIA), and data is posted to Celestia.

42373496,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmhRb,1730131200,Prediction Market Kalshi to Supply Price Data for Crypto Oracle Stork,"Prediction market platform Kalshi has agreed to supply price feeds to blockchain oracle service Stork.  Initially, the companies expect the data to power perpetual futures contracts tied to prediction markets.  Eventually, Kalshi believes it could act as a referee for decentralized prediction markets, making final calls on whether predictions came true.  Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated, centralized prediction market platform and late entrant to this year's election betting boom, is building further ties with the cryptocurrency industry.  The company has agreed to supply price feeds to Stork Labs' network of oracle services that send data from the outside world to blockchains and decentralized exchanges. This will let developers build crypto applications informed by Kalshi's markets, where traders bet dollars on everything from the presidential race to American students' average reading and math test scores.  Separately, Kalshi has started accepting deposits of USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades 1:1 for U.S. dollars, Fortune reported.  The tie-up with Stork is another sign of growing enthusiasm, in crypto and adjacent circles, for prediction markets following the breakout success of Polymarket, whose crypto-based platform has seen billions in trading volume this year, largely on the election. On Monday, U.S. stock brokerage giant Robinhood introduced presidential election contracts.  Initially, the companies, both based in New York, expect Stork's ""data consumers"" to incorporate Kalshi's feeds into perpetual futures, a type of derivative contract that has no expiration date. Historically, ""perps"" have mostly been leveraged bets on cryptocurrency prices, but Kalshi's data will enable such derivatives on the probabilities of a wide range of real-world events.  ""The first set of requests that we started to hear at Stork around getting data directly from prediction markets was specifically from perpetual exchanges,"" said Meredith Pitkoff, founder of Stork Labs (not to be confused with the biomedical robotics startup of the same name). ""There's a new trend where these decentralized exchanges want to list perp contracts on these prediction markets.""  dYdx and Vega are among the DEXs that have announced such plans in recent months.  Down the road, Kalshi envisions providing resolution services for decentralized prediction markets through Stork's network, making the final call on whether a prediction came true or not.  ""There are a lot of problems with resolution and how that works on on-chain markets, not just the user experience with disputes and stuff like that,"" said Jack Such, Kalshi's head of market research. ""If a prediction market protocol isn't sufficiently decentralized, it's vulnerable to capture.""  If, for example, an oracle service settles disputes by a vote of token holders and a group of them collude, ""they can just choose to resolve markets however they want and pay themselves out with everyone's money,"" Such said. ""It's really, really difficult and a long process to achieve sufficient decentralization in that regard.""  Being regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission gives Kalshi ""a unique advantage"" as a resolution provider, he said, because it faces ""legal consequences"" if it does anything suspicious with its resolution criteria. The company has ""an incentive"" to adjudicate matters fairly.  At least to start, Kalshi is providing the data to Stork's network for free. Ultimately, Such said, the arrangement could be a way to sign up more traders for its own, centralized platform, which does business only in the U.S.  ""We're kind of hoping that a lot of these protocols that try to spin a prediction market using our data will eventually realize that it might be easier, assuming they're Americans and allowed to trade on Kalshi, to just come trade on Kalshi,"" he said. Noting that Wall Street heavyweight Susquehanna is trading on the platform, Such added, ""liquidity will never be an issue for us.""  It remains an open question whether prediction markets can sustain their popularity after the election. Pitkoff said Stork is ""talking to a lot of projects that are interested in making it a social experience"" where small circles of friends could spin up prediction markets for themselves.

The university has seemingly become the first endowment to invest in the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds.  Add Atlanta-based Emory University to the list of institutional investors taking a shine to bitcoin {{BTC}}.  The university disclosed ownership of more than $15 million worth of shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), according to a Friday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to a top ETF analyst, the announcement marks the first endowment to publicly report exposure to bitcoin.  Emory also reported holding 4,312 shares of Coinbase, valued at $922,639 as of press time. The university's total assets stood at $21 billion as of August 2023, according to its most recent annual report.  Endowments are created to fund non-profit institutions like hospitals, churches or universities. Up until now, it appears no other endowment has previously publicly reported a bitcoin ETF position, according to Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.  Similar to pension funds, endowment funds prefer a risk-averse approach to their investments, making Emory‚Äôs allocation into a bitcoin ETF notable.  Pension funds, such as the State of Wisconsin, have previously reported holdings of the bitcoin ETFs. Additionally, the municipal pension plan of Jersey City, New Jersey, announced that it would allocate 2% of its assets into the ETFs.  Grayscale‚Äôs mini BTC fund launched much later than its counterparts, after the asset manager‚Äôs flagship bitcoin trust (GBTC), bled large amounts of assets largely due to its relatively high fee of 1.5%.

42373499,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmhmd,1730130900,An Arctic Circle Bitcoin Mine Will Heat a Building in a Fishing Village,"Sazmining is setting up a bitcoin (BTC) mining site in northern Norway that will heat a large building in a fishing village.  The firm's CEO, Kent Halliburton, told CoinDesk that other local businesses might spin up similar facilities.  The miner doesn't foresee regulatory scrutiny, despite the country's previous restrictions on bitcoin mining.  A bitcoin {{BTC}} mine is coming to the Arctic Circle.  The 350-square-meter facility, conceived by retail-oriented bitcoin mining firm Sazmining, will be located in a small fishing village on the coast of Norway. Once it goes live on Dec. 1, it may well become the northernmost mining operation in the world.  The big idea? To remove the old oil boiler used by one of the town's largest buildings, replace it with an in-house bitcoin-centric data center and warm the edifice using the tremendous heat produced by the mining rigs.  ""Heat is a really critical resource in this region of the world,"" Kent Halliburton, the CEO of Sazmining, told CoinDesk in an interview. ""It's minus 20 degrees Celsius for large portions of the year. ‚Ä¶ A portion of the heat [from the machines] is actually going to be shunted off to dry fish, which is part of the economy there.""  While Halliburton did not wish to publicize the facility's exact location before it went live, he said the project aimed to showcase the possibilities offered by bitcoin mining to other Arctic residents.  ""For the locals, it's kind of like, you need to see it to believe it,"" Halliburton said. ""This will be helpful for them to understand that it's not bleeding edge technology, but it's pretty tested and it can be deployed now.""  ""There are multiple business owners in the community already considering this approach,"" he added.  How the Arctic bitcoin mine works  Mining rigs are designed to perform intense computational processes, and they get quite hot. There are a few ways to cool them down, such as with fans or by immersing them in big tubs of dielectric fluid.  Sazmining's operation ‚Äì which will have 2.6 megawatts (MW) of total energy capacity ‚Äì will use a different method: running coolant into the machines themselves through small channels that absorb the heat, then extract it and push it out to the rest of the building.  The set-up comes with unique infrastructural challenges. For example, the firm needs to make sure not to generate too much heat and make people in the building uncomfortable, Halliburton said, which is why the miner, quite paradoxically, had to also install a dry cooler on top of the building to help regulate the temperature.  But it does come with perks, too. Liquid cooling means the machines will be very quiet and won't bother anyone in the building. Visitors will be able to see the mining rigs through a plexiglass wall, Halliburton said.  It's not the first operation looking to recycle the heat produced by its own mining machines. There's a spa in Manhattan that uses a similar process for its swimming pools, and it's not unheard of for solo miners to warm up their apartments or greenhouses this way, either.  Win-win?  Sazmining has two other mining locations: one in the U.S. state of Wisconsin and another in Paraguay. The firm's business model involves allowing retail investors to buy their own mining rigs and let Sazmining operate them in a carbon-neutral fashion for a 15% share of one's block rewards, according to the company's website.  The Norwegian project wasn't really conceived as an experiment, Halliburton said. Mining has become incredibly competitive in the wake of the fourth Bitcoin halving (which cut mining profitability by 50%), and the deal simply made economic sense for both parties involved.  ""The building is paying us for the heat instead of having to pay for oil for the boiler,"" he said. Norway's abundance of hydropower means that electricity is very cheap, and that the mining operation will be running almost completely on green energy.  In fact, with a service fee of $0.046 per kilowatt hour, Sazmining clients should be able to acquire bitcoin for less than $54,000, Halliburton said. For comparison, B Riley Securities recently said that the estimated average power costs for the sector is around $0.045 per kilowatt-hour. (Bitcoin's price is currently just below $70,000.)  ""There's just this excess thing that we can turn into money,"" he said. ""Basically, we're using an electron to hash [mine bitcoin], but we can use that same electron to heat the place. You get two uses for the same electron.""  However, it remains to be seen if everyone else in the nation feels as positive about it. Norwegian lawmakers moved earlier this year to put restrictions on bitcoin mining as part of an effort to provide a proper regulatory framework for data centers of all kinds.  Bitcoin mining ""is associated with large greenhouse-gas emissions and is an example of a type of business we do not want in Norway,"" Terje Aasland, the country's minister of energy, reportedly said.  But Halliburton says the Norwegian government is simply undergoing an education process, and Sazmining's facility is meant to help showcase the benefits of bitcoin mining.  ""Because our data center is heating the building, it would be very hard for legislators to justify turning it off since it would jeopardize life in such a cold client during the winter months, so no, we do not see legislation being a problem in the future,"" Halliburton said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MINING | REGULATION,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/28/a-bitcoin-miner-is-setting-up-in-the-arctic-circle-to-heat-up-building-in-fishing-village,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f69cc0392785b1db6d914e14f9229105b6d7e62b-5508x3098.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This pullback highlights the growing influence of the impending US presidential election on near-term prices, where a Republican victory is widely seen as bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin. The correlation between Trump‚Äôs election odds and Bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory has increased. The anticipation around the election has fuelled a surge in options activity. Options expiring on key dates around the election are commanding higher premiums, with implied volatility expected to peak at 100 daily vol on November 8th, just after Election Day ‚Äì indicating that the market is bracing for potential turbulence. Regardless of the election outcome, short-term volatility is expected to be higher than usual though we remain confident in longer-term price appreciation. Despite recent corrections, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience since its September dip to $52,756, rallying 30 percent through October. Seasonality is also on Bitcoin‚Äôs side : Q4 has been consistently bullish in halving years, with a median quarterly return of 31.34 percent. This strong seasonality effect, combined with record-breaking open interest in Bitcoin options and futures, underscores the optimism among market participants heading into the final stretch of the year. Supporting this optimism is the steady build-up in call options for December 27th expiries, with a particular focus on $80,000 strikes. As options open interest climbs to new highs , the market is showing signs of positioning for a post-election surge, potentially propelling Bitcoin towards‚Äîand beyond‚Äîits all-time high of $73,666. In summary, the convergence of election uncertainty, the ‚ÄúTrump trade‚Äù narrative, and favourable Q4 seasonality create a perfect storm for Bitcoin, promising an exciting period ahead regardless of noisy price movements heading into the election in two weeks time. In the broader US economy, the labour market has demonstrated notable resilience in the face of recent natural and industrial disruptions. Initial jobless claims fell to 227,000 last week, despite the challenges posed by Hurricane Milton and an extended strike at aircraft manufacturer, Boeing. Importantly, hurricane-related layoffs in Florida were counterbalanced by declines in jobless claims in other states, highlighting a robust labour environment outside the affected regions. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs Beige Book also characterised employment as ‚Äú stable ,‚Äù with minimal layoffs reported across various sectors. In the housing sector, the US market is currently experiencing a divergence . New home sales surged in September, driven by a temporary decline in mortgage rates. Conversely, existing home sales plummeted to their lowest levels since 2010, largely due to the ‚Äúlock-in effect,‚Äù where homeowners with low-rate mortgages are reluctant to sell and face higher rates on new purchases. Affordability remains a significant hurdle for many first-time buyers as prices continue to remain elevated. While the recent rate relief has stimulated new home sales, a sustained recovery in the housing market will depend on broader mortgage rate stabilisation or potential intervention from the Federal Reserve. Emory University‚Äôs recent investment in digital assets marks a shift toward institutional adoption of crypto . The university disclosed holdings in Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust and Coinbase shares, totalling approximately $15.9 million, signalling an emerging acceptance of digital assets among traditional institutions. Microsoft‚Äôs upcoming shareholder meeting is set to vote on a proposal to explore Bitcoin as a treasury asset. While the board opposes the proposal, citing volatility and regulatory concerns, even a minor allocation from Microsoft‚Äôs $76 billion cash reserves would have a profound impact on legitimising BTC as a corporate asset.

Reality is, it was never looking to break out, thers it much more chance of seeing 30 cent than $7 ‚Äî MXRP (@phoddler) October 22, 2024 He argued that it is more realistic to predict a price hike of $0.30, insisting that a $30 to $35 hike or even an increase of $7 might sound unreal. Hitting $35 Feasible? Maximus remained firm in his bold assumptions about XRP, saying that he is only telling the truth and being honest about a possible breakout for the digital asset. How the fuck is $30-35 a ridiculous target? It‚Äôs the larger measured move $30-35. $7 is the smaller measured move. I‚Äôm a trader with my one long term bag $xrp. We got bent up until breakout. The difference is I‚Äôm honest about it. Missed opportunity is missed opportunity. U Fk. https://t.co/SGXARjCNmt ‚Äî Maximus Prime (@RalstonMax) October 22, 2024 He explained that the target is not ridiculous since the $30 to $35 price target represents the most optimistic outlook or as he describes, ‚ÄúThe larger measured move.‚Äù On the other hand, the price target of $7 is also not irrational because the figure is the conservative assumption for the price rally, adding that the target will remain as a vision until the breakout finally occurs. He also defended that he is a long-term XRP trader and has great confidence in the future of the crypto.

In an X (formerly Twitter) post, the analyst uncovered a distinct technical pattern known as the ‚ÄúBird Beak sign‚Äù in the Bitcoin Heikin AshiBitcoin Heikin Ashi chart, which is a type of candlestick chart used to spot market trend direction and predict future prices. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Flashes Bullish Pennant On Daily Heikin Ashi Chart, What This Means The Bird Beak Sign is a distinct chart pattern that resembles a beak and is created when the Heikin Ashi candlesticks cluster together in a tight consolidated range. Typically when a cryptocurrency consolidates, it means that its price is stabilizing before a potential rally upwards. In the case of Bitcoin, the recent Bird Beak pattern suggests consolidation is preceding an upward momentum. The analyst notes that in the past when Bitcoin showed the Bird Beak sign on the daily Heikin Ashi chart, it was followed by a strong uptrend. This upward movement was represented by multiple green candles, which showed upward movement. Sharing a price chart, Trader Tardigrade disclosed that on 2nd January 2023, a Bird Beak sign had appeared in the Bitcoin chart, triggering a price surge to $23,250 at the time. This same chart pattern was also observed on the 7th and 25th of February, 2024, with Bitcoin skyrocketing to $52,000 and reaching between $71,000 to $72,000, respectively. Trader Tardigrade has revealed that the present Bird Beak sign seen in Bitcoin‚Äôs Heikin Ashi chart formed on 27 October 2024. Based on these past signs, analysts have predicted that the new Bird Beak pattern could lead to another sharp increase for Bitcoin, potentially pushing its price to $114,000 this month. Analyst Expects Bitcoin Price To Hit $71,000 First In a more recent X post, Trader Tardigrade revealed that Bitcoin was breaking out of a Symmetrical Triangle at the tip of its 8-hour Heikin Ashi chart. Based on this new symmetrical triangle pattern, the analyst forecasts that a successful breakout could lead to a rally towards the $71,000 price target for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $24? Analyst Says No One Will Believe It Until It Happens This bullish sentiment is shared by another popular analyst known as the ‚ÄòTitan of Crypto,‚Äô who also projects Bitcoin‚Äôs next target at $71,000.

It‚Äôs important to note that as of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $67,856, marking a 1.3% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,079.56 +2.23%  Bitcoin (BTC): $68,574 +2.37%  Ether (ETH): $2,527.30 +2.58%  S&P 500: 5,808.12 +0.03%  Gold: $2,732.24 -0.63%  Nikkei 225: 38,605.53 +1.82%  Top Stories  Bitcoin returned to $68,500 early in the European morning, continuing its rally that recommenced on Sunday. BTC fell as low as $65,700 late Friday after the - Wall Street Journal reported that the DOJ is probing Tether for violations of sanctions and anti-money laundering rules. Tether quickly denied the report, putting a floor under the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price. Bitcoin erased its losses over the course of the weekend, rising over 2.4% in the last 24 hours to trade at nearly $68,700. ETH and SOL have registered similar gains as the broader crypto market has climbed over 2%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. Memecoin DOGE has enjoyed the healthiest bounce, trading around 6% higher at over $0.145.  MicroStrategy's premium to its BTC stash is unsustainable, according to a research report by Steno Research. The new provision for options on spot bitcoin ETFs will lessen demand for MSTR stock meaning the 300% premium will not last, the report said, adding that during the 2021 bull market, it was below 200% most of the time. MicroStrategy's recent 10:1 stock split's positive effects are also diminishing, analyst Mads Eberhardt wrote. As regulators become more favorable to bitcoin and crypto in general, investors may choose to hold bitcoin directly instead of MicroStrategy stock, according to the report. If Donald Trump is re-elected as president, this regulatory trend is expected to continue.  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will launch a virtual asset index series on Nov. 15. The index will be administered and calculated by CCData, a UK-registered benchmark administrator and virtual asset data and index provider. CCData is owned by CoinDesk. The index series will include a reference index for bitcoin and ether, as well as a reference rate for bitcoin and ether. ""By offering transparent and reliable real-time benchmarks, we seek to enable investors to make informed investment decisions, which will in turn support the development of the virtual asset ecosystem and reinforce Hong Kong's role as an international financial center,‚Äù said HKEX CEO, Bonnie Y Chan.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price and the year-on-year growth in the aggregate M2 money supply of the four major central banks ‚Äì U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, and People's Bank of China.  The M2 grew 7.5% last month, the fastest since November 2021.  BTC's previous bull runs have been characterized by faster growth in the M2.

35243443,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650207,1730116815,Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Best Altcoins For The 2025 Bull Run,"Miles Deutscher, a prominent analyst with 551,000 followers on X, disclosed his portfolio of best altcoins for the anticipated 2025 crypto bull run. In his latest video, ‚ÄúMy NEW Ultimate Crypto Portfolio For The 2025 Bull Run! [MUST-HOLD Altcoins],‚Äù Deutscher provided an in-depth analysis of his selections, emphasizing a strategic concentration on high-conviction investments across diverse sectors. Deutscher began by outlining his approach to portfolio construction, highlighting the importance of limiting core holdings to fifteen altcoins spread across six key sectors: meme coins, artificial intelligence (AI) tokens, infrastructure projects, gaming, real-world assets (RWA), and decentralized finance (DeFi). This structure is designed to enhance focus and manageability, particularly for investors who may not have the time to actively manage a larger number of positions. ‚ÄúBased on the feedback from my community, I believe it‚Äôs better in this market to concentrate into high conviction bets,‚Äù Deutscher stated. Best Altcoins For The 2025 Crypto Bull Run In the meme coin sector, which Deutscher allocates a substantial 25% of his portfolio to, he identified three primary candidates: WIF, PEPE, and SPX. WIF, described as the leading meme coin on the Solana blockchain by Deutscher: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty much the number one Solana kind of beta meme coin. Anons talk about it a lot. It‚Äôs got major exchanges. Coinbase listings being teased coincidentally. It‚Äôs actually at a very nice DCA Zone at the time of recording this video.‚Äù Pepe, an Ethereum-based meme coin, benefits from widespread recognition and strong community distribution. ‚ÄúI do like Pepe because it‚Äôs the leading kind of ETH beta meme coin. It‚Äôs one of the most famous memes in the history of the internet and for that reason I think it commands a lot of mind share,‚Äù Deutscher remarked. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Unveils The ‚ÄòTrue Time To Sell It All‚Äô: Here‚Äôs When SPX6900, endorsed by Murad Mahmudov, a leading figure in the meme coin space, is anticipated to attract substantial retail capital during market upswings. ‚ÄúNumber three is SPX because Murad is the leader of memes. His number one shill and his number one meme holding is SPX, so this is one that I think is going to have momentum as retail comes in,‚Äù Deutscher remarked. Turning to the AI sector, Deutscher also allocates 25% of his portfolio to AI-focused projects, recognizing the burgeoning interest and potential in this field. His top picks include TAO, NEAR, and Spectral. TAO is positioned as the leader in decentralized AI, ‚Äúfocused on the enterprise side,‚Äù according to the analyst. NEAR, a top AI layer-one protocol, is selected for its potential to rebound during market dips and its foundational role in AI-driven applications, despite recent underperformance. Spectral (SPEC) is the ‚Äútop AI agent play in crypto‚Äù for Deutscher. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got big backers. There‚Äôs no [token] unlock for another six months. You can basically automate your trading on-chain via AI agents,‚Äù he added. In the infrastructure sector, Deutscher maintains an equal 25% allocation, focusing on foundational projects that underpin the crypto ecosystem. Solana (SOL) remains his primary choice, recognized for its role as the launchpad for new meme and AI trends, and projected to deliver consistent returns without the explosive growth potential of smaller altcoins. Related Reading: Crypto Craze: Investor Nets A 3,360% Gain, Turning $86,000 Into $3.75 Million Fantom (FTM) is favored by Deutscher for its strong narrative. ‚ÄúI just think it‚Äôs got a great narrative with Sonic [upgrade]. Andre [Cronje] is a big figure in the space. You‚Äôve had that cool down in terms of price and I think it‚Äôll be one of the prevalent and l1‚Äôs this cycle,‚Äù the analyst claims. Third, Deutscher picks Aptos (APT) over Sui (SUI) because of its higher potential: ‚ÄúI picked Aptos [‚Ä¶] because I just think in terms of a pair trade Aptos is probably the next to run after SUI already went on a massive run. That‚Äôs the only reason and the other thing is the price is looking good from a TA point of view. It‚Äôs still down significantly from all-time high so it has room from for for major upside.‚Äù Real-world assets (RWA) constitute 10% of Deutscher‚Äôs portfolio, a sector he believes is poised for significant adoption. His selections, CPOOL and CHEX, are chosen for their solid protocol development, strategic partnerships, and upcoming exchange listings, which are expected to enhance their market legitimacy and growth potential. Additionally, Pendle is mentioned as an honorable mention, recognized for its strong narrative, partnerships, and organic token distribution, making it a standout performer in the RWA space. The gaming sector, though traditionally undervalued, receives a 10% allocation in Deutscher‚Äôs portfolio. He highlighted Beam and Super as his top picks, with Beam serving as an infrastructure play backed by substantial treasury reserves and strategic partnerships, and Super functioning as a community-driven gaming meme coin with strong utility and a cult-like following. In the DeFi sector, Deutscher allocates 5% of his portfolio to two primary assets: AAVE and Rune. AAVE is identified as the strongest DeFi blue-chip, benefiting from robust revenue streams and increasing on-chain yields, making it a reliable cornerstone for the portfolio. Rune is viewed by Deutscher as a leveraged bet on the market‚Äôs bullish trajectory, expected to perform exceptionally well during market upswings due to its reflexive nature and the functionality of its Omnipool. At press time, WIF traded at $2.43.

42407340,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZGWpc,1730114335,"Crypto Policy Didn't Occupy the Spotlight in Elections in Austria, Georgia","Politicians in Austria and Georgia did not put a particular focus on crypto to sway voters in their elections, unlike the emphasis seen in Japan.  Georgia saw its ruling party the Georgian Dream Party get the most votes, and Austria's far right Freedom party won in that nation's parliamentary election.  In many other countries around the world, political parties chose to make their approach to crypto clear before elections commenced.  Political leaders in Austria, like other European Union nations, did not tap into the global crypto policy debate to sway voters during its recent election. In the run up to its election over the weekend Georgia, which has candidate status in the EU, was likewise quiet on the issue.  Nations such as the U.K. and others in Europe had already established how they wanted to regulate the sector before their elections, so little needed to be said about crypto before their polls opened. The U.S., where exchanges have been calling for bespoke rules, stands in stark contrast. Crypto has come up often prior to the Nov. 5 general election, and in Japan, politicians leaned on the need to reform crypto tax ahead of the general election which saw Japan‚Äôs ruling Liberal Democratic Party's coalition lose its majority.  ""Crypto and digital assets policy in the EU [European Union] isn't really a partisan issue,"" Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation said. This was evident in the EU Parliament election, where no single party focused more on crypto issues.  Austria's recent national election marked the far-right Freedom Party's win in the Austrian parliament. The party won 29.2% of the vote and beat the ruling center-right People‚Äôs Party that came in second place with 26.5% of the vote. The winning party's policies centered around immigration and the cost of living, but other Austrian parties have said they won't work with it, leading to the nation's President Alexander Van der Bellen asking the incumbent Chancellor Karl Nehammer to form a new government.  Politicians there did not lean into crypto discussions on the way to the Freedom Party's parliamentary win. Austria is part of the European Union, a block of 27 nations that are already on their way to enforcing the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation, tailored rules for the sector. MiCA passed into law last year and will fully come into force in December.  Georgia, which cooperates politically and economically as an EU candidate, implemented regulations that required crypto companies to get registration in 2023. In the election over the weekend, voters chose to side with the ruling Georgian Dream Party, which secured around 54% of the vote. The elections were portrayed by parties as a choice between aligning further with Europe or Russia so, choosing the Georgian Dream Party signified a move towards the latter. The pro-European opposition parties are disputing the results.  However, the United National Movement (UNM) ‚Äì a political opposition party in Georgia ‚Äì recently joined up with Rarilabs to release a new blockchain solution for public administration leading up to the election.

The company is uniquely positioned to capture the recent trend of surging demand from AI companies, the report said.  The company's mining operations are profitable and becoming more efficient, the report said.  Core Scientific (CORZ) is uniquely well positioned to capture surging artificial intelligence (AI) demand given the company's large available power supply and strong data center development team, Jefferies said in a Monday research report initiating coverage of the bitcoin miner.  The bank assumed coverage of the stock with a buy rating and a $19 price target. The shares were 1.7% higher at $13.60 in early trading.  ""We expect that many big tech companies will be closely watching the CoreWeave developments and successful execution will convince decision makers to sign future development leases with CORZ,"" analysts Jonathan Petersen and Jan Aygul wrote.  Core signed a 12-year AI contract with hyperscaler CoreWeave in June, in a landmark deal for the industry.  The bitcoin miner is expected to diversify its tenant base to other hyperscalers, Jefferies said, noting that management has said it expects to make further announcements by year-end.  While the economics of any future AI deals may not be as favorable as the CoreWeave lease, they are still expected to be very accretive, Jefferies said.  The company's bitcoin mining operations remain profitable and are getting more efficient, the note said.  A material expansion of Core's bitcoin mining business is not expected.

In just two weeks, GOAT skyrocketed from virtually zero to over $900 million in market capitalization, drawing comparisons with last year‚Äôs memecoin sensation, PEPE. This rapid ascent has captivated both analysts and investors, who are beginning to see GOAT as a potential contender for memecoin dominance in the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Positions Face Serious Risk Above $68,500 ‚Äì Details Much like PEPE‚Äôs explosive rise in 2023, GOAT has defied initial skepticism, proving that meme coins still hold significant sway among crypto enthusiasts and speculative traders. With its rapidly growing community and social media buzz, many are asking if GOAT has what it takes to become this cycle‚Äôs meme coin reference point. As the excitement builds, the market is closely watching to see if GOAT can maintain its momentum and establish itself as the next big name in the unpredictable world of meme coins. Can GOAT Lead Meme Coins This Cycle? Top crypto analyst and investor Daan recently shared an insightful comparison on X between the rising meme coin Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) and 2023‚Äôs sensation, PEPE. In his analysis, Daan noted that while GOAT has surged remarkably since its recent launch, the initial trajectory of PEPE was even faster. PEPE reached a market cap of approximately $1.4 billion within 22 days of launching, whereas by day 17, it held around $600 million‚Äîclose to GOAT‚Äôs current standing. Daan emphasized that PEPE‚Äôs local peak occurred when Binance listed it for spot and perpetual contracts, sparking a ‚Äúblow-off top.‚Äù This listing and the subsequent price spike marked a turning point, as PEPE didn‚Äôt return to those price levels for another 10 months. Daan also highlighted other quick-surge tokens, such as SLERF and BOME, which ran higher earlier this year during a local market peak. However, he believes GOAT and PEPE stand apart as probable long-term players in the meme coin space, given their roles as sector leaders. By positioning GOAT alongside PEPE, Daan underscored the potential for GOAT to mirror PEPE‚Äôs lasting appeal among investors. Related Reading: Solana Bullish Pattern Holds ‚Äì Crypto Analyst Sets $202 Target As GOAT continues to gain traction, the market remains speculative, and comparisons like Daan‚Äôs shed light on how meme coins like GOAT could evolve‚Äîeither stabilizing as a major player or facing a similar volatility cycle post-peak. With GOAT‚Äôs market cap climbing and interest growing, time will tell whether it can follow a similar trajectory to PEPE or carve out a unique legacy within the meme coin sector. Price Action: Technical View GOAT is currently trading at $0.637 after a retrace from its all-time high of $0.915. While data on GOAT‚Äôs price movements remain limited due to its recent launch, the 4-hour chart reveals essential levels that could define near-term demand and supply zones. The key demand level to watch is around $0.56‚Äîpreviously a significant resistance since GOAT‚Äôs debut, now flipped to act as strong support. If GOAT can hold above this $0.56 mark, it could signal sustained interest from buyers, positioning the token for another upward move. On the supply side, $0.72 is the next critical zone to test. A push through this level would likely bring new bullish momentum as traders look for higher levels and potential gains above recent highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Activity Spikes To 6-Week High ‚Äì Smart Money Accumulation? The $0.72 area will act as short-term resistance, and should GOAT manage to break through it, the price could move toward a fresh all-time high.

42373497,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmhc7,1730108312,MicroStrategy‚Äôs Current Premium Relative to Its Bitcoin Stack Is Unlikely to Last: Steno Research,"MicroStrategy's almost 300% premium to its bitcoin holdings is unsustainable, the report said.  The positive effects of the company's recent stock split are wearing off and the launch of options on spot bitcoin ETFs will also lessen demand, Steno said.  The report noted that during the 2021 crypto bull market MicroStrategy's premium hovered below 200%.  MicroStrategy's (MSTR) current premium relative to its bitcoin {{BTC}} stack is unlikely to last, Steno Research said in a report Friday.  ""This conviction is reinforced by the diminishing effects of MicroStrategy's recent stock split,"" analyst Mads Eberhardt wrote, adding that the launch of options on spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S will also lessen the motivation for investors to hold the stock over these ETFs.  The software company founded by Michael Saylor carried out a 10-for-1 stock split in August, a move that according to Steno has contributed to the recent rally.  Steno noted that the company's premium relative to its bitcoin horde has recently surged to almost 300%.  This suggests that the firm's valuation is ""diverging significantly from a straightforward calculation of its asset and and business fundamentals,"" the report said.  As regulators become more favorable to bitcoin and crypto in general, investors may choose to hold bitcoin directly instead of MicroStrategy stock, Steno said. If Donald Trump is re-elected this regulatory trend is expected to continue.  Bitcoin is expected to perform strongly this quarter and into 2025, which means that an ""even higher buying demand would be required to sustain MicroStrategy's current premium,"" the note said.  MicroStrategy's existing premium is unsustainable, especially given the fact that during the 2021 crypto bull market it was below 200% for most of the time, the report added.  The stock recently hit a new all-time high, having surged over 240% year-to-date.

The fund will rotate that money into crypto after the election results are clear and the losing side accepts the defeat, Hayes added.  It doesn't matter who wins beyond the short-term, Hayes quipped.  With the U.S. election just a week away, markets are waiting with bated breath for the political event that has created ""high uncertainty.""  Arthur Hayes, chief investment officer at digital asset investment fund Maelstrom and co-founder of BitMEX, is hedging the election risk with Ethena Lab's USDe stablecoin while maintaining large bullish bets in bitcoin {{BTC}}, ether {{ETH}} and other cryptocurrencies.  ""Given the uncertainty, Maelstrom has 5% of the fund in staked USDe (Ethena USD), earning roughly 13%. We maintain our large long positions in Bitcoin, Ether, and other tokens,"" Hayes told CoinDesk in an email.  Ethena's USDe is a synthetic dollar, which uses collateralized stablecoin and a hedged cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy to retail the $1 price peg. The funding fee collected from shorting perpetual futures tied to BTC and ETH as a part of the carry trade represents the yield. Staking USDe and acquiring staked USDe, or sUSDe, a reward-bearing token, automatically grants the user access to protocol rewards.  The fund's allocation in the delta-neutral product will guard against potential market price swings in the lead-up to the election on Nov. 5 and results, due three days later on Nov. 8.  Maelstrom is an investment fund focused on digital assets and managed by the family office of Arthur Hayes (co-founder, BitMEX). The fund‚Äôs mandate is to build a portfolio of infrastructure companies that will serve as the foundation of the next wave of trustless decentralization. In addition to managing the fund, Hayes writes the industry-leading monthly newsletter Crypto Trader Digest.  Watch out for a sore loser  Hayes expects risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, to see increased price turbulence for a while if the losing side takes to the street, causing social unrest.  According to traditional media, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris are locked in a dead heat. Meanwhile, betting on decentralized prediction platforms has the supposedly pro-crypto Trump leading his rival Harris by a significant margin.  ""If the election comes and goes with no social unrest, the markets will rip and roar. Post the election, once we know who wins, and the other side accepts the results, then we will deploy all sUSDe into crypto,"" Hayes said.  As of Friday, bitcoin options listed on Deribit signaled volatility of nearly 3.8% for Nov. 8. BTC has historically seen more giant swings on random non-event days.  It doesn't matter who wins  The outcome of the U.S. election is unlikely to significantly alter Bitcoin's broader bullish prospects, as budget deficits are likely to continue rising irrespective of who takes the presidency. Bitcoin and gold are perceived as safe haven assets, offering a hedge against budget deficits, which tend to be inflationary.  ""Both Trump and Harris will print money in the trillions of dollars. In the medium term, it doesn't matter who wins. Crypto will do well. In the short term, the market understands the ways in which Trump will stimulate the economy because that is the traditional way it has been done in the past. Tax cuts combined with business-friendly deregulation but with no cuts in benefits is what he will do,"" Hayes explained.  Legendary trader Paul Tudor Jones voiced a similar opinion last week, saying inflation will continue to rise regardless of whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris wins the presidency. Several crypto traders are betting on a bitcoin rally to $80,000 and higher after the election.  Potential war is a short-term risk  Looking past the election, a potential escalation of war in the Middle East or Ukraine could lead to short-term pain for risk asset holders.  ""The biggest macro risk is if friends and foes of the U.S. engage in aggressive military action while there is confusion as to who is in charge after the election. War is un-investable in the short-term and this would lead to a global risk off,"" Hayes quipped, saying that the war's inflationary impact would eventually bode well for crypto.  ""The way to play this risk is to size positions accordingly and use little to no leverage,"" Hayes said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/28/arthur-hayes-maelstrom-hedges-us-election-uncertainty-with-staked-usde-holds-large-btc-eth-bullish-bets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1e19fea6516e0d2982a4f8b19325d1f78411ff1-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35238730,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650211,1730106026,"Bitcoin Stock To Flow Model Shows Price Is Ready For Next Phase Transition Above $100,000","Bitcoin is on its way to retesting the $69,000 price level again in the early hours of Monday, October 28, as the bulls look to start the week on a positive note. A notable break above $69,000 would set the stage for a sustained rally in the coming months. Speaking of sustained rally, the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model is pointing to an interesting trend in the long-term outlook for Bitcoin. Particularly, crypto analyst Plan B made reference to the Stock-to-Flow model to suggest that BTC is ready for the next phase transition. BTC Is Ready For Next Phase Transition The Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model is drawing attention as it signals that Bitcoin may be gearing up for a new phase transition that would solidify its price above $100,000. The S2F model, originally developed for commodities like gold and silver, measures an asset‚Äôs existing supply against the rate of new units entering the market. In the case of BTC, the S2F model calculates scarcity by taking its fixed supply of 21 million BTC into account, along with the block reward halvings that reduce new supply every four years. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Flashes Bullish Pennant On Daily Heikin Ashi Chart, What This Means Each halving event decreases the issuance rate, creating an increasing scarcity that the model correlates with price growth. According to the S2F chart shared by Plan B, these halvings have led to price increases in the months after, with the S2F model accurately forecasting Bitcoin‚Äôs transitions into new price levels. Bitcoin last halved in April 2024, resulting in the block reward slashing from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. According to the S2F chart, past Bitcoin halvings have always started the price transition into a new phase. The 2020 halving, for example, kickstarted the transition into a new phase above $10,000 that culminated in BTC reaching the previous all-time high of around $66,000. Now that the April 2024 halving is six months behind us, the effects of the halving are starting to be factored into the supply and demand of Bitcoin. As such, Bitcoin is looking prime for a phase transition above $100,000. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? As past phase transitions have played out, a phase transition above $100,000 would solidify the Bitcoin price above this level. With the $100,000 price level now serving as a price floor, this would give the Bitcoin price the support to keep increasing in the months after. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $24? Analyst Says No One Will Believe It Until It Happens Previous phase transitions have always led to a new peak before another halving. The anticipated peak for this phase is just below $1,000,000. If past trends hold true, the Bitcoin price could reach this impressive milestone ahead of the next halving, which is expected to take place in 2028. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $68,340.

42373502,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmhx9,1730099230,"Bitcoin Has a Lot Going for It, Except the Persistent Slide in Copper-Gold Ratio","The widely-tracked copper-to-gold ratio continues to slide in the wake of China's stimulus announcements, offering negative cues to risk assets.  BTC's best years have been characterized by copper's outperformance relative to gold.  From the increasing probability of pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump winning the upcoming U.S. presidential election to expectations for Fed rate cuts, bitcoin {{BTC}} bulls have several things to cheer about. However, the widely-tracked copper-to-gold ratio, continues to slide, flashing a red signal for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The ratio, which represents the division of price per pound of copper by per ounce price of gold, has hit a fresh year-to-date low, reaching the levels seen in late 2020, according to data source TradingView.  The metric, considered a proxy for the global economic health and investor risk appetite, has dropped over 15% this year, the biggest loss since 2018.  Telltale sign of economic malaise?  What's probably more concerning is that the ratio has declined by 10% since China, the world's factory and largest importer of commodities, unveiled a string of stimulus measures in late September to support its ailing economy.  The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered an outsized 50 basis points interest rate cut in September, supposedly kicking off the so-called liquidity easing. However, that too failed to put a floor under the ratio.  The persistent slide could be a telltale sign of a grittier economic picture that risk assets are probably overlooking. Copper, being an industrial metal, tends to do well when the global economy is expanding, and has historically reacted positively to China's stimulus announcements. Gold, meanwhile, is considered a safe haven. Hence, a falling copper-to-gold ratio is widely seen as a risk-off signal.  BTC vs copper-to-gold ratio  As of writing, BTC was up 60% for the year, trading near $67,800, according to CoinDesk data.  However, most gains occurred in the first quarter and since then, the bulls have consistently failed to secure a new base above the $70,000 mark. The bull failure has been attributed to several factors, including supply overhang fears stemming from defunct exchange Mt. Gox's credit reimbursements.  Coincidentally, the slide in the copper-to-gold ratio began in May, offering risk-off cues. The downtrend gathered steam in July, presaging the brief early August risk aversion in financial markets that saw BTC slide from $65,000 to $50,000.  Besides, data from TradingView show that BTC's best years ‚Äì 2013, 2016-17, and 2020-21 ‚Äì have been characterized by an uptrend in the copper-to-gold ratio.  If the past is a guide, the plummeting copper-to-gold ratio casts doubt on bullish BTC expectations, calling for a rally to $100,000 by the year's end.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/28/bitcoin-has-a-lot-going-for-it-except-the-persistent-slide-in-copper-gold-ratio,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7ecc9b1c3dbe306ed510a4dfecc0218e9d5fdcb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some predictions say the price could go up by 220%, hitting $0.00044 by November 26, 2024. However, new research shows that the short-term technical signs point in a different direction. Related Reading: MicroStrategy Stock Hits All-Time High As Bitcoin Blazes Past $67,000 Crypto analyst Alan Santana has pointed out that the token‚Äôs current sideways movement may signal further declines. Since reaching a high in March 2024, FLOKI has been trapped in a bearish trend, unable to regain its previous momentum. After a brief rally in June, the price has stagnated, reflecting a shift in market sentiment. According to Santana, traders should ‚Äúprepare for the crash‚Äù, given the current negative market dynamics in play, based on his examination of the memecoin‚Äôs price movement. #Altcoins | #FLOKI ‚ú¥Ô∏è Floki Inu Major Drop Now Imminent: Prepare For The Crash!

Notice the huge green candles in February 2024, these are about‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/5OrScWHNeb ‚Äî Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) October 27, 2024 Analyzing The Current Dynamics The current technical indicators show a disturbing trend for Floki Inu. It seems the token is experiencing a long consolidation phase, which can be termed as a ‚Äúdistribution phase,‚Äù and the sellers are in charge. The heavy trading volumes during its earlier bullish moves, particularly in February and March, have shifted to heavy selling in recent weeks. As of now, FLOKI trades at $0.0001315, down 1.20% over the past day, and many are watching key support levels closely. Two really important support zones have developed. Should the bearish trend persist, analysts estimate FLOKI would retest the initial support level at $0.00009557. Should that break, the token may drop to a possible lowest value of $0.00004200. For those clinging to their tokens, this situation begs questions about whether it is time to change their stance. Fibonacci Levels Suggest Weakness Another technical indicator that is negative in its sentiment is the Fibonacci retracing levels. Most importantly, for FLOKI to dominate the market, it has been consistently rejected at the 0.618 and 0.786 levels. The persistent rejection of the price here indicates that the positive feeling is being crushed. Price action shows that FLOKI will go below its current trading range, which piles on more pressure on the holders as well. Caution For Investors In view of these contradictory messages, investors should still be extremely cautious. Since the immediate future seems hard, many predictions indicate there‚Äôs going to be an uptrend, and investors can hit a price that might reach $0.00044 at the end of November. However, many traders remain skeptical given the current sentiment. Related Reading: Whales Hit All-Time High Bitcoin Holdings At 670,000 ‚Äì What Does This Mean For BTC?
