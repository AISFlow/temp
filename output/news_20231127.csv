20784691,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562588,1701126018,"Ethereum Return To $4,800: Analyst Identifies Pattern To Trigger Rally To ATH","The Ethereum price has been trading more than 50% below its all-time high of $4,800 for the better part of a year now with no sign of returning to its previous all-time high. However, this slow trend may not continue for much longer as a crypto analyst has identified a pattern that could trigger a rally to its previous highs. Ethereum Stuck Inside A Bullish Triangle In an analysis that was posted on TradingView, crypto analyst FieryTrading identified a unique pattern that the Ethereum price has been trading in for almost two years. This pattern is a bullish triangle pattern and it has persisted for more than one and a half years. Related Reading: Shibarium Transactions Spike 288%, But Why Is Shiba Inu Price Down Today? Looking at the chart, the Ethereum price has not deviated from this bullish triangle and has not had any success breaking out of it. The triangle began toward mid-2022 when the Terra Network collapse triggered a crypto market-wide crash. Then even with multiple major recoveries since then, the altcoin’s price remains inside this triangle. Source: Tradingview.com The lower end of this bullish triangle is at $887 which is the cycle low, and the upper end has been tracked at just above $2,100. Given this range, it suggests that for Ethereum to break out of this bullish triangle, it would have to clear the $2,200 resistance. What Happens If ETH Breaks Out Of This Pattern? As the crypto analyst highlights, a breakout of this pattern would lead to a massive rally. The top of this breakout rally could eventually see the Ethereum price return to its 2021 all-time high levels, reaching above $4,800. ETH price at $2,047 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com “In my eyes, a break out from this pattern might result in big gains for ETH, since it will burst through an area full of short-trade stop-losses which will be forced to buy back their positions,” FieryTrading said. A move to $4,800 would translate to a 130% increase from its current price levels. Related Reading: Did JPMorgan Secretly Buy 7.5 Million XRP? Here’s What We Know However, the crypto analyst explains that this could be more of a long-term performance, so it is possible that the cryptocurrency will not complete this move until at least the year 2024. But it paints a good, bullish picture for the altcoin going forward. On its own this year, the Ethereum price has performed quite well, especially over the last 30 days. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that ETH’s price has risen 16.53% in one month to break above the $2,000 resistance which has now turned into support. Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of approximately $250 billion.

Unlocks increase a digital asset's supply and allow early investors to sell tokens.  Several major alternative cryptocurrencies including native tokens of dYdX [DYDX], Optimism [OP] and Sui [SUI] dropped Monday as massive token unlocks weighed on prices amid a generally negative day on the broader crypto market.  Altcoins face almost $650 million worth of increase in their supply through this week, according to data from Token.Unlocks and CryptoRank.  DYDX will see roughly $480 million worth of tokens added to its circulating supply, almost doubling the current amount of tokens on the market. OP, SUI, Axelar [AXL], Immutable X [IMX] and 1inch [1INCH] and Hedera [HBAR] also have large unlocks scheduled in coming days.  Token unlockings translate to an increase in the asset's supply, releasing coins from a vesting period including to early investors. Large unlocking events usually lead to price declines due to the supply increase outpacing investor demand for the asset, a study by crypto analytics firm The Tie found earlier this year.  Axelar [AXL] dropped 10% in the past 24 hours as about $18 million worth of tokens – some 5% of its market capitalization – were added to its supply Monday during its scheduled monthly token unlock, including to early investors, according to CryptoRank data.  DYDX was down 7% during the same period ahead of the release of $480 million worth of tokens on Dec. 1.  OP declined nearly 6%, with an unlock of $40 million in tokens looming on Nov. 30.  SUI plunged 8.8% during the day as its supply will increase by $48 million over the course of the week.  1INCH fell over 4% with its supply set to increase by almost 10%, or $33 million, on Dec. 1. HBAR and IMX endured 2%-3% declines with each facing $11 million tokens being unlocked this week.

20782981,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562692,1701122452,Crypto Scam Alert: Fraudsters Impersonate Forbes Journalists In Plot To Rob BAYC Holders,"In the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) sector, scammers are constantly devising new methods to exploit unsuspecting collectors. The latest incident involves fraudsters posing as journalists from Forbes magazine, specifically targeting Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT holders. One BAYC owner, “Crumz,” recently shared his encounter with these scammers, detailing the elaborate scheme designed to steal his digital assets. BAYC Collector’s Close Encounter With Scammers According to Crumz, the scam began when he received a direct message on X (formerly Twitter) from someone claiming to be a Forbes editor named Robert Lafranco. Intrigued by the prospect of being featured in an article about BAYC, Crumz proceeded cautiously, conducting a cursory online search that seemingly confirmed the person’s identity. Unbeknownst to him, the scammers had meticulously crafted a “facade of credibility.” The supposed Forbes journalist informed Crumz of their interest in gathering firsthand accounts from BAYC owners regarding their experiences within the club. Despite initial surprise at being approached, Crumz agreed to participate in a scheduled Zoom call. Related Reading: Cosmos Co-Founder’s Controversial Proposal Triggers 11% Plunge In ATOM Crumz further stated that the scammers failed to show up for the initial call, citing a fabricated family emergency as the reason for their absence. They rescheduled the meeting for a later date. When the rescheduled call finally took place, Crumz noticed several red flags. The individuals on the call refused to activate their cameras, claiming technical difficulties. Another person claiming to be Steven Ehrlich, Forbes’ research director, joined the conversation. Crumz shared his BAYC journey, recounting the early days and highlighting the club’s unique features. During the call, Crumz alleges that the scammers exhibited further suspicious behavior. They lacked a premium Zoom account and insisted on using multiple call links. Additionally, they requested permission to record the screen using a separate recording bot. Although Crumz initially thought nothing of it, alarm bells rang when they asked him to find a banana and say something that resembled his Bored Ape character. Unable to produce a banana on the spot, Crumz excused himself momentarily, muting his screen. During this momentary lapse, the scammers attempted to take control of his computer, prompting him to intervene when they navigated to the website delegate.cash. Ultimately, all of Crumz’s valuable NFTs were securely stored in cold storage, safeguarding them from potential theft. He promptly shut down his computer to ensure his safety, hoping to sever any remote access the scammers may have gained. Crumz concluded: Hopefully I’m safe now. Don’t think they can still control my computer when I turn it back on. Please be safe out there, it could’ve been a dreadful day today Decline In Sales And Market Engagement BAYC has recently witnessed a notable decline in various key metrics. The latest NFT data reveals a decrease in the number of sales, sales volume, and primary sales. According to the latest figures, the number of sales has seen a significant drop of 33.59%, with 87 sales reported at present compared to 131 sales recorded the previous day. This decrease in sales has also resulted in a decline in sales in USD, with a decrease of 38.02%. The current sales volume is $2 million, compared to $3 million on Sunday.

20781370,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562678,1701118816,"Hamas And Hezbollah Pick Tron Instead Of Bitcoin In Crypto Shift, Report","TRON (TRX), a blockchain-based digital platform, has surpassed Bitcoin (BTC) as the platform of choice for financial transfers by groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, which are designated terrorist organizations by the US, UK, and other countries. According to a Reuters report, this development has opened a new front in Israel’s battle against the funding of alleged Iranian-backed militant groups. Tron Wallets Targeted In Israeli Seizures According to the report, a comprehensive analysis of crypto seizures announced by Israeli security services since 2021 highlights a significant increase in targeting TRON wallets and a decrease in seizures related to Bitcoin wallets. The National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) of Israel, responsible for seizure operations, froze a total of 143 TRON wallets between July 2021 and October 2023, believing them to be associated with “designated terrorist organizations” or involved in “severe terror crimes.” Notably, 87 of these seizures occurred this year, including 39 wallets linked to Lebanon’s Hezbollah and 26 wallets associated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a Hamas ally. Related Reading: Blast Surpasses Cardano And Base – Here’s How Much DeFi Investors Have Locked In response to heightened scrutiny of Hamas’ financing, Israel intensified its investigation efforts. It discovered that 56 TRON wallets were connected to Hamas, with 46 traced back to a Gaza-based money exchange company called Dubai Co. For Exchange. Following the recent Hamas attacks on Israel, the largest crypto account seizure to date was announced, freezing approximately 600 accounts associated with Dubai Co. Per the report, several individuals whose funds were frozen in this seizure claimed to have been using TRON for legitimate business or personal financial purposes and denied any affiliation with Hamas or Islamic Jihad. However, Israel designates Dubai Co. as a terrorist group due to its alleged aid to Hamas, particularly in transferring substantial funds on an annual basis. Key Blockchain For Tether Transactions When contacted by Reuters, a spokesperson for TRON, Hayward Wong, emphasized that all technologies have the potential for misuse, citing the example of US dollars being employed for money laundering. Wong further stated that TRON lacks control over how its technology is utilized and asserted that it is not linked to the groups identified by Israel. The report also sheds light on the dominance of the cryptocurrency Tether (USDT) within the TRON network. Tether stated that it routinely traces and freezes tokens used for illicit purposes, working in collaboration with law enforcement agencies. According to Reuters, TRON has become the primary blockchain for Tether transactions, hosting a remarkable $48 billion worth of the tokens. Average daily transactions on Tron jumped to 9.1 million from April to June, a remarkable increase of over 70% compared to last year. However, as reported by our sister website Bitcoinist, Tron has faced its share of controversies. The founder of Tron, Justin Sun, sued the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March on allegations of artificially inflating trading volumes and selling unregistered Tron tokens. Related Reading: XRP Price Manipulated? Crypto Pundits Alarmed By Market Patterns It is important to note that crypto transactions related to terrorist groups have been decreasing since 2021 as seen in the chart below. Unlike traditional payment methods, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies provide authorities with a backdoor, a transparent path that has allowed them to put a halt to illegal money flows. The unfolding developments in this matter are yet to be fully determined, and it remains uncertain whether there will be additional lawsuits and enforcement actions against crypto companies and exchanges implicated in these allegations.

42391971,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfyBOp,1701115551,Breaking Down the Bankless Backlash,"Here’s a crypto story full of sound and fury that may actually have a happy ending: Bankless HQ, a media brand, and BanklessDAO, a semi-related entity, are discussing divorce. And it’s the kids’ fault.  It’s unlikely the split will be acrimonious; David Hoffman and Ryan Sean Adams, the co-creators of the influential Bankless brand, submitted a proposal to the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that shares a name. Right now they just want to talk.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “We're in the parameterizing phase right now,” Hoffman said in a video call. The professional podcaster’s livestream quality was crystal clear, the bitrate of someone who puts time, attention and capital into the two-to-four news roundups and interviews uploaded each week.  The topic and terms being “defined?” Whether BanklessDAO will be able to call itself that going forward, after a proposed fundraising and education initiative, put forward by the DAO, apparently without Hoffman and Adams’ knowledge, blew up the entire brand this holiday weekend.  Specifically, a large section of “Crypto Twitter” (and some segments of “Bitcoin Twitter”) took serious offense that BanklessDAO requested 1,818,630 ARB (ARB trades around dollar parity, so ~$1.8 million) to fund a year-long education initiative intending to onboard people to the Arbitrum network.  “This triggered the reflex of crypto Twitter … people thought it was a DAO treasury raid,” Hoffman said. It’s happened before: five times in the past two years, according to Hoffman. “It seems like there’s these pile-on events where somebody's mad about us for something and … it's, like, ‘time to air our grievances about Bankless.’”  The proposal, if passed by Arbitrum’s affiliated DAO, would fund a “multilingual marketing campaign,” content writing, 22 podcasts, 50 events and 85 “how to” training sessions, all meant to introduce the core Arbitrum tech and tools/protocols built on top of the Ethereum scaling layer to a new audience.  See also: DAOs Don't Have to Be Completely Decentralized | Opinion  Whether that is a “treasury raid” is a matter where reasonable minds can disagree, and something the Arbitrum DAO will vote on. BanklessDAO has done similar initiatives in the past, the most relevant being for rival Ethereum L2 Optimism – most of which Hoffman claimed total ignorance of (“I've been asking for that information and I haven't really gotten any,” he said).  To Hoffman, the most recent backlash is the result of a few moving parts. First is that X (née Twitter) is a “funhouse mirror” and “bad content platform for conversation.” Second, Arbitrum paid about half a million dollars to advertise on Bankless’ media products, which makes the DAO’s separate funding request optically a cash grab.  Most important is an issue that should be intensely familiar to anyone who has spent any amount of time in or observing DAOs: the “failure to delineate” between distinct organizations that often share a name and founders, but exist for different ends.  See also: DAOs May Be the Future of Work, but Don't Bet on Them Being the Next Big Asset Class  Bankless, for instance, is the established media brand that covers the niche DeFi sector. It employs about 20 people, if you include its full-time contractors, and is the brainchild of Hoffman and Adams. There is a media team that produces podcasts and newsletters, a business side that manages relationships including with advertisers and a “software arm” that is finding its footing.  Hoffman and Adams also manage a separate VC entity that raised $35 million, though the Bankless LLC has never taken outside funding since incorporating in 2020 (when the duo went full time with it).  BanklessDAO, meanwhile, legally speaking, is an organization that does not even exist. The DAO was founded in 2021, amid a bull run that saw bitcoin rocket $69,000, and so while it counts just under 30,000 members on Discord, it’s hard to judge how many joined and left. Hoffman described the DAO as a “very flat” entity composed of “sub DAOs,” including units focused on consulting and publishing, an audio and video guild and something called “Fight Club.”  “They all come together and, like, amalgamate into the DAO,” he said. Hoffman and Adams at one point paid two Bankless staffers for an additional role of “DAO coordination,” who could have had the CEO title, if that term made sense in the world of DAOs.  DAOs are something of a crypto-specific idea, once described by the New York Times as a “group chat with a bank account.” Some DAOs oversee major financial operations, like MakerDAO and Maker, but they’re usually just a social group with a Discord channel and a token that gates club access and serves as seed funding. And like most crypto-specific ideas: they have issues.  The Bankless founders, after initially getting defensive and deflecting responsibility for the DAO’s actions, are now on Twitter and the Bankless Discord, making attempts at damage control. There’s “an actual meeting later this week to just to see each other face-to-face,” Hoffman said.  One of BanklessDAO’s primary complaints is that Hoffman and Adams have been “hands off.” This is a legitimate point of contention; the Bankless co-founders started the DAO, promoted it over their many distribution channels and at one point held as much as 25% of the BANK tokens used to vote on governance decisions. (They haven’t sold tokens, they both said, but now collectively own less than 15% after distributing some to “the [ DAO ] genesis team.”)  Bankless also handed off its work on a profitable, branded on-chain investing protocol with Index Coop to BanklessDAO when it launched in 2021 as well as a blockchain-related apparel project with MetaFactory. While membership from the company to the DAO has been fluid in the past, DAO members do not get voting rights over all of Bankless and “no current HQ employee has also been a DAO person,” Hoffman said.  “It is a headless brand,” as Hoffman said, who may not even have a right to say such a thing  There’s a reasonable argument to make that someone — perhaps, say, the Bankless founders — should have been more involved in the DAO’s operations. If only because an amorphous social club was licensing their valuable trademarks free-of-charge, and making decisions that could materially affect the actual business’ interests.  Hoffman recognizes that was a mistake, and seems convinced the solution is to cleave the organizations. Adams tweeted Sunday there’s a plan to “submit a governance proposal to @BanklessDAO early next week to clarify branding separation between the entities” and burn their bank of BANK tokens. No formal proposal has been made, and there are many different possible outcomes.  To some extent, there is a lesson here for crypto startup founders about the dangers of ceding partial control of your business or reputation to an outside organization. There are lessons, too, for DAOs and the importance of leadership. And while I personally think BanklessDAO’s Arbitrum education proposal is reasonable — the budget asked for is in line both with DAO compensation and marketing initiatives — there’s probably a bigger message to be made about messaging.  See also: Bankless Crypto Channel Banned From YouTube  But for Hoffman, Bankless is also “an idea.” While from the jump the co-founders knew they wanted to keep Bankless HQ a “lean” company with a well-defined audience, Hoffman and Adams are also the truest of true believers in crypto and were taken by the idea of “decentralizing” their media operation.  “So many people would DM us and offer their services and backgrounds in some adjacent field … wanting to help Bankless,” Hoffman said. “We just didn't have a spot for them inside of the centralized company.”  Around the time their podcasts began to take off, DAOs were a topic of polite conversation — that same year a NYT reporter participated in a failed initiative to purchase an original manuscript of the U.S. Constitution, for instance — and the whole thing began to seem like a way Bankless could grow without really growing.  And to a large extent, that is true. Bankless, the media company, run by two founders without any prior journalistic experience, is one the most successful organizations in the game. At a time when crypto trade publications are slashing budgets and employees, Bankless is biding its time even as its audience has shrunk significantly.  There are legitimate complaints about potential conflicts of interests, an overly positive bias and a reliance on Web2 funding models like advertising at Bankless. It is also undoubtedly an enviable operation.  Hoffman and Adams spend their time reading and writing about and communicating what they love, and are profitable for it. Bankless is frequently where I go when I want to understand the complexities of crypto, and is often what I recommend to people looking to dip their toes into something new on Ethereum.  Likewise, BanklessDAO got big by leveraging the Bankless brand, and is now such a force it has to be reckoned with by its makers. It seems like one of the few DAOs worth joining, and before this weekend’s backlash seemed relatively drama free. “It is a headless brand,” as Hoffman said, who may not even have a right to say such a thing.  To the extent that Bankless are bad actors or “bad for Ethereum,” as some malcontents have alleged, it’s only insofar as crypto today itself is laden with problems. The “movement” and “mission” both the company and DAO are “driving towards,” the idea of being “bankless,” would be terrible at least using the available alternatives. But give credit where it’s due, it’s still terrific branding.  But putting aside the issues that the Bankless brand embodies about Web3, this whole mess is also an issue of the internet crypto wants to replace. On social media, everyone thinks they can write — and so everyone thinks what Hoffman and Adams built is repeatable. It’s not, it takes work and dedication and some luck.  And while dogfights may be exasperated by Twitter’s algorithm, the way you communicate is still your choice.  CORRECTION (NOV. 27, 2023): It's Ryan Sean Adams, not Adam Sean Adams.

FinTech Challenges May Push Back Ripple IPO Timeline An XRP community member, Crypto Eri has shared details about Ripple IPO’s timeline in a post on X (formerly Twitter). The X post briefly shed light on a recent interview on NASDAQ Trade Talks, between global markets Reporter, Jill Malandrino and investment banker at Rosenblatt Securities, Dushyant Shahrawat. Related Reading: Road To $1: Why Did Terra Classic (USTC) Rise 300% In One Day? When asked about his views on the current state of the financial technology industry, Shahrawat emphasized the declining performance of some major fintech companies. He mentioned companies like Block which had experienced major declines this year and saw its shares dropping more than 80% from its all-time high. Shahrawat has stated that the underperformance of these fintech companies could result in a delay for cryptocurrencies scheduled to go public. He mentioned prominent names like Circle and Ripple, which had declared its intentions to initiate an IPO by 2024. “You can walk the hallways here, you’ve got Circle, Ripple, all the private fintech companies, unicorns, that were waiting in the wings to go public. That time frame (to IPO) got pushed back a little bit, quite a bit,” Shahrawat stated in the interview. Despite financial specialists predicting an early 2024 launch for the Ripple IPO, Shahrawat has hinted that a minor delay might be in store, at least until the bearish trend in the fintech sector shows signs of recovery. IPO Delay Amidst Regulatory Actions A blockchain researcher and XRP community member, Collin Brown has also highlighted reasons contributing to Ripple’s IPO delay. Brown has disclosed that the present market conditions and the intensified regulatory scrutiny on Binance are the driving forces behind the postponement of Ripple’s IPO. “The Ripple IPO is being delayed due to market circumstances, as well as the need for the SEC and BlackRock to crack down on Binance. Now that the path is clear, they will likely prepare for another correction. This will allow Wall Street giants to buy Bitcoin and XRP at lower prices,” Brown said. Related Reading: Whales Move $30 Million Worth Of XRP To Exchanges – Time To Sell? The researcher has also stated that the price of XRP could be pushed toward $50 soon. This prediction is based on the potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “Former NYSE President believes a Bitcoin ETF will attract a flood of money into the industry. Easier access to BTC will likely drive adoption and investment. Once the bitcoin ETF is approved, the XRP ETF will follow suit, pushing the price to $50 per XRP,” Brown said.

42391991,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfyC8z,1701114328,Coinbase Is Dominating a Key Bitcoin ETF Service,"Custody services are a vital part of bitcoin ETF applications, and Coinbase has been picked by nine out of the 12 prospective issuers.  BitGo, a large crypto custodian, has been left out. But BitGo CEO Mike Belshe says he's been in talks with ETF issuers.  The race to provide a key bit of infrastructure for bitcoin [BTC] ETFs – custody services – hasn't actually been much of a race so far. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) has dominated so far, winning the job from nearly every firm that wants to list an ETF, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree.  That's left a giant player in the space, BitGo, on the sidelines – an eye-catching omission.  Only one company that wants to create a bitoin ETF in the U.S., Hashdex, has yet to pick a custody partner. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe confirmed in an interview with CoinDesk that his company is working with ""many"" of the applicants, opening the possibility – albeit a slim one now – BitGo might show up yet.  ""I think Coinbase is the obvious solution on the custodian side and it makes sense that they're the most common,"" Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said. ""But there are some others,"" he added.  Seyffart said he wouldn't be surprised to see BitGo appear on someone's bitcoin ETF application eventually. Crypto exchange Gemini recently became the first third-party custody partner on an application, appearing in VanEck's.  Custody is an important part of the effort to bring a spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S. market. Custodians hold onto assets on behalf of someone else. In this case, that means safekeeping the (presumably billions of dollars worth of) bitcoin that ETFs will own, keeping hackers and any other bad actors at bay.  Coinbase, run by CEO Brian Armstrong, currently is the custodian for nine of the 12 proposed bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., a level of concentration that makes some uneasy. With Fidelity deciding to custody their own assets and VanEck picking Gemini, that leaves only one application that lists no custodian.  ""Having so much bitcoin concentrated in one custodian is not exactly ideal, and I think it would be beneficial for other quality exchanges to participate as custodians for ETFs,"" said Brian D. Evans, founder and CEO of BDE Ventures.  But it's tough to find other contenders, given the lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S., so the list of suitable companies is short, he said.

42391979,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfyBZ5,1701111926,Binance Founder CZ Stuck in U.S. for the Moment,"Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao must remain in the U.S., at least for the moment, as a federal judge considers a U.S. Department of Justice motion that would require him to remain in the country until he is sentenced early next year.  Zhao pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act last week and resigned as CEO of Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume. The exchange itself pleaded guilty to charges of violating sanctions and money transmission laws, agreeing to pay a $4.3 billion fine and embed compliance monitors who can report back to the U.S. government.  After Zhao pleaded guilty, a magistrate judge granted his release on a $175 million personal recognizance bond. Zhao put $15 million in a trust account and had three guarantors put up over $5 million in collateral to secure the bond. Under the terms of the bond release, he was free to return to the UAE, where his wife and children also reside. District Judge Richard Jones stayed this part of the ruling on Monday.  However, attorneys with the U.S. Department of Justice moved to keep Zhao in the U.S., arguing he could be a flight risk if he leaves the country, noting that he still has a vast amount of wealth and that there's no extradition treaty between the U.S. and the UAE. They are not pushing to put him in jail ahead of his Feb. 23, 2024 sentencing. Judge Jones did not indicate if he would schedule a hearing or when he might otherwise rule on the motion in Monday's hearing.  Zhao's attorneys argued that he had already demonstrated his intent to take responsibility by coming to the U.S. to plead guilty in the first place.  His wife and children cannot relocate for a few months just for sentencing, they said.  Zhao faces anywhere from a few months to as many as 10 years in prison, the DOJ said, though Zhao can appeal any sentence longer than 18 months.  He also agreed to pay a $50 million fine as part of his plea agreement.

Bitcoin URPD Suggests $47,360 Holds Next Major Resistance After $38,500 In a new post on X, analyst Ali talked about what the levels ahead of BTC are looking like right now in terms of the on-chain resistance. The indicator of interest here is the “UTXO Realized Price Distribution” (URPD), which tells us about the amount of coins (or more precisely, the UTXOs) that were last acquired at the various levels that the cryptocurrency has visited in its history. Generally, the levels that host the cost basis of a significant number of investors can be important levels for Bitcoin, due to how investor psychology tends to work. Related Reading: Will Recent Binance Events Trigger This Historical Bitcoin Bull Run Signal? To any holder, their acquisition price is naturally a level that’s important, so whenever the price retests that point, they may become more prone to make some sort of move. How they may react to the retest may depend on what their profitability status was prior to the retest. An investor who was in profits before might want to take a further gamble and buy more, as they may think that the price would go up again in the near term. On the other hand, a holder who was in losses might just want to exit at their acquisition price, just so they can at least avoid going into losses again in the future. Such buying or selling that arises out of these retests can provide support or resistance to the asset’s price. As mentioned before, though, only levels with a large number of investors are really of any relevance to BTC, as just a few users making these buy or sell moves won’t tick the price meaningfully. The below chart shows the data for the Bitcoin URPD, to see where the major centers of holder cost basis lie. Looks like the the level just ahead hosts the cost basis of a significant amount of UTXOs | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the $37,000 level holds the cost basis of a large number of UTXOs, suggesting that the mark should prove to be a strong support wall for the cryptocurrency. This is certainly an optimistic sign for the rally, as it means that BTC might be able to hold itself above this level without too much effort and work at building an upward move. Related Reading: Ethereum Conquers $2,100: On-Chain Data Paints Path To $2,400 The next level that might pose any major resistance could be $38,500, but if Bitcoin can successfully clear this wall, the levels ahead are relatively thin with investors. From the chart, it’s visible that above $47,000 is where the next resistance boundary lies. So Ali thinks that if a break above $38,500 happens, BTC could advance toward this level. BTC Price Bitcoin has slumped back toward the $37,000 level, but if the on-chain data explained earlier is anything to refer to, the asset should find support here.

42391993,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfyByj,1701109733,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs Have Almost $100M in AUM in Brazil, Led by Hashdex Offering","As investors continue to await approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., a check of Brazil finds hefty demand for such vehicles which have been trading in that country for more than two years.  Together, those ETFs have $96.8 million of assets under management (AUM) as of November 21, led by Hashdex's Nasdaq Bitcoin Reference Price FDI (BITH11) with $57.8 million in AUM as of November 21, or a market share of about 60%. As comparison, the largest ETF in the nation, iShares Ibovespa Index (BOVA11), has $2.41 billion in AUM and the second largest, the iShares BM&FBOVESPA Small Cap (SMAL11), has $1.19 billion in AUM. For reference, the largest U.S. ETF, the SPDR S&P 500, has roughly $430 billion in AUM.  According to Marcelo Sampaio, CEO and founder of Hashdex, the success of bitcoin ETFs in Brazil is the result of pro-market digital assets regulation and growing interest from large institutions for said products.  “There is a growing positive sentiment across the most sophisticated investors and we’ve been seeing increasing interest from some of the largest institutions whether that be either allocating or considering adding crypto soon to their portfolios,” said Sampaio in an interview with CoinDesk. Hashdex’s spot bitcoin ETF started trading on August 1, 2021.  Hashdex also offers a crypto index ETF that includes BTC, ETH and other cryptos and which garners a lot more investment than the spot bitcoin ETF, said Sampaio. Combined, Hashdex’s crypto-related ETF AUM is currently around $500 million.  Hashdex is also among those with outstanding applications for spot bitcoin ETFs with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency – as it's done with other applicants of late – last week delayed any decision on the Hashdex filing.  Other spot bitcoin ETF providers in Brazil include Itau ́ Asset Management, which teamed up with Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital to launch a fund last year, and an offering from QR Capital, which launched in 2021, has $36 million in AUM, according to data from Hashdex.  There has traditionally been a lot of interest in crypto ETFs from the Brazilian public, said Gui Silva, a managing partner at Tagus Capital, and the number of investors in digital asset ETFs will only continue to grow.  “There are about 4 million investors with accounts at the B3 stock exchange in Brazil and around 700,000 of these invest in ETFs,"" he said. ""About one-third of those investors allocated funds to crypto ETFs last year.""  A reason for the strong appetite in ETF investing in Brazil might be due to the low fees, according to Silva. “ETF fees in Brazil range from 0.5% to 1.5% - which is considered relatively low compared to other products in the market,” he added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/27/spot-bitcoin-etfs-have-almost-100m-in-aum-in-brazil-led-by-hashdex-offering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e533175da7a2e975afca30dc6fa6652529e539c8-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20776327,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562660,1701108041,Circle And SBI Holdings Partnership To Boost USDC In Japan,"Global financial firm Circle has announced a strategic partnership with the Japanese financial services SBI Holdings, Inc., to promote the adoption of Circle’s USDC stablecoin and web3 services in Japan. Circle Joins SBI Holdings In A Memorandum Of Understanding According to the announcement, both parties have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) toward promoting UDSC‘s adoption in the country. Due to this, both parties are also committed to accurately abiding by stablecoin-related regulations and communication with authorities. The announcement read: The companies have signed an MOU underpinning the work ahead, which includes SBI Group and Circle initially working towards the circulation of USDC and expanding the use of stablecoins in Japan. SBI Group and Circle have also committed to properly complying with stablecoin-related regulations, including communication with authorities. Circle’s partnership with SBI Holdings comes amid the Japanese government’s goal of encouraging the expansion of the Web3 business and enacting new stablecoin rules. In June, Japan’s updated Payment Services Act was published, emphasizing stablecoin regulation. Related Reading: USDC Expands to 6 Chains, Boosted by Coinbase; Crypto Project With Impressive AI Technology Poised for Recognition The Revised Payment Service Act focuses on stablecoin issuance and circulation in Japan as it moves toward a Web3 economy. As a global leader in the digital asset economy, the Japanese government revised the Payment Services Act (the Revised Payment Services Act), on June 3, 2023, to establish regulations for stablecoins. The regulation is expected to stimulate the issuance and circulation of stablecoins in Japan and advance Japan’s transition towards a Web3 economy. Furthermore, it creates “collateralized” stablecoins that are backed by legal tender. This way, Circle’s USDC goes a step further because it is backed 100% by highly liquid cash and cash-equivalent assets and is always convertible 1 to 1 for US dollars. The announcement also highlighted a banking relationship between Circle and SBI Shinsei Bank. This is because the SBI Shinsei bank will provide banking services to the firm. As a result of this, USDC and liquidity become accessible for users and businesses in Japan. Furthermore, SBI Group will embrace Circle’s Web3 Services solutions into its digital asset portfolio strategy. These include Programmable Wallet, smart contract management tools, and blockchain infrastructure. The Company’s CEO On The Partnership Circle’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jeremy Allaire has expressed his pleasure in the recent collaboration with SBI Holdings. The CEO has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to share his optimism on the partnership. Related Reading: Base Network Gears Up For USDC Integration, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire Confirms According to him, the partnership exhibits a shared vision for digital currency’s future. The partnership also marks a significant milestone for Circle, as it plans to expand in Japan and Asia Pacific. Allaire stated: Our partnership with SBI Holdings represents a shared vision for the future of digital currency and is a significant milestone in Circle’s expansion plans in Japan and the Asia Pacific. We are excited to collaborate with SBI towards setting new standards in the financial sector in Japan. So far, SBI Holdings is requesting registration as an electronic payment instruments service, as this is subject to approval by the authorities.

Over 160 state-issued currencies have limited acceptance outside their host jurisdictions, creating liquidity and acceptance challenges. Bitcoin and stablecoins are providing solutions to the problem of limited access to better money, particularly in developing countries, and are gaining adoption. This article analyzes how new monetary technologies have significant potential to disrupt the existing legacy money system over the next years and decades. To the extent that this occurs, it would have macroeconomic implications and would offer investment opportunity along the way. 160 Different Currency Bubbles There are over 160 different state-issued currencies in the world, and most of them have little or no acceptance outside of their host jurisdictions. Within each jurisdiction, they have a monopoly and thus widespread liquidity and acceptance, but then those attributes fall off very quickly outside of their borders. In some sense, most currencies are like casino chips or arcade tokens: easily spendable or convertible in that arcade or casino, but of little use or salability anywhere else. As I write this piece from a U.S. suburb, it would take a nontrivial amount of time and effort to find a conversion point for my paper Egyptian pounds or Norwegian kroner. And if I could somehow find someone willing to take them off my hands for me, perhaps my bank if I happen to be a customer of a national chain (rather than a local bank), it probably would be with substantial fees. That’s the price to pay for very low salability. For all intents and purposes, it stops being money too far out of their borders. Lyn Alden U.S. dollars, being the world reserve currency, are different. If you bring dollars with you to most countries, it wouldn’t be too hard to find a broker to convert them for you, or even a merchant to take them directly. The dollar is by far the world’s most salable currency. The second most salable global bearer asset would likely be a sovereign gold coin. It could be a South African krugerrand or an American gold eagle, but if you bring something like that with you in most places, it shouldn’t be too hard to find a point of conversion. And then there’s a big gap, with the euro being the next best, a few other large currencies, and then a long tail of duds. Mostly we just use our Visa card, which is a non-bearer payment method. I swipe my card, and this credit-based signaling mechanism transfers dollars into the merchant’s local currency. This arrangement of 160+ different currency monopolies can be a real problem depending on what country you happen to be born into. Egypt, for example, is a country that I love and have a second home in, but it has about 20% broad money supply growth per year, and sustained high price inflation because of it. Trading Economics And that seems benign relative to Turkiye, which has increased their broad money supply by about 6x in the past four years: Trading Economics Prices are what allow people to coordinate, and when money supply keeps increasing at such a fast rate, it is highly disruptive for economic coordination. In addition to constantly diluting peoples’ liquid savings with negative real interest rates, this money supply growth constantly dilutes peoples’ wages. If they are not aggressively seeking higher wages year after year, they’re falling behind in international purchasing power terms. If small businesses are not aggressively raising prices, they’re falling behind as well. If landlords are not aggressively raising rents, their real estate investment is unlikely to keep up with international purchasing power. It’s like being on a treadmill at full-speed, trying desperately to keep up. If you aren’t aggressively seeking out ways to increase your income and protect your savings, you’re getting diluted away. And it’s especially harsh for the least financially secure people. They’re the ones that often don’t have bank accounts, and are dealing with paper cash without even earning interest on their savings that keep devaluing. Upper-middle classes are more likely to have access to interest-bearing savings accounts that can mitigate some of the dilution, and are more likely to have access to credit, meaning they can basically short the local currency in order to buy property and other assets. Altogether, it creates a pretty strong effect to continually dilute those who are not arbitraging the money toward those who are. According to Trading Economics, which compiles global inflation data and other economic data, there are over 30 countries that currently have double-digit price inflation, and by rough estimation they have about a billion people in them. In many of these countries, it is a chronic issue. Trading Economics In these countries, it is often hard to get your hands on better money. This is because governments control the only two primary ways to get money in or out. The first way to bring money in or out of a country is through a port of entry, which today mostly means airports. However, bringing physical cash or gold with you is generally restricted to a rather modest amount. The second way to is to do to a bank wire transfer, or use a fintech platform that serves as an overlay to a bank wire. Much like ports of entry, governments have tight control over what sorts of wires they allow and whether they force their citizens to convert into their local currency or not. Much like we have a “blood-brain barrier”, national banking systems also have a barrier between their local currency and the outside world, and they can choose how porous or restricted that is. The majority of people in these countries tend to only have bank accounts in local currency, so any payments that they receive get turned into local currency. National governments and banking systems can determine how hard it is to get a dollar bank account, and to what extent (if any) that global dollar-based money transmitters like Western Union can operate within their borders. If I pay a graphic designer in a given country, then even though they might price their services in dollars, whether they can actually receive in dollars is largely up to their country’s government and financial regulators. In many cases, by the time my payment hits their bank account, it’s in their local currency. In many countries, it can be hard to get a dollar bank account, especially if you’re not wealthy. And even if you do have a dollar bank account, they are sometimes prone to forced conversion back into the local currency if the government has a dollar shortage and a lot of dollar-denominated debt. Lyn Alden In other words, governments and corporations in various countries can usually access dollars (unless they are in a sanctioned jurisdiction), but whether normal people in those countries can varies significantly. Those that do access dollars often do so either from 1) relatives who can send them dollar remittances directly with high fees (if allowed by the local government) or 2) on the black market. In many countries with high inflation, there are street markets for physical cash dollars. People will buy them and literally store them under their mattress. In most countries it’s not a crime to do this, but it is often a crime to be a cash dollar broker. These street transactions are often handled like marijuana transactions basically, like shady little transactions based on word of mouth that come with some risk. All of this effort just because people want some dollars for liquid savings, and either don’t have a direct source for dollar remittances, or those remittances get converted to local currency. In many countries, the wealthy citizens have offshore bank accounts, offshore brokerage accounts, foreign property, and so forth. All of that relies on credit and a long chain of international counterparties. But then the lower you go down the income and wealth spectrum, the more people are likely to be stuck entirely within the confines of the local currency, and toward the bottom are people that are stuck purely in local cash without even the benefit of interest or credit to offset some of the ongoing inflation. Their wages and their savings are stuck in a constant spiral of dilution, with their economic value and the accumulated fruits of their work constantly taken from them in an opaque way. Opening the Gates The inventions of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and dollar stablecoins are beginning to circumvent this problem. The governments of these countries don’t generally like it, but the people do. On the Chainalysis crypto adoption index , 16 of the top 20 countries ranked by crypto adoption are classified as developing countries. In developed markets, people often view bitcoin and stablecoins as a solution in search of a problem, but that’s because our money problems have historically been subtle most of the time. For people in developing countries, their money problems tend to be more obvious, with either high inflation, high financial authoritarianism, or both. The sweet spot for crypto adoption is countries that have some significant tech savvy population centers, and that also deal with bad local money. With these technologies, I can for example pay a foreign graphic designer directly in bitcoin, dollar stablecoins, or whatever she wants. It goes to her, and goes around her country’s banking system. She can show me a QR code over a video call, and I can pay her on the spot. She can send me an email or DM with a digital address to send money to. If we do this over the Lightning network, it’ll cost next to nothing in fees. There are more and more hubs around the world with merchants that accept bitcoin or stablecoins, or that can convert them into local currency should someone have a need to. And for ports of entry, someone can write down or memorize twelve words, or store them in an encrypted file in a cloud somewhere (representing their private keys), and bring infinite value density with them. Whenever I see airport signs that say “cash only allowed up to 10,000 USD” I kind of look around and think, “how do they know that none of us in this line have a million dollars worth of bitcoin or stablecoins with us, or that are otherwise accessible to us?” In other words, the gates were built for an analog world, and the analog walls that those gates protect are becoming increasingly porous. And for most countries, those walls and gates were designed to keep people in ; to make it hard for them to access better money. Now with bitcoin and stablecoins it’s easier for them to do so. Lyn Alden And only in the past several years has this become relevant, because for nearly the first decade of this technology’s existence, the liquidity and size of these networks was tiny. Only once these networks reached tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization, with billions of dollars per day in active volume, do they start to become anything other than a novelty for most people. Bitcoin now has a market capitalization of about $700 billion despite being in a bear market, and stablecoins have a market capitalization of about $120 billion. The biggest stablecoin issuer is reported by its auditor to hold $56 billion in T-bills, which is more than all but the top two dozen countries as recorded by the U.S. Treasury . They serve as an offshore bank account for the middle class of many countries. Governments could try to ban their local populations from using these technologies by making it illegal to do so, but it’s hard to enforce. Inflation and capital controls tend to be effective specifically because they are opaque and are happening behind the scenes. But when people finally have a peer-to-peer solution that solves these problems, and a government tries to tell them they can’t, well, that lays their cards on the table and makes it more obvious. In a given country, there are only a handful of major international banks and a longer tail of smaller domestic banks, and they are easy to regulate. But when trying to regulate what individuals do, then the number of enforcement points are in the millions. When most people, including traditional finance professionals, think of “crypto”, they lump everything together in their head. Bitcoin, stablecoins, monkey jpegs, VC-funded token pump-and-dumps, and scammy yield-farming Ponzis are all categorized similarly. But what I would argue, and have argued for years now, is that the killer app for this technology is money: savings and payments. Bitcoin is a powerful innovation with long-term potential. Stablecoins have been a powerful bridging tool as well. From a macroeconomic perspective, if these technologies continue to gain adoption over time as they have for 10-15 years now, I think it will eventually make the long tail of these 160+ currency monopolies harder to maintain. In a digitally-connected global economy, people will have much easier access to better money that has global liquidity and salability to it. People everywhere will have more of a choice, as long as they have access to the internet in various ways. Imagine the impact that these technologies could have in five or ten years when they are likely far larger and better understood. They also allow for micropayments, including international micropayments. Up until fairly recently, it has not generally been possible to send someone the equivalent of ten cents internationally. But for example with the combination of Chaumian e-cash and the Lightning network, that’s possible. Why would anyone want to do that? Well, maybe they want to pay per question for ChatGPT from a developing country, and the monthly subscription is not affordable to them. I’ve played with e-cash apps that make this easily possible. Or maybe more broadly, individual AI agents deployed and operating around the world might want to pay each other across borders in real-time, for things like API usage, GPU usage, or otherwise. Even for slightly larger remittance-scale international payments (often a couple hundred bucks), the average fee is 6.2% , which harms the people who can least afford to pay it. Open-source money can reduce the overhead for sending cross-border transactions. Africa has over 40 currencies. Latin America has over 30 currencies. All of these financial borders and conversion barriers act as friction points and economic siloes. And over time they are gradually being more circumvented. They are legacy technology, and they will likely be increasingly hard to enforce in the future. Bitcoin vs Stablecoins The main difference between Bitcoin and stablecoins is that Bitcoin is optimized for decentralization and hardness but is currently volatile due to being a novel unit of account, whereas stablecoins are less-volatile because they piggy-back on existing monetary network effects, but are centralized and inflationary. However, an important aspect of stablecoins is that their central hub can be placed in any good jurisdiction, and then penetrate into other jurisdictions. For example, dollar stablecoin issuers can operate in the United States, Switzerland, Dubai, or wherever they are welcomed. Other real-world assets can be tokenized too, to the extent that there is market demand for them. For example, there are gold-backed stablecoins operating out of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. There are tokenized T-bills that pass on most of the underlying yield to the holder. For these stablecoin issuers, what primarily matters is whether their operating jurisdiction welcomes them or not. For example, a stablecoin operator (dollars, gold, or whatever) can operate out of Switzerland, while Argentinians and Turks can use the tokens to protect themselves from inflation, and there’s not a whole lot that the governments of Argentina or Turkey can do about it, as long as the government of Switzerland is fine with it. Argentinians and Turks can make or receive international payments, can buy tokens from brokers and use them for savings, can bring their money portably with them if they move somewhere else, etc. These are all basically digital banknotes. For this reason, the issuers of these tokens have to comply with laws of their operating jurisdiction, as well as certain international laws (especially if using dollars). That could mean freezing certain assets associated with crime, or blocking most of the use in sanctioned jurisdictions. And of course, the issuer and their auditors must be trusted. Token issuers can go insolvent and default on their users if they make mistakes or act without integrity. The biggest stablecoin has been operating for over nine years and continues to meet all customer redemptions and maintain its peg, and the second-biggest stablecoin has been operating for over five years and continues to meet all customer redemptions and maintain its peg. That doesn’t mean there’s not solvency risk in the future, though. Bitcoin is different in the sense that it has no central hub, and its supply asymptotically approaches 21 million with a hard cap (whereas dollars historically grow in supply at 7% per year and have unlimited eventual supply). Someone who holds their own private keys for their bitcoin truly has a bearer asset that is not reliant on credit; it is only reliant on the decentralized network as a whole remaining operational and uncaptured. Lyn Alden, with Glassnode Data China has “banned” bitcoin mining on multiple occasions but it never really stuck. Eventually in 2021 they went more all-out on it, and were more successful this time. China was the largest bitcoin mining jurisdiction by far, and within a matter of weeks, about half of Bitcoin’s global mining network went offline. YCharts Over the next two years, the Bitcoin network basically said, “hold my beer and watch what’s about to happen,” and its mining capacity exploded to the upside, meaning its total network processing power tripled. Even during the initial shock, the Bitcoin network maintained 100% operational uptime. It just slowed down mildly for a couple weeks until the automatic difficulty adjustment kicked in. If Microsoft or Amazon were given two weeks notice that they had to move all of their servers out of the United States, imagine the magnitude and duration of the disruption of their services that would ensue. But Bitcoin, being more decentralized, maintained 100% uptime. The machines eventually dispersed like a swarm to other jurisdictions and gradually came back online, and the network became more decentralized as a result. Meanwhile, stablecoins started on a layer on top of the Bitcoin network in 2014, gravitated toward Ethereum, and then gravitated toward Tron. Basically, since they are centralized anyway, they go to wherever fees are cheap, settlements are fast, and liquidity network effects are present. And among stablecoin issuers, only the largest issuers tend to capture most of the market share, due to token-level liquidity network effects. Historically, the two main use cases for stablecoins have been for 1) speculation and 2) utility. -The speculation use-case is mainly in offshore exchanges or DeFi projects. In offshore exchanges, they are often used as a unit of account and for holding cash balances in active crypto trading. In DeFi projects, they are also used for leveraging and yield farming. A lot of this usage still happens on Ethereum. -The utility angle use-case is mainly around developing countries for use as payments and savings, as previously described. A lot of this usage has gravitated toward Tron, where it’s cheaper. And amid the current crypto bear market that has been running for 2+ years since the top of the market cycle in 2021, the DeFi use-case has been stagnating, but the developing market payments/savings use case continues to gain strength. This can be somewhat visualized by looking at the different market capitalizations of USDC (often used by wealthier traders, and often on Ethereum) vs USDT (often used in developing countries, and often on Tron): Coin Market Cap In his recent documentary , journalist Peter McCormack traveled to Argentina to interview people about their ongoing inflation problem, and explored how people there specifically want USDT on Tron during dollar conversions (with that chapter starting at the 10:46 mark). Should someone hold their entire net worth in stablecoins? No. They’re vulnerable to changes in regulation by the United States, and rely on centralized international issuers. But the way a lot of people use them in inflationary environments is that they’ll have a bit of local currency for near-term expenses, a moderate amount of stablecoins for intermediate-term liquid savings, and then other assets like bitcoin for longer-term liquid savings, or rely more heavily on less-liquid assets like real estate. Announced by Lightning Labs in 2022, Taproot Assets has the potential to create yet another shift of where stablecoin usage ends up, and bring some of it back to Bitcoin. The Bitcoin main-net beta version of Taproot Assets went live last month, and it is expected to be usable on Bitcoin’s Lightning network soon. If it is successfully deployed and adopted, this will allow stablecoins to flow more natively across existing Bitcoin/Lightning network liquidity. For example, if or when this gets deployed, someone can have a Taproot Asset stablecoin channel on the periphery of the Lightning network, send a payment to someone through the Lightning network’s core Bitcoin-denominated liquidity, and then the receiver on the other side could receive bitcoins, could receive stablecoins of the same currency, or could receive stablecoins of another currency. Many wallets can let people hold bitcoin and stablecoins and thus make the choice on what they want to hold for a given purpose. Lightning Labs Basically, this overall technology from the Bitcoin network itself to stablecoins on various networks gives the world a new form of harder decentralized global self-custodial money, and then also gives people in developing countries access to the best developed-country currencies and assets, and market participants can sort out what ratio of those things makes sense for them. Realistic Adoption Patterns Skeptics often point out that Bitcoin is volatile. That’s a fair point, and that’s also why stablecoins have a significant degree of market-driven popularity today despite their ongoing supply inflation and their reliance on third-party operators. But realistically, an emerging form of money can’t have its market capitalization go from being worth zero to being worth trillions of dollars without upward volatility, and with upward volatility will come leverage and periods of downward volatility. I would argue that over-emphasizing volatility as a problem, is to miss the forest by focusing too much on the trees. Most technologies have a pretty smooth adoption curve. When people get electricity in their region and their house, buy a radio, buy a television, start using the internet, or start using smartphones, they rarely ever go back to not using them. They don’t de-adopt a technology. Outside of economic calamities (like the Great Depression), the adoption curve tends to be smooth and up. Sometimes it takes as little as 15 years, and sometimes it takes upward of 45 years, but it rarely moves backward. Nicholas Felton, NYT, retrieved from HBR If we were to extend that chart into the present day, we’d see similar smooth curves for media streaming, social media, smart phones, and AI. But adoption of new, decentralized money is inherently different. If it starts to adopt and go up too smoothly, people will leverage it, and thus they will turn into forced-sellers if the price goes down. Other people will get overly-excited and buy too much during a period of mania without fully understanding what they’re buying. Some people will build outright frauds or Ponzi schemes on top of it or adjacent to it. And then that period will exhaust itself and create a ton of downward volatility and liquidations. Unlike most technologies, some people will become disillusioned with it and de-adopt it. They buy at the top, and sell at the bottom, and wash their hands of this technology, at least for a while. I’m not aware of any other asset that has drawn down over 75% on three separate occasions and eventually went back to much higher highs. Bitcoin has done this, and in the next couple of years it might do it for the fourth time. Look Into Bitcoin Every time Bitcoin has one of its manias over its 15-year lifecycle so far, people compare it to the infamous tulip bubble, but the thing about the tulip bubble is that it was brief and didn’t keep coming back. Like most bubbles, it was one-and-done. Usually if an investment falls 75%, it never sees new all-time highs again. Some of the best-ever investments, like Amazon stock, often manage to come back from that magnitude of a drawdown once , like after the Dotcom bubble. Bitcoin has uniquely done it three separate times over almost 15 years, and is likely working its way out of the fourth as I write this. But naturally this elongates the adoption pattern. Rather than taking one decade to reach its eventual market saturation as some fast-growing (15-year) technologies do, to the extent that it’s successful, it’ll take multiple decades. Judging from where we are now, it’ll be over two decades at the bare minimum, and I would assume over three decades. Meanwhile, Bitcoin also faces periods of market dilution from thousands of other cryptocurrencies. Whenever there is a raging bull market, people introduce and market other types of coins, claiming to be better in some way. In reality, they usually sacrifice some degree of decentralization or security to maximize some other variable like speed or programmability. So far, out of over 20,000 cryptocurrencies, only about three of them have ever made a higher-high in bitcoin-denominated terms in the next market cycle. Instead, they tend to have their 15 minutes of fame, and then stagnate forever. Bitcoin has required time to shake off these token dilutions in each cycle, as its own liquidity and network effect grind higher and higher. And we should visualize this in terms of liquidity as well. When bitcoin had thousands of dollars worth of daily trading volume, someone couldn’t just buy a million bucks worth of it. It would barely be on their radar. Similarly, when bitcoin had millions of dollars of daily trading volume, someone couldn’t just buy a billion bucks worth of it. Now that it has billions of dollars worth of daily trading volume, the largest pools of capital still can’t just buy a ton of it right away. The larger its market capitalization and liquidity get, the more capable the network becomes at attracting even larger pools of capital. With at most a couple hundred million people that own it globally based on the reported number of accounts at the world's largest exchanges, Bitcoin has something like a 2-3% adoption rate or less. But most of that “adoption” is just having a little bit of it sitting on an exchange or custodian, that they treat as a speculation. More directly, there are about 4.5 million addresses with at least 0.1 bitcoins (currently worth about $3.7k USD), and since some people have many addresses, it means significantly fewer than 4.5 million people directly self-custody at least 0.1 bitcoins. If the day comes where bitcoin is held by a third of people or half of people in the world in some capacity, it’ll likely be a lot less volatile, both in terms of upward volatility and downward volatility. For now, it’s still in the early adopter phase for those willing to consider the future and take on some degree of uncertainty, and shakes out people who buy too much relative to their volatility tolerance, or people who leverage it too greedily. And as long as there are legal tender laws which tax most purchases or sales of non-legal-tender assets, then the overall volume of bitcoin-denominated medium-of-exchange usage is likely to come later. People first turn toward it as a type of globally-portable self-custodial savings, since that is the bigger problem that most people face, and then only start using it for payments if it solves a particular need that they have. What bitcoin represents for many holders at this stage of its adoption cycle is optionality ; they have a globally-portable and rather liquid asset that, almost wherever they bring it in the world, they can find a merchant in an urban center who would accept it for goods and services, or can find a broker to convert it into the local fiat currency. Unlike most investments, I personally treat my cold-storage bitcoin holdings like money, rather than like an investment. I’ve recommended it and owned it since April 2020 at $6,900 per coin, and asking me when I would sell the bulk of my bitcoin is like asking when I would sell the bulk of my dollars. As long as I work in the United States and the dollar is their legal tender, I’ll be using dollars in some capacity. Similarly, as long as the Bitcoin network continues to be decentralized, secure, and the best at what it does, I’ll be using bitcoin in some capacity. When would I sell some of my globally-portable liquid money with a hard-capped supply? Either if there is a problem with the network, or because there is something I want to buy with my money that appeals to me more than savings, like a consumer good or an investment security. So what do I monitor when it comes to the Bitcoin network? I look for technical risk (anything that might be able to damage its decentralization and security), I look for regulation risk from major economic powers that could set its adoption back a bit longer, and I look for periods of mania. If the day ever comes where it has moved beyond these risks, it certainly won’t be at today’s price anymore.

20774690,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562586,1701104428,"Renowned Finance Author Says Buy Bitcoin Now Before It’s Too Late, Here’s Why","Renowned finance author Robert Kiyosaki has never been shy about his support for Bitcoin and he continues to push for more adoption of the asset. Kiyosaki who wrote the infamous ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ book is back once again with a piece of advice, and a warning, for investors regarding Bitcoin. Buy Bitcoin Now, Says Kiyosaki In normal fashion, Kiyosaki took to Twitter to sound the warning about rising prices due to inflation. This tweet was made back on November 23 where the author lamented the reality of individuals who are having to live paycheck to paycheck and are unable to hedge their wealth against inflation by buying Bitcoin, alongside Gold and Silver. Related Reading: XRP Price May Recapture 61,000% Surge Seen In 2017, Analyst Claims Then in a November 26 post, Kiyosaki once again reiterated the importance of owning Bitcoin. As the finance author explained, it will be good news when the price of Gold reaches a new high. However, those who will suffer are workers and savers. Instead of just saving straight in dollars, the best-selling author advises that individuals put their money into assets such as Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin. Kiyosaki refers to the monetary system as a “FAKE money system”, advising people to get out before it’s too late. Great News Gold reaches new high. Bad News: Workers and savers are losers. Bad News: been saying the same for 25- years. Don’t be a loser. Get out of FAKE money system. Get into gold, silver, Bitcoin now…. Before it’s too late. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 26, 2023 This is on brand for Kiyosaki whose message over the years has not changed. Instead of saving in dollars that are expected to keep depreciating, the author lobbies for better ways to store wealth, with Bitcoin always leading the charge. BTC Price Will Soar To 6-Digits Kiyosaki’s bullishness on Bitcoin and why he advises investors to utilize this asset shines through in his predictions for the future price. In October, Kiyosaki predicted that the price of Bitcoin would reach as high as $135,000 a piece especially as the price of Gold began to trend higher. This prediction pads up his earlier forecast from August 2023 where the author said the BTC price could reach 7-digits. He said the asset, which he refers to as ‘God’s money’, could cross the $1 million mark, and at the same time, the price of Gold could cross $75,000 while Silver will rally to $60,000. Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver are not the only assets that Kiyosaki is bullish on, however, as tech giant Apple has caught his attention. This comes after Apple CEO Tim Cook sold his shares of the company. As the price fell, Kiyosaki put forward that Apple shares may be a good buy if the price were to drop below $150. However, Apple stock failed to breach this mark and has since risen back above $189 per share.

Bitcoin fund inflows surpassed $1.5 billion this year amid signs of short-seller capitulation.  Ether and Solana led among altcoins fund inflows.  Crypto investment funds last week attracted their largest net inflows this year, extending their strongest run since the 2021 bull market as anticipation for a spot bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded fund (ETF) continued to entice investors, digital asset fund management firm CoinShares reported Monday.  Digital asset-focused investment vehicles saw net inflows of $346 million in the week ended Nov. 24, the largest amount in what's now been nine consecutive weeks of inflows, according to the report.

20773023,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562655,1701100820,Cosmos Co-Founder’s Controversial Proposal Triggers 11% Plunge In ATOM,"In a bold move, Cosmos co-founder Jae Kwon has called for a significant shift in the blockchain’s direction following the controversial passing of NWV #848. This proposal was approved by the community’s voting mechanism, earning around 40% of the votes, and it was aimed at changing the blockchain’s native token inflation rate. Related Reading: Cosmos (ATOM) Bears Dominate As Bulls Struggle To Drive Price Kwon, expressing his dissent, is now advocating for a coordinated “split” in the Cosmos ecosystem, a proposal that could reshape the blockchain’s future. This development comes in response to what Kwon perceives as “deviating from the network’s core principles.” “AtomOne” Split, Cosmos Co-Founder Urges Community Engagement Kwon’s proposal, termed “AtomOne,” is not just a divergence but an exodus from the current state of Cosmos, encouraging community members who voted ‘No’ to join this new venture. The plan is still in its infancy and laid out in a GitHub repository, where Kwon invites community ideas and participation in shaping this new direction. He emphasizes a collaborative approach, urging the community to discuss and contribute to the formation of AtomOne. The essence of AtomOne lies in integrating $ATOM with $ATMO/$ATOM1, aiming to prevent a “complete collapse of ATOM by mass selling.” Kwon suggests that instead of abandoning ATOM altogether, there should be a way for it to coexist with the new fork. Cosmos Community Faces a Crossroads: Exodus And Innovation Kwon’s vision for AtomOne involves forking the current “cosmoshub4” but with its development path and teams, aiming for a more decentralized structure than the current Gaia. This new entity is open to all who opposed the recent vote, signaling a departure from the traditional paths of blockchain governance. Kwon highlights the power of the minority in blockchain ecosystems and the ability to self-organize and create antifragile structures. His message is clear: those who do not align with sound logic are destined to fail, and the future belongs to those who dare to exodus and build a better civilization. Kwon assures that this move isn’t about abandoning the original Cosmos hub but saving it and redefining its role. People are completely confused about the nature of blockchains what power the NO/NWV voters have altogether inside and outside the hub. The reality is that we exist, our principles and goals are aligned because they come from logic and we are about to demonstrate antifragility. The reality is that you cannot take control of a chain even with over 50% consensus, even 67%, because the minority can always self-organize even without your help. And the reality is that those who don’t make decisions based on sound logic always end up failing in the end. As the community gears up for this potential split, Kwon’s call for a departure to AtomOne reflects a pivotal moment in Cosmos’ history and a testament to blockchain governance’s dynamic and evolving nature. A conversation that will continue for “generations.” Related Reading: Cosmos Has A Grand Plan For 2024: Will It Crush Ethereum? As a result of the split proposal, ATOM has seen a spike in volatility, recording an 11% loss over the past few days. However, speculation is that the split will involve an airdrop poised to attract positive attention for the token.

20771361,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562592,1701097201,The Dogecoin Surge: Unveiling The Catalyst Behind Rising Transactions,"In the last month, Dogecoin (DOGE) has observed a notable upswing in transactions surpassing the $100,000 mark, coinciding with a substantial surge in the price of this meme-based cryptocurrency. The abrupt increase in both transaction volume and price suggests a heightened level of interest in Dogecoin, particularly from major financial entities recognized as “whales” and institutional investors. Billy Markus, an IT engineer, co-created the prominent meme-based cryptocurrency alongside Jackson Palmer in 2013. Originally conceived as a satirical imitation of Bitcoin, Markus has recently offered his perspective on the significant surge in daily DOGE transactions, which surpassed 1 million earlier this week. Dogecoin Transactions Grow The increase in transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain has been formally ascribed to an upsurge in trading of meme coins and an escalation in activity associated with Doginals, as verified by Markus, known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto on X. Related Reading: Analyst’s Crystal Ball: XRP Bulls Eyeing $40 Price Target, Despite Doubts In response to a community member’s concern over the abrupt surge, Markus provided clarification that the upswing in blockchain transactions is causally connected to the heightened trading activity of meme coins and the active participation of Doginals inside the Dogecoin ecosystem.

This uptick suggests increased interest in #DOGE from institutional players and whales, potentially gearing up for a significant price spike. pic.twitter.com/UpxVkfu9hW — Ali (@ali_charts) November 23, 2023 Meanwhile, the data presented by Blockchair substantiates the record achieved by DOGE. Markus suggested that the primary rationale behind this phenomenon is the active utilization of the Dogecoin blockchain for the purpose of transferring Ordinals and low-value cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin transaction count chart. Source: Blockchair The Doginals experiment was initially introduced in the month of May. During that period, the developers expressed their intention for it to function as a faithful replication of Bitcoin Ordinals. The experiment yielded successful results, which is of notable interest. Users possessed the capability to engrave both images and textual content onto the Dogecoin blockchain. Doginals refer to the constituent components of Dogecoin, wherein every element represents a distinct entity known as a “Shibe” within the underlying Dogecoin network. These components are further distinguished by the inclusion of additional data, such as textual information or visual imagery. Image: Doginals FEPE, Medium. Overview Of The Doginals DRC20 Standard The recently introduced Doginals DRC20 standard enables Dogecoin nodes to encode data onto individual Shibe entities, resulting in the creation of a Doginal. The term “Shibe” has a parallelism with the Bitcoin counterparts “Satoshi” or “Sat”. In contrast to Doginals, DRC-20 tokens possess the capability to be exchanged in a manner consistent with conventional cryptocurrencies. The aforementioned S-coins were the subject of Markus’ discourse in his online publication. Related Reading: BLUR Clears The Way With 80% Blowout – Will Price Continue Soaring?

This network which seemingly came out of nowhere has backing from Paradigm, and as its popularity has risen, it has surpassed Base and Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL) in less than a week after launch. Blast TVL Crosses $565 Million The Blast network was officially announced on November 21 and it quickly garnered support from crypto investors. In the first day, the network saw over $81 million in crypto locked. And in two days, the figure had quickly grown above $123 million. Related Reading: Whales Move $30 Million Worth Of XRP To Exchanges – Time To Sell? Despite some of the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) that has followed the launch of the network, investors have continued to bridge their assorted into it. By Sunday, November 26, the total value locked on the Blast network had officially crossed $544 million, according to data from DeFi tracker DeFiLlama. Source: DeFiLlama This figure puts the network’s TVL ahead of older competitors such as Coinbase’s Base. While Blast’s TVL sits at $544 million, the Base TVL is at $338.26 million. This means that Blast’s TVL is currently 60% higher than that of Base. In the same vein, the Blast TVL is also way ahead of that of Cardano. Presently, the Cardano TVL sits at around $330.07 million, just a little lower than Base, and around 61% lower than that of Blast. New L2 Draws Criticism From DeFi Investors Amid the rapid growth that Blast has enjoyed, it has also drawn criticism from DeFi investors. The concerns have ranged from security to how the network is being run. One of the most pertinent criticisms has stemmed from the fact that all of the crypto being bridged to the network will be locked until next year. The network revealed that investors will not be able to access their locked funds until February 2024. In addition, Blast promises users yield on their Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins being bridged to the network, but with no readily discernible way of how this yield will be earned. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF Will Bring $70 Billion In New Money To Trigger Price Rally – Glassnode Some members of the crypto community have, however, figured out that the funds were being deposited into the Lido DAO protocol. Apparently, Blast is currently earning around $1.5 million a month by depositing the bridged funds into Lido. This has further raised concerns about the growing dominance of Lido, which is headed toward 33.3% and could pose a risk for the Ethereum network. Nevertheless, Blast continues to dominate conversations around DeFi on social media. There is now a total of 266,130 ETH locked on the network, with the expectations of an airdrop happening in 2024.

Everybody is in this one square kilometer, which makes it easy to meet up, have conversations and generally enables a good exchange of information.”  Nine Blocks follows a market neutral trading strategy, profiting from arbitrage opportunities and market inefficiencies across the crypto space.  “Being market neutral, we don’t take any directional risk, so whether bitcoin is going up or going to go down doesn't matter much to us,” Arslanian said. “We generate alpha from the inefficiencies in crypto markets.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The discount for Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world’s largest bitcoin investment vehicle, has reached the narrowest point since July 2021 on the optimism of a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved in the U.S. Shares in GBTC have narrowed to an 8.06% discount to the trust’s net asset value (NAV), the closest it has traded to NAV since July 2021, according to data from Ycharts. The fund has traded at a discount since February 2021 and hit record lows near 50% last December. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) that the narrowing is likely prompted by Grayscale's ""updated filings/SEC meeting reported Wed.""  The U.S. Department of Justice doesn't want Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao locked up until sentencing, but does want him to stay in the U.S., arguing in a new filing that he's a ""flight risk that could be managed."" Late last week, CZ's counsel argued that the very fact he – a non-U.S. citizen holding UAE and Canadian passports – voluntarily entered the U.S. to appear before a court indicates that he's not a flight risk. ""Based on all the relevant facts, including Mr. Zhao's voluntary self-surrender, his intent to resolve this case, and the sizable bail package he proposed, Judge Tsuchida found that Mr. Zhao presents no risk of flight, even while residing in the UAE,"" last week's filing said.  News that Metaco, the Swiss digital assets custody firm acquired by Ripple earlier this year, is working with HSBC, one of the world's largest banks, quickly became a reason to be cheerful for many supporters of the U.S. fintech’s ledger protocol, known collectively as the ""XRP army."" Named after the cryptocurrency designed to move liquidity around the XRP Ledger used by Ripple, these avid fans interpret HSBC’s choice of custody tech partner as yet another sign that financial institutions will inevitably adopt XRPL and, crucially, the XRP token. The crypto space is ferociously tribal. Token holders want to believe their blockchain of choice will rise to prominence and deliver a windfall – sometimes to a point that defies logic. For instance, the assumption that Ripple’s recent acquisition spurred HSBC’s decision ignores the fact that Metaco had been courting the bank for over 18 months, according to Adrien Treccani, the Swiss custody firm’s CEO.  Chart of the Day  The notional open interest, or the dollar value locked, in bitcoin's cash-settled futures trading on the CME has topped the $4 billion mark for the first time in at least a year.

20768173,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562631,1701090021,XRP Price Manipulated? Crypto Pundits Alarmed By Market Patterns,"The XRP community is abuzz with discussions of potential price manipulation. This debate is fueled by observations from key figures from the XRP army, who are raising concerns over unusual price patterns despite significant developments. XRP Price Manipulation: The Initial Spark Edward Farina, XRP Healthcare’s Head of Social Adoption, first brought this issue to light. He pointed out that despite Ripple’s consistent flow of positive news and developments over the past year, the price of XRP has remained relatively unmoved. Farina compared this stagnancy to the price behaviors of other cryptocurrencies, which he notes often experience price surges on the back of less impactful news. His statement via X was unequivocal: “So Ripple has [had] major excellent news for the past 12 months and the price of XRP hasn’t budged an inch. Any useless coin as soon as it has a crappy partnership goes up in price. And you still believe the price of XRP isn’t manipulated?” Related Reading: Whales Move $30 Million Worth Of XRP To Exchanges – Time To Sell? The influencer known as WallStreetBulls added to the debate by highlighting recent abrupt changes in the XRP price. He specifically referred to a rapid increase and subsequent decline yesterday, which he alleges was a manipulative pump-and-dump scheme, leading to significant profits for certain players. He stated, “[Yesterday’s] rapid pump and dump of XRP, which resulted in a minimum profit of around $5 million for some, highlights the effectiveness of quick market movements and manipulation for substantial gains.” The crypto pundit further alleges a systematic suppression of XRP’s price. He pointed to an incident where a rumor about a Blackrock ETP correlated with a sudden rise in the XRP price to $0.75, followed by a drop to $0.58, and then a stabilization at $0.60 to $0.62, NewsBTC reported. He interprets this as evidence of deliberate market manipulation by entities with significant financial resources. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Hit $10,000 If It Overtakes SWIFT, Pundit Suggests Previously, in an October 9 post, WallStreetBulls had raised similar concerns, suggesting that a small fraction of “wealthy elites” and “major bankers” were manipulating the market. He claimed that these groups, known for manipulating markets like gold, are now targeting XRP. “There’s a significant market manipulation underway, and it appears that the 0.01% wealthy elite and major bankers are at the helm of it!” the analyst claimed. Despite XRP’s regulatory clarity, especially following a court victory against the SEC, he believes it’s facing undue negative pressure in the market. He also accused several media outlets of launching attacks on XRP, presumably to diminish its value and credibility. Dissenting Voices And The Need For Proof It is important to note that not everyone in the XRP community is agreeing with this view. Crypto analyst Jaydee offered a different perspective in October, suggesting that recent price movements were part of a predictable short-term technical correction rather than evidence of manipulation. “Manipulation? Brotha, we knew this short term correction was coming weeks ago? how does he have all these followers,” he remarked. Moreover, it is crucial to underline that, to date, there is no concrete evidence to substantiate these claims of market manipulation. The inherent volatility of the crypto market leads to price fluctuations, which various factors such as investor sentiment, market trends, and global economic conditions directly influence. As the debate continues, it’s imperative for investors and observers to critically evaluate these claims. At press time, XRP traded at $0.6024.

Firms wishing to provide tokenized funds should ensure they are authorized and the U.K. needs to establish regulatory clarity, the report said.  A group of industry experts on Friday published a report on implementing tokenization of funds that a U.K. regulator welcomed.  The Technology Working Group - which was set up by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury’s Asset Management Taskforce - said firms should ensure their funds are authorized by U.K. regulators, that they hold traditional assets and should be interoperable with future technology.  Tokenized funds offer tokenized shares that represent investors' interest in them and are traded and recorded on distributed ledger technology. Interoperability refers to the ability to transfer tokens between different blockchain networks.  There are several models of fund tokenization that already exist in Europe. Private bank-owned Meltzer Asset Management issued tokens for its domiciled sustainable growth fund in a pilot this year. Archax, a crypto exchange and custody provider, created a tokenized representation of its abrdn money market fund and the company plans to launch a regulated exchange for tokenized assets this year CoinDesk reported last month.  The Financial Conduct Authority is an observer of the group and has supported it, Sarah Pritchard executive director of markets and international at the U.K.'s FCA said in the report.  ""This is an exciting milestone and paves the way for exploring more transformative use cases in the future,"" Pritchard said.  For firms to successfully launch tokenized funds, there needs to be regulatory certainty. Plus, in some cases, firms wishing to use DLT will need to be registered with the FCA and comply with its money laundering rules (MLR) and the FCA is currently exploring whether it could determine MLR applications more quickly for firms already authorized.  The group also said that some tokenization service providers have been unable to obtain banking services and urged the government to consider whether further action needs to be taken.  The Technology Working Group will explore how to further develop its fund tokenization model by the end of the year and will work with regulators to consider impacts on legislation within a year.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/27/uk-regulator-welcomes-fund-tokenization-plan-proposed-by-industry-leaders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28fdc66b53e6c83fe6a0bfcdbc9b2aaf85c8d690-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409372,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGrWJ,1701084766,"Fed Likely to Be Most Dovish Central Bank in 2024, Research Shows","The Fed is expected to cut rates by 100 basis points next year, becoming the most dovish among advanced nations' central banks.  The stance will probably weigh on the dollar. A weaker greenback often incentivizes risk-taking in crypto and traditional markets.  If there is one thing that both crypto and traditional markets love unconditionally, it is cheap fiat liquidity. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the world's most powerful central bank, is likely to take steps in that direction next year.  The Fed is priced to be the most dovish among advanced nation central banks in 2024, with traders anticipating at least 100 basis points – or 1 percentage point – of interest-rate cuts from the current 5.25% to 5.5% range, according to Deutsche Bank Research. That will dent the U.S. dollar's appeal as a relatively high-yielding asset.  According to ING, the U.S. economy and the inflation rate are expected to slow next year, allowing the Fed to pursue a looser monetary policy.  Bank of America, in its Nov. 19 World at Glance report, said the tide is turning for the greenback and ""it can start to adjust broadly lower towards equilibrium"" next year.  ""While we still envision the U.S. performing relatively well next year vis-à-vis other major economies, the prospect of an eventual economic landing and corresponding Fed easing, even alongside easing elsewhere, should provide broad relief to currencies across the globe,"" Bank of America's strategists said.  A weaker dollar often becomes a tailwind to risk assets, including bitcoin, as occurred in the second half of 2020 and early 2021. The greenback is a global reserve currency, playing an outsized role in global trade and non-bank borrowing. When the dollar strengthens, it causes financial tightening worldwide, disincentivizing risk-taking. The opposite is true when it weakens.  The chart shows that most advanced national central banks, led by the Fed, are expected to cut rates next year, having lifted them rapidly in the past 18-20 months to tame inflation.  The coordinated easing could compensate for potential rate hikes by the Bank of Japan, which has been touted as a significant source of uncertainty for crypto and traditional markets. The Japanese central bank has been slowly moving away from its ultra-easy monetary policy this year, although its benchmark rate remains below zero.  Note that heightened expectations for easing mean there's scope for disappointment and a sharp dollar rally should inflation rebound.  ""There are several 'known unknown' scenarios that in aggregate imply a notable risk to our base-case [of weak USD],"" Bank of America's strategists said. ""We identify an upside growth/inflation driven rate shock originating in the U.S., a supply-driven upward oil price shock, and a downward growth shock from China as the most visible among them.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/27/fed-likely-to-be-most-dovish-central-bank-in-2024-research-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c7cc940bb8d37d1d28af672e7a55271883cfde9-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The sales took the November total of shares dropped by the Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) to 579,077, earning it about $16.9 million based on the relevant day's closing share price.  ARK Invest often loads up on crypto-related shares when they have experienced a downward trend and sells them as they look more bullish to bank some profits.  The discount shrank to 8.6% on Friday, the lowest since July 2021, in a sign of escalating optimism that a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will finally be approved in the U.S. Analysts attributed the improvement to Grayscale's meeting with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about turning the trust into a spot ETF.

20762514,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562584,1701077422,Road To $1: Why Did Terra Classic (USTC) Rise 300% In One Day?,"TerraClassicUSD (USTC), the algorithmic stablecoin tied to the LUNA ecosystem, recently went on an upward trajectory to register gains of over 300%. In a stunning cascade of events, the token’s price spike in the past 24 hours has left investors wondering about the implication for Terra Classic (LUNC) and the potential revival of the LUNA ecosystem. USTC Coin Spikes 300% In One Day USTC has lost most of its usefulness as a stablecoin since its implosion in 2022 when it was known as UST. The stablecoin lost its peg to the US dollar which resulted in a chain of events that led to its sister token, LUNA, also losing most of its value and the demise of the Terra-LUNA blockchain ecosystem. After it lost its peg to the US dollar, the stablecoin was rebranded as UST Classic and its value fell to as low as $0.01. Related Reading: XRP Price May Recapture 61,000% Surge Seen In 2017, Analyst Claims It’s already been more than a year since the crash, but it looks like the token and some members of the LUNA ecosystem are not ready to give up yet. The latest price action has seen the token spike 300% from $0.01569 to $0.0755 in the past 24 hours. The catalyst for this surge can be attributed to Terra Classic Labs (TCL), a LUNC community project. Terra Classic Labs was created in October 2023 by some members of the former thriving LUNA ecosystem. According to its website, it is dedicated to supporting new LUNC projects for the revival of the Terra ecosystem. In a social media post by Trader QT, an official partner of Luna Classic Labs, the team made a massive purchase of approximately 25.6 million USTC for $500,000 at an average price of $0.021 per $USTC. This move sent USTC spiking, fueling hopes that Terra Classic Labs can help revive and stabilize the cryptocurrency. I can confirm that today, in an initial strategic investment, Luna Classic Labs has purchased approximately 25.6m $USTC for $500k in accordance with its Treasury Reserve Policy, at an average price of approximately $0.021 per $USTC. — Trader QT (@0x_Ears) November 26, 2023 Can Terra Classic Return To $1? Although the move by Terra Classic Labs sent USTC on a surge, the stablecoin is still trading at $0.0516, far from a $1 price point. The crypto will have to register another gain of 1837% from its current price before it can regain its peg to the US dollar, showing how far behind it is. The recent price action however did have some sort of bullish action on Terra Classic LUNC, as it has also spiked by 25% in the past 24 hours. Terra Classic is trading at $0.0001004 at the time of writing. Related Reading: Whales Move $30 Million Worth Of XRP To Exchanges – Time To Sell? Although the Terra Classic community hasn’t given up on the cryptocurrency, the LUNA ecosystem has since rebranded and moved from Terra Classic LUNC to a new chain (Terra 2.0) with its own native token called LUNA. It would seem LUNA also reacted positively to the TerraClassicUSD surge as data from Coinmarketcap shows LUNA has increased by 17.8% in the past 24 hours and is now trading at $0.79.

This initiative marks a substantial advancement in the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. Named after the influential Italian mathematician Girolamo Cardano, the chatbot intends to symbolize the fusion of historical intellectual legacy with contemporary technological innovation. Girolamo is engineered to provide a range of functionalities, including content generation, image generation, and image interpretation, which are tailored to accommodate diverse user inquiries. This suite of capabilities enables the chatbot to offer real-time, contextually aware responses, extending its utility beyond standard blockchain applications. The inclusion of image-related functionalities represents a significant technological stride, enhancing the interactive experience and broadening the scope of its applicability. To participate in the beta testing phase of Girolamo, users are required to hold a minimum of 5000 CGI tokens, as outlined by CardanoGPT. Access to the chatbot is facilitated through the CardanoGPT Discord server, where users undergo a wallet verification process. Upon successful verification, users are granted the @cyborg role, enabling them to interact directly with Girolamo in the designated chat channel. Related Reading: Cardano Phoenix Moment: Price Breakout In The Face Of Recent Setbacks CardanoGPT’s announcement emphasizes that Girolamo is still in its beta phase, suggesting ongoing development and potential enhancements. This phase is critical for assessing the chatbot’s performance, user experience, and overall functionality within the Cardano ecosystem. The company has highlighted its commitment to continuous innovation and development, aiming to maintain a leading position in the convergence of AI and blockchain technology. Cardano Price Poised For 22% Surge? ADA has seen a strong upward trend since breaking out of the downward trend (black line) on October 21, which has caused the price to rise by over 60%. For the past two weeks, however, the rally has come to a standstill. The price is in a consolidation after the ADA was rejected at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.411. Related Reading: Cardano Forecast: Crypto Analyst Identifies The Event That Could Send ADA Price To $11 However, the AI narrative and potential hype in this market segment could be significantly bullish for the Cardano price once the launch of Girolamo is on the horizon. AI tokens have seen some sharp price movements over the past few months, driven by news around the progress of OpenAI and other companies. In the short term, the ADA price may need a retest of support at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.37 to herald the next upward move. Remarkably, the price level is of double importance as the 20-day exponential moving average is also at this price level. If this price level is defended in the next few days, it could be the precursor to the next move higher. The obvious target would be the yearly high at $0.463. Reaching this price would mean a 22% rally from the current price.

42409361,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGr2Y,1701072000,Ripple Excites XRP Army as Metaco Acquisition Brings Banks Closer,"News that Metaco, the Swiss digital assets custody firm acquired by Ripple earlier this year, is working with HSBC, one of the world's largest banks, quickly became a reason to be cheerful for many supporters of the U.S. fintech’s ledger protocol, known collectively as the “XRP army.”  Named after the cryptocurrency designed to move liquidity around the XRP Ledger used by Ripple, these avid fans interpret HSBC’s choice of custody tech partner as yet another sign that financial institutions will inevitably adopt XRPL and, crucially, the XRP token.  The crypto space is ferociously tribal. Token holders want to believe their blockchain of choice will rise to prominence and deliver a windfall – sometimes to a point that defies logic. For instance, the assumption that Ripple’s recent acquisition spurred HSBC’s decision ignores the fact that Metaco had been courting the bank for over 18 months, according to Adrien Treccani, the Swiss custody firm’s CEO.  There is, however, an indirect correlation between Ripple protocols and Metaco’s banking clients, Treccani says.  “There is an indirect link, which is that the adoption of Ripple and Metaco's solutions further promotes the adoption of the XRPL as a protocol,” Treccani said in an interview. “Every success of Ripple the company is also a success for the XRP Ledger.”  Ripple, for its part, has worked hard at courting banks, with a focus on ways to reduce the friction in areas like cross-border payments. As such, XRPL remains one of the longest-running examples of a private tokenization blockchain, said Treccani.  “XRPL is designed for both public and private use and scales substantially better than competitors on the market like the EVM chains,” he said, referring to the Ethereum Virtual Machine. “It natively supports tokenized assets rather than going through smart contracts, and also allows for on-chain trading with other blockchain-based exchanges or AMMs.” AMMs are automated market makers.  Combining Metaco and Ripple, therefore, offers a complete vertical stack, Treccani said, comprising an infrastructure layer and a services layer.  “We can provide a bank with the infrastructure, and also tokenization life cycle, payments primitives, and liquidity management all from a single vendor – with the proper segregation between that infrastructure and those value-added services,” he said.  This is all well and good, but rumors and reports began to emanate following the acquisition of Metaco that some of its banking customers were nervous and thinking about taking their business elsewhere. The reason perhaps concerns Ripple’s dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Treccani said some of the speculation was “frankly a little bit crazy,” adding that post-acquisition discussions and reassessments by clients are par for the course, and that many of the contracts signed with the banks are subject to change-of-control clauses.  “Yes, there have been such discussions and we have spent recent months clarifying the situation with the banks,” Treccani said. “I think we have been successful. Going forward, you are going to see more tier one bank partnerships that we will soon be announcing in Europe, the U.S., APAC and Africa.”  Like many big banks, HSBC is joining the trend towards tokenization, the process of handling the ownership and transfer of real-world assets on blockchains, which requires some solid digital asset custody tech.  But Treccani makes clear that cryptocurrency and its libertarian mindset is what drives him. He said he believes many banks will want to offer cryptocurrency-related services eventually, and if they build for tokenization now, these institutions will have everything they need for cryptocurrency entry when the time comes.  “If it was just for tokenization, I would not be in this game,” he said.",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | WALLET | XRP,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/27/ripple-edges-closer-to-banks-via-crypto-custody-firm-metaco,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/058267b7b8ee3a27e94682e195769f0040a8c004-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409369,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGrJ5,1701069154,Cosmos Founder Calls for Chain Split; ATOM Down 3%,"Cosmos' founder Jae Kwon favours splitting the blockchain into two following a decision by the community to reduce Cosmos' native token ATOM's inflation to 10%.  The hard fork, dubbed AtomOne, could be bullish for ATOM token, according to one observer.  ATOM, the native coin of Cosmos Hub, a blockchain acting as an intermediary among all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network, is nursing moderate losses a day after Comos' founder Jae Kwon called community members to split the blockchain into two, with one observer hailing the potential hard fork as a bullish outcome for the investor community.  ""Let's coordinate a split,"" Kwon said Sunday, following a decision by the Cosmos community to approve a proposal to reduce ATOM's inflation to 10% from 14%. Cosmos Hub is an intermediary among all independent blockchains created within the Cosmos network.  The so-called proposal 848, approved with 41.1% support for the reduction from the participating voting power and 31.9% against it, said that ATOM's double-digit inflation rate represented overpayment by the Hub for security and disincentivized ATOM's use in decentralized finance. The approved change is projected to bring down Atom's annualized staking yield from approximately 19% to about 13.4%. Staking refers to locking coins in a blockchain in return for rewards.  Kwon, however, wasn't impressed and called for the hard fork.  ""Despite our voting [against the plan]… 848 has ended up passing, something that isn't too surprising (though it would be good to know whether the later votes came from newly purchased ATOMs),"" Kwon said on X.  Kwon referred to the hard fork as AtomOne, which would fork the Cosmos Hub, calling for a final plan whereby the forked chain would support ATOM token along with the native ATOM1.  ""I believe that the final plan should include an integration of $ATOM and $ATMO/$ATOM1 so that instead of mass selling $ATOM and collapsing it all, we allow participation from $ATOM, but what is in the README can be improved. Tokenomics people take a shot,"" Kwon said on X.  According to X user ""John Galt,"" an expert on Cosmos and head of strategy at Stride Zone, a potential hard fork could resolve years of community infighting and bode well for ATOM token holders.  ""A fork would be very bullish. For years, political tension has impeded the development of Cosmos Hub. Most notably when the ATOM 2.0 proposal was vetoed in the fall of 2022,"" Galt said on X. ""Without Jae's conservatism, Cosmos Hub could be more innovative.""  Besides, Galt expects the hard fork to lead to the biggest airdrop for ATOM and could result in a massive increase in trading volume for both ATOM and ATOM1 tokens.  Airdrops involve blockchain-based projects and developers sending free tokens to the communities as part of a broader marketing initiative. When a chain splits, the native coin of the new blockchain is usually airdropped to token holders from the original blockchain.  ""Jae is calling the new chain AtomOne (ATOM1). Most of the ATOM1 allocation would go to ATOM stakers pro-rata their amount. Unclear if liquid ATOM is included,"" Galt said.  Still, as of writing, ATOM traded 3.5% lower on the day at $9.59, according to CoinDesk data. The cryptocurrency peeped above $10 over the weekend but failed to establish a foothold above the three-week-long resistance. The weakness perhaps stems from bitcoin, the industry leaders, struggling to get past the $38,000 mark.  15:37 UTC: Mentions Cosmos Hub's role in the Cosmos network in the first para.",NEUTRAL,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | AIRDROP | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/27/cosmos-founder-calls-for-chain-split-atom-down-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc883b0ed03e1d6d2469ea09c57e63c59afbdcc6-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Late last week, CZ's counsel argued that the very fact he – a non-U.S. citizen holding UAE and Canadian passports – voluntarily entered the U.S. to appear before a court represents that he's not a flight risk.  ""Based on all the relevant facts, including Mr. Zhao's voluntary self-surrender, his intent to resolve this case, and the sizable bail package he proposed, Judge Tsuchida found that Mr. Zhao presents no risk of flight, even while residing in the UAE,"" last week's filing said.  But U.S. Attorneys pushed back on that, arguing that the potential severity of the sentence would give Zhao incentive to flee back to the UAE, which has no extradition treaty with the U.S. Last week, prosecutors said Zhao, as a citizen of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), had ""minimal ties to the U.S."" and may not return should he be allowed to leave.  ""The reality is that the top-end of the Guidelines range may be as high as 18 months, and the United States is free to argue for any sentence up to the statutory maximum of ten years,"" the filing reads. ""The penalties he faces at sentencing will no doubt seem significant to him, and that weighs in favor of the reasonable restrictions the United States proposes.""
