42384439,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXQjv,1597518000,What Venezuelans Think About Bitcoin and American Media,"In this audio interview, CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen and Venezuelan journalist Javier Bastardo talk about cryptocurrency and the media industry.      For more episodes and free early access before our regular 3 p.m. Eastern time releases, subscribe with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, iHeartRadio or RSS.      This episode is sponsored by Crypto.com, Bitstamp and Nexo.io.      Caracas-based bitcoiner and journalist Javier Bastardo has covered the crypto scene in Latin America since 2017. In that time he's been living partially off bitcoin, thanks to BTCPay server and a variety of employers that pay in crypto, like CoinTelegraph Espanol.      “Even when I’m trying to report in an unbiased way, I’m really bullish on crypto,” Bastardo said. “Bitcoin could be useful to other Venezuelans.”      Beyond holding it as savings, many Venezuelans use cryptocurrency as the fastest way to obtain dollars. Bastardo said there is more in common between crypto readers across the Americas, both Latin America and North America, than similarities within local geographies.      “We’re talking to a very specific audience, even if I’m writing in Spanish and you’re writing in English,” Bastardo said, referring to CoinDesk writers in New York and California. “We are more connected than I would be with a person who writes about politics in Venezuela ... The way they [crypto audiences] look for information is very particular to the types of viewers that we have.”      See also: India May Be Starting Its Biggest Bitcoin Bull Run Yet      When it comes to the media, in Venezuela it is more clear to readers that journalists can be activists and that corporate media is often government propaganda. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least five journalists were murdered for doing their jobs in Venezuela over the past few decades. In this context, censorship isn’t merely about ad policies or social pressure. It comes from the government and is applied directly to the communications infrastructure.    Outrageous narratives about Venezuelans    Despite the struggle to identify reliable narratives, many readers make financial decisions based on media reports and social media trends. Media production and financial markets have always been intertwined, for better or worse. This is especially true of cryptocurrency markets.      “They [crypto readers] are already against journalism, against the information industry. They have more anger about the information,” Bastardo said, describing the challenge of making media for this niche audience. “They need the narrative to keep going about adoption, about mainstream, yea, bitcoin will save us. It’s weird, because we have an active scene but it’s little.”      While the outrage associated with crypto coverage may be unique, the dynamic of media-driven markets is hardly new. After all, the financial outlet Bloomberg reportedly gave bonuses to reporters for “market-moving” stories and many American outlets offer bonuses for web traffic, which may incentivize sensationalism. These policy decisions come from the top, as with most business models, and rarely originates from the newsroom itself.      See also: The Mounting Evidence of a New Bitcoin Bull Market      From his perspective, Bastardo said it’s unclear whether North American media, including but not limited to crypto journalism, is deliberately biased.      “I really don’t know if the things we see on CNN or CNBC are identified with some party,” he said. “We have those narratives that show [U.S. President] Trump is a really good [president] and others that show him as a really bad president. This is a problem in the whole media industry.”      In particular, he said some crypto content creators might be “aligned” and “trying to push some agendas,” but that it’s unclear what is really going on with the overlap between journalism and cryptocurrency marketing. For example, he said people overhype and sensationalize stories of bitcoin usage in Venezuela, which can be both dehumanizing and misleading. It becomes even harder for readers to decipher because some of the most trusted sources in the crypto industry are individuals without journalistic training or oversight. This creates even more opportunities for freelancers with bold personalities, but a more challenging environment for readers seeking relatively objective information.      “We have a similar way to get information in Venezuela, but it’s worse because we don’t really have open media,” he said. “But the crypto-related media, I don’t know if the writers are biased ... I don’t know if this is true. This is only an opinion.”      For more episodes and free early access before our regular 3 p.m. Eastern time releases, subscribe with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, iHeartRadio or RSS.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/15/what-venezuelans-think-about-bitcoin-and-american-media,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a61b10bc3566264c349c0c1be05b5f1544f0d51-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384442,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXQsj,1597516451,Ether's Rally to 25-Month High on DeFi Boom Drives Record Demand for Derivatives,"Investor interest in the ether (ETH) futures and options market hit a new peak on Friday as the cryptocurrency’s price rose to 25-month highs.    Open interest in futures or total value of outstanding contracts rose to a record high of $1.73 billion on Friday, according to data source Skew.  The previous record high of $1.45 billion was reached on Aug. 5.  The value of open positions in the options market also reached a record high of $454 million.  ETH’s price jumped to a two-year high of $445 on Friday and is trading near $435 at press time, according to CoinDesk’s ether price index.  Futures open interest has increased by nearly 300% this year.  On July 22, ETH’s price broke out of a two-month price range of $210 to $250.  Since then, ETH has rallied by 65% and the number of open positions in the futures market and options market has increased by 50% and 53%, respectively.  Increasing open interest is viewed as indicating money flowing into the marketplace.  That rise in open interest combined with a price rally is usually taken to indicate there is solid support for the upward trend.  ETH has established a foothold above the June 2019 high of $365, while bitcoin has yet to clear the high of $13,880 seen 13 months ago.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, ETH has gained nearly 240% this year, powered by the exploding popularity in decentralized finance (DeFi), which runs on the Ethereum blockchain.  “The DeFi boom looks to be powering gains in ether,” said John Ng Pangilinan, managing partner at Singapore-based Signum Capital.  Right now, the options market is currently skewed bullish on ETH with calls (bullish bets) claiming higher prices than puts (bearish bets) on the one, three, and six-month time frames. In short, most of those placing bets on the future direction of ether think the cryptocurrency still has room to rise.  In another sign of this belief, the futures market is in contango – a condition where futures price trades higher than the spot price.  Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based digital asset firm Bequant, noted that the continued rise in ETH’s price is notable considering how the costs of executing transactions on Ethereum’s blockchain have recently gone nuclear.

About 900 bitcoins are mined per day, given the current issuance rate of 6.25 bitcoins minted per block and the target 10-minute block time.  At last check, nearly 31,000 bitcoins have been tokenized on Ethereum, according to Dune Analytics, 75% of which were minted by wrapped bitcoin (WBTC).  Ethereum’s supply of tokenized bitcoins hovered below 3,000 until mid-May, when the rate of new tokens shot up.  The rate of bitcoin tokenization signals the surging demand to use bitcoin in the burgeoning network of Ethereum-based DeFi applications.  “WBTC continues to exhibit strong growth as demand for bitcoin in DeFi has exploded,” said Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, in a private message with CoinDesk. “I expect this trend to continue,” he added.  In July, Three Arrows Capital minted its tokenized bitcoins through BitGo, the company that helped spearhead wrapped bitcoin in 2019.  Within a year, WBTC will be a “first class asset” in the decentralized finance ecosystem, predicted Three Arrows co-founder Su Zhu, “just as USDC and USDT are now.”",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT | USDC,BTC | ETH | USDT | USDC,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/15/bitcoins-are-being-tokenized-faster-than-theyre-mined-as-defi-craze-continues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19c911468f593d117ae192904d396d52351ac21f-862x582.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384444,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXQqD,1597492800,"Enterprises Would Use DeFi, if It Weren't so Public","Paul Brody is a Principal and Global Blockchain Leader at EY.      Decentralized finance (DeFi) services are booming, but there’s indication it’s recycling the same money around and around. To grow this market, enterprises need to get involved – and that won’t happen until users have privacy and security.      In the old-school world of CeFi (centralized finance) it’s common to dismiss DeFi because it is designed to support anonymous transactions that can enable money laundering. This is, of course, completely wrong, but it makes for a good scare story against the competition. In reality, it’s DeFi’s lack of privacy that may become an ever-growing constraint on this industry.      See also: DeFi Dad – Five Years In, DeFi Now Defines Ethereum      For businesses, jumping in to DeFi could generate enormous value. Unlike simpler transactions like savings and deposits, financing assets can be complex. Getting a good valuation depends on sharing documents, data on asset quality, or past cash-flow history. In the real world, that’s time-consuming and paper-intensive, leading to a higher chance of fraud risk and fewer choices. On a blockchain, reliable data can be distributed to a range of bidders instantly.      While yield-farming and other DeFi tools are capturing attention today, it remains a closed loop of apps. In the traditional financial system, financing extends to major capital assets like cars, homes and industrial equipment. Enterprises might be interested in seamless ways to move capital, but they also need to guard their trade secrets. On a public blockchain, those secrets would be fully exposed.    We are enjoying an explosion of innovation and growth in the DeFi space. For that to continue, the market has to become both broader and deeper.    Although blockchains like Ethereum do not attach names to addresses, it is possible to trace transactions to individuals. This is especially the case for large enterprises or larger private portfolios that frequently move large sums of money. It would be easy to apply analytics to estimate who is playing in the market and what strategies are being pursued. For most large companies and investors, this is a deal killer.      Privacy should not be confused with anonymity. The goal is not to hide transactions from regulators, but to hide transactions from casual inspection by potential competitors. For individuals buying digital assets, this can be done by purchasing crypto through exchanges that mix transactions. This process doesn’t work for digitized contracts. If enterprises sign and take ownership of smart contracts, which tokenize and automate business deals, they reveal the parties and requirements of those contracts.      This is where approaches like the Baseline Protocol can be applied. The goal of the Baseline Protocol is not merely to connect large companies securely and privately across the public blockchains, it is also to preserve the power and value of tokenization. Inputs and outputs like purchase orders, invoices and capital asset leases are designed to be tokenized under privacy, and then can be transferred, used and managed in the same kinds of DeFi solutions as the ones being developed today.      While privacy tools can help shield companies from having their own strategies made public, they don’t have to prevent the market from operating with transparency. Well-designed mathematical proofs and smart contracts can shield buyer and seller identities while exposing pertinent information.      See also: Stephanie Hurder – Why Enterprise Blockchains Fail: No Economic Incentives      This could be great if businesses need to send market signals but don’t want to disclose who is involved in a deal, replicating the transparency in stock markets today, where total volumes and prices are known, but not buyers and sellers.      We are enjoying an explosion of innovation and growth in the DeFi space. For that to continue, the market has to become both broader and deeper. That means enterprises and real-world assets joining this game at scale. This isn’t easy, because building for privacy is more complex and challenging than openness.      While building private financial tools is complex, there are precedents, one of which enabled takeoff in the most-important market today. The web didn’t gain meaningful traction in commerce until secure socket layers (SSL) made commerce secure. SSL made websites far more complex, between security certificates and encryption, but it also enticed consumers by the millions. The same is needed for DeFi.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/15/enterprises-would-use-defi-if-it-werent-so-public,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a9ad5c96f9e75e8bb0e4b723fa588a2a568c659-2400x1593.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Backed by investors including PayPal co-founder Peter Theil and the Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company, Layer1 currently operates bitcoin mining facilities in West Texas.    According to Lancium’s filed complaint, Layer1’s “demand-response” model that allows the firm to shut down mining operations and redirect power to the grid during high demand violates the firm’s patent.   Granted in March of this year, Lancium holds a patent on technology to help adjust power consumption at “flexible” data centers that kick into action when there is low demand for power, hence making it cheaper, and shut down when there is a spike.   According to exhibits attached with Lancium’s filed complaint, the firm tried to alert Layer1 of this possible infringement in May 2020 but received no response from the mining firm.   In its filed complaint, Lancium argues it should receive damages commensurate with willful infringement of the firm’s patent and a permanent injunction should be granted to prevent any further violation by Layer1 or any of its employees.
