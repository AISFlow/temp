42381779,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pWsP,1556228725,"Bitfinex Covered $850 Million Loss Using Tether Funds, NY Prosecutors Allege","UPDATE 2:50 UTC April 26: This story has been updated to include a statement from Bitfinex at the end.      The New York Attorney General's office has alleged that crypto exchange Bitfinex lost $850 million and subsequently used funds from affiliated stablecoin operator Tether to secretly cover the shortfall.  According to a press release issued Thursday, NYAG Letitia James announced that she had obtained a court order against iFinex Inc., which operates both Bitfinex and Tether, ordering them to cease violating New York law and defrauding New York residents.  James said that an investigation by her department determined that iFinex “engaged in a cover-up to hide the apparent loss of $850 million of co-mingled client and corporate funds,” adding:  “New York state has led the way in requiring virtual currency businesses to operate according to the law. And we will continue to stand-up for investors and seek justice on their behalf when misled or cheated by any of these companies.”  According to the statement, Bitfinex sent $850 million of customer and corporate funds to Crypto Capital Corp., a payment processor that is said to be holding funds from other exchanges as well, such as QuadrigaCX. Funds from Tether’s reserve were used to make up the shortfall, but neither the loss nor Tether’s fund movements were disclosed to customers.  So far, more than $600 million is alleged to have been transferred.  According to a filing attributed to assistant Attorney General Brian Whitehurst, the probe began sometime in 2018 and appeared to have been driven because, despite claims to the contrary, ""OAG has reason to believe that Bitfinex still allows New York-based individual investors to deposit, trade, and withdraw virtual currencies, and engage in other transactions, on the Bitfinex trading platform.""  Under the court order, iFinex directors, officers, principals, agents, employees, contractors, assignees or any other affiliated individuals are to cease accessing, loaning or making any other claim to the dollar reserves held by Tether.  Similarly, iFinex-affiliated individuals are ordered to not tamper with any documentation, including records, which outline these actions.  Notably, the filing said the AG's office is not seeking to prevent legitimate trading on Bitfinex or redemptions by Tether; on the contrary, the office wants the court to grant a preliminary injunction to ""preserve the status quo"" pending completion of the investigation.  The action comes months after the AG's office published the results of its crypto exchange inquiry, focusing on a group that included Bitfinex.  The focus on Tether reserves is a notable one, given the long scrutiny directed toward the firm and its USDT stablecoin. Critics alleged that the token, with its more than $2 billion market cap, was not actually backed by sufficient funds as claimed by its operators. The failure to obtain a proper audit as previously pledged further inflamed those suspicions, and in March, Tether revealed that the reserves backing USDT may not be entirely composed of fiat currency.  AG document outlines months of turbulence  According to an affirmation attributed to assistant New York Attorney General Brian Whitehurst, discussions between the AG’s office and representatives for Bitfinex and Tether date back to November. The document states that law firms Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP of New York and Steptoe & Johnson LLP of Washington, D.C. jointly represented the two companies.  The affirmation details Bitfinex’s growing banking issues and its efforts to maintain services in some form, including a now-ended relationship with a Puerto Rico-based company called Noble Bank that ended in October 2018. Bitfinex and Tether’s ended their relationship with Noble because of its inability to process a high volume of wire transfers as well as low interest rates, the companies’ lawyers told the attorney general’s office.  Tether later struck up a banking relationship with Deltec in the Bahamas, as CoinDesk reported in November.  According to the AG’s office, the inability to access the $850 million in customer/corporate funds – which was blamed on payment processor Crypto Capital, according to the documents – impaired Bitfinex’s ability to process withdrawal requests. CoinDesk previously detailed these problems, with some customers complaining of long response times and delayed receipt of their money.  “Documents provided to OAG demonstrate that by mid-2018. Bifinex was having extreme difficulty honoring its clients' requests to withdraw their money from the trading platform because Crypto Capital, which held all or almost all of Bitfinex·s funds, refused to process customer withdrawal requests and refused or was unable to return any funds to Bitfinex,” the affirmation states.  In mid-October 2018, Bitfinex released a statement declaring that withdrawal were moving “without the slightest interference” but that “processing complications” had led to the suspension of fiat deposits. This was in spite of the fact that some customers were still complaining about slow withdrawals.  According to the AG’s office, that statement wasn’t true. “Documents provided to OAG by Respondents show that during this time, Bitfinex was having severe problems processing client withdrawals,” the affirmation stated.  Crypto Capital  Representatives for Bitfinex and Tether told the AG’s office that a Bitfinex official was told the reason the $851 million couldn’t be access was because Portuguese, Polish and American government officials had “seized” the funds.  But Bitfinex, according to the document, didn’t believe this explanation.  “Based on statements made by counsel for Respondents to AG attorneys... Respondents do not believe Crypto Capital's representations that the funds have been seized,” the affirmation states.  As noted in the AG’s press release, the inability to access these funds was kept from customers, and today’s news represents the first time the loss was disclosed publicly.  It was during this situation that Bitfinex and Tether began to discuss a way for Bitfinex to tap funds held in reserve to back the USDT token.  “In an in-person meeting on February 21, 2019. counsel for Bittinex and Tether explained that, in order to make up for the apparent loss of $851 million to Crypto Capital, Bitfinex and Tether were in the process of contemplating a transaction that would permit Bitfinex to draw upon Tether's cash reserves on an as-needed basis,” the document states, going on to explain:  “As described by counsel. Bitfinex would take a 'line of credit' of $600 to $700 million on the reserve funds backing tethers. Counsel did not suggest what if any. benefit would accrue to Tether or holders of tethers, from this transaction. Nor did counsel suggest that this transaction would be disclosed to the public. including investors trading on the Bitfinex platform or holders of tether.”  According to Whitehurst, when questioned about a possible conflict of interest given the close ties between the companies (the two firms share managers and owners), “counsel characterized the impending transaction as arms length without providing justification for how that could be the case.”  These disclosures were a cause for concern within the AG’s office, according to the document.  “Counsel's disclosures at the February 21 meeting raised serious questions about the viability of Bitfinex as an ongoing concern, the possibility that Tether's cash reserves would be dissipated and unrecoverable, and whether Bitfinex and Tether have misled their clients (including both clients of the Bitfinex trading platform. and holders of tethers) regarding the matters described above,” Whitehurst said.  The coming weeks would see the AG’s office continue to seek information from Bitfinex and Tether, including data on tether issuances and documents supporting their claims regarding the $850 million loss.  “On March 4, 2019 counsel for Bitfinex and Tether responded to OAG’s letter with an email stating, ‘it is not possible to get this information by March 1.’ Counsel did not provide an alternative production date to OAG,” the affirmation states.  On March 29, after further discussions, the representatives disclosed in a letter to the AG that the credit line had been closed and “during November 2018, Tether transferred $625 million held in its account at Deltec to Bitfinex’s account at Deltec. , in turn, caused a total [of] $625 million to be transferred from Bitfinex's account at Crypto Capital to Tether·s account at Crypto Capital, through a ledger entry at Crypto Capital crediting Tether·s account in the amount of $625 million and debiting Bitfinex ·s account by a corresponding amount. The purpose of this exchange was to allow Bitfinex to address liquidity issues unrelated to tethers.”  Subsequently, an arrangement was struck to create a $900 million line of credit, with a three-year term and an interest rate of 6.5 percent.  “Under this transaction, the line of credit is secured by a share charge over 60,000,000 iFinex Inc. shares owned by DigFinex. which DigFinex agreed not to otherwise encumber. That transaction closed on or about March 19.20 19. The total assessed under the loan facility as of today's date is equal to $700 million,” the representatives’ letter states, going on to conclude:  ”On March 27, 2019, Bitfinex and Tether initiated a transaction debiting $625 million previously credited to Tether's account at Crypto Capital. and transferring those funds to Bitfinex·s account at Crypto Capital. This transaction was made because the prior exchange or assets was converted into a line of credit secured by the DigFinex shares.”  According to the affirmation, this credit line -- in addition to the inability to access the $850 million -- was not disclosed to investors.  “Respondents have only produced limited relevant information regarding the facts and circumstances of the $625 million transfer and the subsequent ‘line of credit’ transaction,” it states.  Bitfinex Responds  Late Thursday, Bitfinex issued the following statement:    Earlier today, the New York Attorney General’s office released an order it obtained – without notice or a hearing – in an attempt to compel Bitfinex and Tether to provide certain documents and seeking certain injunctive relief.      The New York Attorney General’s court filings were written in bad faith and are riddled with false assertions, including as to a purported $850 million “loss” at Crypto Capital. On the contrary, we have been informed that these Crypto Capital amounts are not lost but have been, in fact, seized and safeguarded. We are and have been actively working to exercise our rights and remedies and get those funds released. Sadly, the New York Attorney General’s office seems to be intent on undermining those efforts to the detriment of our customers.    Bitfinex and Tether have been fully cooperative with the New York Attorney General’s office, as both companies are with all regulators. The New York Attorney General’s office should focus its efforts on trying to aid and support our recovery efforts.    Both Bitfinex and Tether are financially strong – full stop. And both Bitfinex and Tether are committed to fighting this gross overreach by the New York Attorney General’s office against companies that are good corporate citizens and strong supporters of law enforcement. Bitfinex and Tether will vigorously challenge this, and any and all other actions, by the New York Attorney General’s office.

42381770,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pWh5,1556216245,MakerDAO Set to Increase DAI Fees Above 15% in Bid to Stabilize Stablecoin,"UPDATE: MakerDAO token holders have now voted to increase the DAI Stability Fee to 16.5 percent.    ________    A majority vote to increase fees on programmatic lending platform MakerDAO has passed an initial round of polling today.  This time, the winning vote is to increase fees by 2 percent, which, in comparison to past weeks, is a comparatively small increase to the usual 3 or 4 percent. As is custom, the 2 percent increase will undergo a secondary round of polling starting tomorrow and be executed once a certain threshold of voter participation is met.  These fees – also called the ""Stability Fee"" – are applied to all loans taken out through the MakerDAO system for dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI. At present, the rate at which fees accrue on the total amount of DAI loaned is 14.5 percent.  Once ratified in a secondary round of polling called ""the executive vote,"" fees will begin to accrue on MakerDAO loans at 16.5 percent.  Taking a step back, MakerDAO is the preeminent issuer of DAI which currently has a circulating supply of over 80 million tokens. In order for users to mint new DAI tokens, they must lock-up holdings of ether on the ethereum network in smart contracts called ""Collateralized Debt Positions.""  To date, almost 2 percent of all ether – amounting to roughly $330 million – has been locked up in CDPs.  For months now, MakerDAO token holders have been upping the fees to CDP loans in efforts to reduce DAI supply and restore a weakened peg back to dollar valuation. However, as stated by Vishesh Choudhry of the MakerDAO Foundation's Risk Team, reductions to DAI supply as a result of higher fees do not seem to be impacting the trading price of DAI.  ""With the last [fee] increase, the price has held relatively stable but still below the peg,"" said Choudhry during today's weekly call on MakerDAO governance and risk. ""We've seen an impact of the stability fee [on supply] but it's not bringing up in any sustained, meaningful way the price above the $0.97 level.""  'Stability fee purists'  Choudhry noted that due to recent fee hikes, the overall supply of DAI has dropped from 95 million to now 88 million.  ""It seems the increasing costs of drawing out DAI has been an actual effective deterrent to contracting the [DAI] supply but contracting the supply has not saved the price peg,"" emphasized Choudhry on the call.  To this, Cyrus Younessi, the Risk Team lead at the MakerDAO Foundation, maintained that he didn't see ""anything structurally deficient"" with the present course of action being taken if ""higher stability fees lowers the supply"" and MakerDAO token holders are ""comfortable with high variant stability fees"" moving forward.  The emphasis to strictly continue raising fees was met with some amount of disagreement from other community members, such as former legal advisor to the MakerDAO Foundation Chris Padovano, on today's call.  ""Why all of a sudden are we just stability fee purists?"" questioned Padovano. ""We're pretty certain we have too much supply. I think everyone is in agreement with that...If we we have too much supply, why don't we cap supply?  Referencing the overall debt supply ceiling which restricts the amount of ether that can be locked up for DAI, Padovano argued that perhaps additional efforts to reduce this supply ceiling should be taken in order to restore DAI dollar valuation.  To this proposal, Richard Brown, the MakerDAO Foundation's head of community development, responded by saying that ""a thesis"" needed to be presented about what the MakerDAO debt ceiling is and why it should be used as a tool for restoring supply and demand imbalances.  ""There's a significant amount of due diligence that needs to be performed before changes to the system can be considered,"" said Brown. ""There needs to be clear plan of action...or it won't go anywhere.""

42381781,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pWuv,1556214311,Tobacco Giant Philip Morris Is Building a Different Kind of 'Public' Blockchain,"Tobacco giant Philip Morris International is working on a ""public blockchain,"" an executive said, though not quite in the commonly understood sense of the term.  ""We want to do public blockchains,"" Nitin Manoharan, Philip Morris' global head of architecture and tech innovation, said onstage Thursday at the London Blockchain Expo.  Specifically, the New York-based multi-national company would use this technology to track tax stamps on cigarette boxes, Manoharan said. While that may sound prosaic, he said these bits of paper are valuable (worth about $5.50 per packet), manually dealt with and easily counterfeited (generally fraudsters use a high-resolution photocopier), costing the industry and governments $100 million a year.  Manoharan estimated that Philip Morris alone could save $20 million off the bat by automating processes and reducing fraud with the traceability and transparency afforded by a blockchain.  And while most enterprise blockchains are permissioned, meaning only approved parties are allowed to participate, the one Philip Morris envisions in this instance would be widely accessible. After his panel discussion, Manoharan told CoinDesk:  ""The aspiration is an industry-wide blockchain that interested stakeholders can come in and subscribe to it and benefit from it. If they see no value they can just leave.""  When asked specifically if that meant anyone could run a node without permission, he said yes, acknowledging they would need an incentive to do so.  ""We want to make sure that the minimum viable ecosystem we put in place is attractive to all the stakeholders who participate in this particular ecosystem,"" he said. ""So there needs to be a value proposition, there needs to be a reason for taking part. Because if there’s not sufficient value on the table they will not engage. So the only way to make it sustainable is to ensure stakeholders benefit from this blockchain.""  However, this does not necessarily mean Philip Morris is creating a cryptocurrency or building on top of the public ethereum blockchain. Rather, according to Manoharan, it is tailoring ethereum and MultiChain, Coin Sciences' build-your-own-blockchain platform for enterprises, to create this new open-access network. Philip Morris is also talking to the Hyperledger consortium, he added.  Public-private potpourri  Tax stamp tracking is one of six blockchain use cases that Philip Morris is exploring and looking to go live with next year, according to Manoharan.  ""We view it use case by use case,"" he said. ""But this particular use case, for me it's a public blockchain use case. I wouldn't say public for all of them: there are quite a few use cases that are purely internal and need to go through access control etc.""  Nevertheless, he said open networks hold the greatest promise, concluding:  ""Permissioned blockchains are fairly simple. The opportunity is small and you can achieve everything that permissioned blockchain does with existing infrastructure and existing tools. The real value is with public blockchains where you can have multiple players coming in and participating in a trustless manner.""

42381776,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pWpt,1556201611,Leaked Letter Exposes Infighting Atop Flagship Ethereum Project MakerDAO,"The non-profit entity behind ethereum's hottest decentralized startup is wracked with infighting, a legal letter obtained by CoinDesk reveals.  The letter, dated April 1, is from an attorney representing five board members of the Cayman Islands-based MakerDAO Ecosystem Growth Foundation (MEGF) who say they were pressured to resign by CEO Rune Christensen in late March.  The MakerDAO Foundation controls roughly 30 percent of all the MKR tokens in existence and its nine-person board is tasked with overseeing funds related to the development of the network. The network itself runs a two-token protocol with a combined market cap between MKR and DAI of $661 million.  Earlier this month, CoinDesk reported on simmering tensions during an April 9 community call regarding the recent reconstitution of MEGF’s board of directors. The newly-obtained letter, signed by attorney Andrew Pullinger of the Cayman Islands law firm Campbells, sheds light on a potential source of those tensions.  According to the letter, CEO Christensen demanded the five board members “resign or be replaced as directors on the basis of wrongful allegations that our clients had engaged in a ‘conspiracy’ and breached their fiduciary duties as directors.”  No members of MEGF’s board have ever been publicly revealed, with the foundation claiming that identifying them would constitute a “security risk.”  The Pullinger letter names David Currin, Denis Erfurt, Thomas Pulber, James Reidy and Kenny Rowe as the five board members who were asked to resign.  The feud, the letter states, ostensibly started with Christensen’s discovery of a Signal chat group started in February called the “Purple Pill Discussions.”  Though what that name refers to is not explained in the letter, the term is associated with online “men’s rights” forums. The term is also used as a nickname for a heartburn medication.  CoinDesk contacted MakerDAO to verify the letter's authenticity and to ask several additional questions pertaining to its contents. The organization’s head of communications, Mike Porcaro, simply responded:    ""With an ever changing business landscape, it’s expected that the Maker Economic Growth Foundation may experience the occasional growing pain as we work to support the MakerDAO project. In accordance with our mutually agreed upon foundation documents and procedures, changes to board were recently made.      Out of respect for privacy and confidentiality we will not provide additional comment.""    While Pullinger's letter does not threaten legal action, it does maintain that his clients are technically still members of the MEGF board.  “Our clients can only be removed as directors in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands and the Articles of Association,” the letter states. “The CEO is unable to act unilaterally to remove directors.”  Additionally, the letter says the five clients are still committed to the project and that their “strong preference is to resolve these issues amicably.”  “We therefore invite the CEO and the executive team to discuss these issues so as to explore whether there is a means of resolving them by agreement,” Pullinger wrote. He also notes: ""Our clients reserve all of their rights."" (Pullinger did not reply to multiple requests for comment.)  CoinDesk attempted to reach those named in the letter but was not able to contact Erfurt. Only the MakerDAO Foundation provided a comment.  Notably, one of the questions that MakerDAO did not answer pertained to whether or not board members (past and present) are under any kind of non-disclosure agreement.  Following the CEO's discovery of the Purple Pill Discussions, two meetings were convened, according to the letter. The first meeting, on March 22, was with the alleged participants. The second meeting, on March 25, was an ""Emergency All Hands"" attended by “in excess of 60 people,” according to the letter.  At that meeting, the letter quotes Christensen as saying:  “These ‘conversations’ had ‘...put the entire project at critical risk’ and ‘...the livelihoods of all of you working for the project at stake...’”  It is not known at this time if any or all of the five named have actually been removed or if new board members had been added. At the time of the board reorganization announcement, MEGF described its search as underway and current technical members as transitioning to a committee.  The post said:  ""Transparency is a fundamental pillar of how the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation envisions its relationship with the wider community.""  Shortly after CoinDesk's outreach, an anonymous correspondent wrote to address our questions about the MEGF reorganization, describing it as ""Governance theater.""  “The pretext on which the directors were removed is false, and a distraction,” the anonymous email stated.

Of that loan book, bitcoin-denominated loans made up 68 percent, XRP loans 6.7 percent and ethereum and litecoin loans 3.6 percent each.  But perhaps most notably, short sellers now account for only 3 to 5 percent of Genesis' bitcoin loans, down from about half in early 2018, Michael Moro, the CEO of Genesis' trading and lending businesses, told CoinDesk.  The ability to sell crypto short, or bet that its price would fall by selling borrowed coins, “was a missing piece for a long time, something that exists in any other existing established world. You can short gold, stocks, why can’t you short cryptocurrency?” Moro said, explaining why Genesis' loans were initially so popular for this purpose, adding:  ""But this speculative bet on the downside of bitcoin started to disappear towards the end of 2018 and now it doesn’t exist.”  The predominant category of borrowers for Genesis now is exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks, which prefer to keep clients’ funds in cold, or offline, storage and settle trades with borrowed coins, he said.  Altcoin shorting  If interest in shorting bitcoin has dwindled, that's not the case for other cryptocurrencies.  “Short sellers pretty much exist in altcoins: ether, litecoin,” Moro said. “Maybe there is some kind of bitcoin maximalism built-in in long term, or the cost of shorting it is too high.”  There was also “a lot of short interest in XRP” during the third quarter of 2018, “but that trend steadily diminished towards the end of the year and hasn’t reignited thus far in 2019,” according to Genesis' quarterly report released Thursday.  In the report, Genesis shows a clear correlation between the price movements and borrowing activity of the company's clients. And as ether and litecoin prices go down, the amount of loans rises, Genesis’ charts show.  Interestingly, shorting patterns for different cryptos vary, the analysis shows. For example, for bitcoin, so far in 2019 there is little correlation to be seen between the volume of loans and the price.  For ether and litecoin, the link is clearer: as the price declines, people borrow more coins, and as it goes up they pay back the loans. However, “unlike ETH, LTC borrow returns preceded major rallies rather than trailed – indicating better information or better understanding of momentum in the asset,” the report says.  For example, in early February, there was an uptick in ether shorting when the coin was trading at $100; ""loans outstanding ballooned to the highest level over the quarter,"" the report says. They dropped 30 percent on February 7, after the price went up to $120. A week later, the price rallied again to $140, lowering the appetite to short.  ""Our borrowers likely covered shorts after [the] price had already moved against their positions,"" the report suggests.  As for litecoin shorting: in mid-March, clients borrowed a lot as the price was around $60, ""another level speculators believed to be a top. But that belief was not correct and yet again, the shorts covered before the price rallied swiftly to $90. Like clockwork, they re-engaged after the price established itself in the $80-90 range,"" the report says.  Genesis borrows crypto from ""whale"" investors, including some individual early bitcoiners, Moro said. The firm borrows at a 4 to 5 percent interest rate and lends at 6.5 to 7.5 percent; the interest is paid in crypto.  The company doesn't hold these coins in cold storage, Moro said: As soon as a borrower pays back crypto, it gets lent out to another client as soon as possible from the hot wallet.  “Every coin we have is for lending,” he said.  Another, newer part of Genesis’ business is fiat loans, although it’s still in a pilot phase. Launched at the end of 2018, cash loans now account for 10 percent of Genesis’ portfolio.  The clients on this side are hedge funds that want to get some extra operational cash without using their clients' funds, Moro says. They post 120 percent collateral in crypto and are subject to margin calls if the fiat value of it falls below 105 percent.  The crypto lending market is starting to get more competitive, with firms like BlockFi and Celsius entering the fray. Moro believes the popularity of crypto loans and crypto-collateralized cash loans is due to the fact that investors want to hold their bitcoin, and to the general maturing of the market.  He concluded:  “No one wants to sell bitcoin and people want more of it. As for the institutional investor crowd, many entered the market in 2017, and they are used to [being able to] go long and go short, so you have a match of people who want to lend and borrow. Back in 2014-2015, we didn’t have borrowing demand, these people just were not in business yet.”  Michael Moro image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,LTC,BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/25/genesis-lends-425-million-of-crypto-in-q1-and-not-just-to-short-sellers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c589546c21e5b8a3fd5e0cf46ce796b0c34f04d-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381788,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pX3j,1556190932,Bitcoin Faces Deeper Price Pullback Before Rally Continuation,"View  Bitcoin fell more than 1 percent yesterday, confirming a bearish divergence of the 14-day relative strength index, an early sign of bearish reversal.  BTC risks falling to levels below $5,000 in the next few days.  A strong bounce from the crucial 30-day moving average (MA), currently at $4,969, would revive the short-term bullish outlook.  The long-run outlook will remain bullish as long as the price is holding above the former resistance-turned-support of $4,236 (Dec. 24 high).  Bitcoin (BTC) may revisit sub-$5,000 levels in the short-term, as a widely followed technical indicator is flashing a historically bearish pattern.  With the recent rally to five-month highs above $5,600, the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed the 200-day MA from below in what's termed a ""golden crossover"" – a confirmation of long-term bull market.  However, short-term technical indicators, especially a bearish divergence on the relative strength index (RSI), are suggesting a drop in prices before the rally picks up pace again.  The bearish RSI pattern is widely considered an early sign of trend change and has yielded notable price pullbacks in the past.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $5,430 on Bitstamp – down 3.5 percent from the high of $5,627 hit earlier this week.  Daily chart        Bitcoin first jumped above $5,000 on April 1 and further climbed to highs above $5,400, lifting the 14-day RSI to 88.00 – the highest level since December 2017.  With the indicator signaling extreme overbought conditions, bitcoin’s price retreated to $4,912 on April 12 before jumping to a five-month high of $5,627 earlier this week.  Essentially, BTC created a bullish higher low at $4,912 and a higher high of $5,627. However, as bitcoin set the new higher high, the RSI instead formed a bearish divergence – a pattern confirmed with the near 2 percent price drop seen in the last 24 hours.  Historical RSI divergence  As can be seen above, BTC confirmed a bearish divergence of the RSI with a 2 percent drop to $9,623 on May 6, 2018, and fell 38 percent to lows below $5,800 by the end of June.  Before that, the 14-day RSI diverged in favor of the bears with bitcoin’s 6.5 percent price drop to $17,700 on Dec. 19, 2017. That was followed by a quick 36 percent sell-off to $11,200 by Dec. 22.  There are earlier notable examples, too (not shown). BTC fell 6.5 percent to $4,600 on Sept. 2, 2017. With the sharp slide, the RSI diverged in favor of the bears and prices tumbled to $2,972 on Sept. 15. Again that was a 36 percent price drop.  Another bearish divergence of the RSI on June 12, 2017, was also followed by a quick 20 percent price slide that ended at lows near $2,120 a few days later.  If history is any guide, the latest bearish divergence of the RSI could send prices down to $4,912 (April 12 low).  Daily chart  The 30-day moving average (MA), which served as strong support in March, is currently located at $4,969. Importantly, the average is still trending north, indicating a bullish setup.  A strong defense of that average would revive the short-term bullish outlook and could yield a rally to fresh multi-month high above the recent high of $5,627.  A violation there, however, could invite stronger selling pressure, leading to a drop to the 200-day MA at $4,466.  The longer-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above $4,236 – the bearish lower high created on Dec. 24 and violated on April 2.

42381772,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pWkr,1556186433,Top 3 Japanese Bank to Roll Out Services on Marco Polo Blockchain,"Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), Japan’s third-largest bank by total assets, will launch blockchain-based trade finance services in the second half of this year.  SMBC’s vice chairman Yasuyuki Kawasaki announced the news at a recent fintech seminar in Tokyo, saying that the bank will roll out new services for import and export companies using the Marco Polo trade finance blockchain platform, CoinDesk Japan reported Thursday.  Kawasaki said that, traditionally, trade finance is a “very complicated,” paper-based and time-consuming process. SMBC completed a proof-of-concept using the blockchain platform back in February, aiming to improve its trade operations. It said at the time that the platform ""provides paperless, real-time connectivity and easier access.""  The Marco Polo network – built on blockchain software startup R3’s Corda platform – saw its first real-world transactions going live last month. The network was founded by R3 and trade finance specialist TradeIX.  The transactions took place between two German companies. One transaction involved the delivery of special hydraulic couplings from Germany to China and the other the delivery of pumps within Germany.  Since launching in 2017, the Marco Polo network has added some major financial institutions as members, including ING, BNP Paribas and Commerzbank, among others.  Announced this morning, BayernLB, Helaba and S-Servicepartner have also joined the Marco Polo network ""for piloting and evaluating purposes.""  Daniel Cotti, managing director, Centre of Excellence for Banking and Trade for Marco Polo, said:  “Today, we have the resources and technology to transform the way banks serve their trade finance customers and enable easier access to credit, while minimizing risk and increasing transparency.”  Trade finance is increasingly being eyed as a beneficial use case for blockchain technology. Last July, another trade finance blockchain platform called We.Trade – built on Hyperledger Fabric and with nine banks on board – went live.  Just yesterday, China’s forex regulator and manager, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), said that it has developed a blockchain system aimed to address inefficiencies in cross-border trade finance. Pilots in three regions and two cities are now planned.

Ripple further said that direct institutional sales of XRP totaled $61.93 million in Q1 – 54 percent more than the previous quarter. Programmatic sales of the cryptocurrency, meanwhile, grew from $88.88 million to $107.49 million, an increase of 21 percent.  It's not all good news, though.

Further, looking at the year-on-year figures, XRP sales have not shown significant growth.

In perhaps the most striking example, the regulatory framework drafted by Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), the country’s financial markets overseer, aims to remove a longstanding point of contention faced by such startups: banking relationships.  Under the framework, firms that opt in to be regulated are guaranteed a bank account. This is a long way from the U.S., where regulators’ warnings about “reputation risk” have tacitly discouraged banks from providing deposit accounts to digital currency businesses.  According to Domitille Dessertine, head of the fintech, innovation and competitiveness division at AMF, “strong feedback” from crypto players on the need for adequate banking was matched by firm consensus from the French authorities.  The French government and legislators “were very supportive of this right and entitlement to open a bank account as long as you are regulated,” said Dessertine, who has been shepherding the new rules over the past two years.  Under the new law, the burden is now on banks to explain why they won’t serve startups, she explained:  “The relationship between the project and the bank remains contractual, but if the banks refuse then they will need to justify with us why they have refused to open a bank account.”  Dessertine said a parallel can be drawn with crowdfunding a few years ago, where banks were reluctant to open accounts for such platforms because money was coming from the internet. However, today this works fine, she noted, stating that “all types of banks, large and small,” will be subject to the new provision.  But this new requirement is just part of wide-ranging blockchain bill adopted at its final reading in the French National Assembly on April 11. Part of PACTE Law, the government’s plan to create a new legal environment more favorable for growth of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), the bill also offers purveyors of initial coin offerings (ICOs), as well as “digital asset service providers” (such as exchanges and custodians), the option to attain a “visa” to operate in France.  Emilien Bernard-Alzias, a partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons in Paris pointed out that the French parliament and particularly its so-called “crypto-deputies” have wanted to make life easier for crypto-entrepreneurs for some time.  He told CoinDesk:  “Before PACTE law this was a struggle for crypto-related businesses to open a bank account with a French bank. But now French banks which refuse to open an account will have to explain their refusal before the French regulators and we can bet they would avoid having this discussion with the French regulators.”  Queuing up  Enthusiasm at the highest levels for France’s new crypto rules has been very clear.  Last week at Paris Blockchain Summit, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire proposed that the European Union use the bill as a model “to set up a single regulatory framework on crypto-assets inspired by the French experience.”  While the formal application process for firms to gain optional certification in France will not open until after the summer, there has already been plenty of interest, noted AMF’s Dessertine who said 20 to 30 digital asset service providers, including “large and small exchanges” have been in touch already.  She added:  “There has been significant interest in the new license proposed for digital asset service providers, which includes crypto exchanges, be they fiat to crypto or crypto to crypto. So if Huobi, for instance, wants this license it will be possible for them to ask for it.”  Dessertine explained the framework will be operational after the publication of the implementing decrees which will happen over the next couple of months. “We hope this will be enacted by May, or at the latest June,” she said. “We foresee the application process to be operational for ICOs by September and the intermediaries license we expect will be operational by year end, maybe a little earlier.”  The French regulator has also been careful about making the crypto visa optional, so as not to cramp innovation in this fast-moving space, said Dessertine, adding:  “There are some business models that may not fit within a regulatory framework. I’m thinking of fully decentralized projects where you don’t even have an identified corporate issuer, where it's really a community of people working together.”  It’s a sentiment echoed by Bernard-Alzias, who pointed out the new regulations are not designed to limit or control, but rather to attract.  “Neither PACTE law nor the AMF wants to force people to seek one of the optional licenses but if crypto-related firms want to take advantage of these optional licenses to appear more reliable and gain new clients or partners, they could,” he said. “And quite surprisingly, this works! Dozens and dozens of non-French crypto related firms already want to obtain these optional licenses even though the AMF should not start to grant them before September.”  Fund management  Another notable change allows France’s roughly $2.5 trillion worth of insurance funds to take on more exposure to crypto assets.  PACTE Law allows the French equivalent of hedge funds – specialized professional funds (FPSs) – greater freedom with regard to investing on behalf of life offices.  However, French legal experts believe such seismic shifts may still be some way off. Hubert de Vauplane, a partner at law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, said life insurance offices may have the possibility to invest in crypto thanks to the new PACTE law, “but honestly, at this time it is theoretical.”  De Vauplane highlighted practical impediments such as a lack of institutional grade custody solution for crypto assets. He also pointed out that certain types of funds under EU regulation (Alternative Investment Funds or AIFs) and French law are allowed to hold assets registered within a blockchain, including crypto assets.  “If a life insurance company wants to sell life product exposed in crypto (which is allowed), it is only possible via an AIF/ FPS fund. No custodian fund in France is yet prepared to accept to ‘keep’ crypto assets. But for sure, the offer will come soon,” he said.  Perhaps preparing to test the waters, a subsidiary of French financial colossus Societe Generale recently issued a covered bond (a traditional European instrument similar to mortgage-backed securities) in the form of a token on the public ethereum blockchain.  Although SocGen itself was the sole investor in the issuance, it is pari passu (“on an equal footing” in terms of repayment priority) with other covered bonds, according to a report from Moody’s Investors Service – suggesting that the lender could sell the bonds in the secondary market later on. SocGen’s issuance took advantage of a 2017 French decree that recognized blockchain as a valid recording system for securities, Moody’s noted.  The new rules also encourage French private equity or VC funds to get more involved in ICO tokens, allowing them to invest in crypto assets up to 20% of their assets under management (AUM).  In its approach to ICOs, France differs dramatically from the U.S., where the definition of a security is broad enough to capture many things. Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has famously said every ICO he’s seen is a security.  By contrast, the French definition of a security is narrow and means either a clearly defined financial derivative contract, or an instrument like a stock, bond, or unit share of a fund.  Dessertine concluded:  “To us, most of the tokens that were issued by ICOs and cryptos themselves do not fall within our definition of security.”  Paris Blockchain Week pic courtesy of Wachsman PR",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/25/banks-cant-snub-crypto-startups-thanks-to-frances-new-blockchain-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b27a7a2a127eedf0ad6ea4fb802fc9b5b1ef2d8-1500x896.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
