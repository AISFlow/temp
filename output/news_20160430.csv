42378693,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lM0X,1462051616,Consensus 2016 Hackathon Pushes Blockchain Beyond Finance,"The first day of the Consensus 2016 Hackathon saw over 20 blockchain entrepreneurs pitch their ideas and concepts to a wide array of developers from all over the world.  Gathered from as far away as Asia, Australia, and Europe, both entrepreneurs and Hackathon participants weighed concepts ranging from an app that verifies its user doesn’t have a sexually transmitted disease to a bank built from scratch on the blockchain.  The tools provided to coders, technologists and other Hackathon participants were brought to the table by some of the biggest names in the bitcoin and blockchain space today.  Event organizer and president of Blockchain University Robert Schwentker said that he hopes the wide range of blockchain tools and cash prizes inspire a new wave of distributed ledger development.  Schwentker told CoinDesk:  ""It brings together a quorum of developers as well as platform providers to spark innovation, to continue people’s personal interests as well as corporate interests in developing out apps in this ecosystem.""  An estimated 150 developers are attending the Building Blocks Hackathon, hosted at the Microsoft Technology Center in Times Square. The winner, set to be announced tomorrow, will receive $5,000 in cash as well as additional prizes. Other prizes for building on specific software are also being offered by event sponsors.  The pitches  The pitches presented by the blockchain entrepreneurs present during today's sessions captured a wide range possible applications. Notable concepts included an app concept that allows farmers to pre-sell digital tokens in exchange for fresh food, a distributed autonomous organization (DAO) aimed at boosting transparency in labor unions, a ""cryptobank"", and an app that lets potential romantic partners prove they don’t have any sexually transmitted diseases. That particular idea raised a notable round of applause from the audience.  Citing an Economist article from last year which reported lower rates of rape and sexually transmitted disease in certain areas following the legalization of prostitution, software developer Kevin Moran described how sex industry workers might be able to use such an app to automatically let partners know when they might be in danger.  Moran told attendees:  ""What it does is it allows two people to identify biometrically that they are free of venereal diseases. Some people might think this is silly but if you got it to enough saturation, when someone did get a venereal disease, it would do what the health department does now.""  Bill Bodell, another entrepreneur present, pitched a project called FarmShare that functioned as a modernized version of an existing business model for what he called a ""decentralized community supported agriculture platform"".  Bodel later argued that the idea benefits more clearly as it scales.  ""It seems like a pretty easy model to update with blockchain. Turn those shares into a token which then can be exchanged for fresh food,"" he told CoinDesk. ""The key is to scale it from being a single farm to being a network or community of farms and other food entrepreneurs.""  Hugo O'Connor of BitTrade Labs flew in from Australia to pitch his idea for UnionD, which seeks to help prevent corruption by decentralizing the organization structure of labor unions.  “My idea is to decentralize the union movement by putting unions on the blockchain as a decentralized autonomous organization,"" he said. ""Think of it as Uber for unions.”  While many of the pitches involved non-financial applications of blockchain technology, software developer Benson Evans pitched his idea to build a bank that can manage cryptocurrencies and digital assets.  ""Telling consumers about public addresses and private keys is not the way to go to get bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to scale,"" he said. ""We need to somehow build systems above that, simplify the process, and see public addresses and private keys as lower level.""  How to build on blockchain  Before the entrepreneurs and coders started the speed-dating portion of the Hackathon, when they mingled among each other on the sixth floor of Microsoft's spacious New York offices, event sponsors offered demos on the product and code being made available to participants.  Schwentker estimates that half the coders in attendance have never worked with blockchain, adding that tools that streamline development are fundamental to the education process and help participants meet competition goals during the two-day event.  Representatives from Microsoft's Azure computing platform demonstrated how to access their “sandbox” environment for building blockchain applications. IBM showed how developers could build their products using a customized version of the Fabric distributed ledger being created by Hyperledger, a project of which it is a founding member.  Three projects under the ConsenSys umbrella — BlockApps, Truffle, and Ether.Camp — all demoed how participants might use their tools as well.  Among the sponsor challenges, which included cash and digital currency-denominated prizes, was an offer by Deloitte to fly the team it dubs most commercially viable to Atlanta, Georgia, to work directly with its innovation team.  ""We want you to crate a killer app that will benefit our customers,"" Deloitte's director of payments integrity, Prakash Santhana, told attendees.  At last year's Consensus 2015 Makeathon, the killer app ended up being Tierion, a startup that hashes receipt data on a blockchain. After it's founder Wayne Vaughan, earlier this week announced he raised $1m he offered a reward of a single bitcoin – worth about $450 at press time – to the hackathon attendee or CoinDesk reader who provides him the best definition of a ""blockchain"".  The two-day event precedes the Consensus 2016 blockchain technology event, which kicks off Monday at 7am. The sold-out, three-day event consists of 143 speakers, including Delaware Governor Jack Markell, 21 Inc. CEO Balaji Srinivasan, and R3CEV CEO David Rutter.

42378688,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLuF,1462031886,Translucent Regulation: Fear and Loathing in a Blockchain World,"Jonathan Levin is chief revenue officer and co-founder at blockchain analytics firm and European Cybercrime Centre partner Chainalysis.  In this opinion piece, Levin discusses the transparency the bitcoin blockchain offers and how it could shift and challenge our perception of privacy in a digital age.  The year is 1766 and Sweden has just passed the world’s first law enabling the public to access government information.  Since then, transparency has been instilled in Swedish culture. Today, Swedish politician and European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström is the only Commissioner that publishes her external correspondence in a publicly accessible register.  Bold acts of transparency undoubtedly help democracy and protect society. However, private companies have competitive pressures and, in general, need to be coerced through regulation.  As tech companies bring the offline and online worlds ever closer together, we are challenged to find ways of writing physical legislation to manage this new arrangement. Attempts to fit technology companies that match individuals to perform services, like Uber and AirBnB, have all but failed.  Bitcoin as a case study  As the stakes behind these attempts further increase as these companies scale, we need case studies to learn how we are going to mitigate risk for society.  The bitcoin industry has been navigating the regulatory maze for almost five years. But, the complexity of financial regulation in the US has left many wondering around what sometimes feels like the Nevada desert.  While the decentralized model of bitcoin and the data that is produced through using the system have still not been fully appreciated, as always with bitcoin, perhaps it is asking bigger questions than its current incarnation may first allow us to imagine.  Is bitcoin’s transparency so clear we barely see it?  A bitcoin company's business activities have a level of transparency by default. Companies like ours are able to identify the levels and nature of this activity due to the public nature of the blockchain and specific attributes of bitcoin transactions.  This does not mean we get information on the identities of the customers of these companies, but, for example, we have a good estimate of transaction volumes, the source and destination of funds.  This is particularly helpful for the company themselves as this provides both business intelligence and the ability to detect potentially suspicious activity.  State of trust  However, this information is not only useful to the company itself but to other stakeholders in the ecosystem.  Consider a bank that offers banking services to the bitcoin company. They are now able to receive reports on the levels and nature of blockchain activity for their on-boarded clients. Money service businesses (MSBs) are typically on-boarded using a reliance model.  Reliance is about establishing trust. Trust is expensive for small firms or even unattainable. The bank must get very comfortable that the compliance standards kept by the company meet their expectations given that they have potentially little information to monitor its on-going activity.  This has led to the worrying collapse of this model as the regulators have pressured banks through large fines to close many of the bank accounts of these money service businesses.  The irony of all of this is the raison d’être of these businesses is the difficulties banks have in serving targeted segments of the population.  But, enough about the current state of the world. For those interested you can read about the shortcomings of the current AML agenda.  The main question is: In places where levels of identity proofing are low or possibly non-existent, should financial transactions be completely open? Or reversed, for certain financial transactions should the need for high levels of assurance be necessary?  In the bitcoin space, the level of identity proofing behind a bitcoin addresses is non-existent. That is its appeal. In some other parts of the payment ecosystem, the level of identity proofing is as good as non-existent and there are no technical solutions to mitigate risks such as fraud or money laundering.  In bitcoin, digital traces are left alongside every transaction opening the possibility of risk management. As people consider the possibilities of blockchain technology, should we also consider this transparency a possible benefit?  Self-reported vs self-enforcing  The process of audit and self-reporting requirements necessitates the the old way of regulation, which requires permissions be granted in advance.  Nick Grossman wrote an excellent white paper on adapting our regulatory paradigm for the Internet age. Essentially, the argument is that we can produce a lot more data today in real time than ever possible in the past. This production of information can mitigate some concerns, which in the past has been met with onerous reporting requirements.  I would like to extend this idea to include the prospect of being able to have self-enforcement rather than just data sharing.  Consider bitcoin once more. When companies choose to do business on the bitcoin blockchain, they are binding themselves to a degree of transparency that regulators and the public can use. If more companies use these types of protocols, then we can enforce the promise of greater information sharing without getting into complex data sharing arrangements.  The transparency of bitcoin does not mean that crime has been eliminated, far from it. However, it can be used as a case study of where the amount of real time data sharing can be appreciated by regulators and a framework of lower barriers to entry considered.  Society, in general will not agree on the maximum number of days an apartment can be rented out for short-term rentals; or what mileage someone can drive in a leased car; or what levels of reporting is needed from a business that conducts transactions in the public domain, but at least we have examples we can already start to use.  Fear and Loathing of transparency  When I point to examples of where Chainalysis is able to identify nefarious activity in the bitcoin blockchain, people present the full array of emotions from ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", from ecstasy to torment.  Generally, the fear does not arise from privacy concerns but rather a concern that someone else can see what they see. A transaction that slips from view could be picked up by a regulator or a law enforcement agency and draconian fines likely issued. In today's paradigm, this is scary, but in the new world of regulation, this would be seen a great intervention.  The analogy that I would draw would be in a zero-day vulnerability. If a friendly someone outside your company reports a vulnerability to you, you are over the moon and probably send them money and gifts. You do not complain that they should not have been snooping around your system. This creates much more secure systems and are in everyone’s interest.  Likewise, we could help Internet businesses police themselves better if they gave us incentives and data to help monitor their services.  But, people loath transparency for their love of privacy. This is a delicate issue and one that our business navigates on a daily basis. The ideal outcome is one of translucency.  An ability to judge the implications for society without compromising the civil liberties of individuals. Leaning on bitcoin once more, the exchanges and hosted wallets actually ensure a level of privacy for the individual user. Chainalysis can navigate through transactions but the exchanges are the custodians of individual identities.  When it comes to rides or stays in people’s homes, this is going to be more difficult but there are many smart minds working on this. (Watch these guys Cognitive Logic, among others).  The shift toward this regulatory paradigm seems inevitable but may take a long time. We may find ourselves lost at times stumbling around what seems to be the Nevada desert, but as Hunter S Thompson wrote:  ""When the going gets weird, the weird turn professional.""

42378680,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lLlR,1462030753,Bitcoin's Messy Push for Innovation is Winning Over Payments Developers,"A recent dispute within the W3C's Web Payments groups has given skeptics of bitcoin's sometimes chaotic development process ""cause for pause"" when thinking about the best way to deploy new financial technology.  The dichotomy between W3C and the bitcoin community's approach to technology gained prominence in February, when a few members of W3C’s web payments groups were first vocal about what they deemed a lack of participation from blockchain innovators, specifically those in the bitcoin community.  That call for participation led Blockstream to join the group’s efforts, which might spur other bitcoin companies to come onboard as well.  However, a notable rift has now divided the W3C Web Payments Working Group after the perceived influence of browser vendors on the process prompted questions about the overall model. During a February decision centered on determining which specifications to work towards, Google and Microsoft seemed to garner too much control over the web payments standard, according to several individuals involved.  Manu Sporny, chairman of the W3C’s Web Payments Community Group, has now been faced with a key question – is it better to lead with code, or is having a more formal process like the W3C's a better model?  Both have benefits and drawbacks, but right now, he’s less enamored with the W3C process.  Sporny told CoinDesk:  ""It looks like two of the largest companies have undue influence over the process.""  Just last month, Sporny came under fire for expressing concern that the bitcoin ecosystem hasn't joined the W3C web payments work because they’re emboldened by hype.  The W3C was coming at standards from a legacy institution’s viewpoint – that there was a more professional process in place that, while slow, has proven successful for web standards since its creation in 1994.  The dispute  The Web Payments work was focused around a browser-based API that would streamline and standardize the process of paying online in an effort to decrease shopping cart abandonment.  Since October 2015, the W3C has been incubating two different web payments specifications towards this goal – one built by the Web Payments Community Group and the other being developed by the browser vendors. This was a strange move, but the groups were assured both specifications would be merged together, rather than one being elected over the other.  Sporny has blogged about the W3C's work and the issue, detailed here.  But that didn’t happen. The work the Web Payments Community Group put into a specification was scrapped for the spec the browser vendors introduced, and on 21st April, the first public working draft was published for feedback from the Web Payments Working Group.  According to Ian Jacobs, the W3C’s payments activity lead, there was significant support for the documents the group published. Out of the 22 member groups that voted, 15 members supported all four documents that make up the spec. There are 42 member groups altogether.  ""A lot of people were fine with it, but I think a lot of us just wanted the bickering to stop,” said Shane McCarron, projects manager at Spec-Ops.io, a group that identifies critical open standards and helps to move those along and the company’s liason to the web payments work.  While McCarron thinks the decision was short-sighted, he remains optimistic. Currently the group is integrating concepts from the community group’s spec into that of the browser vendor’s where there are weaknesses.  Internet pioneer Pindar Wong has been surveying the situation in a similar way as Sporny.  The question, for him, becomes whether the fast and messy open-source development that blockchain protocols like bitcoin and Ethereum use is better than the slow and steady – and maybe financially conflicted – professional standards work.  Wong, chairman of Hong Kong-based FinTech infrastructure consultancy VeriFi Inc, has been active in the bitcoin community and is also a member of the W3C Web Payments Community Group. He’s straddled both the open-source community and professional standards world for some time.  Sure, Wong admits, the progress in the bitcoin community has been chaotic, most recently as it relates to proposed increases to the network's block size, and those impassioned arguments all happen in the public eye.  But that passion in an open environment is why so many people are drawn to the bitcoin space.  Control and conflict  Sporny asserts some members of the web payments working group have been able to exert more control over the process – and this cat-and-mouse game could have something to do with relevancy.  The W3C stays relevant because of the participation from large, professional businesses such as Google and Microsoft. Plus, large enterprises pay substantial membership fees, upwards of $80,000 a year.  To avoid the conflicts of interest that may arise, the W3C has set up a transparent process, recording and transcribing group phone calls. But there have been workarounds, including Web Payments meetings that have been closed to reporters and members taking measures to sometimes go off the record.  While Sporny and Wong are rethinking whether the W3C is the best place to develop an open and free Internet of value, the two men also worry that the bitcoin community is headed in the same direction, with venture capitalists and large companies enjoying more say in debates. And this centralizing tendency can often lead to monopolies or oligopolies.  Such meetings are borne out of a desire to make consensus easier to reach, Wong said, but they run the risk of giving more say to those who may put their business models before the network itself.  Full circle  In this way, recent developments in both the web payments and bitcoin communities seem to mirror each other. And such a development is not without historical precedent.  When the Internet was young, developers were largely in favor of a technology open for everyone to use. But as the industry has grown, creating billion-dollar companies along the way, it looks like it’s moving towards ossification – the tendency toward rigid, conventional and unimaginative states of being, said Wong.  In the W3C's case, the group’s initial declaration nearly four years ago was to build technological web infrastructure for open financial services, allowing more people to pay in the way they were comfortable with online.  It was an ambitious and idealistic goal.  But out of this came a new objective, one that's arguably more realistic – the desire to build an API that focused on eliminating shopping cart abandonment by standardizing the online checkout experience.  Sporny wondered where this ""first-world problem"" came from, but decided it was all just baby steps in the process to democractize payments online.  It is not that shopping cart abandonment isn’t a problem for online retailers, it's just that the razor-focus on the issue seems too narrow for the project’s original priority of leveling the playing field and creating a fair market.  Given this focus, as well as the browser vendor spec, Sporny worries other stakeholders will be at a disadvantage.  The current spec doesn’t take into account third party applications like bitcoin wallets, bank-branded payment apps or merchant loyalty cards because that work could take a while to complete and could stall the ability to deploy the API and get early feedback from developers.   By rushing the spec through that only the browser vendors can implement and get people accustomed to, that could make it a struggle to add-on other applications in the future since consumers would have to readjust to a new process.  This isn’t necessarily the browser vendor’s evil little plan; instead, Sporny thinks the representatives that Google and Microsoft have sent to the W3C don’t have the time or support from their parent companies to work long hours ironing out the kinks. Most of the representatives work with the W3C as a side project.  Google representatives have said that third party applications are important but haven’t prioritized that, instead looking to ship something fast and iterate later.  But leveling the playing field is becoming an increasingly pressing issue as the next billion people – those in developing countries – gear up to come online, said Wong. He wants a web experience that’s empowering, ""where people don’t have to wait for the banks or the telephone companies or the Internet companies to reach out to them and their geographic areas"".  This example is analogous to bitcoin, where the conversation several years ago focused on allowing consumers and merchants to take commerce into their own hands with the ability to pay quickly and securely without getting gouged by fees from the various intermediaries.  But as more money was invested and technical details were hashed out, particularly on the regulation front, the dialogue has shifted to defining bitcoin as a censorship-resistant payment mechanism, not necessarily one that equalizes payments.  ""It raises the question around who’s beholden to who when developing technology on an international scale,"" Sporny said. ""The blockchain stuff for all its messiness is not seeing the potential for two companies to take over the development of the work, yet.""
