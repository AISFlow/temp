42426934,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxerh,1465419814,BlockCypher Releases Ethereum API Toolkit for Developers,"Blockchain app development startup BlockCypher has expanded its platform to include support for Ethereum, a move the company says will see professional services firm Deloitte among its first users.  BlockCypher  CEO and co-founder Catheryne Nicholson says the addition of Ethereum was in response to an increased demand from more than half of the startup's client base, which also counts remittance app startup Abra among those using the new toolset.  Speaking with CoinDesk at the Exponential Finance Conference in New York, Nicholson estimated that more than half the company’s developers have asked for an Ethereum integration.  Nicholson said in an interview:  ""Our bread and butter is developers. What they ask us for is what we implement. The number one ask was Ethereum, so we had to bring to life our APIs on the Ethereum blockchain.""  Launched in 2014 to provide app-building services for blockchain developers, the company last year raised $3m in a seed funding round from Tim Draper and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang’s AME Cloud Ventures, among others.  Deloitte and Ethereum  The beta release launched today includes APIs for hosting Ethereum accounts, tracking balances and facilitating transactions.  Nicholson says the platform's Turing-complete programming language has driven interest among the startup's customer base.  ""It’s a much more robust scripting language,"" she said. ""It’s easier. It’s in standard programming language user interfaces, it’s not a machine language.""  According to Deloitte principal Eric Piscini, his team of 12 US-based blockchain specialists have been working with the startup to develop two prototypes built on the bitcoin blockchain.  What attracted Piscini to the Ethereum integration, he said, is that the blockchain team won’t have to learn any new skills to start building with the new offerings. Deloitte announced that it was first working with BlockCypher earlier this year.  Piscini told CoinDesk:  ""If you need smart contracts you will mostly go to Ethereum if you need a basic exchange of value you use the bitcoin blockchain.""

42426925,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxebh,1465413252,Maker of First Bitcoin Mining ASIC Acquired in What Could Be Industry's Largest Sale,"The China-based company behind the first bitcoin mining ASIC has been acquired, though the exact details of the sale vary.  Canaan Creative  , the company that produces the Avalon chip series, confirmed its acquisition by Shandong Luyitong Intelligent Electric PLC today in an email to CoinDesk. Shandong Luyitong is an electronics firm founded in 2003, and that is publicly listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.  As for the exact amount paid in the acquisition, initial statements from parties involved or close to the deal indicate it could be the largest-ever exit for bitcoin startup.    According to news source Ifeng.com, Shandong Luyitong paid ¥3.06bn (roughly $466m) in stock purchases and cash to acquire 100% ownership of the firm. Further, it said Shandong Luyitong is planning a private share offering in conjunction with the sale, looking to sell as many as 6.79 billion shares at a price of ¥24.57 per share.  In a separate Twitter post, Jihan Wu, CEO of China-based bitcoin mining firm Bitmain, reported that the firm was to be publicly listed through its relationship with Shandong Luyitong, and that it is seeking to raise ¥0.67bn at a valuation of ¥3.1bn.  Representatives of Canaan did not immediately provide more details, stating they were unable to disclose more than what is public at this time.  The Avalon chip was the first application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for bitcoin mining to hit the market, or the process by which new transaction blocks are created on the bitcoin network. Canaan Creative was founded in 2012, releasing its first Avalon chip the following year.  The company has made no official announcement about the deal through its social media channels. Shandong Luyitong did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42426926,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxeZh,1465406449,Realtor-Backed Incubator Invests in Ethereum Identity Startup,"A startup seeking to use the Ethereum blockchain and artificial intelligence to create an identity authentication system has been accepted into REach, an incubator backed by the investment arm of the National Association of Realtors (NAR).  Founded in 2015, Trust Stamp is now emerging from stealth mode, revealing $400,000 in funding for what it calls its FICO-like trust scoring system, with part of its funding coming from the REach incubator. The incubator is operated by Second Century Ventures, which is 100% owned by the NAR and conducts investments on behalf of the not-for-profit trade association.  Trust Stamp is one of seven companies that entered the REach incubator in April, alongside others that seek to serve different stakeholders in the real estate industry.  In interview, Trust Stamp founders Gareth Genner and Andrew Gowasack framed their product as one that could have a wide variety of applications in everything from real estate to online dating websites by allowing individuals to easily share aspects of their identity.  Genner told CoinDesk:  ""This is the basic concept of the Trust Stamp engine. We create an Ethereum contract which is unique to you, which becomes your identity. We hash the data to your private key, which unlocks the information of your data. Users can provide the legal verification of their identity, their photo, name and any other verified data.""  Mark Birschbach, managing director of REach, said that the incubator sees potential for blockchain technologies to ease frictions in the real estate industry. Still, Birschbach said that REach perhaps maintains a more conservative investment philosophy in line with its membership and industry interests.  ""We're looking at technologies that can aid our members rather than replace them,"" Birschbach said in an interview. ""We saw right away that this is a tool that could do well in the industry, but obviously there’s underlying tech that is interesting and far reaching.""  As evidence of this reach, Trust Stamp joins a number of other projects in the wider blockchain ecosystem seeking to provide trusted data verification. These include digital identity startups such as ShoCard and OneName, which have together raised nearly $3m in venture capital to date.  Further, the unveiling comes at a time when many technologists are beginning to examine the ability for blockchain tech to solve problems related to identity. For example, the ID2020 summit, held in May at the UN headquarters in New York, featured discussion about how blockchain solutions could come to serve as the digital foundations for providing such services.  Safety first  As for the need for the product, Birschbach further spoke to the impetus for REach’s investment in Trust Stamp.  As evidence of the gravity of the use case, he noted that one of the NAR’s realtor members was last year kidnapped and murdered, an event that has led REach to consider how technology could play a role in helping improve the safety of its members.  ""Last year, we had a technology in our program that was a safety device, a faster and easier way to indicate to 911 that the realtor might be in trouble. Trust Stump is an extension of that, where safety is still on everyone’s mind,"" Birschbach said.  As for his personal views on the technology, Birschbach said he sees the database management and digital transaction capabilities that blockchains enable as interesting, though he noted the real estate industry is not normally a first adopter.  ""I think it will take a while for this type of technology to penetrate the real estate industry,"" he said.  Framing the solution  As for how the product will work in practice, Trust Stamp’s founders said that sensitive consumer information will be stored off-blockchain, but that it would be accessible by its Ethereum smart contracts.  Today, this means users create an account, provide basic information (including a photo) connect social media applications (the information of which is then verified via other public databases) and share their trust scores with others.  Genner envisions an interface that will enable users to share different aspects of their identity as needed.  ""The contract says what you chose to share. At a minimum you have to share your legal personality, we have to know who you are. The contract then gives you the option to share other things,"" Genner said.  As an example for a potential use case, Genner said that real estate agents could use the tech to verify that someone seeking to view a million-dollar listing could actually purchase the home by requesting such information from other users.  Overall, Genner believes that Trust Stamp could deliver a better product that provides safety benefits in any situation where any professional or consumer is seeking to meet someone new.  ""At the moment, realtors are tying to handle it send your photo and drivers licenses, but what does that prove?"" he continued, concluding:  ""Even criminals have driver’s licenses.""

42426927,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxefh,1465402017,Banking Trade Group BAFT Seeks Bigger Role in Blockchain Policy,"An innovation effort launched earlier this year by a transaction banking trade group has set its sights squarely on blockchain technology.  Announced in September 2015, the Bankers Association of Finance and Trade (BAFT) Innovation Council was originally tasked to develop educational resources for a wide range of tools applicable to transaction banking, including but not limited to blockchain.  But after BAFT, a subsidiary of the American Bankers Association that is focused on cooperation among correspondent banks, hired two new people earlier this year to help manage the innovation effort, it became clear to those involved that blockchain needed to be a cornerstone of the group's ongoing efforts.  To do that, the group moved to hire a former Coinbase employee earlier this year, and in March submitted formal comment to a US banking regulator that is currently weighing its blockchain policymaking approach.  Hired in January  , BAFT senior vice president of payments and emerging technology John Collins – who served as head of government affairs for Coinbase – works directly with policymakers that interact with its member banks.  Now the vice president of international policy at BAFT, Collins said in an interview that the Innovation Council is likely to remain focused on blockchain for the foreseeable future, telling CoinDesk:  ""This is something that is of such great importance and such a focal point of our members — because either it's their entire business or a point their exploration — that it’s going to continue to be a point for us.""  One of the main objectives of the innovation effort is to help its members identify use cases for how blockchain can make trade more efficient, educating policymakers on blockchain and helping guide the conversation around the standard-setting practices Collins expects will take shape in the future.  Taking a stance  Headed by Samantha Pelosi, a former retail payments manager for the US Federal Reserve Board who is now BAFT's senior vice president, payments and innovation, the Council met earlier this year to discuss where its members stood on the subject of blockchain technology and, perhaps more vitally, identify the knowledge gaps its members face.  Some of the “larger, more vocal members” made it ""very obvious that blockchain was where they saw the biggest area of need"", according to Collins.  Since then, the group has sought opportunities to insert itself in ongoing policymaking discussions in the US, including a process currently underway at the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a banking regulator within the Department of the Treasury.  In March, BAFT’s Innovation Council responded to a paper published by the agency, advocating for lenient regulations similar to those implemented by the Clinton administration and a Republican-led Congress that have been widely credited with helping spur development during the early days of the Internet.  In the letterhttps://www.baft.org/docs/default-source/policy-department-documents/baft-occ-consultation---final.pdf?sfvrsn=0, BAFT CEO Tom Burwell wrote:  ""BAFT believes that governments should continue to allow [distributed ledger technology] to develop organically without imposing burdensome restrictions.""  Looking ahead  In addition to BAFT’s membership of international banks, new additions include nonbanking firms that are involved in the blockchain space, including startups Ripple and Skuchain, as well as IBM.  According to BAFT, the goal of involving these nonbank companies to help them connect with policymakers in order to educate them on the nature of the technology, as well as advocate for the needs of the industry.  This work, according to Collins, is still ongoing today.  Over the next couple months, Collins says he has a series of meetings scheduled with European regulators in London and Brussels. BAFT also meets with regulators in Washington, Milan, Dublin and Singapore regularly, he said.  Blockchain is also on the agenda for the organization's next major industry event. Next month, BAFT will co-host its annual global payments symposium in New York, with speakers from Ripple, Coinbase, R3CEV, Google, SWIFT, the Federal Reserve and IBM set to appear.

42426937,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxf1h,1465388370,Bitcoin Prices Soar in May: Analyzing the Market's Second Best Month of 2016,"With the price of bitcoin appreciating nearly 20% in May and breaking past $500 for the first time since 2014, it's safe to say the digital currency is once again back in the mainstream spotlight as an investment opportunity.  However, what may be most notable is that the gains took place amid strong overall sentiment. Data reveals the gains coincided with high long-short ratios and other indicators that sentiment is turning strongly bullish as we enter the summer months.  But, while May’s price rally may seem impressive due to the substantial media interest it's achieved, it was only the fourth-largest monthly gain in the last year, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals.  As recently as February 2016, bitcoin experienced a larger monthly increase, when it posted a gain of 18.92%.  By the numbers, May's monthly gain was slightly lower than that of February’s, when bitcoin prices rose from $367.14 to $436.61, an 18.92% increase. The May rally also fell short of November 2015’s monthly gain, when prices climbed 20.64% from $312.43 to $376.91.  Overall, the digital currency climbed 18.35% in May, opening at $449.33 and closing at $531.80, the second consecutive month in which it posted gains.  //  Perhaps most notable was the concentration of the price movement, however. The digital currency captured its entire monthly increase during the last five trading sessions, which spanned 27th May through 31st May.  Market sentiment  But how bullish were bitcoin traders in May?  Long volume always exceeded short volume, figures provided by full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub show.  A sampling of monthly data performed by Whaleclub shows that the lowest long-short ratio – as measured by position size – was 52%. In addition, confidence, meaning the percentage by which a particular day’s position sizes were larger than average, was at least 44% over the course of the month.  //  Additional Whaleclub figures show how optimistic market participants were in the last five sessions of May, when prices surged nearly 20%.  Long-short ratios reached at least 89% for nearly every session during this time, while confidence hit at least 80% every day except 31st May.  Volatility  Volatility – measured on a trailing week and trailing 30-day basis – was modest for much of the month, but picked up significantly during the end of May, an ARK Invest analysis of BPI data reveals.  //  Trailing week volatility was slightly higher between 20th May and 27th May, registering 2% every session except one. During the last four trading sessions, this measure surged, reaching 4% every day.  A broader measure, 30-day trailing volatility, started off at 1.28% on 1st May and then generally pushed higher during the month, reaching 2.44% on 31st May. This measure reached its highest point of the month on 28th May, when it hit 2.46.  It is worth noting that both 30-day and weekly volatility were higher in May than they were in April, but they fell short of the figures observed in January.  On 24th January, 30-day trailing volatility reached 4.84%. While this figure was nearly twice as high as 31st May’s 2.44%, it was more than six times the 0.73% reached on 17th April.  Commentary  As for why bitcoin rose nearly 20% in May, expert opinions were mixed.  Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, told CoinDesk that he believes the trigger for the specific timing was the attention drawn to the ecosystem by Ethereum, and its alternative digital currency ether.  ""Once BTC started to rally, lots of people piled into it, which created further gains,"" he said.  Petar Zivkovski, Whaleclub’s director of operations, also spoke to the relationship between ether and bitcoin, telling CoinDesk that the prices of the two currencies enjoyed an “almost perfect” inverse relationship during May.  ""This indicates that the market has positioned both currencies as pure competitors – should one asset be seen as succeeding, the other is seen as failing,"" he noted.  Daniel Masters, chief investment officer at Global Advisors pointed to other causal factors, stating that the upcoming decline in rewards for bitcoin miners on the network likely played a role. He emphasized that not only will this event take place soon, but that it will most certainly have consequences.  ""The bankruptcy of KnC is a clear signal that the economics of mining are being affected by the halving – I believe the price will be, too,"" he added.  June expectations  As for where experts believe ether prices will move going forward, experts matched overall market sentiment in their optimism.  Chris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at ARK Invest, weighed in on bitcoin’s future price movements, emphasizing that the currency’s 30-day daily volatility was far lower at the end of May than it was at its high on 24th January.  “Since we ended May with a trailing 30-day daily volatility of 2.44%, bitcoin is still less volatile than it was at the beginning of the year, but it will be really interesting to see how it behaves going into the halving,” he told CoinDesk.  While Burniske singled out liquidity as a key variable when providing commentary, and Adam White, vice president of business development and strategy at Coinbase, elaborated further on this factor in a recently released whitepaper.  Should the digital currency continue to attract more investor dollars, it could become increasingly investable through greater liquidity, he said.  Another factor that could potentially help bitcoin going forward is people finding new and innovative ways to utilize the blockchain, the electronic ledger that holds all the digital currency’s transactions.  Jack Liu, chief strategy officer of OKCoin, weighed in on this matter.  “If the attention returns to the bitcoin blockchain for a prolonged period due to halving, a scaling solution, and further use cases of the public blockchain, then markets look optimistic,"" he told CoinDesk.  At any rate, all eyes will be on the bitcoin community to see how effectively it harnesses blockchain’s applications, what progress it makes toward solving its perceived scaling challenges and how it will react to the decline in rewards scheduled to take place in July.
