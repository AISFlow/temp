The SEC alleged Friday that film producer Ryan Felton misappropriated funds and wash traded cryptocurrencies using the proceeds from two ICOs: FLiK, a digital streaming platform, and CoinSpark, a digital asset trading platform. TI and Atlanta residents Owen Smith, Chance White and William Spark, Jr. are charged with violating securities law for recommending investors buy tokens from one or the other of the sales without disclosing they were paid by the projects. There are three relief defendants as well.      Seven of the individuals, including T.I., settled their charges with the ICO.      The FLiK ICO raised about 539 ether (ETH), worth $164,665 at the time (late September 2018), while the CoinSpark ICO raised about 460 ether, worth about $282,418 in 2018, the SEC said in a separate complaint.      Felton now faces fraud and manipulation charges, according to the SEC.      T.I. ""offered and sold FLiK"" tokens, pretending to co-own the business and encouraging his followers to invest in the project.

42432646,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0cRh,1599859437,"SushiSwap's Users Ordered Changes, but the Protocol Can't Deliver Without an Overhaul","The Takeaway:    The SushiSwap community has voted on policy changes to the protocol to reduce the token reward schedule, introduce a lock-up period for newly minted Sushi, and introduce fee staking. But these changes can’t be made without first migrating to new smart contracts, a research firm told CoinDesk.  The current MasterChef contract doesn’t permit changes to the SushiToken contract, which in turn dictates other protocol functions for minting SUSHI tokens and for paying fee-staking rewards to SushiSwap holders.  Each smart contract would have to be manually migrated to make the changes, the research firm claims, though the SushiSwap team is looking for workarounds that don’t require as much heavy lifting.    The SushiSwap smart contract migration is complete but there’s a problem: Another migration may be needed if the team wants to implement changes to the protocol the SushiSwap community voted for.      Limitations in SushiSwap’s code make the proposed changes impossible without serious workarounds or alterations to SushiSwap’s code, namely another migration, blockchain research firm IntoTheBlock told CoinDesk.      The SushiSwap community just voted to decrease the Sushi token reward – a so-called liquidity provider (LP) token which is rewarded to sushi users who stake tokens in SushiSwap’s liquidity pools – from 100 SUSHI per block to 50, with successive halvings every two years. In addition, this change would include a “vesting” mechanism whereby two thirds of all newly minted SUSHI are locked for one year.      These vested tokens would earn transaction fees but could not be moved or used in voting until the year-long timelock expires. The vesting proposal is particularly germane to this project after its progenitor, Chef Nomi, sold off $13 million worth SUSHI tokens for ether last weekend. Chef Nomi recently forfeited this fortune, though, announcing on Twitter that he sent the 37,400 ether he garnered from trading in his SUSHI tokens to the SushiSwap treasury.      Read more: ‘I F**ked Up’: SushiSwap Creator Chef Nomi Returns $14M Dev Fund    Sushi unrolled    These proposals won a landslide majority vote among the community, but IntoTheBlock told CoinDesk SushiSwap’s current smart contracts aren’t flexible enough to bend the rules of the protocol.      The MasterChef contract, for instance, doesn’t allow for the reward schedule to be altered because the emission rate is “hard coded.”      “...[T]he current version of the MasterChef smart contract has hard coded the number of SUSHI tokens per block that can be awarded. This has been done via the sushiPerBlock variable which is initialized at a value of 100 at the contract creation time and can't be modified after that. You can see the reference in line 96 of the MasterChef smart contract. In simpler terms, changing the value of the sushiPerBlock variable would require deploying a new smart contract,” reads an IntoTheBlock research document shared with CoinDesk.      Read more: SushiSwap Will Withdraw Up to $830M From Uniswap Today: Why It Matters for DeFi      Fortunately, there is actually a fix for this limitation that doesn’t require another migration: Even if the reward is hard-capped, it’s possible to send extra rewards to a dead-end address that no one has access to (thus, to decrease rewards from 100 SUSHI to 50 SUSHI, every block reward would send 50 of the 100 SUSHI minted to this dead-end address).      “Although clever, this option is far from elegant and falls outside the original design of the SushiSwap protocol,” the report reads.    The great migration: What this would mean    More than inelegant, fixing the other limitations would require an overhaul of SushiSwap’s smart contracts entirely. The problem stems from a design choice wherein the MasterChef contract (which has control over the protocol) is not upgradeable and actually owns the SushiToken contract, so migrating to a new MasterChef contract (e.g., MasterChefV2) would also require deploying a new SushiToken contract (SushiTokenV2), according to IntoTheBlock developer Pablo Bianciotto.      “The limitation arises from the fact that MasterChef is not upgradeable,” he told CoinDesk. “To be upgradeable, the actual contract logic should be stored in another contract which is referenced by MasterChef. That would give you the flexibility to change minting/rewards distribution logic by replacing this secondary contract for a new one and updating MasterChef reference.      “In addition to that, SushiToken is owned by MasterChef, so creating a new MasterChef V2 contract with a new reward distribution logic and upgradeable features would require migrating the SushiToken contract, too.”      To upgrade the contract to implement vesting, for example, would require creating a MasterChefV2 and a SushiTokenV2 contract Bianciotto said.      FTX Exchange CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who is one of the multi-signature holders and was voted to be the new Master Chef by SushiSwap users, pushed back against this claim after publication.      “You can do vesting,” he told CoinDesk over direct message, “by sending the SUSHI emissions to a pool controlled by a smart contract that dictates the vesting schedule.”      Bianciotto confirmed that this is a feasible workaround, adding that it “can be seen as an extension of the solution” for sending new SUSHI to a burn address to control its emission rate.      Read more: Fishy Business: What Happened to $1.2B DeFi Protocol SushiSwap Over the Weekend      The code’s limitation, however, would still interfere with implementing the fee payout proposal because there’s no way to transfer the vested tokens from the MasterChef contract into another contract for fee staking.      “This part is even harder to do,” Bianciotto said. “To earn fee payments you have to stake SUSHI into the SushiBar contract, but if your SUSHI rewarded for staking is vested and sitting in MasterChef, you wouldn’t be able to transfer it from MasterChef to SushiBar to earn fee payments.” He added that a SushiBarV2 would need to be spun up to accommodate this change, as well as a new SUSHI token minting contract (SushiMakerV2).    A cascade effect    In effect, the MasterChef contract’s non-upgradeable nature creates a cascading effect wherein every smart contract under its control also requires an upgrade to make changes to the protocol. The SushiSwap team can implement the vesting and emission reduction proposals with the workarounds discussed above, but the only solution to make SushiSwap’s smart contracts upgradeable without these circuitous measures involves migrating each smart contract to a completely new version.      Seeing as each contract would need to be redeployed, this migration process would be more labor intensive than the previous one. Fully migrating each smart contract would involved taking a snapshot of all user’s balances and airdropping new tokens after the new contracts are deployed, as well as migrating individual user data from all of SushiSwap’s liquidity pools; users would also have to unstake all SUSHI tokens in the SushiBar and in SUSHI/ETH staking pools prior to the snapshot.      Biaciotto said that while the snapshot and airdrop may seem simple for user addresses, “smart contracts that rely on SushiToken could stop working unless they are upgraded to use the new SushiTokenV2.”      He also noted there “are no time constraints” for these changes. He recommended a transparent and methodical migration that also “clears the way to seamlessly adding/changing protocol features in the future” to avoid having to implement further changes through another migration.    Community response    CoinDesk reached out to SushiSwap’s newly elected leadership (those members who hold one of nine multisignature keys to dictate protocol development) to ask if they are planning another migration.      “No migration in the short term,” responded 0xMaki, the lead developer of SushiSwap, who has been with the project from the start. 0xMaki continued that they wish to implement the vesting and fee-staking proposals but that “it will require more thinking” to pull off.      Read more: SushiSwap Migration Ushers in Era of ‘Protocol Politicians’      Another team member insisted that such a migration would be “significantly less complicated” and that there is “no concern whatsoever of any problems on the horizon.” Bianciotto reaffirmed that since “SUSHI is owned by MasterChef,” that “any kind of migration is non-trivial.”      To corroborate IntoTheBlock’s research, CoinDesk reached out to Zokyo Labs, a blockchain security and development company with a DeFi studio. A Zokyo representative confirmed IntoTheBlock’s findings about the upgradable nature of Sushi's current smart contracts.

42432653,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0cdh,1599843159,Money Reimagined: Ending Money's Distance Trap,"For Australians of my generation, historian Geoffrey Blainey’s phrase the “tyranny of distance” was the defining descriptor of our place in the world, a place that seemed awfully far from everyone else.      In September of 2020, with hundreds of millions of broadband-connected homes using global video-conferencing services like Zoom and with remote work the norm for white-collar workers everywhere, we might believe distance is now a non-issue – not just for Aussies but for anyone. In the COVID-19 era, geography seems irrelevant.      But while the internet has removed location as a constraint on communication and leveled the playing field for building human and business connections, we can’t say the same for how we exchange value with each other – at least not yet. The cost of using money and the capacity for middlemen to charge transfer fees very much depends on where you are.      Location will determine how much it costs you to move money around the world: 1% transaction fees for sending to London from New York, for example, versus 19% from Botswana to London.      Just as important, it dictates the power structures within the management and control of money. After centuries of controlling the terms of the world’s financial deals, cities like New York and London have developed influential banking industries, which in turn have made those places powerful in their own right.      But for the first time, we have a vision for how this could change. The great promise of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins is that they could do for money what the internet did for communications. They could make the geography of finance obsolete.      Internet protocols like TCP/IP for data routing, VOIP for voice transmission and HTL for video streaming, combined with constant advances in file compression technology and cheap recording devices, have allowed people to exchange information directly, bypassing the telcos and other gatekeepers. They’ve made peer-to-peer communication available to all at essentially the same low cost.      Similarly, when everyone is using peer-to-peer money and intermediaries are no longer taxing and controlling our exchanges, barriers to entry will fall, as will the cost of payments. The capacity to transact will no longer vary according to where you are. And, in the long run, it will eat into the power of the world’s great financial centers.    KYC geography    Why hasn’t this happened already? Why hasn’t the rise of crypto forced the banking titans of New York, London and other financial centers to succumb to a more open system in the way that the telecom monopolies had to?      Because banks are completely entangled with political power. And, thanks to the continued dominance of nation-states, power is still tied to place.      The leaders of our financial system derive far greater advantages from their incumbency than the telcos ever did, in large part due to the barriers to entry that industrialized country banking regulations impose on potential competitors.      Some of those regulatory barriers exist in what appear to be benign and seemingly justifiable circumstances. Nonetheless, they create imbalance in geographic power.      Consider the asymmetric impact of know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering (KYC/AML) compliance rules. Installed at the behest of developed-world governments to track the money flows for rogue regimes, terrorists and international criminals, they impose big barriers on people living in much of the developing world, where regulations and enforcement aren’t as trusted.      After the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, and then following the financial crisis seven years later, a ratcheting up in compliance requirements and fines made U.S. bankers more risk averse. The upshot: “de-risking.” Investment flows to supposedly risky jurisdictions in developing countries slowed down, which meant fees on remittances and other financial transactions there rose, adding to the already high cost burdens that people in those countries face in trying to participate in the global economy.      Exemptions, in theory, allow people to send or receive funds up to $3,000 per day with only limited requirements for reporting their identification. But banks, chastened by massive fines imposed on HSBC and Standard Chartered and now heavily staffed with compliance officers whose instinct is to say “no,” don’t want to take any chances. So they apply blanket bans on people and businesses in places from Somalia to Venezuela. It also means bankers tend to view cryptocurrencies as tools to get around such rules, rather than focusing on their many advantages in reducing transactional friction and costs. It meant that crypto startups also got de-risked by banks.      Appeals to lighten such restrictions fall on deaf ears. The poor have no lobbying power; the politics of playing tough with international criminals carries much more populist appeal.      If anything, rules are getting stricter. The extension of the Financial Action Task Force’s “travel rule” to cryptocurrency exchanges is bringing in a vast new ID and reporting framework for the industry, which will make it even harder for people without trusted IDs to use them to send or receive money to or from abroad.      It’s frustrating because some of the most innovative solutions for controlling illicit finance, while still keeping payment corridors clean, come from crypto developers. By combining cryptographic privacy solutions such as zero knowledge proofs with the tracking capabilities found in blockchain provenance solutions, new AML modeling approaches promise to give both financial institutions and regulators a rich view of criminal money flow patterns without, for example, requiring Somalians to furnish IDs they don’t have. Check out this study by researchers at the IT-IBM Watson AI Lab, which ingested a giant trove of pseudonymous bitcoin transactions to draw conclusions on how many were illicit and where they were going.      But officials and banks simply aren’t open to anything that softens existing ID requirements. When I was at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, we explored a privacy-protected tracking project to help crypto exchanges stay compliant while allowing undocumented Mexican immigrants to send money home. The project stalled when, after various meetings, U.S. Treasury officials made it clear they thought we were just peddling naive crypto-anarchist ideas that would help only bad guys.    Preserving US power    The reality is that political resistance is about more than fighting drug dealers. It’s also driven by a desire to project and protect American power.      The reserve-currency U.S. dollar is the intermediary for nearly all other cross-border payments, which means a huge chunk of the world’s transactions pass through U.S. correspondent banks whose headquarters are typically in New York. In a clear expression of the geography of financial power, that gives the state’s New York City-based enforcement agents outsized power worldwide. Witness the crypto community’s obsession with the New York Department of Financial Services’ “Bitlicense.” No other state or provincial regulators command that kind of attention anywhere else in the world.      Together, Washington and New York leverage the banks’ gatekeeper role to police the world’s transactions and project U.S. power. It allows them to impose sanctions on foreign entities doing business with U.S.-sanctioned states such as Cuba, Venezuela and Iran, even when those entities have no business of their own in the U.S.      There is very little political will to end this nexus of power between U.S. regulators and New York’s banks. So inefficient, costly, and restrictive banking intermediaries will hang onto their privileged position for some time, while the rest of us pay them fees that we’d be better off applying to real-world expenses.      Yet, just as the telcos eventually lost their gatekeeper status in telephony, so will the banks inevitably lose their stranglehold on finance.      Various factors could bring this about. The rise of China’s and other countries’ central bank digital currencies will create new avenues for foreigners to bypass dollars in their international transactions. The rising popularity of bitcoin and stablecoins for payments in dollar-starved developing economies during COVID-19 will limit U.S. banks’ capacity to control money flows there. And a surging gold price hints at waning confidence in U.S. financial leadership overall as the Federal Reserve continues unprecedented money issuance.      Meanwhile, the experimentation with new crypto-based mechanisms for moving money around the world is exploding, whether in the Lightning Network, new algorithmic “crypto-dollarization” plays, or in decentralized finance (DeFi).      Here’s the thing: Money is information. It’s just that it’s a special type of information requiring trust if it is to be exchanged meaningfully.      So as cryptocurrency decentralizes trust on the internet, money will also detach itself from geography.    American Dream, bifurcated – in four charts    Reading a Wall Street Journal article on the challenges faced by poorer U.S. households during the COVID-19 pandemic, a chart based on work by Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach of Northwestern University, jumped out at me. I’ve pasted it below. The pandemic has spurred a sharp jump in the number of households reporting that they sometimes or often don’t have enough to eat, and that it’s especially pronounced for households with children. Strikingly, these trends are occurring as the stock market reaches record highs. What a statement on how divided U.S. society has become in this era.      As Money Reimagined and many others have written, the stock market surge during a period of mass unemployment is a function of the easy monetary policy enjoyed by the financial sector. So, to emphasize the disparity in U.S. economic fortunes, let’s juxtapose that household hunger chart with one an illustration of what the Federal Reserve has been doing. Here’s the latest on the Fed’s balance sheet – a measure of how much new money it has pumped into markets in return for bonds and other assets. Per the St. Louis Fed’s FRED database, we’ve matched it to the time frame in the WSJ chart:      The Fed, according to its mandate, is focused on inflation. If it gets too high, the central bank will eventually have to start selling those assets to suck up all the excess liquidity it has pumped into the market (though the latest change in policy suggests it will wait a bit longer than previously intended before doing that.) Right now, inflation is not only benign but below trend, as seen in the Fed’s preferred metric, which takes the consumer price index and extracts volatile food and energy prices to create a smoother measure of ongoing trends. (For this chart we asked FRED for a shorter time frame, starting in early 2018, to more clearly reveal the dip in the CPI.)      But there’s a disjuncture here, no? If the Americans who’ve lost their jobs in the pandemic are struggling to put food on the table, surely we need to look at how much food itself costs. This is where the inequity really gets stark. Here’s what FRED says was the CPI for “food at home” over the same period.      Together, these four charts paint a picture of American policy-making gone wrong. Could there be a bigger measure of a society’s failure than a near-tripling in the proportion of children facing malnutrition at a time when financial asset holders have never owned more wealth?      And in case you’re wondering whether the distribution of federal funds (via the Fed or national government) can make a difference, there’s some telling details in the U.S. Census Bureau’s weekly household survey that Whitmore Schanzenbach used to construct her time series on hunger. In just one of the weeks in the bureau’s surveys running from early May through mid-July, there was a sharp interim dip in the number of households reporting insufficient food – down to normal, pre-COVID levels. No prizes for guessing that it was the week after the first round of $1,200 stimulus checks were mailed out by the federal government, a check for which most well-to-do beneficiaries of the Fed-fueled stock market surge should not have been eligible.    The global town hall    BITCOIN’S AFRICA MOMENT. The story of bitcoin adoption in Africa this year keeps getting more interesting. This week, Reuters pushed out a well-syndicated story on the rapidly growing adoption on the continent, citing data from Chainalysis that showed a 55% jump in transfers to and from Africa of under $10,000 and a similarly sized increase in the number of transfers. Together, the data offer an interesting insight: The driver behind Africa’s bitcoin awakening lies in small transactions and payments. It’s the other end of the spectrum from the “digital gold” narrative that dominates the more speculation-driven activity in the developed economies, where concerns about future inflation and the threat to the existing dollar-based financial system are cited as motivators for investments, not payments. The question is how efficiently these smaller-value crypto transfers are taking place, given the state of bitcoin transaction fees now and in the future? Is the rollout of off-chain Lightning Network-based solutions helping make transactions more affordable? Or are Africans just recognizing that, amid a shortage of dollars and highly volatile local currency rates, bitcoin transaction fees are a price worth paying? The answer matters because advocates for bitcoin for developing world payments will continue to confront high on-chain costs as activity on the network grows.      HOW TO OWN (ONLY) THE MONA LISA’S SMILE. As discussed in previous editions of Money Reimagined, periods of monetary extravagance, like the current one, often result in a run-up in fine art prices. With nowhere else to go as yields keep shrinking, the excess dollars go toward things of proven scarcity, value and tax benefits. The art market hits all three.      For centuries, though, the high-end art market was only an option for the super wealthy. Now, in an age where Robinhood day traders are a key part of the stock market frenzy, a similar retail-driven surge is happening in the ownership of art and luxury assets. So says this Bloomberg article on the startups doing a surging business selling people fractional ownership of Warhol paintings and racehorses with just a few thousand dollars invested.      What’s not mentioned is that at least two of the startups involved, Masterworks and Acquicent, use blockchain technology to create the fractional ownership securities they sell to investors. It’s a booming blockchain use case that no one seems to realize is a booming blockchain use case. Perhaps that just speaks to how far we’ve come from the ICO boom days when the Long Island Iced Tea company added the word “Blockchain” to its name to get a surge in its stock price. Now, firms are pushing the technology into the background of their marketing efforts.      For these kinds of products at least, that’s as it should be. Blockchain is just the back-end architecture piece. Companies don’t talk about their websites or apps as “TCP/IP sites” or “HTTP apps.” The less the consumer knows about how the sausage is made the better.      BIKERS BEWARE. Last week a report was released by four economists finding the 466,000 attendees at last month’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota were responsible for the spread of 266,796 cases of COVID-19. It’s a tally worth 19% of all cases at that time and which, by the economists’ estimates, would have cost the public $12.2 billion in health-care costs. Not surprisingly, the story, which was ripe for “told you so” responses, went viral among more liberal-minded social media participants. But it also got some inevitable blowback. The Wall Street Journal complained that bikers were being blamed for irresponsible behavior while Black Lives Matters protesters were getting a free pass. And with Slate finding holes in the assumptions the economists used for their calculations, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem called the report a “fiction” based on “back of the napkin math.”      It’s interesting to think about what could have been achieved if the researchers could take their work to further technological extremes. The economists used anonymized cell phone data to track the movements of out-of-stake Sturgis attendees back to their homes and then drew conclusions about their role in case surges that happened to appear in their home counties following their return. But there are just too many other unaccounted variables that potentially contributed to those gains and the numbers are just far too big to make the model seem realistic.      Even so, just imagine if access to that cell phone data were extended into the kind of per-person contact-tracing efforts many are calling for. What could we learn about the dynamics of “super spreader” events and how might it help schools and businesses find the right balance as they endeavor to reopen this fall? To get there, especially with a community of fiercely “pro-freedom” anti-maskers such as those at Sturgis, we’re going to need privacy-protecting software. Alas, despite numerous startups developing blockchain-based apps to help that pro-privacy contact-tracing effort, we are no closer to seeing such solutions in the wild.    Relevant reads    DeFi Is Hot but Retail Interest Nowhere Close to ICO Frenzy.For those of us who lived (and survived) the boom-bust mania of the 2017 ICO boom, much of what’s currently happening in decentralized finance (DeFi) seems familiar. But after taking a look at the data, CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole is here to tell us that the kinds of mom & pop investors who jumped on the ICO bandwagon are not to be found this time, at least not in the same numbers. I think that’s a good thing. The fewer mainstreamers who can lose their shirts, the better DeFi can function as a kind of living lab for financial innovation.      First Mover: SushiSwap's Billion-Dollar 'Rug Pull' Is Thriller to Crypto Geeks.There is a key parallel with DeFi and ICOs that investors must be cognizant of, however. That is DeFi founders – helped by anonymity – similarly hold the potential to run off with their investors’ pumped-up winnings. That’s what DeFi protocol SushiSwap’s pseudonymous founder Chef Nomi did when they sold all their SUSHI tokens and triggered a 73% plunge in their price. Here, the First Mover team breaks the saga down for you.      CoinDesk 20 Update: OXT Is In, BAT Is Out. The CoinDesk 20 is now three months old.

According to a press statement emailed to CoinDesk, Wave Financial purchased the whiskey from the Wilderness Trail Distillery of Danville, Ky., and plans to tokenize the holding in a year or two.      Gold, cryptocurrency and real assets such as spirits have become favored alternative investments, according to the company. By tokenizing barrels of whiskey, in this case, investors gain exposure to, and benefit from, price appreciation of that asset.

The pseudonymous individual transferred the 38,000 ETH back to the original developer fund wallet soon before 16:00 UTC today, according to Etherscan.  Nomi announced the decision in a tweet, saying whatever reward he deserves for creating the project would be decided by the community:  The SushiSwap creator suddenly sold the tokens last weekend, prompting a 73% crash in the price of the SUSHI token and creating a massive backlash from the project's supporters and accusations of an exit scam.  This ultimately led to Nomi transferring ownership of the project to FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  SushiSwap co-founder 0xMaki said he was disappointed in the liquidation, according to an interview with CoinDesk China.  Following the news that the $14 million in ether had been returned, the price of SUSHI soared from $2.26 to $2.70, a rise of 16%.

Top shelf    Patent posse Square, the bitcoin-friendly payments company, is building an “alliance” to pool crypto patents and preserve the industry’s open-source spirit. The non-profit Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) aims to stop companies from locking up useful technologies in patents, a practice Square says hamstrings innovation and stifles crypto adoption. Members must pledge to make their patents freely available to all other members using a shared library.      DeFi attraction Binance is connecting its decentralized Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to its centralized exchange (CeFi) and pumping $100 million into decentralized finance (DeFi) projects built on BSC. This “bridge” between DeFi and CeFi will essentially offer DeFi access to Binance users who don’t want to leave the exchange, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reports.      Euro CBDC European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said Europe has fallen behind in the digital currency (CBDC) race. Speaking at a Deutsche Bundesbank’s conference, Lagarde said a digital euro would allow the bloc to be at the cutting edge of innovation, but the lack of payments integration in Europe indicated that foreign providers have taken the lead. Separately, France’s central bank governor said a public/private partnership would be the best way to issue a CBDC to retail users.      Uniswap volumes Uniswap topped August’s record high trading volume in the first 10 days of September, reaching $6,729,691,041 mid-morning on Thursday, leaving almost three weeks to push further into record territory. Last month’s $6.7 billion in traded volume was the leading decentralized exchange’s fourth consecutive all-time monthly high. Liquidity on Uniswap, however, has dropped by over 60% to $619 million since Tuesday as the popular SushiSwap project successfully migrated from Uniswap to FTX’s decentralized exchange, Serum.      Matching engine Cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp has implemented a new matching engine from Nasdaq’s technology vendor that it says greatly speeds trading. The upgrade is said to be 1,250 times faster, allowing the firm to add additional trading pairs and better manage periods of volatility.

Earlier this week MarketWatch announced 2020 as the year of the SPAC, citing 82 firms using this “backdoor” approach to public listing to raise more than $31 billion so far.      Another firm, Hong-Kong based Diginex, may become the 83rd. CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reports that this blockchain services firm could be publicly traded by Sept. 23.      SPACs, special purpose acquisition companies, are used to conduct initial public offerings (IPO) and hold that capital in trust to later be put to work to acquire other companies, giving the acquiree listed status.      Diginex, which hopes to list on Nasdaq, will merge with publicly traded 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp., a British Virgin Islands-based company, after a final shareholder vote later this month. If all goes as planned, Diginex should bypass many of the usual regulatory barriers associated with an IPO and list on Nasdaq around Sept. 23, said Diginex CEO Richard Byworth, a former investment banker.      While a number of factors, including pandemic-induced economic uncertainty and a growing awareness of the costs of traditional listings, have cut into the IPO market, crypto has its own reasons for finding alternatives.      INX is conducting an initial public offering live over the Ethereum blockchain, while Coinbase is reportedly looking into a “direct listing.”      While Diginex’s EQUOS.io is certainly not a “top-tier” exchange, going public is noticeable, DiCamillo said. The Nasdaq listing would raise its profile among investors and potential customers, said George Zarya, CEO of digital asset services firm Bequant.    Market intel    Struggles Bitcoin is struggling to gather upside traction despite repeated defense of support at $10,000. The top cryptocurrency's sell-off from the August high of $12,476 looks to have come to a halt near $10,000 over the past seven days. ""If $10,000 is breached, the cryptocurrency could drop to $8,100,"" crypto trader and analyst Josh Olszewicz tweeted earlier this week. So far, however, bitcoin's rebound has been capped around $10,500.    Tech pod    Mixnets Nym, a privacy-centric startup, will pay people in bitcoin for running its nodes. The software project’s mixnet, used to obscure metadata tracking, will now support bitcoin transactions and enable plugins for wallets and applications. One way Nym will compensate node operators is through L-BTC on the Liquid sidechain using the Blockstream Green wallet. It is also launching a reputation system, NYMPH, that lets participants keep track of which mixnodes are online and mixing data packs, even across multiple chains, CoinDesk privacy report Ben Powers said.    Op-ed    Learning from Graeber Shiv Malik, author, co-founder of Intergenerational Foundation and Head of Growth at Streamr, thinks DeFi proves we have learned nothing from the ICO-mania of years past.

Ministers from Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands told the Commission that stablecoins regulation was needed to protect consumers and preserve the bloc's monetary sovereignty from Big Tech firms, according to Reuters.  In a joint statement at the Bundesbank Conference Friday, ministers said private stablecoin providers needed to adhere to European regulation and should not be allowed to operate in the bloc if they fall below a certain standard.  Although not mentioned by the name, ministers may be referring to the Facebook-backed libra coin. Both the French and German governments have already said they were opposed to private companies launching currencies that could challenge the euro.  One such measure would mandate stablecoins all be asset-backed 1:1 with the euro and other member state currencies and that must be held in European Union-approved institutions.  Another proposal might be stablecoin providers obliged to register as a European entity.  The EU's economic chief said back in June the bloc was preparing a new cryptocurrency regime that would include tougher requirements for global stablecoin providers.  Earlier Friday, the head of the French central bank said the EU was too dependent on Big Tech. If left unchallenged, these private companies could shut out governments and central banks from having any monetary role in their own countries.  Also at the same conference, the head of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, said the EU had fallen behind digital asset development globally.

Called DeFi Swap, it allows users to seamlessly exchange or ""swap"" tokens in hosted pools and offers yield farming incentives to liquidity providers: the same as Uniswap and, more recently, by the likes of SushiSwap and Binance.  Each swap incurs a 0.3% fee – also like Uniswap. Binance Liquid Swap, which only launched last week, charges fees depending on the token and liquidity in each pool.  Crypto.com's DeFi Swap, which is built on top of Ethereum, will not be available in some nations including the U.S. or in Singapore, according to its white paper.  Crypto.com also ""reserves the option"" to siphon off up to 0.05% per swap to fund further research and development for the protocol.  DeFi Swap is decentralized protocol forked from Uniswap V2, but it offers additional yield incentives for users who stake in selected pools, as well as the firm's native CRO tokens.  DeFi Swap is one of a number of automated market maker (AMM) exchanges that have come to market in recent years.  Unlike a conventional order book, users effectively trade against a pool of assets kept liquid by token holders who deposit their assets in return for interest and a cut of transaction fees.  Crypto.com's move closely mirrors that of Binance, which recently launched a platform called Liquid Swap to offer DeFi-like products for an audience more comfortable on centralized exchanges.  Asked whether Crypto.com was taking aim at Binance, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said: ""When we think of competition we tend to look at traditional financial institutions like banks and not other crypto startups.""

42405047,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKepz,1599831387,First Mover: Ethereum Gets Unplanned Stress Test as DeFi Fever Grows,"This column has written in recent weeks about the surprising possibility that cryptocurrency markets might have become the new home for capitalism, in an environment where central banks and governments are intervening deeply in markets while picking corporate winners via emergency aid.      If anything, the ridiculousness of the recent weeks' saga involving the deliciously named startup protocol SushiSwap shows that not only are market signals alive and well in digital assets, but competition is, too.      While from the outside these markets may seem like a den of rampant speculation, the innovative mania now taking place in the fast-growing arena of decentralized finance , known as DeFi, is providing a test of just how much the 11-year-old digital-asset markets can bear.      The proving ground for most DeFi projects is Ethereum, the second-biggest blockchain, preferred by many developers for its facilitation of ""programmable money"" through ""smart contracts"" – bits of programming that stipulate conditions under which transactions occur, as well as any outputs.      The ultimate goal of these DeFi systems is to automate the functions of banks and other financial firms, making them less expensive, more efficient and maybe even fairer in their allocation of capital. Put another way, entrepreneurs are trying to make a buck by building things they hope people will use.      DeFi applications have jammed up the Ethereum blockchain, roughly quadrupling median transaction fees, known as ""gas,"" since the start of the year. But as the research firm Dapp Radar points out in a new report, the network's usage has continued to increase.      Gambling applications appear to be getting crowded out, but activity has swelled on decentralized lending platforms like Aave and automated, network-based trading systems like Uniswap and Curve. Total transaction volumes reached nearly $25 billion in August, from less than $5 billion a month earlier in the year.      ""High Ethereum gas prices have not affected the DeFi ecosystem yet,"" the publication wrote in its ""Dapp Ecosystem Report"" for August.      Nor have the elevated transaction fees sowed many doubts in the minds of investors. While prices for ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, have retreated in recent weeks, they've still nearly tripled since the start of the year, to about $367.      John Todaro, director of institutional research for the cryptocurrency-analysis firm TradeBlock, estimated this week in a report that daily fees collected on the Ethereum network have climbed to an average $5 million a day, implying an annual run rate of about $1.5 billion.      ""Users have flocked to trading DeFi tokens as they have become the hottest new sector in the space,"" Todaro wrote.      Shiv Malik, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation think tank, wrote Thursday in an op-ed for CoinDesk that a lot of the DeFi activity might just be ""token speculation"" and ""manufactured out of nothing,"" with ""no actual coffee under all that froth.""      But based on the recent data, the market appears to be working. And customers are apparently willing to pay.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin remains trapped in a narrow range of $10,000 to $10,500 for the seventh straight day with both bulls and bears unwilling to lead the price action.    Eventually, however, the range play is likely to end with a bullish breakout as the on-chain metrics continue to improve.  The cryptocurrency's hashrate rose to record highs above 140 exahashes per second earlier this week.  In addition, there is evidence of dip demand, particularly from small investors.  The number of ""wholecoiners"" or addresses holding at least 1 BTC have risen to a new life time high of 823,000 this week, according to data source Glassnode.  A move above $10,500 would imply an end of the pullback from the August high of $12,476 and signal a revival of the broader uptrend.  ""Moving forward, should price stabilize above $10,500, which coincides with the 0.618 fib, a bullish continuation can be expected,"" according to analysts at Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.

42405043,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKek5,1599829206,Diginex Going Public Is About More Than a Nasdaq Ticker Symbol,"Blockchain services firm Diginex could be a publicly traded company by Sept. 23.      The firm’s backdoor listing on Nasdaq is happening more quickly than a regular initial public offering (IPO), but the company – which is behind the EQUOS.io crypto exchange – is cautiously making sure it’s flush with capital before it lists.      Diginex CEO Richard Byworth said the firm’s public listing will give it more transparency than other exchange operators that mistreat customers with poorly structured liquidations and exorbitant fees.      “Some of these guys are offering a ridiculous 250-times levered product,” Byworth said. “At that point it’s quite easy to be able to map where liquidiations can happen if the price of bitcoin gets to that level.”      The exchange will still be relying on other private exchanges as references for pricing data on levered products, but Byworth said public filings will give non-crypto traders more confidence to enter the market.      Diginex is not the only crypto exchange company to be rushing into the public markets. INX has already launched its own initial public offering on the Ethereum blockchain, which retail and institutional investors can follow on Etherscan.      Read more: How to Watch INX’s IPO in Real Time on the Ethereum Blockchain      Hong-Kong based Diginex’s path to the Nasdaq involves plans to merge with publicly traded 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp., a British Virgin Islands-based “blank check” company, after a final shareholder vote later this month.      If all goes as planned, Diginex should bypass many of the usual regulatory barriers associated with an IPO and list on Nasdaq around Sept. 23, said Byworth, a former investment banker.      Earlier this week Diginex announced $20 million in funding from four family offices and one hedge fund in Asia and Europe. As part of the acquisition deal, 8i agreed to redeem at least $15 million to add to the private raise, giving Diginex a reserve of $35 million.      One of the firm’s private equity investors introduced the firm to a number of special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) managers before Diginex found 8i in May of last year, Byworth said.      “Obviously it did take some time for the SEC to get their heads around it,” he told CoinDesk in an interview, referring to the Securities and Exchange Commission.      Byworth said 8i expects to exceed $15 million easily. “That round goes all the way to this weekend … when we’ll know how many investors redeemed and how much cash is coming to us,” he added.      Read more: Diginex Raises $20M Ahead of SPAC Listing on Nasdaq      While Diginex’s EQUOS.io is certainly not a “top-tier” exchange, going public is noticeable; the Nasdaq listing would raise its profile among investors and potential customers, said George Zarya, CEO of digital asset services firm Bequant. (Diginex competes with Bequant, which offers crypto custody, multi-venue trading and an investment banking advisory arm based in the U.K.)      While private equity will likely continue to be the main source of funding for crypto startups, the main reason for using SPACs is the speed, and there will likely be more cases of it, Zarya said.      From now until the company lists, Diginex will be focused on making sure investors understand the company’s business model.      “This is a really important inflection point for us,” Byworth told CoinDesk, adding:    “It’s really important that we make sure investors understand the value proposition of Diginex and ways we’ve been designed to produce best outcomes for the industry.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/11/diginex-going-public-is-about-more-than-a-nasdaq-ticker-symbol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4009d4919ad366621f5a443e276d8391a7a799c1-1500x977.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Francois Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Banque de France, said in a speech Friday that a public/private partnership would be the best way to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to retail users.  His comments were made at a conference hosted by the German central bank – the same event where the head of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, said Thursday that the European Union had fallen behind on CBDC development globally.  Both France and Germany have been vociferous opponents to overseas companies, like Facebook, launching digital currencies that could compete with fiat money.  France's finance minister, Bruno le Maire, said last September his government would push to have libra banned from European soil.  While Villeroy de Galhau didn't mention Facebook by name, he said the EU was already critically dependent on Big Tech firms for payments.  Left unchallenged, he said, they could shut out governments and central banks from having any monetary role in their own countries.  Rather than compete with private companies, Villeroy de Galhau said that ""appropriate synergies"" between them and the public sector could lead to a better-designed CBDC being put into circulation one day.  This mirrors comments from the Bank of England earlier this year, which said private companies could resolve any shortcomings in the existing payments system with commercial solutions.

42405037,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKefA,1599825622,Internet 2030: The Future and How We Get There,"“Web 2.0 is broken”: It's arguably the most important thesis driving innovation across the world of crypto as entrepreneurs tout visions of a Web 3.0 that re-emphasizes the internet’s founding ideals of freedom and empowering prosperity.      In 2020, that vision has deviated from its original course in well-documented ways: the capture of web infrastructure by a handful of dominant tech giants, the rise of “surveillance capitalism,” the emergence of fake news and disinformation wars across all of society.      While the problems with the current landscape are understood, the path forward to a decentralized web is a murkier proposition full of many possibilities.      CoinDesk’s “Internet 2030” series will examine the future of the medium and what role blockchain and crypto will play in it with content and conversations on the future of the decentralized web.    Interplanetary: Filecoin Goes Live    The series, which features CoinDesk Live conversations Sept. 15-16, coincides with the planned launch window of the long-anticipated Filecoin mainnet, the native token for the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol. We’ll hear from Juan Benet and the Filecoin team about why peer-to-peer web storage infrastructure is critical to a free and decentralized future, and explore the array of use cases available.      Data storage is a fundamental component of internet plumbing, yet it is largely controlled and siloed off by several household-name tech companies. A reliable, cost-effective and decentralized storage alternative will be foundational for any transition to a true Web3 environment. Indeed, changing the way information is stored and transmitted would very well change the nature of the web itself.      With Filecoin, one of the most anticipated blockchain project launches of 2020, now going live, Benet and team are headlong in their attempt to deliver on that grand promise. Their success, or failure, will be a leading indicator of whether the Web3 vision is within reach or too little too late.    Decentralized Web: Promise or Pipe Dream?    The internet has reached a tipping point. Can blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies play a catalytic role in shepherding the web into a more fair and equitable tool for all?

42405046,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKeo1,1599821917,Bitcoin Holds Firm Above $10K but Strong Bounce Proves Elusive,"Bitcoin is struggling to gather upside traction despite repeated defense of support at $10,000.    The top cryptocurrency's sell-off from the August high of $12,476 looks to have come to a halt near $10,000 over the past seven days.  A bear failure at key levels like $10,000 often entices chart-driven buyers and can lead to notable price bounces.  So far, however, bitcoin's rebound has been capped at around $10,500.  Essentially, bitcoin is trapped in the narrow range of $10,000 to $10,500.  A range breakdown would imply a continuation of the retreat from highs above $12,400 and yield a deeper sell-off.  ""If $10,000 is breached, the cryptocurrency could drop to $8,100,"" crypto trader and analyst Josh Olszewicz tweeted earlier this week.  Alternatively, a move above $10,500 would signal an end of the price pullback and continuation of the broader uptrend.  Continued improvements in on-chain metrics favor the bullish case.  ""Robust hashrates enhance network's security and would shift bitcoin's price floor upwards,"" analysts at Stack, provider of cryptocurrency trackers and funds, said in a weekly research note.  Bitcoin's hashrate rose to record highs above 140 exahashes per second earlier this week, according to data source Glassnode.  Further, the number of ""wholecoiners"" or addresses holding at least 1 BTC has hit a record high of 823,000 this week.  The metric suggests investors aren't spooked by last week's double-digit price drop and expect the cryptocurrency to resume its broader uptrend.

42405042,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKel4,1599819518,Coinbase Effect Hits DeFi as yEarn's YFI Token Surges 10% on Pro Listing News,"A coming listing on Coinbase Pro has brought a boost to yEarn.Finance's already highly priced token.    The YFI token soared an additional $6,000 – more than half the current price of a bitcoin – on the news it will be listed on the more advanced level ""Pro"" exchange.  Coinbase announced Thursday it will begin accepting deposits for the decentralized finance (DeFi) coin on from next week.  In response, YFI tokens jumped approximately 10% from just over $29,000 to nearly $35,000 in the space of a couple of hours.  Most tokens listed on Coinbase have experienced, to varying degrees, a market increase in price, a market phenomenon called the ""Coinbase Effect.""  Today's market movement shows the Coinbase name, once closely associated with its reputation for listing very few digital assets, still carries considerable influence in the cryptocurrency market.  YFI has since tracked back slightly to $32,800 by press time.  yEarn is a decentralized investment protocol that identifies and executes various DeFi-related trading strategies using digital assets deposited by users.  Since launch in June, total value locked in yEarn has skyrocketed from $2.5 million to well over $1 billion at press time, according to its website.  Liquidity providers receive YFI tokens for providing certain tokens and give holders a say on the direction of the protocol.  Since it began circulating in mid-June, the token has moved from approximately $800 to its current valuation, making it one of the most valued tokens in the digital asset class by price.  Although the price of an individual YFI token is roughly three times that of a single bitcoin, there are only 30,000 YFIs in circulation, meaning its $983 million market cap is dwarfed by bitcoin’s $190 billion cap.  yEarn's founder, Andre Cronje, unveiled a whole new protocol this week that would allow users to borrow digital assets from a liquidity pool, using staked stablecoins as collateral.  Coinbase Pro said it will launch the yEarn order book in four phases once there's enough liquidity, and will only open up full trading once it's satisfied there's a ""healthy and orderly market.""  Excepting New York State, YFI will be available in all existing Coinbase jurisdictions. The exchange has not yet confirmed whether YFI will be listed on its retail-orientated exchange.  Coinbase listed the ""COMP"" governance token from Compound in mid-June – which in the frothy market conditions at the time contributed to its price spiking to over $350 before it corrected back to $200 just days later.

As reported by The Strait Times on Friday, Jaromel Gee Ming Li, 29, was sentenced to three years in prison and 12 strokes of the cane on Thursday.  Gee pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in a conspiracy to commit robbery with the aid of two other men, Mohd Abdul Rahman and Syed Mokhtar, both 39 years of age.  According to the report, Gee was engaged in bitcoin brokerage and organized transactions between parties seeking to buy and sell bitcoin.  Gee solicited Abdul Rahman to assist him with transactions that generally involved potential buyers of bitcoin for larger sums of cash, but in April 2018 they reportedly switched tactics to rob prospective buyers.  Hearing that Pang Joon Hau, a Malaysian man, had arrived in Singapore for a bitcoin purchase with the S$365,000 in cash, Gee directed Abdul Rahman and Mokhtar to locate the investor in his hotel and rob him on April 8.  Abdul Rahman and Mokhtar proceeded to physically assault Pang and another bitcoin investor, Teo Chern Wei, in their hotel room before running off with a backpack containing Pang's cash.  Gee was arrested on April 18, 2018. It is unclear how authorities discovered Gee's involvement in the robbery.  Abdul Rahman was arrested days after the attack and his case is still pending; Mokhtar pleaded guilty to a robbery charge on Wednesday, The Straights Times reported.  Rahman's ex-wife, Yogeshwry Raman, was also in court Thursday facing charges she'd received stolen goods such as a S$45,800 (US$33,000) Rolex watch bought with proceeds from the robbery.  In Singapore, those convicted of committing robbery between 19:00 and 07:00 local time can be jailed for up to 14 years and receive at least 12 strokes of the cane.

42405032,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKeaF,1599804000,ECB President:  Europe Has Fallen Behind in the Digital Payments Race,"A European Central Bank (ECB) panel tasked with exploring a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is set to reveal its findings in the near future, followed by a public consultation, said ECB President Christine Lagarde.      Speaking at the Deutsche Bundesbank’s conference on banking and payments in the digital world Thursday, Lagarde addressed the competition to dominate payments on a global scale and considerations for a euro-zone retail CBDC.      Lagarde said a digital euro would allow the bloc to be at the cutting edge of innovation, but the lack of payments integration in Europe indicated that foreign providers have taken the lead. Economies around the world are looking into CBDCs and the creation of digital payment ecosystems, while China has become a leader in the space.      “Europe has fallen behind in this competition,” Lagarde said.      The ECB set up a task force in early 2020 to explore what a digital euro would look like. In May, ECB Executive Board member Yves Mersch told CoinDesk the task force was specifically looking into a retail CBDC (one that could be used by the public to purchase goods and services) as opposed to a wholesale currency (that can only be used by financial institutions). Lagarde confirmed this at Thursday’s event.      “Digital wholesale money is not new, as banks have been able to access central bank money for decades. But new technology can be used to make settling financial transactions more efficient. It also opens the possibility of a retail CBDC, which would be very innovative in that it would be accessible to a wide audience,” Lagarde said.    Retail CBDCs    According to Lagarde, a digital euro would be a complement to and not a substitute for cash. Europe will continue to ensure that all its citizens have access to banknotes at all times, Lagarde said, adding that the two combined would support financial inclusion and offer consumers a choice.      The second consideration for introducing a digital euro is risk assessment, Lagarde said. In her view, if enough bank deposits are converted to digital euro, it will change the way the traditional banking sector supplies money to the economy as well as the way in which the ECB will have to implement monetary policy.      “We need to ensure that a digital euro, in the event that it is introduced, is designed in a way that contains these risks,"" Lagarde said.      Lastly, a digital euro would need to be designed to meet public demand for digital payments, without damaging private payment solutions, Lagarde added.      Read more: Brazil’s Central Bank Says Nation Might Be Ready for a Digital Currency by 2022      Lagarde said central banks inspire more trust in people compared to commercial banks, referring to a recent survey by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, and stood by a previous statement that the ECB will play an active role in the creation and issuance of a CBDC.      “It would have to embrace the respective strengths of both the Eurosystem and the private sector to ensure that the payments landscape remains competitive and innovative,” Lagarde said.      Europe still hasn’t made a decision on whether to introduce a digital euro, Lagarde said. But according to her, the findings of the task force are due soon, and the region will continue to explore the benefits, risks and operational challenges of a CBDC.       “We have a duty to play an active role in balancing the risks and benefits of innovation in payments, so that money continues to serve Europeans well,” Lagarde said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/11/ecb-president-europe-has-fallen-behind-in-the-digital-payments-race,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b54ad09fc4a41dfb1ef87c04e56f118e8a570df-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405038,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKeg9,1599796800,Former Central Bank Official: Japan Should Take a Digital Yen Seriously,"Japan is in no rush to digitize the yen but there are reasons the country should think seriously about a central bank digital currency (CBDC), said Tetsuya Inoue, formerly of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and now a chief researcher at the Nomura Research Institute. Inoue is the author of a book on a digital yen.    Inoue told CoinDesk Japan in a recent interview that because Japanese banknotes are highly trusted and there isn’t a considerable unbanked population, there is no rush to issue a digital currency.  In March 2020, BoJ Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya asserted that advanced economies like Japan have no need for a digital currency, and a CBDC will have little merit.  But in 2019, the government took initiatives to promote cashless payments across the country by offering rewards as incentives, and earlier this year Japan set up a digital currency group to research a possible CBDC.  Japan should not ignore the growing global interest in digital currencies, Inoue said, because the technology that would support such a currency would also support financial services that use the digital currency as infrastructure, creating network externalities (the increase in demand for a product or service as more people begin to use it).  Once the entire system originating from another country has a monopoly status, it is difficult to replace it, Inoue said. This plays a role in the battle for hegemony by major countries.  Even though Japan could still maintain its yen, if another country establishes a strong digital financial ecosystem Japan will have to rely on it to process domestic payments securely and efficiently, undermining the competitiveness of its own financial services, he added.  When asked about concerns around personal data usage, Inoue said there would have to be a trade-off: If people are providing their information in exchange for improved convenience and service, then the gain has to be calculated accordingly.  Governments should further promote digitalization not only for the short-term purpose of recovering economic activity, but also for the long-term stability of economic society, Inoue said.  By July 2020, BoJ had changed its tune, with an official saying research into a potential CBDC is now a “top priority.”    Read more: Bank of Japan Puts Top Economist in Charge of Digital Yen Initiative",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/11/former-central-bank-official-japan-should-take-a-digital-yen-seriously,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5e409e27666a371976010c18a0cd798f9ec39d1-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405045,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKen2,1599789924,SushiSwap Co-Founder Sees Future Users in China and on Other Blockchains,"Within a week of going online, DeFi project SushiSwap’s total value locked (TVL) surpassed $1.5 billion. At its peak, it made up almost 70% of liquidity on the decentralized exchange Uniswap. SushiSwap only took seven days to launch. This article was originally published by CoinDesk China on Tuesday.      SushiSwap co-founder 0xMaki (later referred to as Maki) once proudly said, “It took Uniswap two years to get to where it is today. It only took us seven days.”      SushiSwap’s founding team is extremely small, with only three people: Chef Nomi (later referred to as Chef), sushiswap and 0xMaki. The first two are responsible for code and product development, while the latter is responsible for growth and operations.      Last Saturday, SushisSwap co-founder Chef suddenly sold all the tokens that were supposed to be used for a development fund without notifying the community. This move sparked dissatisfaction and doubt in the community, and SUSHI’s price plummeted.      As doubts in the community continued to grow, Chef decided to transfer the Admin Keys to FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (later referred to as Sam) and left a message saying, ""I am a good person.""      After Sam took over the management key, he and Maki organized the code migration and multi-signature validator voting.      SushiSwap has since completed migrating its users’ funds from Uniswap and turned control over to nine well respected users who can approve changes and expenditures as a group.      Earlier this week, CoinDesk China published an exclusive interview with Maki, the only remaining SushiSwap founding team member. The interview, which is slightly edited, covers Maki's opinions on Chef's sale of the development funds and Sam's management authority, as well as SushiSwap’s development plan after Chef's departure.      CoinDesk China: Let’s start with a self-introduction. Who are you, and what do you do in SushiSwap?      Maki: I’m a full-stack engineer, but in SushiSwap I’m responsible for growth and operations. For the time being, I don’t want to disclose too much about my real identity. If it becomes necessary later, I will disclose it, now it is too early.      CoinDesk China: In your opinion, why did SushiSwap explode online?      Maki: On the first day we went online, we had the Quantstamp audit report, which contained no major defects. The security audit report is very helpful to the growth of our TVL.      CoinDesk China: What are your short-term goals?      Maki: Our short-term goal is to successfully complete the migration, this is very important. [Note: The migration was completed on Wednesday].      Later we will discuss governance with the community, in order to make the project develop smoothly and not fail.      We will also optimize the user interface (UI) of SushiSwap, such as launching a Chinese UI, introducing more traders, and adding features that UniSwap does not have.      More important, we will start integrating with other DeFi protocols. For example, the integration with renBTC’s native system, which would allow users to directly convert BTC to renBTC on SushiSwap. Another example is that if we integrate with 1inch, they can route more transactions to us because we have better liquidity.      I am a believer in Ethereum, but I am open-minded about other public chains as well. I also hope to launch SushiSwap on public chains like Polkadot and Solana.      We want to create the best, most user-friendly DEX.      CoinDesk China: When did you first start learning about cryptocurrency and blockchain?      Maki: As early as 2013, someone introduced me to Bitcoin.      CoinDesk China: Why did you decide to join SushiSwap?      Maki: After reading a SushiSwap article on Medium, I felt that ""Community Uniswap"" is an indispensable part of the DEX ecosystem, so I contacted Chef and expressed my willingness to join.      When I joined, staking, migration and governance contracts were all ready. Chef did not give me GitHub permissions, so I started directly preparing to work on market and operations.      My work at SushiSwap is completely voluntary. Now I only hold ETH and YFI, I don't have SUSHI tokens, nor participate in SUSHI liquidity mining. I value the success or failure of SushiSwap more than personal gains and losses.      I have participated in YAM and YFI mining. Although I have not yet reached financial freedom, I’m not short on money.      CoinDesk China: What is your personal opinion of Uniswap?      Maki: I think Uniswap is very good. Its founder Hayden Adams is a person I really admire.      I think we will coexist with Uniswap. There definitely will be multiple players on this track. In addition to Uniswap and SushiSwap, there will be other DEXs as well.      CoinDesk China: Do you personally know Chef? Are Chef and sushiswap the same person?      Maki: I saw SushiSwap’s introduction article on Medium, and after finding it very interesting I joined its Discord group. I was the third person to join, after Chef and sushiswap. I don’t think they are the same person, but they are probably two people who know each other in real life.      CoinDesk China: Many people on the Internet are saying, Chef is actually FTX CEO Sam, is that true?      Maki: No, Sam joined later. I don’t believe Chef and Sam are the same person.      CoinDesk China: Are you disappointed by what Chef did?      Maki: Chef sold all the tokens that were supposed to be used for a development fund, which is very surprising. At the beginning, Chef said that he didn’t come to make fast money, he was thinking about the community ... I now think he’s all talk, and I am not sure of his original intention…      In the end he cashed out, but he also transferred the administrator authority to Sam, but his behavior caused the price of the SUSHI token to plummet. [Note: Chef Nomi later returned all $14 million in ETH he cashed out.]      CoinDesk China: Do you think Chef and sushiswap contributed to the project?      Maki: They just copied Uniswap and YAM’s code, I don’t think they invested a lot in this project. They were more thinking about how to make fast money, without a long-term vision.      But I still thank them for giving me an opportunity to participate in this project, though it is forked out of other projects.      I think SushiSwap could be made into a great project, so I’m willing to continue to support it. In the Ethereum community, I’ve also met a lot of great people, they have always encouraged me and we will continue to build this project together.      CoinDesk China: After Sam took over management authority, what was the division of labor between you and Sam?      Maki: Later I will ""guide"" the development of the entire project. ... It is up to the community to make decisions, I only make suggestions.      CoinDesk China: What is your opinion of Sam’s management authority?      Maki: I am satisfied with the result. At the very beginning, Chef said he wanted to give management authority to me, but I wasn’t very confident in my own technical strength. I wasn’t sure that I would be able to make SushiSwap’s migration a success.      Later, I suggested that Chef consider giving management authority to Andrew Kang or Sam, they both have a better understanding of technology, and are also very interested in this project. Sam also holds a lot of SUSHI, so he is financially motivated to do a good job in operating and managing this project.      After the migration is completed and the multi-signature board of directors is determined, I think he will transition from the role of administrator to an ordinary community member. After that, I will mainly be responsible for leading this project to the next stage. Slowly, I will also fade out and gradually decentralize this project.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SUSHI,ASIA | ETH | SUSHI | UNI | ZRX,CoinDesk China,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/11/sushiswap-co-founder-sees-future-users-in-china-and-on-other-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73191fa33063914fae45870c004b604962f79014-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
