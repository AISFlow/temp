42429949,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2i9h,1543353454,SEC Chair Clayton: Crypto ETF Needs Exchanges 'Free From Manipulation',"Jay Clayton, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said Tuesday that he doesn't see a pathway to a cryptocurrency ETF approval until concerns over market manipulation are addressed.  ""How that [manipulation] issue gets addressed, I don't have a particular path. But it needs to be addressed"" before an ETF gets approved, Clayton remarked during CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest conference.  ""The prices retail investors are seeing are the prices they should rely on, and free from manipulation - not free from volatility, but free from manipulation,"" Clayton said during his appearance, which was moderated by investor Glenn Hutchins. Clayton also remarked that custody concerns also remain an issue ahead of any kind of ETF approval.  The SEC chairman – who clarified at the outset that he was speaking in a personal capacity, and not on the part of his agency – also honed in on the question of whether the sale of tokens during initial coin offerings (ICOs) constitute securities offerings.  ""If you finance a venture with a token offering, you should start with the assumption that it is a security,"" he remarked.  Still, Clayton conceded that in some instances, the status of a particular token isn't as clear-cut. When the topic of distributed ledger startup Ripple and the digital asset XRP was raised, Clayton said that ""some of these questions require a lot of information"" without going further into that specific topic.  On the other hand, ""many are very obvious,"" according to Clayton. ""I’m selling you my token, I’m going to go off and produce a venture and, hopefully, you’ll get a return for having purchased that token.""  Clayton also offered a bit of advice for those looking to pitch tokens to potential investors: ""If there's a gap between what you're telling [the SEC] and what you're telling people investing in your venture, that's not a good place to start.""  The SEC chairman was also asked about the recent announcement that two different crypto startups, both of which conducted ICOs, settled registration violation charges with the agency. While noting that those firms are working with the SEC, Clayton clarified that the settlements were made in the context of those specific companies.  ""People should understand that this was the remedy in this particular case but remedies in future cases may be different,"" said Clayton, adding: ""Get your act together.""  Clayton's remarks fit into the wider picture of the SEC's actions in the crypto space to date, beginning with its July 2017 release of the so-called DAO report, which outlined how some token sales, in the agency's view, could be considered securities offerings.  While some startups sought to bypass securities laws entirely by dubbing their offerings utility tokens, Clayton has noted that the token sale's behavior is how it may be classified. He used the concept of a laundry token, noting that a token used to wash clothes would not be a security.  ""But if I have a set of 10 laundry tokens and the laundromats are to be developed and those are offered to me as something I can use for the future and I’m buying them because I can sell them to next year’s incoming class, that’s a security,"" he said in April.

During his appearance at CoinDesk’s Consensus: Invest conference in New York, El-Erian said he thinks cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are commodities rather than currencies, reiterating a view he has expressed in the past.  “There were two confusions made,” El-Erian said. “People called it a currency or an asset class. What it is, is part of the commodity complex.”  “I think cryptocurrencies will exist and will become more and more widespread, but they will be part of an ecosystem,"" he went on to remark. ""They will not be dominant as a lot of the early adopters believe they will be.""  Speaking to why cryptocurrencies have appeal, El-Erian drew on the late-2000s global financial crisis that paved the way for bitcoin’s creation, highlighting the “loss of trust” in the decade since.  “Yes, we have a big trust deficit,” El-Erian remarked, going on to add:  “I don’t think we’d be up here on stage today if there had there not been a shock to the trust in the way the economy works.”  During the session, moderated by New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin, El-Erian also spoke about his view on the question of institutional investor interest in the industry, commenting that “certainly there’s a lot more interest on the institutional side.”  That focus led to a question about comments like those issued in the past by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who said in May 2018 that bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared.”  El-Erian framed remarks like that as a response to a rapidly escalating price, saying that “when people saw it was going straight up and saw who was getting sucked into this phenomenon, they started warning. And I do think those were appropriate warnings.""  El-Erian went on to reiterate his belief that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.  “I do believe this is not, you know, going to disappear.

42429958,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2iNh,1543333247,Tether Says Customers Can Once Again Deposit and Redeem Fiat,"Tether Ltd., the controversial issuer of the tether stablecoin (USDT), which aims for parity with the U.S. dollar, announced Tuesday that it would reopen account verification for new customers and enable customers to redeem tether for fiat currency directly through its platform.  ""Tether is able to return to its original vision of having a wallet for creating and redeeming directly on its own platform without having to rely on a third party,"" the company said in a post on its website. ""This update allows the immediate withdrawal of Tether to fiat (1:1), with the ability to acquire coming soon.""  Notably, withdrawals will be subject to a high minimum of $100,000 and significant fees.  Tether's white paper says that token holders are able to redeem their USDT directly for dollars, which the white paper says the company holds in bank accounts at a one-to-one ratio with outstanding USDT tokens.  Questions about Tether's access to stable banking partners – and the lack of a full audit, which the company had promised – have caused an erosion of confidence in the the token's fiat backing, leading the exchange rate to break dramatically with the dollar at one point in mid-October.  Tether is now banking with the Bahamas-based Deltec, which the company noted in Tuesday's announcement.  The direct redemptions promised in the white paper came to an end following a November 2017 security breach. However, restrictions on deposits and withdrawals had been in place since April 2017, when Wells Fargo stopped providing correspondent banking services to Tether's Taiwanese banking partners.  While transactions from the Tether website were halted following the November 2017 breach, the company encouraged buyers ""to use the services of any one of a dozen global exchanges to acquire or dispose of Tethers for either USD or other cryptocurrencies.""  Since that time, customers have been able to deposit USDT to the Bitfinex exchange – which has overlapping shareholders and management with Tether Ltd. – and withdraw fiat, although many customers have complained that they waited weeks for their money to arrive.  Some gave up and cancelled the withdrawals, transferring their USDT to another exchange, such as Kraken, which offers a USDT-USD trading pair. Following persistent complaints from customers regarding delayed withdrawals, Bitfinex announced new fees for large or frequent fiat withdrawals.  In Tuesday's announcement, Tether said that withdrawals and deposits would be subject to minimums of $100,000 and 100,000 USDT, respectively.  It also detailed fees for depositing or withdrawing fiat from the platform. Depending on the size of the withdrawal, fees range from 0.4 percent (or $1,000, if greater) to 3 percent. Customers can only withdraw fiat once per week, and higher fees will be charged for those withdrawing more than once per month.  For deposits of any size, fees are a flat 0.1 percent.  Bitfinex trading pair  Bitfinex also made an announcement related to tether on Tuesday, saying that customers would be able to trade USDT directly for dollars through a trading pair. It also announced a trading pair for euros and the euro-linked EURT.  Bitfinex called this policy ""Tether neutrality."" The policy appears to amount to allowing the rate at which USDT can be redeemed through Bitfinex to float according to market conditions.  Whereas previously the rate of exchange was locked in at $1 to 1 USDT – because the exchange only allowed deposits and withdrawals – Bitfinex will now offer direct trading pairs.  Across all major exchanges, tether's market value hit its lowest level on Kraken in mid-October, briefly trading for just $0.85.

42429948,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2i1h,1543332015,ICE Founder: 'We're Kind of Agnostic' on Bitcoin's Price,"“We’re kind of agnostic on price.”  That’s Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder, chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), speaking during a panel discussion at CoinDesk’s Consensus: Invest conference on Tuesday. Sprecher appeared with Kelly Loeffler, the CEO of Bakkt, the bitcoin futures platform backed by ICE that is gearing up for a planned launch early next year.  Sprecher was responding to a question from moderator Michael J. Casey about the recent drop in bitcoin prices (as well as those around the wider cryptocurrency market). According to Loeffler, a focus on price isn’t really a factor for Bakkt, which in August unveiled its plan to create “an open and regulated, global ecosystem for digital assets,”  ""The price is being expressed but there’s a lot of missing infrastructure and use cases,” she remarked.  The appearance by Loeffler and Sprecher – the latter of whom’s exchange operator giant is backing Bakkt – covered a range of topics, including the push to appeal to institutional investors, whether the firm is competing with crypto startup Coinbase, and the reasoning behind its announcement last week that it was pushing a previously-announced December launch window to late January.  According to Loeffler, the delay was pursued in part because ""the pipeline filled up with customers” following the August unveiling. She further positioned the move as a way to boost the chances of success by pushing the product launch past the holiday season.  As for what Bakkt is aiming to achieve – apart from the launch of futures products as well as planned initiatives with companies like Starbucks to develop payment-focused use cases – Loefller highlighted the push for price discovery to occur in markets that are regulated at the federal level.  ""If you think about commodities or equity indices, the S&P500, that price is established in a federally regulated market, we don’t have that in the crypto market today. That’s what we’re focused on bringing along with a myriad of other features."" Loeffler explained.  The panel ended on a question central to Bakkt’s launch: why it’s focusing on bitcoin initially. According to Sprecher, that’s because of the broader market’s acceptance of bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency.  “Oftentimes in finance, it’s not about being the best; it turns out about being the broadest and the most commonly accepted,” he remarked, concluding:  “And for whatever reason, bitcoin has sort of became that.”  Photo by Stan Higgins for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/27/ice-founder-were-kind-of-agnostic-on-bitcoins-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad529f0c868115fa638f050cc2c648ad8c67281e-1500x905.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42429945,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2hzh,1543330859,Bloomberg: Nasdaq Still Planning Bitcoin Futures Launch in 2019,"U.S. stock exchange operator Nasdaq is reportedly sticking with plans to launch bitcoin futures contracts early next year.  A Bloomberg report on Tuesday, citing “people familiar with the matter,” said that Nasdaq will likely still list its own bitcoin futures contracts Q1 2019, despite the weak crypto markets over the last year. It's currently working through regulatory issues with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), they added.  Back in February, the CFTC strengthened its review process for cryptocurrency futures products. Its new checklist pertaining to Designated Market Contracts and Derivatives Clearing Organizations was aimed to assist regulators as exchanges introduce new crypto products onto the market.  The Nasdaq contracts are said to be based on bitcoin’s spot price on ""numerous"" exchanges, and will be compiled by New York-based investment management firm VanEck.  Nasdaq was first revealed to be preparing to offer bitcoin futures products in November of last year.  The very first bitcoin futures contracts hit the markets almost a year ago, with offerings from CBOE and CME Group arriving as bitcoin prices peaked to their all-time high near $20,000 in December.  More recently, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) announced it is launching a physically delivered bitcoin futures product through a new exchange called Bakkt. That launch was postponed from a December 2018 launch date to January 2019 due to the “volume of interest” in the company and the “work required to get all the pieces in place,” the firm said.

42429960,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2iPh,1543327213,Harbor Launches Tokenized Equity Purchases With Real Estate Offering,"Blockchain startup Harbor has officially launched its security token compliance platform and is moving to offer digitized shares in a high-rise building located in in South Carolina.  Announced Tuesday at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest event, Harbor is now allowing investors to register to buy shares in apartment block called The Hub at Columbia, owned by the real-estate wing of DRW Holdings, Convexity Properties. There are 955 shares – represented by 955 tokens – available at a cost of $21,000 apiece.  The company, which raised $28 million earlier this year, develops ERC-20 tokens, an ethereum standard, for companies that want to put up equity or other forms of interest by way of a tokenized offering.  Harbor CEO Josh Stein told CoinDesk that the company's platform allows it to track security token trading and investors' real-world identity in real-time, ensuring that token sales are ""compliant every time, everywhere.""  Offerings on Harbor's security token platform operate similarly to a normal private placement sale, he explained. The key difference comes from the platform's use of a blockchain protocol and structure, which allow companies to tap into a wider pool of investors.  Typically, an offering like Convexity's might be sold to 10 or 20 investors, each of whom would have to contribute a significantly larger chunk of the total funding. Harbor's platform makes it easier for anywhere from 100 to 2,000 accredited investors to participate, allowing each a $21,000 minimum stake, which is smaller than the norm.  The 2,000 investor limit is a regulatory one as well – companies with a higher number of investors must go public.  How it works  An interested investor can sign up on a dedicated website, where they'll be redirected to Harbor to fill out a know-your-customer (KYC) form. The portal will require investors to share identifying information and upload a copy of a driver's license, as well as upload documents proving income and assets for accreditation, Stein said, adding:  ""The KYC happens in just a couple of minutes. The accreditation, verification of assets and income, takes … 1–3 days for an individual and 2–12 days for an entity and the reason why is you have to peel back the layers and [verify accreditation for individuals in the entity].""  Once an investor is approved, they can sign the documents purchasing the tokens electronically.  On the token side, an external security firm audits the smart contract and a ""Big Four"" accounting firm will monitor the payment flows, Stein said.  Unlike other private placement sales, investors can use bitcoin or ethereum to purchase tokens too. Harbor will escrow the cryptocurrencies without converting them unless necessary, allowing for refunds without requiring conversion fees, Stein added.  To that end, the company is working with BitGo to custody any crypto assets received.  The offering means that investors are able to participate in sales alongside major operators. In Convexity's case, its parent company DRW owns a little more than 50 percent of the interest in The Hub.  Should investors wish to trade or sell their shares, they can do so after 90 days – another departure from traditional private placement sales, which locks them in for a greater period of time. Stein said, ""You can pull your investment if you feel like it.""  He further likened the shift from traditional securities trading to the shift from writing letters to writing email. Using the internet to send messages proved to be far more efficient than writing and posting letters, he noted, saying:  ""Now blockchain, like email, offers us a world that’s faster, cheaper and easier by an order of magnitude.""

""What we’re trying to do is make key information about these various crypto assets available to anyone, whether it’s a retail investor, a regulator, an academic or a mutual fund,"" he said, adding:  ""The most important thing for us is ushering in an era where that is the standard, versus today’s standard which is driven by information asymmetry and insiders, where the last person to know about a change to [a project] is a casual observer.""  ""The key liquidity providers around the ecosystem must abide by a certain set of principles and a code of conduct [regarding] disclosures,"" Selkis said.  However, this should be carried out on an ""opt-in basis,"" he said, as crypto tokens aren’t publicly traded securities. ""So, we’re starting from the ground up and looking at what will protect consumers and what makes sense from a regulatory standpoint,"" he explained.  At launch, crypto startups Aion, Blockstack, Civic, Decent, District0x, IDEX, Mainframe, Melonport, Metronome, Ocean Protocol, Tierion and Zilliqa will appear on the registry. Another 20 companies are currently in the queue to be added, Selkis said.  In its initial stages, the Messari team will be walking projects through their applications, but the ultimate goal is to decentralize the platform. At that point, a community vote will determine whether a project is added to the registry or not. Anyone can apply to be listed on the registry by contacting the company.  Data on the registry will be publicly available, and Messari will even have an API for companies interested in utilizing the information provided.  It's worth noting that a project's assets will not be verified on the platform. In other words, while, say, the Ethereum Foundation or the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company may be verified as maintainers for ethereum and zcash, the tokens themselves will not see the same checks.

42429953,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2iFh,1543323853,Crypto Exchange Bitstamp Rolls Out Tech to Spot Market Manipulation,"Bitstamp, one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, is upgrading its tech arsenal in a bid to attract institutional investors.  The exchange announced Tuesday that it's implementing the Irisium Surveillance platform to monitor for suspicious activity and market manipulation. Following Bitstamp's recent partnership with Cinnober, a tech provider for mainstream financial markets and a partial owner of Irisium, the crypto exchange will now adopt a tool that entities such as Asia Pacific Exchange Pte Ltd (APEX) use to detect illicit behavior.  “We are committed to crypto in the long term,” Bitstamp's CEO and founder Nejc Kodric said in a statement. “Our desire is to guarantee a fair and orderly market which reflects genuine supply and demand. Exploring new frontiers in preventing market manipulation is essential for the industry to mature.”  According to the Irisium website, the company provides tools to monitor manipulative behavior and compliance with European regulatory requirements, such as the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID).  ""The system makes available the tools and analytical data to enable regulators to identify, track and investigate any trading activity"" and ""is already utilized by European regulators,"" the website says.  Alastair Goodwin, CEO of Irisium, said of the integration:  “Bitstamp’s pro-active adoption of Irisium and close partnership with us demonstrates their desire to increase transparency, integrity and confidence in the cryptocurrency market. ... Enhanced customer protection and market integrity will help drive adoption and market liquidity.”  Earlier this month, Bitstamp announced that it would be replacing its own trading engine with the TRADExpress platform created by Cinnober, a tech company providing solutions to entities like the London Metal Exchange.  This was only the first step of Bitstamp's effort to revamp its platform and make it more suitable for institutional investors, Cinnober's cryptocurrency and blockchain lead Eric Wall told CoinDesk at the time.  The next step, also in partnership with Cinnober, for Bitstamp will be to become the de facto clearinghouse for its own trades, Wall added.

Announced Tuesday, the Association for Digital Market Assets, or ADAM, is backed by founding members Galaxy Digital, Genesis Global Trading, GSR, Hudson River Trading, Paxos, Symbiont, BitOoda Technologies, BTIG, Cumberland and XBTO.  Together, the companies are pitching conduct voluntary rules to cover the areas of efficient trading, custody, clearing and digital asset settlement, with future guidelines planned to ""encourage professionalism and ethical conduct.""  To that end, ADAM plans to work with regulators with the ultimate goal of both aiding existing laws and regulations, as well as earning the trust of both financial watchdogs and policymakers.  And while the group may appear to be setting out to be a self-regulatory organization (SRO), spokesperson Seth London said it isn't aiming for that designation just yet.  ""ADAM must earn the trust of market participants and regulators before it can discuss the SRO designation with regulators and governments that have power to appoint SROs,"" he told CoinDesk in an email. He added, though:  ""The historical parallels to creation of many SROs mirrors the path that ADAM aims to follow.""  ""Currently ADAM includes a wide variety of market participants, including trading platforms, custodians, investors, asset managers, traders, liquidity providers and brokers,"" he continued. ""Its members are all firms that are active in digital asset markets or seek to participate in those markets once rules are standardized.""  In the coming weeks, ADAM intends to announce its officers and add new members. The group is also in the process of setting up organizational governance.  ""In Q1 2019, ADAM intends to convene its members, advisors and regulatory experts to begin drafting the code of conduct. That will take several months. Once the code is adopted, ADAM will exist to evolve it as necessary and monitor compliance,"" London added.  In a statement, ADAM advisory board member and former New York Stock Exchange CEO Duncan Niederauer said ""rules are fundamental to the development of any market.""  In particular, organizations that can both clarify how existing rules apply to the ecosystem and help increase trust in it are necessary for the crypto markets, he said.  The announcement comes after a group of crypto exchanges teamed up with Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to launch a new industry-focused self-regulatory organization (SRO) in August. That group, proposed back in March, notably received backing from CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz.

42429962,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2iXh,1543316469,Bitcoin Likely to Close Below Key Price Support in First Since 2015,"Bitcoin looks set to end the month below a key long-term support level for the first time in three years.  The 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), which served as a price floor for five months straight, was convincingly breached on Nov. 15. As of writing, the former support-turned-resistance is located at $5,896, while BTC is changing hands at $3,650 on Bitstamp.  The drop below the EMA support marks the resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December, meaning the path of least resistance is to the downside. So, while an oversold bounce could be seen in the short-term, a recovery all the way back to levels above the 21-month EMA is ruled out for now.  Therefore, a monthly close on Friday (UTC time) below the 21-month EMA looks like a done deal. Notably, this would be the first monthly close below the EMA support since October 2015.  Monthly chart  As seen above, the 21-month EMA restricted the downside from June to October. The persistent bear failure, however, failed to entice the bulls.  The chart also shows that BTC’s last break below the 21-month EMA witnessed in September 2014 remained valid for 13 months. If that historical data is a guide, then the cryptocurrency could stay below the resistance level for some time.  4-hour chart  The outlook for the next 24 hours remains bearish, as BTC is trapped in a falling channel on the 4-hour chart. Further, the stacking order of the 50-candle EMA below the 100-candle EMA, below the 200-candle EMA is a classic bearish indicator.  The relative strength index (RSI), though, is showing a bullish divergence. That pattern, however, would gain credence only if prices manage to clear the immediate resistance at $4,000.  View  BTC's drop below the crucial 21-month EMA support may have lessened the odds of leaving the bear market for possibly months more.  A break below Sunday's low of $3,474 would mean the recovery to $4,000 was just another dead cat bounce and prices could then drop to psychological support of $3,000.  BTC may test $4,500 (upper edge of the falling channel) in the next 24 hours if prices clear the psychological hurdle of $4,000, validating the bullish divergence of the 4-hour chart RSI.  The outlook as per the monthly chart would turn bullish above the new resistance of the 21-month EMA, currently at $5,896.

Bitpay announced Monday that it learned about the issue from a Copay GitHub reporthttps://github.com/bitpay/copay/issues/9346 indicating that a third-party JavaScript library used by the apps had been modified to load malicious code.  The malware was deployed on versions 5.0.2 through 5.1.0 of its Copay and BitPay wallet apps, and could potentially be used to capture private keys to steal bitcoin and bitcoin cash.  BitPay said:  “However, the BitPay app was not vulnerable to the malicious code. We are still investigating whether this code vulnerability was ever exploited against Copay users,”  The firm is asking users to not run or open the Copay wallet if they are using versions from 5.0.2 to 5.1.0. It has now released an updated version (5.2.0) without the malicious code for all Copay and BitPay wallet users that will be available in app stores ""momentarily.""  BitPay stressed: “Users should assume that private keys on affected wallets may have been compromised, so they should move funds to new wallets (v5.2.0) immediately.”  Bitpay has also advised users to not move any funds to new wallets by importing their 12-word backup phrases, since they correspond to ""potentially compromised private keys.”  “Users should first update their affected wallets (5.0.2-5.1.0) and then send all funds from affected wallets to a brand new wallet on version 5.2.0, using the Send Max feature to initiate transactions of all funds,” it explained.  The attack appears to have been carried out by a supposed developer called Right9ctrl who took over maintenance of the NodeJS library from its author who no longer had time for the work, ZDNet reports. The social engineering attack occurred about three months ago when Right9ctrl was granted access to the repository, at which point they injected the malware.  Jackson Palmer, the creator of the dogecoin cryptocurrency, tweeted in response to the news: ""This is one of the major issues with JavaScript-based cryptocurrency wallets with heavy up-stream dependencies coming from NPM.

The bank, an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, announced Monday that it settled the Islamic, shariah-compliant bond, or sukuk, worth $500 million on the secondary market, using blockchain tech. The bond is maturing in September 2023.  On the tech side, Jibrel Network, a UAE-based fintech startup, assisted the bank with necessary blockchain tools and infrastructure to facilitate the transaction.  The bank said it is aiming to transform the sukuk market using blockchain and integrating the tech into its infrastructure to issue more digitized or ""smart"" sukuks for more efficient transactions and reduced overhead costs.  Al Hilal Bank’s CEO, Alex Coelho, said:  “We are proud to be the first bank to launch a 'Smart Blockchain Islamic Sukuk'. The advantages of using smart contracts range from safer transactions with robust Shariah compliance, to the unlocking of new opportunities.”  The bank further said that Islamic sukuks are one of the fastest growing asset classes, with $97.9 billion worth of the bonds being issued in 2017 – a 50 percent increase from 2016.  Last month, Indonesian financial firm Blossom Finance was also looking to issue Sharia-compliant bonds or sukuks on the blockchain to fund social projects.
