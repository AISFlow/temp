42394336,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc8OP,1639244599,Anonymous Crypto Donors Are Changing Philanthropy,"In 2021, crypto users were crowned the most charitable investors on the planet. To those outside of crypto that might not mean much, but after years of reading hypocritical attack pieces from the traditional financial sector it’s pretty heartwarming to see the world acknowledge that we’re more generous than our critics.  Open Twitter today and you’ll find thousands of people tweeting about their crypto donations to charities. Enter “#CryptoGivingTuesday” in the search bar and you’ll see hundreds of charities thanking crypto and NFT projects donating millions of dollars to make our world more beautiful.  Pat Duffy created The Giving Block with co-founder Alex Wilson in 2018, developing solutions that charities, universities and other nonprofits use to fundraise cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. You can donate here as part of The Giving Block’s “Bag Season.”  The crypto community understands that these donors (let’s call them Loud Crypto Donors) – with their Twitter Spaces, live streams, NFT drops and partnership announcements – are one of the most powerful forces behind the mainstream adoption of crypto, having won over millions of normies through by plastering their crypto giving initiatives all over the internet.  But these Loud Crypto Donors are only part of the picture. Behind the scenes, Private Crypto Donors are winning the quiet war for donor privacy rights in the nonprofit sector. As someone with a crypto fundraising platform, I want to tell you why this matters, a lot.  Why does donor privacy matter?  Before getting into crypto, I worked in the nonprofit sector. I learned a lot about what makes donors tick. I also learned about a magical concept called “donor stewardship,” using donor data to get donors to give bigger and more often.  If you’ve never worked for a nonprofit you wouldn’t know this, but fundraising costs nonprofits a lot of time, energy and money (and then donors get mad at this expense, calling it “overhead” ... but don’t get me started). Donor stewardship is important for nonprofits. Using data to target existing donors is easier than earning new ones, allowing them to spend less time and money fundraising.  Read more: Crypto-Philanthropy Is Here. What Will It Do? - Joe Huston  The more than 1,000 nonprofits I’ve worked with directly have appeared to use this data ethically. Most simply collect it for fear of accepting an ISIS donation unknowingly (though expecting nonprofits to catch ISIS with their donor forms is like expecting Starbucks baristas to catch stolen credit cards before Visa can).  As a result, the nonprofit industry has developed an appetite for your data, collecting it and using “wealth screening” companies (that have become some of the fastest growing companies in the sector) to compare it against growing databases and determine how much money you have.  For a nonprofit trying to fundraising efficiently, these types of services are heaven-sent, helping them grow their budgets and their impact. Today, the majority of great charities don’t accept anonymous gifts since that’s the norm. But if you’re like me, you probably don’t love the idea of the personal information you put in a donation form ending up on server farms designed to “steward” you into being more generous, even if it’s for a great cause. Furthermore, the ability to donate to charities anonymously empowers donors to support an important cause without fear of embarrassment or persecution.  Which brings us to Private Crypto Donors.  The real-world impact of donor privacy  Although interest in Crypto Philanthropy surged this year, it’s been around for years. Many of us remember the first major wave of Crypto Philanthropy during the 2017-18 bull market, with Ashton Kutcher donating crypto on “The Ellen Degeneres Show” (back when we still liked her) and a private donor created the Pineapple Fund, giving $55 million in bitcoin to 60 charities (the Pineapple Fund was our inspiration to start The Giving Block). The Private Crypto Donor behind the Pineapple Fund pushed dozens of nonprofits to accept anonymous donations for the first time, many of whom received multimillion-dollar donors that transformed their organizations.  Shortly thereafter, I discovered the importance of Private Crypto Donors first hand when an LBGTQ charity we support received its first major crypto gift. It was a lot of money, and the nonprofit was confused about why one of their largest donors wouldn’t want credit for their gift. About a week later, we received a short note from the donor’s Protonmail. He was a closeted gay man and, because he was afraid of having it tied back to him, he had never donated to an LGBTQ charity before. I’m not ashamed to admit that when we first began championing accepting gifts from Private Crypto Donors, I never considered any experience like the one this man was having. I simply felt that donors deserved the opportunity to give without being pestered with mail or putting their personal information at risk. His story was the first of many.  Read more: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity) - Dan Kuhn  Over the years, donor after donor has written to us thanking us for our anonymous option, with their stories opening our eyes to a range of human experiences that are often erased from the philanthropic experience. These Private Crypto Donors are the most passionate philanthropists I’ve had the honor of meeting, from human rights actors fighting against oppressive regimes, to women in Afghanistan who could never get a male guardian to authorize an AFN donation from their bank account (you read that correctly – most women in Afghanistan can’t have their own bank account).  Fast forward to 2021 – crypto prices have hit all-time highs, and millions of crypto investors are learning about the tax advantages of donating crypto for the first time. This has driven millions of dollars into the nonprofit sector from Private Crypto Donors, including perhaps the most famous donation in our platform’s history.  In October, a donor took our Crypto Giving Pledge anonymously before donating $3.5 million in ether (ETH) to Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The reason this donor wanted anonymity wasn’t quite as emotionally charged as other cases, but it was yet again an interesting human experience. They had made money in crypto – a lot of money – for the first time in their life. To date, they had lived a quiet life and wanted to keep it that way. They weren’t willing to risk sharing their identity with a nonprofit whose marketing team could accidentally toss their gift into their social plan and, with a tweet, change the way their friends and family treated them forever. They came to us, donated anonymously, wrote a beautiful letter about MSF that left our team in tears, then vanished.  Since 2018, we’ve shared the (de-identified) stories of these Private Crypto Donors with the nonprofits we serve. As a result, over 90% of our nonprofits leave the anonymous option on in our widget, despite the fact that any of them can turn it off at any time. Crypto is getting nonprofits into more than just blockchain – it’s getting them into privacy rights, as some of the biggest nonprofit brands are accepting anonymous donations for the first time to take advantage of the crypto trend.  Moral of the story  Though I understand the motivation of nonprofits that mandate donor information, I hope we continue to move toward the normalization of donor privacy. Though data collection is helpful in reducing a charity’s fundraising expenses, nonprofits are creating unnecessary friction by forcing everyone to do so, and boxing out a lot of good human beings who deserve the right to support a great cause without sacrificing their right to privacy.

42411868,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgiiE,1639230768,5 Ways to Earn Passive Income From NFTs,"The non-fungible token (NFT) market has grown into a major sector of the crypto industry over 2021, with the total amount spent on purchasing NFTs surpassing $12.6 billion, up from $162.4 million at the start of the year.  And while a vast majority of NFTs are created, bought and sold using Ethereum, high gas fees can make the process incredibly expensive. Data from Raribleanalytics estimates minting a single NFT on Ethereum costs around $98.69 in gas fees while minting NFT collections will put you out of pocket by $900, on average.  To make up for these costs, many investors and creators simply try to offload their NFTs on secondary marketplaces, such as OpenSea, and bank a profit. But there are a number of ways to generate an income from NFTs than selling them at a higher price than you paid or created them for.  What are NFTs?  For those unfamiliar with the concept of NFTs, think of them as tradable digital receipts stored on a publicly distributed database, called a blockchain, that everyone can see and independently verify at all times. These digital receipts contain unique information that can be used to prove who the sole owners of certain items are, whether they be tangible or intangible.  It’s worth noting, however, that NFTs do not store the digital item they represent. Instead, they simply point to the file’s location which exists somewhere else on the internet.  Because no two items represented by NFTs are ever the same, it means NFTs cannot be traded in the same way you can trade one bitcoin for another. This is why they’re called “non-fungible” tokens.  Ways to generate passive income from NFTs  Rent out NFTs  One way you can earn passive income is to rent out your NFTs, particularly those in high demand.  For instance, some card trading games allow players to borrow NFT cards to boost their chances of winning. As expected, the terms governing the deal between the two parties involved are governed by smart contracts. Therefore, NFT users usually have the freedom to set their preferred duration of the rental agreement and the lease rate for the NFT.  A leading example of a platform that allows users to rent or lend NFTs is reNFT. This allows lenders to set maximum borrowing periods and set daily rates, which currently range between 0.002 and 2 wrapped ethereum (WETH) on average.  WETH is the ERC-20 version of Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH).  NFT royalties  The underlying technology powering NFTs allows creators to set terms that impose royalty fees whenever their NFTs change hands on the secondary market. In other words, the creators can receive passive income even after selling their creations to collectors.  With this, they can earn a share of the sales price of the NFTs in question indefinitely. For example, if the royalty for a digital artwork is set at 10%, the original creator will receive 10% of the total sale price each time their artwork is resold to a new owner.  Note that creators often set these predetermined percentages while minting the NFTs. Moreover, smart contracts – self-executing computer programs that enforce contractual agreements – govern the entire process involved in distributing royalties. This means as a creator, you do not need to enforce your royalty terms or track payment manually as the process is fully automated.  Stake NFTs  One of the benefits of the marriage between NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols is the possibility of staking NFTs. Staking refers to the process of depositing, or “locking away,” digital assets into a DeFi protocol smart contract to generate a yield.  While some platforms support a wide range of NFTs, others require you to purchase native NFTs in order to earn staking token rewards (also usually denominated in the platform’s native utility token.)  Examples of platforms that facilitate NFT staking include:  Kira Network  NFTX  Splinterlands  Only1  In some cases, part of the rewards distributed to stakers is denominated in governance tokens. Such protocols empower these token holders with voting rights over the future development of their ecosystems. More often than not, it is possible to reinvest coins earned from staking NFTs into other yield generating protocols.  Provide liquidity to earn NFTs  Thanks to the ongoing integration of NFTs and DeFi infrastructures, it has become possible to provide liquidity and receive NFTs in return to establish your position in a given liquidity pool.  For example, when you provide liquidity on Uniswap V3, the automated market maker (AMM) will issue an ERC-721 token, also known as LP-NFT, that details your share of the total amount locked in the pool. Other information etched into the NFT is the token pair you deposited, the tokens’ symbols and the pool’s address.  You can sell this NFT to liquidate your position on liquidity pools quickly.  Adopt NFT-powered yield farming  Because NFTs are fast becoming a core component of AMMs, users can now farm for yields using NFT-powered products. Yield farming refers to the method of leveraging multiple DeFi protocols in order to generate the highest possible yield with the digital assets you have.  From our example above, the LP-NFT tokens issued as liquidity provider tokens on Uniswap can further be used as collateral or staked on other protocols to earn additional yields. Think of it as earning a yield on top of another yield-generating protocol. This possibility unlocks a layered income-generating model ideal for yield farmers.  Note, however, that NFTs and the underlying smart contract technology is still relatively new. As such, many of the applications providing the opportunities highlighted in this article are in their formative stage. In light of this, it is advisable to carry out due diligence and understand the risks involved before adopting any of the above-listed strategies.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/5-ways-to-earn-passive-income-from-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ba7a3f4b73c6ae9ea1bdee89a37788eff5661ca-6400x4800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The problem with most of these solutions, however, is that they&apos;re not accessible to everyday users. While at the core of their functionality is the ability to automate yield farming operations, they don&apos;t always deliver on user experience nor composability. This is the need that Spool is looking to meet. The new project has recently announced a December 13 Fair Launch using Balancer&apos;s Liquidity Bootstrapping, or LBP, via the Copper platform. The project will distribute 5% of its total supply by opening a weighted SPOOL:DAI liquidity pool that will eventually reach 50:50 over the 3-day period. This way, the SPOOL token will start at a price of 2.44 DAI. The middleware protocol enables the creation of customizable, diversified, and risk-managed DeFi portfolios that fit users&apos; risk appetites. It acts as an easy and accessible yield optimization tool that combines farming in multiple DeFi strategies via a single deposit. Likewise, the funds in these farms are dynamically rebalanced to optimize for yield and risk. This kind of solution didn&apos;t exist in the Ethereum ecosystem. The initiative for this kind of service was started by the Spool DAO. The decentralized autonomous organization consists of over 40 firms including F2Pool, Genesis Block Ventures, JRR Group, DFG, DigiStrats, CMS, Barnbridge, and Faculty Group.

42375737,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwAE1D,1639195219,McDonald’s McRib NFT Project Links to Racial Slur Recorded on Blockchain,"UPDATED (Dec. 11, 19:08 UTC): Notes that a nearly a five-hour gap between the time of the tweet and the transaction containing the offensive entry, potentially allowing someone completely unaffiliated with the project to have perpetrated the offensive transaction.  UPDATED (Dec. 12, 15:05 UTC): Includes statement from McDonald’s USA.  One of the problems with the recent phenomenon of food brands getting into NFTs is that food is actually quite different from non-fungible tokens.  If you’re a business that’s really good at nailing the economics of mass-producing hamburger meat, there’s no guarantee you’re going to have the same success peddling tokens on a blockchain.  Take McDonald’s, the fast-food megachain that announced its first collection of NFTs last month in conjunction with the return of the McRib (essentially a soupy version of a pork sandwich). The McRib is available for a limited time each year, typically starting around October or November.  In this year’s press release, the company described its ten McRib NFTs as “digital versions of the fan favorite sandwich” – something to cherish during those long summer months when the physical product isn’t on sale.  The NFT drop was also a sweepstakes; McDonald’s has been reaching out to winners on Twitter in recent weeks.  But on Friday night, a trader with the handle @ok_0S noticed that an early transaction to what appeared to be the Ethereum address associated with the official McRib NFT collection contained a racial slur, inscribed directly on the Ethereum blockchain.  CoinDesk has found numerous connections between the transaction and the NFT collection, presenting a case study for why major brands would be well served to approach this technology with caution.  In a statement to CoinDesk, a McDonald’s USA spokesperson said the following:  “This is deeply offensive language, and it has no place at McDonald’s or in association with our brand. We do not believe, and have found no evidence to suggest, that this hidden message originated from within the company or one of our partners. But as we continue to investigate, we will take appropriate action and will be carefully evaluating any future NFT programs. This bad actor is using the McDonald’s brand to promote a deplorable message that is wholly inconsistent with our values, which is unacceptable.”  Digital trail  The digital trail appeared to show that McDonald’s official Twitter account is directly linked to the Ethereum blockchain transaction containing the slur.  While it would seem that someone with foreknowledge of the account wrote and posted it prior to the creation of the NFTs, there was a nearly five-hour interval between the time of McDonald’s tweet and that first transaction. It was possible, as we show below, to work one’s way from the tweet to the contract; it’s possible that a troll completely unaffiliated with McDonald’s or the creator of the NFT found the contract and posted the offensive transaction without anyone else being the wiser.  Here’s the chain of events:  On Nov. 1, McDonald’s brand Twitter began promoting its McRib NFT contest with a link to the sweepstakes’ rules:  That rules page, in turn, links to McDonald’s verified Rarible account, which prominently features the 0x2ef743b24a915a5d6c489479865a4e98d191efac Ethereum address. This address is the creator of the McRib NFT contract.  The first of a total of 11 transactions associated with the address is a deposit of 0.000069 ETH. As a part of a transaction, Ethereum users can choose to add hexadecimal data. This data can be used to send messages, and can even be used to anonymously negotiate standoffs, as in the case of the $600 million Poly Network hack.  Read more: Poly Network Prepares for Hacker to Return Millions in Stolen Crypto  The deposit in question includes data which, when decoded, reads “ay yo n***a gibsme sum of dat mcrib.”  The sender’s address, which owns the Ethereum Name Service domain the-boss.eth, shows that they are a prolific NFT flipper and OpenSea user, and has used various decentralized finance protocols across 729 network transactions.  A McDonald’s USA spokesperson said this of the connection:  “Those who are familiar with this space will know that once the address for a crypto wallet (where NFTs are stored) is public – which McDonald’s address was before this incident occurred – anyone can initiate a transfer to that account. Those transfers can include encrypted messages that are extremely difficult to regulate or trace,” the spokesperson wrote.  In addition to the link between the McDonald’s verified Twitter account and the verified Rarible NFT account, CoinDesk found that one recipient of the NFTs associated with the address where the slur was posted, “BTCMike,” had been contacted by McDonald’s to receive the NFT:  Who wants this?  Ultimately, the link between the transaction and the NFTs appears to be conclusive. Regardless of whether the person who created the offensive contract had prior knowledge of the account, such as an employee or contractor for McDonald’s, or was a rogue agent who came upon the contract on their own, it highlights the risks involved with public companies working with blockchain, where almost anyone can post a transaction for all to see. And posts on the blockchain are forever.  Other brands have experienced high-profile flubs with their early forays into NFTs, such as the Time Magazine drop, which was exploited and saw the majority of the nearly 5,000 NFTs go to bots.  Finding this message requires some degree of technical knowledge; McDonald’s may not have the internal expertise to realize that such an event would be permanently associated with the project.  Aside from brands cavalierly wading into the space to sometimes disastrous results, it also remains unclear for whom they’re taking the risks.  Read more: Who Really Wants Corporate NFTs?  Many NFT efforts from major brands have failed to see significant traction. The McRib NFTs, for instance, have never been traded.  “While there is so much excitement and hope for emerging spaces such as crypto, it is tremendously disappointing to see the platform used in this way,” a McDonald’s USA spokesperson wrote.  -Danny Nelson contributed reporting to this story.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | ZRX | ENS,"Will Gottsegen, Andrew Thurman",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/11/mcdonalds-mcrib-nft-project-links-to-racial-slur-recorded-on-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03ca498484b03208c186544da6771f5713509c3b-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
