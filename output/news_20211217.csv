42411869,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgilX,1639782298,What Makes Bitcoin Price Go Up ... or Crash Down?,"Some analysts claim bitcoin (BTC) is impervious to shocks that affect global finance; it’s a hedge against things like inflation, they claim, and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty. Not so, says the media. There are countless news articles showing bitcoin is affected by exogenous market shocks plus other things that don’t touch conventional financial products, such as international regulation and social media.  In this piece, we’ll give you a quick rundown of the main catalysts that cause the price of bitcoin to crash or skyrocket..  Market events  Crypto often crashes in tandem with global markets. When the coronavirus pandemic throttled global markets in March 2020, bitcoin crashed with it. Within the space of a week in mid-March, bitcoin fell by 57% to lows of $3,867. Then, like the stock market, it recovered and became stronger than ever, hitting all-time highs the following year. Analysts think this was due to the excess amounts of spare time and disposable income some retail traders had during the coronavirus pandemic, plus the buoyancy of the stock market.  Bitcoin has reacted to other market shocks, too. For instance, bitcoin fell by 6.9% in late 2021 when traders feared that Evergrande, the Chinese real estate giant, was about to collapse, and again when Didi announced plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange. More broadly, it has reacted positively to inflation, rising along with the prices of consumer goods and materials.  It’s impossible to list all of the economic shocks that affect bitcoin, but there’s enough evidence to suggest that bitcoin tracks global markets to some extent.  A 2020 paper on bitcoin volatility in the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control found volatility is not influenced by “most scheduled U.S. macroeconomic news announcements” but that the waters become choppier when “forward-looking indicators, such as the consumer confidence index,” are published.  Systemic overleveraging exaggerates these shocks and contributes to volatility. Leveraging is when a trader borrows capital from the exchange to turbocharge investment potential. Instead of trading with $1,000 of your own money, for example, some exchanges previously allowed you to borrow up to 100x your initial deposit – meaning you could potentially trade with up to $100,000. Of course, borrowing that sort of money carries serious liquidation risks.  When large numbers of highly leveraged traders all bet on bitcoin’s price moving one way it creates an opportunity for other large investors (whales) to move bitcoin’s price in the other direction. Doing so triggers a cascade of liquidations, sending bitcoin’s price to crash and creating huge paper losses for leveraged long traders. The whales are then free to pick up bitcoin at a much cheaper price than before at the expense of “rekt” traders.  Finally, weekends – believe it or not – can also have a significant impact on bitcoin price volatility. Fewer traders are actively behind their computers monitoring the markets during these times, meaning there’s less resistance when prices tumble and not as much profit taking when bitcoin spikes. This can often lead to more significant price swings in both directions.  International regulation  International regulation has a serious impact on bitcoin’s price because it determines which markets can access it, where companies can set up shop and where bitcoin miners can operate. While countries like the United Kingdom, Thailand and India have shown to have direct influence on bitcoin’s price, two major markets impact bitcoin’s price the most: the U.S. and China.  Bitcoin’s crash, from close to $65,000 in April 2021 to around $35,000 by mid-June, was in large part a response to China’s crackdown on bitcoin mining. Bitcoin fell 5.5% when the Chinese government clarified in September 2021 that cryptocurrencies are illegal.  In the U.S., bitcoin responds to news from regulators and legislators. In 2021, President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill hurt bitcoin’s price because it posed difficulties to decentralized wallet companies, which would have to report tax data about their customers that they, by their nature, do not collect.  It’s not all bad. Bitcoin responds positively to good news, too. Expectations of an announcement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would green-light a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund helped the price of bitcoin climb by around $3,000 in October 2021.  Traditional finance  Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin’s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin. Moves that would send more Wall Street money into bitcoin, like major banks offering bitcoin to clients, often correlate with price rises. Traders are afraid of bad news, like a Wall Street titan slamming bitcoin.  Bitcoin has often risen when major companies announce that they have added bitcoin to their balance sheet. Bitcoin surged after companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla invested in bitcoin. Conversely, the total market capitalization of crypto fell from $2.43 trillion to $2.03 trillion after CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin for payments in May 2021, citing environmental reasons.  Traditional financial products can also have an impact on the market price of bitcoin, particularly derivative products that represent contracts that track the underlying price of BTC. As we’ve already discussed, leveraged futures trading can often fuel steep price changes, but so can other products such as crypto options. In short, crypto options give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset (in this case, bitcoin) at a certain price (known as the strike price) prior to, or on, a certain date.  When a large number of out-of-the-money (OTM) bitcoin options are due for expiry at the same time, it can sometimes impact bitcoin’s market volatility. OTM refers to when options are not profitable. For example, a call option (the right to buy the underlying asset) is considered out-of-the-money when the strike price (the agreed price to buy the underlying asset) is higher than the current market price.  Before expiry, it’s common for big investors such as market makers to hedge with the underlying asset to reduce extended losses if bitcoin swings in the opposite direction.  Social media  When tech CEOs are all over social media, the lines between traditional finance and social media influence can blur. Retail investors appear particularly sensitive to comments about bitcoin from large influencers. Bitcoin surged by more than 20% after Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio to bitcoin because it signaled to retail investors that Musk could be about to invest in bitcoin, something he later did through Tesla. This runs in parallel with the CEO’s strong influence over other assets, particularly dogecoin.  Some analysts have tried looking at social media to predict prices. In a 2021 paper, two South Korean scientists concluded that bitcoin posts are more frequent when prices are high, and less frequent when prices are low. A 2019 research paper from Indian analysts concluded that negative and positive posts are correlated with bitcoin’s price.

Most had placed the price of the digital asset at $100,000 before 2021 ran out. With the movement of the asset at that point, one could easily look at those predictions and see how it could be a possibility. However, the crypto market has proved again that there is really no telling what might happen with it. Bitcoin had ridden the wave up to $69,000 but that would prove to be the top of that rally as a crash sent the price back towards $40,000 not too long after. Now, the price of bitcoin is struggling to regain its footing above $50,000.

42411857,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgiBA,1639780832,"How to Gift Bitcoin, NFTs and Other Crypto","From a financial point of view, this would have actually been a very smart thing for granny to do. Gifting just $10 in bitcoin once a year on Christmas day for the last five years would amount to over $750 (1,500% gain) at press time – if you managed not to sell any before then.  In fact, according to recent data, bitcoin has been profitable for 96.2% of the time since it first launched in January of 2009, meaning if you gifted bitcoin to a loved one at any point over the last 12 years it will likely be worth more now than when you sent it.  With this power of capital appreciation in mind, it’s no wonder one in 10 Americans surveyed said they planned on gifting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to their families and friends this Christmas.  So how do you go about doing it?  How to give bitcoin and crypto as Christmas gifts  While dealing with cryptocurrency might seem daunting to some at first, the entire process is actually much more straightforward than you might think. The first thing you’re going to want to do is to decide which cryptocurrency you want to send. For those gifting to new crypto users, it’s advisable to stick with bitcoin or one of the leading coins since most platforms and services will support them.  For those of you looking to send less common coins from the back of the crypto catalog, it’s worth using a market capitalization ranking platform like Coingecko or Coinmarketcap. Be advised, however, these cryptocurrencies might not be available on many of the apps and exchanges listed in this guide.  Once you’ve settled on which digital asset(s) you’d like to send, you’ll need to find an exchange, brokerage or mobile app to purchase it from.  Mobile apps  For those gifting to someone who’s new to cryptocurrency, it may make sense to give them coins through mobile apps, which have a low barrier to entry and, in the case of CashApp, could be already installed on the recipient’s phone.  CashApp: CashApp is a U.S.-based mobile application that has recently launched its own bitcoin and stock gifting feature. The main difference that sets this service apart from other competitors listed below is that CashApp users aren’t required to buy bitcoin prior to sending it. They can simply send the USD-equivalent value over to the recipient. However, it seems only bitcoin is supported at this time.  Revolut: U.K.-based challenger bank, Revolut, is a mobile banking app where users can buy and send over 53 different cryptocurrencies to one another. However, Revolut users cannot send cryptocurrencies bought using Revolut’s marketplace service off-platform to non-Revolut users.  Coinbase: Coinbase boasts its own crypto gifting feature on its app, where users can send each other digital gift cards containing digital assets. All you need to do is enter the recipient’s email and Coinbase will direct them through their account sign-up process. You will need to have your own Coinbase account set up beforehand to access this service and only five cryptocurrencies are supported – bitcoin, litecoin, ether, stellar lumen and bitcoin cash.  Robinhood: Robinhood has also entered the crypto gifting market with the recent launch of its own in-house Robinhood Cryptocurrency Gifts Program (RCGP). This operates in a similar fashion to the other apps, and requires both the sender and receiver to have Robinhood accounts prior to the transaction. At this stage, the RCGP is available to all customers bar those in the states of Nevada and Hawaii.  Both PayPal and Venmo do not currently allow customers to send cryptocurrencies to other users. However, it has been stated that these services are penned to go live soon.  Crypto exchanges  Cryptocurrency exchanges are trading platforms that allow you to purchase a wide range of different cryptocurrencies using a selection of fiat currency options (U.S. dollars, U.K. pounds, euros, etc.) or other cryptocurrencies. Some exchanges are geared more towards experienced traders, while others make buying cryptocurrency much more accessible to complete novices.  Binance and FTX are both examples of popular crypto exchanges that are suitable for more advanced crypto users, or people with experience dealing with order book-based trading platforms. In order to begin using these platforms, you’ll need to create an account, fund it using a debit card, credit card or bank transfer and complete the necessary know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures.  Coinbase is an example of a leading cryptocurrency exchange that makes purchasing digital assets easy for first-time users. Following the same procedures above, users can link their bank accounts or cards to seamlessly purchase bitcoin, ethereum and a range of other popular assets. It is worth noting, however, that the selection of assets available on Coinbase is much smaller than the ones offered by Binance and FTX.  Provided the recipient already has a crypto wallet, it’s possible to send digital assets directly to them. There are two things to be mindful of when doing this:  You’ll need an amount of spare cryptocurrency to cover any transaction fees. Depending on which token you plan on sending as well as which blockchain you use and how congested it is at the time of sending, will determine the fees you pay. When withdrawing crypto from your exchange account, the platform will automatically list which options are available to you.  As mentioned above, some tokens are supported on multiple blockchains. For example, tether (USDT) can be sent as an ERC20, TRC20 or OMNI-based token. In some cases, sending the wrong token type to a certain wallet can result in a complete loss of funds, so it’s worth double-checking which tokens the recipient’s wallet supports beforehand.  Gift cards  Binance is the leading example of a platform that offers users a simplified way of sending and receiving cryptocurrency through digital gift cards. According to the website, the instructions for creating a gift card include:  Transferring crypto from your “Spot Wallet” to “Funding Wallet”.  Entering which coin you wish to send along with the amount.  Entering the recipient’s email address.  Confirming the transaction by entering your two-factor authentication code (2FA).  Once the gift card is sent, the recipient will need to redeem the gift card by entering the code provided. Again, the receiver will need to have a Binance account in order to redeem these types of crypto gifts.  How to gift NFTs  With non-fungible tokens (NFTs) becoming increasingly popular among crypto and non-crypto users, it’s quite possible you might want to spread the gift of digital collectible cats or JPEGs of smoking apes this year.  The process is similar to sending cryptocurrency from an exchange to a person’s wallet, but instead of using a crypto exchange, you’ll need to use an NFT marketplace.  If you’re planning on buying a specific NFT, you’ll need to research which NFT marketplace the unique digital item is available on because some are native to particular blockchains and their associated platforms.  If you’re simply interested in browsing a wide range of different NFTs and selecting the one you like, OpenSea is by far the most widely used NFT marketplace available today. It’s built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, meaning you’ll need to set up a compatible crypto wallet service in order to buy, sell and receive any NFTs via the platform.  MetaMask is a leading Ethereum-based crypto wallet that sits in your website browsers, such as Chrome or Firefox, and works seamlessly with all Ethereum-based services, including OpenSea. Both the sender and receiver will need to set up a compatible wallet, which you can do by following these steps.  You’ll then need to fund your wallet with one of three supported cryptocurrencies to purchase the NFT you wish to gift to someone.  Wrapped ethereum (WETH): The ERC20 version of ether.  Dai (DAI): A stablecoin built on Ethereum.  USD coin (USDC): A fiat-backed stablecoin issued by Centre Consortium; a partnership between Coinbase and Circle.  Once you’ve successfully purchased an NFT, you can send it either through the OpenSea website or from your MetaMask wallet. In OpenSea, go to your collection and select the NFT you wish to send. In the top right corner, you’ll see a present icon which says “transfer” when you hover over it. From there, simply paste the recipient’s receiving address and pay the transaction fee.  From MetaMask, click the NFT tab next to the “token” tab, locate the NFT stored in your wallet and click the “send” button at the top of the window. Finally, follow the same process stated above and your NFT will be transferred to the new address.  Depending on network congestion, fees and transaction times can vary.",POSITIVE,ETH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-gift-bitcoin-nfts-and-other-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d5fd604d16659471930f05b289124a8ddc2ca3b-1929x1447.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MicroStrategy, which makes business analytics software but whose market cap largely reflects its bitcoin holdings, owned 122,478 bitcoin as of Dec. 10, according to the company’s presentation. Those bitcoin were purchased since the third quarter of last year for roughly $3.7 billion in total, and are now worth roughly $5.8 billion.  To generate income from its bitcoin, MicroStrategy could lend some portion of it to a “trustworthy counterparty,” CEO Michael Saylor said.  The company could also put its bitcoin into some form of partnership with a big tech company or bank. “You could think of that as putting a lien on it,” Saylor explained.  MicroStrategy might also look to put a mortgage against its bitcoin, generating long-term debt under “favorable circumstances.”  Finally, MicroStrategy could develop “some kind of interesting application” for its bitcoin, said the CEO.  Saylor noted in his presentation that no formal steps had been taken on any of these potential initiatives.

42424064,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jx1h,1639777933,"Financial Stability Group Warns of Stablecoin, DeFi Risks in Annual Report","The Financial Stability Oversight Council is still waiting for the U.S. Congress to take action on cryptocurrencies, in particular stablecoins, before deciding if it needs to take action.  While FSOC punted on whether the group would take any specific crypto-related actions, the annual report published Friday highlights concerns regulators have involving stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency market. The possibility that some stablecoins might not be fully backed, or are unable to maintain a peg to the dollar or other currency, were two key issues mentioned in the report.  “The reserves of these stablecoins, however, may not be subject to rigorous audits and the quality and quantity of collateral may not, in some cases, correspond to the issuer’s claims. Likewise, stablecoins that maintain their value through algorithmic mechanisms are potentially subject to failure due to market pressures, operational failures and other risks,” the report said.  The interagency group composed of key financial regulators met Friday to discuss financial stability issues, such as climate change, proposed rulemaking, LIBOR and digital assets. FSOC was formed after 2010 to monitor potential risks to the U.S. financial system in the wake of the 2008 market crash.  According to a press release, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, Acting CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam and over half a dozen other regulators were in attendance.  “The Council will also be prepared to consider steps available to it to address risks outlined in the [President’s Working Group on Financial Markets] report on stablecoins in the event comprehensive legislation is not enacted,” the FSOC report said.  Beyond stablecoins, Friday’s report highlighted the development and potential risks from decentralized finance (DeFi) and other crypto-related activities, such as lending and trading.  The report highlighted just how far FSOC, which formed a working group on cryptocurrencies in 2018, has come, at one point arguing that crypto risk is dependent on “the structure of the assets’s consensus mechanism.”  Trading  Despite this year’s watershed developments for crypto on Wall Street, FSOC appeared unconvinced that the highly volatile asset class has become a serious “investment instrument” for traditional types. Instead, speculators appear to drive the “majority” of trades, the report said.  Indeed, the crypto market has seen its usual expected volatility, as well as a number of hacks. Rug pulls and other scams saw cumulative losses exceed $7.7 billion over the past 12 months, according to Chainalysis.  Risks from market manipulation to criminal enterprise to operational failures could shatter crypto’s veneer “and, in an extreme case, undermine confidence in the system as a whole.”  Decentralized finance (DeFi) leverage only adds fuel to the potential for a “fire sale” that could tank one coin before spiraling cross-market. The more “traditional financial institutions” plug into these crypto markets, the greater a risk this contagion could “spread to the broader financial system.”  The report also suggested that DeFi users could face losses for any number of reasons, including price volatility, “operational issues” with the platforms they use or cybersecurity issues.  The $127 billion stablecoin market carries its own “operational, settlement and liquidity” risks that may be amplified as “network effects” drive ever more users in.  The SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) might have jurisdiction over this segment of the crypto market, as well as other agencies, the report suggested.  Traders’ “confidence” in the stablecoin’s store-of-value usefulness is critical, FSOC wrote. And there’s any number of ways to undermine that confidence; “the mere prospect” of an issue might be enough to spark a self-perpetuating run.  How broadly the real-world economy might feel this fallout is dependent on the stablecoin’s prominence. Single-issuer dominance carries its own host of problems.  FSOC advised state and federal regulators to “continue” their scrutiny of the crypto market with an eye toward understanding its systemic risks.  Potential benefits  The report did discuss the potential benefits of stablecoins and other digital assets – at least, in the eyes of these technologies’ proponents. While at the moment stablecoins are “predominantly” used in trading, lending and borrowing, they could one day become a payment tool.  “Well-designed and appropriately regulated” stablecoins could allow for faster and better payments than current channels support, the report said.  “The transition to broader use of stablecoins as a means of payment could occur rapidly due to network effects or relationships between stablecoins and existing user bases or platforms,” the report said.  The way stablecoins are transferred might also boost the efficiency of payment tools, the report said.  Still, this section also noted the potential regulatory concerns around stablecoins, including the need for user confidence in the tool as a means of payment.  “Financial innovation can offer considerable benefits to consumers and providers of financial services by reducing the cost of certain financial services, increasing the convenience of payments, and potentially increasing the availability of credit. But innovation can also create new risks that need to be understood,” according to the report.  The comments on stablecoins echoed a broader theme within the report on digital assets and other risks.  “The development of digital assets and the use of associated distributed ledger technology may present the opportunity to promote innovation and further modernization of financial infrastructure … [but proper regulation is] critically important,” the report said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,"Nikhilesh De, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/17/financial-stability-group-warns-of-stablecoin-defi-risks-in-annual-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2058f15d2d9a58f976573c8fe1f6b1ec3388dbc8-7759x5225.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The brief price bounce over the past two days was limited as bitcoin (BTC) eventually dipped below $48,000, although charts suggest pullbacks could stabilize around the $46,000 support level, or the level at which buyers tend to purchase or enter into a stock.  BTC is roughly flat over the past week, compared with a 1% drop in ether (ETH), a 5% rise in Solana’s SOL token, and a 38% rise in Avalanche’s AVAX token over the same period. The wide dispersion in crypto returns this week suggests that investor appetite for risk remains strong. Typically, the overall crypto market begins to trend higher when alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) start to outperform bitcoin.  For now, several risks remain, which could weigh on crypto prices.  For example, the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council published a report on Friday warning Congress about stablecoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) risks. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on Grayscale and Bitwise spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF), which also contributed to the sour mood in crypto markets on Friday.

Bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $46,000 at press time. Earlier, the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market value slipped as low as $45,479 on the Bitstamp exchange, the lowest point since Dec. 4.  Cryptocurrency analysts said a new sense of bearishness may have crept into the market after this week’s announcement by the Federal Reserve that it will accelerate the withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Many investors say the U.S. central bank’s money printing over the past couple years has bolstered the cryptocurrency’s appeal as an inflation hedge. Thus, a faster withdrawal might put downward pressure on the price.  “The sell wall at $49,200 has muted all attempts to push higher and get the market believing again,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the digital-asset firm Eqonex, wrote Thursday in a newsletter. “Hopes and dreams of BTC north of $100,000 have been shattered.”  Just last month, bitcoin hit an all-time high at around $69,000.  According to Bloomberg News, stocks fell on Friday due to concerns that rising coronavirus cases might hit the economy again, propelled by the spread of the Omicron variant, while some tech-focused investors took profits.

42424067,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jx7h,1639777723,DeFi ‘Rug Pull’ Scams Pulled In $2.8B This Year: Chainalysis,"Crypto investors lost over $2.8 billion to “rug pulls,” a colloquial term for a type of crypto scam, in 2021, according to a report by Chainalysis. The rise in scams mirrored a general rise in cryptocurrency prices this year, the report added.  Rug pulls, the seemingly tame crypto Twitter buzzword, accounted for 37% of the over $7.7 billion in total illicit revenue from crypto scams this year, according to the report published on Thursday. In 2020, rug pulls accounted for just 1% of the under $5 billion in total illicit revenue.  Turkish crypto exchange Thodex accounted for a majority of the lost funds on the list after its founders went missing with over $2 billion in client funds in April 2021. This was followed by dogecoin-inspired AnubisDAO at $58 million, and Binance Smart Chain-based exchange Uranium Finance at $50 million.  Other names on the list ranged from funny to absurd, such as Meerkat Finance and Evolved Apes, to Polybutterfly.  Thodex was the only “centralized” rug pull on the list, with all others belonging to the decentralized finance (DeFi) category. DeFi projects rely on smart contracts for offering financial services, such as trading, lending, or borrowing, to users.  What are rug pulls anyway?  Rug pulls are unlike vanilla scams like fake giveaways or more sophisticated crypto hacks.  In the case of DeFi platforms – developers conduct seemingly legitimate work on a blockchain, such as launching a working application and carrying out social media marketing, before issuing a token and listing on a decentralized exchange (DEX).  The listing is where the scam starts: Investors purchase the scam projects’ tokens in hopes of a price increase and supply liquidity to those projects on DEXs. The liquidity is provided in the tokens of whichever blockchain that project is built on – such as ERC-20 tokens for Ethereum or SPL tokens for Solana – and can run into millions of dollars.  When the project is live for a few hours or days, liquidity pools can run into tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars. This is where a scammer strikes in and “pulls” all liquidity away from the DEXs pocketing the entire amount. The rug pull is then complete.  An important point here is that developers of such projects do not “lock” their control over the token’s liquidity pool on a DEX and are able to retract the entire pool. Locking the liquidity can be done via burning the private key used to start the liquidity pool, at which time it’s technically impossible for a rug pull to occur.  Scammers can also get creative at times. In early 2021, a Twitter account called “WarOnRugs” gained a following of nearly 100,000 on the microblogging site after auditing DeFi code and exposing the creators behind rug pull projects.  The account later raised $2 million from investors to battle the growing rug pull problem … before pulling the rug later.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/17/defi-rug-pull-scams-pulled-in-28b-this-year-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3218a1a8d0fb022869931d350267b3ab2166dfb8-1200x798.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424047,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jwZh,1639777662,Justin Sun Is Retiring From Tron – But Not Crypto,"Tron founder Justin Sun is getting political.  The polarizing crypto entrepreneur said Friday he is leaving his brainchild Tron blockchain to TRON token holders. Sun said in an interview with CoinDesk that he is moving to focus on crypto legitimization in Latin American countries – after witnessing El Salvador’s success in making bitcoin legal tender.  For now, that means becoming an ambassador of the Grenada government to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Sun detailed his personal career plans in an open letter reviewed by CoinDesk. They include giving away at least some of his power on the Tron blockchain and promoting blockchain and crypto in countries like Grenada.  “My career in the future … will focus on the legitimization of blockchain technology on a nation-state level,” Sun said in an interview Tuesday.  After watching the U.S. House Financial Services Committee grill six executives about crypto last week, Sun said that the industry cannot make an all-in bet on the U.S., given the country’s slow progress and conservative view on crypto’s legalization.  In pushing crypto adoption, Sun is especially bullish on Caribbean countries including Grenada and the Bahamas. He was visiting Panama at the time of his CoinDesk interview on Tuesday.  Why Grenada  Sun said that Grenada, for example, has several advantages for blockchain-related businesses.  The island nation recognizes English as one of its official languages and is geographically close to the U.S. It also has a strong educational system that includes one of the best universities in the region that Sun believes will be a hotbed of future blockchain developers.  If the legitimization of the blockchain industry in countries such as Grenada proves to be a success, it would also potentially persuade the U.S. and China to speed up or resume their blockchain efforts, Sun said.  In China, crypto trading and mining are banned, while in the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains obstinate in its approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  “One of the things that makes crypto risky is that consumers may not understand the difference between one token and another token,” Bitfury’s Brian Brooks said during the Congressional hearing last week. “We don’t allow that in the United States [but] we do allow it in Canada. We allow it in Germany, Singapore, Portugal and a number of other places. So if you’re a developer of those products, there’s no fuzzy line, it’s super clear. You can’t do that here. So you have to go abroad.”  Thinking globally  Sun’s decision also comes at a time when the overall crypto market is showing signs of exhaustion, with bitcoin down about 25% from November’s all-time high.  But Sun is optimistic and remains bullish on the price side, despite short-term uncertainty.  “We cannot fully rely on the U.S. market,” he said. “There are nearly 8 billion people in the world and the U.S. only has just 300 million people. The U.S. market should not decide [on crypto] with more than 7 billion people left in the rest of the world.”  In his open letter, Sun said that the Tron Foundation will dissolve by next year and three super nodes associated with him have retired from Tron’s technical grid this week. The 27 super representatives on the Tron blockchain will be elected by the Tron community.  As one of the layer 1 blockchains to power smart contracts – the foundation of today’s $247 billion decentralized finance (DeFi) sector – Tron, like other so-called Ethereum alternatives, is known for low transaction costs and faster speed. It’s the leading home of the tether (USDT) stablecoin, for example.  Sun said he will continue promoting Tron’s brand while stepping away from the day-to-day operations at the Tron Foundation. He did not address his remaining influence on Tron, as the network’s figurehead and one of its largest bag holders.  Arguably one of the most influential figures in crypto, Sun is no stranger to controversy. It will be interesting to see if it follows him into his next act.

42390144,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUthmP,1639774621,The Lifecycle of a DAO: Inside a Cultural Phenomenon,"The Discord channel was filled with anons greeting each other: “Gm.” “Good morning.” “Good morning.”  To some, it started as an innocuous way of saying “good morning.”  “IRC/Discord has been around forever and never had a culture of gm’ing each other – but with crypto – specifically post COVID – it felt like for the first time people’s job was virtual first to ‘commute’ to the computer, log into Discord, be social with each other, day trade, and build things – while saying, ‘Yes, I am present today – I may not have anything to post right now, but I’m here, working’ – particularly important for devs or mods that didn’t want to make it seem like their community was a ghost town,” states Paul, a co-initiator of the Kong community, that has adapted the phrase to a colorful image of the text “KM”, for “Kong morning.”  Kelsie Nabben is a PhD Candidate and researcher at RMIT University’s Centre for Automated Decision-Making & Society. Dr. Alexia Maddox, a research fellow at the Blockchain Innovation Hub, is a sociologist of technology, focusing on digital frontiers and online communities. This post is part of CoinDesk’s Culture Week.  He added, “When you gm someone it’s an acknowledgement that you’ve shown up for work and you’re talking to a fellow degen [decentralized finance degenerate]. From there it kind of became a meme or cultural identifier that our community does that others don’t. No one on Twitter said gm to each other before crypto.”  Others believe that it’s a way to increase visibility across multiple community chat channels. It also demonstrates engagement with algorithmic monitoring to increase the potential upside of any rewards “participation.” With “gm,” the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) comes alive.  This is just one example of the cultural dynamics of ritual that inform and form the identity of a DAO – an autonomous organization of sovereign individuals.  Approaching a DAO as a concept  A DAO is a relatively new form of politically decentralized organization whereby a network of people coordinate through software code and automation to govern themselves toward a stated objective. Autonomy here relates to an autonomy of process, building from the Ethereum blockchain’s smart contract function into a discrete living system. DAOs are testing the possibilities of decentralized self-governance and possess governance patterns which are expressed in distinct phases.  To think through the cultural practices and evolution of a DAO, we present a thought experiment on the lifecycle of a DAO, from birth, life, procreation and death to resurrection. We unpack how such amorphous and multi-layered collective endeavors emerge and the way their identities form and transform through ritualistic rights of passage.  Sorting through the numerous ways DAOs have been described – as organizations, virtual entities, networks of participants, colonies or “magic internet communities” – we seek to explore them as living systems of human and non-human actors. To do this, we draw on the cybernetic logic of autopoiesis – the ability of a living thing to “maintain and renew itself by regulating its composition and conserving its boundaries.” We are not anthropomorphizing technology (casting technology in our image and story). Instead, we are highlighting the cultural nexus that arises through human-technology encounters.  So, what is a DAO, really? Fundamentally, DAOs are a coordination infrastructure.  A DAO is about people and an objective; it uses machine systems to enhance people’s capacity for self-governance. Thus, a DAO can be many things, from a small collective of hobbyists to a massively scaled, multimillion-dollar organization.  Most commonly, DAOs are built upon constituent blockchain-based parts that include a treasury, governance mechanisms such as (but not exclusively) voting, smart contracts for the execution of decisions, tokens as a way for people to buy or be “airdropped” into a collective endeavor, and ways to facilitate collective processes that supplant traditional organizational formats. They also integrate real-world feedback loops to ingest and process information from the outside world; for example, data oracles that translate real-time data feeds from external sources to support the DAOs decision-making and execution capabilities.  When we think about all the moving parts of a DAO, we suggest that a process of identity construction occurs for both human and non-human actors, within the system and at scale for the DAO itself. For the identity of a DAO to evolve, it must pass through and cross a threshold moment. As the DAO moves through each threshold moment, from birth to death to possible resurrection, different pathways of action potential open up within the network. Hence these moments hold the ritualistic hallmarks of rites of passage. These rites of passage are culturally continuous events that connect the individual actor with the collective endeavor over time.  We now turn to the application of these ideas of the cultural contexts for identity (trans)formation of DAOs to trace the lifecycle of a DAO.  The lifecycle of a DAO  DAOs are alive. They each have a unique purpose, shared language among constituents, cultural values and creative capacity. Thinking of DAOs as a living system allows for exploration of the co-constructive and interdependent relationship between people and code, and autonomous from external direction of goals.  The evolutionary nature of these assemblages and how they adapt and transform in response to stimuli provides insights into the lifecycle of a DAO, from birth, to death, to procreation and resurrection.  Birth  DAOs are taking two main routes to becoming a DAO.  The first is the “DAOFirst” approach, whereby a team determines capital allocation and token allocation rules at the outset, such as Kain Warwick and DeFi DAO “Synthetix.”  The second is the “exit to DAO” approach, where a project with an established community transitions into a DAO by handing over control of key functions to the community and fundamental settings around capital allocation and token allocation are iteratively determined. This approach is demonstrated in Gitcoin, a public funding mechanism in the Ethereum community that transitioned from a project to a DAO by “retroactively” airdropping tokens to prior users, who became “the new bosses.” With resources and participants, the DAO is born.  Life  The life of a DAO is in the interplay and relations between people and code, as they simultaneously consume and subsume.  In existing algorithmic entities, what is consumed is capital, labor and infrastructure. The resources that a DAO needs to stay alive are similar, including liquidity, participants, and contributions to and maintenance of the open-source code base.  “We envision many thousands of people cooperating on shared goals … But DAO operation requires a decentralized, resilient and scalable governance system,” states Matan Field, co-founder of DAOstack. Yet, the DAO also subsumes these resources of attention, capital, labor and infrastructure, and in return provides incentives and rewards, including digital tokens, knowledge and growth.  A DAO however is not a static point-in-time collective endeavor. DAOs are evolutionary institutions.  An example of a DAO decentralizing the fundamental precepts of content generation is Mirror. Mirror is a “Media DAO” that brings readers and authors into a direct content discovery/publishing relationship. Write tokens are issued to new members who then use these to vote on author pitch proposals. Authors who have their pitches selected to progress through the voting process automatically receive the pledged write tokens to fund their writing.  As some participants have found, “Write club is brutal. My fate will be decided in a two hour voting window …” This simple concept is intended to remove a vast publishing infrastructure that currently mediates and consumes the reader/content/author relationship. Not content to stop there, pardon the pun, Mirror is introducing a multitude of Web 3 native tools that support crowdfunding, non-fungible token (NFT) editions and auctions. Through these actions and functionality, existing members are intended to have both a cultural and economic stake in who is contributing.  As Mirror demonstrates, it is constantly evolving in the types of direct action it makes possible and is fundamentally dependent on people to engage through it, maintain it, own it and develop it. While you might say that it embeds the disparate parts of publishing within one (decentralized) system, all the automation in the world will not keep it alive. A DAO needs buy-in.  Procreation  DAOs don’t just live, they procreate. As Michael Zargham, founder and CEO at Blockscience systems engineering firm and participant in numerous DAOs, points out, DAOs initiate other DAOs to fulfill sub-functions. An example of a “pluralistic autopoietic organization” in the form of a DAO is 1Hive. 1Hive exists to create and implement tools for decentralized, self-governance. To do this, the DAO spins off smaller, self-governing working groups by funding them with their own budget and funding to fulfill specific functions in line with the broader objectives of the DAO.  To effectively create and procreate, DAOs are composed of a suite of technologies and functions to do this, such as community covenants, governance processes such as forum deliberation, governance mechanisms such as voting, funds, reputation, recognition, reward, and internal arbitration mechanisms such as decentralized courts.  Death  DAOs can also die. With the volume of DAOs emerging and competing for informed and educated attention and expertise, some DAOs may struggle to stay alive. Scholar Ellie Rennie argues that participatory blockchain machines die when enough people cease to participate. Zargham points out that just like “zombie chains,” when a blockchain protocol no longer has participants funding or maintaining its infrastructure, there can also be “Zombie DAOs.” What dies in a DAO is collective vision and the energy of a community in pursuit of this vision.  This is not necessarily negative. DAOs exist to fulfill a purpose. Sometimes, they only need to exist for a finite amount of time. Other times, DAOs fail and die, yet they can also evolve and re-emerge in new manifestations for the same goals.  Resurrection  A DAO must be participatory to be considered “alive.” Life can be breathed back into a DAO through capital and code contribution. Reinvigorating contributions to these aspects of a DAO can reinvigorate or re-engineer the core objectives of a DAO and re-establish culture and participation. Sometimes, even though a DAO dies, its goals and community evolve and persist. In these cases, the institutional form can evolve but the community can return to participate as an entirely new organization, with the same stated, shared purpose.  For example, the goal of public goods funding in the Ethereum community has gone through several iterations, and it is still evolving beyond its current form. DAOs can be ad hoc, ephemeral coalitions for temporary missions; long-term institutions; or loose cohorts that coordinate toward goals, through evolutions in institutional forms.  This modular approach to governance is beginning to be expressed in various DAO communities. For example, DAOs are starting to play with multi-layered approaches to sub-DAOs, which operate for various functions across different time scales.  Identity of a DAO  There are both the visible, and often less-visible, cultural spaces and rituals that mark a DAO’s unique identity, its (trans)formations and changing pathways of action. These threshold moments of birth, life, procreation, death and resurrection signal a living cybernetic organism with a technological nervous system.  The lifecycle approach illustrates the evolving balance and trade-offs in an “autonomous” organization between people, machines and algorithms in designing, enacting and acting through DAOs. A DAO, as an entity with a unique identity formed out of distinct cultural experiences and rituals, can act upon the world in a self-determined way and, in doing so, change it. DAOs breathe life by materializing their actions in the physical as well as the informational realms.  So every time you say “gm,” the DAO says “gm” back.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Kelsie Nabben, Alexia Maddox",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/17/the-lifecycle-of-a-dao-inside-a-cultural-phenomenon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c1305d2ab5a7775b8c058e7ea37a219519a2154-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Paraguay’s Chamber of Deputies will discuss the bill in 2022, as confirmed on Twitter by Paraguayan Sen. Fernando Silva Facetti, one of the three authors of the measure.  Miners – either individuals or companies – will need to request authorization for industrial electricity consumption and then apply for a license, the bill notes.  Paraguay’s Industry and Commerce Secretariat will enable and supervise crypto mining within the country, according to the bill, with the country’s National Securities Commission, Anti-Money Laundering Office and National Electricity Administration also regulating the activity.  Although the concept of exchange is not included, the bill also proposes a registry for any individual or legal entity seeking to provide crypto trading or custody services for third parties.  According to the bill, Paraguay consumes only a third of its energy producted and, if regulated, crypto mining activity could reach “the electricity consumption of thousands of megawatts that Paraguay currently has as surplus.”  One of the main attractions for mining companies is the cost of electricity in Paraguay, which is the lowest in the region at around $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, Paraguayan congressman Carlos Rejala told CoinDesk in June, adding that almost 100% of energy production comes from hydroelectric sources.

42407253,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUKXN8,1639766030,How NFTs Put Generative Artists on the Map,"“Did I make over a million dollars this year? Yes I did.”  Joshua Davis is among hundreds, maybe thousands, of creators who have made life-changing amounts of money from the non-fungible token (NFT) boom. But he didn’t make his mil selling profile jpegs of zombie gophers wearing polo shirts.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s Culture Week.  Davis founded Praystation.com in 1995 to display his art, part of a new wave of creativity then being unleashed by home computers and the World Wide Web. His works, at first composed largely using the Flash animation tool, consist of code that produces dozens, even hundreds, of related images by repeating a set of rendering commands, with randomly changing variables for features like color and line length.  The images are abstract, noisy, sometimes unnerving. Davis’ work made him a respected digital artist decades before the first Ape got Bored, and one of the contemporary scions of “generative art,” an artistic tradition whose roots stretch back at least as far as the 1940s. In its modern form, generative art weds computer science with biology and physics to create images, sound or video based on randomized elements and parameters. The results are often fascinating, and just as often deeply strange.  But for decades, Davis and his contemporaries struggled with a very real problem: money. Because their art was nothing more than bits, there was no individual, unique object they could sell in the way one would a painting. Artists like Davis have sold prints and books, but they largely missed out on the kind of big collector paydays that other leading fine artists enjoy. That is, until NFTs came along.  “I never thought this would happen in my lifetime,” Davis says of NFT technology and its huge benefits for generative art. “I thought the next generation maybe would find a way to find value in digital art. I never thought digital art would be embraced as something you could assign provenance, collectability and scarcity.”  While headlines have focused on the speculative, trivial, sometimes silly applications of NFTs, the technology has truly transformed Davis’ very respectable corner of the art world. They’re giving an entire artistic tradition that had been ephemeral and conceptual the chance to join the fine art market on solid footing for the first time.  What is generative art?  If you’re an NFT fan, you might have heard the term “generative art” applied to “profile pic” NFTs like those Bored Apes, whose features are randomly selected based on a “rarity” algorithm. That makes Pudgy Penguins and Wonky Whales, believe it or not, descendants of path-breaking work by some of the most important artists of the 20th century.  In my conversations with generative artists working today, one name came up again and again as a touchstone: Sol LeWitt. Starting in the late 1960s, LeWitt began producing large, geometrical wall drawings, not by drawing them himself but by writing detailed instructions that could be executed by anyone. Galleries still regularly present the works as interactive collaborations, with viewers themselves doing the drawing.  Joshua Davis says his “aha” moment as an artist was realizing the same logic could be applied more generally. “When an artist walks in front of a blank canvas, there are decisions that are made – the colors I use, the brush, the canvas, the kind of strokes I’m going to make … I could look at [Jackson] Pollock or [Jean-Michel] Basquiat – here are the kinds of strokes, the actions. Those actions, I could program.”     Other mid-century artists helped lay the foundations for generative art by taking cues from then-emerging computer technology. The Hungarian-French designer Victor Vasarely crafted rigid grids and 3D illusions that predated computer graphics by as much as half a century. The Dutch designer Karel Martens produced dozens of iterative sets of overlapping shapes. Among the first artists to actually apply a computer to art making was Grace Hertlien, who said other artists called her a “whore” and a “traitor” for using computational processes in art.  Other prominent creatives were exploring ideas of procedure and randomness alongside these visual pioneers. Starting in the mid-1940s, composer John Cage and choreographer Merce Cunningham began using “chance operations” such as flipping a coin to determine the length of a note. In the 1950s, the painter Brion Gysin and novelist William Burroughs developed the “cut up” method of generative writing, which produced new work by cutting up existing text and randomly rearranging it. (Burroughs was also strangely connected to early computing, as the heir of an adding machine empire).  These pathways represent the two big ideas being explored in generative art: chance and systems design. John Cage often subtracted his own intention from his work as a challenge to the romantic notion of artistic genius, as with his infamous “4:33″ – a composition made up, not of music, but of the random noises in a concert hall for four minutes and 33 seconds. Rather than seeking the precision and control of a Beethoven or Rubens, generative artists express themselves through the parameters of randomized systems.  “I think there’s something really beautiful to thinking about systems,” says Zach Lieberman, a veteran generative artist who teaches at the MIT Media Lab, co-founded the School for Poetic Computation, and has collaborated with author Margaret Atwood. “We can ask really complicated graphical questions, and by manipulating those parameters we can see, where does this parameter space take us … between 0.1 and 0.01, the difference can be really dramatic. I think there’s something really special in that.”  The digital explosion  These early analog works were ripe for expansion once personal computers put programming and graphical tools in the hands of the masses. As Davis recounts it, some of the most influential generative art of the 1980s and 1990s came not from galleries, but from hackers peddling stolen software.  “You would get cracked software,” says Davis, “And they’d include a [graphical] demo reel from the team that cracked it, and the goal was to do the most visually robust scene in the smallest number of bytes.” This was the era of dial-up internet, so the name of the game was to generate rich visuals, from flyovers of verdant landscapes to complex abstract shapes, from tiny blocks of hyper-efficient code running on the downloader’s machine.  “They’d be, like, 4 kilobytes,” says Davis. “Mind boggling.” As we’ll see, that focus on efficient coding has found new relevance with the arrival of NFTs.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s Culture Week.  Though the arrival of the internet and home computing blew the creative doors open on generative art, artists still faced a major problem. “For years we’ve really struggled with, how do we sell this work?” says Zach Lieberman. “How do you sell a video, how do you sell an image? This thing that’s reproducible, it’s hard to tell how it fits in the gallery context.”  NFTs appear to have genuinely solved that problem. Generative artists even have their own dedicated NFT platform, Art Blocks, where they upload algorithms that buyers can “mint” iterations of. Art Blocks has generated hundreds of millions in sales, an immense windfall for long-suffering digital artists. A roving NFT gallery called Bright Moments, which emerged from Fred Wilson’s Union Square Ventures, mints pieces during live events, revealing iterations of work like Tyler Hobbs’ “Incomplete Control” to buyers in real time.  The technology isn’t without its critics and drawbacks, of course. Environmental concerns swirling around proof-of-work mining have impacted perception of NFTs, and Lieberman says they’ve become an issue in the art world.  “Some people say they’ll do proof-of-stake only,” he says. “And then there are people who hate this, including people I love.”  A related drawback is cost. Minting an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain can cost hundreds of dollars right now, which may be too big of an upfront investment for younger artists. According to Lieberman, many in the generative art community have turned to the Tezos blockchain for lower-cost experimentation.  NFTs beyond jpegs  As much of a breakthrough as NFTs have already been for algorithmic artists, their full potential remains to be explored.  “I’m really excited by artists who are experimenting with the fundamental form of what an NFT is,” says Lieberman. “Hacking at the layers of code.”  The starting point for that is a growing emphasis on storing everything on-chain. Many NFTs released at the height of avatar-mania were justly lampooned as nothing but links to images stored on web pages that could go down at any time. That’s a big step back from the pieces that pioneered the format, CryptoPunks, which are fully on-chain.  “I thought CryptoPunks were a brilliant example of generative art,” Art Blocks founder Erick Calderon, himself a generative artist, recently told ArtNews of his early exposure to NFTs. “Somebody wrote an algorithm that within a 24-by-24-pixel image was able to create 10,000 unique characters with a story.”  Read more: Why I Spent $29M on a Beeple - Ryan Zurrer  Artists like Deafbeef are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible for entirely on-chain generative work, working with constraints similar to those of the early 1990s demo scene. “The ideal drop on Art Blocks is between 5 and 20 kilobytes,” says Joshua Davis. “So you’re having to write the most elegant piece of code that has the most diversity in terms of color, variance, is it interactive … Being able to put code on-chain that keeps creating those moments when you go back is just tremendous.”  Other possibilities of NFT art are much weirder, and create options that artists have never really had before. For example, pieces can alter their appearance as they’re bought and sold on-chain, or through cryptocurrency interactions. The artist Rhea Myers, for instance, creates graphical works on Ethereum that users can alter by burning associated ERC-20 tokens.  Another frontier still to be explored is how to present generative art NFTs beyond your laptop screen. Davis sees interactivity as the killer app here, envisioning visitors generating art based on their own inputs through motion-tracking hardware. “I’m going to track your movement, and that becomes part of the generative art that gets preserved on-chain. You’re seeing your movements translated into some sort of artistic input, and at the end you get a video of your 45 seconds. I think we’re just at the start of what can be offered as a collectible.”  These novel tools are being discussed in a growing number of journals and podcasts dedicated to generative art. Outland is a home for thinky essays at the intersection of computation and cultural theory. Holly Herndon, one of the artists at the forefront of the movement, also co-hosts the Interdependence podcast, featuring discussions with generative and digital artists.  The existence of those platforms for exploratory pontificating also helps highlight the distinction between adventurous fine art like Lieberman’s 2020 “Future Sketches” and the more straightforward illustration and design approach behind many mainstream NFTs.  “I often think about art as [like] navigating through a new city. It feels like walking around late at night, it’s a little dark, you get lost,” says Lieberman. “The creative process is about navigating the unknown and known, or going back to familiar territory with new eyes. Design, on the other hand, always feels like a daytime activity. You have a map. You know where you’re going.”  Yes, it’s still about money  That experimental attitude may make the financial side of NFTs even more important for adventurous generative artists than for more commercially minded creators. Davis says this year’s cash infusion is going to give him time to focus on exploring the frontiers of his medium, rather than having to chase sidework to pay the bills.  But NFTs don’t just put digital artists on equal footing with traditional painters and sculptors – they actually sweeten the deal. If a painter in the traditional gallery world sells a piece for $35,000 and five years later it resells for $4 million, she doesn’t see any of that resale money. But NFTs can be designed to perpetually send revenue from secondary sales back to the artist.  “The first time my work was resold and I got 10% or whatever it was, that’s amazing,” says Lieberman. “That feeling of, oh my god, here’s this thing that happened between two other people, I was not involved and I received a percentage, that was mind-blowing. That’s never happened to me. It was a lightbulb moment.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | XTZ,David Z.

And parents are going to extreme lengths to get their hands on Magic Mixies Cauldrons, the “it” toy of this holiday season.  You’ve heard it ad nauseum: The global economy is beset with supply chain problems. These have contributed – along with central banks’ massive monetary expansion programs – to an inflation outbreak that on Wednesday led the U.S. Federal Reserve to signal a faster-than-expected curbing in monetary expansion.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In essence, global goods markets can’t respond efficiently enough to the disruptions in demand and supply to which the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed. As much as Moose Toys would love to get a Magic Mixies Cauldron into the hands of every child who wants one before Christmas, they can’t crank out or distribute them fast enough.  It’s a reminder that despite just-in-time inventory systems, an abundance of market information, highly automated factories and other advances brought by digitization, physical problems such as the availability of cargo containers, warehouses or willing workers continue to cap producers’ ability to respond quickly to market signals.  Now think about the past year for bitcoin mining. The industry also had two massive shocks to capacity in short succession – both from China – which contributed to periodic inflationary pressures in the form of higher transaction fees.  But the Bitcoin network adjusted rapidly to the changed circumstances, with the network hashrate – a measure of the total number of hash calculations conducted every second – now having fully recovered and while Bitcoin transaction fees are low and stable.  In this column we’ll examine why Bitcoin’s market adjustment mechanisms are more efficient than traditional markets.  Please don’t @ me, crypto critics. This is not a naive “Bitcoin fixes this” essay. I don’t have an answer for fixing global supply chains. I simply think it’s useful to explore how Bitcoin’s design fosters its unique adaptive capacity and how that’s pointing to new ways in which other systems, such as our energy system, can intersect with it.  How Bitcoin deals with supply shocks  There were two major declines in the Bitcoin hashrate this past year. The first occurred in mid-April, when accidents at coal mines in Xinjiang province temporarily deprived many Chinese bitcoin miners of power. The second was the more long-lasting outcome of the permanent bans that Chinese provincial governments started imposing on mining activity in mid-May and continued throughout June. (See the chart in the “Off the Charts” section for illustration.)  In the first instance, average fees briefly spiked to record levels above $50 per transaction.  Here’s why fees rose at that time: The sudden reduction in total computational capacity among miners – which compete to “discover” the randomly generated number that will give one of them the right to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain and claim its attached bitcoin rewards – meant it was taking longer, on average, for the network to add new blocks. Measured against time, there was a reduced amount of blockspace, which meant buyers and sellers of bitcoin must now more aggressively compete for a reduced amount of blockspace. The result: They pay higher fees to miners.  This scenario will only last so long, however, because the Bitcoin protocol is designed to adapt to shifting hashrates and bring the market into equilibrium.  Every 2,016 blocks, the Bitcoin protocol alters the algorithm’s difficulty, adjusting it up or down depending on how long it took, on average, for the network to find the previous 2016 blocks. If the hashrate has fallen, difficulty declines, which speeds up block creation. That brings it back to the average 10 minutes per block that the system is designed to sustain over time and ends the squeeze on fees. The opposite occurs when the hashrate has risen.  Profit motives = quick responses and innovation  Even before this adjustment kicks in, the permissionless nature of bitcoin mining, combined with the allure of profits, leads to a more organic adaptation to conditions in a way that reflects its efficiency as a market.  In just six weeks in spring and early summer, Chinese authorities shut down a whopping 90 million terahashes per second of hash power, representing half the network. Yet, by year’s end, enough facilities had been set up elsewhere in the world to have fully recovered that lost capacity. The network, whose size is a proxy for how costly it is for someone to launch a 51% attack, is now not only back near record highs but spread disparately across the U.S., Kazakhstan, Russia, Canada, Iran, Malaysia, Germany and Ireland, among other countries. Bitcoin is now more secure and more decentralized.  Meanwhile, it only took until late July for average transaction fees to have come down to around $2, their lowest level in a year. They’ve now stabilized there, despite bitcoin’s market capitalization being more than five times what it was in July 2020.  (What’s especially impressive is that miners were able to overcome similar, real-world supply chain problems as those that are making a mess of American consumers’ holidays. There are currently big bottlenecks in the production of microchips, the most important vital component of mining equipment.)  We’re witnessing how the hyper-competitive nature of Bitcoin is spurring constant innovation – all the more so now that the hashrate, and difficulty, are back near record highs.  The hitherto rapid efficiency advances for application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) – the uber high-compute chips on which bitcoin mining depends – are now reaching a physical limit. That means miners, forever faced with relentless competition, are forced to find other means of extracting profits, primarily in developing and promoting more efficient renewable energy solutions.  They’re forging symbiotic relationships with power providers and grid operators, which are starting to use miners as on-off switches to better manage the otherwise expensive peaks and troughs of load variance in their electricity systems. (For a good read on this, see Nic Carter’s piece on mining’s role in renewable energy development in Texas from two months ago.)

Operators seem to expect more profits in the short term as Bitcoin has historically seen gains at the end of every year. However, BTC&apos;s price could remain rangebound for at least early 2022. After December 3rd crash into the lows at current levels, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain stability and has seen an increase in volatility. This could be the result of the violent move to the downside. In the coming weeks, data from Jarvis Labs suggest BTC&apos;s price could regain some stability. The firm shared some indicators and their predictions for what could be in play as the year wraps up. According to Jarvis Labs Wealth Multiplier, a metric used to measure the period when buyers choose to cash in their funds at a loss or profit has been recording higher lows as it diverges with BTC&apos;s price suggesting appreciation. This dynamic could be pointing at less volatility for Bitcoin. This matches with Jarvis Labs&apos; Price versus Circulation Ratio indicators which suggest the BTC has been very active in the past months. Standing at around 0.3, this metric needs to bottom at around 0.2 if the bulls want to reclaim momentum, as at the beginning of 2021.

42407249,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUKXGW,1639761664,10 Great Novels About Money (and Crypto),"If you’re reading this, chances are very good you’re part of an immensely privileged slice of humanity with access to what’s known as “leisure time.” Chances are also pretty good that you’re the type of psycho who wants to spend it as productively as possible. High up on my personal list of “Type A Maniac Life Hacks” is indulging in a great and entertaining book that also happens to teach me something.  So here, with the holidays upon us, is a “To-Do List of Educational Pleasure” for anyone who’s curious about money and finance in all their surreal complexity. Some of these books are big L Literature, and others are finely crafted entertainments. Several of them are both. And they’re all about that mystical institution, the thing everyone needs: lucre, beans, cheddar, lettuce, money.  This isn’t meant to be a definitive list – just 10 fantastic books in no particular order. There’s no time like the present.  This article is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment. It also published in The Node newsletter, which you can subscribe to here.  “Bartleby the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street” – Herman Melville (1850)  Sometimes described as the first existentialist novel (really a novelette), this manifesto of refusal is appropriately set in New York’s financial district circa 1850. Bartleby, for a time a hardworking clerk in a Wall Street law firm, suddenly begins to refuse all work, and indeed all activity, for no discernible reason. Despite the genuine concern of his employer, and against all apparent logic, Bartleby sticks to this principle until he dies of starvation in a debtor’s prison.  Bartleby’s vexatious behavior is never explained, making him a semi-mystical avatar for refuseniks everywhere. More specifically, some think “Scrivener” reflects Herman Melville’s deep rage at finance and the market. Now recognized as one of the greatest American novelists, the “Moby Dick”author found little success in his lifetime. He stopped writing fiction soon after “Bartleby.” His final novel, “The Confidence Man,” was also focused on finance.  “Bright Orange for the Shroud” - John D. McDonald (1965)  John D. McDonald is considered perhaps the greatest thriller writer of the 20th century. He penned the source material for Robert Mitchum and Robert DeNiro’s respective terrifying versions of “Cape Fear,” and no less a titan than Kurt Vonnegut described his work as “a treasure on the order of the tomb of Tutankhamen.” In this novel, hardboiled hero Travis McGee is trying to recover a friend’s money lost in a land development scam. It’s a sterling slice of cynical brutality, replete with backwoods hillbillies, crooked lawyers, savage beatings, suicides and just desserts. McDonald explored financial scams again a half-century later in “Condominium” (2014), about Florida real estate.  “The Bonfire of the Vanities” - Tom Wolfe (1987) and “The Way We Live Now” – Anthony Trollope (1875)  Written and published nearly a century apart, these two novels are a matched set satirizing the excesses of wealth – and, particularly, of wealth gained through speculation. Anthony Trollope’s work, inspired by London’s Panic of 1873, centers on a financier running a railroad stock pump-and-dump that’s so successful he makes it into Parliament before things fall apart. “There seems to be reason for fearing that men and women will be taught to feel that dishonesty, if it can become splendid, will cease to be abominable,” Trollope said of his motivation for the prescient work.  Prescient because, of course, the same thing was still happening a century later. Tom Wolfe’s “Bonfire” chronicles the rise and fall of a bond trader named Sherman McCoy. McCoy’s extravagant lifestyle makes him seem like the resident of a different universe until a single wrong turn puts him at the center of a web of intrigue, and ultimately brings him down. It is widely considered the seminal novel of the 1980s because it shows Wall Street graft, not in the form of a simple con, but as an entire legalized racket enmeshed in racism and class privilege.  “Cotton Comes to Harlem” - Chester Himes (1965)  This hard-boiled detective classic starts with a classic web of swindles: the hijacking of a community fund that may have been a scam to begin with. Published in 1965, “Cotton” featured two of the first Black detectives in popular fiction in the personages of “Grave Digger” Jones and “Coffin” Ed Johnson. But as you might guess, these aren’t the smooth investigators of Homicide or The Wire: Grave Digger and Coffin Ed pummel the bejeezus out of pretty much everyone who looks at them sideways. Its focus on grit and action is probably why this (also frequently hilarious) little book was turned into one of the first “blaxploitation” films in 1970, directed by Ossie Davis and co-starring Redd Foxx.     “High Rise” - J.G. Ballard (1975) and “Cosmopolis” - Don DeLillo (2003)  Another matched pair, “High Rise” and “Cosmopolis” offer parallel visions of the alienation that lurks at the top of the capitalist pyramid. In “High Rise,” British novelist J.G. Ballard captures the strange world of a self-contained, high-tech condominium and its inhabitants. Touted for its fantastic innovations and amenities, and its total insulation from the real world around it, the building descends into strange, primitive barbarism when a literal upstairs-downstairs class struggle disrupts its sheen of perfection.  Don DeLillo’s work shows a similar alienation in the figure of billionaire financier Eric Packer. Packer climbs into his limousine one day to go get a haircut, only to be treated to a street-level view of a political protest boiling across Manhattan. Over the course of a single improbably eventful day in which he does not leave the limousine, Packer witnesses a total upheaval of society – a breakdown that takes his Wall Street bags with it.  “JR” - William Gaddis (1975)  Though it’s a notoriously tough read thanks to William Gaddis’ experimental style, this National Book Award Winner is at heart a hilariously over-the-top satire. The titular JR is an 11-year-old boy who conceals his identity and launches a career as a penny-stock trader, soon becoming a paper millionaire. Today, a kid like JR would probably be praised as some sort of holy guru, but Gaddis’ goal was to lampoon the rising obsession with finance and stocks, even among kids who in a healthier society would be out playing in the streets. There has been some speculation that Gaddis’ prepubescent JR was an influence on the character J.R. Ewing, the bullheaded, comically manipulative Texas oilman at the center of the TV series “Dallas,” itself arguably a satire of 1980s excess.  “The Solar Lottery” – Philip K. Dick (1955)  Reflecting Philip K. Dick, often abbreviatedPKD’s, visionary (and borderline paranoiac) skepticism of the military and surveillance state, “The Solar Lottery” is set on a strange futuristic planet ruled by the logic of chance and game theory. That includes the use of a lottery in the regular selection of its leaders – and their assigned assassins. Though written in the 1950s, “Solar” contains many of the themes of Dick’s later, more radical work – above all, his firm loyalty to the little guy.  See also: Neil Strauss Pens the Bored Ape Yacht Club ‘Tell-All’  “Animal Money” - Michael Cisco (2015)  A book that’s nearly impossible to summarize or explain, so I’ll just quote “Annihilation” author Jeff VanderMeer’s valiant attempt: “‘Animal Money’ is about five economics professors who come up with the (surreal, radical) idea of animal money after meeting one another at the hotel of a conference they aren’t able to attend because they’ve all suffered coincidental injuries that require each to be heavily bandaged in some way.”  What do these bizarre figures mean by “animal money”? Is it living money made from animals? Is it money to be used by animals? They themselves barely seem to know as the novel winds through bizarre debates and slapstick capers. It’s a solid skewering of both academic pomposity and the menace of modern banking. It’s also a serious, if oblique, engagement with the deep mysteries at the heart of human finance.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,David Z.

42424051,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jwfh,1639758639,Former Head of Crypto-Skeptical SEC Gets Blowback for Pro-Blockchain Op-Ed,"Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Jay Clayton is being criticized for a pro-blockchain op-ed he wrote for the Wall Street Journal.  In his piece, which was published Thursday, Clayton argued the U.S. government needs to do more to harness the advantages of tokenization of assets via blockchain technology. For investors to pursue opportunities afforded by blockchain technology with confidence, they need assurance that they are protected by time-tested regulatory principles, he said.  His op-ed attracted some rather disparaging responses from commentators in the crypto community, given how his pro-crypto position differs from that which punctuated his reign as head of the SEC.  Clayton led the SEC during its crackdown on unregistered and fraudulent initial coin offerings. During his tenure, the commission also refused to approve the application of any exchange-traded funds and sued Ripple Labs, saying it violated U.S. securities laws by selling XRP to retail consumers.  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse responded to Clayton’s WSJ piece by tweeting: “Siri, play ‘Ironic’ by Alanis Morrisette.” Ryan Selkis, founder of crypto research firm Messari, then retweeted Garlinghouse’s comment and called Clayton a “shameless opportunist.”  This view of Clayton is borne out of the numerous positions he has amassed in the crypto world since leaving the SEC at the end of 2020. Clayton is currently a senior policy adviser at Sullivan & Cromwell, a law firm that advises a number of firms in the crypto industry such as infrastructure provider Fireblocks, a firm for which Clayton serves as a member of its board of advisors.  In March, Clayton also took on an advisory role at hedge fund One River Digital Asset Management, the parent company of the digital asset fund One River Digital. In May, he was appointed non-executive chair of Apollo Global Management, an investment giant with an interest in blockchain initiatives.  In his op-ed, Clayton wrote that “the government should actively facilitate the adoption of technology in core U.S. dollar funding and payments markets.”  He described this as “a matter of national security and financial stability” due to the importance of dollar primacy and stability to global economic development.  The government therefore needs to exploit its “head start,” Clayton argued, thanks to 95% of stablecoins being based on the U.S. dollar, meaning that it remains the preferred liquid store of value in digital asset markets. Clayton warned, however, that this could change.  One proposal he highlighted is to explore tokenizing the U.S. Treasury bond market to provide real-time trading, clearing and settlement of government bonds.

42390147,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUti1n,1639756984,Crypto Is the Biggest Thing to Change Culture Since Hip Hop,"Hip hop music in the 1980s was like the past decade in crypto. On the rise. Understood by few. Regional to mainly New York. Dismissed as a fad.  Pavel Bains is the CEO of Bluzelle. This article is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment.  Then, around 1990, it went national with Public Enemy, NWA, 2 Live Crew, Native Tongues Crew, countless others. It was embraced by the youth. Not just African Americans, but almost every minority in the U.S. and Canada, including my friends and I who were all first generation Indo-Canadians and Chinese-Canadians.  By 1992 hip hop style bled into sports and fashion. The Michigan “Fab Five” repped every kid in high school at that time. They shaved their heads like Onyx, wore their shorts extra baggy, talked brash and wore black socks. They were so influential that Nike rushed out a line of black socks. Nike had only sold white socks then.  Our clothing style changed because of rappers. Snoop Dogg even made wearing hockey jerseys cool. Starter caps were a must. And then, when Allen Iverson entered the National Basketball Association in 1996, the league was changed forever.  Some people hated the style. It launched an era of “respectability politics,” where pols and celebrities told kids to pull up their pants.  What was once considered a short-term trend – like a Tulip Bubble –became a legitimate global culture. I’ve travelled to almost every region of the world the past six years, and the one common culture is hip hop, even if you didn’t realize it.  The biggest fashion designer in the world, Virgil Abloh, who recently passed away, was purely hip hop. He was also every kid I knew growing up.  Having paid witness to growth and longevity of hip hop culture, I now see something similar with crypto. NFTs have made the crossover, and they’re never going away. It’s now not just money but an integral part of their products and youth identity. Non-fungible tokens rep kids today like Georgetown Starter Caps and Satin Jackets repped me and mine.  Crypto has changed how communities form around products. Discord, or something like it, will be the main platform for any project or brand that wants to connect with the youth. Crypto is real-time, it’s money, it’s a video game, it’s flexing, it’s anti-establishment. Sense a trend?  Boomers are trying to jump in and take ownership of this trend. They’re abusing the word “Web 3.” It reminds me of when a 1990s family sitcom with sagging ratings would introduce a Black kid dressed like a rapper to try to save their dated show. There is a saying in rap, “There ain’t no such thing as halfway crooks.” We can see what they are doing from a mile away.  See also: Music NFTs Are Set for an Explosive 2022  I had an interview a few weeks back and they asked me, “What are we going to say when a boomer googles ‘NFT’ and sees a bunch of crazy apes, frogs and wild stuff?”  I said, “Who gives a damn.” What did the boomers of the 1990s say when they heard about rap on TV? When they saw Tupac giving the finger, Ice T yelling “cop killer” and NWA saying “F**k The Police.” Boomers couldn’t stop it then, and they won’t stop a cultural movement now.  Crypto‘s ascendence into culture isn’t even for us, it’s for my teenage kid and her peers around the world. The difference is only a select group made the big money in hip hop. With crypto, we all can.",POSITIVE,없음,OTHER,Pavel Bains,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2021/12/17/crypto-is-the-biggest-thing-to-change-culture-since-hip-hop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0dd6939712a47e6975b8a924b8f4d365fcca420-3000x2389.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

During the last lap of the year, the market as a whole is not doing too well, although prices of cryptocurrencies are way higher than they were this time last year. Nonetheless, there have been some interesting trends that have emerged with the market crash that has seen prices stagnate at this time. The Fear &amp; Greed Index has shown that market sentiment has gone into the extreme negative once again. With prices of top assets like bitcoin and ethereum trading below important support points, sentiment has fluctuated widely in the market but has mostly stayed in the negative. This time around, market sentiment has dropped low and landed in the &apos;extreme fear&apos; territory.

In the future, users will be able to log in without the need for a third party, such as Meta, Google or Apple, the note adds.  Web 3 is the third generation of internet services which have been made possible by decentralized networks.  Goldman analysts feel that cryptocurrency is just the beginning for blockchain. Since 2017, blockchain has spread from the banking sector to more distributed applications across multiple verticals, such as communication and media and manufacturing, they note.  The Wall Street bank sees blockchain as the one of the most disruptive technology trends to appear since TCP/IP and HTML “ushered in the internet in the 1990s.”  “Investment implications are hard to predict at this juncture, but companies who are dependent on centralized control of user identity will likely find their business models challenged by the adoption of blockchain,” the report added.  The metaverse is an immersive digital world created by the combination of virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet.  One of the biggest endorsements for the metaverse came earlier this year when social media giant Facebook decided to rebrand itself to Meta, as a sign of its future focus. Meta (formerly Facebook) also announced that it was planning to hire 10,000 staff in the European Union to develop its metaverse.

42424062,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jwzh,1639742014,"Valkyrie Counters BIS, Says Concern on Bitcoin ETF Front-Running Is Misplaced","Bank for International Settlements (BIS) concern over speculators exploiting the monthly rollovers of bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from one contract to another is overdone, according to ETF manager Valkyrie.  It’s recognized that the funds are exposed to contango bleed, an over-time drawdown in performance due to end-of-month rollovers of long positions from expiring short-term contracts. The problem, however, can be exacerbated by speculators exploiting the monthly rollovers, according the BIS.  “The predictable rebalancing behavior of the ETF may also give rise to ‘front-running’ incentives, motivating investors to purchase longer-dated bitcoin futures in anticipation of the ETF rolling into those contracts,” BIS Economist Karamfil Todorov noted in a blog spot on Dec. 6.  While such front-running has had a significant bearing on traditional market ETFs’ performance in the past, there are no signs of traders employing a similar strategy in the crypto market yet, according to Valkyrie.  “We haven’t noticed any front-running specifically related to rolling the BTF futures,” Bill Cannon, head of ETF portfolio management at Valkyrie Investments, told CoinDesk. “Liquidity has been healthy, and there haven’t been any issues with execution.”  Valkyrie’s bitcoin futures ETF went live on Nasdaq under the ticker BTF on Oct. 22. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 19. The VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF, also futures-based, began trading last month.  These ETFs gain exposure to bitcoin through regulated futures contracts trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rather than owning the cryptocurrency. So, unlike ETFs that invest in stocks and gold, these futures-based ETFs must keep moving long positions from one expiry to another in a bid to mimic the cryptocurrency’s price performance.  That leaves the door open for traders to buy the next month’s contract and sell the expiring contract ahead of orders from ETFs. The funds end up paying more to buy the next month’s contract and receive less for selling the current month, leading to a bigger rollover loss.  The ETF roll and potential front-running  As of Thursday, Valkyrie’s ETF held 215 contracts (each representing 5 BTC) of December futures expiring at the end of the year. Some time before expiry, it will sell 215 December futures contracts and buy 215 contracts in January or longer-dated expiry. The Proshares ETF currently holding 3,803 December futures contracts, and VanEck holding 69 regular and 14 micro contracts will do the same.  The futures curve is in contango, meaning the longer-dated contracts are have higher prices than short-dated ones. The December contract is changing hands at $47,085 at press time, while the January contract is trading at $47,355, according to data tracked by TradingView. So, the ETFs will sell low and buy high during the rollover. That’s contango bleed.  According to BIS, had Proshares ETF been launched in 2018, it would have underperformed the spot price by 18% “on a cumulative basis over the following four years to date,” because of the bleed.  If traders front-run the roll by selling the expiring contract and buying the longer-dated one before the ETFs, the latter will become pricier. In other words, the contango will steepen, and the funds end up bearing a higher rollover cost than otherwise.  While it is difficult to estimate the exact figure of additional rollover loss caused by traders’ front-running ETFs, traditional market experience suggests the drawdown could be significant.  The U.S. Oil Fund LP trading on the NYSE under the ticker USO lost about $120 million while rolling 80,000 contracts from March to April maturities, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The United States Natural Gas ETF (UNG) became a target of front-runners a decade ago.  Easier said than done  While the monthly ETF rollovers provide a window of opportunity for traders, taking advantage of it might not be so easy.  “To successfully front-run, you need to be able to predict the short-term price moves of the underlying [asset] with relative confidence; the volatility of bitcoin and the crypto asset-class makes that a particularly difficult task, fraught with risk,” Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, said in a Telegram chat. “What makes crypto products unique, therefore, is that the volatility of the underlying essentially makes front running unviable.”  The three long futures-based ETFs discussed above are actively managed, meaning a manager or a team of experts decide on the allocations. So, predicting the exact timing of the rollover and whether the fund is rolling over to the next-month or longer-dated contract is a bit of a gamble. The ETFs can always diversify their holdings into different contracts to avoid the usual front-runners.  “While such a pattern is not easy to identify, this type of trading anomaly could occur at a time of rebalancing leveraged and short futures-based ETFs, where rebalancing needs are directly impacted by volatility on certain days,” Valkyrie’s Cannon said.  One trader from a major crypto exchange, who asked not to be named because of employer-imposed restrictions on making public statements, said the ETFs have a way of keeping markets honest.  “If they think too many market makers and speculators are front running their open interest roll, they will maybe wait a day or two, or they will do a certain amount of volume over-the-counter,” the trader said. “This freaks out the speculators, and they actually end up crashing the spread down [by unwinding the front-running trade] themselves, thinking the fund is not going to have the ammo in this particular period. It’s a big game of poker.”  There another effect: If too many speculators pile into the next month’s contract, the impact on the fund could be less marked. That’s because, as the fund starts rolling, speculators start liquidating their longs, building up selling pressure that pulls down the futures price and narrows the contango.  “This kind of public front-running is SO heavily exploited it often actually backfires,” Dave Nadig, director of research at ETF Trends, said in a Twitter chat. “We see that in things like Russell index rebalancing front runs. We saw it in VIX [stock market volatility] futures ETF for a while too. It’s a huge mistake to think of it as free money.”  UPDATE (Dec. 17, 12:27 UTC): Corrects verb in first paragraph.

42424060,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2jwxh,1639734378,"LUNA One of Few Cryptos Higher While Bitcoin, Others Slide","Crypto markets took a tumble in early European hours as financial regulators in the U.S. and U.K. took measures to curb growing inflation concerns earlier this week.  Bitcoin (BTC) followed a slide in global technology stocks, falling nearly $1,000 in Asian hours on Friday. Sentiment was dented after the Bank of England opted to end its asset-purchase program on Thursday, following Wednesday’s decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve to taper its bond buying program. Asian stock indexes fell, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 losing 1.79% and the Shanghai SE Composite dropping 1.16% on Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.47% Thursday.  The LUNA token associated with Terra, a high-speed blockchain, was one of the few cryptocurrencies to post gains with a 6% increase over 24 hours. LUNA rose to a high of $67 Thursday before retreating to $64 on Friday.  “Cryptocurrencies and the traditional market are trading down today in an initial response to various central banks around the world cutting back on bond purchases and other stimuli introduced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Bod Reid, founder of crypto payments tool Everest, in a Telegram message.  Investors will return to crypto markets when the appetite for risk picks up, he said. “With interest rates increased, investors would tend to be more favorable to traditional investments ahead of crypto, however, with the higher ROI [return on investment] that digital currencies and DeFi offers, the nascent asset class may win in the long run.”  LUNA has remained in an uptrend since November following a community proposal to “burn” tokens that pushed prices to an all-time high of $78. They have since mirrored a drop in the broader crypto market.  Technical indicators show strength for LUNA. It is trading above its 21-day exponential moving average – a tool used by traders to determine price trends based on historic prices – while the relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of price changes, remains at a favorable level of 53.30.  RSI readings over 70 suggest an asset is overbought, and may be set to decline, while readings under 30 indicate the opposite.  Solana’s SOL token also rose, adding 3%, and were the only other large-cap cryptocurrency in the green. Bitcoin fell 3.3%, following a rejection from the $49,200 level on Thursday, while ether fell 3.82% to $3,380 over the past 24 hours.  Despite the moves, funding levels on exchanges – the fee paid by traders to borrow money from exchanges to place bigger bets – remained positive for bitcoin, data from analytics tool Glassnode showed, implying traders are still placing bets on the upside.  Tokens associated with Elrond, Mina and XDC Network were the biggest losers among all coins with a market capitalization of above $1 billion, data from CoinMarketCap showed. Tokens EGLD, MINA and XDC have lost 14%, 7%, and 12% in the past day, respectively.  A standout among altcoins was YFI, the governance token of the Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) project Yearn Finance. YFI tokens jumped 18% on Friday after its developers announced the completion of a $7.5 million buyback, for 282.4 tokens, from the open market.  The move is part of a planned change in the project’s token strategy over the next few months. Yearn, like other decentralized finance projects, relies on smart contracts for financial services like lending, trading and paying out interest to token holders and was one of the so-called blue-chip DeFi tokens in 2020.",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNA | XDC,BTC | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING | XDC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/17/terra-one-of-few-cryptos-in-green-while-bitcoin-others-slide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0cac7dff0be2e8af8edb4f9148c6307535d4fc2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424073,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2k1hh,1639728219,Japan’s Crypto Exchanges Grapple With ‘Travel Rule’ as Deadline Looms,"With the deadline to implement the “travel rule” looming, Japan’s cryptocurrency exchanges say they are in negotiations with regulators to limit the rule’s scope to major tokens.  The travel rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs), like Japan’s crypto exchanges, to share customer data on transactions above a certain threshold. The rule was recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization that sets standards for financial policy for the G7 and another 30 or so developed countries.  In March of this year, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) requested virtual asset services providers to implement a framework to fulfill the travel rule. The Japan Virtual Assets and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA) is expected to introduce self-regulatory rules by April 2022, according to the same notice.  VASPs in Japan will send identifiable information on users to each other but won’t have to send user data to the regulator, representatives from Japanese VASPs told CoinDesk. The idea is that it makes it easier to identify suspicious transactions related to money laundering and terrorist funding.  “We have to replace our system,” Genki Oda, vice chair of the JVCEA and president of crypto exchange BITPoint, told CoinDesk.  “The timeline is quite tight,” said Takeshi Chino, managing director of Kraken Japan.  Chino said that most exchanges want to use existing solutions proposed by the vendors and that they are discussing interoperability, but so far there is no “clear answer.”  Another concern is that covering all assets places a heavy compliance burden on exchanges.  “We are not sure whether all of the member exchanges can comply if we start with all the asset classes, including minor tokens,” Chino said.  He added that the Japan Cryptoasset Business Association’s (JCBA) wants to take a “risk-based approach” and to “gradually increase the number of assets we cover under the travel rule.”  Chino said it was too sensitive to disclose specific details of discussions between JCBA members. He did reveal that among questions raised was who would be subject to the travel rule. Though the travel rule would be applied to inter-VASP transactions, he said it was not clear whether hosted wallets or cross-border transactions would also be subject to the rule.  AML and CFT  FATF found that Japan’s national policies “lack targeted AML/CFT [anti-money laundering and combating financing terrorism] activities,” according to an August report. The task force classed virtual asset risks among Japan’s higher risks.  Its assessment noted that Japanese mafia members were increasingly turning to virtual assets to launder proceeds from crime and that service providers were more focused on consumer protection than on money laundering or terrorist risks.  In response to FATF’s assessment, Japan’s FSA expects cryptocurrency exchanges to build system infrastructure which flags suspicious transactions.  Ken Kawai, lawyer at Anderson Mōri and Tomostune, expects Japan to revise its laws on AML/CFT in 2022 and to start implementing them in 2023.  Compliance costs  Implementing the travel rule is yet another compliance cost for Japan’s crypto exchanges.  “Most of the Japanese exchanges have made a loss over the last few years, although income of 2021 is becoming better,” said So Saito, Partner at So & Sato law firm based in Tokyo.  The industry is divided into two camps: those that can afford to keep up with the regulations and those that cannot. “The latter has been struggling to survive,” a spokesperson for exchange Bitbank told CoinDesk.  “Additional income sources that may be available to foreign exchanges such as high leverage trading are not available in Japan,” said Saito.  Japan halved the maximum leverage for margin trading to two times this year, far below Binance and FTX’s limit of 20x.  “The industry has asked the FSA to ease the regulatory burden as the strict regulations will ultimately drive consumers overseas where they will not be protected at all,” said Saito.
