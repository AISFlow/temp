The Serum price analysis for today is certainly bearish as the coin is currently seeing heavy pressure from bears. The bulls have been in charge of the price action as the cryptocurrency surged from $7.2 to $13.7 from 8th September to 11th September. This huge surge in the price of the coin attracted a lot of investors who were impressed by the brilliant performance of the coin.

42412054,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otca4A,1631384263,"Gas-Guzzling, Worthless On-Chain Pet Captivates Ethereum Community","A gas-guzzling side project from an increasingly high-profile developer has attracted the attention of the Ethereum community, but without incentive structures and limited utility, it’s unclear exactly why.  Dom Hofmann, who co-founded the defunct social media video platform Vine, is building a fervent following after the success of a number of Ethereum-based projects and self-described “experiments.” A text-based non-fungible token (NFT) project he released for free last month, Loot (for Adventurers), now accounts for over $200 million in secondary market sales.  While his latest effort appears unlikely to reach the same heights, it does have people paying serious crypto just to interact with it.  On Friday Hofmann announced via a tweet the launch of WAGMIGOTCHI, a smart contract without a front end that allows users to care for a digital pet with various needs. If one of the needs is not met, the pet “dies” and users cannot further interact with the contract.  “WAGMIGOTCHI has four attributes that increment every 50 blocks: boredom, uncleanliness, hunger and sleepiness,” Hofmann told CoinDesk in an interview on Discord, adding:  “The actions play, clean, feed and sleep always reset their corresponding attribute, but will sometimes increment a different attribute on top of what they’ve already gained naturally. For example, feed resets hunger but increments boredom and a little bit of uncleanliness.”  Read more: The Latest NFT Fad Is a Text-Based Fantasy Game Building Block  Just minutes after Hofmann released the first version of the contract, overeager caretakers accidentally killed it.  “It was played with too many times consecutively and passed away from fatigue,” said Hofmann.  Take 2  Shortly after, Hofmann released a second version of WAGMIGOTCHI that included smart contractual tweaks ensuring that while playtime exhaustion could bring the digital pet up to the threshold of death, the only thing that can kill it is on-chain inactivity.  The more durable critter is now thriving, but may quickly become among the most expensive digital pets ever: at the time of writing and roughly 16 hours since its publication, caretakers have interacted with the contract 3,300 times, spending over 13 ETH in gas fees worth over $43,000. Meanwhile, in the physical world, a cloned dog costs $50,000.  Aside from participating in a project from Hofmann – who wields growing notoriety as a high-profile (and unusually prolific) developer – it’s unclear what incentives there are to keep WAGMIGOTCHI “alive.” Caretakers earn one LOVE per interaction, which is not a token but an arbitrary number the contract records for each interacting Ethereum address.  Read more: Loot Holders Get $51K AGLD Airdrop Because NFTs  To an outsider, WAGMIGOTCHI’s etymology is likely as baffling as its lack of utility.  The name is a portmanteau of the acronym for “We’re All Gonna Make It,” a popular phrase in trading circles used to express bullish sentiments, and “Tamagotchi,” the faddish handheld digital pets from the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Add-ons and knock-offs  As with previous Hofmann side projects, developers have mobilized to build a rapidly expanding ecosystem of add-ons and knock-offs. One developer has built an interface that tracks the status of WAGMIGOTCHI and makes interacting with its contract easier, while others have focused on creating more scalable versions of the pet as well as utility for the LOVE score, Hofmann told CoinDesk.  Given the gas costs, scalability is weighing on Hofmann in particular.  “While these projects are generally artistic experiments and it’s the nature of the network, transaction fees are still something I feel guilty about personally,” he said. “I’m looking into other options that I might be able [to] incorporate into future projects.”  Even with the high gas prices, however, people do crazy things for LOVE.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/11/gas-guzzling-worthless-on-chain-pet-captivates-ethereum-community,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/058536cd39aadc4c315a5b8dbc0c0f479fd71771-4849x3638.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424668,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVk3h,1631361600,On Having Fun Staying Poor,"If you’ve ever publicly expressed the slightest reservation about bitcoin going to $10 million, a pleb – a vocal defender of bitcoin named after the plebeian class of ancient Rome – has probably told you to have fun staying poor. It’s meant as an insult, but of course plenty of people have fun staying poor. They sip lemonade on front porches, go on long walks, sing songs, swim in lakes and don’t think or care much about money.  But what about people who heard about bitcoin when it was $10, or $100, or $1,000 or $10,000 but had concerns and didn’t buy it? What about people who have decided not to buy bitcoin, and let’s assume that bitcoin will go up in value. Can they have fun staying poor? Or are the plebs exhorting them to do something impossible?  Bradley Rettler is assistant professor of Philosophy at the University of Wyoming. He is co-authoring a book on bitcoin as a tool to resist corporate and state overreach. This post is part of a series called Crypto Questioned, a place to discuss the ideas and philosophies that drive the cryptocurrency industry.  Well, first let’s talk about being poor. “Poor” is an inherently comparative term; what is poor in one time and place may not be poor in another time and place. Normally the comparison is made to those around you. But even very wealthy people have been told to have fun staying poor – like Elon Musk. So the relevant comparison class cannot be the general population. The comparison the plebs have in mind must be your future self who bought bitcoin. If you continue to fail to acquire bitcoin, then compared to that future self, they’re saying, you will be staying poor.  Let’s break it down further. What does it mean to have fun? At first glance, it might seem that having fun is the same thing as experiencing pleasure. But that’s not quite right. You can experience pleasure by being done with work at 5 p.m. on a Friday, but it’s not (usually) fun to walk to your car. You can experience pleasure while you’re fixing your car (the satisfaction of a job well done), but it might not be fun. Same for any other task that’s physically or cognitively demanding – running a marathon, doing the Saturday New York Times crossword.  So there can be pleasure without fun. I doubt there can be fun without pleasure. “I’m having fun, but I’m not enjoying it” lacks credibility. If that’s right, then I think we can say that fun is a particular kind of pleasure. An untroubled, lighthearted, amused kind of pleasure.  Can you have fun being poor? This seems like a category mistake, because being poor isn’t an activity. And if fun is an untroubled, lighthearted, amused kind of pleasure, it doesn’t seem like being poor is something you’d do to get that kind of pleasure. But of course you can have fun while being poor, for example, by racing someone, or swimming in a river, or playing a game of Duck, Duck, Goose. Similarly, asking whether someone can have fun staying poor seems like a category mistake.  But can someone have fun while staying poor? That is, can someone who heard about bitcoin and didn’t buy it have fun later on in their life after bitcoin has gone up in value? One thing we might consider is what kinds of things they find fun now. Will those things remain fun for them after bitcoin goes up in value? It seems reasonable to think they will. Bitcoin going up in value will not affect their enjoyment of playing games with their children, or traveling to new places or sipping a beer on their front porches.  It seems like the only way to say that someone can’t have fun staying poor is to think that they will be so filled with grief by their failure to buy bitcoin that it will pervade their entire lives. When they try to do things they once enjoyed, the fun will have been sucked from them because of their constant thoughts of bitcoin, and they’ll cry salty tears. This seems unrealistic. So it is possible to have fun while being poor, and possible to have fun while staying poor.  Read more: A Dictionary for Degens | Opinion  But is someone who stays poor bound to have less fun than they have now, and less fun than they could have had had they bought bitcoin when they heard about it? That seems plausible for two reasons. First, they have less money than they would have. They can buy fewer things. They can go fewer places. They have to work more. Second, occasionally they’ll think of the fact that they could have bought an appreciating asset and didn’t. They’ll berate themselves when at times they could have congratulated themselves (had they bought an appreciating asset), and that will make it harder to have fun at those times.  And they might also take out their grief on the world around them – say, by trolling bitcoiners on Twitter.  It would be nice if we could see the plebs as being encouraging. “By not buying Bitcoin, you will be poorer than you would have been. That might make you sad at times as you think back on this conversation. But try not to be too hard on yourself. Keep having fun.” That’s how I choose to interpret it. I suspect I’m wrong. But I hope I’m right.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC,Bradley Rettler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/11/on-having-fun-staying-poor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e256b339388d9899504ca6f1d1e987ccf762ca4-2047x1151.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In addition, it comprises a built-in data transaction protocol to Phoenix Global Virtual Machine, which increases B2C trust, ensures consumer data ownership and security, and provides decentralized, encrypted data storage.

Phoenix Global proposes a data transaction engine that allows businesses to increase consumer data ownership and security, enhancing business-to-customer (B2C) trust. Businesses need pure and consistent consumer data to get an overview of a customer and offer exceptional service.

Because of this, a business needs to integrate a robust data transaction engine to match, deduplicate, and meld these records.

The founder of Jax.Network, Vinod Manoharan, aims to build a fully decentralized stablecoin which is more reliable than USD-pegged stablecoins. Although the Jax.Network blockchain is anchored to the Bitcoin protocol, its native token dubbed JAX shouldn&apos;t be as volatile as BTC. One of the basic features of the technology is decentralization, which most stablecoins, including USDT and BUSD, have not been able to accomplish. In this article, we discuss the main reason why Manoharan and his team work with the Bitcoin protocol and what benefits Jax.Network gets from supporting Bitcoin. How Jax benefits from the Bitcoin blockchain Curb shard inflation - Anchoring to the Bitcoin blockchain helps to reduce inflation that might take place across Jax.Network shards. Since miners can merge-mine the Jax.Network beacon chain, shard chains, and Bitcoin, they can only mint JAX on the shard chain by burning their coming Bitcoin and JXN reward. This process helps reduce the rate of JAX issuance. It aims at transfering the value of BTC + JXN into JAX. Miners can arbitrage what is the most profitable for them: mining BTC+JXN or JAX, depending on the market conditions.Promoting early adoption - Implementing JAX into the Bitcoin protocol could be used to promote early adoption of the coin.
