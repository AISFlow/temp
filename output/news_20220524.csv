42423273,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Xlvh,1653435227,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Dominates but Altcoins Lurk,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin rises but remains below $30,000.  Insights: Bitcoin dominance is at an on-year high, but traders are preparing another alt-season.  Technician's take: Technical indicators are neutral and upside appears limited from here.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $29,672 +2%  Ether (ETH): $1,978 +0.4%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Ethereum Classic ETC +12.8% Smart Contract Platform Filecoin FIL +5.2% Computing EOS EOS +4.7% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Bitcoin fares better than other major cryptos  Bitcoin wasn't going anywhere fast late Tuesday.  The largest cryptocurrency was up slightly but still trading below $30,000 and about midway in the two thousand dollar range that it has occupied for almost two weeks since the crash of the UST stablecoin. Other major cryptos also rallied late to hit green, albeit not by much, as investors gripped tightly to their risk-averse bearishness.  Near the time of publication, bitcoin was trading at about $29,700, a 2% gain. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was recently up less than a percentage point, while XRP, SOL and the meme coin SHIB each rose over 1%. Bitcoin's price has dropped for eight consecutive weeks.  ""Bitcoin is in the danger zone as sentiment for risky assets have fallen off a cliff,"" Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya wrote.  Macroeconomic news offered little encouragement for investors.  Stocks about-faced from their healthy Monday gains after social media platform Snap Inc. (SNAP) issued a profit and earnings warning that swept up the tech sector, and the U.S. Commerce Department reported that new home sales plummeted 17% in April to hit a two-year low. The tech-focused Nasdaq plunged 2.3%. The S&P 500 also fell, albeit more moderately.  Snap shares declined over 40% from their Monday close after the company said its revenue and profit would miss earlier projections for its second quarter, a victim of inflationary pressures and macroeconomic turmoil. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company's CEO, Evan Spiegel, said in a presentation prior to the warning that he had asked managers to look for cost savings. Tech giants Meta (FB) and Google (GOOG) dropped about 7% and 5% respectively  The housing report reflected the impact of rising mortgage rates on would-be home buyers who are now priced out of loans they might have afforded when borrowing costs were lower earlier in the year. Meanwhile, the manufacturing and service purchasing managers index dropped to three- and four-month lows, primarily victims of rising prices.  In the smallest sliver of good news, the bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, which has been stuck in ""fear"" zone over the past month and reached its second-lowest recorded fear level in the index's history last week, has improved slightly the past few days, suggesting bearish sentiment could diminish, particularly if bitcoin crosses $30,000.  But Oanda's Moya noted that even falling Treasury yields, ""which makes crypto attractive,"" have failed to move investors. ""Right now, no one wants to buy this dip,"" he wrote, adding that bitcoin could test support just above $25,000 and that $20,000 remains a possibility. ""Bitcoin can't stabilize until Wall Street sees calm and that might not happen for a little while longer.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,941 -0.8%  DJIA: 31,928 +0.1%  Nasdaq: 11,264 -2.3%  Gold: 1,866 +0.6%  Insights  Bitcoin Dominance is at an on-year high, but traders are preparing for another alt-season  As bitcoin continues to trade comfortably within the $30,000 range, data shows the cryptocurrency’s dominance of the digital asset market has shot upward and is now just under 45% of total market capitalization, a high for the year.  Bitcoin’s dominance of the broader crypto market cap reflects traders’ risk tolerance and market sentiment. When conditions turn bullish, traders move capital into Ethereum and other layer 1, or base, blockchains in order to take advantage of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Likewise, a bearish market brings back traders into the safe haven of bitcoin, crypto’s ""digital gold.""  With the implosion of the Terra ecosystem, many layer 1s have been hit hard: Solana is down 50% during the last month, Avalanche is down 60% during the same period, and Polygon lost just over 53% of its value.  While Terra’s collapse leaves many with existential questions about the future of crypto and DeFi as an investment vehicle, traders appear to be preparing to return to altcoins, with data suggesting that bitcoin’s dominance might be short-lived.  According to CoinGlass, funding rates for ether and major alts are working in the favor of long traders. Funding rates are turning negative, which means that short sellers are being liquidated in favor of those with long positions.  Likewise, the ratio of long positions to short has moved in favor of longs for ether, DOT and SOL as per CoinGlass’ data.  There’s still a long way to go before we can declare another season of the alts, despite a few green sprouts. The total value locked into DeFi protocols, the vehicle in which many alts are used, doesn’t show any signs of improvement.  DeFiLlama has the total locked-in value at $111 billion, down from around $205 billion at the start of the month, before Terra’s planetary collapse, and well below the $250 billion in DeFi in December of last year.  The fact that so much wealth vanished in the last two weeks is going to give many traders pause, especially as institutional investors lost billions of dollars. But we are seeing that conviction remains in the asset class, even as it's tested time and time again.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Range-Bound; Support at $27K, Resistance at $33K  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade in a tight range, struggling to make a decisive break above or below $30,000. The cryptocurrency found support around $27,500, which has stabilized price action over the past week.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from oversold levels, but remains capped below the 50 neutral mark. A move above 50 in the daily RSI would confirm a brief recovery in price. For now, upside appears to be limited, initially toward the $33,000-$35,000 resistance zone.  Momentum signals are improving on the daily chart, but remain negative on the weekly and monthly charts. That could increase the risk of a breakdown in price, similar to what occurred in earlier this month.

Will the downfall breach $0.050? Key technical points: ZIL price approaches the $0.050 mark. The Stochastic RSI threatens a bearish reversal with a negative crossover. The 24-hour trading volume of Zilliqa is $168 Million, indicating a fall of 39.09%. Past Performance of ZIL The falling channel pattern is a sign of a general decline in ZIL price that recently fell to a record low of $0.038, an 82.6 percent drop from the previous high. A successful retest of $0.0 58 offered a bearish opportunity to take advantage of the long-term trend and restart the downfall. Source-Tradingview ZIL Technical Analysis With the overall market declining steadily, the ZIL price has experienced an ebb and flow since its recent retest of $0.058. However, the decline has erased almost all the gains that coin owners had experienced during the past week. Moreover, the falling trend within the bearish pattern negatively impacts the crucial daily EMAs. The 50, 100, and 200-day EMA regain the bearish alignment with the recent crossover event. The RSI slope is not able to maintain an upward trend in the oversold area because it is experiencing an abrupt rise in the selling tension. Furthermore, Stochastic RSI shows the K and D lines stop an upward trend and are positioned to increase the bearish spread following the merger.

He answered “no” when asked if SWIFT, the current interbank messaging system that allows for cross-border payments, will exist in five years' time.  He smiled during his answer but the crowd seemingly took his answer seriously.  Miebach spoke on a panel adjacent to the World Economic Forum’s annual (WEF) summit hosted by the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC). The panel discussed the future of cross-border payments and the potential of CBDCs in the financial system.  “If you can get a payment with all the data attached that you need as a company [...] the cost savings of that in addition to a payment cost that is lowered, and the overall productivity boost, we can expect if we do this well, that’s the real goal here,” Miebach said on the panel.  The conference officially kicked off Tuesday, with crypto being mentioned frequently in panels adjacent to the conference. The subject is bolstered by the strong presence of crypto companies on promenade, the main street leading up to the Congress, where official WEF panels take place.  Read more: At Davos, Crypto Is No Longer on the Outside  Also part of Tuesday’s panel was Jennifer Lassiter, executive director of the Digital Dollar Project; Yuval Rooz, the CEO of Digital Asset; David Treat, a director at Accenture and co-founder of the Digital Dollar Project; and Jon Frost, senior economist at the Bank of International Settlements. They all said SWIFT will still exist in five years.  Miebach was the only one to say that maybe in the near future SWIFT might not be the dominant system to transfer money across continents. Both Lassiter and Rooz also seemed to think SWIFT may one day be replaced, but said that five years won’t likely be enough time.  A Mastercard spokesperson downplayed the impact of Miebach’s response in a statement sent via email after the panel.  “Let us clarify the intent of the on-stage comment as it’s not as simple as a yes or no answer. Michael was simply reinforcing what SWIFT has previously said – their operations continue to evolve. Its current form will not be the same in the future. They are adding more functionality and moving past just being a messaging system,” the spokesperson said.  But attendees at WEF are nonetheless paying attention.

He’s now taking that written work online and hands-on with an educational platform where users can run “engage to earn” modules that teach them the ropes.  Metacademy is hardly alone in launching educational content for crypto newcomers. From stablecoin issuers such as Circle to government institutions such as the U.S. Treasury, there’s a rush to educate the investing public on crypto and its risks. Some companies like Coinbase (COIN) even reward users with crypto for learning via their modules.  Metacademy.xyz, however, is focusing its attention on educating from the top down by targeting executives.  Metacademy’s goal is to provide free educational resources for businesses seeking to educate their employees on purchasing crypto, minting non-fungible tokens (NFT) and tapping into DeFi, according to a press release.  “I want all of my clients to be able to put their execs through [Metacademy] and give everybody an opportunity to understand what a consumer journey might look like if they were going to do an engage-to-earn project,” co-founder Shelly Palmer told CoinDesk in a phone call.  Users who signed up for the beta complete lessons on various Web 3 topics and can practice their knowledge with Metacademy’s DeFi sandbox, where they can sling simulated tokens without any of the on-chain risk.  Palmer said that soon, users who complete the site’s 14 modules will be able to mint their certification of the program as an NFT, affording them VIP access to Metacademy events and experiences.  “Ultimately we're going to really push the engage-to-earn by giving things a real value,” said Palmer.  Metacademy launched its public beta Sunday morning, with 2,000 users registered as of Monday, Palmer said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/24/web-3-education-platform-pitches-earn-while-you-learn-to-business-executives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05d2db4f51961d80709760b557cc7b4689db49e2-1853x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Alexandre Lores, director of blockchain market research at Quantum Economics, said stablecoin issuers like Tether, the issuer of USDT, the largest of the stablecoins, should be providing external audits of underlying assets.  “I think more transparency is needed in terms of showing what they [Tether] actually hold on the balance sheet,” Lores said on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover"" program.  Read more: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA  USDT, which is supposed to be pegged 1:1 with the value of the U.S. dollar, is hosted on blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tron. USDT most recently had a $10 billion drop in its circulating supply, placing its market capitalization at just above $73 million, according to CoinGecko.  As questions linger about the feasibility and safety of stablecoins in general, USDT’s issuer has had past regulatory run-ins. In October it was fined for more than $42 million by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for allegedly violating the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations. According to the CFTC, Tether’s stablecoins were not fully backed at all times. Tether and a sister company also paid an $18.5 million settlement in February 2021 to close an investigation by the New York Attorney General's office.  Now, as Tether looks to reassure investors while meeting its legal obligations, its latest attestation report, as of March 31, reveals that $286 million of Tether’s assets were being held in non-U.S. Treasury bonds with a maturity of less than 180 days. That revelation was not included in its previous December report.  Lores said Tether’s opaqueness will remain an issue because markets are down and investors are moving to preserve their assets. He said that could change if investors grow more interested in seeking greater profits.  “It’s a short-term change as long as the bear markets continue, which I personally think is going to happen for at least the next year,” Lores said.  He added that backing a stablecoin with a volatile asset makes no sense at all and “as long as they [Tether] have not provided transparent audits of their treasury in real time, it’s going to remain a problem,” he said.

LRC crypto is steady in the last trading day but up 71 percent from 2022 lows. Buyers have targets set at $0.66 in the short term. Past Performance For the first time in over six weeks, Loopring crypto prices are trading above the middle BB. This formation follows sharp gains on May 23 that propelled the token to spot rates. In the past trading day, the LRC coin price is up four percent and up a massive 71 percent from 2022 lows. Loopring Technical Analysis LRC technical analysis shows the crypto prices are bottoming up at spot rates. Trading at $0.56 versus the USDT, Loopring token bulls have satisfactorily reversed the losses of May 11 with rising trading volumes. Therefore, buyers have the upper hand from an effort versus results perspective. Based on the LRC token candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, traders may begin loading the dips ideally above $0.45. The immediate target, in this case, stands at May 24 highs at $0.66. Conversely, if prices retrace below $0.45, the uptrend could face headwinds, slowing down the recovery. What to Expect from LRC? There are encouraging developments for Loopring crypto prices in the daily chart. However, what&apos;s required is confirmation of May 23 gains and a firm close above the middle BB.

Hsu, the acting chief of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), spoke at the DC Blockchain Summit in Washington on Thursday, saying the cryptocurrency industry has an unhealthy “dependency on hype” that he thinks is getting worse.  ""The recent collapse of the terraUSD stablecoin and associated sell-off in crypto markets has shown that hype-driven growth can lead to bubbles, harm consumers and crowd out productive innovation,"" said Hsu, whose agency will likely have a prominent role in regulating stablecoins and chartering crypto firms seeking to become banks.

That disclosure from the big U.S. exchange also prodded the Biden administration to decide to press Congress for new segregation rules that would wall off customer assets, CoinDesk has reported.

42411123,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gizUnf,1653425630,How Web 3 Changes Philanthropy,"Ten years ago, the rebels hadn’t won. There was no Web 3. No non-fungible tokens (NFTs), no decentralized finance (DeFi), no decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). No Coinbase, no Ethereum, no a16z Crypto.  Now, in 2022, we have all of these things.  Elon Musk pitches dogecoin on Twitter. The Miami Heat shoot hoops in the FTX Arena. Matt Damon shills crypto to millions during the Super Bowl.  Rhys Lindmark is CEO and co-founder at Roote, a nonprofit startup studio tackling problems with systems-level design. He will present a version of this essay on the ""Big Ideas"" stage at CoinDesk's Consensus festival, which runs June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  Now our feeds are full of NFT profile pictures, there are tokens worth $100 billion staked across dozens of DeFi ecosystems, and DAOs (almost) buy constitutions and Parisian art. Meanwhile, FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried casually becomes President Joe Biden’s second-largest donor.  Web 3 is the biggest wealth creation event in history. The crypto rebels have won.  But we’re only 10 years in. What will happen in 2040? What does this mean for society? What does this mean for philanthropy?  To understand what will happen in 2040, we will look at three angles:  Past: Web 3 in the history of wealth creation events.  Present: How crypto whales are leveraging their wealth today.  Future: Decentralized solarpunk society.  Past: Web 3 in the history of wealth creation events  A decade ago, crypto billionaires didn’t exist. Now there are dozens of them, with Twitter-optimized acronyms, such as ""SBF"" for Sam Bankman-Fried and ""CZ"" for Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao.  We’ve seen this before. The old rich give way to the new rich. Emperors like Ghengis Khan and Caesar used to control all wealth.  Then the Industrial Revolution birthed billionaire oil magnates like John D. Rockefeller and steel magnates like Andrew Carnegie.  Read more: Anonymous Crypto Donors Are Changing Philanthropy  Computers and Web 1 birthed billionaires like Bill Gates and Michael Dell. Web 2 created the elite of today: Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. And now, Web 3 has created SBF and CZ.  But are these crypto billionaires like SBF and CZ just a flash in the pan? Or are they forerunners of an impending wave of wealth creation?  1. How people get rich now  In April 2021, Paul Graham wrote an essay, ""How People Get Rich Now."" By looking at the Forbes top 100 richest people, Graham shows how wealth creation has shifted over the past century from Industrial Tech to Inheritance and now to Digital Tech.  First, Graham shows how wealth shifted from Industrial Tech (in 1892) to Inheritance (in 1982).  In 1892, the New York Herald Tribune compiled a list of all the millionaires in America. How many had inherited their wealth then? Only about 20%. Instead, economist Hugh Rockoff found that ""many of the richest ... gained their initial edge from the new technology of mass production.""  Also in this series: Matt Prewitt: Let’s Use New Forms of Money to Commit to Our Communities  But by 1982, the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the 100 richest people, 60 inherited it from an ancestor. There were 10 du Pont heirs alone.  We can visualize this on the simple graph below to show how wealth became more inherited over the course of the 20th century.  This led to the rise of Investing and Digital Tech. Paul Graham again: By 2020, the number of heirs had been cut in half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes.  Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 30 derive from Digital Technology, 26 from Industrial Technology and 17 from investing.  What about crypto, the intersection of Digital Technology and Investing?  Graham didn’t look at crypto in 2021, but by 2022 we now have two crypto billionaires in the top 100: SBF and CZ.  The graph has a new player in town, crypto (in orange at the top).  It may not seem like much, but rarely do we find an entirely new category for how the wealthiest people create their wealth.  More importantly, is this a trend? Will the graph soon be covered in orange?  2. How many crypto billionaires will there be?  Serial entrepreneur, investor and influential essayist Balaji Srinivasan and Polychain Capital founder and CEO Olaf Carlson-Wee estimate that:  That’s a massive shift in who controls wealth. Does it hold up? We can do some napkin math to find out.  How many billionaires are there? There were only 15 billionaires in 1982, but there are now 2,668, and we'd expect that number to rise to around 3,300 by 2025.  But how many crypto billionaires are there?  Given crypto’s volatility and pseudonymous nature, this is a difficult question to pin down.  For simplicity, let’s use Forbes’ estimate of 19 crypto billionaires.  So our graph actually looks like this:  Again, this new crypto blip is pretty small. Right now only 1% of billionaires are crypto billionaires (19/2,668).  However, this is something categorically different. The real question is: What’s the trendline? Will orange crypto take over the chart?  More napkin math: As I write this, bitcoin (BTC) is at $30,000. What happens if, by 2025, BTC goes to $200,000, and the rest of crypto rises with it? This would give you roughly 400 BTC billionaires, 200 ether (ETH) billionaires, and 200 other billionaires.  With 800 new crypto billionaires, we’d get a graph like this:  This would make the 800 crypto billionaires around 20% of the total. With this rough napkin math, I disagree with Srinivasan and Carlson-Wee that $200,000 BTC makes 50% of billionaires crypto billionaires. I think it’s more like 20%. Still, 20% is a huge increase. And $200,000 BTC is not unlikely.  Coming back to Graham’s article, we could expect the graph to look something like this:  That’s a huge change! The orange number goes way up.  Finally, all of the math above doesn’t even include the long tail of wealth creation.  BTC mining created thousands of millionaires. The ETH initial coin offering (ICO) created thousands more. DeFi created thousands of degen millionaires too.  No matter how you do the math, Web 3 is a huge wealth creation event. How will the nouveau riche leverage it?  II. Present: How crypto whales are leveraging their wealth today  We all know the famous quote (misattributed to Gandhi):  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.  There’s a version of this but for digital technology in Web 2 and Web 3:  First they ignore your protocols. From TCP/IP to ERC-20 and ERC-721.  Then they laugh at your Super Bowl ads. From Pets.com to Crypto.com.  Then they fight your influence. From the U.S. banning file sharing to China banning bitcoin mining.  Then you win … and get a crappy government implementation from Healthcare.gov to ""GovCoin Coming Soon.""  Another framework of technology adoption is Carlota Perez’s S-Curve. All tech goes from the Installation Period to the Deployment Period.  Web 3 is still in the Installation Period. How is it impacting society today?  We can break this up into three categories:  Value creation: The direct impacts of Web 3.  Excess capital: philanthropy and Web 3.  #SquadWealth: collaborative ecosystems in Web 3.  1. Value creation: The direct impacts of Web 3  First, we can understand Web 2 impacts by looking at tech company mission statements:  Microsoft: A computer on every desk and in every home.  Google: To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.  Facebook: To make the world more open and connected.  Amazon: Where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online.  But in Web 3, mission statements are focused on money instead of information:  Coinbase: To increase economic freedom in the world.  OpenSea: Building an open digital economy.  FTX: A cryptocurrency exchange built by traders, for traders.  The direct impacts of Web 3 will be a digital economy, open to the entire world.  2. Excess capital: Philanthropy and Web 3  Web 2 birthed a set of “traditional” foundations like:  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  Schmidt Futures.  Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative.  MacKenzie Scott Foundation.  Open Philanthropy.  Web 3 is going a bit weirder.  Brian Armstrong is funding $100M for longevity research.  SBF kickstarted the FTX Future Fund, which doubled the amount of money focused on longtermism. (See graph below.) He’s also given $10M+ to Carrick Flynn, an effective altruist political candidate from Oregon. (This is 3x the donations of any other House candidate.)  3. #SquadWealth: Collaborative ecosystems in Web 3  Finally, we can look at the long tail of wealth creation.  In Web 2, this primarily manifested as AngelList syndicates and angel investor networks. Groups of early employees who exit with tens of millions of dollars invest that money back into tech.  In Web 3, this goes even further. Every round is a community round, with NFT degens and crypto VCs aping in together. This will be supercharged with the Web 3-native version of syndicates, Syndicate DAO – here's a link to the first 100 investors. Crypto fundraising is community fundraising.  Read more: How Crypto Is Changing Philanthropy  But we also have a fully new form of community fundraising that is built on abundance, impact DAOs. These are collaborative networks that have positive externalities built-in.  Gitcoin Grants give back to the open-source community. KlimaDAO gives back to the environment. #DeSci gives back to fund new science research.  I like to think of these as DAOs that succeed in the presence of other DAOs, that also succeed in the presence of them. Here’s a map of the impact DAO space from Gitcoin and FiftyYearsVC.  People give back to fund crypto infrastructure through Gitcoin Grants. And then those grantors are rewarded later with retroactive public goods funding.  In Web 3, we’re seeing the huge impacts of crypto wealth through direct company impacts, philanthropic initiatives and new forms of #SquadWealth.  What will happen in 2040?  III. Future: Decentralized solarpunk society  We can project these three trends into the future to understand a decentralized solarpunk society (#DeSoc).  Value Creation: the direct impacts of Web 3.  Excess Capital: philanthropy and Web 3.  #SquadWealth: collaborative Ecosystems in Web 3.  The ideas below are speculative, but should give us a rough sketch for where we’re headed.  1. Value creation: The direct impacts of Web 3  Software is eating the world.  Web 2 started by eating bits then moved to atoms.  Web 3 will finish eating bits then move to atoms too.  Meatspace and the metaverse will be fully intertwined with internet and blockchain protocols.  Just as the Enlightenment separated church and state, crypto will separate money and the state.  Every community will have a currency.  Every person will have a Soul (a far-reaching identity token idea) and every Soul will work in trusted networks.  The Network State will form in the cloud, then will push down into every acre of land.  2. Excess capital: Philanthropy and Web 3  In addition to Coinbase Giving and FTX Future Fund, there will be dozens of massive Web 3 foundations that give in a bottom-up way.  These foundations will take the form of what Nadia Asparouhova calls idea machines, funded organisms that turn ideologies into outcomes.  3. #SquadWealth: Collaborative ecosystems in Web 3  In 1976, Vanguard gave retail investors access to the stock market index. Now we have new indices on crypto like the Coinbase 10, DeFi Pulse, DeFi Innovation and NFT Index. Through indices like these, the public will collaboratively own and benefit from Web 3 (and AI) wealth creation.  There will be a clear risk-adjusted investment ladder for public goods projects, like VC is an investment ladder for startups. We will have seed, Series A, Series B, etc. but for nonprofit public goods. Donors will be repaid through retroactive public goods funding.  Company mergers and acquisitions will phase out in favor of DAO token swaps and shared liquidity pools. The ecosystem of DAOs will rise and fall together as a complex adaptive system.  Software is eating the world. Crypto accelerates that process.  By 2040, Web 3 will be the water we swim in – full of crypto whales, millionaire minnows and the rest of us small krill.

The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has been stuck in ""fear"" zone over the past month and reached its second-lowest recorded fear level in the index's history last week. Still, the index has recovered slightly over the past few days, which suggests extreme bearish sentiment could start to wane, especially if BTC recovers above $30,000.  For now, most alternative cryptos (altcoins) underperformed bitcoin on Tuesday, which suggests a lower appetite for risk among traders. For example, ether (ETH) declined by 4% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 2% decline in BTC. Avalanche's AVAX dipped by 9% and Fantom's FTM token fell by 14% on Tuesday.  Typically, alts decline more than BTC in down markets because of their higher risk profile.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  From a technical perspective, price bounces could be limited until long-term momentum improves. That could point to a full year of lower returns for stocks and cryptos relative to the strong uptrend in 2020.  Volatile markets could offer opportunities for short-term traders who do not commit to price trends and can take long or short positions. Likewise, investors who are nimble enough to reduce risk can deploy unused cash for the next up cycle in asset prices.  But timing price shifts can be difficult over the short term. For example, on average, bitcoin tends to yield positive returns during periods of extreme bearish sentiment, according to Arcane Research. ""Bitcoin has also seen continued sell-offs following extreme fear. Thus, you should not blindly expect that buying into fear and poor momentum is profitable.""

Diminishing returns  The chart below shows a long-term decline in bitcoin's compound annual growth rate (CAGR), provided by Glassnode, a crypto data platform.  As bitcoin's market size increases, more capital is required to move market prices. That can result in diminishing returns over time as the crypto asset matures.  ""We can see the marked decline in four-year CAGR following the May 2021 sell-off, which we have argued was likely the genesis point of the prevailing bear market trend,"" Glassnode wrote in a blog post.  But diminishing returns are not just a result of larger market size.  From a macro perspective, a long period of accommodative monetary policy underpinned a strong rally in speculative assets, such as stocks and cryptos, over the past few years. Bitcoin, in particular, has traded within four-year bull and bear cycles that produced higher returns relative to stocks, albeit with more volatility.  Currently, global investors are grappling with tighter monetary policy amid high inflation and slowing economic growth. That could produce diminishing returns in both traditional and crypto markets.  ""If inflation stays high for many years, both history and today's high starting valuations suggest it will be very difficult to generate positive real returns (adjusted for inflation) in most traditional financial asset classes,"" Deutsche Bank wrote in a research note. ""Nominal returns (without considering inflation) will also likely notably underperform their long-term trend. Commodities could be the exception.""  Altcoin roundup  Milady tumbles amid drama: Minimum prices (also called floor prices) for the popular non-fungible token (NFT) collection “Milady Maker” have slumped nearly 70% in the past week. The big price hit was an isolated event in the NFT market and likely linked to the drama that revealed its creator to have been a controversial personality linked to a popular online cult. The collection of 10,000 anime-inspired, computer-generated icons already had troubling baggage with sporting the name of a Nazi concentration camp on some of the artworks. Read more here.

Crypto firms push back against tax rule: Crypto industry representatives are battling with OECD to exempt decentralized finance and non-fungible token (NFT) transactions from tax reporting rules. The OECD, an international organization that includes most developed economies, is trying to introduce new rules to stop crypto from being used to stash assets out of sight of the taxman. On the other hand, digital asset companies opine that some crypto assets just don’t fit the same mold as other traditional assets, such as stocks or gold, and that applying the same rules would put too much burden on them.

Still, SUSHI is within a bear flag and inside the May 11 trade range. Past Performance SUSHI coin prices are steady, adding three percent in the previous trading day and retesting the middle BB. Although the crypto community is upbeat in the long-term, there could be a revival once SUSHIUSDT breaks above the middle BB. SUSHI crypto is up roughly 50 percent from 2022 lows at spot rates and notably outperforming the USDT. SushiSwap Technical Analysis SUSHI technical analysis indicates that the token prices could be bottoming up at spot rates. However, as mentioned earlier, there should be a comprehensive close above the middle BB at the back of increasing trading volumes. Based on this overview, SushiSwap prices are is still within a bear flag and inside the bear bars of May 11 and 12. A close above $1.80 may boost demand in the immediate term, paving the way for $2.30 and $2.70 in the days ahead. On the flip side, if bears flow back and SUSHIUSDT snaps to the dominant trend, losses below $1.25 may quickly diffuse the upside momentum. In that case, SushiSwap prices may dump to $1.10 or worse.

42423271,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Xlth,1653423939,FTX's Bankman-Fried Is Already a Political Mega-Donor. He's Doubling Down,"FTX exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried said in a podcast Monday he might donate up to $1 billion in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.  In an interview on the Pushkin podcast “What’s Your Problem?” the multi-billionaire crypto entrepreneur said he would spend “north of $100 million” on future political campaigns. This record-breaking number would be a “soft ceiling” for his donations, he said.  An effective altruist, Bankman-Fried is worth $20 billion and has already donated $200 million of his net worth, according to the podcast interview. Much of that has gone to political efforts: He donated $23 million to a single Political Action Committee (PAC) this year.  His political donations have yielded mixed results. Bankman-Fried was one of the single-largest donors backing President Joe Biden’s victorious 2020 campaign. But his favored candidate in an Oregon congressional primary was trounced last week despite benefitting from $11 million in Bankman-Fried PAC money.  For 2024 presidential spending, “it’s gonna depend on who is running,” Bankman-Fried told podcast host Jacob Goldstein. “I’m going to be looking a lot less at political party from that perspective and a lot more about sane governance.”  On Wednesday morning, Bankman-Fried posted a Twitter thread explaining his political views further in depth, saying “In the end, the issues I care about are those that are most important to the world we hand off to our children.”  He also addressed his potential to donate such a large sum, saying, “My contributions could be substantial, or not; and their party breakdown will depend on the candidates and policies.”  Bankman-Fried’s donation projections have been met with some skepticism. Journalist Jacob Silverman, for example, weighed in on Bankman-Fried’s thread, expressing concern about his lack of party alignment.  “For example, he said there are good ideas in both parties, but if he also cares about preserving democracy, will he donate to GOP politicians who reject election results?” tweeted Silverman.  Sam Bankman-Fried is scheduled to speak at Consensus 2022 in June.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who are both speaking at Consensus 2022 in June, have been at work for months on the bipartisan legislation, which they said they expect to make public in June – an unveiling that has slipped later and later over recent months. The two were speaking on a panel together on Tuesday at the DC Blockchain Summit.  “We are truly committed to creating the type of baseline and framework legislation that will allow this industry to grow, allow it to flourish,” said Gillibrand. “The best thing we can do for all these businesses is to bring clarity.”  The bill would lean on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the primary regulator for spot markets and futures, while leaving the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the supervisor of crypto the can be defined by the so-called Howey Test as securities – specifically, an asset that’s “being offered to fund a company in the same way stocks are offered to fund companies.” The legislation would also clarify that crypto mining would not be regulated under rules for broker-dealers.  The bill is still being drafted, but an “optimistic” Gillibrand said she expects to get Senate votes “next year at the latest.” It would have to clear four different committees, of which Gillibrand and Lummis are members of only two.  Lummis said an advantage of working on crypto legislation is that it’s not inherently partisan, though she said of writing this bill that “it’s so important we get it right the first time.”  Meanwhile, in a separate talk on Tuesday, recently sworn-in CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham said her agency already has enough authority to take a significant role in crypto oversight.  “The CFTC already has a framework that’s ready-made to go right now into the regulated sector for digital assets,” Pham said.

42411118,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gizUTp,1653422207,LUNA’s Ghost Haunts ‘Permissionless’ Crypto Conference,"WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. — One topic dominated the conversation at Blockworks’ Permissionless conference last week: Terra’s collapse.  After the death spiral of UST and LUNA wiped $40 billion from the books, many conference attendees were naturally preoccupied with where the contagion could spread, and who got rekt.  “I think the damage is pretty much done,” said Michael Tant, co-founder of the crypto venture capital firm Citizen X. “A lot of people got hit really hard but we don’t know the extent. There’s going to be a slow unwind of the impact over the next couple of months.“  CoinDesk spoke with a diverse group of conference attendees ranging from venture capitalists to project founders to crypto developers. Nearly all expressed worry about the Terra collapse and its various repercussions (market, regulatory, public opinion) for the industry.  “The yacht parties are going to be more subdued going forward,” said Vance Spencer, co-founder of the $1.5 billion crypto venture capital firm Framework Ventures.  “I spoke at my first conference in mid-2018 and recently went back to look at the list of speakers,” said Spencer. He said that “75% of those people are gone. You’re going to see a lot of people leave the space.”  But at Permissionless, the crypto crowds (and the yacht parties) were certainly still on display.  Terra rugged  As the conference approached, many ticket holders wondered what type of presence Terra, a lead sponsor, would have at Permissionless.  Throughout CoinDesk’s three-day attendance, Do Kwon and the Terra team were nowhere to be found.  “I’m not surprised,” one investor at the event told CoinDesk. “I doubt Do Kwon will ever set foot on U.S. soil again. Just look at what happened last time.”  Last September, at data firm Messari’s Mainnet conference in New York, Kwon was served by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with a subpoena before his onstage appearance.  A Wednesday panel on stablecoins that originally had Kwon as a headline speaker continued with MakerDAO lead developer Sam MacPherson replacing Kwon. MakerDAO is the platform behind DAI, the decentralized stablecoin that had been UST’s largest competitor.  “For a long time, there’s been debate between the two communities,” MakerDAO’s Luca Prosperi told CoinDesk. “Ultimately, the MakerDAO construct proved to be way more resilient, but it doesn’t give us pleasure because a lot of people lost a lot of money.”  In another instance, the opening day afterparty that was originally to be hosted by Terra was instead sponsored by Avalanche, another blockchain that partnered with Terra last month.  “The Terra people had all their swag shipped to the conference, they were supposed to be here with a booth,” one Permissionless sponsor told CoinDesk. “They came and picked it all up before the conference started because they didn’t want it to get meme’d on.”  What’s next?  CoinDesk spotted one attendee wearing a shirt emblazoned with the Terra logo. It was Terra developer Ivan Zundel, who said he had just flown from the Terra Hacker House in Chicago to attend the conference.  “There was a very solemn mood [at the hacker house],” Zundel told CoinDesk when asked about the vibe. “People didn’t feel that much motivation to build. Every day we were just looking at the price of LUNA dropping and UST de-pegging.”  “I’m not sure about the future of Terra,” continued Zundel. “But I think the ecosystem was good, the builders are good. The issue is, if nobody uses Terra, why would you build on it?”  CoinDesk also spoke with another algorithmic stablecoin project, USDN, the so-called Neutrino Dollar native to the Waves blockchain.  “USDN cannot death spiral the way UST/LUNA did,” said Coleman Maher, head of ecosystem at Waves Labs. “LUNA became hyperinflationary, while WAVES has a cap [on the minting].”  Maher told CoinDesk USDN is only backed by the token WAVES, and that he remained confident in the project. This year, WAVES surged over 300% to reach an all-time high of $62 this past March before falling to $5.46 as of Tuesday afternoon.  MakerDAO’s Prosperi says the stablecoin game is a patient one.  “From the outside, Maker has always been perceived as a slow-moving giant,” Prosperi told CoinDesk. “Innovation takes time, but we think for stablecoin providers, being prudent is very important. There is value in being very cautious in the way you innovate.”  Tightening the belt  For industry players, even those not directly impacted by LUNA’s collapse, the bearish market conditions seemed to have deflated crypto’s “easy money” environment.  “There used to be a really friendly environment with lots of $100-$200 million Series As,” said Framework’s Spencer. “I think that’s over. Now, if a project doesn’t have traction after their seed round, they’re not getting another check.”  Should prognostications of diminished venture capital interest ring true, founders could face a capital crunch in the ensuing months.  “Companies went into the new year with less than nine months of runway expecting to raise an up round to support their irresponsible burn rates,” said Bruno Faviero, co-founder of Magna, a token distribution platform. “Now they have to make tough decisions.”  A conference attendee from a project that was in the process of raising a round with venture capital firm Hashed told CoinDesk they were looking for a new firm to lead the round. CoinDesk previously reported that Hashed, a big investor in Terra, suffered $3.5 billion in losses from the debacle.  “I’m worried about some of the VCs that experienced huge losses that are now forced to sell down,” said Citizen X’s Tant. “Funds that got rekt will be looking to book profits or get liquidity from other projects in their portfolios.”  Other crypto players are more optimistic about a recovery, saying the current bear market will be less dreary than the “crypto winter” spanning late 2018 to early 2020.  “Institutions started to really shop crypto in the past 24 months,” said Felix Hartmann, founder of crypto investment firm Hartmann Capital. “The interesting thing is, they haven’t stopped. They’re not saying, ‘Whew, I dodged a bullet’ like they were in 2018.”  According to Hartmann, institutions are still interested in crypto despite the Terra fiasco. Additionally, the equities market doesn’t appear to be doing much better – another factor driving the institutional interest in crypto.  Quipped Hartmann: “If Target [TGT] dropped 25% a day, maybe crypto isn’t so bad.”  Crypto slowdown  Another important metric for the health of the industry is the inflow of developer talent – and there were at least anecdotal signs at Permissionless that this was also a variable affected by the market rout.  Previously, crypto broker Floating Point Group had a 100% acceptance rate of job offers over the last year, according to co-founder Kevin March.  However, since May 7, March said the firm has had several offer declines, with all of the declining candidates citing it was “not the right time to move into crypto,” according to the company’s post-interview feedback process.  “We had nearly a two-year perfect record,” March told CoinDesk. “We were founded in the 2018 crypto winter. We know this game – it’s time to build.”  Kevin Owocki, founder of the crypto grants organization Gitcoin, says that not all building in crypto is equal, and that the industry should be more focused on “positive-sum games.”  “It’s incumbent upon us to shift our attention and capital away from the latest decentralized casino and towards impact [decentralized autonomous organizations], projects that create positive externalities for the world,” Owocki told CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/24/lunas-ghost-haunts-permissionless-crypto-conference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2390e051d7550fad2aa375f034d07a51ab8dbf5-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We Checked His Record,"Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer of Guggenheim Investments, hasn't been shy over the past couple years about making predictions about the price of bitcoin (BTC).  His calls, typically made during interviews with financial media outlets including CNBC and Bloomberg, have garnered headlines thanks to his high-profile stature in traditional finance.  But a quick recap of some of his key prognostications shows just how mixed his track record has proven. (A media representative for Guggenheim didn't immediately return a call from CoinDesk seeking comment.)  December 2020  Minerd said bitcoin ""should be worth around $400,000.""  Bitcoin's price: about $20,000.  What happened next: Bitcoin climbed to just above $40,000 in January 2021.  February 2021  Minerd said bitcoin could go to $400,000 to $600,000 “if you consider the supply of bitcoin relative ... to the supply of gold in the world, and what the total value of gold is."" He added, however, that the cryptocurrency's rapid rise ""smacks of short-term speculation,"" and that the institutional levels of market participation, while growing, weren't yet big enough to support the price levels at the time.  Bitcoin's price: about $40,000.  What happened next: Bitcoin climbed to about $65,000 in April 2021.  June 2021  Minerd told CNBC that bitcoin could bottom out at $10,000 to $15,000 in its latest swoon.  Investors shouldn’t be “anxious to be putting money in bitcoin right now,"" Minerd said, adding that bitcoin could spend the next few years trading sideways before the market turned bullish again.  Bitcoin's price: about $35,500.  What happened next: The bitcoin price fell to as low $28,600 in the last several days of June but rallied over the next several months. By the end of September it was changing hands at around $44,000.  October 2021  Minerd said he was no longer invested in bitcoin.  ""When you don't understand what's happening, get out of the market,"" Minerd said in an interview with CNBC. ""So discipline tells me now I don't fully understand this.""  Bitcoin's price: around $63,000.  What happened next: Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high around $69,000 in November 2021 before retreating and then tumbling for the next few months. In January it fell as low as $32,950.  May 23, 2022  Minerd told CNBC bitcoin could fall to $8,000.  “When you break below $30,000 consistently, $8,000 is the ultimate bottom. So I think we have a lot more room to the downside, especially with the [U.S. Federal Reserve] being restrictive.”  Bitcoin's price: around $29,000.

42417150,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3kD,1653420432,What We Know So Far About SHIB: The Metaverse,"Shiba inu (SHIB) is, first and foremost, a meme coin. However, since its inception it has grown to launch an exchange, ShibaSwap, and is now adding extra utility with the Shiba Inu metaverse.  Specifically, SHIB holders can mint land plots in SHIB: The Metaverse. The project initially only supported payments in ether (ETH), but that situation has changed to avoid massive liquidations of SHIB across exchanges and trading platforms.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Metaverse Week  Users can mint four different types of plots, ranging from 0.2 ETH to 1 ETH in value. Users can use ETH or spend the equivalent value in SHIB to gain access to these land plots via the Shib.io platform.  It is worth noting that SHIB: The Metaverse will be built on Shibarium, an up-and-coming layer 2 scaling system for SHIB. Shibarium will receive a public test net in the next few months and will go through a public beta testing phase afterward. Once Shibarium goes live on the main network, all SHIB will be migrated there. Additionally, the new system will provide minimal transaction fees that will be ""near zero.""  How does SHIB: The Metaverse work?  SHIB: The Metaverse will feature 100,595 plots of land that will be minted by users, according to the people behind the Shiba Inu project. Landowners can generate passive income from their plots, collect in-game resources and generate rewards. Additionally, the developers plan to introduce a way to earn and ensure players have a personal space where they can build and manage their projects.  Read More: Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB): A Beginner’s Guide 2022  Not all of the lands are available to mint or purchase because some are locked as key locations for travel within the metaverse. Those lands will remain private and serve as common grounds, representing corridors between different parts of the metaverse.  SHIB: The Metaverse spans four different districts:  Growth District  Defense District  Technology District  Currencies District  In these districts, users can explore land plots ranging from Tier 1 to Tier 4. Tier 1 is the ""rarest"" of them all and has the fewest lands available. They are also the most expensive ones, as they cost 1 ETH – or its SHIB equivalent – to mint.  Read More: What Is ShibaSwap?  What can one do with shiba inu metaverse land?  Minting land in this metaverse is not the only utility for SHIB in the virtual world. Users can leverage SHIB to add pictures and logos to land plots. If those pictures change, the ecosystem will burn SHIB tokens.  Additionally, users can spend SHIB to name or rename land plots. Furthermore, SHIB is used to lease HUBS, which represents the most valuable land plots in the metaverse. There will be use cases for the LEASH and BONE currencies, too, as the development phases roll out.  Developers of SHIB: The Metaverse plan to offer creative ways to foster immersion and community, including strong partnerships and foundational resources.  How to mint land in SHIB: The Metaverse  The minting of land in SHIB: The Metaverse occurs through the Shib.io website. Users can see their reserved and acquired lands through the top menu, where they can also mint their land plots individually or in one transaction to avoid unnecessary gas fees.  To bid on or purchase SHIB lands, a user needs to set up a MetaMask wallet or a wallet compatible with WalletConnect and connect it to the Shib.io website.  Read More: How to Set up a MetaMask Wallet  As of writing, the sale has entered the Public Sale phase, meaning it is open to all and not just those who lock up LEASH or Shiboshis.  SHIB: The Metaverse management and key events  SHIB: The Metaverse is the brainchild of Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama and is supported by other Shiba Inu team members.  All funds collected from the land plot minting were to be used for future metaverse development when only ETH was supported. It is unclear if that approach will change now that SHIB is an accepted payment method.  The team initially deemed their ecosystem tokens to be a ""risk,"" as the team would need to sell SHIB to pay for project development. Although the team has not offered an official statement on that aspect, that may still happen.  A key event to expect is the upcoming finalization of a deal between SHIB: The Metaverse and an AAA game developer studio, which is still pending. If finalized, the game studio will handle artistic development while the Shiba Inu team focuses on the blockchain implementation aspects.

42421584,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeZ3,1653420340,"Bitcoin Is Apolitical, but Won't Be Much Longer","Ted Cruz, the Republican U.S. senator for Texas, said he wants the Lone Star State to be an “oasis on planet Earth for bitcoin [BTC] and crypto."" He said that, reiterating previous support for the state’s mining industry, during a keynote address at a Heritage Foundation event.  The Block reported that several speakers harshly criticized “the left side of the political aisle,” at this “Bitcoin and the American Experiment” conference. Cruz singled out Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat:  “Why does bitcoin make Elizabeth Warren toss and turn and twitch at night? Because she wants her sticky little socialist fingers to be able to control every penny in every one of our bank accounts.""  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Yet, bitcoin and the larger crypto industry could largely be described as an experiment with liberalism. That’s the ""lowercase l"" variety, or the political philosophy that takes an expansive view of individual rights and equality.  Open-source and open-access blockchains enable anyone to participate in or use the monetary, governmental and social tools built on top of them. Just as the U.S. Constitution codifies rules meant to foster the “consent of the governed and equality before the law,” crypto uses code to enforce similar rights.  Still, considering the particularities of this day and age, it seems increasingly that bitcoin belongs to the right, politically. That’s why we keep seeing politicians like Cruz calling for crypto “oases” and Warren for the industry to be tamped down.  It might seem disadvantageous for “the Left” to assume this position, considering how it shares the highest aims that crypto professes. Murtaza Hussain, a reporter at left-leaning publication The Intercept, recently wrote about “Liz Warren’s bitcoin blind spot,” noting that crypto could be a tool for financial inclusion to counter corporate power and mitigate governmental overreach.  “[A] future world of such currencies, in which bitcoin has been regulated out of existence by righteous progressives, will also be a world in which mass surveillance and social control is possible on a scale unprecedented in human history,” Hussain said, adding that the industry should not be above critique.  See also: The Privacy Boom Is Going to Change Everything  Crypto-holding political progressives often take a similar view that elected officials should participate in making this unique, emergent industry better for all – possibly through thoughtful regulation, supportive programs to expand blockchain use or education and constructive dialogue with industry leaders – rather than trying to quash it.  Part of a culture war  To some extent, that is happening (and it often happens across the aisle). However, I predict that as this industry grows and becomes more relevant to elections, partisan opinions about crypto will likely solidify around the thoughts professed by a few influential political leaders. The “culture war” between Republicans and Democrats seems unavoidable.  This is, of course, a travesty – just as it always is when political infighting prevents governmental action on issues where people (rather than elephants or donkeys, the symbols of the two largest U.S. political parties) should be the primary concern. It’s all the more upsetting considering there’s a convincing case that bitcoin, a non-state, private money, is above politics or even “apolitical.”  But it’s also a pragmatic view. In representative democracies like the U.S., citizens delegate responsibility over simple and tough issues to elected officials to write the rules and hire enforcers (regulators). Crypto is a particularly complex issue from which many people likely feel disconnected (a growing number hold these assets but that’s still a minority, and the technology is not yet widespread).  It’s well established why the political Left has concerns about crypto. These are primarily the same “narratives” in the mainstream discourse around crypto: its environmental impact, consumer safety issues and the negative sentiment around tax avoidance, wealth hoarding and capitalism generally.  As mentioned, there are many “progressive cases” for crypto, but it would be valuable to quickly say why crypto belongs to the Right. Both parties at times push for universalist agendas – there’s a populist argument for state-run health care, education and environmental action among the right and left.  Current and future impact  Crypto, in time, might impact various governmental concerns, including health care, voting and human rights, among other issues and so might be seen as another universalist project. But it’s important to think about the actual things it affects now. That is to say, money.  There are distinct political issues involving money – and therefore crypto – today. There’s the question about what to do with billionaires, the question of how to fairly levy taxes and the questions around how to best regulate markets. The Right and Left often diverge on these issues.  Crypto, as a financial technology, offers individuals strong protections over their wealth relating to how to spend it, save it and shield it. If leftists sometimes ask whether billionaires should exist, crypto presents a way to negate that question. How do you tax or confiscate wealth (ill-gotten gains or not) if you don’t have the keys?  The Right, broadly speaking, is also more favorable to free markets. Crypto, because of its censorship-resistant attributes, can support the most open markets: All participants can engage in economic activity as they see fit. This can range from capital formation to building markets around social media.  Regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and Securities and Exchange Commission – many rooted in the Progressive Era of U.S. history – operate from the position that unfettered capitalism causes social harm and must be overseen and contained.  Many crypto projects have their inception in a founder identifying some market inefficiency – sometimes the result of governmental or corporate interference – and offering a token to widen trade and rebalance the scales. This method hasn’t always been successful, as seen by the body count of failed initial coin offerings (ICO).  Crypto, like politics itself, is often future-oriented in that it presents a way to reach a radically different, potential world. The solution crypto offers is to expand individual authority over their economic activity (sometimes called “sovereignty” in the industry), hoping that the right combination of tools, money and people can collectively act for the better by doing right for themselves.  Progressives take a different approach. They may be concerned with fostering and maintaining individual rights, but the solutions they offer are through a stronger, more sovereign state. This is seen by observing the mandates on offer like enabling a well-endowed state to be the single competitor in the health care industry. Or enforcing rules that might make firms less competitive to support what’s called environmental or social justice.  This distinction is often why observers call crypto libertarian. None of this is to say that crypto cannot be put to use for even socialist aims, to use Cruz’s bugbear. Or that crypto cannot or will not be reincorporated into the state, as we’ve seen. Crypto has become a source for tax revenue and is not always as “non confiscatable” as sometimes claimed. That reality presents a tough question for the industry: What, then, is all this for?  Last week, bitcoin philosopher, erudite author and associate professor at Yale-NUS College Andrew M. Bailey wrote a Twitter thread outlining how the common belief that bitcoin “was borne from right wing or libertarian conspiracy theories” is incorrect. (Bailey, though ideological, is genuinely interested in ideas, loves debate and his research/book project, “Resistance Money,” with a number of similarly honest, self-declared progressive bitcoiners, is informative.)  Indeed, cryptocurrency shares a history and agenda with the radical, pro-privacy and civil rights cryptographers called the “cypherpunks.” These men and women non-conforming coders were staunchly anti-authoritarian, and “opposed institutional overreach (corporate and state alike)” by promoting the use of open source and open access technologies,” Bailey argued.  See also: Bitcoin and the Rise of the Cypherpunks | James Lopp  No disagreement there. However, although the cypherpunks and crypto offer apolitical solutions to state or corporate supremacy in digital realms, politicians are increasingly interested in crypto. Lines will be drawn, even if they shouldn’t be. And as a simple fact it’s clear how partisans – informed or ignorant of crypto’s history – will see crypto as fitting into their agenda or not. Crypto and progressives share many aims, but they differ radically in how to get there.  It’s fair to say that the industry, which is increasingly politically engaged, may be bringing this on itself. To give Bailey the last word, perhaps crypto should be a little less pragmatic and return to its intellectual roots.  “Digital authoritarianism – the use of computers to surveil and control – is on the rise. You needn't be on the right or left to see it,” Bailey said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/24/bitcoin-is-apolitical-but-wont-be-much-longer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e6d31b2e8cd6b30669c0d67307227c7fe7ed85e-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42417143,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3e1,1653419827,Exploring the Star Atlas Metaverse,"What is Star Atlas?  Star Atlas is a space-themed, multiplayer gaming metaverse based on the Solana blockchain. It was developed by Automata and allows players to “team up, organize, and fight their way into unknown territories,” its economic paper states.  Launching its first token generation event in August 2021, Star Atlas features in-game assets that embed the concept of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such that gamers possess complete ownership over and can generate income on their unique assets. Specifically, every item in Star Atlas is a NFT recorded on the blockchain.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Metaverse Week  Star Atlas has two tokens that drive all game operations: POLIS and ATLAS.  POLIS is the governance token with a market cap of $14 million and ATLAS is the payment token with a market cap of $18 million, according to data from CoinGecko.  Players buy ships, NFT-based space vehicles used to explore deep space, from the in-house marketplace to start the game. These spaceships with different details, crews and components are critical in a player’s capability to fight rival factions and discover assets scattered across the Star Atlas metaverse.  Star Atlas gameplay  According to game lore, the year is 2620 and there are three unique factions: MUD, Ustur and ONI.  The MUD Territory governed by humankind is known for their firepower; the Ustur Sector controlled by sentient androids is recognized for their hull strength; and the ONI Region, a consortium of alien races, is acknowledged for their diplomacy.  Read more: Michael Wagner: Building a Virtual Nation-State in the Metaverse  Gamers select one of the three factions, an irreversible decision for that particular wallet, and engage in the ongoing struggle of space exploration, territorial conquest and political domination occurring in Star Atlas.  The Star Atlas team releases its gameplay in modules, and the only available module to play is their mini-game, titled “SCORE - Tier 0.”  In SCORE, players can stake their assets and earn ATLAS by enlisting their spaceships to aid their faction’s side of the conflict.  After enlisting, players are supposed to keep their spaceships productive with enough fuel, ammunition, tool kits and food to keep their fleets fully functional.  Players can buy and sell in-game assets such as ships and resources in Star Atlas’s marketplace. USDC can be used as payment to exchange in-game goods, but ATLAS is the predominant currency within the NFT marketplace.  Most annoying feature?  In my experience, the most annoying feature of Star Atlas stems from the need for active management in resupplying ships.  While there were some times when I resupplied my spaceships without any issue, there were more times than I would like when I would try to resupply my ship and the transaction would fail, prompting me to try again.  Sometimes I would have to try several times over long periods of time to successfully resupply my one ship.  If players only had one ship, the resupplying process can be tolerable, but for others who have multiple ships in the fleet, resupplying may be extremely painful and cumbersome because players don’t have the option to resupply their entire fleet all at one time.  I went into Star Atlas’ discord channel to discuss my dilemma: The issue was commonly discussed among players there.  Multiple times a week, players would bring up issues of resupplying their ships in the Star Atlas Discord.  Read More: How to Get Started in The Sandbox  There is a community tool that offers one-click resupply, but the official Star Atlas team did not develop it and has only provided players with the capability to resupply one ship at a time.  Moreover, the issue of resupplying one’s ships tends to get exacerbated when Solana is experiencing congestion issues, and even worse, players cannot resupply or participate in the Star Atlas world when there is an outage on the Solana blockchain, which has happened multiple times.  On a tangent note, loading my Solana Phantom wallet with enough funds to participate was also annoying. Without SOL in my Phantom wallet, I as a player could not choose a faction since this initial action step requires a small SOL fee.  When I tried to send SOL from Coinbase to my Phantom wallet, Coinbase notified me saying, “Due to intermittent degraded performance on the external SOL network, send / receives may fail at elevated rates.” Just like resupplying my ship, it wasn’t until after I tried multiple times was I successful in depositing SOL in my Phantom wallet.  Biggest surprise?  I was most surprised about how the gameplay of Star Atlas’s SCORE only involved players buying ships, enlisting them to their faction’s fleet, earning ATLAS and resupplying ships with in-game resources because I typically don’t associate staking with gameplay.  Reflecting a similar sentiment in their SCORE guide, Star Atlas guild Aephia Industries, said, “Star Atlas is not yet a Play-2-Earn game, as there is not really much playing involved.”  Moreover, I initially thought the gameplay would be more than what it is currently because of three metrics: a roughly $32 million combined market cap of POLIS and ATLAS, a player base of more than 95,000 users and a cumulative total asset value of more than $105 million USDC for the three factions.  With millions of dollars and close to 100,000 players, I thought gameplay would be more extensive, and I was surprised to learn that the current gameplay was limited to just a mini-game.  While the market cap data of POLIS and ATLAS comes from CoinGecko, the other statistics are self-reported coming directly from Star Atlas’ faction page. Additionally, the metric for Star Atlas’ sizable player base does not detail if the number of players playing is for a given day, week, month or all time.  The future of the Star Atlas metaverse  To address the lack of extensive gameplay, the Star Atlas team on May 13 announced its next major browser gameplay module, SCREAM, an acronym that stands for “ship configuration, resource extraction and missions.”  SCREAM “will be the first time players can use their ships to fight for the future of their faction with fun, active, repeatable, on-chain gameplay with earning potential,” said Star Atlas’ recent issue. “Our features will execute and resolve on the blockchain, from attacking starbases to harvesting resources, even the location of your fleets,” the team added.  While players in SCORE are rewarded for enlisting their ships to their faction’s fleet, players in SCREAM will be rewarded in proportion to the value that they generated for their faction via their actions in war and battles.  When SCREAM is launched in a few months, SCORE will slowly be discontinued, said Aephia Industries.  Best feature?  Star Atlas’s best feature is its community.  The Star Atlas community on Discord has more than 172,000 members where someone at almost any time of day is willing to chat, while its Twitter account has more than 300,000 followers where thousands of people consistently join their Twitter Spaces, such as the one on May 20.  More than just receiving technical support every time I needed help navigating through Star Atlas, I experienced an inclusive community where players made it easy to feel a sense of belonging within the overall Star Atlas community.  Each time someone responded to my questions about gameplay, alleviating my troubles, I was grateful someone cared enough to help me learn how to play the game correctly.  It also helps that the official Star Atlas team releases updates on their medium page to facilitate communal engagement and support.  Official gameplay has not been released and yet its players are still hanging around, whether it’s in the game, Discord or Twitter.  Community is the heart and soul of legitimate Web 3 organizations, and because of the demonstrated care Star Atlas community members displayed, it is easy to recognize how they are Star Atlas’ best feature.  Overall, Star Atlas was not my favorite game to play currently due to the limited gameplay and trouble I had resupplying my ships. Despite that, it was nice to be a part of the Star Atlas community, and so I am interested in seeing how Star Atlas unfolds in the upcoming future.

42423256,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XlRh,1653417082,Argentinian Crypto Exchange Buenbit Cuts 45% of Staff Due to Tech Industry Downturn,"Argentina-based cryptocurrency exchange Buenbit has laid off 45% of its staff, the company told CoinDesk on Monday.  According to the company, the team now consists of 100 people across its operations in Argentina, Mexico and Peru. The company declined to specify how many people it laid off, but based on the math, a 45% cut would imply that about 80 people were cut.  Buenbit’s CEO Federico Ogue said in a Twitter thread on Monday that the decision was made due to the “global overhaul” the tech industry has entered, adding that the reduction plan, which the company has been working on for months, was not linked to the recent crash of UST and Luna. In July 2021, Buenbit said it had 400,000 customers.  Ogue said Buenbit will now focus exclusively on its existing operations in Argentina, Mexico and Peru, and put its expansion plans on hold (Ogue told CoinDesk in 2021 that Buenbit was considering starting operations in Colombia and Brazil). It will also work to “maintain a self-sustaining and efficient structure.”  Last July, Buenbit raised $11 million in a Series A funding round led by Libertus Capital, in which Galaxy Digital, FJ Labs and Amaiya Management also participated.  In March, the company had added the option for users to acquire UST and said they could “receive a return of up to 18%” via staking.  The company had initially planned to raise funds within a year after the Series A, Ogue said last year, and was considering making acquisitions to accelerate growth.  Matias Nisenson, a venture capitalist who had invested in Buenbit, said on Twitter on Monday that startups such like Buenbit may have had plans to raise more capital to continue growing, but that they are facing a changing macro environment and investors who are more risk-averse.  According to Nisenson, Buenbit had two options. The first is “I stay as I am, and I pray that someone will give me capital to continue to sustain my structure. This option includes a big chance of melting down and having to lay off 100% of my team.”  The second option, Nisenseon said, was “I do what I need to do to make my company sustainable without outside capital, even if it means laying off 50% of my team today.

42417154,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3rR,1653416751,How Do You Value Metaverse Projects? We Tried. Here’s What We Found,"The metaverse is probably overvalued.  We’ve seen funding in metaverse companies balloon to $12.1 billion in 2021 from $5.9 billion in 2020, according to Crunchbase. It’s hard to say if valuations are lofty even if most projects don’t have a working product. The companies and projects that garner funding are getting that funding based on potential.  Determining if that potential is overvalued is not easy, but we can try. We can take valuation techniques from traditional finance and adapt them for these metaverse companies in a way that could show us that maybe (just maybe), your favorite metaverse project is overvalued, fairly valued or even undervalued.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Metaverse Week.  How are companies traditionally valued?  When a company is purchased, the most important deal point is valuation. And it’s not particularly close. How much does Alice need to pay Bob for Bob’s company? Doesn’t matter how favorable other terms (method of payment, closing conditions, breakup fees, etc.) are, you couldn’t purchase the family business from the Cargills for $100 million.  Generalizing even further, price is the most important deal point for any financial transaction. For initial public offerings, follow-on equity offerings, leveraged loans, corporate bonds, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, Series A rounds and even your daily cup of coffee – price is paramount. What’s more, negotiating a favorable valuation is one of investment banks’ main services.  Read More: Metaverse Real Estate – Next Big Thing or Next Big Boondoggle?  In those negotiations, bankers from both sides present endless data points that support proposed valuations. Usually valuation is presented in terms of a multiple of sales, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), book value (the excess value of balance sheet assets less liabilities) or precedent transactions (what your local real estate agent would call “comps”). Sometimes bankers even use the academic’s favorite: the discounted cash flow, which is supposed to estimate the value of an investment based on expected future cash flows. (What’s usually conveniently left out is that a managing director massaged inputs to get the final number where they wanted it.)  That’s fine and dandy, but this is crypto, and this is Metaverse Week. How do these old chestnuts apply in the world of metaverse investment? Does any of it apply? How much should investors pay for these metaverse projects?  So how do you value a metaverse project or token?  Unlike traditional finance, there’s no tried-and-true method to apply here or a managing director who can tell me what to do. With the endless, paralyzing possibilities I settled on looking at one main metric.  Users.  Why users? For all its incoherent technobabble, the Web 3/metaverse crowd and thought leaders have made it abundantly clear that they are doing … whatever this is … for the users. The metaverse can mean many different things depending on whom you ask. It’s either gaming, augmented reality, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or some combination. For simplicity, we are going to dive into these three crypto-focused metaverse projects: Decentraland, Axie Infinity and The Sandbox.  Fortunately for data junkies, we have a surplus of data that we can aggregate over time periods so granular it would make a career CFO’s head spin. If you wanted to look at user data and compare it to the market capitalization day by day, you could. So we will.  The following charts show the ratio of market capitalization of a project’s native token to the number of users on the platform over the trailing one-year period.  As a general observation, I was initially taken aback by a few things.  First, I expected the market capitalization per annualized user curve to look exactly the opposite. I expected that valuations would be bloated in the early stages of the ecosystem, given sky-high valuations and low user counts, and then eventually come down as more users came in.  Second, the shape of the Decentraland and The Sandbox charts looked eerily similar (aside from the user spikes in the The Sandbox chart), as if one were drawn from memory of the other. These two projects, however, are viewed somewhat as substitute products, like Coca-Cola and Pepsi, so perhaps that isn’t quite so surprising.  Read More: How to Invest in the Metaverse  Lastly, Axie Infinity had far more users than either Decentraland or The Sandbox, but its market capitalization per user multiple was far lower. Granted, Axie Infinity is a play-to-earn game rather than a “decentralized metaverse” but the contrast was still striking.  Disclaimer: The answer to ‘What does this mean?’ might be ‘nothing’  It’s worth noting that this valuation technique might be suspect, a nothingburger rooted in quicksand. Using a project’s annualized user count and comparing it to its market capitalization was an attempt to determine how much value the market was ascribing per user on each platform. From there, someone could look at this metric across projects and look at relative valuations and determine if something is deserving of the valuation the market is giving it. This could provide a pivot point for comparative purposes, but there’s nothing guaranteeing that it is the correct pivot point.  This valuation technique is also rife with assumptions. The metric assumes (a) that the market knows what it’s doing and (b) that these projects should have any value at all. It also doesn’t take into consideration the possibility that the same individuals could have multiple accounts on a platform, which would overstate the user count. The assumption here is also that this is the right usage metric to look at; perhaps it is more fitting to look at transactions on the platform (which were not much different than users, for the record, but at least those are unique; see below for Decentraland per-transaction data). Maybe it was more appropriate to look at something more nuanced that I failed to uncover.  Lastly, I also admit to my own personal skepticism in the metaverse in general. I wouldn’t call myself a metaverse believer, so there’s a chance some of my preconceptions nudged the analysis toward more unflattering metrics. Strengthening my skepticism is the following very rough math and equivalence: Twitter, an app beloved by crypto natives, boasts over 200 million daily active users. Twitter’s market capitalization is around $29 billion as of May 23, 2022. If we apply the lowest market capitalization per annualized user presented in any of these charts (Axie Infinity, $118 per user) that would imply a more than $8.5 trillion valuation for Twitter.  Call me skeptical, but that number seems quite high.

However, one researcher sees the potential for even more downside.  Josh Olszewicz, head of research at investment manager Valkyrie, says volatility will need to settle down in order for bitcoin’s price to establish a foothold at the bottom anytime in the near term.  “We can look at things like the 200-week moving average, which is around $22,000. We can look at realized price, which is the average price of coins that have moved on-chain, which is around $23,800,” Olszewicz said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program. “This [movement to hit bottom] will probably take at least all of Q3, perhaps Q4 as well, if it were to happen this year.”  Olszewicz said other factors, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates, are also playing a role in bitcoin’s market performance.  He postulated that institutional investors could be leading the downturn. Olszewicz cited the average size of on-chain movements being in the tens of thousands of BTC.  “A majority of volume is certainly led by institutional-size flows,” he said.  Nonetheless, Olszewicz said market movement continues to depend more on retail traders than institutional investors. He sees those who are learning about cryptocurrencies now diving in during this bear market to test the waters and to “see if they can survive.”  “We’ve seen this rise and swell before, and as individuals again learn about bitcoin for the first time, the cycle could repeat,” Olszewicz said. “Since 2018, the average number of bitcoin-holding wallets has increased from over 27 million to more than 41 million today.”  He added, “We're seeing a lot of people not only staying here, but getting excited again about what's going on in the space.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/24/more-downside-ahead-for-bitcoin-says-top-valkyrie-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1eb0dc435429ac3828a21a8c434f7a894049a746-2048x1130.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It is worth noting that all stocks and crypto values have plummeted recently. The feat doesn&apos;t take away the fact that Bitcoin&apos;s price has been a roller coaster. Yet, the pioneer crypto lacks an intrinsic value. A mind-boggling fact, the first question to pop is why do they have value then? Read on to understand more about the issue. What is Intrinsic Value First things first, just what is meant by intrinsic value? The phrase refers to the fundamental and objective value possessed by an object. It should come naturally, notwithstanding any other external additives. A good example of a day-to-day product with an intrinsic value is salt. The value of salt is derived from its salty taste. When looking at an object used as a store of value, one naturally attaches value to gold because of its glittery nature and metallic qualities. Its huge costs of extraction, high scarcity level, and the prestige attached to owning it drive its price further. A product with intrinsic value will normally not be sold at a price far above the cost of its sum inputs. A loaf of bread is priced at a cost that is not far above its cost of production. That is the value of its ingredients like wheat, water, sugar, salt, the labor used, rent, distribution costs, and any others. The difference is the profit for the producer.

42374660,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1pQJ,1653403661,Miladys NFT Prices Tumble After Creator Doxxes Self as Person Behind Controversial 'Miya',"Minimum prices for the popular non-fungible token (NFT) collection “Milady Maker” have slumped nearly 70% in the past week amid drama that revealed its creator to have been a controversial personality linked to a popular online cult.  Miladys sell for a floor price of 0.26 ether (ETH), about $511 at writing time, compared with all-time highs of over $6,000 in April, data from tracking tools show. Trading volumes have fallen 57% in the past 24 hours, while one Milady sold for as low as 0.037 ETH in the past week.  Floor prices of other popular collections, such as CryptoPunks or the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), changed nominally over the past week, suggesting Milady’s plunge is an isolated incident unrelated to the broader NFT market.  Last week, the pseudonymous decentralized finance (DeFi) developer 0xngmi alleged that Charlotte Fang, Milady’s creator, was “Miya” – a pseudonymous online entity that allegedly spread hatred against Blacks, homosexuals and Jews.  0xngmi has compiled their findings on GitHub.  There were unconfirmed reports on Twitter that accounts related to Miya apparently urged young girls toward being anorexic and that the persona was involved in ""systemspace,"" an alleged online cult popular on bulletin site 4chan.  Fang came clean over the weekend in a tweet. “Full disclosure: I was Miya. And its toxic baggage that’s hurting Milady community & poisoning the vibe. I apologize about trying to hide the past account,” Fang wrote.  In a tweet thread, Fang wrote the Miya profile had “nothing to do with” the Milady Maker and added: “Unequivocally, my real views hold no room for hate, and I detest abusers & groomers – trolling about it was juvenile, but in reality I’ve never harmed a fly.”  Meanwhile, some prominent investors in the space suggested that Fang’s past experience may have influenced the look of the Milady project:  “This is freaking gross,"" said DeFiance Capital founder Arthur Cheong. ""Can understand the aesthetic style of Milady now given founder's history.”  The collection of over 10,000 anime-inspired, regenerative avatars has previously landed in controversy. Some of the avatars in a spin-off collection (“Milady, That B.I.T.C.H.”) were wearing shirts bearing the word “Treblinka” – a Nazi concentration camp, as previously reported.  The claims were, however, dispelled by creators who insisted the term was randomly generated by a computer.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/24/milady-nft-prices-tumble-after-creator-doxxes-self-as-person-behind-controversial-miya,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6020229c2da8c5772ef197d7c443287a3ab018c6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411794,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzy7,1653403383,How to Transfer NFTs Between Wallets,"If you own or are given a non-fungible token (NFT), you may want to transfer that NFT from one crypto wallet to another, whether it's for trading purposes or just because you want a different type of digital asset. We’ll take you through the process in this simple how-to guide.  Transferring NFTs from one wallet to another  Wallets such as Metamask and Solana's Phantom Wallet are popular among NFT holders. Regardless of what wallet or NFT marketplace you prefer, there are generally five steps you need to take to move an NFT from one digital wallet to another:  Toggle to your NFTs tab showing all the NFTs in your wallet.  Select the NFT to transfer.  Click the ""Send"" button.  Input the recipient's public address (or ENS).  Confirm the transaction.  The steps are likely to be similar across wallets and will allow you to safely send your NFT to the correct recipient.  To get more specific, we’re going to take you through two common use cases, transferring an NFT from your OpenSea account to a MetaMask wallet, and transferring an NFT into the Phantom Wallet. These are two common wallets and frequently used in the NFT world.  One thing we want to call out about step 4 above and in all following guides: You must ensure that the public wallet address you are sending to is correct. If you mistype or otherwise incorrectly enter the public address, the NFT will be transferred, permanently, to that mistaken address and there is no way to retrieve it.  Sending an NFT from OpenSea to MetaMask  The following are the steps that must be taken to transfer the NFT from OpenSea to MetaMask using Google Chrome:  1. To send an NFT from OpenSea to a MetaMask wallet, you must first sign in to the OpenSea platform and select the NFT you want to send.     2. Choose the NFT you wish to send.     3. You will be asked for the public wallet address to which you want to send it.     4. Then you have to agree to pay the fee for the transfer by pressing “Confirm.”     OpenSea will move your NFT to a MetaMask wallet after paying the fee.  Sending an NFT to the Phantom Wallet  The Phantom Wallet is designed for assets compatible with the Solana blockchain. For those looking to transfer some of their NFTs over to this user-friendly wallet, they can do so by following these steps:  1. Go to your Phantom wallet and press the ""NFT Collectibles"" button.     2. Select an NFT to send.     3. You will need to input the public wallet address of the recipient to complete the NFT transfer.     4. You will need to accept paying the network fee by pressing “Send.”     NFTs are exciting assets to collect, and it's great that there is a way to do so within the crypto sphere. With that being said, the process can seem confusing and difficult for someone who hasn't spent a lot of time in this space. But once you’ve gone through the process a few times, it will become much easier to manage your NFTs, connect your wallets, send tokens and transfer assets between them.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | SOL | TRADING | WALLET,Mike Antolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-transfer-nfts-between-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2171a24efbb5708968f6540ee61e5e801ed1899-3644x2733.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The industry makes it easier to explore the traditional financial system and implement new investment concepts such as synthetic crypto assets. By definition, synthetic assets refer to a combination of assets that possess the same value as another asset. Synthetics mainly act as derivatives, assets that obtain value from other underlying assets like stocks or securities. Crypto synthetic assets, therefore, adopt a similar approach since they are tokenized derivatives imitating the value of another asset. Interested parties can invest in any asset through crypto synths without moving out of the crypto ecosystem. How Crypto Synthetics Work As mentioned earlier, synths allow users to own tokenized derivatives. The idea behind tokenization is to digitize an asset on a blockchain network. Hence, owning the tokenized synthetic asset will be similar to holding the actual asset. For instance, investors may be interested in trading Tesla stocks without holding the TSLA asset. In this case, users can opt to trade a synthetic TSLA which acts as the actual asset. Blockchains play a vital role in the crypto synthetic market. The network&apos;s underlying technology makes synthetic assets legitimate through digital certificates or tokens. Having a digital token or certificate proves that an investor owns the respective real-world asset.

Crypto was on the agenda at a National Assembly emergency seminar this week. A two-day-long meeting was designed to discuss the disaster involving the Terra stablecoin UST and its sister token LUNA, which both collapsed to near zero earlier this month.  ""We need to make exchanges play their proper role, and toward that end it is crucial for watchdogs to supervise them thoroughly,"" Rep. Sung Il-jong of the ruling People Power Party said. ""When exchanges violate rules, they should be held legally responsible to ensure that the market functions well without any troubles.""  Around 280,000 South Koreans are believed to have been victims of the abrupt plunge in UST and LUNA's values, according to the Korea Times.  The country's Financial Services Commission plans to build close ties with law enforcers ""to monitor any illegal acts in the industry and protect investors' rights,"" said its vice chair, Kim So-young.  Authorities are also looking into whether Do Kwon, the CEO of Terra creator Terraform Labs and a citizen of South Korea, has perpetrated fraud in targeting investors with his crypto project.  Cryptocurrency has been prominent in political discussion in South Korea in recent months, with both candidates in March's presidential election taking crypto-friendly stances in order to appeal to younger voters.

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price point: Bitcoin and ether trade down as Tron's TRX trades in the green.  Market Moves: Despite recent price action, bitcoin hodlers remain pretty unfazed: Data shows the number of addresses holding >1 year is at an all-time high.  Feature: From DAVOS: Cryptocurrencies have taken a prominent role at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, despite the mainstream finance world's apparent contempt for the sector.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was down 3.9% on the day, between $28,000 and $30,000.  Ethereum was down 4.8% on the day, around $1,900.  Altcoins mostly lost ground overnight with Fantom’s FTM marking the biggest loss amongst the top 20 coins. Over the last 24 hours FTM is down 13.7%.  Tron, a multi-purpose smart contract blockchain, was one of the only gainers today. Its TRX token is up 6% on the day and is up 12% over the last seven days. The platform's price uptick comes as it announced a $10 million incentive fund to support Terra developers migrating to the Tron ecosystem.  In traditional markets, stocks and futures declined. Dow Jones futures dropped 0.6%, while S&P 500 futures lost 1%. The U.S. dollar was little changed. The euro rose to a one-month high ($1.07) after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said interest rates in the eurozone will likely be in positive territory by the end of the third quarter.  Market Moves  Despite the crypto market's recent price action, bitcoin hodlers have remained pretty unfazed as the number of addresses holding less than one year is at an all-time high.  According to data from IntoTheBlock, there are now 27.65 million addresses holding bitcoin for more than one year, or some 12.66 million BTC.  Bitcoin's stock-to-flow ratio  The stock-to-flow model (SF), popularized by a pseudonymous Dutch institutional investor who operates under the Twitter account “PlanB,” is a forecasting tool some investors use for bitcoin price.  The model considers BTC's circulating supply (stock) against its expected production of new supply (flow) to get a stock-to-flow ratio; a high ratio implies that a commodity is growing increasingly scarce and is more valuable.  According to data from Kraken Intelligence, by overlaying BTC's price against its stock-to-flow ratio BTC's price has trended alongside the ratio over the years.  “BTC's price continues to diverge less and less from its ratio, which is a 365-day average; when price trends above the stock-to-flow ratio, the divergence is positive (>1), and thus BTC may be considered overbought,” said Kraken Intelligence in its weekly report.  The multi-colored line denotes the number of days until Bitcoin's next halving, which is when the mining reward for a new block cuts in half. This reduction in new coins (flow) drives BTC's ratio higher, implying BTC is more scarce and valuable, according to Kraken.  Bitcoin’s next halving is 705 days away. The block subsidy will fall from 6.25 to 3.125 per block.  It is worth noting the SF model relies heavily on the assumption that the scarcity of the cryptocurrency should drive value, which might not always be the case. That's especially true because of the notoriously volatile short-term swings in the bitcoin price.

Feature: At Davos, Crypto Is No Longer on the Outside  By Sandali Handagama, Helene Braun  DAVOS, Switzerland — Even on the trains, you can’t get away from crypto.  The World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting – canceled in 2021, delayed earlier in 2022 – formally kicks off Tuesday in Davos, Switzerland. Cryptocurrency advocates opened the parties up on Sunday with bitcoin pizza stalls and blockchain pavilions with flashy banners lining the famed promenade.  WEF attendees were bombarded with signs advertising stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto brokerage Bitcoin Suisse as they got off their planes in Zurich or trains in Davos. Casual passers-by talked about owning shiba inu (SHIB) and ADA. At the end of the day, the crypteratti dispersed to one of the nearby AirBnBs.  “Five years ago, we were the only crypto company on Promenade,” said Sandra Ro, CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC) at a kickoff party at a local church (dubbed “The Sanctuary”) right outside the closed-off conference venue. “And look at it now,” she added.  Perhaps nothing announced the turbulent crypto industry's arrival at the world's biggest business table more than the fact that the WEF itself is holding serious discussions about digital money, with industry participants as key players.  Jeremy Allaire, chairman and CEO at Circle Pay and Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, sat side by side on Monday to discuss remittances and digital money at an issue briefing at the WEF media village. The panel, titled ""Remittances for Recovery: A New Era of Digital Money,"" also included Asif Saleh, executive director of the BRAC, a developmental non-governmental organization based in Bangladesh.  The forum also hosted a discussion on the future of the global economy, the U.S. economy and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) themselves. That’s not to say the forum’s global leaders accept cryptocurrencies just yet – but they aren’t ignoring it.

42411783,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzNk,1653400752,What Is DeFi?,"DeFi is short for “decentralized finance,” an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain geared toward disrupting financial intermediaries.  DeFi draws inspiration from blockchain, the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, which allows several entities to hold a copy of a history of transactions, meaning it isn’t controlled by a single, central source. That’s important because centralized systems and human gatekeepers can limit the speed and sophistication of transactions while offering users less direct control over their money. DeFi is distinct because it expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial use cases.  Read more: What Is a Decentralized Application?  Bitcoin and many other digital-native assets stand out from legacy digital payment methods, such as those run by Visa and PayPal, in that they remove all middlemen from transactions. When you pay with a credit card for coffee at a cafe, a financial institution sits between you and the business, with control over the transaction, retaining the authority to stop or pause it and record it in its private ledger. With cryptocurrency, those institutions are cut out of the picture.  Direct purchases aren’t the only type of transaction or contract overseen by big companies; financial applications such as loans, insurance, crowdfunding, derivatives, betting and more are also in their control. Cutting out middlemen from all kinds of transactions is one of the primary advantages of decentralized finance.  Before it was commonly known as decentralized finance, the idea of DeFi was often called ""open finance.""  Ethereum applications  Most decentralized finance applications are built on top of Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency platform, which sets itself apart from the Bitcoin platform in that it’s easier to use to build other types of decentralized applications beyond simple transactions. These more complex financial use cases were even highlighted by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin back in 2013 in the original Ethereum white paper.  That’s because of Ethereum’s platform for smart contracts – which automatically execute transactions if certain conditions are met – offers much more flexibility. Ethereum programming languages, such as Solidity, are specifically designed for creating and deploying such smart contracts.  For example, say a user wants his or her money to be sent to a friend next Tuesday, but only if the temperature climbs above 90 degrees Fahrenheit according to weather.com. Such rules can be written in a smart contract.  With smart contracts at the core, dozens of DeFi applications are operating on Ethereum, some of which are explored below. Ethereum 2.0, a coming upgrade to Ethereum’s underlying network, could give these apps a boost by chipping away at Ethereum’s scalability issues.  The most popular types of DeFi applications include:  Decentralized exchanges (DEXs): Online exchanges help users exchange currencies for other currencies, whether U.S. dollars for bitcoin or ether for DAI. DEXs are a hot type of exchange, which connects users directly so they can trade cryptocurrencies with one another without trusting an intermediary with their money.  Stablecoins: A cryptocurrency that's tied to an asset outside of cryptocurrency (the dollar or euro, for example) to stabilize the price.  Lending platforms: These platforms use smart contracts to replace intermediaries such as banks that manage lending in the middle.  ""Wrapped"" bitcoins (WBTC): A way of sending bitcoin to the Ethereum network so the bitcoin can be used directly in Ethereum's DeFi system. WBTCs allow users to earn interest on the bitcoin they lend out via the decentralized lending platforms described above.  Prediction markets: Markets for betting on the outcome of future events, such as elections. The goal of DeFi versions of prediction markets is to offer the same functionality but without intermediaries.  Read more:Centralized Exchange (CEX) vs. Decentralized Exchange (DEX): What’s the Difference?  In addition to these apps, new DeFi concepts have sprung up around them:  Yield farming: For knowledgeable traders who are willing to take on risk, there's yield farming, where users scan through various DeFi tokens in search of opportunities for larger returns.  Liquidity mining: When DeFi applications entice users to their platform by giving them free tokens. This has been the buzziest form of yield farming yet.  Composability: DeFi apps are open source, meaning the code behind them is public for anyone to view. As such, these apps can be used to ""compose"" new apps with the code as building blocks.  Money legos: Putting the concept ""composability"" another way, DeFi apps are like Legos, the toy blocks children click together to construct buildings, vehicles and so on. DeFi apps can be similarly snapped together like ""money legos"" to build new financial products.  Lending platforms  Lending markets are one popular form of decentralized finance, which connects borrowers to lenders of cryptocurrencies. One popular platform, Compound, allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies or offer their own loans. Users can make money off of interest for lending out their money. Compound sets the interest rates algorithmically, so if there's higher demand to borrow a cryptocurrency, the interest rates will be pushed higher.  DeFi lending is collateral-based, meaning in order to take out a loan, a user needs to put up collateral – often ether, the token that powers Ethereum. That means users don't give out their identity or associated credit score to take out a loan, which is how normal, non-DeFi loans operate.  Stablecoins  Another form of DeFi is the stablecoin. Cryptocurrencies often experience sharper price fluctuations than fiat, which isn't a good quality for people who want to know how much their money will be worth a week from now. Stablecoins peg cryptocurrencies to non-cryptocurrencies, such as the U.S. dollar, in order to keep the price under control. As the name implies, stablecoins aim to bring price ""stability.""  Notable stablecoins include:  Tether (USDT)  USD Coin (USDC)  Binance USD (BUSD)  Dai (DAI)  Prediction markets  One of the oldest DeFi applications living on Ethereum is a so-called ""prediction market,"" where users bet on the outcome of some event, such as ""Will Donald Trump win the 2020 presidential election?""  The goal of the participants is, obviously, to make money, though prediction markets can sometimes better predict outcomes than conventional methods, like polling. Centralized prediction markets with good track records in this regard include Intrade and PredictIt. DeFi has the potential to boost interest in prediction markets, since they are traditionally frowned upon by governments and often shut down when run in a centralized manner.  Decentralized Finance FAQ  How do I make money with DeFi?  The value locked up in Ethereum DeFi projects has been exploding, with many users reportedly making a lot of money.  Using Ethereum-based lending apps, as mentioned above, users can generate ""passive income"" by loaning out their money and generating interest from the loans. Yield farming, described above, has the potential for even larger returns, but with larger risk. It allows for users to leverage the lending aspect of DeFi to put their crypto assets to work generating the best possible returns. However, these systems tend to be complex and often lack transparency.  Is investing in DeFi safe?  No, it's risky. Many believe DeFi is the future of finance and that investing in the disruptive technology early could lead to massive gains.  But it's difficult for newcomers to separate the good projects from the bad. And, there has been plenty of bad.  As decentralized finance has increased in activity and popularity through 2020, many DeFi applications, such as meme coin YAM, have crashed and burned, sending the market capitalization from $60 million to $0 in 35 minutes. Other DeFi projects, including Hotdog and Pizza, faced the same fate, and many investors lost a lot of money.  In addition, DeFi bugs are unfortunately still very common. Smart contracts are powerful, but they can't be changed once the rules are baked into the protocol, which often makes bugs permanent and thus increasing risk.  When will DeFi go mainstream?  While more and more people are being drawn to these DeFi applications, it's hard to say where they’ll go. Much of that depends on who finds them useful and why. Many believe various DeFi projects have the potential to become the next Robinhood, drawing in hordes of new users by making financial applications more inclusive and open to those who don't traditionally have access to such platforms.  This financial technology is new, experimental and isn't without problems, especially with regard to security or scalability.  Developers hope to eventually rectify these problems. Ethereum 2.0 could tackle scalability concerns through a concept known as sharding, a way of splitting the underlying database into smaller pieces that are more manageable for individual users to run.  How will Ethereum 2.0 impact DeFi?  Ethereum 2.0 isn't a panacea for all of DeFi’s issues, but it's a start. Other protocols such as Raiden and TrueBit are also in the works to further tackle Ethereum's scalability issues.  If and when these solutions fall into place, Ethereum's DeFi experiments will have an even better chance of becoming real products, potentially even going mainstream.  Bitcoin as DeFi  While Ethereum is top dog in the decentralized finance world, many proponents of Bitcoin share the goal of cutting the middleman out of more complex financial transactions, and they’ve developed ways to do so using the Bitcoin protocol.  Companies such as DG Labs and Suredbits, for instance, are working on a Bitcoin DeFi technology called discreet log contracts (DLC). DLC offers a way to execute more complex financial contracts, such as derivatives, with the help of Bitcoin. One use case of DLC is to pay out bitcoin to someone only if certain future conditions are met, say, if the Chicago White Sox team win its next baseball game, the money will be dispensed to the winner.

42421576,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeVx,1653400419,Living as NFTs in the Metaverse,"The metaverse isn’t just about making realistic virtual experiences, but in enabling hyperreal ones. This is the process of creating personalized content based on data, or the things people do and say and what that reveals about them.  In some sense, the hyperreal isn’t just a goal but potentially a necessary end state of the metaverse. Scaling immersive digital experiences to billions of people will only be possible when content creation is automated with artificial intelligence (AI). Hyperreality happens when we interact with photo-realistic digital content that looks exactly like real life – it is so immersive that the distinction between ""real"" and ""digital"" is less important than the experience itself. In this way, hyperreality is an extension of reality not just a lower resolution ""digital version.""  Tom Graham is CEO and co-founder of Metaphysic a well as the developer of Every Anyone, an AI platform for creating NFT-based hyperreal avatars and metaverse data management. This article is part of ""Metaverse Week.""  The ways AI can use biometric face and voice data – and our revealed preferences in that data – won’t just recreate our favorite physical environments online but transform them. In this scenario, it’s essentially that we build tools that help regain control of our digital lives and experiences.  The metaverse promises that everything from work meetings to parent teacher interviews will take place in photo-realistic virtual worlds that look exactly like our homes, schools and offices. We’ll interact with each other as embodied photo-realistic avatars. There will also be game worlds and fictional universes – we can be whoever or whatever we want.  As this hyperreal metaverse emerges and as our avatars blend seamlessly with who we are in real life, it is necessary we maintain control. We need to safeguard our identities and own the deeply personal biometric data used by AI models to build and animate our life-like avatars.  Indeed, Web 3 adds a user-centric ownership layer onto the existing “read/write” internet. Non-fungible tokens (NFT) will play a critical role in enabling more realistic forms of participation in content and lead to the creation of new digital economies. Ultimately, the Web 3 internet will become “read/write/own.” NFTs and blockchain technologies are essential elements of the tech stack that will empower regular people to create and own their own hyperreal synthetic avatars in the metaverse.  In the future, every person will have an NFT in their wallet that links to their sensitive biometric data that is stored offline. These NFTs will provide the basis for our persistent virtual identities. We’ll log in to experiences like “3D Immersive Zoom” and “Hyperreal FIFA 2025” using our wallets, just like how we use “Sign in with Google” today.  However, this is a radical departure from the relationship people have with their data in Web 2 paradigms. Blockchain will enable users to verify their real world identity, control access to their biometric data and consent to how they are rendered in hyperreal content.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Opinion  This also allows us to directly participate in a new wave of virtual economies. For example, we will be able to track our participation in virtual events and be compensated for both the data we create online and for a portion of any ad revenue or brand activations that we make possible by participating in a metaverse experience.  We will also be able to contribute our personal datasets to build more representative and true-to-life virtual worlds. When we become part of a content experience, it is reasonable that we share in its financial upside. This is the power of Web 3.  The new data ownership  Since the birth of the internet, we’ve lost control of our data in two ways: gradually, then suddenly. For a long time, the only people raising concerns about data ownership were activists who watched in horror as companies built toll booths on the information superhighway and began extracting value from individual’s personal data.  With the rise of social media and Web 2, it has been impossible to ignore how big tech has amassed unimaginable troves of personal information often without our knowledge or truly informed consent. Who really reads the terms and conditions?  For many people, relinquishing control of their data is an easy choice. The internet services and products we use every day are infinitely convenient and our personal data is the price of admission. Web 3 offers a game-changing window of opportunity where we can claim our hyperreal virtual identities without having to cede our personal data to centralized third-party platforms.  There are many questions that still need to be answered about data security in Web 3 – like the ability to restore our identities if we lose our keys. Likewise, it is essential that the high-resolution biometric data that personal avatars are based on does not find its way into the hands of every company or developer that builds virtual experiences in the metaverse.  The concept of extending our individual sovereignty into virtual space without being beholden to corporations is a powerful idea.  If the metaverse is going to become a seamless extension of physical reality and then some, we’ll need to enable persistent, portable versions of our virtual selves. We don’t have to change our identities when we go to the store, the office or a friend’s party in the real world and it should be the same in the metaverse.  While we may have multiple versions of our hyperreal avatar that allow us to play with our identity, such as creating younger versions of ourselves, or rendering ourselves as a different gender, these hyperreal creative permutations are all ultimately based on our real world data, personalities and desires.  When we securely store our personal data in NFTs, we are able to transport this information across virtual spaces in the metaverse. At the same time, NFTs give the user complete control over when and how this personal information is used by third parties. We can prove we are who we say we are in any context without requiring that we first reveal sensitive personal information.  Hyperreal NFTs like these can become a decentralized and user-controlled identity verification platform built into the fabric of the metaverse.  This transition to hyperreality is already well underway. Those working to secure personal data with NFTs are plotting the course toward a metaverse where our virtual selves have all the characteristics that we value in our flesh-and-blood identities. Indeed, our physical selves are non-fungible and, in ideal conditions, we are in control of our bodies and actions. Now we finally have the technology to allow regular people to protect and control who they are and what they do in the metaverse.  See also: Web 3 and DAOs in 2022  But the more realistic the metaverse becomes through technological advancement, the more we need to consider who we “become” in an internet that looks and feels like reality. The hyperreal metaverse might be more Web 3.1 than Web 3.0 – explained as the emergence of a “read/write/own/be” internet.  If the digital worlds we occupy look exactly like they were shot with a camera on location and are populated with photo-realistic versions of ourselves and loved ones, is it still just the internet?  Or are we creating a seamless extension of reality that forces us to “be” ourselves beyond the confines of the physical world? Or are we creating something a bit more than ourselves?

It was one of the largest non-fungible token (NFT) mintings ever. The sale of 55,000 pieces of virtual land at the Otherside digital land sale generated approximately $320 million. Over the weekend, the online land sale for this Otherside metaverse took place, and many people bought &apos;Otherdeeds,&apos; Ethereum-based NFTs.

42374651,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1pCT,1653393803,"Coinbase-Led Travel Rule Group Grows Members, Expands to Canada and Singapore","The Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST), originally a group of five U.S. companies building an anti-money laundering (AML) system for cryptocurrency transactions, has grown its membership to over 30 firms and expanded its jurisdictional footprint to include Canada and Singapore.  TRUST, originally kick-started by crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) with help from BitGo, Gemini, Kraken and Fidelity, emerged from stealth mode almost a year ago, at which time it went by the less catchily titled U.S. Travel Rule Working Group (USTRWG).  Since officially launching, TRUST has gone live in Canada and Singapore, and is actively working to expand to other global jurisdictions, including Germany and other countries in the European Union, according to a press release.  The original founding membership has now swollen to over 30, including heavyweights like Binance US, Circle, Robinhood (HOOD) and Paxos. Having started out supporting just bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) transactions, TRUST now allows integration of all ERC-20 tokens, a spokeswoman confirmed via email.  The crypto industry was given AML marching orders from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) back in mid-2019, requiring virtual asset service providers (VASP) such as exchanges, trading desks and custodians transfer personally identifiable information along with crypto transactions over a certain threshold. Since then a number of proposed solutions and consortia efforts have been tabled as well as a messaging content data standard for digital assets transactions.  “There’s no doubt in my mind that there will be multiple travel rule solution networks that will emerge and probably there will be some interoperability of sorts that needs to be figured out between TRUST and other solutions,” said Canada-based crypto custodian Balance CEO George Bordianu in an interview, adding:  “But by and large, it seems like TRUST will be the predominant one, so this is where we have put in our time and effort.”  TRUST works by guaranteeing no central storage of customers’ personal data, while using a system of digital signatures between VASPs to ensure the correct address is being used in bi-lateral data sharing channels.  Speaking about joining TRUST, John Mannino, chief compliance officer at sFOX – which is regulated in the U.S. and in Singapore – compared the crypto industry’s problem solving response to the growing pains of financial derivatives markets.  “During the growth of derivatives, we had sort of similar situations involving industry-wide problems,” Mannino said in an interview. “Rather than each company going off and trying to solve this problem independently, when we come together we can solve it once and then everybody can use it.”  The current full list of TRUST members includes: Amber Group, Anchorage, Balance, Binance US, BitGo, bitFlyer, Bittrex, BlockFi, BlocPal, Cake DeFi, Circle, Coinbase, Coinhako, Coinsmart, Coinsquare, Crypto.com, Custodia, Fidelity Digital AssetsSM, Gemini, Kraken, Netcoins, Nexo, Paxos, Robinhood, sFOX, Shakepay, Standard Custody & Trust, Symbridge, Tetra Trust, TradeStation, Unbanked, VirgoCX, Voyager, Wealthsimple, Zero Hash and Zodia Custody.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/24/coinbase-led-travel-rule-group-grows-members-expands-to-canada-and-singapore,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a13ee2eeabed90703b7822b3724e12467acf0a9-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374665,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1pVL,1653392389,"Bitcoin Records Eighth Week of Losses, but Sentiment Indicator Suggests Upside","Bitcoin (BTC) delivered its eighth straight week of losses for investors for the first time in its history amid weak macroeconomic sentiment, inflation concerns, systemic risk from within the crypto industry, and the lack of immediate catalysts that could drive upside growth.  Prices were at $30,272 late Sunday, after falling as low as $28,700 earlier in the week. Bitcoin last saw a positive week of gains in mid-March as prices jumped from $41,000 to $46,000. It has slid every week since then, falling nearly 60% from November highs of just over $69,000.  Bitcoin has been weighed down by rate hikes in the U.S. and global inflation concerns, and has traded similar to a risky technology stock in the past few months.  Data from the on-chain analytics tool Sentiment suggests bitcoin prices may see a bottom at current levels and appreciate in the coming weeks.  The firm’s Weighed Sentiment tool – which calculates positive and negative comments for an asset on social media – suggested public sentiment for bitcoin reached levels last seen on ""Black Thursday,"" a colloquial term among crypto circles referring to bitcoin prices falling under $4,000 in 2020.  Prices are historically likelier to rise when sentiment reaches low levels, the firm said. Data shows bitcoin prices have risen three out of the past four times the indicator has reached similar levels.  Recession fears have contributed to a slump in bitcoin in the past few months.  In April, Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts said in a note that the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive measures to control inflation could result in a recession. The bank put the odds of an economic contraction – a phase of the business cycle in which the economy as a whole is in decline – at about 35% over the next two years, as reported.  Some analysts pointed out that institutional investors have taken out more money from the ecosystem than poured in funds – suggesting a generally bearish sentiment that may have also contributed to falling prices.  “CoinShares data for last week showed a record weekly outflow of institutional investors from crypto funds since the start of the year,” FxPro market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email. “Funds are operating cautiously, and their actions may be holding back growth while buying on the dips comes from retail and crypto-kits.”  The market is distilled from sporadic participants who want to “ride the wave” but are not crypto enthusiasts by nature,” Kuptsikevich added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/24/bitcoin-records-eighth-week-of-losses-but-sentiment-indicator-suggests-upside,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9f8fd6f83d37f35f6cfd872f00166c28bc9f805-2373x1263.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 24-hour trading volume of ETC is $856 Million, indicating a rise of 85%. Past Performance of ETC The technical chart of the ETC/USD shows a tense bullish pattern following the reversal of the $18.87 mark. However, the critical resistance level at $24 keeps the reversal trend from escalating and indicates possible setbacks as selling pressure rises. In addition, the higher price rejection in the previous candle shows a relatively stronger bearish side.

Venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led a $32 million funding round that included contributions from Samsung Next and Invesco. Another $38 million came from the sale of its goddess nature token (GNT).  GNT is backed by carbon credits issued over the last five years from nature-based projects and will trade on Celo, a proof-of-stake blockchain, Flowcarbon said Tuesday. The Celo Foundation purchased $10 million of GNT to offset its own carbon emissions.  ""Demand for carbon credits has surged in recent years among corporations that use them to offset carbon emissions, but the ability to scale the volume of credits available has been limited by the VCM’s opaque and fractured market infrastructure,"" Flowcarbon said in a statement, referring to the voluntary carbon market.  Flowcarbon joins a crowded field. As early as four years ago, IBM said it was working with Veridium Labs on a carbon credit related token, and other companies are also active. Toucan, Regen and Moss all aim to increase transparency and improve accessibility to the carbon credit market. And earlier this year, JustCarbon and Likvidi opened marketplaces for their own carbon tokens. The wider movement is known as ""ReFi"" (regenerative finance).

42374664,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1pSp,1653383443,Social-Media Disruptor Project Liberty to Run on Polkadot’s Blockchain Network,"Project Liberty, the initiative backed by real estate billionaire Frank McCourt aimed at disrupting today’s social media platforms, has found a home on Polkadot, the framework of parallel blockchains conceived by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood.  Last year, McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, earmarked $100 million to attack the existing structure of social media, which he says is dogged by problems around data privacy and user manipulation that can’t be tackled by regulation.  The solution, in his opinion: an open-source, publicly owned infrastructure called the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP) to center the internet around people instead of giant data-harvesting platforms.  In fact, the idea of a core internet protocol for identity, networking and messaging – much as HTTPS underlies the web – has been something of an elusive aspiration since the early days of social networking, when people began to see problems arise, said Braxton Woodham, the creator of DSNP.  Still, a commercial implementation is needed to operate the system, Woodham said, in the same way HTTPS requires a web server.  “We started last year and looked deeply at over 30 different projects and ultimately concluded Polkadot has characteristics that make it particularly adaptable for social networking,” Woodham said in an interview. “We’re working with the Polkadot team at Parity Technologies designing for scale, latency and low cost volatility for messaging, which is essential for social networks. You don’t see that with other chains.”  A growing number of projects have chosen Polkadot’s parallel-but-connected blockchains, known as parachains, to build on. Coveted parachain slots have been allocated to projects backed by user communities through special auctions. Within Polkadot’s parachain ecosystem, there exists a category of projects designed for the common good, which might eventually include Project Liberty.  “Project Liberty will likely launch as a standard parachain, at least initially,” said Peter Mauric, head of public affairs at Parity Technologies. “There’s an opportunity for something like this, a very good service for everyone in the Polkadot ecosystem and Web 3 broadly, to be voted in by the community later as a common-good chain.”  Also further down the line, a token attached to Project Liberty is in the planning, Woodham said. Details will follow later this year.  “The token is important because messaging is a resource and a token will be used to manage stable bandwidth resources for messaging and social media that is scalable,” he said. “We think that’s going to be really unique in the blockchain space.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/24/social-media-disruptor-project-liberty-to-run-on-polkadots-blockchain-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5343021689671551fff7462cb0f7787ef4d0d1cb-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374663,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw1pU5,1653375600,Ex-Deutsche Telekom Team Launch Liquid Staking Division at Crypto Custodian Finoa,"Looks like Deutsche Telekom’s (DTEGY) loss is Finoa’s gain.  Six months after departing the European telecoms giant, Andreas Dittrich and Daniel Schrader – two of Deutsche Telekom’s former blockchain team – have helped create a unit at cryptocurrency custody provider Finoa for building infrastructure to support proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.  Finoa, regulated by Germany’s BaFin, will work with PoS specialist StakeWise, the companies announced Monday. The new Finoa Consensus Services subsidiary will offer liquid staking.  As Ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain, makes its transition from proof-of-work (PoW) mining to PoS, participants running transaction validator nodes are required to lock up ether (ETH) tokens on the network, for which staking yield can be earned over time. Offering participants a way to have their cake and eat it, liquid staking platforms provide users with IOU tokens representing assets bound to a network for staking and validation purposes, unlocking the ability to use those liquid tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, for instance.  Finoa has offered in-custody staking for several years. It will run validators on the Ethereum network and become a StakeWise operator for both Gnosis and Ethereum, explained Dittrich, managing director of the new division.  “In our opinion, liquid staking will be on every single PoS network out there within a year or two,” Dittrich said in an interview. “Right now, this might be a new thing, but it will be abundant and very normal in the future. You can’t do without liquid staking.”  There’s a well-trodden path that leads innovators away from bureaucratic enterprises to nimble startups, a steady stream that flows from banks and blue-chip companies to crypto-native firms.  “It was great working for Deutsche Telekom, with this awesome power behind you and being able to steer it once in a while,” Dittrich said. “But really, the speed at which you can move stuff in a company like Finoa is enormous and it’s fully crypto-native.”  Still, the recent collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin and its related LUNA, might influence regulators’ and the public’s perceptions of complex mechanisms used to earn yield from next-generation blockchains.  “We expect regulation will come to this space. Maybe the pure infrastructure part of staking might remain like a technical or IT service,” he said. “But if you are talking liquid staking that’s pretty close to becoming a financial service. We need to be ready for our institutional clients who want to actively support proof of stake networks but also want to do more with their assets. So we are preparing the crypto space for future regulation.”",POSITIVE,ETH | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LUNA | MINING | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/24/ex-deutsche-telekom-team-launch-liquid-staking-division-at-crypto-custodian-finoa,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce7a2511261bf7d3c3cba3deb47cccdcef63fc2a-4840x3240.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Kwon Has Drawn Significant Scrutiny Since Terra ecosystem&apos;s UST de-pegging event and LUNA collapse, founder Do Kwon has been the subject of scrutiny. Just last week, reports emerged that he had been ordered to pay $78 million for tax evasion in South Korea, an allegation he later denied, claiming that Terra has no outstanding tax liabilities in the country. In addition, Do Kwon dissolved Terraform Labs Korea days before the collapse of LUNA and UST. While many suspected foul play, Kwon claimed that the timing was just &apos;coincidental.&apos;The post South Korean Police Seeks to Freeze Luna Foundation Guard&apos;s Assets appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,ASIA | LUNA | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/south-korean-police-seeks-to-freeze-luna-foundation-guards-assets/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=south-korean-police-seeks-to-freeze-luna-foundation-guards-assets,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

In business, decentralization often refers to the delegation of authority to lower-level managers in different geographical locations. The opposite of decentralization is centralization. There is no question that social media platforms have played a major role in our lives over the past decade. However, these platforms have major flaws. From data breaches to censorship, it&apos;s clear that centralized social media platforms are not providing the level of security and freedom that users demand. Therefore this is why we believe that decentralization messaging apps will eventually replace social media platforms as the go-to way for people to connect and share online. The benefits of decentralization are numerous. For one, decentralization means that there is no central authority controlling the flow of information. This allows for a much more open and democratic exchange of ideas. It also makes these platforms much more secure, as there is no central point of attack. Of course, decentralization comes with its own set of challenges. One of the biggest challenges is that these platforms are often much less user-friendly than centralized ones.

Despite a recovery on charts, the coin is trading at the level it last traded in the month of August, last year. Over the last few days, the coin observed lateral price movements. Usually after a consolidated phase, it can be assumed that the altcoin could witness a change in the price movement. Technical outlook painted a positive price action for Solana on both its hourly as well as daily chart. Solana has recovered by over 40% from its lowest price which was recorded mid month, this year. At the moment, Solana has been trading between $44 and $58 price level. If the coin has to invalidate the bears completely, a jump above the $70 will be required. As the price of the asset started to note northbound movement, buyers regained confidence and started to re-enter the market. Solana Price Analysis: One Day Chart The altcoin was exchanging hands at $53 at the time of writing. Although, SOL was moving sideways, the technical pointed towards a possible bullish revival.

Any underlying token can be used for trading in a crypto derivatives exchange. Two parties enter a contract and speculate on the cryptocurrency token price on a future date. During the contract&apos;s first phase, the parties agree on a selling/buying price for the cryptocurrency on a specific day, regardless of market pricing. Traders can profit by going long and if the price gets increased. If the trader had bought a token at a lower level and sold it at a higher level, they earned a profit. Traders can also profit by going short if the price gets decreased. If the trader had short sold a token at a higher level and closed the position at the lower level, they earned a profit. Both centralized and decentralized exchange systems accept crypto derivatives for trading. Exchange owners can use the potential of a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange to expand their reach to investors or traders.
