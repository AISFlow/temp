42427449,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKXPh,1488406788,Bitcoin Price Sets New All-Time High for Second Day in a Row,"Bitcoin prices keep hitting new all-time highs, buoying the current rally's staying power.  The cryptocurrency's price reached new heights today, rising to as much as $1,228.69 by 15:00 UTC, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). This recent trend stands in contrast with the fact that markets went more than three years without achieving a new record level.  Up until the last week, the digital currency's all-time high had been unchanged since November 2013, when it rose to $1,165.89, BPI figures reveal.  On 23rd February, bitcoin prices finally broke through this level, reaching an all-time high of $1,186.33. Since that day, bitcoin has gone on to set a string of new highs, climbing to new record levels including $1,206.60 on 24th February, $1,210.16 on 28th February and today's fresh high of $1,228.69, BPI data shows.  While bitcoin prices have seen a steady uptrend lately, the digital currency's price had pulled back slightly at press time, trading at $1,224.73.  Data suggests that traders are primarily bullish in the long-term. The market was an average of 90% long during the seven days through 1st March, according to information provided by cryptocurrency platform Whaleclub. In addition, this measure of sentiment averaged 94% during the 28th February session.  This bullishness is driven in part by expectations surrounding the US Securities and Exchange Commission's looming decision on the first-ever bitcoin ETF. The SEC has an 11th March deadline to make its decision, one that has been delayed in the past.

42427426,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKRxh,1488397850,Thailand's National Stock Exchange is Building a Blockchain Market,"Thailand's national stock exchange is reportedly planning to launch a blockchain-based market through which startups can raise money.  The Bangkok Post  and DealStreetAsia report that the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is looking to launch such a market before the end of this year, with the third-quarter of 2017 eyed as a more specific launch period. According to the Post, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak encouraged the exchange to consider new tools for startups to access capital, leading to the reported plan.  Other stock markets worldwide have announced similar initiatives to bring blockchain technology to the equity markets. US exchange Nasdaq has opened up its blockchain services to more than 100 of its market operator clients around the world as part of its Nasdaq Financial Framework.  Santi Kiranand, who serves as a senior vice president for SET, told the publication that the blockchain-based platform wouldn't be a carbon copy of SET – rather, it will more broadly provide a means for investors and startups to connect.  Kiranand told the Post:  ""It will be a 'marketplace', not a miniature of the SET and the MAI, where investors generally believe that securities traded are well-selected and regulated. As [the marketplace] is not a trading board, there is no regulator to verify their quality and investors must make investments by themselves.""  SET’s senior vice president Santi Kiranand has said that 607 companies have expressed interest in the planned market thus far.

The deal has been revealed to be an acqui-hire, with the exchange retaining Cryptowatch founder Artur Sapek to further develop the toolkit. As part of the news, Kraken has also debuted a new trading interface.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said of the news:  “As the industry’s leading charting tool for traders, we plan to devote more resources and talent to further enhance its offering. And we've purposed the technology to provide a great new charting and trading platform to Kraken clients as the first step in improving our own interface.”  Cryptowatch has reportedly seen a rapid rise in its active user base, experiencing 700% growth in the past two years, and the Kraken deal was the ""natural next step"" in maintaining the site's status in the digital asset trading community, Sapek remarked.  Kraken, founded in 2011, is no stranger to acquisitions. The startup has added a plethora of companies to its portfolio in recent years, including digital currency exchanges Coinsetter, Cavirtex and Clevercoin.

42427409,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKRfh,1488386816,230 Million: Ethereum Classic Community Backs Limit on Total Tokens,"The community of companies and startups supporting the ethereum classic blockchain is planning to put a cap on the total amount of tokens that will ever be created by the protocol.  In a new blog post released today, signatories from the network's development, infrastructure and investment ecosystem threw their support behind a plan to upgrade the network in the coming months. Notable signatories include startup IOHK, which is led by former ethereum CEO Charles Hoskinson, Digital Currency Group, and major mining pools including F2Pool.  The plan for the ""monetary policy"" envisions a limit being implemented, with an eye to start releasing software clients this summer.  The blog post explains:  ""The new monetary policy sets a limit for the total [classic ether (ETC)] issuance. The block reward will be reduced by 20% at block number 5,000,000, and another 20% every 5,000,000 blocks thereafter. Uncle block rewards will also be reduced. Due to variations in the reward rate of ETC, we anticipate the total supply to be approximately 210 million ETC, not to exceed 230 million ETC.""  Activation of the upgrade could come as early as the fall, and should the upgrade be adopted by network supporters, the block reward decline will begin in December.  If enacted, the development would mark a significant milestone for the project, which arose from a split in the ethereum community last year.

42427431,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKSDh,1488380567,CoinDesk Research: Speculation Driving Boom in Blockchain 'ICOs',"This article highlights findings from CoinDesk Research's new 'Spotlight Study' on blockchain token sales (or ICOs).  Based on a survey of 400+ blockchain entrepreneurs, investors and developers, the report highlights key findings in what analysts believe is one of the industry's most exciting – but opaque – markets and applications.  For more of our reports, please visit CoinDesk Research.    CoinDesk    CoinDesk Research is proud to reveal the results of its first 'Spotlight Study' of 2017: a free, in-depth look at the current state of blockchain token sales, a fundraising and product distribution process often colloquially referred to as an 'initial coin offering' (ICO).  Based on a survey of 400-plus blockchain entrepreneurs, investors and enthusiasts, the report highlights key findings in what analysts believe is one of the industry’s most exciting – but opaque – areas of innovation and growth.  Most notably, perhaps, the popularity of ICOs continued to gain traction in 2016 as total funds diverted to such projects approached half (48%) of the industry’s total venture capital funding.  While a large portion of this capital was invested in a single, failed project, The DAO, we believe the figure nonetheless hints at the potential of this growing – and admittedly opaque – sector of the industry.  The results also revealed the start of an evolution in the type of funding coming to market, with companies and protocols like Factom exploring raising funding from both traditional venture investors and the retail public.  Funds like Polychain Capital have also emerged to invest institutional capital into tokens that were recently comprised almost solely by retail investors, and now even venture firms themselves, such as Blockchain Capital, are reportedly considering issuing and selling their own blockchain tokens.  [optin-monster-shortcode id=""riuyojisrlntqyiu""]  Two sides of the coin  In the study, CoinDesk Research tapped into its large network of accelerators, venture capital firms, independent entrepreneurs, cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors to get an idea of overall market sentiment, as well as the contrast between the 'entrepreneurial' and 'investor' perspectives on the ICO phenomenon.  Our 'entrepreneurial' segment was comprised of mostly (86%) those working at startups with less than 10 employees or $1m raised or in the bank, while a vast majority (89%) of our 'investor' segment had significant experience investing in bitcoin and examining ICOs for their personal portfolios.  Entrepreneur results were analyzed to get a perspective of how startups are looking at token sales for potential fundraising options, while 'investor' results were analyzed to get a perspective on the other side of the market – the actual purchasers of new blockchain tokens.  This group included retail investors and institutional capital, and all the reasons they may be investing in an ICO – whether to interact and use a new blockchain protocol or application, or purely in an attempt to profit from token value appreciation.  Despite the potential allure of fundraising for, or investing in, emerging blockchain projects with token sales, both the industry and the ICO trend are still very much in their infancy, and entrepreneurs and investors show a mixture of caution and interest when considering naming conventions, token structures and legal frameworks, as the results of our survey indicate.  Initiatives  are also developing to help inform and guide those considering token sale launches, and the thoughts behind published 'core principals' have started to shape the minds of those getting involved.  Conducted in January 2017, the CoinDesk Research survey found that a large majority (83%) of surveyed participants familiar with cryptocurrency were also familiar with ICOs, and nearly half (47%) had participated in a token sale.  Perhaps most notably, almost a third (29%) of entrepreneurs without ICO fundraising experience had seriously considered raising with a token sale, and nearly all (91%) of investors who had participated in an ICO said they would consider participating in future blockchain token launches.  Also noteworthy was that survey respondents had significantly greater experience investing in blockchain assets like bitcoin and ether than more traditional alternatives like commodities (for example, gold or silver) or crowdfunding (for example, startups on AngelList).  In total, only about a quarter (26%) believe ICO issuers could have successfully raised traditional venture capital or angel investment funding as an alternative to their token sales, while nearly half (44%) did not think traditional fundraising efforts would have worked.  The survey further revealed that respondents believe institutional capital will soon begin to control ICOs over retail investors, perhaps suggesting the quality of token sales and the blockchain projects they support is seen to be increasing, causing more traditional investors to begin to take note.  Nearly half of all respondents (45%) think token sales are becoming an opportunity for institutional investors, while only just over a quarter (27%) thought retail investors would continue to dominate token sale allocations.  These weren’t the only findings from the extensive survey, however.

42427419,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKRph,1488377153,Indian Central Banker: Potential of Blockchain Currencies 'Overstated',"The potential of digital currencies like bitcoin is ""being overstated"", a senior official for the Reserve Bank of India said in a speech today.  Speaking  at a financial technology conference in Mumbai, RBI deputy governor Rama Subramaniam Gandhi took critical aim at the tech, arguing that the widespread belief that digital currencies will replace government-issued ones is overblown.  Gandhi – who has critiqued digital currencies in the past when discussing the central bank’s research into blockchain – told attendees:  ""Blockchain, the foundation for bitcoins-like innovations, is touted to be the death knell of currency. I believe its potential is being overstated. We can see that in these types of solutions for virtual currency, there is no central bank or monetary authority. They pose potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks.""  The deputy governor based his argument on two points: that most people won’t be confident enough in the system to use a digital currency without an issuing authority, and that a ""difficult to track"" cryptocurrency does not make it anonymous – an attribute he considers a key feature of a currency.  ""Therefore, it may remain a pipe dream that blockchain will eliminate ‘currency’, by ushering in ‘virtual currency’,"" he said.  ""The 'confidence' in bitcoins or for that matter any virtual currency based on blockchain or any other technology is also limited to its initial rounds and circles only,"" Gandhi went on. ""The initial rounds are always filled with adventurists and risk seekers; the moment masses get in, the risk-avoiders get in, they will need greater 'confidence' for acceptance and that can come only if an 'authority' issues it.""  However, Gandhi indicated he was ""glad"" about blockchain research undertakings at the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), which is backed by the RBI.  ""There is a movement to make use of blockchain technology for virtual currency by the central banks themselves,"" he said. ""Of course, this calls for lot of research.""

42427433,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKSBh,1488371414,Disruption Not Included? Ethereum Alliance Shows Blockchain Shift,"Startups, by definition, seek disruption – but that age-old trend is being bucked by developments in the blockchain technology sector.  As evidenced by the much-anticipated launch of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance yesterday, the new blockchain group is defined – and seeks to create value through – its diversity of members.  Over the course of two panels at a New York event, executives from JP Morgan, Microsoft, CME Group, ING and BNY Mellon made one trend abundantly clear – if the ethereum blockchain is ever going to host a substantial number of assets, competitors of all types are going to have to learn how to play nicely.  But its not just billion-dollar enterprises that stand to gain by additional resources being invested on the private, permissioned versions of ethereum popular among regulated companies.  The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is also a consortium of startups.  From Nuco and ConsenSys (which are both founding members of the board of directors) to AMIS, Brainbot Technologies, Chronicled and Tendermint (which are founding members), startups too have much to gain and lose from the new approach.  Speaking during a panel designed to show a diverse sampling of the membership, the CEO of blockchain services startup Nuco said that the mix of companies helped give larger organizations a sense of credibility.  Matt Spoke said:  ""You've seen a lot of corporate people going into the startup world, and you've seen a lot of people in the startup world going corporate. We realize we need each other.""  Spoke co-founded Nuco last year after leaving ""Big Four"" accounting firm Deloitte to build blockchain networks for a wide variety of industries. Also on stage with him were representatives from business consultancy Accenture, ethereum startup ConsenSys, futures platform CME Group and software provider Microsoft.  In this way, the event served to showcase the alliance at the center of the newly minted Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, and by extent, shine a light on the novel approach it is taking to ecosystem development.  All hands on deck  In an attempt to meet the diverse demands of such a group, the management structure is being crafted to minimize the top-down structure typical of more traditional groups.  Building on the principles of collaboration called for by ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin, CME Group's blockchain lead Sandra Ro acknowledged skeptics of the consortia model, saying that a rotating board was specifically designed to minimize a single member's influence, while a tech-focused sub committee would help drive innovation.  ""When the groups have a purpose and specific goals they want to reach, I think we need more not less,"" said Ro.  According to ethereum co-founder and CEO of ConsenSys, Joe Lubin, the group is ""taking decentralization seriously"" in its management structure.  Still, while the board is also designed to give members a sense of accountability, more experimental governance models are also being considered.  ""Everything starts as an idea, with one person,"" said Lubin. ""That happened. But ethereum is moving towards decentralization.""  Accenture's David Treat called blockchain development ""a team sport"" and Microsoft's Marley Gray said blockchain is about more than just distributing technology and increasing transparency, but distributing the cost and risk of development and implementation.  As that happens, he said:  ""We'll start to see consortia crossing industries.""  Parsing the widget  But there’s no doubt where the momentum currently lies, as the shear number of competing consortia in the space makes clear. At the event, one entire panel was dedicated to ethereum for finance.  If the hybrid governance model of a rotating board with smart contract-coded decision-making is successfully implemented, the hope is that these companies can satisfy regulatory requirements while better capitalizing on ethereum's technical capabilities.  ""We have to play a different game,"" said ING blockchain developer Toon Leijtens. ""We have to be part of a new culture.""  Whereas in the past, software improvements were done by ""parsing the widget"" as BNY Mellon's Vivek Kohil described it, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance has the potential to do more than just create new features.  ""The old game was a widget crisis,"" said Kohil. ""The new game is not going to be a widget crisis, it's going to be what is your data worth?""  Santander's head of R&D and innovation, Julio Faura, argued that ethereum was not created to replace enterprise architectures and it will likely ""take some work"" to make that happen.  The winners of that fight will be the early adopters according to Patrick Schmid, vice president of research at The Institutes, who said:  ""The incumbents in this space that join quicker will be the victors.""  Talent and numbers  Perhaps most crucial to these enterprises is what Wipro’s Ramesh Babu called ""the vibrant development community"".  Babu expanded on Schmid’s statement, saying that ethereum itself had an ""early mover advantage.""  In the end, moderator Elizabeth Aquino of JP Morgan argued that simply finding ways to save money wouldn't lead to large-scale benefits, even with a vast community of open-source developers.  She concluded:  ""Whoever can be creative enough and smart enough around identifying the revenue play, new value propositions, are going to be the big winner.""

42427421,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKRvh,1488365427,Bank of Japan Official: DAO-Style Problems Could Dampen DLT,"An official from Japan’s central bank invoked failed ethereum project The DAO in a speech yesterday, suggesting that reoccurrences of such events could impede blockchain adoption.  Speaking  at a fintech forum hosted by the bank, Shigehiro Kuwabara, Bank of Japan executive director, argued that when building distributed ledger frameworks it is important to build in ""resiliency in emergency responses"".  Notably, Kuwabara directly cited The DAO, the smart contract-powered funding vehicle that collected over $100m-worth of cryptocurrency as part of a planned bid to invest in community projects.  The project raised those funds by selling tokens that were to be used by stakeholders to cast votes for projects they wanted to see funded going forwards. Yet a flawed element of the DAO’s underlying smart contract was exploited, allowing outside parties to siphon off tens of millions of dollars last summer.  In the end, developers moved to effectively turn back the clock on the blockchain, reverting the transactions. That decision proved to be a divisive one, causing a split in the tech and ultimately giving rise to the 'ethereum classic' project.  Arguing to event attendees that repeated episodes could harm confidence in the system, Kuwabara said of the decision to ""rewind the payment records"":  “There are still different opinions about the propriety of this response, but in any case, we should aware that if such incidents occur frequently, it may spoil the credibility on the technology and the framework, and consequently hinder the development of fintech.”  The executive director went on to say that, while DLT is an ""unprecedented innovative technology"", based on the current state of the tech, ""it cannot be said to have yet reached the absolute superiority required to fully replace the current centralized system"".  In more general remarks, though Kuwabara didn’t disclose any specific experiments underway at the Bank of Japan, he did touch on a partnership with the European Central Bank – work that he indicated could have an impact on how the Japanese central bank works.  “The bank recognizes the need to conduct research and analysis on fintech continuously, in view of the possibility that the bank itself may apply fintech technologies to its operations in the future,” he said.

42427430,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKS9h,1488361934,"UBS, PwC Back Blockchain Group in Switzerland's 'Crypto Valley'","A new blockchain-focused nonprofit organization has launched in Switzerland with the aim of promoting and researching the tech.  Dubbed the Crypto Valley Association – after the region which has become a growing hub for digital currency and blockchain startups in the country – the group's objectives are to pursue public policy outreach, organize events and developer hackathons, and conduct relevant research into the tech.  Backing the association are the City of Zug – which has expressed openness to public services utilizing bitcoin in the past – as well as Thomson Reuters, UBS, Lucerne University and PwC. Others involved in the effort include Bacademy, Canton Zug and Consensus, as well as Luxoft, Lykke Corp, Iprotus GmbH, Inacta AG, and more.  Oliver Bussman, the former UBS and SAP CIO who is serving as president of the group, said in a statement:  “With the founding of Crypto Valley Association, we are promoting more than a region: we have founded a global association as a base for the sector’s most innovative and forward thinking companies, further strengthening Switzerland’s position as a leading centre of innovation in this sector.”  The news is the latest indication that Switzerland will continue to serve as a hub for work around the tech.  For example, Crypto Valley isn’t the only organization dedicated to blockchain work: A consortium of Swiss businesses, launched last September, has been working on applications related to ethereum. Further, major companies like rail operator SBB have explored offering kinds of bitcoin services to consumers.  And early last month, senior officials in Switzerland floated a proposal to create a so-called regulatory 'sandbox', or a flexible environment in which companies can test new kinds of financial products.  The country's welcoming regulatory environment have also been an incentive for startups like bitcoin storage firm Xapo and digital currency exchange ShapeShift to move to the region in recent years.
