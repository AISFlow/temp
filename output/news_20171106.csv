Goldman Sachs Analysts See Possible Bitcoin Price Jump","Goldman Sachs analysts predicted that the price of bitcoin could surge as high as $8,000 in a note distributed to clients earlier this week.  According to Business Insider and Bloomberg, the note came as the cryptocurrency's price cleared a new all-time high above $7,600. Technical analysts Sheba Jafari and Jack Abramowitz cautioned that the signs are pointing to a new run up – albeit one that may take time to develop.  ""This break indicated potential for an impulsive advance, one that could reach at least 7,941. This is the minimum target for a 3rd of 5-waves up and should therefore be a level from which to watch for signs of a consolidation,"" they wrote, according to Bloomberg.  At press time, the price of bitcoin is trading at around $7,092, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The note represents the latest instance in which the investment bank has offered some possible guidance for its client base, which Goldman began circulating earlier this summer.  And amid rumors that Goldman is considering a new client-facing brokerage built around cryptocurrencies, its influential CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, has struck a decidedly neutral tone on bitcoin, declaring his ""openness"" in recent statements and interviews.  ""I’ve learned over the years that there’s a lot of things that work out pretty well that I don't love,"" he told Bloomberg last week.

15989383,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/bitcoins-lightning-network-potential-privacy-issues,1510003224,Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Has Potential Privacy Issues,"The Lightning Network is often viewed as the holy grail when it comes to scaling Bitcoin to many more transactions per second, but questions remain as to how well the current version of this layer-two network can preserve or improve user privacy. During the Scaling Bitcoin workshop at Stanford University over the weekend, Zcash co-founder Ian Miers presented on the Lightning Network’s privacy issues and a potential solution to these problems. Privacy Issues with the Lightning Network At first, it may appear that the Lightning Network would provide improved financial privacy by default because transactions are mostly taken off of the public Bitcoin blockchain; however, Miers explained that the aggregate payment data is really all that matters to an observer. “It doesn’t matter I’m telling you that I’m paying a psychiatrist every week for $500; it matters if you know that I’m paying the psychiatrist regularly at all,” said Miers. Miers added that the situation does get better in a payment channel network (as opposed to a simple payment channel between two parties) because then an observer can only see a user’s entry point to the network. Having said that, Miers also pointed out that problems still exist in payment channel networks such as the Lightning Network. In short, the payment hubs or colluding nodes on the network can learn about a specific user’s transaction activity. “If you have a path in the network and all of the peers on the path collude, they can identify you,” explained Miers. “They can do this via direct collusion, [or] they can do this via correlation after the fact. You don’t really get strong privacy from this model.” A Centralized Lightning Network May Provide Less Privacy Than Bitcoin Itself Miers went on to explain that the privacy problems found in the Lightning Network become much worse when the topology of the network is centralized. In this situation, collusion or coordination between nodes is not necessary because the centralized node already knows everything. The level of centralization that will be found in the Lightning Network has been subject to debate since the concept was first announced. An article exploring this debate can be found over at Bitcoin Magazine. In Miers’s view, a centralized setup would provide a level of privacy lower than what is already available via traditional payment systems. In fact, Miers went as far as to say a centralized Lightning Network would provide worse privacy than the base Bitcoin blockchain. “The situation gets a little worse for Bitcoin because it’s not likely to be some regulated or vaguely regulated entity like Visa or financial institutions, which have (admittedly thin) rules on what they can do with your personal data, [that acts as a Lightning Network hub],” said Miers. “It’s going to be: insert your favorite sketchy exchange here.” Reasons for on-chain transactions being more private than a centralized Lightning Network provided by Miers included: The creation of multiple identities for on-chain transactions is free, while new identities on the Lightning Network require a user to lock up funds into escrow. To gain the fee-related benefits of the Lightning Network, identities must also be long-lived. Some Lightning Network hubs may also decide to implement policies related to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulations. This would mean a real-world identity is also attached to one of these long-lasting pseudonyms. “Even if there’s not [KYC/AML], it’s a long-term pseudonym, and it’s quite easy to figure out and link these to your actual, real-world identity,” said Miers. “You use the payment channel network once to make a payment to Amazon and they ship you a product, well, now someone knows the linkage on this stuff if they collude.” Miers added that the privacy issues associated with payment channels are not even solved with something like Zcash because there are still long-term pseudonyms attached to the off-chain activity. A Solution to These Privacy Issues As one potential solution to the Lightning Network’s privacy issues, Miers pointed to a project called Bolt, which is based on a paper (PDF) he co-authored with fellow Zcash scientist and Johns Hopkins Associate Professor of Computer Science Matthew Green. With Bolt, Lightning Network-esque payments can be sent through intermediary nodes without revealing the participants in the transaction or their associated payment channel balances. These features are achieved through the use of zero-knowledge proofs. “All you have to do is do a zero-knowledge proof that [says], ‘Look, this [valid signature] exists, I’m not going to tell you the balance, and here’s the new thing that differs by five dollars,’” explained Miers. According to Miers, everything about the off-chain transactions, including payment values and participants, is hidden from the blockchain. Miers added that Bolt could be added to Bitcoin or Zcash via a soft fork or hard fork through the addition of a new opcode. “The one caveat to this is that in Bitcoin you need to be able to anonymize the funding of the channel,” Miers clarified. Without an anonymous funding mechanism, the last payment associated with a particular channel can be linked to the original funding of the channel.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | ZEC | FORKS,,0,0,Crypto Daily,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/bitcoins-lightning-network-potential-privacy-issues,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15989383.jpeg

Though most of the groups to date to try out the standard have been academic institutions, the FSMB's pilot represents a notable use case in the medical field. The FSMB dates back to the early 20th century and counts the 70 state medical and osteopathic regulatory boards within the U.S.  Materials published online suggest that the pilot began last month, though it's unclear at this time whether the FSMB will consider any applications of the tech beyond the scope of the pilot.

At press time, the fork of the etheruem blockchain is trading at around $15.00. As per CoinMarketCap, the ninth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has gained 16.90 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, ETC is up 38.88 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is carrying 21.68 percent gains.  Volume figures show the rally has been in part fueled by Korean exchanges offering trading in ethereum classic to South Korean won (ETC/KRW) pairs. As per CoinMarketCap, trading volumes on Bithumb, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, have jumped by 53.52 percent over the last 24 hours.  Elsewhere, the investor community is associating the price rally with the listing of ETC and ETH futures on OKEX, a digital asset trading platform launched by China-based exchange OKCoin.  Whatever the reason for the recent gains, the rally looks solid on the technical charts. Price action analysis indicates that the cryptocurrency could rally to $17.88 levels.  Ethereum classic chart  The above chart shows:  Consolidation (sideways channel) has ended with a bullish breakout.  The relative strength index (RSI) is overbought.  View  Bullish break has opened doors for a rally to $17.88 levels (target as per the measured height method, i.e. difference between the channel high/low added to the channel resistance).

According to a report by South China Morning Post, Yao Qian, who leads cryptocurrency research for China's central bank, explained the importance of introducing digital legal tender at a forum in Beijing, Saturday. Such a move, he said, would help in cutting transaction costs and expanding financial services to rural areas, while also increasing the efficiency of the PBoC's monetary policies.  Qian remarked at the event that ""the development of digital economy needs central bank-issued electronic currency more than ever.""  Calling digital legal tender the ""jewel in the crown"" of the fintech industry, Qian argued that it would have a great impact on the future of finance.  He added:  ""It’s crucial to speed up the research and issuance.""  The comments come after reports earlier this year, which indicated that the PBoC is already trialing its own digital currency.  While apparently keen on creating a centrally governed cryptocurrency, China famously banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) in mid-September – a move soon followed by the closure of cryptocurrency exchanges amid the tightening regulatory environment.

42400637,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKCvO,1509976808,Bitcoin Price Fades After Spike to New Record High,"Following yet another record high at the weekend, bitcoin is trading on the back foot today.  The world's largest cryptocurrency rose to fresh all-time high of $7,601.39 on Sunday, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). However, the pop was short-lived, and prices soon fell back below the previous record high of $7,454.05 recorded Nov. 3.  Notably, this is the third time in the last week that BTC has failed to hold above $7,400, despite having clocked a new high.  So what's stopping the bulls from attacking the $8,000 mark? Though the exact cause is unclear, the following factors could be behind the trader reticence above $7,400.  To start with, comments on social media indicate investors are seeing the likelihood of a short-term pullback, and the resulting caution may have weakened the bid tone.  Further, the realization may have seeped into the market that the upcoming Segwit2x hard fork may not mean free money. As detailed in our explainer, the introduction of Segwit2x looks increasingly unlikely to be a success, and fears over potential issues may be increasing as we near the fork date.  At the time of writing, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar exchange rate (BTC/USD) is at $7,395 levels. As per CoinMarketCap, BTC has dropped around 2 percent in the last 24 hours. Despite repeated failure to hold above $7,400, the dips below $7,200 have been short-lived.  Still, there is merit in being cautious, as the price action analysis indicates that a potential bearish reversal pattern could be in the making.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart shows:  Bearish price – RSI (relative strength index) divergence has been confirmed  Prices failed to take out the 4-hour 50-MA level of $$7,425  4-hour 50-MA has topped out (i.e. it has shed bullish bias).  View  The bearish price-RSI divergence, with the failure to take out 4-hour 50-MA today and the fact that the moving average has topped out, indicates potential for a drop to $7,044 (head and shoulders neckline).  A 4-hour close below $7,044 would signal that the rally from the low of $5,376 (Oct. 25 low) has topped out and could yield a much needed healthy correction to $6,400 - $6,189 (Oct. 21 high).  On the higher side, consolidation around $7,500 could translate into a fresh rally to $8,000 levels.

Revealed in an interview with CoinDesk, startup RSK aims to soon go live with technology that will bring smart contract functionality to bitcoin in the form of an interoperable sidechain. According to RSK co-founder and chief scientist Sergio Lerner, with the formal launch, users will be able to use ethereum-like tools on bitcoin for the first time.  As profiled by CoinDesk, sidechains allow for tokens to be traded back and forth between bitcoin and other blockchains with different technical properties.  Lerner told CoinDesk:  ""This will be the mainnet launch of RSK. You'll be able to transfer ... bitcoin to 'smart bitcoins,' the native cryptocurrency of RSK. You’ll be able to deploy any contract in Solidity and deploy that using the bitcoin cryptocurrency.""  There's a catch to that launch timing, however: RSK needs to wait for the Segwit2x hard fork coming up mid-month, which could (if implemented) split bitcoin into two competing tokens.  ""We're waiting for the hard fork to pass to launch. We don't know which [cryptocurrency] will last. [...] The change is fork conditional. That's a must,"" he added.  The startup says it has additional long-term plans after that, such as adding new ""opcodes"" – or rules for blockchains that developers can use in their smart contracts – that it has been researching for the sidechain.  Lerner also noted the planned addition of ""confidential transactions,"" which would shield some types of transaction data, and on-chain scaling improvements that could expand how many transactions RSK users can make per second. Both of these objectives, he said, could come to fruition in 2018.  ""We have a lot to add in the future,"" he said.  The development notably comes at a time when other efforts to bring smart contracts to bitcoin are also seeing advancement.  For example, Blockstream infrastructure tech developer Russell O'Connor last week unveiled a white paper showing a new possible avenue for bitcoin's scripting language called Simplicity, a proposal which is currently under discussion.

42400639,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKCwN,1509966013,Price of Success? Bitcoin Faces New Pressure in a Multi-Coin World,"""Blockchains are about increasing freedom for individuals and allowing them the flexibility to leave on principle at any point in time.""  If day one of Scaling Bitcoin showed how bitcoin's technical and academic communities are moving swiftly to capitalize on the network's newly updated code capabilities, day two offered a glimpse of a project emerging, hurdles overcome, into a world that appears more likely to play host to a diverse array of cryptocurrencies.  In this way, the final day of this year's conference showcased how, for the event, presenters and attendees, this transition is fraught with concern – as for all the talk of opportunities afforded by new crypto assets, the bitcoin community still largely traffics in reputation as its chief currency.  And as Scaling Bitcoin hinted this year, there are strong social norms at play among participants, many who feel strongly that ICO projects, and the blockchains and developers that support them, are little more than ""scammers"" and ""pump and dump schemers.""  This thinking, echoed by attendees, was on display in an opening keynote by MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito, who used his talk to denounce ICOs, going so far as to state that the funding model could threaten to drain bitcoin's talent with the promise of easy money.  Such thinking appears shared by the conference itself, as Scaling Bitcoin has instituted a year-long ban on ICOs – a move made as part of an effort to ensure technical standards, but that came at the cost of additional funding for an event that's still the work of dedicated volunteers.  Still, if the quote above hints at the economic freedoms developers want to enable, the reaction of attendees suggests such movement, whether technical or social, won't come without cost. Nor, it seems, will one approach prevent all of the community from pursuing new opportunities.  As such, some of the more provocative talks of the day took a more nuanced look at how bitcoin might reconsider its value proposition, design and goals in light of this larger cultural shift.  In one of the more controversial talks, invited speaker Joseph Poon, co-author of the Lightning Network, discussed work developed with ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin that theorized how bitcoin could take steps to cement its role as a ""reserve asset"" among cryptocurrencies.  Poon told the audience:  ""If the self-actualized view of bitcoin as an entity is as a reserve currency, then it's possible we're talking about a reserve currency for other chains.""  In this way, conference organizers struck a strong editorial balance – as while most talks were rooted in academic results, contention around key talks appeared more indicative of issues that are perhaps best confronted in the rare public forum Scaling Bitcoin provides.  Selling Plasma  Yet, as Poon's comments highlight, the event found bitcoin's technical community grappling with not just moral issues, but a deeper level of design considerations, which, while free of the drama of block size increases, may require the protocol's mission to be refined.  ""I think it's important to be cognizant of what type of interaction the bitcoin community will have with external parties. This is a marketing effort, one that considers this proposed self-actualized view,"" Poon said of his latest work.  For example, if the passage of SegWit can be seen as an affirmation of bitcoin as a store of value, Poon's talk directly confronted the next step in ideation: namely, whether this means bitcoin should take steps to market the strong security it can provide other chains through its technology.  Called Plasma, Poon's concept envisions a layered ecosystem of blockchains, in which smaller blockchains built above a simpler settlement blockchain could have vastly different characteristics, including terabyte-sized blocks and infrequent block creation.  As proposed, the system seeks to explore how systems like the Lightning Network could be adapted for more than payments, to encompass use cases for computing and smart contracts.  Still, Poon demurred often to the audience, seeking to stress that the bitcoin community would need to decide on whether this was an area they'd even like to explore.  ""There's no expectation of this going into bitcoin and I'm not suggesting it,"" Poon said. ""This is more of an exploration of what that would look like.""  Observers like Peter Todd, however, were critical of Poon's ideas. Todd went so far as to argue Poon's thinking is indicative of the ICO-influenced mindset that sees a need for many blockchains and tokens where simpler solutions should prevail.  For instance, Todd argued that bitcoin would ""naturally"" become a reserve asset for other chains, but that there's a difference between ""accepting other coins may exist"" and enabling their creation through technology.  ""What I'm saying is the vast majority of other chains don't have a reason to exist,"" he said.  Itty-bitty blockchains  Another talk that envisioned a multi-blockchain ecosystem was given by David Vorick, CEO of Nebulous Labs, a startup developing a decentralized storage blockchain with its own native cryptocurrency, siacoin.  A different take on a similar idea, Vorick's talk speculated on a world with ""millions"" of bitcoin-like blockchains, some of which would have very small market capitalizations.  As such, Vorick's talk focused on different attacks that could be waged by miners against these networks, as well as how the nodes that store copies of the blockchain might be incentivized to guard against corruptions by serving as ""motivated defenders.""  Vorick went on to speculate that nodes could be incentivized to watch these blockchains for the surprise publishing of a large amount of new work in attacks.  ""If the defenders are online and watching this attack, they have revenge motivation, perhaps they are more motivated than the attacker to defend it and protect their payment. If the attacker has to deal with a motivated defender ... everyone will lose money,"" he said.  Vorick framed the idea as one that could enable ""aggressive experimentation,"" though the question-and-answer session hinted that more attack vectors could be present that make the scheme naive or less viable.  Still, he notably defended the idea as a timely one, given a blockchain ecosystem where many of the networks operational today won't go away.  ""Every micro-chain would have its own coin, a separate price and consensus rules, and you would change between them using a multi-chain multi-network,"" he said of the idea.  Economic modeling  Still, there's more than culture at play in supporting the idea, there's also current market conditions, as a talk by developer Anthony Towns highlighted how the economy already developed around bitcoin is affected by contentious disagreements.  Indeed, Towns' talk highlighted the ease with which disagreements can lead to the creation of new networks.  Most of the work presented focused on assessing the ways in which exchanges could play a role in helping markets evaluate the perceived value brought by technical changes. For example, he noted how exchanges are now beginning to list forked versions of the bitcoin blockchain, but that it's difficult to tell now what those values mean.  Towns also highlighted how new cryptocurrencies could be made to represent potential bitcoin variants, comparing the model against other ideas, such as how contracts could let those who felt strongly about a change instantly swap coins in the event of a fork.  Still, he suggested determining pricing would be a challenge.  ""We don't have enough equations to work out what the unconditional values are. If you look at the Bitfinex price of Segwit2x, you can't tell if it's because the coin isn't going to be valuable, or whether they think it won't have any value,"" he said.  Towns also noted a problem with the way forks are conducted today, and in his full remarks, offered proposals for how such contentious transitions could be better executed.  Lightning in the distance  Other talks also highlighted an undercurrent idea at the conference, that the Lightning Network, while helpful in increasing bitcoin's capacity, still requires a substantial design work before it can be successfully implemented.  This takeaway was best encapsulated by a talk from Hebrew University's Aviv Zohar. Titled ""How to Charge Lightning,"" it notably looked at how a mature Lightning Network might function, exploring the costs and considerations users might face when opening payments channels and settling the results to the blockchain.  Zohar's work, to be developed in a forthcoming paper, focused specifically on how the amount of money kept in Lightning channels would impact interactions between users.  ""You start to think about channels and you wonder, when do you restart a channel?"" Zohar said. ""There's an optimal point, other than waiting for the channel to completely run out [of funds], you reset.""  In this way, Zohar speculated that Lightning channels may want to have a fee structure whereby higher costs are charged for larger payments, proportional to the amount of money in the channel being used. Still, he noted that the costs have to also be competitive against simply executing the transaction on the bitcoin blockchain.  But while Zohar cautioned his work was an ""early attempt"" at such analysis, his ultimate conclusion was that, while Lightning helps the network, he was ""expecting more."" Perhaps controversially, he hinted at the idea that a larger block size may eventually be needed to accommodate Lightning-style networks.  Further, his comments gave credence to the event's inclusion of on-chain scaling research as possibly prudent, given the aims of the bitcoin community and its resolve to grow its network in the face of competition.  As his comments noted, bitcoin developers would be wise to still consider any and all options for how to improve the network toward its goals.  Zohar concluded:  ""A 2x block size increase helps but not by very much. It's not that amazing.""

In a series of tweets on Nov. 1 and 2, UBS global chief economist Paul Donovan compared bitcoin to the Netherland's 1637 tulip crisis, the Weimar Republic's hyperinflation and PetSmart. His remarks came after derivatives powerhouse CME Group revealed its intention to list a bitcoin futures contract later this year.  Donovan's most forceful objection to bitcoin came from the tulip analogy:  “Amsterdam 1636. Cash-settled futures markets in tulip bulbs start. Prices soar. Amsterdam February 1637. Tulip bubble bursts #beenherebefore”  Though Donovan compared the bitcoin bubble to the tulip mania, he stated in a follow-up tweet that the economic impact would likely differ. And in an email to CNBC, he said that the idea of not delivering a product was ""shocking"" at the time. People picked up and traded tulip bulbs in taverns, which he likened to today's cryptocurrency exchanges.  While Donovan opposes cryptocurrencies, he did say that he was a ""big fan of blockchain"" on Twitter. In another tweet, he said UBS thinks of blockchain as a platform which should continue to grow.  Donovan is not the first to compare bitcoin's astonishing price increases to the tulip crisis. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon infamously called the cryptocurrency a “fraud” in September, saying it was worse than the 17th century tulip crisis.

42379997,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Levd,1509944454,Segwit2x Is Doomed to Fail,"Ariel Deschapell is a full-stack javascript developer teaching at the Ironhack coding bootcamp in Miami, and a Henry Hazlitt fellow in Digital Development at the Foundation for Economic Education.  In this opinion piece, Deschapell argues that an upcoming proposal for changing the bitcoin software will fail to achieve its desired results.      With two weeks remaining until it's slated to launch, all eyes are on the imminent hard fork of the bitcoin software: Segwit2x.  Its significance? The fear that it could initiate the largest and most contentious chain split that bitcoin, and perhaps any cryptocurrency, has yet seen. Such an event could have devastating consequences for the ecosystem and its wider perception.  However, a close analysis of the dynamics at play shows that these fears are largely overblown. More likely is the avoidance (or quick resolution) of such a split, one that will also serve as an important test that bolsters the perception of bitcoin as a secure store of value.  Unprecedented circumstance  A number of factors have contributed to escalating this situation and making it a completely unprecedented, and therefore one understandably shrouded in uncertainty.  Other controversial forks seeking to increase the block size have come and gone with little incident under the names of Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited. However, 2x differs from these previous attempts in two distinct and important ways.  The first is in its substantial backing. The scheduled 2x fork is the result of the ""New York Agreement"" between an impressive collection of major industry players including miners, wallets, exchanges and payment processors.  At its inception, the agreement claimed the participation of 58 companies located in 22 countries including many of the largest in the ecosystem, and 83.28% of miner hashing power. This represented the most significant push for any hard fork to increase the block size by far.  And while the agreement has lost a non-negligible amount of that support since it was first announced, the majority of its original signatories have not officially indicated a change in position.  The second and most important difference (one made even more significant by its aforementioned backing) is the NYA's break from the traditional conventions regarding changes to the bitcoin protocol. This has been the source of much of the contention and protest in the community.  Unlike previous attempts to change the bitcoin core protocol, Segwit2x was not introduced as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, but rather through the New York Agreement.  This is significant because bitcoin and all blockchains are strictly opt-in, consensus-based systems. For a backwards incompatible change to be implemented like a block size increase, the whole peer-to-peer network of bitcoin nodes must synchronously update its software to avoid splitting the blockchain and ecosystem.  For this reason, it is a standard and reasonable expectation for advocates of hard forks to attempt to do either one of two things. First, they can build widespread consensus in the ecosystem around the need for a backwards-incompatible change so as to avoid a confusing chain split. Or, if they cannot create such consensus, then they can enact replay protection – as bitcoin cash did – in order to cleanly split into a co-existing minority chain with minimal disruption to the ecosystem.  Segwit2x breaks this trend by declining to enact replay protection and also failing to publicly seek and build wider community support for the adoption of the software.  This is explained by the language of the original NYA announcement itself, which reveals a deeply flawed premise: that a consensus for such a change was already obtained since, ""The group of signed companies represents a critical mass of the bitcoin ecosystem.""  Far from consensus  While the many large companies that originally signed on to Segwit2x may seem to represent a clear consensus amongst the majority of the ecosystem, new developments have proven this is anything but the case.  Firstly, the doubling of the block size that Segwit 2x solely exists to implement has been rejected by the vast majority of the open-source development community on technical grounds, and as such, is not being merged into Bitcoin Core, the most widely used and supported bitcoin client by far.  Several original signers of the agreement have since formally dropped their support. Most notably amongst these are the mining pools Slush and F2Pool, which together account for nearly 13% of hash power at time of publication.  Exchanges have also largely recognized ""legacy"" bitcoin, and after the fork, that Segwit2x coins will be treated as separate units of value. This is opposed to Segwit2x's original intention and goal, which was to seamlessly replace the current bitcoin protocol and the corresponding unit of value.  These developments alone are enough to, in my view, ensure 2x has little chance of ever overtaking and replacing the legacy chain for any considerable length of time. Let's explore why.  Scheduled chaos  Regardless of original intentions, if the Segwit2x fork took place tomorrow, with all its remaining signatories, the result would be a needless and ruinous debacle for bitcoin. With the strong contention of the fork between nodes, users and developers, two chains are guaranteed to co-exist and maintain monetary value.  This alone isn't normally a cause for alarm. However, this isn't a normal case. Without replay protection and with two chains maintaining independent monetary values, the loss of funds for many users on the network will literally be unavoidable due to accidental replay spending, replay attacks and sudden and widespread incompatibility between various software and services.  The only thing that is uncertain is how severe and continuous such a state of affairs proves to be and how much reputational damage bitcoin incurs as a result.  Needless to say, such a debacle would be immensely detrimental to the ecosystem and all its stakeholders, and is likely a far cry from what the Segwit2x signers originally envisioned and signed on to. Fortunately, the NYA is not only not binding, but its associated ""support"" and ""signaling"" equate to little more than flag waving.  Whether such supporters are ultimately willing to accept the economic consequences of following through with the split given the clear division regarding the fork is a separate question entirely.  These companies are ultimately profit-oriented and will live or die with the ecosystem, and it is doubtful that the repercussions of a deeply contentious fork without replay protection is lost on the majority of them. That this is being risked for a simple block size increase makes it an even more unsavory deal. To put it simply, circumstances have changed dramatically since the participating companies agreed to what then likely seemed like a safe and straightforward commitment.  That is why it is likely that the Segwit2x agreement will only continue to lose more support prior to the activation date. Indeed, perhaps the only reason that we haven't seen more of this already is that there is little incentive for these companies to be among the first to back out of their agreement while there remains time before they are required to actually act on it.  By virtue of this, should Segwit2x launch at all, it will likely debut with much less than currently advertised support. Thus, signers are faced with the actual risk and cost of following through given the clear division in the ecosystem.  The market will decide  Should Segwit2x emerge in any way besides being accepted by users and the market as the ""new"" and superior bitcoin as it originally set out to do, it will be reflected in its market price. The best indication of how that price might look like are coin split futures markets on several exchanges like Bitfinex, which roughly value a future Segwit2x coin at about 15% of the value of a bitcoin.  Regardless of initial miner signaling, a battle for hash power would quickly play out between the two chains that can ultimately only be determined by profitability. Because miners ultimately have large sunk and ongoing costs, hash power must ultimately follow the chain that is the most profitable to mine.  But how can we be sure that this continues to be the case and that the market will continue to value the legacy chain over Segwit2x, especially if an initial exodus of hash power renders transaction times painfully slow? What if, to add to this worst-case scenario, all the originally included companies actually went through with the agreement regardless of the risk to the ecosystem's and their own reputations, and are even willing to incur some amount of financial loss to do so?  A deeper analysis of the dynamics at play reveal that the NYA was flawed from the start by not only misunderstanding the nature of the network, but by also directly ignoring what makes a bitcoin valuable in the first place.  As such, Segwit2x could never have a chance at successfully overtaking bitcoin in market value regardless of the amount of corporate backing.  A flawed outlook  The New York Agreement was just that: an agreement among the involved parties. The error was in believing that they collectively had the ability to change the bitcoin protocol without any additional support as they represented a critical mass of the bitcoin ecosystem.  There are two important components to this erroneous conclusion.  Firstly is an overemphasis on the importance of hash power in measuring consensus and in achieving a successful fork. Miners provide an essential service and are large stakeholders in the ecosystem, but they are far from the only ones. Ultimately, the preferences of the rest of the ecosystem are aggregated and reflected in market prices, which miners can ignore but at a high cost that can't likely be incurred for long.  Secondly, and even more problematically, is the implicit assumption of Segwit2x that third-party services like Coinbase and BitPay can speak for their users, and can actually decide for them what token they would like to hold and use. Such thinking assumes the implicit consent of the users of all of these services to change the very definition of what a bitcoin is.  This goes against the very ethos of bitcoin, which was from its inception meant to do away with the need for participants to delegate this kind of trust and power to third parties.  Segwit2x was organized and advertised as a compromise in bitcoin's scaling debate. But it is only a compromise in an antiquated political sense, which understandably remains our only source of reference for when it comes to decentralized governance. But those same ideas and practices have no applicability in voluntary and consensus-based systems.  Blockchain protocol changes demand explicit, not implicit consent. So long as the cost of validating the network is low enough for most users to at least have the option to do so this will remain true.  Third parties may believe they can leverage their role as service providers and custodians to side-step this through attempts like Segwit2x, but they ultimately cannot force the network’s fully validating nodes to follow their new rules. Nor can they force their users or the wider market to demand their new token.  What necessarily follows from these facts is a new model of governance where politicking is supplanted by voluntary association, and the concept of representation is rendered obsolete by self-sovereignty. Segwit2x is a compromise the participants simply never had the power or authority to make.  If Segwit2x were to succeed in being collectively labeled as bitcoin, it must be despite the disagreement of the ecosystems vast majority of validating economic nodes.  This would mean that the coordinated actions of a few of the ecosystem’s large and visible players can unilaterally change the rules of the bitcoin protocol, a fact which would render bitcoin's reputation as a censorship-resistant store of value all but worthless.  Simply put, if these companies are successful in unilaterally changing the network rules without widespread consensus, then bitcoin would have failed.  For if such a contentious change can effectively be forced on the rest of the ecosystem then other changes can also be introduced despite protest, and States who are or become hostile to bitcoin will take notice. Pressuring those visible and key businesses in order to influence and control the network would be a straightforward and trivial attack surface.  Segwit2x seeks to provide temporary transaction fee relief by doubling the base block size. But without the underlying confidence in its security, resistance to change and continuity, the cost of a bitcoin transaction becomes irrelevant.  It would have lost the very thing that makes it worthwhile to transact in the first place.  The great experiment continues  While at first glance the difficulty in changing bitcoin seems to many to be a flaw, this couldn’t be farther from the truth.  Bitcoin’s resistance to change is what makes it so valuable in the first place.  Every time this property is demonstrated, it builds confidence in bitcoin’s reliability and security and reinforces its soundness as a store of value. That the economics of the network actively incentivizes this is what gives it the potential to become the most secure and trusted store of value in history. But it will only fulfill such potential if it can continue to demonstrate these properties in the face of ever larger threats to them.  2x isn’t the first such test, and it won’t be the last.  The choice between the legacy bitcoin and 2x is a choice between a continuously proven and non-censorable store of value, and a provenly compromised store of value with temporarily lower transaction fees.  If futures markets are any indication, then choice for the market is an easy one – and the result is clear: the Segwit2x hard fork is doomed to fail.
