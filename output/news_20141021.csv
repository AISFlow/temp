42398021,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAWv,1413932465,Technology Retailer CeX Now Accepts Bitcoin Across the UK,"Technology exchange and retailer CeX is set to become the first high street retailer in the United Kingdom to integrate bitcoin payments nationwide.  CeX  will roll out bitcoin payments at 30 of its 266 UK stores beginning today. More stores will join the initial group in coming weeks as staff are trained, the firm told CoinDesk.  The move follows a trial run at its Glasgow location, where a bitcoin ATM was installed and the store leadership conducted a temporary bitcoin-only payments initiative. In April, CeX began accepting and paying for consumer goods in bitcoin through its website.  The company said it is using a bespoke system that integrates Coinbase as a payments processor, and in select stores will be launching Lamassu ATMs like the one operating at its Glasgow location. CeX commercial director David Butler told CoinDesk that these ATMs were purchased using bitcoins.  Butler said that the broad integration was aimed primarily at offering alternative payment methods for its tech-savvy audience, who he credited with supporting the initiative since CeX first began looking into digital currency acceptance.  He said:  “Customers love having the choice to use bitcoin. We want to pay customers selling their technology to CeX as fast as possible and bitcoin is a great solution. Much as we offer cash, not everyone wants a wallet full of bank notes and Faster Payments into bank accounts take at least a day.”  The company said in its announcement that it intends to hold onto bitcoin earned through the integration instead of cashing out for pounds or other fiat currencies.  Lessons learned in Glasgow  The trial period in Glasgow, Butler explained, gave CeX the opportunity to field-test bitcoin acceptance. While the experience was mostly positive, he said the company benefitted from it and the process was instructive as CeX geared up for a national-level launch.  “Most encouraging was the public response to something that many people didn’t know much about prior to our launch, but showed great interest once we introduced them to bitcoin,” he said.  Noting that “we’ve written our systems” ahead of the UK launch, Butler suggested that this initiative could serve as a springboard for a global bitcoin launch.  He said:  “What we learn from rolling bitcoin out to more locations across the UK will stand us in good stead as we look at CeX operations in the US, Ireland, Australia, India, Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.”  Connecting more consumers  Despite serving a technologically inclined crowd and its long-term involvement with digital currency, CeX says it sees more work to be done in convincing consumers about the benefits of using bitcoin.  Butler remarked that bitcoin integrations offer a great way of connecting would-be users with a means of actually spending or receiving bitcoins. This means targeting misconceptions about bitcoin, including the idea that digital currency should only be used in online settings, he said.  Butler concluded:  “Bitcoin transactions in our single store in Glasgow have been 50% of those seen on webuy.com, and we fully expect the response to our taking Bitcoin in every major city in the UK to be dramatic, both for CeX and the UK bitcoin market as a whole.”  Update (09:00, 22nd October): This article has been updated to include the information that CeX also operates in Spain.

42398016,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFASz,1413929133,The 12 Best Answers from Gavin Andresen's Reddit AMA,"Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen took to Reddit today to engage the community in an ask-me-anything (AMA) session that tackled a variety of topics both silly and serious.  In his post kicking off the session, the 47-year-old chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation detailed his contributions to the bitcoin space so far.  These included the nine Bitcoin Improvement Protocols (BIPS) he has written, including multi-signature transaction support and the Payment Protocol, plus the thousands of lines of code he has added to Bitcoin Core.  The extended session, however, focused mostly on the future of bitcoin, with Reddit participants asking for Andresen's insights on what they can do to help spread the use of bitcoin and what he sees as the biggest challenges that remain for the technology.  Here are some of the top questions and answers from the AMA session:  1: Noobies  Q: (Beaucoin) - What can the average noobie do to help spread adoption of this fantastic technology?  A: Use it. Don't be too pushy about talking about it, but do let people know that you're enthusiastic about it. Think about who you're talking to, and tailor your message to what you know they care about (low fees? put bankers out of business? take control of your own finances?)  2: Obstacles  Q: (Sorcery-Sorcery) - What is in your opinion the biggest obstacle for bitcoin at this moment? What do you think would be the most important factor in bringing bitcoin to the masses? Where do you see bitcoin is five years?    A: Obstacle/factor: getting to where people are earning bitcoin directly, instead of having to jump through some hoop to trade the currency that they earn for BTC.      Bitcoin in five years: uhhh.... 2019.... I left my crystal ball in my other coat pocket. I think it'll either disappear and become an under-the-covers ledger system that Joe-ordinary-consumer never sees. Or it will be the de-facto currency of the Internet (prices still quoted in your local currency, but payment in bitcoin always accepted).    3: Bitcoin ban  Q: (David722) - If a country were to ""ban"" Bitcoin, how could that be enforced? Is it possible for bitcoin internet traffic be blocked at the ISP level (or any other)?    A: It would be enforced the same way banning any activity a government doesn't like is enforced, with fines and jail sentences for anybody found doing the thing they don't like.      They would probably start by making it very difficult to exchange bitcoin for the national currency via banks.    Unencrypted bitcoin traffic would be pretty easy to block at the ISP level, but it is also pretty easy to tunnel it through Tor, which is harder to block. But talk to the Tor folks about that, they know a whole lot more about blocking internet protocols than I do.    4: Hopes and fears  Q: (PaulCapestany) - What are you currently most excited about with regards to bitcoin development? And, conversely, what are you currently most worried about?  A: I'm most excited about all of the non-currency uses of the block chain's ledger-ordering ability. I have no idea which ones will turn out to be successful, but I'm glad all of that experimenting is happening. I'm most worried about scalability.  5: From experiment to established  Q: (Piper67) - You've long been a proponent of the ""Bitcoin is an experiment"" line of thinking. While that is technically true, so is ""Gravity is just a theory"". What needs to happen for you to switch from ""bitcoin is an experiment"" to ""bitcoin is established""?  A: We need regulatory clarity, ease of use and no-single-point-of-failure security. I think we're very close on all of those things.  6: Socks  Q: (bitcoinoisseur) - What was the first physical thing you paid for with bitcoin?  A: First physical thing... uhh, it was either alpaca socks (the alpaca farmer is 10 miles away across the river from me here) or Red Sox tickets purchased from a friend.  7: Non-financial  Q: maraoz - What are your thoughts on non-financial transactions or uses of the bitcoin block chain? (e.g counterparty, colored coins, proof of existence, etc.)    A: I'm excited about the possibilities. I think a lot of projects unnecessarily mix up the various services the block chain provides, and try to make it do things it is not good at doing (like storing data).      I think the best projects understand that they don't need to invent a new currency. They don't need to use the block chain as their long-term data storage solution. And they don't need to use the peer-to-peer (p2p) network as their communication mechanism. They should use the block chain as the world's most secure distributed ledger.    8: Hard fork  Q: (NedRadnad) - Do we really need to hard fork the chain to achieve scalability? When do you plan on making the fork?  A: Yes, I think we do. There is still at least a month or two of work before I'd be willing to write a patch to increase the maximum block size, and then probably a month or two more of arguing. So, early next year at the earliest before even starting the hard-fork process (which must roll out to miners – they will control when the fork actually happens).  9: Bits  Q: (Aviathor) - The eight decimal spaces of bitcoin stand in the way of the ""ease of use"" in my humble opinion. What do you think? Thanks for your time!!! (sorry for bad English)  A: I think everybody should switch to talking in ""bits"" (millionths of a bitcoin).  10: CIA  Q: (FreeMarketAnarchist) - Have you been in contact with the CIA at all since your famous meeting? Do you think Satoshi will ever make contact with you or the general public again? How do you feel about Andreas Antonopoulos, specifically his recent talk with the Canadian Senate?  A: No, I haven't talked with the CIA or InQTel since my infamous talk. I don't know if Satoshi will ever reappear. Andreas did a fantastic job at the Canadian Senate! He should do the TED talk.  11: Other projects  Q: (bubbasparse) - What are some of the most exciting code implementations/projects/companies that you've been keeping an eye on?  A: I'm excited about the Trezor (and hope the Mycelium people get their hardware wallet working soon). And watching the spread of bitcoin ATMs, because getting BTC is still a bottleneck for ordinary people.  12 : New title  Q: (bitbeliever) - For how long will you stay on as chief scientist?  A: I dunno. I'm starting to get tired of the title, maybe it should become ""Head Cheese (Technology)"".  Note: the Reddit comments were left unedited to retain the original style.

42398018,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAR1,1413919521,Why 20 Bitcoin Companies Are Backing a New Deal for Digital Identity,"To members of more than 20 digital currency companies, the broad increase in financial access the industry hopes to achieve is currently being impeded by issues that go beyond finance and technology to defining transparency and identity in the digital age.  Expanding access to financial services through not just digital currency, but new systems that allow businesses to establish trust and lower the cost of financial services, lies at the heart of the Windhover Principles. The new framework was introduced by the Institute for Data Driven Designhttps://idcubed.org/ (ID3), a non-profit founded out of MIT Media Lab this Monday, and was written collaboratively by digital currency industry stakeholders.  The Windhover Principles  aim to reframe the debate around privacy, security and transparency. All entities that have pledged to the principles have vowed to support measures that will empower companies and consumers with the ability to better guard their financial information, while respecting the law enforcement need for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protections.  Though lofty, ID3 plans to work toward this goal more concretely through its Open Mustard Seed (OMS) software platform. The infrastructure will seek to allow Internet users to create a form of cloud profile that can be verified and securely accessed by any financial company or regulator that should require it, but where the ultimate ownership belongs to the individual.  Ripple Labs  chief compliance officer Karen Gifford, who helped author the framework, told CoinDesk that the wide support for the principles shows that the bitcoin community is beginning to galvanize around the subject of identity.  Gifford said:  ""This type of technology has the potential to lower the cost of customer onboarding so that if you could create a digital identity tool that a person could use once to build up their identity and trustworthiness, we wouldn't have to keep doing that over and over again at great expense to everyone. It could lower the cost of customer onboarding and enable financial access to people who currently can't access financial services easily.""  More than 20 industry participants have so far pledged the support to The Windhover Principles, including market leaders like BitPay, Bitstamp, Coinsetter and Ripple Labs.  From farm to theory  While newly announced, the underlying ideas behind the project have been in development for some time, according to ID3 co-founder Dan Harplehttps://idcubed.org/team_member/daniel-harple/.Harple explained that ID3 co-founders Dr John Clippingerhttps://idcubed.org/team_member/john-henry-clippinger/ and Dr Alex ""Sandy"" Pentlandhttps://idcubed.org/team_member/alex-sandy-pentland/ have been working in the areas of big data, privacy and smart contracts for years, but that the Windhover Principles took shape at a post-conference retreat held by MIT Media Lab and ID3 this August at Windhover Farm in New Hampshire.  There, Harple indicated that startup CEOs and regulators came together to develop a big tent strategy to identity and trust, discussing ways that similar problems have been approached in the past through open-source frameworks. Drawing on his own background working on early projects that resulted in voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) standards, Harple proposed the Windhover Principles.  Now, ID3 is taking its proposals a step further, by uniting companies to put its ideas into action.  Harple said:  ""What we have agreed to is for the companies to come together to provide an open-source solution that's totally in the spirit of bitcoin, and companies are signed onto this. What we've decided to do from ID3 is to contribute the foundational software.""  Further, his type of open-source work, he said, provides a powerful value proposition to bitcoin companies, that may have to dedicate more substantial development resources to the problem independently.  Common ground between regulation and business  Bitcoin businesses, in turn, see the framework as an extension of the industry's ultimate goal of using the technology to extend financial access.  Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of New York-based, B2B-focused bitcoin exchange Coinsetter, suggested that the high costs of establishing and verifying identity is one of the core reasons existing financial products struggle to gain a foothold in emerging markets. For bitcoin to overcome this, he argued, new approaches to identity are necessary.  ""You can look at compliance costs for opening a bank account,"" Lukasiewicz said. ""The bank has to do all this work, and if you don't have a lot of money, spending that money as the bank doesn't make sense. What we're trying to achieve is a new paradigm in how regulation can be achieved for payment technologies that are going to be more fair and ethical.""  Joseph Lee, CEO of bitcoin derivatives platform BTC.sx, suggested that by backing solutions that help users better control their data, the industry can also better meet its fiduciary duties to regulators while respecting individual rights.  ""What the framework essentially [will do], is give the users the control of their own data while allowing other companies the ability to verify the data in a very clever way, in that they never have to own the data, but they can use it for regulatory purposes,"" Lee said.  Rejection of centralized alternatives  More broadly, the companies also seek to use their commitment to the framework to move away from centralized identity solutions in use today or that could be developed in the future.  Lukasiewicz likened the Windhover Principles as aspiring to create a decentralized version of services like Facebook Login, the social media service that allows apps and websites to easily access user data.  He said:  ""People will get very sensitive about having to report their Social Security number to an exchange or give their passport, but you can imagine a future where you can enable the greater verification of an identity without ever having to give any sort of documentation to accompany it.""  Still, Lee used a different analogy, suggesting that the industry would eventually develop a decentralized version of online payments identity validation services such as Jumio.  Action needed now  Overall, the companies associated with the project all suggested that there will be no immediate changes to their services as a result of their commitment to the Windhover Principles. Yet, they expressed that a commitment to the principles is needed today, while the technology that underlies the bitcoin ecosystem is still being developed.  Lukasiewicz suggested that the framework has implications within the context of New York's proposed bitcoin regulation, the BitLicense.  ""I think you're looking at a point in the industry where regulation is being formed, where regulators are making decisions on how the industry will progress and this is a way for the industry to form that ourselves,"" he said.  Gifford struck a similar tone, noting that the Windhover Principles are a way for the bitcoin industry to show that they are responding to concerns from the government with action.  ""[This is] an opportunity for the digital currency community be able to clarify that they understand a lot of the [...] important concerns underlying regulations,"" she said.  Gifford added that the project, if successful, could demonstrate how regulators and innovators can collaboratively address issues for the greater global good.

42398007,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAJ9,1413912910,Coinbase Co-Founder Tours Europe in International Expansion Bid,"Coinbase, one of the most visible companies in the bitcoin space, is making a strong bid to expand in Europe as it attempts to grow in new markets outside the US for the first time.  In recent weeks, Coinbase has opened its service to residents of 18 European countries, including bitcoin hotspots like the Netherlands, France and Sweden. The company also sent its founders, Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, on a four-country tour of Europe to meet customers and promote its API to developers.  As part of this public relations initiative, Armstrong participated in a coveted onstage interview at TechCrunch's first conference in the UK, a much-hyped confab that assembled the continent's major investors and technology entrepreneurs.  ""Bitcoin is inherently global and I've always wanted Coinbase to be less US-centric,"" Armstrong told CoinDesk.  Coinbase's European push will ultimately put it in a contest with BitPay, which it competes with in the US market for merchant accounts. Though BitPay has enrolled billion-dollar merchants like NewEgg and TigerDirect, Coinbase has arguably had more visible success partnering with major merchants, with its most recent customer being Dell, the bitcoin ecosystem's largest merchant by annual revenue.  European merchants increasingly important  Things could play out differently in Europe, however, which Armstrong identifies as an important source of growth. BitPay has been building its European operations for the past year, and the market has emerged as a central part of the company's business.  Moe Levin, BitPay's director of European business development, said European merchants account for 40% of the firm's customer base. ""It's our fastest growing market,"" he added.  Levin's Amsterdam team, more than 10 executives, must brace themselves for the heightened competition that Coinbase will bring once it begins to woo European merchants to its platform. Its top performing European merchants are Takeaway.com, Destinia and Air Baltic, according to executives at the company.  Competition for European merchants will come, as Coinbase intends to target European merchants after it has assembled a base of individual users for its wallet and bitcoin-buying service. Armstrong says this user-first strategy is what worked for Coinbase in the US, and it's something that he will replicate in Europe.  Armstrong hinted that the next big-name merchant to sign on with Coinbase would be on-demand service Uber. He told a packed room at the Coinscrum meetup in London, which his company sponsored, that he began talking to Uber after signing up the payment processor Braintree, which the on-demand company uses.  ""I can't promise that will happen. It hasn't gone live yet,"" he said, in response to an audience question.  Notably, the UK is not on the list of Coinbase's new markets. It sent an email to users on 15th October announcing that it is ""now available"" in the UK, which Armstrong says was a mistake. Users in the UK cannot buy and sell bitcoins on Coinbase.  A 'merchant engine' in Europe  Onstage at the TechCrunch conference, Armstrong said Coinbase intends to sign 10 European merchants with more than $1bn dollars in revenue next year. This time, however, Armstrong believes his 65-strong team has ""perfected"" its merchant acquisition process.  ""We have this 'merchant engine' that we've perfected, and hopefully we can do the same thing in Europe,"" he told CoinDesk.  BitPay's Levin says his team is ready for the heightened competition that Coinbase will bring to the continent. When asked if his team's lead-time of more than a year was sufficient to give it the advantage, Levin said:  ""100%, yes. I think you will hear some very exciting news come out in the next few weeks.""  Still, Levin was at pains to stress that although his company and Coinbase are in the business of acquiring merchants, the bitcoin industry is young enough for both firms to grow without coming into conflict with one another.  Growth from API  Beyond the battle for merchant transactions, Armstrong repeatedly mentioned Coinbase's new API, Toshi, in an interview with CoinDesk and in public presentations in London, signalling his company's ambition to become a platform for developers.  Armstrong told a packed room at Coinscrum that his firm had spent $2m to build up its developer platform.  At the TechCrunch event, he said:  ""We have a team internally working on nothing but the platform [...] We have invested time and money into solving the hard problems in a bitcoin API.""  Coinbase's website lists 44 apps that use its API currently. Companies like BlockCypher, Chain and Gem are also trying to make developing bitcoin applications easier with their own APIs.  Crackdown rumours  Beyond Europe, Armstrong says Coinbase is looking to the 'unbanked' as source of future growth.  He told the Coinscrum crowd that he had begun to analyse the 'unbanked' markets with the greatest potential for growth, hoping to position a Coinbase wallet as ""the first bank account"" for consumers:  ""We made a list of countries showing cellphone adoption by country and number of bank accounts per country. Then we looked at what countries had the highest cellphone penetration with the lowest bank accounts. The Philippines and Indonesia are on top.""  But expansion plans could be hampered by ongoing government attempts to construct a regulatory framework for bitcoin businesses. Armstrong says he's undisturbed by the US government's efforts to devise regulation for bitcoin companies like his.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The regulatory environment in the US has been very positive. The only thing might be the BitLicense draft when it came out, and even then it's not the end of the world.""

42397996,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8bs,1413909341,"Coinfloor Plans Europe's First Bitcoin ETF, Adds USD Support","Coinfloor has revealed plans to launch a bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) and accept additional fiat currencies as part of its efforts to expand internationally.  Starting immediately, the UK-based bitcoin exchange is allowing customers to make deposits in US dollars, euros and Polish zloty, in addition to the British pound.  The company framed the move as a way for it to transition from a UK-only exchange to a global player in the wider market for bitcoin exchanges.  Adam Knight, chairman and investor with the exchange, said:  ""By expanding to dollars, euros and zloty, we are expanding from a UK-only focus to an international one, delivering more value to our UK customers and growing our user base internationally.”  Global plans  Amadeo Pellicce, CoinFloor's chief operating officer, explained that the additional currencies were a logical choice for the exchange.  “The XBT/USD pair is the most commonly traded pair, so our existing customers naturally have the demand to access the additional liquidity in that market, and we are expanding to euros to better service our European customers by supporting SEPA transfers,"" he said.  While US dollars and euros would seem to support the company's more global goals, the addition of Polish zlotys is perhaps less expected.  However, it makes sense in light of its banking partnership – Coinfloor banks with Poland's PKO Bank Polski, due to the ongoing reluctance of British banks to provide services for cryptocurrency-based companies.  But Poland's burgeoning bitcoin scene is the major factor in making the zloty an option for traders, according to Pellicce, who said:  ""We are entering the Polish bitcoin market since it is growing at a rapid pace and the community is very active. Poland also has strong ties to the UK, so we believe that having both markets will naturally bring opportunities down the road.”  CEO Mark Lamb indicated that the reluctance of British banks to back digital currency businesses could damage the UK's potential to become a leader in the bitcoin space, telling the Financial Times: ""The [British] banks are very conservative and are not very interested ... in something that could be very innovative and disruptive to what they do.""  Exchange trading fund  Notably, Coinfloor also announced a plan to create a bitcoin exchange traded fund, similar to that announced by the Winkelvoss Capital in July 2013.  An ETF is traditionally linked to a commodity like gold, but in this case would give investors access to bitcoin without the risk of direct ownership. Shares could be bought and sold like stocks on Coinfloor's exchange.  Coinfloor would store the bitcoins on ""physical keys"" within a secure subterranean vault, according to the FT. These stored funds would be further protected by multi-signature authentication to reduce the risk of the bitcoins being stolen by hackers.  “We believe there is significant untapped bitcoin demand that is waiting for a regulated and listed investment product before buying bitcoin,"" the company said.  Coinfloor further indicated it is currently exploring the ""how and where"" of launching its physical bitcoin-backed ETF to provide investors with ""another route to bitcoin"".  Funding expansion  The FT also reported that Coinfloor is likely to close a funding round of around £1m in the next month or so – a sum which will value the firm at up to £8m.  While the exchange would not comment on any forthcoming investment, Obi Nwosu, chief technology officer, did say:  “Coinfloor has extensive plans for growth and we are raising capital to fuel our expansion. We have seen demand for the investment round from our customers and the bitcoin community and are exploring ways to increase the accessibility of the current funding round.”  Zloty image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/21/coinfloor-plans-europes-first-bitcoin-etf-adds-usd-support,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10fed2d8ecfcb5bd87639f941ed2b3b75e06490c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397985,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8R3,1413906359,Why Bitcoin Needs an ISO-Certified Currency Code,"A formal ISO currency code will spur global mainstream adoption of bitcoin more than any other single action.  When a new currency code becomes adopted by the independent and nonpolitical International Organization for Standardization (ISO), it immediately enters the database tables upon which Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, SWIFT and other clearing networks rely.  ISO 4217 is a standard published by the ISO, which delineates currency designators, country codes (alpha and numeric) and references to minor units in three separate tables.  Now, a distributed currency having an identifiable code in a centralized database may not seem like much of an accomplishment.  However, when we consider what this means for integration into existing networks, trading systems and software accounting systems, it becomes much more significant. All the more so when we consider that a code prefix of 'X' denotes a non-national affiliation or a monetary metal such as gold or silver.  Instantly, bitcoin as XBT will be available as a selectable clearing and settlement unit for any business that chooses to offer and implement bitcoin. Of course, designing and managing the necessary settlement and hedging mechanisms will be a different matter altogether. Certain clearing networks may effectively become bitcoin exchanges.  With the three-character code having been in informal usage since early 2013, a formal application for XBT is nearing completion by the Financial Standards Working Grouphttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/press-releases/press-release-october-7-2014-bitcoin-foundation-financial-standards-working-group-leads-the-way-for-mainstream-bitcoin-adoption-2/ within the Bitcoin Foundation. This effort has its origins in a petition submitted by Emelyne Weiss that circulated on Change.org, the world's platform for change. The petition closed with 836 supporters.  Since the decentralized bitcoin has a peer-to-peer block chain rather than an 'official' currency manager, a central bank or an existing institution such as SWIFT may also be necessary to support the ISO application for XBT. As leaders of financial innovation through their Innotribe initiative, early indications from SWIFT senior management are that they would be supportive of such an application, if required.  Recently, the topic of XBT and the need to standardize various subunits has been much debated on Reddit and other social media outlets, unfortunately causing more confusion than clarification. Let's examine some of the top-level issues.  Why was XBT selected and what happens to BTC?  The code XBT was selected because the prefix 'X' denotes a non-national affiliation or a monetary metal such as gold or silver. Technically, BTC would be unavailable due to the fact 'BT' already represents the country of Bhutan.  The first two letters of the code are the two letters of the country code (as with national top-level domains on the Internet) and the third is the initial of the currency itself. In the case of the dollar (USD), US represents the country and D represents the initial of the currency.  Most likely, BTC would still remain in colloquial usage because it is already widely recognized by the community. Just as slang terms for money exist around the world, BTC shorthand would be used similar to how 'bucks' or 'quid' are used for other currencies. In this scenario, I expect BTC to continue to represent one full bitcoin unit.  Why does XBT have to represent a full unit of bitcoin?  One XBT unit as listed and recorded within ISO 4217 would have eight subunits or decimal places to the right of the decimal point. The rationale for this is that a neutral global default for bitcoin around the world cannot deviate from the unit's representation on the block chain (as expressed in the reference implementation) and the bitcoin integer in the core protocol is not changing.  One bitcoin on the block chain must equal one bitcoin in the formal standards world or else processing errors would be potentially catastrophic.  Even though eight decimals was selected as the starting point for the bitcoin integer, that number may need to be increased over time and increasing the amount of decimal places for bitcoin would hardly be a contested issue by the miners when the time comes.  The code representation within ISO 4217 cannot be changed up and down due to the varying number of decimal places in the core protocol. It must remain static.  Bitcoin is correctly placed, alongside gold, as a digital cryptographic commodity. So, just as gold (XAU) may trade in some areas as kilos or kilograms, the global default standard for pricing and measuring quantities of gold bullion remains the troy ounce.  One troy ounce is currently defined as 31.1034768 grams and is equivalent to approximately 1.09714 avoirdupois ounces. XAU denotes one troy ounce of gold and 'XAU/USD' means the price of 1 troy ounce of gold in US dollars.  How are the subunits related to XBT and the ISO standard?  Despite the fact that several names for bitcoin's minor units have been proposed, only three of the minor units, or subunits, have achieved a consensus within the bitcoin economy.  The third space after the decimal point (10−3) is commonly referred to as 'millibit' or mBTC. The sixth space after the decimal point (10−6) is commonly referred to as 'bit' or μBTC. The eighth space after the decimal point (10−8) is commonly referred to as a 'satoshi', the smallest available amount of bitcoin today.  These existing minor units of bitcoin will be submitted in the ISO application for XBT and it is not required for all of the individual minor units to be submitted.  To better facilitate consumer applications, some bitcoin operators may elect to provide a choice for display preferences. Several applications and web sites, such as BitcoinAverage, already permit toggling between bitcoin and millibit for display purposes.  Recently, some exchange operators have also expressed an interest and willingness to display prices in bits, so that only two decimal places exist to the right of the integer. For instance, KnCMiner embraced the bits display option for its wallet app. These moves could be especially useful for accounting packages that typically accommodate only two decimal points.    Strong opinions exist on all sides for going to a bits display, a millibits display, or remaining with a full bitcoin display.  As a consensus emerges, it is also perceived as useful to utilize one expression for retail consumers and to maintain a full bitcoin expression for wholesale level or institutional trading. This structure is entirely achievable because dual display options can be easily adopted by software providers.  Follow the author on Twitter.

42397991,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8Xw,1413900173,SnapCard Aims to Boost Bitcoin Adoption with POS System Giveway,"Bitcoin payments solutions provider snapCard is planning to give 500 merchants in the San Francisco area the ability to accept the digital currency as part of a month-long promotional event.  The company announced its '#IntegrateSF' campaign today, which will give away free tablet-based point-of sale (POS) systems to participating merchants who start accepting bitcoin payments this November.  The goal of #IntegrateSF, according to snapCard, is to turn the San Francisco Bay area into the world’s digital currency hub.  SnapCard’s strategy includes offering free transactions on a permanent basis to the 500 merchants that take part in the month-long effort. Merchants will also receive promotional materials and marketing support from the company to get the word out to the public on their bitcoin integration.  SnapCard operations manager Jack Jia said in a blog post that the region’s longstanding association with digital currency startups makes it an ideal place for the project, adding:  “SnapCard is headquartered in San Francisco and with thousands of local 'bitcoiners' and millions of international visitors flocking into San Francisco, we feel that starting locally is the best first step for us as we embark on a campaign to increase international awareness of digital currencies.”  The initiative follows snapCard's most recent $1.5m seed round of investment. Venture capitalist Tim Draper, Crypto Currency Partners, Insikt Ventures, Great Oaks Venture Capital and Boost VC all took part in the funding.  Community push needed  With the promotion, snapCard has issued a call to action to bitcoin enthusiasts and supporters in the region. On the social media side, snapCard is asking for supporters to use the #IntegrateSF tag to tweet about merchants in and around San Francisco that accept bitcoin.  To help spur involvement in the scheme, snapCard will offer a referral bonus worth $20 in bitcoin to those who point merchants to its platform. Any business in the San Francisco and wider Bay Area is eligible for the #IntegrateSF promotion, as are any potential references.  “Given the nature of bitcoin as a global project that we’re all diligently working on, it would be great to help make this happen as a community,” Jia said.  SnapCard CEO and co-founder Michael Dunworth told CoinDesk that merchants contacted by the team were interested in but cautious about bitcoin, creating both opportunities and challenges for the project.  Dunworth explained:  ""The response is varied, but a lot of the time merchants are intrigued. Some merchants have inertia to change (understandably), but it's our job to just give them a sample of the simplicity and cost efficiencies associated with adoption.""  Dunworth added that some merchants need more access to information about bitcoin and and advice on how to both integrate and manage the technology. He expressed hope that during the month-long project as many merchants in the region as possible will consider adopting bitcoin.  Bitcoin neighborhoods flourish  #IntegrateSF seeks to accomplish what other projects are currently doing elsewhere in the world – create districts in which bitcoin is broadly accepted as a payment method.  In March, two city streets in the Hague, the Netherlands, gained a lot of publicity as the world's first 'bitcoin boulevard'. Nine restaurants and an art gallery took part in the initiative, and at the time, organizers suggested that the best way to integrate bitcoin into the broader economy is to make it more spendable.  Since then, organizations have launched similar efforts in Arnhem (also in the Netherlands), Spain and the US. In many cases, merchants as well as local bitcoin activists helped support the integrations.

42397988,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbF8U0,1413896170,"BitLicense Comment Period Closes with Final Input from Circle, BitPay","Just in time for the closing of the comment period for New York State's 'BitLicense' proposal today, bitcoin companies Circle and BitPay managed to have the final say on the matter – for now.  In their comments, both companies expressed a number of similar concerns over the BitLicense, specifically provisions they perceive as burdensome regulation that could stifle competition and innovation  The BitLicense initiative was launched by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) earlier this year and has been championed by NYDFS superintendent Ben Lawsky since then.  The initial proposal, drafted following the NYDFS hearings on bitcoin in January 2014, proved controversial and has been criticised by many bitcoin businesses and advocates in recent months. Although Lawsky tried to clarify some of the provisions and downplay concerns, many bitcoin companies still remain sceptical and concerned over what the BitLicense might mean for their business.  Compliance 'impossible'  Bitcoin services company Circle said in its comments that numerous aspects of the proposal would negatively impact consumers and businesses that wish to use digital currencies, describing some proposed rules as ""nearly impossible to comply with"". The firm added that it would have no choice but to leave New York if the regulations come into effect in their current state.  The proposal, Circle said, casts a wide net over regulated digital currency firms due to its broad definition of what constitutes a Virtual Currency Business Activity (VCBA).  The company described the anti-money laundering (AML) provisions of the proposal as unnecessary and impractical. It went on to note that the NYDFS would be given ""too much discretion"" over business choices and that there are still unanswered questions about the applicability of new rules to digital currency firms.  Bitcoin payments solutions provider BitPay identified four key areas of the BitLicense as problematic, arguing the proposal ""lacks innovative rule making"" and will therefore deter job creation, while at the same time creating an ""unlevel playing field"" compared with other payment methods.  The proposal, the firm said, also lacks clarity with regard to ancillary bitcoin-related activities and disregards existing AML frameworks.  Alternative approach suggested  In its conclusion, Circle argued that the NYDFS should coordinate with other regulators and make sure that its proposal is in line with rules elsewhere.  ""In particular, we believe the NYDFS should be working closely with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the Emerging Payments Task Force to develop uniform rules that do not only apply to digital currency firms, but all money transmitters,"" Circle said.  The applicability of proposed rules to digital currency firms was questioned on more than one occasion, with Circle arguing that existing state money transmitter regulations should be amended to address risks associated with digital currency transactions.  Circle further pointed out that the BitLicense proposals could end up unfairly targeting bitcoin companies solely due to their use of block-chain technology:  ""At the very least, we encourage the NYDFS to develop a regulatory framework that maintains a level playing field by establishing similar guidelines for both digital currency firms and other money transmitters. There are several areas in the proposed rule that go well beyond what is required for other money transmitters.""  Circle's position is echoed by BitPay, with the payments processor also concluding that the new regulation could result an unfair and burdensome requirements for bitcoin companies.  The firm urged the NYDFS to eliminate the need for ID data to be collected for each transaction and eliminate the need for identification for large transactions. BitPay argued that Broadway merchants do not collect such information for each transaction, while upscale 5th Avenue cash merchants do not require shoppers to present identification even when they make big purchases.  BitPay also criticised the proposal's failure to take into account existing local, national and international AML frameworks. Additionally, the company criticised the ambiguous wording of the proposal with regard to ancillary bitcoin activities, saying that the definition of a VCBA is too broad.  The current proposal could affect developers, backup services, data escrow services and a range of other businesses that should not be covered by the new rule, said BitPay.  Ball in Lawsky's court  Ben Lawsky recently clarified some of the BitLicense provisions, specifying that bitcoin developers, miners and general users will not be governed by the BitLicense regulations.  Lawsky said only those developers and miners who decide to get involved in regulated activities, such as money transmitting, wallet hosting and exchange operations, will have to be licensed. He also dismissed much of the criticism of the proposals as unfounded.  However, many other concerns raised by bitcoin companies and the Bitcoin Foundation have yet to be addressed and incorporated into the proposal.  In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Lawsky made it clear that the NYDFS cannot risk getting bitcoin regulation wrong and that digital currencies have a bright future in New York.  The comment period for the BitLicense proposal was extended due to public interest and requests made by several organisations. While the industry welcomed the extension, the Bitcoin Foundation was critical of the New York Department Financial Services (NYDFS) over its failure to produce research data and analysis cited in the proposal.  It should be noted that the NYDFS plans to issue a new proposal, which will be accompanied by a new comment period, allowing for more feedback from the industry and community.
