42381098,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93nzR,1533934817,Volumes Surge on Turkey's Crypto Exchanges as Lira Tanks,"Trading volume on Turkey's cryptocurrency exchanges surged Friday as the country's fiat currency plunged to record lows on economic jitters.  According to CoinMarketCap, volume at Turkish exchanges Paribu, Btcturk and Koinim jumped over the past 24 hours by more than 100 percent each. Absolute volumes are still relatively small at these exchanges, with Btcturk, the country's largest, handling $11.6 million in trades.  The Turkish lira hit an all-time low against the dollar, reflecting global market worries about President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's economic policies, his souring relationship with U.S. president Donald Trump and his government's ability to repay its debts.  Doing little to calm such fears, Erdogan spoke in public appearances Friday of ""economic war"" with the U.S. and called on Turkish citizens to exchange any dollars, euros or gold they own for the lira to prop it up, according to media reports.  The ongoing turmoil has increased the appeal of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for some local retail investors, even though the sector has been in a bear market this year.  ""Every day there are new [bitcoin] exchanges coming up in Turkey,"" said a local university student who for safety reasons asked to be referred to by his Twitter handle, Bit_gossip.  Another crypto user, an affiliate marketing professional in Istanbul who also prefers to go by a pseudonym, Bitmov, said he has been using bitcoin to buy digital ads abroad for over three years. Now his family and friends turn to him for advice on how to buy bitcoin, he said.  Bitmov told CoinDesk:  ""I started personally trading crypto 1.5 years ago because of the weakness of the Turkish lira, and fear of the political, and financial, status of the Turkish government. Cryptocurrency makes me feel much safer.""  Pointing to hardships caused by recent economic policies, Bitmov said he no longer trusts fiat currencies.  Similarly, Bunyamin Yavuz, a cardiologist in Ankara, said he no longer trusts local banks and now buys XRP, monero, lumens, among other cryptocurrencies as part of his investment portfolio. Yavuz told CoinDesk his holdings now consist of 30 percent cryptocurrencies, 20 percent U.S. dollars, and just 10 percent lira.  Reflecting the growing interest, Bit_gossip has run a crypto Discord channel since 2016 that has recently grown to 11,294 Turkish-speaking members. Bitcoin purchases would be even brisker right now were it not for fear of volatility and scams, he said, explaining:  ""Most Turkish crypto traders (hodlers actually) started in late 2017, or the first quarter of 2018, and they got rekt.""  Roadblocks ahead?  Although Turkish lawmakers are considering the creation of a national cryptocurrency, local exchanges may face more hurdles if politicians start to fear the rise of bitcoin.  Turkey is not the only Middle Eastern nation considering its own cryptocurrency. Inflation-riddled Iran is also looking at the possibility of a centralized cryptocurrency to boost the economy.  But unlike Iran, where retail investors often turn to in-person swaps and peer-to-peer exchanges like LocalBitcoins because they are blocked from global platforms by both international sanctions and local censorship, Turkish banks often work with exchanges. So Turkish users face fewer barriers to enter the global market.  However, that may change given that like his Iranian counterparts, Erdogan is urging constituents to convert foreign investments into local currency.  Yavuz said the Turkish government may follow in Iran's footsteps and restrict access if bitcoin exchanges grow too quickly, but warned that if it does so, ""it will be the end of our economic growth.""  Bitmov said rumors are already circulating in Istanbul that Turkish banks may soon end support for customers with savings in dollars. He added:  ""If your national currency is falling like this ... or you don't trust centralized currencies and banks, what can you do? You should be your own bank, and I'm sure people all around the world will realize that soon.""

FinCEN director Kenneth Blanco, speaking at the Chicago-Kent Block (Legal) Tech Conference, discussed the role his agency takes in regulating cryptocurrencies. He noted that while cryptocurrencies can prove beneficial for certain use cases, they also create opportunities for bad actors such as financial criminals, terrorists and rogue states.  Blanco emphasized the importance of Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) filings – a type of document that financial institutions must file following a suspected incident of money laundering or fraud. FinCEN receives more than 1,500 SARs every month regarding suspicious activities involving cryptocurrency transactions, he said.  These reports come from both traditional financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges, he said.  He explained:  ""It was filings by both banks and other virtual currency exchanges that provided critical leads for law enforcement. This information included beneficial ownership information, additional activity attributed to the exchange of which we were previously unaware, jurisdictional information, and additional financial institutions we could contact for new leads. All of this was obtained through SARs and the supporting documents filed by financial institutions.""  Blanco also discussed FinCEN's role in the crypto space more broadly, explaining that the regulator has worked for years in the cryptocurrency field, with a focus on ""exchanges, administrators and other persons involved in money transmission"" related to cryptocurrencies.  He justified the agency's legal standing in the field by noting that cryptocurrencies acting as a substitute for fiat currencies are covered by a 2011 rule FinCEN issued regarding money service businesses that provide money transmission services.  In addition, Blanco noted that the agency has been working closely with other regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on ""policy development and regulatory approaches"" related to cryptocurrency.  Blanco referenced initial coin offerings (ICOs) during his remarks, noting that ""this rapidly growing area has gained a lot of recent public attention."" He specifically cited fraud around the fundraising method as an area of focus.  He continued:  ""While ICO arrangements vary and, depending on their structure, may be subject to different authorities, one fact remains absolute: FinCEN, and our partners at the SEC and CFTC, expect businesses involved in ICOs to meet all of their [anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism] obligations. We remain committed to taking appropriate action when these obligations are not prioritized, and the U.S. financial system is put at risk.""

42381088,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93nlb,1533924311,Coin Center Updates Its Securities Framework for Cryptocurrencies,"Blockchain advocacy group Coin Center continues to believes some cryptocurrencies look like securities by law, and should be regulated as such.  Peter Van Valkenburgh, the organization's director of research, published a new report Friday arguing that certain cryptocurrencies follow the oft-cited Howey Test and act as investment contracts. As such, he wrote, they should be treated as securities.  The report updates a 2016 version, which laid out a possible framework for regulators in determining whether any given cryptocurrency should be a security according to the Howey Test.  The framework examines three variables that Van Valkenburgh believes are important for determining whether a cryptocurrency is a security: ""distribution, decentralization and functionality."" Specifically, he says, how a token is initially distributed, how decentralized its underlying network is and what powers or rights token holders have should determine whether it is a security.  He wrote:  ""We find that larger, more decentralized cryptocurrencies — e.g. bitcoin — pegged cryptocurrencies — i .e. sidechains — as well as distributed computing platforms — e.g. ethereum —do not easily fit the definition of a security and also do not present the sort of consumer risk best addressed through securities regulation. We do find, however, that some smaller, questionably marketed or designed cryptocurrencies may indeed fit that definition.""  The new version more closely examines initial coin offerings (ICOs) than the original, perhaps reflecting the fundraising method's spike in popularity last year. ICOs raised $46 million in 2016, less than one-tenth of the more than $5 billion raised in 2017. It also provides more in-depth explanations of alt-coins and how they may fit into the framework.  Van Valkenburgh also notes the rise in airdrops and ERC-20 tokens, writing that ""several networks, most prominently ethereum, are designed to empower their users to create further bespoke tokens 'on top of' the parent network. The minting and transmission of these new tokens and their use is policed and described by the consensus mechanism and blockchain of the underlying network.""  Like the previous version, Van Valkenburgh then outlines possible risks to investors, providing suggestions on how to protect them without hurting innovation.

42381102,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93o1x,1533920448,"Crypto Unicorn Bitmain Weighs $18 Billion IPO, One of World's Largest","UPDATE (AUGUST 21, 2018): Investors reported to have taken part in the pre-IPO funding round have rejected their involvement. Read our latest update here.      Bitmain Technologies, Ltd. is about to go public.  According to documents obtained by CoinDesk, the cryptocurrency mining company is filing for an initial public offering (IPO) potentially as high as $18 billion this September at a market capitalization of $40 to $50 billion. It will be underwritten by China International Capital Corporation and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in Q4 2018 or Q1 2019 amid a wave of Chinese unicorns hitting the public markets, including bitcoin mining competitors Canaan Creative and Ebang Communication.  One of the most valuable cryptocurrency companies, Bitmain closed a $1 billion pre-IPO financing round led by China International Capital Corporation on July 23 at a $15 billion valuation, nearly two times cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's $8 billion valuation, CoinDesk reported in April.  Now, a possible $18 billion IPO sticker price positions Bitmain to displace social media giant Facebook as one of the largest public offerings in history. SoftBank Group and Tencent Music are expected to top Alibaba and Spotify for the number one and two IPOs of all-time in the same fiscal period.  Tencent Holdings, Ltd., Softbank Group and an unnamed sovereign wealth fund managing $15 billion in assets also participated in the pre-IPO round, according to Chinese news media and the investor documents. A minimum commitment of $5 million was deadlined by July 18 and signed over to Bitmain Technologies Holding Company, the offshore Cayman Islands investment holding group that has been linked to Chinese technology billionaire Lei Jun, founder of consumer electronics company Xiaomi, Inc.  Before this latest funding round, Sequoia Capital China had led Bitmain's $50 million Series A and $400 million Series B rounds with the help of China's IDG Capital, Hong Kong's Coatue Management and Singapore's EDBI and GIC. The Series A round accounted for 5 percent of shares at a post-money valuation of $1 billion and the Series B round valued the company at $12 billion. Both rounds were closed in the first and second halves of 2017.  Projected share price and volume are not disclosed, but investment banks close to the IPO are calculating the P/E ratio to be 20 within the first publicly traded year.  Financial numbers supporting this multiple indicate Bitmain profited $2.3 billion in total across 2016, 2017 and Q1 2018, with revenues of $2.5 billion in 2017 and $2 billion in Q1 2018. Bitmain is forecasting $2 billion in profit by year's end.  A diversified crypto strategy  Half a decade ago, Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan began engineering advanced application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips to mine bitcoin more efficiently. That work established Bitmain, the leading market player in the cryptocurrency mining industry. Operations have since expanded to the alternative cryptocurrencies bitcoin cash, litecoin, dash, siacoin and ethereum.  With the IPO, the co-founders' combined holdings could amount to roughly $30 billion, assuming they have retained 60 percent of the company together, per a January 2018 Bloomberg interview. Wu is 32 years old and Zhan is 39.  An investor prospectus in the documents for the IPO proves exactly how significant Bitmain's mining business has been. Last year, Bitmain machines accounted for 66.6 percent of the total mining volume and Bitmain-run cryptocurrency mining pools covered 40 percent of the total mining network.  When the prospectus was drafted, BTC.com, the largest mining pool in the world, counted over 560,000 machines that mined approximately 11,200 out of 36,000 total bitcoin blocks. The second largest mining pool AntPool served more than 440,000 machines for bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies.  In addition to income generated by hardware costs and pool transaction fees, Bitmain oversees its own international mining operation and has made $100 million, $1.1 billion and $1 billion off of its 2016, 2017 and 2018 Q1 cryptocurrency holdings, respectively. The numbers are being revealed to the public for the first time here.  Some of the funds will back up to 30 blockchain companies for a blockchain research division, which shouldered blockchain data analytics service Blocktrail as early as 2016.  Outside investments are said to represent a broader effort to turn Bitmain into a digital currency infrastructure conglomerate, and this has appeared to be increasingly true in recent months.  Since May, Bitmain has invested in cryptocurrency point-of-sale system BizKey, incubated decentralized exchange DEx.top, financed cryptocurrency payments system Circle, added an ethereum extension to the Opera web browser, bankrolled blockchain developer block.one and partnered with Huawei Mobile Services on a mobile cryptocurrency application.  Bitmain is also using these technologies to build a wallet, exchange and trading platform that will facilitate the growth of the bitcoin cash ecosystem, a spin-off of the original bitcoin cryptocurrency that is seen as a likely breadwinner. The investor prospectus says Bitmain is ""strategically developing"" bitcoin cash by mining, investing and trading the coin and its peripheral technologies for the purpose of realizing substantial returns down the line.  The day before yesterday, Bitmain disclosed an investment in tribeOS, a bitcoin cash advertising network.  Computing the chips  In 2013, the Bitmain graphics chip progenitor BM1380 utilized the 55-nanometer process, a mode of circuit dimensionality considered to be the most cutting-edge at the time. The company then shuffled through the 28-nanometer BM1382, BM1384 and BM1385 chips from 2014 to 2015, before advancing to the 16-nanometer BM1387 chip in 2016 to keep up with the competition.  Today, the older generation of chip makers has been struggling to play catch-up. Bitmain has surpassed Spreadtrum Communications, a 17-year-old company, as the second largest integrated circuit design maker in China, according to the investor prospectus. Huawei HiSilicon, the Chinese chip industry's frontrunner, is slipping as well.  As of December 2017, Bitmain matched Huawei HiSilicon in 16 nanometer chip sales, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd., the world's largest semiconductor company to consumer goods vendors like Apple, Inc., supplied a greater quantity of 10 nanometer chips for Bitmain than the Kirin 970 chip equivalent for Huawei HiSilicon, the investor prospectus says. The unreleased 10 nanometer chip joins a new class of 7 nanometer and 12 nanometer chips Bitmain will roll out later this year.  In four years, Bitmain has effectively captured 8 percent of the domestic chip design market whereas Huawei HiSilicon has taken 14 years to achieve 17 percent. At this rate, Bitmain could near or overcome Huawei HiSilicon's local stronghold very soon and, as the investor prospectus suggests, go head-to-head with the U.S. chip industry.  The Chinese market is already nudging out the American market within the worldwide chip economy, although Intel continues to lead the pack.  Silicon Valley has felt the pressure. It was reported back in February that Bitmain was as profitable as 24-year-old Nvidia, which had its stock price target lowered along with AMD's in April.  Analysts pointed to a likely drop-off in Nvidia and AMD chip orders due to an upcoming Bitmain ethereum mining rig. They feared cryptocurrency miners would be less inclined to buy from Nvidia and AMD because Bitmain would outperform them at a lower cost. Ethereum had been the last major cryptocurrency to be untouched by the Chinese company's ASICs.  Aiming at AI  Still, U.S. chip makers have not been concerned. AMD, 32 years Nvidia's senior, has assured investors that personal computers, gaming and data centers will sustain the business, with or without cryptocurrencies.  But the standard applies both ways. When almost every electronic device imaginable is powered by a graphics chip, making ends meet outside of cryptocurrencies is an opportunity for Bitmain as well, and the geopolitical incentive in China is stronger than ever.  The investor prospectus, with this in mind, outlines ambitions to enter into other fields of technology to ""cope with the Chinese government's ban on ICOs, cryptocurrencies and mining activities"" and grow the company into a super-computing titan with an artificial intelligence arm that is predicted to generate 40 percent of revenue in the next 5 years.  Also claiming testing has shown that its AI chips stack up against Google's, Bitmain is betting neural network machine learning methods in its new line of AI products — the BM1680 processor-based tensor computing card, deep learning accelerating card and intelligent server unit — will heighten processing capacity in graphics chips for cryptocurrency and non-cryptocurrency applications alike.  For now, robotics is Bitmain's first move in pioneering artificially intelligent software and hardware. The investor prospectus says a team of ""nearly 500 people"" from ""top academic institutions and technology companies"" is working on ""R&D, platform architecture, algorithm development, software and hardware development"" to make good on the acquisition of smart robotics company Luobetec and the production of the Luo Xiaodou robotic pet.  Bitmain declined to comment on the IPO.

42381087,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93nkL,1533916812,Facebook's Marcus Steps Down From Coinbase Board,"David Marcus is stepping down from the board of directors at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, citing his new assignment at Facebook leading the social media giant's blockchain strategy.  Marcus, a vice president at Facebook since 2014, joined the board at Coinbase, now valued at $8 billion, in December of last year. At the time, CEO Brian Armstrong said Marcus, who was once president of PayPal, would apply his expertise in the ""payments and mobile space"" to guide Coinbase in its overall mission.  Five months later, Marcus was named Facebook's new blockchain research lead. The company has not released any details about the work it is doing in the field, though Marcus' team reportedly has fewer than a dozen members (Business Insider reported Friday that the social media company had spoken to ""a number of crypto projects"" on how it can leverage the technology, including Stellar, which developed the XLM cryptocurrency).  Marcus has notably indicated in past remarks that Facebook may embrace blockchain, specifically referencing the idea of sending cryptocurrency payments through its Messenger app.  In a statement provided to CoinDesk Friday, Marcus said his decision to resign was ""because of the new group I'm setting up at Facebook around blockchain.""  He added:  ""Getting to know Brian, who's become a friend, and the whole Coinbase leadership team and board has been an immense privilege. I've been thoroughly impressed by the talent and execution the team has demonstrated during my tenure, and I wish the team all the success it deserves going forward.""  A Coinbase spokesperson said Marcus' decision to step down was made to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, but declined to elaborate.  His departure comes less than a month after Facebook exempted Coinbase from its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related ads. Armstrong tweeted in July that the exchange's advertisements would once again appear on the platform, a few weeks after Facebook said it would update its policy ""to allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers."" Facebook did not explain why Coinbase specifically received a carve-out.  Coinbase ads now appear on both Facebook and Instagram, which Facebook owns.  There are currently no efforts underway to fill Marcus' board seat, a Coinbase spokesperson said.  DFJ Venture Capital's Barry Schuler, Andreessen Horowitz's Chris Dixon and Katie Haun, Union Square Ventures' Fred Wilson, IVP's Tom Loverro and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam remain on the exchange's board.  Armstrong said in a statement that Marcus has ""been a wonderful addition to the Coinbase board, providing valuable insight and mentorship,"" adding:  ""He remains a close friend of the company, and we thank him for his help along the start of our journey to create an open financial system for the world.""  Facebook did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  Editor's note: This article has been updated.

42401755,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Lne,1533906012,Public Firm Becomes First to Launch an ICO in Singapore,"An e-commerce platform that recently launched a token sale aimed to raise $50 million has become Singapore's first public firm to hold an ICO.  Y Ventures Group, which went public on the Stock Exchange of Singapore last year, announced a plan for creating a blockchain-based e-commerce system in July and sent the sale of its AORA token live at the end of the same month.  According to the firm, the tokens do not represent ownership of equity in the firm and, as such, should not be regarded as securities – a move perhaps aimed to sidestep concerns from market regulators. Notably, the Monetary Authority of Singapore – the country's de facto central bank – halted one token sale in March as it deemed the tokens securities since, in that case, they did represent equity ownership.  Y Ventures may be the first, but it is not the only public firm in the city state looking to venture into the ICO space.  Public entertainment company Spackman also said in February that it aims to issue a cryptocurrency called K Coin in an effort to raise funds for its celebrity business. It has not yet made any announcement about a formal launch, however.  Aside from directly conducting token sales themselves, some public firms in Singapore are also acquiring or managing projects that deal with ICOs as another route into the cryptocurrency space.  In May, for example, real-estate developer Pacific Star Development signed an agreement with a startup called Crowdvilla in May to become its exclusive asset manager. Crowdvilla is now seeking to raise $18 million through an ICO to build a group of shared holiday homes.  Taking another route, MC Payment, a blockchain payments firm, acquired a lifestyle startup that raised $2.4 million through an ICO in 2017, and is now setting out to go public via the purchase of an already listed Singaporean firm called Artivision.  While Singapore currently has guidelines for ICOs, but no hard and fast rules, a spokesperson for the stock exchange said in a local news report on Friday that public companies must periodically report on their ICO status to ensure stock investors are properly informed.

In the startup's Telegram channel, one such user in Kenya responded to a survey saying he is using Honeyminer to acquire his first bitcoin stash.  ""I've had an interest in bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain but I never quite understood what they meant,"" wrote the user, Steven in Nairobi. ""I am trying to raise money to buy a more powerful gaming desktop in the future where I can earn an average of $3 – $4 per day. So far I am one happy miner.""  Other developing nations with thousands of users flocking to download Honeyminer include India, Indonesia and the Philippines, co-founder Noah Jessop told CoinDesk.

This flood of users is proving the mining pool software can work on computers with 1,100 different types of graphics processing unit (GPU) cards, according to Honeyminer co-founder Larry Kom. Honeyminer converts mining rewards from GPU-mineable cryptos such as ether and zcash into bitcoin and then deposits it directly in users' digital wallets.  Kom told CoinDesk the sheer diversity of insights users have provided about GPU mining with various hardware types is invaluable. Jessop said he has also been inspired by the variety of new miners.

42401765,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2LyT,1533898807,Today's Close Could be Pivotal for Bitcoin's Price,"Bitcoin's (BTC) close today will likely decide the short-term trend in prices.  The leading cryptocurrency snapped a three-day losing streak on Thursday as the 26 percent sell-off witnessed in the last three weeks was looking overstretched.  What's more important is that BTC traded yesterday within the high and low range of the previous day, indicating the bears have likely run out of steam and the bulls are still reluctant to enter the market at these levels.  It seems safe to say that the bitcoin market has become indecisive in the last 24 hours. However, a stronger corrective rally could be seen over the weekend if prices find acceptance above the previous day's high of $6,628, though it won't be an easy task.  The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $6,350 on Bitfinex – down 4 percent from the highs seen yesterday.  Daily chart        As seen in the above chart, BTC created an inside-day candle yesterday, signaling indecision among both bulls and the bears.  A close (as per UTC) above $6,628 (previous day's high) would confirm a short-term bear-to-bull trend change.  On the other hand, if prices close today below $6,183 (Thursday's low), then BTC could resume the sell-off toward the June low of $5,755. As of now, this scenario appears more likely as the 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MA) are steeply sloping south, indicating strong bearish pressure.  Hourly chart  As the above chart shows, BTC has created a bear flag – a bearish continuation pattern – which indicates the sell-off from the high of $7,130 (pole high) would resume if prices take out the flag support (lower end) of $6,240.  A bear flag breakdown, if confirmed, would open the doors to $5,240 (target as per the measured height method), although the target looks far-fetched as of now. That said, it could easily yield a drop to the June low of $5,755.  The relative strength index (RSI) has breached the rising trendline in favor of the bears. Hence, the probability of BTC witnessing a bear flag breakdown in the next few hours is high.  View  Thursday's inside-day candle has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook and indicates indecision in the marketplace.  A short-term bull reversal would be confirmed if BTC scales the previous day's high of $6,628.  A bear flag breakdown (drop below $6,240) would strengthen the odds of BTC finding acceptance below $6,183 (previous day's low) and falling towards $5,755 (June low) over the next few days.

42401746,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Lij,1533893461,WeChat Eyes Blockchain for Faster Corporate Expense Refunds,"Tech giant Tencent thinks blockchain can speed up the reimbursement of expenses for company employees, and it's trialing a feature on its WeChat app to do just that.  According to a blog post published on Friday, Tencent has piloted the application at a local restaurant in Shenzhen, China, where a user paid the bill through its existing payments service WeChat Pay.  By feeding the payment data over its blockchain platform to the user's employer, the restaurant and Shenzhen's local taxation authority, Tencent said delays normally encountered via the standard manual claims process are eliminated. As such, the company hopes its system will eventually find use in streamlining and hastening the expense reimbursement process, while also reducing the prevalence of falsified receipts.  Currently, China employs a somewhat complex system whereby merchants issue different payment receipts for individuals and firms. When staff need to be reimbursed for dining expenses, for instance, they must request a receipt for companies listing the exact taxpayer number of their employer.  In order to do that, employees need to have the merchant manually type in the taxpayer number on the receipt in every instance. Furthermore, that process is typically followed by additional manual tasks, such as collecting receipts and filing a claim before they can receive a refund.  The first batch of merchants to have integrated the system for the trial also include a parking lot at Shenzhen's Bao'An Stadium, an automobile repair center and a restaurant owned by Tencent.  Tackling a related issue in a different project, Tencent has also partnered with the Shenzhen government to battle tax evasion.  In China, merchants are required to purchase a number of receipts – known as fapiao – from the authorities to act as advance tax payments prior to any sales. As they issue receipts to customers, merchants must calculate the difference between the prepaid amount and the actual tax arising from sales to provide a basis for the next round of tax payments. However, falsified receipts are common in China as a means of tax evasion.  Tencent said that, by putting the issuance process on a traceable blockchain, it would provide tax authorities with a paperless taxation system via which it can track the circulation of receipts.

42401753,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2Lpc,1533888045,Fed Up and Forking: Rival EOS Blockchains Are Becoming a Reality,"It can be hard to keep track of all the struggles and controversies surrounding EOS.  First came the stop-and-go launch, followed by controversy over locked accounts – then more locked accounts, this time on the orders of an ""arbitrator"" that many in the community hadn't realized existed. Next came a fake order purporting to be from the arbitrator, the fallout from which led EOS architect Dan Larimer to propose a whole new governance structure or ""constitution.""  Just one problem: there was and still is no system in place to vote on a constitutional change. Meanwhile the voting scheme that is in place – for choosing the block producers (BPs) who maintain the EOS blockchain much as bitcoin's miners do – has put several BPs that aren't following all the rules of the constitution in charge.  For some EOS community members, it was all too much.  Take Douglas Horn, who told CoinDesk:  ""I'm a really big believer in the potential of EOS and of EOSIO software, and I came to believe that it was on a bad path.""  As such, Horn thought he could do better, and recently authored a white paper for Telos, a fork of the open-source protocol behind EOS called EOSIO.  And his is just one of several groups that have decided to take the software, tweak it and set up a new network.  EOS Force is another example. They propose an EOSIO-based main chain with side chains incorporating features of ethereum, zcash and cardano. Another is ONO, a social network that was going to launch on EOS, but decided to fork it instead. EvolutionOS, which aims for more even token distribution and lower RAM prices, is airdropping ethereum-based tokens and plans to launch its own EOSIO-based blockchain.  And other examples include WAX and Worbli.  Telos, though, appears to be the fork with the most momentum and support. For instance, several of its team members were involved in the EOS launch, and in more than one case, those people are helping build Telos while continuing to support the EOS network.  ""We think the cross-pollination will benefit both Telos and EOS,"" said a team working as Keten.io on Telos and Dutch EOS on the mainnet.  According to Horn, Telos' launch could come as soon as next month, with the aims to make two significant changes to the EOS that exists today: curtail the power of the largest token holders known as ""whales"" and launch with more solidified governance mechanisms that can be enforced directly on the blockchain.  Channeling Ahab  The first thing that stands out about Telos is the decision to cap the number of tokens any one address receives during the initial distribution at 40,000 (with certain exceptions).  The idea is to remove whales from the equation – primarily because on EOS, tokens equal votes, and right now, there's a ""hyperconcentration of voting power"" in the hands of just a few, according to Horn.  According to the Telos white paper, 1.6 percent of EOS holders own 90 percent of the tokens. The largest holder by far, with 10 percent of the total supply, is Block.One, the company behind the EOSIO protocol. (Larimer is Block.One's CTO).  Controversially, the company recently announced that it would use these tokens to participate in block producer votes going forward.  To reduce the influence of these heavyweights, Telos will distribute its TLOS tokens to EOS investors according to the original ""snapshot,"" but with one big difference: it will lop off any holdings above 40,000, a move that Horn said would affect just 0.63 percent of accounts.  Does that mean that ""communist"" Telos is going to ""steal their coins,"" as one Reddit user alleged?  Horn doesn't think so, telling CoinDesk, that no tokens are being taken from larger holders to give to someone else, rather the project is giving EOS whales brand new TLOS tokens – albeit fewer of them than they might have gotten otherwise.  In this way, Horn expects Telos to eliminate the chance that token holders collude with BP candidates, who can currently earn the equivalent of thousands of dollars a day in EOS coins and might share those profits with the whales that elected them.  Telos isn't alone in worrying about this phenomenon.  One Telegram user recently wrote: ""I'm sick of seeing seven voters propping up puppet BP for rewards. I consider that type of manipulation stealing.""  Additionally, block producers that are elected based on a few whales' votes sometimes fail to do their jobs. In a recent blog post, Ben Sigman, a cryptocurrency investor that's written extensively about EOS, claimed that seven of the top 21 BPs weren't complying with the rules, for example, by failing to maintain a public website or disclose ownership information.  The only exceptions to the token cap on Telos, however, are the Telos Foundation itself, which is being allocated six million tokens, and the founding participants, who will split another six million. Horn defended this decision, pointing out that these tokens are less than 2 percent of the total supply and saying Telos' founders ""are putting in a lot of effort and a lot of costs.""  Ready and on-chain  Telos' other main priority, Horn said, is that, ""Everything needs to be ready at launch.""  He said it was ""crazy"" for EOS to go live without ""all the necessary pieces in place."" Citing the arbitration system specifically, Horn said many users were confused and surprised when a largely unknown body called ""ECAF"" began issuing orders in June.  Horn could also have mentioned the ability to vote in referendums, which is necessary to change the constitution, as Larimer has proposed doing. EOS Nation, a standby block producer, has begun testing a system for conducting referendums, according to a roadmap published in July, but EOS users still have no ability to propose or vote on protocol changes.  For Horn, it's also important that all of these governance mechanisms, to the extent it's technically possible, happen on the blockchain, rather than on Twitter or in Telegram groups, where misinformation – such as the fake arbitration order – can easily circulate. (It should be noted that ECAF has since improved its processes.)  ""No, no! Everything's going to be on-chain, who said off-chain?"" Horn said, in response to a question about off-chain governance, adding: ""On-chain, on-chain, on-chain, on-chain.""  Telos arbitrators, for example, will be elected in a similar manner to block producers. This wasn't the case with the EOS launch, where arbitrators were selected through opaque off-chain processes.  And while Telos' own constitution has not been finalized, Horn emphasized that ""bullshit that's unenforceable"" won't appear in it, such as the (original) EOS constitution's provision that ""Members shall not initiate violence or the threat of violence against another member.""  The constitution should look like ""a contract or a software licensing agreement,"" Horn said, not ""something that Alexander Hamilton [would write].""  Finally, Telos aims to increase network reliability and security by automatically kicking unresponsive or noncompliant block producers out of the top 21 slots, without waiting for a human arbitrator to weigh in.  Meanwhile, standby block producers (the 30 immediately below the top 21) will periodically have to prove they're ready to step in, or their pay will be dinged.  Healthy competition?  Despite his criticisms of EOS, Horn stressed that EOSIO is a ""worthwhile"" project, and acknowledged that he and others now building Telos were themselves involved in the EOS launch.  ""We're all part of this EOSIO community,"" Horn said, adding:  ""We've had the tremendous chance to look at what was done in EOS and say, 'Hey, if we were to start over again, what would we do different?'""  Discounting the occasional accusation of theft or communism, the EOS community has been broadly accepting of Telos – and other forks – giving EOSIO another go.  ""I think that competition is good for the ecosystem,"" Daniel Keyes, from EOS Nation, a standby EOS BP, told CoinDesk.  A Reddit user echoed that sentiment, saying, ""I welcome the chance to see how it plays out. Perhaps they will try out some things that work and all of us can become better for the experiment.""

CommBank, one of the ""Big Four"" commercial banks in Australia, said in a release on Friday that it had won a mandate from the World Bank to arrange the issuance of the bond, which will be created, transferred and managed via a blockchain platform.  The technology, already developed by CommBank's in-house blockchain lab, aims to have key parties in a bond issuance process such as investors and banks to be participating nodes in a distributed network. In this way, capital for the bond can be raised and transacted more efficiently.  Called ""bond-i,"" the debt issuance already has input from investors including Northern Trust, QBE Insurance and Treasury Corporation of Victoria.  The World Bank's treasurer, Arunma Oteh, said in the release that the tech has been prepared for the launch after a year of development with CommBank. That said, the issuance timeline and size of the bond remain unknown at this stage.  According to the release, the World Bank issues $50–$60 billion in bonds every year as part of its mandate to reduce poverty and improve sustainability for worldwide markets.  Denis Robitaille, CIO at the World Bank, commented in the release:  ""This pioneering bond is a milestone in our efforts to learn how we can advise our client countries on the opportunities and risk that disruptive technologies offer as we strive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.""  CommBank, which designed and developed the platform, said it is a private blockchain on top of the ethereum network and had been reviewed by Microsoft regarding its architecture, security and resilience.  The announcement follows the news in December 2017 that CommBank was developing a blockchain system for bond issuance in collaboration with a ""major world issuer,"" whose name was not disclosed at the time.  Currently, several major financial institutions in the world, including JP Morgan, the Agricultural Bank of China, and BBVA, have already tested blockchain-based systems for bond and loan issuance.

42401767,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2LzS,1533873603,Bitcoin's Open Secret: Lightning Is Making Better Online Payments Possible,"PayPal 2.0  ?  That may have been a rallying cry for early bitcoin believers who saw the cryptocurrency as a superior form of payment, but excitement tapered off as bitcoin ran up against technical limitations. Yet, the idea may now be coming back in vogue – apps being built on the layer-two technology lightning network, which this year entered beta, already showcase transactions traditional payments systems just can't do.  In that way, the technology might allow the cryptocurrency to leapfrog the card networks and other payment startups using traditional rails. The application that's getting the most attention is the ridiculously small digital payments lightning makes possible for the first time.  For instance, an app called SatoshiTweets allows users to pay a very small fee via the lightning network to send a tweet from a shared Twitter account.  After using the application, one user tweeted:  ""I bought an exclamation mark.""  The user noted that the punctuation cost 10 satoshis, worth a fraction of a fraction of a penny.  While a paywall for tweeting might sound like a user-experience nightmare, SatoshiTweets has drawn excitement for its novelty nonetheless – primarily because these kinds of transactions are unheard of through the payments systems that have mass adoption today.  That's because sending a digital payment isn't without cost, even if it isn't always passed directly onto the user.  PayPal, for example, charges $0.05 plus a percentage fee per transaction. In other words, if you were to make a payment that small, PayPal's fees would eat the entire transaction, making it nonsensical to execute.  Teeny-tiny payments might not sound all that compelling (some argue the mental costs are too high), but researchers working closely to the cryptocurrency now believe it could open up an array of new business models and maybe even enable some more sci-fi-sounding use cases.  As such, lightning's ability to make the dream of bitcoin outpacing the traditional, centralized payment giants a reality is spawning all sorts of experimentation to demonstrate how these new small payments can be applied to apps in other ways.  Lightning's leverage  First and foremost, many apps are taking advantage of the low fees allowed by the lightning network.  ""With Paypal, you couldn't really send an amount as low as 1,000 satoshis - or $0.06 - because their fee is higher than that,"" Rui Gomes, a developer at Lightning Spin, an online gambling app running on the lightning network, told CoinDesk.  Plus, Gomes argued, when it comes to online casinos, smaller fees are what keep the business alive, since the company can charge a small fee on every play in order to keep a consistent revenue stream.  Lightning Spin also showcases how the lightning network can enable faster payments.  With bitcoin by itself, users still had to wait for miner confirmation on their transactions and so couldn't cash out immediately. But with lightning, real-time payments are a breeze, as long as users already have a payment channel (or a connection with other peers on the network) established.  ""I've built [Lightning Spin] with the sole purpose of demonstrating that it is possible to have a betting game where you can deposit and withdraw your earnings instantly,"" Gomes concluded.  Another advantage of using bitcoin-based payment technology is that the companies launching these applications then have more control over the development.  While Visa, for instance, offers a way for developers to integrate payments into an app, users need to register on the website, which means Visa has some level of control over who uses their system.  Speaking to this, David Knezic, who developed a lightning app that he presented at a recent ""hackday,"" said:  ""Bitcoin payments can be integrated by anyone into anything without ever having to ask for permission – unlike many other systems.""  With that freedom, developers are envisioning applications that range from the silly and sweet to the sci-fi.  Knezic's recent contribution to lightning development is a candy dispenser that spills out M&Ms when sent a lightning payment. According to him, the fun project was meant to show how bitcoin payments can reach beyond the digital realm.  And while that's probably not lightning's ""killer app,"" what has taken hold among lightning users is a digital artboard.  Called Satoshi's Place, the application allows users to send a small lightning payment to purchase and paint single pixels (or the whole board for roughly $65) on an online canvas. The application garnered huge amounts of attention in June as it became a magnet for a mixture of vulgar graffiti, memes and cryptocurrency symbols which displayed the territorial battles that continue to rage in the space.  And even today is remains the most popular lightning app.  Lightning K0ala, the pseudonymous developer who maintains Satoshi's Place, believes the application could go far beyond just trash-talking though.  Speaking to an age-old idea and what he hopes will be an emergent use case for lightning, Lightning K0ala told CoinDesk: ""Over time, hopefully it will give insight into micropayments as a spam-prevention mechanism.""  But some of the concepts for lightning go far beyond solving problems that already exist today.  For instance, one of the most ambitious early lightning adopters is the AI imaging company CloudSight, whose CEO believes lightning will pave the way for allowing autonomous machines to make small, instant payments to one another.  Why would machines need to pay each other? According to founder and CEO Brad Folkens, autonomous cars could pay each other for tiny bits of data, such as fuel price and traffic conditions. And that's just one use case.  Right now, Cloudsight is using lightning for something simpler (and fun). The company recently began accepting lightning payments for customers who want to use their AI API. Customers send images to the API, which spits out a caption generated by an AI.  ""This new tool can now enable advanced value interactions for an exchange of information that was previously impossible,"" Folkens said.  Getting there  Still, while it might seem like everyone should be flocking to lightning because of its perks, there's still one big downside – it's a complex setup.  As it relates to Cloudsight's application, the instructions for paying with lightning are quite long, asking users to spin up a bitcoin node well over 100 gigabytes, which is a considerable storage requirement.  It's a far cry from the convenience of PayPal – input some personal information and a credit card number and start spending.  Despite this and other hurdles that might appear as the network gets real usage, the hope is that lightning will grow easier to use as the technology matures – much like bitcoin has become since its release.  Someday, maybe even easy enough that users can buy exclamation points and photo captions without blinking an eye. And that's the bitcoin that many of the industry's first enthusiasts are looking forward to.  As Chris Stewart, a contributor to the bitcoin software, tweeted recently:  ""Lightning fits the bill for how bitcoin was advertised in 2013.""

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had fallen to $6,138 Wednesday at 16:00 UTC – its lowest level in 26 days, according to Bitfinex data. Yet, bitcoin's price was last seen at $6,500, up 5 percent from its most recent low.  What to make of the move? Clearly, investors did not want to miss a small opportunity in the form of a pullback that started August 1 and lasted all of 10 trading days.  Supporting the view is that the broader market has seen an uptick as well, best depicted by the total crypto market capitalization, up $10 billion on the day where its value currently stands at $235 billion.  As a result, other well-known cryptocurrencies are posting gains. Names like ethereum (ETH), EOS (EOS) and bitcoin cash (BCH) have each appreciated by at least 3% percent over the last 24-hours.

Also worth noting is that the MACD indicator, which identifies trend changes and momentum, has printed its first bullish sign in 10 days after ticking up slightly back toward the neutral zero line.  But while all of that is true, the relative strength index (RSI) is approaching well-known resistance at 45.92. Further, the exponential moving averages (EMA 21-day and 55-day) have crossed, sending a mixed signal that would otherwise see prices fall and are requiring backing from other indicators, which currently show bullish.

42401760,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2LuX,1533864602,"Google Search Can Predict Bitcoin Price Increases, Study Finds","A recent study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) suggests that cryptocurrency markets move depending on the type of attention they receive – unlike traditional financial markets.  In contrast with other traditional financial assets, cryptocurrencies don't behave or respond to the same set of market factors as traditional financial instruments but instead, move more closely with ""cryptocurrency specific factors,"" according to the non-profit's report, which was published this week.  These factors include investor attention and market momentum, described as the ""time-series cryptocurrency momentum at the daily and weekly frequencies.""  The paper's authors, Yale University economists Yukun Liu and Aleh Tsyvinski, suggest that, contrary to public opinion, ""the markets do not view cryptocurrencies similarly to standard asset classes.""  The paper cited CoinDesk's bitcoin, ethereum and XRP price trackers (referring to XRP as ""ripple"") as the source of its market data. Using price data series over multi-year time frames, the paper compared actual returns to the projected returns using a standard finance pricing model known as the CAPM.  Liu and Tsyvinski go on to compare cryptocurrency returns to that of traditional currencies such as the euro, metals like gold and macroeconomic factors such as consumption growth.  All of these result in statistically insignificant findings, suggesting a stronger narrative in other proxies, which Liu and Tsyvinski identify as the measure of returns a day or week prior.  Essentially, the price increase across one, three, five or six days could be predicted by a single daily return, while a weekly return could predict a one, two, three or four-week market movement.  Notably, this study incorporates data from consumer activity on search forums such as Google and social media sites such as Twitter. It found that a standard deviation increase in searches for keywords such as ""bitcoin"" forecasted a small increase in the token's price in the following weeks.  On average, a single standard deviation increase in the keyword search lead to a 2.75 percent price increase, according to the report.  Similarly, a standard deviation increase in Twitter post counts resulted in a 2.5 percent increase in bitcoin's price.  On the other hand, a standard deviation increase in the terms ""bitcoin hack"" forecasted a small decrease in bitcoin's price.
