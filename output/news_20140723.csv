42425917,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6Ph,1406153405,Auction of Bitcoins.com Domain Name Halted By US Court,"A restraining order issued by the US District Court of Seattle has resulted in the cancellation of the anticipated auction of the Bitcoins.com domain name.  The domain name, currently owned by Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles through his company Tibanne KK was expected to be auctioned by US-based auction house Heritage Auctions on 24th July. However, bitcoin startup CoinLab – which recently agreed to support Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy plan – moved to prevent the sale.  Tibanne KK has been ordered to preserve and account for all held assets, which includes the Bitcoins.com domain name. In a statement, CoinLab lawyer Roger Townsend indicated that the company, while supportive of the bankruptcy proceedings, would not allow the sale of its assets without permission.  Townsend remarked:  ""We are pleased that the court entered an order requiring Tibanne to preserve and account for all of its assets, including any ownership it might have in Mt Gox, domain names or payments that it has received since the bankruptcy. This TRO sends a strong message to Tibanne that they cannot dissipate assets without the court’s approval.""  CoinDesk reached out to Heritage Auctions regarding the court order, but has not received an immediate response. The auction appears to be on-schedule for its original launch date according to the Heritage auction page for the Bitcoins.com sale.  CoinLab was originally contracted to provide services to Mt. Gox customers in the US and Canada. However, this relationship ended when CoinLab sued the company for failing to provide it with the resources to carry out its mandate. Mt. Gox later countersued, and neither lawsuit has been formally resolved.  Auction bad for bankruptcy  In court documents, CoinLab argued that the domain name auction would have a significantly negative impact on Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy process – and the ability for creditors to recoup lost funds.  The district court agreed with the company, saying:  ""There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the court’s ability to grant effective final relief for plaintiff in the form of damage and monetary restitution will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment or other disposition or concealment by defendant Tibanne KK of their assets or records, unless Tibanne KK is immediately restrained and enjoyed by this order.”  The order went on to state that it is “in the public interest” to prohibit Tibanne KK and any of its employees from taking any action that might affect control or ownership of the company’s assets.  The restraining order will expire in 14 days, after which time an extension will be considered by the court.

42425928,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6jh,1406145610,Perianne Boring: Regulators Will Decide Bitcoin's Fate Within 18 Months,"The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) kicked off this weekend with the surprise launch of the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), a new lobbying group that aims to advocate for smart bitcoin regulation in Washington, DC through a three-part strategy combining government relations, media education and grassroots outreach.  Helmed by president and former Forbes columnist Perianne Boring, the CDC aspires to operate a $1.5m annual budget and will feature an advisory board composed of experienced regulators, former members of Congress and early Internet advocates.  While the CDC's statements suggest it has the tools at hand to move bitcoin's agenda forward in Washington, in a new interview with CoinDesk, Boring stressed that all these resources won't make up for the one that is slowly dwindling – time.  Boring told CoinDesk that she formed the CDC because she believes the industry must act now or risk having its innovative potential stamped out by harmful policies:  ""I give bitcoin 12 to 18 months before its fate will be decided by lawmakers. We don't have a lot of time to tackle these issues, and if we don't, bitcoin will be narrowed down to a hobbyist niche and not a true industry.""  Boring added that New York's new proposed regulations are an example of why bitcoin so badly needs better representation in government. These decisions, she said, are being made now, and more troubling, they're being made without the support of an authoritative group representing the industry.  ""That's a huge problem. We absolutely do want to slow down these regulations,"" she said. ""Small businesses are going to be really hurt by this onerous regulation.""  The CDC issued a new press releasehttp://www.freebanking.org/2014/07/23/ny-regs-threaten-bitcoin-and-digital-currencies/ today encouraging consumers to submit comments to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to fight what it called a regulatory framework that would severely debilitate the digital currency industry.  Called to action  A member of the University of Florida's Class of 2010, Boring has quickly built a reputation in the bitcoin industry and on Capitol Hill, where she served as both an intern for the White House and as a financial services, tax, healthcare and education analyst for Florida Representative Dennis Ross.  Boring later became captivated by bitcoin, an interest she pursued as a journalist prior to forming the CDC. It's this unique combination of experiences, Boring says, that gives her the credentials and passion to champion bitcoin in Washington.  ""When I went into journalism, bitcoin was a topic I covered very closely, and through my time in journalism I fell in love with bitcoin and decided that this was what I wanted to do and I didn't want to do it as a journalist,"" Boring explained. ""I wanted to have an integral role, and as someone who had just came from the HIll I saw there was a huge need for this, and I didn't see anyone else who could do it.""  Despite optimism that bitcoin's perception in Washington is shifting as more politicians publicly support the technology, Boring indicated that she believes this is wishful thinking, saying:  ""There's nobody else in DC that cares about bitcoin, bitcoin has a terrible reputation, people are scared to touch it, nobody wants to be involved with it, and a lot of it is a lack of understanding.""  She also addressed any critics of her new role, saying: ""Politics sometimes is not fun. It's a lot of name-calling. It's a cutthroat town, but it's extremely important. It should show how much I care about bitcoin that I care to do this because it's very difficult.""  The case for the CDC  What makes the work so tough, Boring says, is that American politicians are still struggling to understand bitcoin and its related technologies, particularly just how widely applicable they are to various government entities.  A list of House and Senate committees the CDC plans to target names 11 groups – including the House Energy & Commerce Committee and Senate Committee on Agriculture – in addition to various federal and state regulatory agencies such as the Department of Justice and Federal Reserve.  Having the CDC operate full-time in Washington, Boring says, will give bitcoin a way to both educate and support these groups, one that she contends is lacking today.  ""If I worked on the Hill and Western Union had come to me and said, 'Bitcoin is terrible and we need to ban it', and we needed to contact bitcoin to get their side of the story, who would I call?""  Boring contends that while a few firms – like bitcoin's chief trade organisation, the Bitcoin Foundation, and bitcoin hedge fund Falcon Global Capital – have hired lobbyists, these organizations are limited as they also represent other interests.  She added: ""We really want to be a resource for public policy makers, government employees and also the press. A place where they can call and get straight answers to just basic questions so they can form smart regulation and cover the industry in a responsible way.""  Building grassroots efforts  In addition to educating government entities and media outlets, the CDC also plans to establish and support grassroots-level intiatives, leveraging bitcoin's enthusiastic and growing user base as part of its outreach.  Boring outlined one such example of how this strategy will be put into action, saying:  ""We'll be looking to build grassroots support, encouraging people to call Congress and call their regulators and ask them 'Are you accepting bitcoin donations?' or 'What is your stance on bitcoin?' so we can start getting this dialogue moving.""  Key to this effort will be building the narrative that bitcoin is good for the US economy. The CDC, in its official launch release, suggested it believes the digital currency industry will generate $1tn annually within six years, growth that will impact companies and communities.  Boring noted that companies like Overstock have propelled the merchant market to recent growth, and that such a strategy should be pursued more broadly, stating:  ""The community is very lucky to have such a great organization that's gone to bat for us, but we need more of those. We need to find more companies like Overstock that can tell their story and give them a platform to tell their story as well.""  She said that such a push would in turn give greater confidence to more businesses and consumers, thus spurring consumer adopting and improved sentiment in Washington.  The CDC also aims to build trust in its organisation by being transparent about financing and how its money is spent.  Bitcoin Foundation response  Boring was also careful to frame her organisation's work in context of the Bitcoin Foundation, which to date has largely been digital currency's main advocacy body, both for the media and on Capitol Hill, although the agency has recently been marred by controversies.  Boring first addressed the relationship between the two groups during the CDC's unveiling at TNABC.    ""We're not related to the Bitcoin Foundation,"" @PerianneDC says of her new lobbying group, the Chamber of Digital Commerce #bitcoinchicago      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) July 19, 2014      However, she suggested that her group will support the Bitcoin Foundation's efforts indirectly by helping to grow bitcoin, saying:  ""There is so much work to do in Washington. That's why I welcome all initiatives because there's so much going on.""  Boring suggested that she first approached the Bitcoin Foundation with her proposal for the CDC, and that she was encouraged to pursue the project independently.

42425912,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh6Jh,1406144124,Barry Silbert Leads $250k Investment in Mexican Bitcoin Exchange Volabit,"Mexico-based bitcoin exchange Volabit has received $250,000 in new funding, an amount the company says will be used to further establish itself in the digital currency market.  The capital comes from Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, a investment vehicle headed by SecondMarket and Bitcoin Investment Trust CEO Barry Silbert. Speaking to CoinDesk, Silbert said that he is confident Volabit can gain the users it needs to target the country's underserved consumer market, and that his firm's investment is a reflection of this belief.  Silbert told CoinDesk:  ""Through the use of bitcoin, Volabit has the potential to radically transform the US-Mexico remittance corridor, one of the largest money transfer corridors in the world.""  Notably, Bitcoin Opportunity Corp invested the same amount in Sweden-based cryptocurrency exchange Safello two weeks ago. At the time, that was the largest investment the firm had made outside the US.  Volabit launched earlier this year under the name Coincove, and was in beta until May. The exchange officially opened at that time with the stated aim of becoming the 'Coinbase of Mexico'.  Pivoting from remittance  Volabit was created by former Carnegie Mellon students Hannah Kim and Tomas Melis. As Coincove, it took part in the Boost VC incubator program and developed a focus on remittances services in Latin America.  This focus has shifted to a certain extent, as certain markets like Argentina and the US proved problematic. These regulatory challenges forced Coincove to rethink its approach and put remittances on the backburner.  Volabit co-founder Hannah Kim explained:  ""While testing the first version of our service, we came to the realization that the cash collection infrastructure essential to a bitcoin-based remittance system was out of reach for bitcoin companies. This is in part due to the unclear regulatory environment, especially at a state-by-state level where money licensing laws apply.""  The company is now keen to enter another niche in Mexico by providing affordable financial services to consumers that lack access to banking, though Kim says, here too, its target markets will require a unique approach:  ""In-person, cash transactions for bitcoin may sound counterintuitive, but given that most of the target population do not have bank accounts and are risk-averse when it comes to sending money, it makes sense that they would not interact with bitcoins in the way that’s familiar to the bitcoin-savvy crowd.""  She added: ""The confluence of all these factors makes it very difficult, at this time, for anyone to develop a service that the target market would use.""  Finding opportunities  Despite these challenges, Kim notes that Volabit is optimistic that advances on the US regulatory front will eventually allow the company to achieve its original goal of providing low-cost remittances.  In the meantime, Kim told CoinDesk that there are numerous opportunities beyond remittances for Volabit to seek, especially in Latin America:  ""In Mexico, for instance, loans and credit are very expensive, credit card adoption is very low. [The lack of] access to competitive financial services inhibits the people living in countries with such conditions – the underbanked population in particular. Bitcoin, however, has the potential to transform this situation by increasing the choices available to those living in countries whose financial systems are very localized by connecting them to the global economy.""  Volabit says the new investment will fuel product development efforts on these fronts. The company is currently developing a partnership with a peer-to-peer lending company to bring low-rate loans to Mexico.

42425907,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Zh,1406140266,World’s First Airline to Accept Bitcoin Misses a Big Opportunity,"Neil Murray is an entrepreneur and writer involved in the Nordic and European startup scene. He runs The Nordic Web, a content and data provider, alongside VIP VoIP, an event series which connects local startup ecosystems with global tech players. Here, he discusses the perks of bitcoin as both a marketing tool and a cheaper transaction method.  This week, Latvia’s national airline, airBaltic, confirmed that it is now accepting bitcoin, and that in doing so, it became the first airline that accepts bitcoin directly, rather than through a third party.    Indeed, it's true - we have become the world’s 1st airline to accept @Bitcoin as payment for flights when booking at http://t.co/7Bh1qCedds      — airBaltic (@airBaltic) July 22, 2014          This is a positive move for those that want bitcoin to evolve into a mainstream currency that can be used for the purchase of everyday goods and utilities, and it could lead competitors to also offer a bitcoin payment option. The immediate knock-on effect could be that Expedia will start accepting bitcoin for flight bookings, in addition to hotel bookings that you can already make with the cryptocurrency.  By becoming the first airline to accept bitcoin, airBaltic has surely stolen a march on everybody else. However, the firm has missed a trick. The dreaded transaction fee.  Yes, even when booking a flight with bitcoin, the transaction fee is €5.99.  AirBaltic explained:  ""The transaction fee is to cover the costs associated with processing and handling the booking rather than the bitcoin itself.""  Yet, a processing and handling fee typically is meant to cover costs from processing the payment. So, where in this case there is practically none, it is not clear why this expense still applies. Surely, the handling of the booking itself would already be accounted for in its salaries and expenses, as this is the main purpose and reason for the business's existence, so it would seem pretty odd not to have this factored into its costs already.  There is no transaction fee when using an airBaltic card, for example, which demonstrates that the main purpose of these fees are deterrents, aimed to encourage customers to avoid other payment methods and to take advantage of the benefits of being an airBaltic cardholder.  Having broken ground in becoming the first airline to accept bitcoin, it makes no sense to essentially deter people from using it. Otherwise it is no more than a publicity stunt, which to be fair to them has done the airline pretty well so far already, with the bitcoin community buzzing about this news.  AirBaltic was quick to spot a big opportunity with bitcoin, I just hope they don’t let an even bigger one pass them by.

42425888,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh15h,1406133891,ZipZap Expands Bitcoin Buying Service to 34 European Countries,"Transaction network ZipZap has announced that consumers across 34 European countries will soon have access to its cash-to-bitcoin services.  The company says consumers will be able to use its platform to purchase digital currency, pay bills for their relatives in other countries, alongside a host of other services. ZipZap offers free sign up, free wallet and free deposit services.  The expansion comes just months after the company announced plans to enter the Latin American market.  CEO Alan Safahi spoke to CoinDesk back in April to explain his vision for the future of innovative payment services in emerging markets and developed economies.  Simplifying payments worldwide  ZipZap says it has already developed strategic partnerships across Europe in order to facilitate the expansion. It now accepts cash and bank transfers from networks including: GiroPay, SEPA, SOFORT, iDeal and MisterCash.  The company has experienced issues with its payment processors in the past. Earlier this year it was forced to suspend services in the UK after its payment processor PayPoint said it needed more clarification on the regulations surrounding bitcoin.  However, it did not take long for the company to secure a new partner, PayZone, and resume operations in the country.  “ZipZap has a commitment to simplify and democratise payments worldwide,” said Simon Nahnybida, senior vice president of business development for ZipZap.  “We are now enabling more consumers with the power to easily, safely and securely buy digital currencies at affordable prices using multiple payment options.”  Over the counter  ZipZap is not the first platform to target over-the-counter transactions. London's first bitcoin voucher shop, Azteco, opened earlier this year on the edge of the city’s financial district. Customers hand the shop's attendant cash to receive a voucher code that can be redeemed at the Azteco website – minus a 3% commission.  Further afield, bitcoin users in Ukraine can now utilise a network of more than 4,900 payment terminals to convert their cash into digital currency all over the country. The machines, known as BNK-24 terminals, also allow customers to pay utility bills and purchase mobile phone credit.  BTCU, the company behind the service, charges 3.5% commission on each transaction – citing pent-up demand for a cheaper, more convenient payment system to settle overseas e-commerce transactions.

42425892,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Bh,1406130025,Bitcoin Sign-Ups for Intuit QuickBooks 'Higher than Expected',"While bitcoin's headlines are often dominated by large merchants like Dell, DISH and Overstock, broader business adoption of the technology as a payments solution may be more arguably influenced by the various platform providers serving the space.  Companies like e-commerce enabler Shopify and more recently financial software specialist Intuit, for example, now allow thousands of small merchants to begin accepting bitcoin.  Launched in late June, Intuit's PayByCoin offering saw the company adding bitcoin to its QuickBooks Online payment processing service, so that small businesses could invoice customers in bitcoin.  Now, in a new interview with CoinDesk, Intuit engineer Clinton Nielsen has confirmed that PayByCoin is already gaining traction with the company's small business customers, and that despite bitcoin's sometimes negative press, the response to the program has been largely positive to date.  Nielsen told CoinDesk:  ""The only thing I heard was one customer said they'd rather having us focus on things that are right now rather than things that are far-reaching, but the overwhelmingly positive attitude from the media in general and our customers has drowned that out.""  He added that the data further supports this conclusion, saying: ""We've seen more sign-ups than we expected"".  The California-based company earned $4.2bn in revenue during fiscal year 2013, and has a team of roughly 8,000 employees around the globe, according to its fiscal year 2013 investor filing.  Bringing PayByCoin to market  The product of both Nielsen and Intuit's Group Product Manager Manish Shah, PayByCoin was a project the two developers developed on during their allotted 'whitespace time' – the 10% of working time all Intuit employees get to spend on initiatives of their choosing.  Shah said that the pair used this time to form a small team for the project, adding:  ""Once we identitied invoice payments as a good starting point to do this integration, we coded out the necessary pieces with Coinbase. We have an established program at Intuit called Intuit Labs, which allows small teams like us to take ideas to market quickly, and that's how it was done.""  In response to questions about the reaction of Intuit management to the product, Nielsen said that, on an ideological level, he saw bitcoin as aligning with the goals of the company:  ""Intuit is aiming to change how people manage their finances, and bitcoin is looking to change how people look at money at a more fundamental level. I don't there's been any question that the Intuit family of products and bitcoin could be complementary to each other.""  Small business outlook  Although Intuit is optimistic about the applications of bitcoin in its own products, Shah said that he still feels as though the small business market is only just warming to digital currency.  Shah indicated that he believes the positive response has been due to the volume of early adopters that are using PayByCoin, as these individuals are generally enthusiastic about new technologies.  The broader small business market, he said, will likely be harder to win:  ""The majority of businesses that have heard about bitcoin are sitting on the sidelines because they are worried about currency fluctuation, who will pay them in bitcoin. [...] A lot of small businesses are skeptical about adoption, just like any new technology.""  Bitcoin development continues  Shah further confirmed that more Intuit employees are seeking to develop bitcoin products during their whitespace time, and that these initiatives aim to leverage some of the less mainstream applications of the technology.  There is a particular interest in how smart contracts and other such technologies could be used for businesses. he said, adding:  ""Financial transactions are just one of the use cases [for bitcoin], but you think about small businesses that have interactions with customers, vendors and employees, and you think about all these other products that focus on establishing the ownership of [for example] a document or any other kind of resources. There are lots of places in the products at Intuit where we could integrate some of those solutions.""  Nielsen went on to say that should any of these whitespace products be given the green light, they would still be molded to fit Intuit's overall business objectives.  ""The goal is always to make it as invisible for small businesses as possible, so they can go about running their business"", he said.

42425897,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Lh,1406121490,6 New Hedge Funds Seeking Bitcoin Returns,"It's been a bumper year for bitcoin hedge funds. While the entry of big money from Wall Street into the bitcoin markets is discussed with equal measures of glee and rage in the community, some big-money financiers are already making moves in the cryptocurrency markets.  We're not talking about Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Investment Trust or the Winklevoss twins’ bitcoin index fund. No, there's a new class of funds running money for wealthy individuals, families and institutions, aimed to get these sophisticated investors into the bitcoin game.  Here's a roundup of the new bitcoin funds so far:  Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund  The Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, which goes by the catchy acronym GABI, has claimed the title of the world's first regulated bitcoin hedge fund. That said, it's regulated in Jersey, the British Crown dependancy that is one of the world's top tax havens. The fund is due to launch on 1st August, according to Newsweek, and will seek clients in the UK, Europe and the Middle East.  The GABI Fund is run by Daniel Masters, a former energy trader at Shell and JP Morgan, where he rose to run its global energy trading division in the late nineties. In 1999, Masters also co-founded Global Advisors, a Jersey-based commodities hedge fund.  The new fund hasn't made public its planned fund size, or its likely trading approach, but Newsweek's Leah McGrath Goodman reports that Masters is bullish on bitcoin's long-term future and is attracted to the money-making opportunities in its current price volatility.  So what does regulation mean for GABI? According to the Jersey Financial Services Commission, ""certified funds"" like GABI must adhere to a code of practice established by the regulator that are designed to protect clients. This includes demonstrating the existence of financial resources and adequate insurance, setting up risk-management systems and being subject to future guidance from the commission.  Future guidance for bitcoin funds will be forthcoming, as the commission's Financial Crime Strategy Group is due to make recommendations on the risks linked to cryptocurrencies by the end of the year.  Pantera Capital  Pantera Capital brings some serious Wall Street pedigree to the table. The fund, which buys bitcoin as an asset, but also acts as a venture capital backer to bitcoin startups, is packed with a roster of high-profile names from high finance. Its principal is Dan Moreheadhttps://panteracapital.com/about/, a former chief financial officer and head of macro trading at the legendary hedge fund Tiger Management.  Pantera's fund size is about $150m, which is three times larger than SecondMarket's Bitcoin Investment Trust, according to regulatory filings. It's fuelled by money from large institutional investors like Fortress Investment Group and venture capital firms Benchmark Capital and Ribbit Capital. Pantera also counts Mt. Gox and Ripple creator Jed McCaleb among its executives.  The firm put its sizable bankroll to use in search of early-stage company deal flow – even flying bitcoin startups to Lake Tahoe in private jets to be wined and dined, according to Bloomberg News. Pantera emerged as a backer of current top exchange (in terms of US dollar trading) Bitstamp, having put in $10m.  It's unclear how well Pantera has done with its bitcoin holdings so far. However, we do know that Fortress lost some $3.7m on a $20m bitcoin investment in 2013, according to The Wall Street Journal, before throwing its cryptocurrency lot in with Pantera.  Bitcoins Reserve  One group of traders hoping to cash in on the persistent price differences among various bitcoin exchanges is Bitcoins Reserve. Calling itself a ""cryptocurrency arbitrage fund"", Bitcoins Reserve hopes to buy low on one exchange and sell high on another, using automated trading software that it has developed itself.  The fund, a subsidiary of a British Virgin Island-incorporated firm called Chesham Group Ltd, says in its prospectus that it has returned 765% in the 12 months ending April 2014, beating bitcoin's price movement by more than 200 points.  Bitcoins Reserve is a relative minnow compared to other companies in this article; saying it wants to have just $5m under management by year's end. The firm hasn't publicly disclosed its current fund size. It's worth noting that Bitcoins Reserve was the victim of a phishing attack earlier this month, losing 100 BTC to the scam.  Binary Financial  This San Francisco-based fund began to build a public profile when it was named as an investor in ASIC manufacturer BitFury's hefty $20m round at the end of May. The firm is stocked with technology startup pedigree, with Jonathan Teo, who led investments in Twitter and Instagram, as a partner at Benchmark Capital, holding the post of chairman.  Binary also trades on its own account and for clients, however, deploying a range of trading strategies, including arbitrage, according to managing partner Harry Yeh, who's based in Vancouver. Yeh wouldn't say how much he has under management, although he said the fund's clients tended to be accredited investors.  Coin Capital Partners  Another hedge fund that's making big investor promises is New York-based Coin Capital Partners. The fund launched in May, promising ""hedge fund industry best practices"" and ""investment grade"" exposure to bitcoin.  Coin Capital intends to court accredited investors under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and says it employs a straightforward buy-and hold-strategy for investors with a ""long-term bullish stance"" on the bitcoin price.  The firm is run by Samuel Cahn, a lawyer and investment manager who previously managed an arbitrage fund, who told trade title FINAlternatives that his fund has been seeded from a family office. His partners in the fund are brothers Sigmund and Drew Sommer.  Coin Capital has not disclosed its fund size.  Falcon Global Capital  Falcon Global Capital  is bringing both financial firepower and its powers of professional persuasion to bear for its clients. The firm, which isn't a wheeling and dealing hedge fund, but rather an asset management vehicle for investors to buy and hold bitcoins, has also launched a lobbying initiative on Capitol Hill to raise awareness of bitcoin among legislators. Falcon's co-founder is Brett Stapper, himself a federally registered lobbyist.  Falcon, like the other funds listed here, targets accredited investors looking to buy relatively big chunks of bitcoin, but who don't want the hassle of procuring the coins themselves, or the risk of losing them through a security oversight.

42425902,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1Th,1406115029,"Ethereum Launches Own 'Ether' Coin, With Millions Already Sold","Yesterday, at midnight (CEST), Ethereum launched the presale of its much-anticipated, platform-specific altcoin, ether.  The surprise announcement caused something of a stir in the community and the response has been extremely positive, with over 7 million ether (ETH) sold after approximately 12 hours.  Switzerland-based Ethereum and The Ethereum Project have made headlines this past year as potentially exciting examples of 'Cryptocurrency 2.0', a term that refers to new applications built upon block chain technology.  Ethereum is both a platform and a programming language that is aimed to make it possible for developers to build and publish applications that do not require trust in third parties to run.  Ether is commonly referred to as the ‘cryptofuel’ that runs the applications on Ethereum’s decentralized network. In practice, ether will be required by anyone wishing to build upon or use the Ethereum platform, and are, at this time, mostly suitable for people looking to develop or distribute decentralized applications  People have been waiting since Ethereum’s announcement in January at Miami’s North American Bitcoin Conference to purchase the tokens.  Funding development  According to Ethereum  , those purchasing ether now will lock in their supply at a known price, even though the actual coins will not be available until the genesis block is mined, sometime in the winter of 2014-2015.  While this makes this sale look like a crowdfunding operation, the company maintains it is a pre-sale event for a product, with funds going towards financing the continued development of the software platform.  “You are trusting us to take the bitcoin and use it to develop Ethereum,” said Buterin. “But we hope that after watching our development for six months you have been convinced that we are technically capable of pulling this off.”  Ether can currently be purchased at a set rate of 2,000 ETH per 1 bitcoin. The price will stay at this rate for two weeks and then linearly decrease in value down to 1,337 ETH per BTC. The sale will last 42 days in total.  Ethereum has made it clear that ether is not to be viewed as an investment like bitcoin and offered the following disclaimer on its blog:  ˝Ether is a product, NOT a security or investment offering. Ether is simply a token useful for paying transaction fees or building or purchasing decentralized application services on the Ethereum platform; it does not give you voting rights over anything, and we make no guarantees of its future value.˝  Block chain vision  Ethereum is the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, a former college student who, fascinated with bitcoin, spent a year traveling around the world and learning about the possibilities of the technology.  Buterin saw that all the various block chain projects were focused on developing altcoins with varying features, but that this was a limitation of the block chain’s potential. So he eventually came up with Ethereum, which offers a way for people to connect through trustless distributed applications on its own block chain.  Besides Ethereum, Buterin has been involved in several notable projects including Bitcoin Magazine, Dark Wallet and KryptoKit. He was also recently awarded a Thiel Fellowship, with an accompanying $100,000 to put towards his current and future projects.  The company’s primary base is in Zug, Switzerland, but it has additional bases in Toronto and London, with more to come. The organization spans the globe, however, with communities and meetups in Canada, the US, Asia and even Africa. “We are a geographically distributed organization,” Buterin explained.  The choice to base Ethereum in Switzerland was an easy one: the country is known for its cryptocurrency-friendly regulatory environment and accessibility to government officials.

42425910,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIh1dh,1406110622,Mt. Gox Creditors' Meeting Delivers Few Answers and One Apology,"Today's long-anticipated meeting between Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi and creditors from the defunct exchange provided several revelations, but left many more questions unanswered.  At the Tokyo meeting Kobayashi disclosed he would consider distributing the exchange's remaining funds as bitcoin, not Japan's native yen. He also revealed plans to meet with potential purchasers of Mt. Gox's remaining assets.  Over 100 creditors, the large majority of whom were Japanese, filed into the meeting room of Tokyo's District Court to hear Kobayashi speak live on the matter for the first time.  Kobayashi spent 25 minutes running through the details of the case, followed by a question-and-answer session that continued for another 90 minutes. All proceedings were in Japanese, with non-Japanese attendees told to provide their own interpreters.  The court did, however, provide a written English summary of Kobayashi's update.  The apology  CEO Mark Karpeles was also present, sitting front and center. Occasionally glancing up from his desk, he remained silent other than to deliver a brief apology at the request of a creditor.  As well as his impromptu courtroom mea culpa, Karpeles also made a longer apology to Japan's Asahi Shimbun. Karpeles told the newspaper he wanted to use any future profits from Mt. Gox's parent company Tibanne to pay the exchange's creditors.  This was actually a suggestion made by creditors present in the meeting, who were also presented with an itemized list of unpaid loans from Mt. Gox to Tibanne and its other affiliate entities including the Bitcoin Cafe, which totalled ¥1.17bn ($11.54m).  Some rays of hope  Regarding the remaining 200,000 bitcoins, Kobayashi said several people had approached him to ask if they could be distributed to creditors as bitcoins. While he couldn't give any guarantees, he said he would attempt to do this if it were legally possible.  He asked attendees who preferred bitcoin to raise their hands. About 70-80% of the crowd did so, prompting applause – the only outbreak of emotion in the courtroom during the session.  Kobayashi also stated he would be meeting with parties interested in purchasing Mt. Gox's remaining assets in the hope of continuing the business somehow. He would meet each group individually and assess each bid on its merits, including whether they had previous involvement with bitcoin or not.  He did not, however, present any deadline or formal timeframe in which this could happen.  What happened to the bitcoins?  Of particular interest to the creditors was the investigation, or lack thereof, into the disappearance of roughly 850,000 BTC from Mt. Gox's reserves that drove the company into bankruptcy.  Throughout the procedings Kobayashi and the court gave little impression of understanding bitcoin, nor its workings and related issues. The answers ""that's still under investigation"" or ""that's confidential"" were frequent responses to bitcoin-related questions.  Another recurrent answer was that the court could not reveal any information capable of jeopardizing the investigation or increasing risk for parties involved – which seemed to include any information regarding Mt. Gox's missing or present bitcoins.  One attendee asked why, given bitcoin's public ledger, a forensic analysis could not reveal more about February's supposed heist.  Another asked why Kobayashi had retained two accounting firms, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and ReEx Accounting, to investigate the disappearance rather than deploying the kind of computer security resources available to the FBI or Interpol.  Both questions were met with the response ""it's still under investigation"". Both accounting firms had been chosen for their reputable statuses in the field, Kobayashi said.  Reactions from creditors  After the meeting, most creditors expressed a general dissatisfaction with the way the court was investigating the disappearance of Mt. Gox's funds and disseminating information to those who lost money – particularly the large majority of customers who reside outside Japan.  Kolin Burges, a creditor who famously stood in the snow outside Gox's office to protest the company's freezing of customer funds in February, said he was ""very very disappointed"" with the investigation's slow progress and remained suspicious of amounts loaned and invoiced to other companies under the control of Mark Karpeles.  He said:  ""What about the fiat money that disappeared in March? It seems like they haven't done anything. With the bitcoins, they won't even give us the address.""  Some were relieved that the court would not be liquidating the company and selling its remaining funds on the open market.  Daniel Kelman, a lawyer involved with the new BitOcean bid to buy Gox's assets and continue the business in the interests of creditors, told CoinDesk:  ""We want the bitcoins distributed as bitcoins. Also he (Kobayashi) wants to talk to creditors, and that's good. If not, we should be forming a creditors' committee.""  Reactions from international visitors  Ben Kraus, a bitcoin miner who traveled from Thailand to attend the meeting, said he was disappointed by the lack of a translator, and that he'd ""naively expected they'd cater a bit more to the English speakers"".  He remained positive however, adding:  ""I think we share everyone's happiness that they're not just selling the bitcoins [...] it could be a good sign, if we get some of them back five years down the road.""  Sylvain Goupil, a creditor who had traveled from France but spoke Japanese, demanded a more open investigation into the missing bitcoins.  He asked:  ""Who will represent us? Will the police continue to investigate? If something is found later, or if there's a leak, can we still find out? Should the Bitcoin Foundation volunteer to represent us? At the very least, we should know the bitcoin addresses. What are the police even doing?""  ""If we'd had the information in time, maybe we could have looked at other exchanges, maybe identified the flow of money before it was all lost.""  Georg, a creditor who came from Germany for the meeting, told CoinDesk he had the misfortune of being sick the week Mt Gox closed, preventing him from withdrawing his funds as planned.  Having predicted bitcoin's bubbles and traded skillfully to build his nest egg, like many others Georg is now cut off from his funds. Describing the amount he lost on Mt. Gox, he revealed it was: ""A lot. Not something you can just earn back.""    Documents distributed at the Mt.
