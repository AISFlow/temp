42399501,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjcDI,1483055276,Ether Classic Surges to More Than 4-Month High,"The digital currency ether classic (ETC) surged more than 30% on 29th December, reaching its highest price in over four months.  ETC, the signature token of smart contract-based platform Ethereum Classic, rose to as much as $1.46 during the session, a 31.5% increase from the currency’s opening price of $1.11, CoinMarketCap data reveals. Ethereum itself grew by as much as 13.7% today.  Ethereum classic also benefited from a sharp increase in transaction activity, as 24-hour trading volume climbed above $7.6m, after falling below $500,000 at some points over the last week.  Several market observers have voiced doubts about the long-term viability of ETC and Ethereum Classic, a blockchain that came into existence in late July after Ethereum underwent a hard fork in order to wind back the clock following the rise and fall of distributed organization The DAO.  There have been concerns about Ethereum Classic's ability to draw significant interest from developers.  While ETC reached an all-time high of $3.53 in the first few weeks following its listing on CoinMarketCap and Poloniex, its price has dropped sharply since then, trading below $1 for almost all of November.  This one-day price surge provides advocates of ETC with one more positive sign that both the currency and its platform will survive for the long haul.

42399518,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjcN8,1483020051,Crypto Security in 2016: A Tale of Two Weaknesses,"Bill Shihara is the CEO and co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex, and a former security engineer at Amazon, Blackberry and Microsoft.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Shihara reviews the major cybersecurity events in the industry this year, drawing clear trends that could inform firms and individuals seeking to better protect their funds in 2017.  Bitfinex, The DAO, Gatecoin...  Security has always been a concern in the bitcoin and larger cryptocurrency community, and unsurprisingly, there was no shortage of malicious attacks on industry companies in 2016.  This year, we saw several hacks on major business that suggest malicious attackers are likely to continue to be a threat to cryptocurrency startups, putting users and investors in the blockchain industry at risk.  As startups and investors prepare for 2017, let's look at some of the major incidents in the hope that hackers will have less luck in the year ahead.  First Half of 2016: Centralized Services Attacked  Centralized services (or large pools of cryptocurrencies) have always been enticing targets for hackers.  But what's notable is that the three cryptocurrency exchanges that were hacked during this period were compromised using very different methods. I would argue the development raises issues for customers trying to manage the risk of putting their digital assets in centralized services.  ShapeShift, for example, lost its own funds through multiple hacks by an insider, while both Gatecoin and Bitfinex lost user funds through external hacks (and have been working to repay their customers).  We can't forget the biggest hack of the year though: The DAO.  The DAO, a decentralized venture capital fund, raised approximately $150m in March from digital currency investors across the globe.  Unfortunately, the promise of smart contracts and ""code as law"" was put to the test when a hacker was able to use The DAO code to withdraw $50m worth of ethereum. Remember, smart contracts are software and not immune from logic bugs that can lead to security flaws.  Just as with putting your money into exchanges, you should think carefully about smart contracts and decentralized solutions, and how they work, to understand how your funds are protected.  Second Half of 2016: Individuals Targeted  As the services built in the cryptocurrency industry have raised the bar on security, hackers have moved on to easier targets, attacking individual users.  Even sophisticated bitcoin industry veterans like Bo Shen and Jered Kenna, as reported by Forbes, were not immune from this wave of hacks.  In the second half of 2016, several people in the cryptocurrency space had their phone numbers stolen. Hackers were able to ""socially engineer"" their phone carriers and convince support engineers to switch their phone number to one that the hacker controls.  This is particularly insidious because SMS text messages and phone numbers are used as an authentication mechanism by many services that you rely on daily such as Google, Facebook and a few cryptocurrency services.  In some cases, your phone can be used as a single factor to reset a password or otherwise get into an account. Your phone company protects your digital life with the cheapest labor they can find, and those support engineers don't always follow their security processes.  The best thing to do is to remove your phone number from any services that it may currently be tied to. Another best practice – although not always foolproof because your phone carrier may not follow their own security processes – is to put a password on your account and require that any SIM swap or carrier change only happen if valid identification is shown in a store.  On the topic of social engineering, be careful of where you put your credentials and any information about yourself – on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, for example.  Hackers can collect this information and use it to social engineer their way into your accounts. Think of the answers to your security questions and whether someone could determine them by looking at your Facebook profile.  And, obviously, if you are reusing the same username and passwords across multiple sites, you should consider alternatives. Use hardware- or device-based two-factor authentication on every site that supports it.  Keep in mind that there are fake sites designed to trick you into giving your credentials. Hackers routinely buy Adwords so that their malicious sites are at the top of web searches.  Looking to the Year Ahead: 2017  2016 was a big year for hackers, but 2017 doesn’t have to be that way.  By paying attention to trends and protecting your business and personal accounts with advanced protective measures, we can all benefit from a safer, more secure cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Yet, we're not exactly there yet. In 2017, I'm expecting the industry to heavily invest in privacy technology and identity solutions in blockchains.

42399497,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjcBK,1483016267,Hyperledger Adds 8 More Members to End 2016,"Open-source, business blockchain consortium Hyperledger has announced that eight new members have joined its ranks.  The new members represent a mixed bag of companies, ranging from a venture-backed startup, to a state-owned telecommunications firm.  In a year that saw the consortium run by the non-profit Linux Foundation grow to from zero to 100 members, the diverse additions serve a fitting closure.  Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf said in a statement:  ""2016 was a year of exploration, R&D and prototyping, we’re excited for 2017 to be the year we start to see case studies of the technology in production environments.""  The latest members are the non-profit subsidiary of venture-backed Factom, along with CA Technologies, Hashed Health, Koscom, LedgerDomain, Lykke and the Sovrin Foundation.  Last week, CoinDesk had reported the inclusion of the eighth member announced today, Switzerland telecommunications firm, Swisscom.  Also last week, a group of a dozen Hyperledger members participated in the first cross-ocean transaction of a virtual asset on the Fabric blockchain platform, even if it was just a virtual marble.

42399508,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjcKB,1483012805,2017's Big Question: Who Pays for the Blockchain?,"Wayne Vaughan is the CEO of Tierion, a proof engine that lets you prove the integrity of any data, file, or business process. He is the co-author of Chainpoint, a standard for linking data to the blockchain.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Wayne encourages buyers of blockchain technology to ask if their blockchain of choice is backed by stable ecosystem and ready for mission critical applications.  2016 saw the rise of the blockchain evangelist.  Not since the heady dotcom days have we seen so many experts hyping a new technology. But, amid the hype, little attention has been paid to an important question. Who pays for the blockchain?  This consideration is especially important to anyone evaluating blockchain technology for their organization.  The blockchain buzz began in 2015. Bitcoin’s association with illegal activities earned it a bad reputation. This led startups to brand themselves as blockchain companies. They promised to deliver the benefits of the ""technology behind bitcoin"" without the undesirable baggage. Most didn’t understand that the technology behind bitcoin has existed for years.  Bitcoin's success is a result of the network’s economic incentives.  This fundamental misunderstanding has led to much confusion and misinformation, including the popular notion that blockchain is a new type of distributed database where information persists forever and cannot be changed.  Data can't live forever if no one pays the bills. Before you blockchain your business, let's examine who pays for three popular blockchain platforms.  Bitcoin  Bitcoin is primarily used to route and store value.  Bitcoin works because miners earn money for running the network infrastructure. Remove this incentive and everything falls apart.  Most bitcoin developers own bitcoin, and thus have a stake in the network's success. Over $1bn in venture capital has been invested in bitcoin companies to date, which subsidizes platform development.  Most importantly, a complex circular economy has evolved over the past eight years that involves thousands of businesses all over the globe.  While some of bitcoin's $15bn market cap remains driven by speculation, much of it now comes from the people and businesses using bitcoin. Each of these participants bears a share of the cost of securing the bitcoin network.  Ethereum  Ethereum is a blockchain mainframe.  The network behaves as single computer. Anyone can rent, compute and store data on ethereum by paying for it in its native token, ether. Miners that maintain the network infrastructure are rewarded in ether, which can be exchanged for bitcoin and ultimately converted to fiat currency.  As with bitcoin, many ethereum developers own ether and have an interest in evangelizing the technology. Ethereum startups have received little funding from professional VCs relative to bitcoin startups.  Instead, the ethereum ecosystem has relied on speculation of the ether token and crowdfunding to finance projects.  So far, no circular economy has evolved around ethereum, but that’s to be expected since the network is just over one year old.  Ethereum's long-term growth is dependent on developing an ecosystem where companies consume ether at a rate that exceeds the cost of running the network.  Hyperledger  I think of Hyperledger as a new brand of enterprise software platform that shares design characteristics with bitcoin.  Its development is guided by group of companies that includes IBM, Intel and Airbus. The Hyperledger network infrastructure is paid for by customers in a traditional enterprise software licensing model.  The costs of running Hyperledger are likely similar to the costs of running a cloud application.  No surprises here.  Look both ways  There's a lot to consider before buying a blockchain.  Developers with blockchain expertise are rare and developer tools are immature. These factors increase security risks and make the cost of developing with blockchain higher than more mature technology stacks.  Smart companies clearly define the problem they're trying to solve before approaching blockchain vendors. When you do talk to vendors, you’ll likely be faced with unfamiliar jargon and grandiose promises.  Be sure to evaluate non-blockchain solutions. Ask if blockchain technology can enhance your existing technology stack.  And don’t forget to ask ""Who pays for the blockchain?"" Is it supported by a stable ecosystem and ready for mission critical applications? A clear understanding of the incentives and economy behind the blockchain can save you a lot of trouble.
