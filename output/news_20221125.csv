If the price of BNB fails to flip the region of $310 and gets rejected below $270, we could see more rejection in BNB price to a region of $200 and even lower. Daily resistance for the BNB price – $310. Daily support for the BNB price – $290-$270.

The top crypto fell to more than two-year low of $15.6K earlier this week and could potentially slide further. ""There's likely more to come from the FTX collapse and contagion effects, not to mention other scandals that could be uncovered. This may continue to make crypto traders very nervous and leave the foundations supporting price extremely shaky,"" said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam. Recent on-chain data from IntoTheBlock showed that 24.6M BTC addresses (~51%) were in negative territory , the largest share of ""out-of-the-money"" addresses since the start of the pandemic downturn. The global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $831.94B, down 0.26% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap . FTX fallout continues Sam Bankman-Fried, ex-CEO of FTX, ran the platform as his ""personal fiefdom"" , FTX counsel James Bromley reportedly said in the firm's first bankruptcy hearing. He added that a big portion of FTX's assets may have been stolen or has gone missing. It was also disclosed that FTX and affiliates held $1.24B cash - more than debtors disclosed. The company owed ~$3.1B to its 50 largest creditors. Turkey is the next country to step up scrutiny on FTX, with authorities seeking to seize the assets of Fried. Meanwhile, a Texas regulator launched a probe into whether celebrity endorsements of FTX violated securities laws. Venture capitalist Bradley Tusk told CNBC that venture capitalists will step up their due diligence in the future following the FTX meltdown. Genesis Global Capital, the crypto lending unit of brokerage Genesis, reportedly hired investment bank Moelis to explore how it can shore up its liquidity . Given its exposure to FTX, Genesis has been scrambling to raise cash and may need to file for bankruptcy protection . Regulatory news Amid growing calls for increased scrutiny of the crypto space, certain U.S. lawmakers reiterated that Fidelity Investments should reconsider letting retail clients put a portion of their savings into bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). A group of legislators also urged financial regulators to review SoFi's ( SOFI ) crypto trading activities, to which the firm responded by saying it is ""fully compliant"" with laws. Morgan Stanley believes the development raises the odds of SoFi ( SOFI ) exiting crypto entirely. New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed a two-year moratorium on Proof-of-Work mining, making it the first state to partially ban PoW mining. Bitcoin price Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dipped 0.32% to $16.53K at 2.40 pm ET, while ether ( ETH-USD ) fell 0.53% to $1.20K. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) appears to be forming a support level at ~$15.6K, but OANDA's Erlam said it is likely that the $10K level could be tested again in the days ahead. SA contributor Pinxter Analytics in a bearish analysis said there may not be a bottom to bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices as the crypto isn't backed by anything tangible. Conversely, The Digital Trend is bullish, but warned that it is a speculative investment . Cathie Wood, a long-time crypto bull, reiterated her forecast that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) price will reach $1M by 2030. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has taken a U-turn on his views on cryptos, saying they are ""here to stay"" .

4772876,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510093,1669402855,On-Chain Data Shows Signs Of Fresh Bitcoin Accumulation,"On-chain data shows signs of some fresh Bitcoin accumulation taking place during the last month. Bitcoin UTXOs Aged 1 Week To 1 Month Have Risen Up In Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, UTXOs purchased between 1 week and 1 month ago have risen since the FTX crash. The relevant indicator here is the “Realized Cap – UTXO Age Bands,” which tells us which age group has what percentage of the Bitcoin realized cap. The “realized cap” here refers to a type of BTC capitalization model in which the crypto’s cap is calculated by weighing each coin in the circulating supply against the price at which it was last moved, and then taking the sum for the entire supply. This capitalization method is different from the usual market cap, where all the coins are simply multiplied with the current BTC price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capitulation Deepens As aSOPR Metric Plunges To Dec 2018 Lows The “age bands” are groups that define the time period under which the UTXOs falling into it were last moved. For example, the “1m-3m” age band includes all UTXOs that haven’t shown any movement since between 1 and 3 months ago. Now, the age band of relevance in the current discussion is the “1w-1m” group. Here is a chart that shows how the realized cap contribution of this Bitcoin band has changed during the past couple of years: Looks like the value of the metric has been trending up recently | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the realized cap of the Bitcoin UTXOs falling into the 1w-1m band was in a decline during the bear market and had reached very low values by the time the FTX collapse rolled around. Since the crash, however, the age band has been observing a rapid uptrend. This means that there have been a large number of coins purchased between 1 week and 1 month ago.

BTC’s price bounces from a low of $15,500 on the daily timeframe as the price reclaims $16,500 as price struggles to break higher above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) The price action demonstrated by Bitcoin (BTC) in recent times has been better than the previous week as the market suffered from some price decline affecting most crypto assets. Despite the relief bounce from Bitcoin (BTC), the price still trades below the key region of interest that would attract the attention of many buyers.

Long-Term Holders Ramp Up Selling,"On-chain data shows Bitcoin long-term holders have ramped up their selling recently, something that could lead to further plunge in the crypto’s price. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow CDD Has Spiked Up Over The Last Day As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the current rise in the CDD is the largest since 6th October. A “Coin Day” is the quantity that 1 BTC accumulates after staying still for 1 day in a single address. If a coin that has amassed some number of Coin Days finally moves to another wallet, its Coin Days counter resets, and the Coin Days are said to be “destroyed.” The “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD) metric keeps note of the total number of such Coin Days being destroyed throughout the network on any given day. Another version of this indicator is the “exchange inflow CDD,” which measures only those Coin Days that were reset because of transactions to centralized exchanges. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflow CDD over the past month: The value of the metric seems to have spiked up during the last day or so | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange inflow CDD has shown a sharp rise in its value recently. There is a cohort in the BTC market called the “long-term holder” (LTH) group, which includes all investors who hold onto their coins for long periods without moving them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capitulation Deepens As aSOPR Metric Plunges To Dec 2018 Lows Because of the dormancy of their coins, thes LTHs accumulate a large numbers of Coin Days. As such, whenever these holders do move their coins, the CDD usually spikes up due to the scale of Coin Days involved. The current spike in the Bitcoin exchange inflow CDD thus suggests that some LTHs have deposited their coins to exchange wallets. As the exchanges in question are spot platforms, it’s possible that this movement of coins was made for selling purposes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shakes Off the Bears and Aims for $20,000 By End Of Year, Can It Make It? From the graph, it’s apparent that both the previous big spikes in the indicator were followed by declines in the price of Bitcoin. If the latest surge was also because of LTHs preparing to dump their coins, then the crypto is likely to observe bearish trend this time as well.

The community forked the project the following day to protect itself against a hack that took place on FTX, the token subsequently rallied by over 250%.  The majority of SRM trading volume takes place on Binance, according to CoinMarketCap, although the token is still listed on Kraken, Kucoin and Gate.io.  SRM was trading at $0.2704 as of press time, plunging by 7.5% over the past 24-hours.

Silvergate ( SI ) disclosed last week that its average quarter-to-date digital customer deposits slid to $9.8B (excluding FTX deposits) as of November 15 from $11.9B on September 30. Manan Gosalia, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimated that Silvergate's ( SI ) digital deposit balances for quarter-end will drop further to $5B from the previous estimate of $9B, adding that its sources of liquidity to fund deposit outflows are ""more expensive than SI's zero-cost digital deposits, and will weigh on earnings."" In turn, the sell-side analyst reduced his 2023 EPS estimate further to $1.58 from $4.48 , compared with the Street consensus of $4.08. Furthermore, the medium-term performance of SI stock will depend on the extremity of deposit outflows, Gosalia wrote in a note. As such, ""any indication that deposit balances have troughed and are rising again would be positive for the stock."" But ""evidence of additional stress on deposits, or further declines in the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), would be negative."" SI shares rose 3.5% to $29.12 in Friday morning trading, down 50% in the past month and -85% year-over-year.

The costs against Cøbra were awarded in a copyright case related to the the Bitcoin white paper, the cryptocurrency's founding manifesto. Wright, an Australian computer scientist, has long claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin. He accused Cøbra and bitcoin.org of infringing his rights after the website published the white paper, attributed to Satoshi. Wright sought a declaration that, as Satoshi, he owned the copyright.  Wright was granted permission to serve legal papers on Cøbra in April 2021. That June, after Cøbra failed to appear in court, a judge issued a default order to Cøbra to take down the white paper.  This is not Wright's first spin about a courtroom. He suffered a loss this October in Norway, where he was sued for claiming and failing to prove that he is Satoshi. The judge in the case ruled there was enough evidence that Wright had lied and cheated in his attempts to prove he was indeed the inventor of the cryptocurrency. Wright is appealing that ruling, his legal team said.  Read more: UK Court Orders Bitcoin.org to Remove White Paper Following Craig Wright Lawsuit  Unidentified defendants are typically not required to reveal themselves and their addresses in similar cases. This instance is different because the pseudonymous operator of bitcoin.org, through their representatives, challenged Wright's legal costs. To do so they must drop their anonymity, Costs Judge Jason Rowley said in a ruling dated Nov. 24, reviewed and verified by CoinDesk.  Rowley said the move to contest the costs ""is in contrast to the substantive proceedings where the defendant seemed to be rather sanguine about the effect of the injunction, namely the removal of the relevant document from the website.""  ""Consequently, I have come to the conclusion that if the defendant wishes to challenge the claimant’s bill of costs, then they will have to identify themselves in the manner indicated in the application notice,"" Rowley said in the order. ""Until that has occurred, the court cannot take notice of the points of dispute that have been served.""  Rowley also said that should Cøbra not wish to unmask themselves, they can request anonymization. That, however, will not prevent the claimant from learning their name.  ""I accept that that does not generally prevent the opponent from knowing who the party is, but that is the extent to which a party can be involved in proceedings and limit their identification,"" the ruling said.  Cøbra has 21 days from Thursday to appeal and another 14 to ""identify themselves if they are going to do so.""  ""In the absence of either an appeal or an identification, the claimant will be at liberty to seek a default costs certificate in five weeks’ time,"" the ruling said.  The document also revealed that, after the default judgment last June, ""the judge declined to carry out any summary assessment of the costs and ordered that they should go for detailed assessment."" Wright had then sought what a judge deemed a “staggering” interim payment and was instead awarded ""what appears to be a relatively low percentage"" of the costs claimed  The total sum ordered was 35,000 British pounds ($42,261) including tax.

Many of FTX’s activities reflect deeply flawed corporate governance - issues not inherently related to cryptocurrencies. Other problems are related to its cryptocurrency dealings. Liquidity problems have continued to plague market participants way beyond FTX into the Thanksgiving week, and the fallout is likely to continue. By Robert Eisenbeis, Ph.D. The collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) - the third-largest of such exchanges - on the heels of significant price declines in the value of many cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), for example, has lost 70% of its value from its high on November 10, 2021) highlights what many have known for some time: that cryptocurrencies and related entities are very risky, speculative activities that are largely unregulated. Some have called the industry the “Wild West,” and rightly so. At present, there are over 9,300 cryptocurrencies in existence, and they operate internationally in hyperspace, that implies over 40 million possible exchange rates if one wanted to convert from one currency to another. This is compared with 180 government-sponsored currencies in the world, requiring about 15,000 exchange rates. The crypto industry has expanded and is now quite complex. It includes issuers, exchanges, specialized hedge funds, banks, and securities firms, plus crypto-based investment vehicles such as ETFs. While some skeptics, Jamie Dimon among them, have voiced reservations about cryptocurrencies, at the same time their firms, including JPMorganChase ( JPM ), Morgan Stanley ( MS ), and Goldman Sachs ( GS ), have quietly entered various aspects of the cryptocurrency business. Even the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has created a 12-week pilot program based upon a digital dollar-based blockchain system involving participants like BNY Mellon ( BMY ), Citi ( C ), HSBC , Mastercard ( MA ), PNC Bank ( PNC ), TD Bank ( TD ), Truist ( TFC ), U.S. Bank ( USB ), and Wells Fargo ( WFC ). Whether the events surrounding FTX will chill this project remains to be seen. The collapse of FTX is one in a series of recent failures in the cryptocurrency industry, beginning with the collapse in May of the crypto firm Terra ( UST-USD ), which spilled over into significant price declines for both Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), two of the largest cryptocurrency entities. Terra’s collapse was followed by the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund, and the collapse of the Voyager exchange. The problems in FTX were triggered by an article in CoinDesk, the digital news site that follows the crypto industry, questioning the finances of FTX. The article resulted in a run on both FTX and its cryptocurrency FTT, as well as on other cryptocurrencies. The run that occurred in early November, and that continues to this day, exposed five separate potential problems contributing to FTX’s failure. First, FTX was an international conglomerate, headquartered most recently in the Bahamas but with more than 130 subsidiaries and affiliates headquartered in many countries. The bankruptcy filing in the US notes that FTX’s business were essentially conducted in four “silos” - a venture capital arm; a hedge fund that traded cryptocurrencies for profit; and two exchanges, one for operations in the US and one for operations internationally. Its business model was complex, lacked transparency, involved multiple corporate entities, had few if any internal controls, and was filled with self-dealing, as explained by the Wall Street Journal on November 19. Second, the firm’s value was based upon the value of its FTX exchange, which utilized a centralized custodian of the cryptocurrencies that traded on the exchange. Third, the firm had a venture capital and trading firm affiliate, Alameda Research, that made loans to many insiders of the firm based upon its holdings of FTT, the company’s crypto token. FTX provided loans and FTT tokens to Alameda to prop it up when Alameda began to experience financial problems. Third, the firm lacked effective regulatory oversight to protect the interests of investors and clients from the culpable self-dealing of FTX and Alameda, which seems to have surprised everyone was the reach of its subsidiaries around the world. Fourth, FTX operated as a centralized exchange that maintained its own electronic order book and held crypto assets and reserves on a centralized computer system which was subject to misuse. It is important to realize that cryptocurrencies are not physical assets but are instead simply electronic records stored in digital files. Like all cryptocurrencies, FTT had no intrinsic value other than what people would be willing to pay at any given moment. Value was based upon trust rather than substance. Fifth, a substantial portion of the firm’s assets were in the form of its own cryptocurrency, FTT. It was like listing your own personal IOUs as an asset on your balance sheet. Many of FTX’s activities are reminiscent of fraudulent practices at Enron that reflected deeply flawed corporate governance - issues not inherently related to cryptocurrencies. Other problems are related to its cryptocurrency dealings, where much of FTX’s market value was based upon its own liabilities that were reported as assets on its balance sheet. Those liabilities required the trust of market participants to maintain value and proved to be the source of significant liquidity problems when trust vanished. Indeed, for a variety of reasons, liquidity problems have continued to plague market participants way beyond FTX into the Thanksgiving week. The Bahamian securities regulator ordered the transfer of all digital assets of FTX Digital Markets Ltd., a Bahama subsidiary of FTX, to a digital wallet controlled by the regulator. It is reported that the regulator then converted all the FTT tokens to Ethereum. The amount was reportedly somewhere between $477 and $500 million, and this sale and subsequent sales have depressed prices of Ethereum and subsequently of Bitcoin when owners of Ethereum converted funds to Bitcoin. Losses have been experienced by many different parties, including Tiger Global, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and Sequoia Capital, totaling some $347 million. The FTX bankruptcy also resulted in a reported $3 billion in losses. The fallout is likely to continue. Whether the crypto industry survives the loss of confidence remains to be seen. What we know is that it isn’t over till it’s over.

But now we have a new problem - cryptocurrencies that are not widely traded. FTX using the value of the last trade overvalues their holdings of worthless crypto. It is actually more valuable for them not to trade than to swamp the market. That said, what will happen when they are forced to liquidate? What I am writing was sparked by what is happening with FTX ( FTT-USD ), which reminded me of promoted penny stocks. Now, before I go on to that, let me mention what the results were regarding the promoted penny stocks that I wrote articles about, the last one of which was written a little less than seven years ago. I only wrote about promoted penny stocks when I personally received a promotion, whether by snail mail or email. Of the 32 stocks I wrote about, how many failed in entire? Twenty-four. How many have a market cap over $1 million? Three. How many actually appreciated in price from the time I wrote the article? One, Barfresh ( BRFH ), which was the only one the I said seemed legitimate. Penny stocks are less of a problem today as a result of the efforts of Seeking Alpha and, to a far lesser extent, me. But now we have a new problem - cryptocurrencies that are not widely traded. FTX had several cryptocurrencies which they held on their balance sheet, where they held a huge amount of the cryptocurrency relative to the float, or trading volume. This included FTT and Serum, among others. If FTX sold those cryptocurrencies in size to raise US dollars, the price would quickly go to something near zero. The same is true of promoted penny stocks. If they did a large issuance of stock, the price would quickly go to something near zero. (Far better to do a rights offering.) Instead, they quietly deal stock in small amounts at a discount to the market price to pay for services, goods, etc. Promoted penny stocks are the only investment class where the statement of shareholder equity is the most important statement. As such, FTX using the value of the last trade overvalues their holdings of worthless crypto. It is actually more valuable for them not to trade than to swamp the market. That said, what will happen when they are forced to liquidate? (Think of Luna ( LUNA-USD ) and Terra ( UST-USD ).) You could structure the accounting for assets on the balance sheet at entrance value, current value, or exit value. Each has its implications - success, survival, and failure, respectively. Unless we decide to have multiple balance sheets and income statements, which I have suggested in the past but will never take place, a single balance sheet will never represent reality - survival is probably the best overall option, and that is close to what GAAP does, with its many imperfections. As such, please realize that most unaudited intermediaries of cryptocurrencies are likely insolvent. It is time to liquidate and go back to US dollars, prone as they are to inflation.

Aptos Labs, Jump Crypto and other prominent crypto companies joined the exchange’s initiative and will contribute $50 million to it. The increase comes a day after Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao announced the fund.  Crypto lending firm Matrixport is looking to raise $100 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. The Singapore-based firm led by Jihan Wu already has commitments for $50 million from lead investors at the sky-high valuation, but is still looking for investors for the rest.

Since time is of the essence, here is a quick rundown of TRX: Major new enhancements that will smooth out the protocol’s operation have been released The proposal from PancakeSwap has the potential to be a strong positive catalyst Current price action is negative, but a reversal would be bullish 📢Java-tron GreatVoyage-4.6.0(Socrates) has been released! 🛠It is a mandatory update, contains a few important features: ✅update the checkpoint mechanism of data storage ✅optimize the storage structure of resource delegation relationship — TRON DAO (@trondao) November 23, 2022 That’s not all good news, either. PancakeSwap just made an announcement to its user base that it would be accepting TRX into its Syrup staking pool. The price of TRX eventually reflects all of this. Using a weekly time frame, CoinGecko reports that TRX’s price rose 0.8%. Everything looks and sounds fantastic, but what do the experts have to say about it? To Uptrend, Or Not To Uptrend? It doesn’t look like it’ll form an uptrend on the charts, and that might be for a number of reasons. It’s worth noting that the Bollinger band is establishing a crunch zone immediately following the cup formation in TRX. Related Reading: Polkadot Soars 8% In Last 24 Hours Courtesy Of Its Dev’t Activity, NFT Ecosystem Growth Chart: TradingView The impending decline may be part of a larger cup-and-handle structure with an ascending triangle serving as its handle. The regression model also reveals that the present decline is robust, with Pearson’s R value hitting 0.61, indicating that despite positive events on-chain, pain is not out of the question for TRX. The fact that the RSI is still in the oversold bottom half further confirms a downward trend. All of this is occurring as TRX trades at $0.0525 per coin. On a 4-hour timeframe, the technical indicators are optimistic, as the RSI is rising and the bollinger band is widening. As this indicator oscillates between overbought and oversold, the rising RSI value is accompanied by a decline in price. According to CoinGlass, the TRX derivatives market is improving slightly as exchange financing rates improve. TVL decreased on the DeFi side of Tron from $4.31 billion to $4.29 billion. Chart: Coinglass Not Enough Momentum TRX investors and traders are unquestionably instilled with confidence by recent events. According to CoinGlass, this is further underlines by the fact that more traders are entering long holdings than short positions. However, based on the metrics, they should proceed with caution, as the technicals indicate that TRX will experience further losses. However, short-term traders could target the $0.056 barrier, as this would be a good place to begin a rally.

The Dogecoin price, possibly triggered by Gokhshtein’s speculation, saw a massive spike of more than 12% at one point in the aftermath. The price shot up from $0.0823 to as high as $0.0913 on Binance. At press time, however, DOGE was already experiencing a slight correction of the swing and was trading at $0.0882. “I feel that we’ll all seen Vitalik and Elon working together to somehow upgrade DOGE”, Gokhshtein tweeted and added that “they won’t work on Bitcoin — well because Vitalik tried that in the past and was kicked and Elon is interested in turning something that started off as a joke into something serious.” However, it is important to remark that neither Musk nor Buterin have commented on Gokhshtein tweet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Rejection, Why BTC Could Resume Its Downtrend The crypto-influencer is making a pure speculation, presumably based on previous statements made by both individuals. Musk is known to be one of the biggest, if not the biggest Dogecoin (DOGE) supporter. His tweets have caused massive swings in the DOGE price in the past. Last but not least, there are rumors and hints – which Musk has never fully dispelled – that Musk himself is the biggest holder of Dogecoin (DOGE). Deep Dogecoin Ties Between Buterin And Musk Vitalik Buterin, for his part, has already spoken out several times on the subject of a DOGE upgrade from proof of work to proof of stake. According to Buterin, Dogecoin has been in consideration for a move to proof-of-stake for some time. Buterin shared this assessment at Mainnet 2022, a crypto conference held Sept. 21-23 in New York. Back in August 2021, the Dogecoin Foundation announced its re-launch. First established in 2014, the foundation has since been able to count on the support of the Ethereum mastermind. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Must Maintain $77 Level To Sustain Enthusiasm Come December Buterin joined the board of the newly established Dogecoin Foundation as one of its four-member advisory team. A representative of Elon Musk is also on board. This is not necessarily surprising given the Tesla CEO’s previous activities regarding Dogecoin. Not least, Musk had called for a drastic reduction in transaction fees on the Dogecoin network, among other things. Moreover, Buterin has donated large amounts of DOGE to the Dogecoin Foundation several times in the past, the last time in November 2021. A year ago, he donated 20 million DOGE.

While Bitcoin was once touted as a hedge against equity markets and a potentially uncorrelated addition to investment portfolios, its growing correlation with the S&P 500 indicates otherwise. To better understand crypto’s relationship with other asset classes and the larger market, we investigated how various digital currencies correlate with active and passive funds, SPDR sector ETFs, and commodities. The crypto market’s recent gyrations following the FTX exchange’s bankruptcy necessitate a fresh look at the evolving relationships between cryptocurrencies and traditional asset classes. Current market dynamics notwithstanding, interest in digital assets remains high: 16% of Americans have either invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrencies, while around 87% say they know at least a little about them, according to Pew Research Center data from July . While Bitcoin was once touted as a hedge against equity markets and a potentially uncorrelated addition to investment portfolios, its growing correlation with the S&P 500 indicates otherwise. Correlation’s role in portfolio diversification is well-known: Less correlation reduces risk and overall portfolio volatility. From 2019 to 2022, however, the S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index (SPCBDM)’s correlation to the S&P 500 rose from 0.54 to 0.801, indicating that cryptocurrencies have moved increasingly in tandem with equities. To better understand crypto’s relationship with other asset classes and the larger market, we investigated how various digital currencies correlate with active and passive funds, SPDR sector ETFs, and commodities. If they’re uncorrelated or negatively correlated, then crypto could potentially contribute to lower overall portfolio risk through diversification. If not, a crypto allocation may be counterproductive. To conduct our analysis, we gathered daily close price data for five cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ether ( ETH-USD ), Litecoin ( LTC-USD ), Ripple ( XRP-USD ), and Cardano ( ADA-USD ) - from October 2019 to October 2022. We collected the same data subsets for a selection of mutual funds, including large-cap growth, large-cap value, and mid-cap growth, among other varieties, as well as for various active and passive equity and bond funds, with each category consisting of a total of 30 funds. We also culled daily close price data for the following eight SPDR sector ETFs during the same period: XLB (US materials), XLE (US energy), XLF (US financials), XLI (US industrials), XLK (US technology), XLP (US consumer staples), XLU (US utilities), and XLV (US health care). Finally, we compiled the same data for gold, silver, crude oil, natural gas, and the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM). We then calculated daily returns based on these prices using Python. From there, we created correlation matrices and heat maps to assess the relationships among the cryptocurrencies and the various funds, sectors, and commodities. Crypto And Sector ETFs: Correlation Heat Map (Refinitiv data) Crypto Coefficients Of the five cryptocurrencies, Litecoin had the highest correlation with both Bitcoin and Ether at 0.81, while Bitcoin and Ether had a significant positive relationship, with a correlation of 0.79. Comparatively, Cardano and XRP had lower correlations, from 0.46 to 0.58, with their crypto peers. The five cryptocurrencies have negligible or weak positive correlations with the sector ETFs, according to our results. These correlations range from 0.1 to a maximum of 0.39, with XRP exhibiting the lowest. Among ETFs, XLK (US technology) and XLB (US materials) demonstrated the highest - if only weakly positive - correlation with the cryptocurrencies. The correlations within the sector ETFs were much greater, topping out at 0.92 for XLI (US industrials) and XLF (US financials), and XLI and XLB. So what about the correlation between crypto and the various mutual funds? The following heat map illustrates the low positive correlation among them. The correlations range from a bottom of 0.19 to a high of 0.41. These suggest a relatively weak but slightly stronger relationship than that between the digital currencies and the sector ETFs. As with the sector ETFs, of all the cryptocurrencies, XRP displays the lowest mutual fund correlation. Crypto And Mutual Funds: Correlation Heat Map (Refinitiv data) Growth funds exhibit a stronger correlation to cryptocurrencies than value funds. The correlation coefficient between small-cap growth funds and Bitcoin, for instance, is 0.41, compared to 0.35 for small-cap value funds and Bitcoin. This relationship is similar for both mid-cap and large-cap funds, and implies that crypto assets are weakly sensitive to the interest rate dynamics that have driven much of the recent drawdown in growth stocks. The correlation with mutual funds was much higher, however, with that between mid-cap value and small-cap value funds topping out at 0.97. The cryptocurrencies display even weaker positive correlations with bonds than they do with equities, according to the following heat map. Demonstrating Sharpe’s arithmetic , the correlation to active and passive equity funds is by far the highest at 0.98. Crypto, Passive And Active Equity And Bonds: Correlation Heat Map (Refinitiv) As for commodities 1 , the heat map below demonstrates that all the cryptocurrencies have negligible positive or negative correlations with them. Only natural gas shows low negative relationships with crypto, specifically BTC, LTC, ADA, and XRP. Since the values are close to zero, these assets have little to no co-movement. Silver has the highest correlation, peaking at 0.26 for silver and Bitcoin. Bitcoin, the so-called “digital gold,” exhibits only weak correlation with the precious metal. Crypto And Commodities: Correlation Heat Map (Gold, silver, and BCOM data from Refinitiv; natural gas and crude oil data from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and US Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)) So, what can we take away from all this? Cryptocurrencies’ low positive correlation with mutual funds and ETFs may indicate an increase in cross-market trading and signal crypto’s growing popularity. Moreover, in a rising interest rate environment and amid the diminished efficacy of the traditional 60/40 equity/bond portfolio, crypto’s weak correlation to traditional assets may offer potential diversification benefits for long-horizon investors who can withstand added short-term volatility. Not all cryptocurrencies display the same lack of correlation to traditional assets, however, so investors need to be discerning about which ones they target. __________ 1 People commonly invest in commodities through forward contracts or futures contracts. Since these contracts are derivatives, they derive their values from their underlying assets. A futures contract on gold, for instance, derives its value from the spot prices of gold. According to the cost of carry model, the futures price is influenced by the spot price of the underlying asset. The futures price is determined as the sum of the asset’s spot price plus the cost of carrying/storage. Using spot prices allows for better representation of the underlying value of the asset.

42413593,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9w0S,1669377211,Matrixport Favors 'Systematic Bitcoin Call Overwriting' Strategy for 2023,"One of the best ways to participate in the crypto market next year is by consistently offering insurance against a bitcoin (BTC) price rally, according to crypto services provider Matrixport.  The strategy, known as systematic call option overwriting, often outperforms a buy-and-hold approach in a market without a strong bullish direction, and Matrixport said it doesn't foresee a raging bitcoin bull market in 2023.  ""'The 'weekly systematic call overwriting strategy' could be a winner as the industry likely moves through several months of uncertainty,"" Markus Thielen, Matrixport's head of research at strategy, said in a note to clients on Friday.  Overwriting involves regularly selling weekly expiry call options while owning the underlying asset. In effect it means offering insurance against price increases to the counterparty, because they have the right – but not the obligation – to buy the asset at the predetermined price on or before the expiry date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market and compensates the seller for offering insurance by paying a premium.  For the seller, the premium adds extra percentage points of income to their annual return. The extra income is limited to the size of the premium.  An example of call overwriting is when an investor owns one bitcoin and sells a call option on it at a strike price that's higher than the current market price. For example, giving the option buyer the right to purchase the bitcoin at, say $20,000, when the current price is $16,400. If the price tops $20,000 before the option expires, the option buyer has an opportunity to make a profit.  The strategy, however, exposes the overwriter to the risk of missing out on a large increase in bitcoin's price. As a call seller, they are obligated to sell the underlying asset if the option buyer wants to exercise their purchase right, which is likely when the market price moves above the strike level.  ""The biggest risk for this strategy is a raging bull market with high volatility due to excessive leverage returns, as we have seen in early-to-mid 2021,"" Thielen said, downplaying the prospect of a renewed upside volatility explosion in 2023.  ""Since the summer of 2021, exchanges have cut down on leverage, and offering customers excessive leverage seems unlikely in a post-FTX crypto world when the regulator will likely take a close look at retail’s ability to access leverage,"" Thielen noted.  The demand for and prices of options are closely tied to the degree of uncertainty in the market, realized – or historical – volatility and expectations for price turbulence, also known as implied volatility. And volatility is mean-reverting, so seasoned traders sell options (call, put or both) when volatility is elevated and buy options when volatility is cheap.  According to Thielen, the recent implosion of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and resulting contagion fears have lifted implied volatility, making call options pricier. Therefore, now is a good time to overwrite calls.  ""The recent stress in the crypto world has lifted volatility above the five-year moving average. The rise in volatility has increased the value of calls. Hence this strategy has become even more attractive now as the strategy can sell calls for a higher premium,"" Thielen said.  According to Matrixport's back-testing models, the systematic call overwriting strategy would have generated double-digit annualized returns in the past two years. That's impressive considering bitcoin recently fell to a two-year low under $16,000, completing a round-trip.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/25/matrixport-favors-systematic-bitcoin-call-overwriting-strategy-for-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c49f2b185c5b423ef78d040bd2680b89103ae8d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Over the last 30 days, Ether has recorded a drop of around 20%. At press time, the price was at $1,171, just above the crucial support level of $1,100. In the short term, the ETH price has found support at $1,171. However, if the key resistance at $1,230 is not breached in the next few days, a retest of the level at $1,100 could be on the cards. An important on-chain indicator for Bitcoin indicates that this does not have to be the case. Since the crypto market is heavily dependent on Bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, a bottoming of BTC, could also mean accelerated gains for altcoins, led by Ethereum. As cryptocurrency exchange ByBit notes in its analysis of the market today, the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value Ratio) of short-term Bitcoin holders has exceeded that of long-term holders (HODLers) for the first time this cycle. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Recovery Could Soon Fade If ETH Fails To Surpass $1,250 The MVRV shows periods of market euphoria when the market value was significantly higher than the realized value, meaning the cost basis for Bitcoin purchases. “This could suggest a possible bottom formation, especially when direction traders are doing better than HODLers with strong convictions,” the analysis states. Ethereum: EIP-4844 Implementation in March? Meanwhile, Ethereum investors can look forward to highly positive news. As Tim Beiko summarized, Ethereum developers are working towards including EIP-4844 (also known as proto-danksharding). This is a highly anticipated scaling proposal, in a future mainnet upgrade. Whether EIP-4844 will be rolled out with Shanghai in March is currently pending. However, a decision could be made on December 08. This is when the next ACD, the last one in 2022 will be held. Beiko stated that” it’d be great to wrap up the year with the final specs for Shanghai”. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Rejection, Why BTC Could Resume Its Downtrend So far, EIP-3651 (Warm COINBASE), EIP-3855 (PUSH0 statement), EIP-3860 (Limit and counter init code) and EIP-4895 (Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations) are guaranteed for the Shanghai hard fork of Ethereum. EIP-4844 is intended to introduce a new transaction format called shard-blob transaction. This allows data to be stored off-chain and accessed temporarily by Ethereum nodes. Liam Horne, CEO of OP Labs, the developer of Optimism that uses roll-ups, expressed that L2 fees could become much cheaper. “This is a GAME CHANGER for the rollup-centric roadmap, as fees could be lowered ~100x,” Horne said. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin commented on EIP-4844 as following: This is a crucial first step to massively lower fees on L2, helping to make it affordable for much larger numbers of users to directly use on-chain applications instead of relying on cefi intermediaries. Yesterday, the broadest commitment across all developer teams was that EIP-4895 should happen quickly, ideally around March. “There are other things they [the Ethereum client teams] are working on in parallel, and if these can make it at the same time, we should include them, but withdrawals guide the fork,” Beiko summarized.

4759441,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510067,1669374565,Litecoin (LTC) Must Maintain $77 Level To Sustain Enthusiasm Come December,"Litecoin (LTC) is currently experiencing a sharp price correction, going down by more than 4% during the last hour, according to latest tracking from Coingecko. At the time of this writing, the crypto asset is trading at $75.94 after hovering around the $78 region for most of the day. With its recent price dump, the altcoin trimmed its seven-day gains to 20% from a high of 33% this week. Still, LTC’s current performance is impressive as it managed to go up by 33.5% over the last 30 days. Litecoin caught the attention of many crypto enthusiasts on November 23 when it went on a bullish run that enabled it to reach the $81 marker and increase its market capitalization by more than $1 billion. Currently, in that category, LTC ranks 13th in Coingecko’s list, keeping an overall valuation of $5.39 billion. Related Reading: Polkadot Soars 8% In Last 24 Hours Courtesy Of Its Dev’t Activity, NFT Ecosystem Growth What It Would Take For LTC To Hit Higher Levels Next Month By besting the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of weekly gains, Litecoin put itself in the position to be among the crypto assets that experts are keeping an eye on. In fact, crypto trading expert Rekt Capital shared his thoughts about the conditions that must be met by LTC in order to sustain its energy and perform better come December. “LTC upside wicks have gone up to as high to the $85-$98 region before ultimately rejecting there. Price needs to Monthly close & hold above $67 to move higher next month,” said the pseudonymous crypto figure. Rekt Capital also pointed out that given Litecoin’s history of being rejected from the greater demand region, it needs to keep the $67 price territory when November ends for its uptrend to be confirmed and for it to test higher price levels. Analyst Bullish About Momentum For Litecoin Meanwhile, well-known crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa also shared its take on what awaits Litecoin following its impressive run despite the bearish market that now engulfs the crypto space. It noted that after LTC successfully flipped its 200-day Exponential Moving Average, there is no doubt that the next stop for the crypto asset is the $100 territory. That though, could only happen if the digital asset is able to continue its upward trend. Cryptocurrency data provider Coincodex, however, might have to disagree with this bullish sentiment for the altcoin as its forecasts are not looking good for Litecoin right now. According to its prediction, in five days, LTC will trade at $74.60 and one month from now, the asset will change hands at $62.04. Although Litecoin might have the chance to close November with a higher trading price than the $67 crucial marker, it would appear the asset is in for another downhill drive as the tail-end of 2022 nears.

SOL’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as most traders and investors remain cautious. SOL’s price bounces from a low of $11 on the daily timeframe as the price looks weak, trading below 50 and 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Solana (SOL) has had a rough start this month, with the price action not looking nice after suffering a drastic price decline from a region of $35 to $11 due to the FTX fiasco, which has had a more direct impact on the price. Despite the relief bounce from Solana (SOL), the price still trades below the key region of interest that would attract the attention of many buyers. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors has left the market at a standstill as the market is yet to make a major move leading to much fear about where the market could be headed. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Why The Bulls Could Aim Fresh Rally To $0.45 Solana (SOL) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart Despite the uncertainty and turbulence that has affected the price of Solana (SOL) and the crypto market at large, many altcoins are struggling for survival, trying to stay afloat as the prices of altcoins continue a downward price movement. Solana (SOL) has suffered more price loss, and the community has been affected and, as such, needs more rebuilding in terms of price and trust for the project after the damage caused by FTX. SOL’s price declined from a region of $35 to a region of $11 as SOL lost its key support of $20. The price of SOL failed to hold above $20, leading to price retesting lower price points. The price of SOL continues to hold above $11, indicating a good sign for the price of SOL on the weekly chart and other timeframes. If the price of SOL loses this region of interest, this will lead to lower prices, and panic could set in. Weekly resistance for the price of SOL – $20. Weekly support for the price of SOL – $10. Price Analysis Of SOL On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of SOL remains considerably weak in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $14 after SOL saw its price decline from $35 to $11 as the market continues in its state of uncertainty. SOL’s price continues to struggle as price aims for more relief bounce from this region. The price of SOL needs to reclaim and trade above $20 for a short-term relief bounce. The $20, corresponding to the Fibonacci retracement value of 38.2%, will strongly resist the SOL price. If the price of SOL flips the region of $20, we could see more rallies for SOL to a region of $30 or more. Daily resistance for the SOL price – $20. Daily support for the SOL price – $11.

CEO Changpeng Zhao had tweeted on Nov. 25 that the funding was for the firm's industry recovery initiative.  Crypto exchange Binance allocated another $1 billion to its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) just days after topping it up to $1 billion after its value fell as the crypto market declined. The emergency insurance pot was established in 2018 to protect users' funds.  The expansion was affirmed in an email to CoinDesk after Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao on Friday tweeted the money had been allocated to the exchange's industry recovery initiative, which aims to consider investment opportunities resulting from the collapse of firms such as Three Arrows Capital, Celsius and FTX.  Binance also said Aptos Labs and Jump Crypto, along with other prominent crypto companies joined the industry initiative and will contribute $50 million to the fund.  The recovery fund would be used to buy distressed crypto assets and support the industry. The crypto market has seen a massive decline since the start of the year, leading to several crypto firms going out of business.  The crypto market continues to be under pressure, with bitcoin (BTC) trading 1.6% lower during the day, hovering at around $16,400 at the time of writing.

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.374 on the 4-hours chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a strong increase if it clears the $0.400 resistance zone. Ripple Price Eyes Fresh Increase After a strong decline, ripple’s XRP formed a base above the $0.320 zone against the US Dollar. The price started a decent increase above the $0.335 and $0.340 resistance levels.

ETH could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $1,250 resistance. Ethereum struggled to gain pace for a move above the $1,230 resistance level. The price is now trading above $1,170 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term bullish flag forming with resistance near $1,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if there is no clear move above $1,230 and $1,250. Ethereum Price Faces Rejection Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $1,150 resistance, similar to bitcoin. ETH even climbed above the $1,200 resistance and settled above the 100 hourly simple moving average. However, there was no test of the $1,230 resistance zone. Ether price traded as high as $1,215 and is currently correcting gains. There was a minor decline below the $1,200 level. It is now approaching the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,073 swing low to $1,215 high. It is now trading above $1,170 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a short-term bullish flag forming with resistance near $1,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,200 level and the channel trend line. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $1,230 level. The key breakout zone sits near the $1,250 level. To move into a positive zone, the price must settle above $1,250. In the stated case, ether price may perhaps rise towards the $1,320 resistance zone. Any more gains might open the doors for a test of the $1,400 resistance zone. Fresh Decline in ETH? If ethereum fails to climb above the $1,230 resistance, it could start another decline. An initial support on the downside is near the $1,170 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The next major support is near the $1,150 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,073 swing low to $1,215 high, below which ether price may perhaps gain bearish momentum. In the stated scenario, the price could decline towards the $1,070 support zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.

42413585,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9vsy,1669342388,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Stays Calm at $16.5K,"Good morning. This is an abbreviated version of First Mover Asia because the team is out of the office today for a CoinDesk company holiday in the U.S. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin holds its $16,500 perch as the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend begins.  Insights: Jocelyn Yang writes about the domino effect caused by the the downfall of FTX.  Prices  Bitcoin Trades Sideways, Holds Over $16.5K  By James Rubin  Bitcoin's price barely budged on the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,500, down a mere 0.11% over the past 24 hours. BTC has been holding steady around $16,000 for the past three weeks, although it took a brief dip below $15,500 on Monday amid fears about the future of crypto trading and lending firm Genesis Global Capital, which has been caught up in crypto platform FTX's implosion.  Crypto markets calmed over the past three days, however, buoyed along with equity indexes by signs that the U.S. central bank would retreat from its current diet of hawkish 75 basis point interest rate hikes. While a number of crypto observers say the recent debacles may ultimately strengthen the crypto industry by forcing regulators to ratchet up their efforts, most analysts remain bearish about prices.  Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands at about $1,195, up 1.16% over the past day. Other cryptos were mixed, with Cardano's ADA down almost a percentage point (-0.96%) and Quant (QNT) trading up 0.32%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was down 0.26%.  Insights  FTX Contagion Revives Dreaded 2022 Crypto Knell – the ‘Withdrawal Halt’  By Jocelyn Yang  In the crypto industry in 2022, the phrase ""halting withdrawals"" is like black smoke billowing out of a building. Damage is certain.  Technically, it means that a crypto exchange or lender has gated customers from being able to get their money or digital tokens back – typically because there just aren't enough assets on hand to meet redemption requests. The likely upshot, though, is that the business is unlikely to recover easily from the destruction. In many cases, a bankruptcy filing is the next step.  Now, the rapid unraveling of once-billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, including the FTX exchange and the crypto trading firm Alameda Research, has unleashed a fresh wave of crypto exchanges and lenders halting customers’ withdrawals over the past few weeks.  The collateral damage lengthens a list of casualties from the dramatic collapse of the Terra blockchain earlier this year, which accelerated or led directly to the failures of crypto firms including Celsius Network, Babel Finance, Voyager Digital and Three Arrows Capital.  (CoinDesk counts 16 distinct withdrawal-halt announcements this year; the list is below.)  The contagion can spread swiftly. When one company suddenly refuses redemption requests, another company suddenly faces a liquidity crisis. Market jitters unnerve investors, leading to further withdrawal requests, exacerbating the panic. Such is the pattern in digital-asset markets where there is no Federal Reserve or other central bank backstopping it all – as there is in the traditional financial system.  “For each player, you're going to be in this situation where all of a sudden you have to manage how much information you want to reveal,” said Benoit Bosc, global head of product at crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR. “It might be more information than you actually want to reveal then.”  BlockFi, Genesis  BlockFi, a crypto lender, paused client withdrawals from its platform on Nov. 10, citing the “lack of clarity” around FTX's current situation; this move came two days after the FTX exchange fully halted customer withdrawals on Nov. 8. BlockFi later acknowledged its “significant exposure” to FTX.  Last week, Genesis, a big crypto financial firm, announced its lending unit had suspended redemptions and new loan originations, citing “the extreme market dislocation and loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion.” Earlier in the year, the business suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses after Three Arrows Capital’s failure. (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)  Bosc cited Warren Buffett’s oft-repeated quote: “‘When the tide goes out, you see who is swimming naked.’”  Nicholas Colas, co-founder of the market analysis firm DataTrek Research, wrote in a note that the current crisis will take time to be resolved, and “until then this space will likely see more selling pressure.”  The following is a timeline of crypto firms’ withdrawal suspensions in the past few weeks:  Nov. 8: The FTX exchange halted customer withdrawals, an FTX support employee said in the company's official Telegram group.  Nov. 10: Crypto lender BlockFi halted withdrawals from its platform, citing the “lack of clarity” around FTX's current situation at that time. (In a Nov. 14 update, the lender acknowledged its “significant exposure” to FTX.)  Nov. 11: FTX US ceased processing crypto withdrawals. The same day, FTX Group companies – including FTX Trading and FTX US – filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S.  Nov. 13: The Hong Kong-based crypto exchange AAX said it had suspended withdrawals for as long as 10 days due to ​​the failure of an unidentified third party. The company said it had no financial exposure to FTX or its affiliates. On Nov. 23, AAX announced it would close out derivatives positions.  Nov. 15: The Japanese crypto exchange Liquid, owned by FTX, suspended both fiat and crypto withdrawals on its Liquid Global platform “in compliance with the requirements of voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States.” The exchange announced on Nov. 20 that it had paused all forms of trading on its platform.  Nov. 15: Crypto lending platform SALT said it had halted all deposits and withdrawals on its platform due to FTX exposure.  Nov. 16: Crypto investment bank Genesis Global Trading’s lending unit temporarily suspended redemptions and new loan originations, citing “the extreme market dislocation and loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion.”  Nov. 16: The Winklevoss brothers’ Gemini exchange said it was pausing withdrawals on its yield-earning Earn program as the exchange suffered a $485 million rush of outflows following Genesis' announcement earlier in the day. Genesis Global Trading powered the Earn program for Gemini.  And here is a timeline of withdrawal suspensions from earlier this year:  June 12: Celsius Network says that it is “pausing all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts.” (Celsius filed for bankruptcy on July 13.)  June 17: Babel says “redemptions and withdrawals from Babel Finance products will be temporarily suspended.”  June 23: CoinFLEX announces it is “pausing all withdrawals.”  July 1: Voyager Digital says it is “temporarily suspending trading, deposits, withdrawals and loyalty rewards.” (Voyager filed for bankruptcy protection on July 5.)  July 4: Vauld says that it “made the difficult decision to suspend all withdrawals, trading and deposits.”  July 20: Zipmex says that it is “pausing withdrawals until further notice.”  August 2: ZB.com announces that ""deposit and withdrawal services are now suspended"" after losing nearly five million in a suspected hack.  August 8: Hodlnaut says it ""will be halting withdrawals, token swaps and deposits with immediate effect.""
