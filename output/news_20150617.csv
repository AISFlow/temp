42398441,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTV8k,1434563461,Fantasy Bitcoin Stock Market Sand Hill Fined $20K By SEC,"UPDATE (17th June 20:00 BST): This report has been updated with a response to the SEC settlement from Sand Hill creator Gerrit Hall.      The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has settled with Sand Hill Exchange, an experimental stock market that used bitcoin.  Sand Hill  , a Boost VC graduate that began operating late last year, agreed to pay a $20,000 settlement for alleged violations of US securities law, according to an SEC release.  The founders of the site, the statement claims, did not admit to or deny the allegations but agreed to the SEC's cease-and-desist order.  Sand Hill had pitched itself as an experiment, allowing investors to purchase synthetic shares in unlisted Silicon Valley companies, akin to a fantasy sports version of the stock market.  The agency said in its settlement announcement:  ""An SEC investigation found that Silicon Valley-based Sand Hill Exchange was offering and selling security-based swaps contracts to retail investors outside the regulatory framework of a national securities exchange and without the required registration statements in effect.""  News that the site was under investigation surfaced earlier this month, when Sand Hill published a now-redacted blog post that outlined how the site had faced inquiries from the federal agency in April.  According to its main page, all money deposited by users has since been refunded.  SEC official Reid Muoio said in a statement that ""we were able to act quickly before any losses materialized in this offering that occurred outside the proper regulatory framework.""  Sand Hill responds  In a video statement posted to the company's blog, Sand Hill creator Gerrit Hall responded to the SEC settlement, remarking that ""I personally accept all responsibility for any and all wrongdoing throughout the entirety of Sand Hill Exchange.""  He explained that the SEC's involvement was sparked by a decision in March to allow users to pay using bitcoin during a private beta.  Hall explained:  ""I believed the 2006 UIGEA provided a carve-out for skill-based competitions with parimutuel outcomes. The SEC found otherwise, determining this constitutes a securities-based swap. We have complied with their cease-and-desist order, terminated our beta and refunded our friends.""  Hall added that he intends to continue operating Sand Hill ""without any real currency"", and called for the creation of flexible financial innovation frameworks, or ""sandboxes"", echoing statements from others in the digital currency space.

42398438,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTV6m,1434542760,EBA: 51% Attack Remains Bitcoin’s Biggest Problem,"Bitcoin’s biggest problem is still the threat of a 51% attack, according to Dr Dirk Haubrich, head of consumer protection and financial innovation at the European Banking Authority (EBA).  He said his main concern about the widespread adoption of bitcoin is the risk of a 51% attack, where a single entity contributes the majority of the network’s mining hashrate and, thus, gains full control of the network and can manipulate the blockchain.  Haubrich made these comments on Friday at an event titled Controlling Cryptocurrencies at the University of Birmingham in the UK.  He said he had spoken to numerous members of the virtual currency world two years ago and at the time, he was assured majority power would never occur. After it did, people assured him it didn’t matter, as the 51% would not abuse the system.  “As a financial regulator, I don't believe it. I've seen so much stuff happen from the financial institutions that created the financial crisis – and that is partly what brought about virtual currencies in the first place – so I don't believe in those promises any more,” Haubrich said.  Ensuring integrity  Haubrich feels the EBA could probably find a way to split up mining pools to prevent a 51% attack, but he is reluctant to go down this route. He said it goes against the philosophical origins of virtual currencies and the concept of a system without centralised control.  However, he added:  “We want to make sure there is integrity in a virtual currency system. So we want someone to be responsible for the integrity of the scheme.”  Haubrich said he doesn’t think a public authority or a regulator should take this responsibility. Two years ago, Haubrich would have suggested the Bitcoin Foundation for this role, but it’s not suitable now, given its “declining trajectory”, he said.  The EBA’s approach  The EBA produced a guidance document in July 2014, which outlined the risks and potential benefits of digital currencies such as bitcoin.  Haubrich explained the EBA’s process on deciding whether to regulate new technology or other developments in the payments space: “We assess the benefits, we define the risks and there is then the question to ask – do we need to get involved? Is there some sort of regulatory framework required?”  He admitted that, at first, the EBA thought it might be able to “shoehorn” cryptocurrencies into some of the existing directives, such as the Payment Service Directive.  “That way we [would] have an easy fix, but then we realised that a more comprehensive and separate regulatory regime is required. We as an authority won't want to deal with that ourselves, if the task had been a bit smaller we could have managed it, but it's too much,” Haubrich explained.  Instead, the authority issued an opinion, designed to offer guidance to other European Union institutions so they can decide what regulation, if any, to create. Haubrich said:  “This is going to take a while, given the length of time it takes European Commission houses of parliament to actually develop something – it could take several years for this to get off the ground, if it ever gets off the ground.”  Whatever happens, the EBA is keen for a regulatory environment that provides suitable consumer protections while also making sure innovation can flourish.  Economic sanctions  Haubrich outlined that, when the EBA was assessing the risks presented by cryptocurrencies, there were many it would be capable of addressing, but others went beyond the authority's remit.  Some risks, for example, fall within the political domain, such as the fact cryptocurrencies can undermine financial sanctions.  “The way financial sanctions are imposed is to tell the financial intermediary – a bank or payment services provider – they can no longer accept money from this person, or from this jurisdiction to that jurisdiction,” explained Haubrich.  He went on to say the peer-to-peer nature of cryptocurrency transactions means financial sanctions cannot be readily enforced. Whether these sanctions are right or wrong is not for him to decide, he said, so it’s up to separate authorities to consider whether they value this political tool more than the potential benefits cryptocurrencies present.  “We, as a financial regulator, are not elected by the populous. I am elected and I work to a mandate, not what I think should be the objective of society,” he concluded.

42426393,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9Th,1434530706,BTC.sx Rebrands as Magnr in Bitcoin Savings Account Launch,"Magnr, formerly BTC.sx – a bitcoin derivatives trading platform – has rebranded and is now offering bitcoin saving accounts with an interest rate fixed at 2.18% for a promotional period of six months.  Following this, the interest rate will be variable, dependent on trading fees generated by users on the platform. Magnr declined to reveal its trading volume but said that it had surpassed 60,000 total trades earlier this year.  When asked about the potential implications of bitcoin's price volatility on users' interest rates, Josh Blatchford, chief marketing officer at Magnr, emphasized that those saving bitcoin would likely always benefit users through positive returns.  Blatchford told CoinDesk:  ""Even if the price of bitcoin falls, users are still in a better position than just keeping their funds in a wallet. Although they would most likely lose money on exchange rates, by earning extra bitcoins as the price falls, they will have limited their loses.""  Additionally, Blatchford said users' interest rates will be calculated using blockchain data.  ""We identify how much bitcoin is in their wallet, calculate how long they have been saving from the time-stamps and then apply our interest rate,"" adding, ""this allows anyone to independently verify that their deposit is safe and that their interest payments are correct.""  Bitcoin saving  Magnr  is not the first to entice consumers with bitcoin saving accounts. Delta, a Hong-Kong web service and Canada-based Delta Financial, announced the launch of traditional interest bearing bitcoin deposit accounts last summer.  At the time, the firm offered a 5% minimum effective interest rate, though it has since discontinued such services.
