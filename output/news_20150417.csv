42378162,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MLDh,1429309450,Rainforest Foundation to Support New Digital Currency in Environmental Protection Bid,"The Rainforest Foundation has announced that it will utilize a new digital currency to help support its global forest protection efforts.  Called BitSeeds, the digital currency will be used to help fund the Rainforest Foundation as it supports the global cause. The organization was founded in 1989 by singer-songwriter Sting and his wife with the goal of preserving natural habitats in the Amazon River region.  BitSeeds will use a mixture of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake, with 100 million coins premined and set aside in a multisignature wallet that will generate quarterly interest. A non-profit organization called the BitSeeds Foundation, which is currently being registered in the state of Nevada, will hold custody of the funds, with the Rainforest Foundation acting as one of the keyholders for that wallet.  New York-based bitcoin payments processor Coin.co is also lending support to the initiative handling BitSeeds transactions, as part of the project will involve seeking out merchants who will adopt the currency.  Rainforest Foundation executive director Suzanne Pelletier told CoinDesk in an interview that work on the project started nearly a year ago after the group was approached by developer Gabriel Aronovich, who is spearheading the project.  Pelletier explained:  “It’s been a journey the past year trying to sort through how that could actually work, and so the idea was to develop a currency that was sustainable and that could help in the protection and planting of trees.”  The goal, she continued, is to plant 1 billion seeds over the lifetime of the coin’s production cycle, corresponding to the 1bn BitSeeds that will be mined or minted.  Funding fix  Though it has decided to pursue a more novel route than accepting bitcoin directly, according to Pelletier, the project aims to use digital currency to solve a familiar problem – funding.  She said that the Rainforest Foundation has developed a workable model for supporting the protection of rainforests, but that a sustainable solution to funding those efforts has been lacking.  Pelletier explained that her organization was open to new, disruptive ways of tapping support and that the BitSeeds concept fit in perfectly with that kind of vision.  “It’s a huge, enormous problem that’s going to take a lot of money to solve, and so we’re looking forward to a new, innovative way to fund that work,” she said.  The organization will also be accepting donations in BitSeed to promote the digital currency's use.

42378149,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MKyb,1429298555,Controversial Dark Web Bitcoin Bot Released from Custody,"An automated shopping bot designed to make purchases on dark web marketplaces using bitcoin has been released after it was confiscated months ago.  The Random Darknet Shopper made headlines last fall after it purchased, among other items, a supply of ecstasy pills from the dark web marketplace Agora. The bot, as well as the items it purchased, was displayed during an exhibition at the Kunst Halle St Gallen art gallery in St. Gallen, Switzerland.  According to a 15th January blog post, the bot was confiscated by the St Gallen public prosecutor’s office, which reportedly cited safety concerns. At the time, !Mediengruppe Bitnik, the team behind the bot, called the confiscation “an unjustified intervention into freedom of art.”  The group announced earlier this week in a new blog post that the bot had been released from custody.  !Mediengruppe Bitnik said that it no longer faced the threat of prosecution in connection with the shopping bot, writing:  “At the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution. In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition.”  Apart from the ecstasy, which the group said was destroyed by law enforcement officials, all other purchased items were returned along with the bot.

42378165,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MLGD,1429296210,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Child Porn and Price Disregarded,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at bitcoin news, analysing media and its impact.  Whilst last week's reporting was heavily US-focused, the coverage this week was more far reaching, with outlets from India and Russia mentioning bitcoin – even if in a negative light.  Indeed the biggest lightning rod of interest this week was perhaps bitcoin's alleged propensity for enabling illicit activities, with the use of the payment method in online child pornography transactions capturing the lion's share of the media's headlines.  Interestingly this focus, however, did deflect from other negative coverage.  For example, bitcoin's relative price drop – usually a hot topic among the mainstream press – went mostly unnoticed.  Child porn for bitcoin  Allegations that paedophiles are now buying sexually abusive imagery on the web first surfaced this week following the release of the Internet Watch Foundation's annual report.  Unsurprisingly, it did not take long for the media to seize the opportunity to report on the link between the disruptive digital currency and the horrendous activities carried out by some alleged bitcoin users.  A Google news search with the terms ""paedophiles and bitcoin"" brought up more than 80 results, significantly less than previous stories highlighted in this series, but still this week's most widely covered topic.  In his Guardian piece ""Paedophiles sell child abuse images for bitcoin"", Alex Hern commented on how the digital currency's inherent characteristics make it a suitable tool for illicit activity.  Hern said:  ""Bitcoin has a number of properties which make it well suited for trading illegal material such as child sex abuse images. The cryptocurrency is completely decentralised, which means that no single authority can prevent trades from being made, or blacklist buyers and sellers.""  The Metro's Harry Redhead, finished his piece on a questionable conclusion:  ""Bitcoin is notoriously hard to trace as all transactions are encrypted. There have been a number of reports linking its use to illegal activity.""  Not entirely the case, as evidenced by recent investigations and convictions carried out by various law enforcement agencies, which proved just how traceable bitcoin transactions can be. Hern agreed, noting that while the currency is often described as anonymous and untraceable, ""there are a number of elements to its design which law enforcement authorities have been able to use to track down people attempting to use bitcoin illegally"".  The Guardian's journalist goes one step further, adding:  ""The decentralised nature of the currency means that every single transaction is made public, and in order to convert bitcoins into a controversial currency, they must typically be bought and sold through a bitcoin exchange. Those exchanges are often legally required to keep detailed records on customers, in order to comply with money-laundering regulations.""  Interestingly, the news also caught the attention of The Times of India and Russian outlet MK-London, although both fell somewhat short in their coverage, as they perhaps mischaracterized the fact that bitcoin was easily used to embark in illicit activities.  Sky News pointed out that bitcoin was not without controversy, adding that ""there have been numerous reports of it being used for illegal activity"".  Price fails to capture  Bitcoin's price has previously managed to capture a sizeable amount of the media's attention, especially when it declines.  In January, the price of bitcoin dropped from $224 to around $175 (a decline of approximately 22%) in just a matter of hours, before rebounding again.  At the time, the decline in value sent shockwaves that spread far beyond the bitcoin community. The New York Times spoke of a possible market squeeze.  FT Alphaville's report, on the other hand, read like a bitcoin obituary and The Sydney Morning Herald described bitcoin's entry into 2015 as ""appalling,"" claiming that the currency appeared to be in free fall.  According to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index, the price of bitcoin dropped from $236 last Friday to $216 on Tuesday this week, reaching its second lowest value since January this year.  Despite many commentators, such as the The Wall Street Journal's Michael Casey previously saying that bitcoin's price doesn't matter, the truth is that the digital currency's value has been hotly debated topic among the media.  It seems that, at least for now, mainstream journalists left the reporting on the price to the bitcoin press, though even here it was greeted with a lukewarm response.  As for whether this marks any change in how media outlets will potentially report on future declines, however, remains to be seen.

42378161,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MLCR,1429286920,Simplicity is Bitcoin Investment App Lawnmower's Strength and Weakness,"Name of product: Lawnmower  What it is: Bitcoin's take on the popular investment app Acorns, Lawnmower rounds traditional bank card purchases up to the nearest dollar and invests the change in bitcoin.  Made by: Lawnmower.io  Who’s behind it: Three University of Florida classmates Pieter Gorsira, Patrick Archambeau and Alex Sunnarborg and strategic backers Boost VC.  Cost: Free  Date launched: 9th April  Basic summary: Lawnmower provides a painless way for users to start saving bitcoin in incremental amounts.  CoinDesk rating: 3.5/5  The basics: Available as an iOS app and currently in Android beta, Lawnmower creates a Coinbase wallet for users, connecting the address to a bank account or credit card. Lawnmower monitors the user's traditional purchases, rounding transactions to the nearest dollar, or in the case of a $3.00 transaction, the next dollar, converting this ""change"" to bitcoin.  Using the service  To install the service, iOS users download the app to their preferred device. From there, sign-up is broken down into a three-step process.  The app is currently limited to users of one of five traditional banking partners, all of whose services can be accessed via financial API platform Plaid. Available banks currently include Bank of America, Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo and US Bank.  Once selected, users must correctly answer security passwords used in conjunction with their account. Unlike when accessing online banking, users must correctly answer all questions before moving forward. Lawnmower then displays a screen indicating that it has yet to detect any transaction activity, one that is eventually populated with a history of its purchases.  The app requires a minimum of $4 be collected in clippings from purchases before it purchases bitcoin on behalf of the user.  Pros  - Easy signup process for Coinbase users  - Straightforward user interface shows bitcoin accrued, the dollar equivalent and a history of recent purchases at a glance.  Cons  - Limited currently to USD investors  - Requires Coinbase account  - Stats page yet to be developed  - Users currently limited to one investment option.  Security  As for security, Lawmower outsources most of the responsibility to its related third-party providers. Banking transaction data is stored outside the app by API provider Plaid, while users can only sell or send bitcoin through their Coinbase accounts.  Conclusion  Given the overly ambitious aims of many companies in the space, Lawnmower should be lauded for its success at delivering on a simplistic vision. Further, it provides what is most likely the easiest way to purchase bitcoins, requiring only that users to opt in to a program and go about their normal business.  As for how it ultimately delivers on its value proposition to investors, however, that depends on the point of view of the user. Alternative apps, like Acorns for example, offer a wide range of investment options, from government bonds to real estate stocks, diversity that isn't yet available in the Lawnmower app.  Lawnmower's ultimate usefulness as an investment tool may be dependent on the wider success of cryptocurrency as an asset class, though whether bitcoin will be enough to attract a large target market of investors looking to grow their savings, and by extension, Lawnmower as a company, remains to be seen.
