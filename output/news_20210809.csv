42397052,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYXNP,1628553020,Institutional Investors Return to Bitcoin Despite US Crypto Tax Plans,"Lawmakers and regulators’ increasing scrutiny of crypto markets, including the debate over the U.S. infrastructure bill’s crypto tax reporting provision, may be spooking retail investors but not institutional ones, recent blockchain data from Glassnode indicates.      These larger investors, as represented by large-value dollar transactions, fueled bitcoin’s nearly 20% price gains since last week, the Berlin-based blockchain data firm found. A number of analysts say the trend shows that these institutions are focusing more on the cryptocurrency’s upside than on potential obstacles.      “Investors are looking to the positives around regulation rather than the negative,” said Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at institutional crypto exchange LMAX Digital, noting that “the fact that the U.S. government is listening and is aware that there is a provision around crypto in the infrastructure bill that needs more clarification.”      Bitcoin’s on-chain transaction volume with values of at least $1 million has risen 10% since the beginning of August and accounts for nearly 70% of the total value transferred.      This blockchain metric represents rising institutional activities on the Bitcoin network because ""retail investors rarely move transactions [with values of at least $1 million] on a scale to create such dominance,"" said a blockchain analyst at Glassnode who goes by the name ""Checkmate.""      ""The rising dominance also correlates with [massive] Coinbase exchange outflows since December 2020, which we also assign to likely US institutions,"" the analyst added.      Meanwhile, small-size transactions have declined as a percentage of the overall market, as shown by the chart below. Transactions valued less than $1 million have dropped to around 30-40% of market dominance from 70% since July 2020.      Institutional investors’ recent bullishness comes as the crypto market monitors intense political and regulatory developments worldwide, including a hotly debated $28 billion tax reporting provision in the $1 trillion infrastructure bill in the U.S. and a crackdown in Europe and other regions against Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange by trading volume.      Despite the potential for greater regulatory oversight, institutional investors are optimistic about bitcoin’s future, analysts and industry experts say.      “In general, institutions would welcome regulation that is clear and fair,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier. “The recent price increase over the last week ... has shown that the market does not react strongly to concerns over regulation, as opposed to actual legislation passing.”      In the latest infrastructure bill development on Monday, U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) filed an objection to a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provision. The amendment would have exempted crypto transaction validators from a broadened definition of “broker.”      Kruger said that increased regulation helps validate the industry.      “This means the industry is getting recognized and this ultimately helps with acceptance and adoption,” Kruger said.      Others also said that the crypto market has become more used to news coming from regulators as the industry matures.      “The crypto market is very used to regulatory concerns, especially the crypto OG (original gangsters) hodlers (long-time holders) who have seen multiple cycles of regulatory uncertainty,” Tu said.      Indeed, on a 14-day median basis, the average number of days each BTC transacted remained dormant or unmoved, has risen slightly to around 10 days from seven days, according to Glassnode, meaning that some bitcoin “old hands are not taking exit liquidity at this stage.”    Market fundamentals turn stronger, healthier    Instead of focusing on regulatory uncertainties, institutional investors have highlighted bitcoin’s strengthening market fundamentals as a justification for their optimism.      “The regulatory concerns don't impact bitcoin here as much as other cryptocurrencies, and the sentiment behind bitcoin has been showing signs of turning for a couple of weeks now,” said Noelle Acheson, head of Market Insights at Genesis. (Genesis is owned by CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.)      On the supply side, bitcoin’s illiquid supply, or the balance held by illiquid entities, reached a record high recently, meaning that the oldest cryptocurrency has a weakness in supply.      The perpetual derivatives market’s funding rates have turned positive again after they went negative for most of June and July.      Calculated every eight hours, the funding rate refers to the cost of holding long/short positions in the bitcoin perpetuals (futures with no expiry) market. The metric is used by exchanges offering perpetuals to balance the market and guide perpetual prices toward the spot price.      A positive funding rate means longs are paying shorts to keep the position open, and the market is skewed bullish. Meanwhile, a negative funding rate implies a bearish market positioning.      As CoinDesk reported, bitcoin’s put-call open position ratio also recently dropped to the lowest level this year on increased activity in calls, or bullish bets.      At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $46,201.20, up by 5.32% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/09/institutional-investors-return-to-bitcoin-despite-us-crypto-tax-plans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00f0b37cb97a36571427a266463dbe32f4744279-1996x1330.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

AMC did not specify what technology it would use to process the payments. The company has 593 theaters in the U.S. and 335 international locations.      Aron said that AMC will also begin accepting Apple Pay and Google Pay payments by the end of 2021.      AMC's stock was trading at roughly $33 Monday morning. After the earnings release, the stock jumped 13.2% before falling to about $35 at the time of publication.

Following the Hard Fork and the implementation of EIP-1559, the price of ETH has continuously run-up, as interest in the Ethereum network grows. The price broke $3K for the first time in over a month during the weekend, which saw the price of bitcoin surge past $44K. ETH price promptly followed the price rally. Although the price of ETH has fluctuated following this, breaking back down below $3,000, the price has since recovered back up above $3,000.

42397044,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYXGW,1628542809,Congress’s Misstep on Crypto Reporting Shows the Dangerous Allure of Surveillance,"The U.S. Senate may be nearing a compromise solution to fix a controversial cryptocurrency tax-reporting measure in the omnibus infrastructure bill. The intent of the measure was to impose 1099 tax reporting requirements on crypto exchanges and other companies that handle investments. But because of poorly crafted language, the original measure could have also covered cryptocurrency miners and software developers, who do not and cannot track the real-world identities of users.      On Monday afternoon, original sponsor Rob Portman (R-Ohio) announced a compromise had been reached to exclude “non brokers,” so, fingers crossed, revised language will address the problems. Whatever the outcome, the push for a compromise revision has been made possible by a huge groundswell of activism from U.S. citizens, including floods of emails and phone calls to Senate offices, and loud objections to the measure from figures from Square CEO Jack Dorsey to Gene Simmons of Kiss.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    One of the main sources of angst was the possibility the measure might impose tax reporting requirements on software developers who design financial tools and systems, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and digital wallets for storing crypto keys. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a pro-digital rights group, the measure could “force software creators … to create cumbersome surveillance systems or stop offering services in the United States.”      This is a problem for a number of obvious reasons. The overriding issue is that, according to current U.S. case law, software is a form of speech, and thus protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution – a protection first established in a case about encryption. It would certainly be a matter for the courts if the initial language were to go into effect. Apple, for instance, was poised to use this argument in 2016 when the FBI tried to force it to create phone-unlocking software, though that case didn’t go to trial.      But that’s just the formal legal issue with the provision. The intensity of the backlash suggests something more visceral than mere constitutional angst. One explanation, I think, is that the measure would do something fundamentally un-American: make a crime not just illegal, but impossible.      This all started, remember, as a measure about tax reporting. Requiring tax reporting from crypto entities was expected to raise about $28 billion in revenue to offset new spending for priorities like highways and trains. Fair enough! As myself and many others have made clear, the fight here isn’t against taxing cryptocurrency capital gains. Entities like Coinbase should absolutely report the tax information the government wants. Individuals should track and report transactions that take place elsewhere ​​– and they should be pursued and punished by the justice system if they don’t.      But making it illegal to build financial software without built-in tax reporting features is a whole different kettle of fish. Such a mandate could be compared to a law requiring that every dollar bill be tagged with a GPS chip and tracked to ensure that it isn’t spent on anything illegal. Or to a law requiring all guns be equipped with a target camera and AI system to ensure they’re not being used to shoot the wrong things.      Translating the original tax measure into real-world terms illuminates why it met so much resistance. These are obviously absurd proposals that would fundamentally conflict with the American ethos by putting immense and direct control of individual decisions in the hands of the government. When it comes to paper money or guns, our deep cultural bias is towards leaving it up to individuals to choose to use them wisely and properly, while making sure they face justice if and when they commit a crime. (The actual way people behave with guns certainly leaves that stance open for scrutiny, but that’s a topic for another day.)    Read more: Money Reimagined: Gensler’s SEC Is the Same Old SEC | Michael Casey    That Portman’s original language looped in so many non-brokers may mostly reflect regulators’ ignorance about the structure of decentralized systems. But it also reflects a deeper failure to think of digital systems through the same ethical framework of personal responsibility that we apply in the physical world. We saw another major sign of this bias recently at Apple, which after years of touting its commitment to privacy and security now plans to start monitoring user communications for child pornography – a measure that would be clearly morally repugnant if it involved monitoring the physical mail of millions of people as a way to catch predators.      To put it directly, the government should concern itself with catching criminals, not with outlawing tools with potential criminal uses. This is an especially important value to defend as financial systems become increasingly digital, in part for the same reason the Second Amendment exists: Limiting government power helps keep it honest. And as inconvenient as this truth may be, defending the right to financial privacy in the 21st century will be inextricable from defending individuals’ ability to commit crimes using unmonitored financial tools.      There is a further bit of infuriating context here. One reason the crypto-reporting provision was added so hastily to the infrastructure bill is that in late July, Republicans in Congress killed another pay-for in the bill: an additional $100 billion in revenue that would have come from enhancing IRS enforcement of tax laws on corporations and the top 1% of income earners.      On the face of it, this is enraging because it shows Congress knows there’s a boatload of tax avoidance going on among the wealthy and corporations, but finds it more politically expedient to squeeze a nascent industry than putting more cops on an existing but poorly enforced beat.      But more deeply, it speaks to the profound allure that automated surveillance and censorship hold for the government, and why it demands strong opposition, not just when it comes to crypto, but in all walks of life.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

42397049,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYXMQ,1628540898,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rallies Ahead of Senate Compromise,"Cryptocurrencies are in rally mode as bitcoin held above $45,000 on Monday. Buyers were active ahead of a U.S. Senate compromise on tax-reporting requirements for digital assets. Crypto-related stocks such as Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) and Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) moved higher in a mixed day for the overall stock market in hopes for regulatory clarity.      Ether was also well bid above $3,000 at press time and is up 21% over the past week, compared with an 18% rise in bitcoin during the same period.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $46190.3, +5.91%  Ether (ETH) $3162.7, +6.51%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4432.4, -0.09%  Gold: $1729.9, -1.88%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.318%, compared with 1.307% on Friday.  Bitcoin above 200-day moving average    Bitcoin pierced the 200-day moving average for the first time since April 2020, which preceded a broad crypto rally. “With bitcoin crossing above its 200-day, we think bitcoin will rally strongly into year-end,” Thomas Lee, managing partner of FundStrat, wrote in a Monday newsletter.      Forward returns tend to be bullish for bitcoin after a successful break of the 200-day moving average. Technical charts suggest the next resistance will be around $50,000 to $55,000.    Kimchi premium    The “kimchi premium,” which represents the difference between bitcoin’s price on South Korean exchanges and the going rate on other global trading venues, is at a six-month low, according to data from CryptoQuant.      Typically a rising kimchi premium reflects trading frenzy in South Korea relative to the U.S. At times, a peak in the premium can precede a sell-off in bitcoin.      This time, the “kimchi discount” could reflect a significant decline in South Korean trading activity because of regulatory crackdowns.      Earlier this year, South Korea passed comprehensive cryptocurrency laws, which provided a framework for the legalization of crypto exchanges. In June, however, South Korea passed new legislation to increase supervision of cryptocurrencies. Banks have been reluctant to partner with crypto exchanges amid growing concerns about regulatory crackdowns and the financial risk of stablecoins.    Digital asset fund flows    Despite experiencing outflows for the fifth straight week, digital-asset funds saw their assets under management hit their highest level since mid-May, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma wrote.      The market share for ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall after bitcoin by market cap, is rising rapidly and now represents 26% of all digital investment products, compared with just 11% at the beginning of the year.      Although bitcoin has also seen positive price movements in the last few weeks, the cryptocurrency continued to bear the brunt of the outflows, totaling $33 million last week.    Ether implied volatility    Ether’s implied volatility dropped sharply last week as the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 30%. The sell-off in implied volatility was particularly strong on the short end of the historical term structure over the past few days, according to data from Skew.      Bullish sentiment is rising in the ether options market as call volumes increase relative to put volumes. Option traders are pricing in a roughly 30% chance of ETH trading above $3,500 by month’s end.    Altcoin roundup  Tether reveals more details about its reserves: Tether Holdings Ltd., issuer of the largest stablecoin USDT, has provided in a new attestation report more details than ever before on the composition of its $62.8 billion of reserves. According to the report, $30.8 billion, or 49% of Tether’s reserves, was held in CP and CDs, out of which roughly 93% was rated A-2 and above and 1.5% below A-3 as of June 30. Tether’s executives earlier told CNBC that the commercial paper it held was rated “overwhelmingly rated A-2 or better.”  Circle says it wants to be a national crypto bank: Circle, which is planning to go public, said Monday it intends to become “a full-reserve national commercial bank.” If it gets regulatory approval, the proposed digital currency bank would operate under the supervision of the U.S. Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). ​​“We are embarking on this journey alongside the efforts of the top U.S. financial regulators, who through the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets are seeking to better manage the risks and opportunities posed by large-scale private-sector dollar digital currencies,” Circle said in a blog post.  Wormhole Launches: Wormhole, a communication bridge between Solana and other top decentralized finance (DeFi) networks, began supporting inter-blockchain message transfers on Monday. In simple terms, the protocol will help crypto assets like tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and even price data, flow between blockchain networks that don’t usually talk to each other. Wormhole supports the Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Terra.  Binance to Perform Reverse Splits on UNIDOWN, LTCDOWN: The exchange will consolidate UNIDOWN and LTCDOWN tokens by 100,000 to 1. Crypto exchange Binance said it will perform reverse splits on certain trading tokens linked to litecoin and uniswap. UNIDOWN and LTCDOWN – which generate leveraged gains when the underlying crypto assets decrease in price – will undergo a 100,000:1 reverse token split. The process consolidates existing tokens into a smaller number with higher value.

42397038,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYX9d,1628537618,Gary Gensler’s Insane Crypto Policy,"Does cryptocurrency need new regulatory disclosure mandates from Washington, D.C., to be of service to consumers? No, but that is what Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler is seeking.      As stated in a speech on Aug. 3, Gensler indicated he wants to double down on the same tried-and-failed approach his predecessor used. From disclosure-heavy mandates to investor-protection obsession, everything he has proposed is a regulatory version of insanity – doing the same things but expecting different results.    Paul H. Jossey is an adjunct fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and founder of thecrowdfundinglawyers.com.    Under the guise of technology neutrality, Gensler seeks to force the crypto industry to heel to the SEC. As he stated, “I think former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said it well when he testified in 2018: 'To the extent that digital assets like [initial coin offerings, or ICOs] are securities – and I believe every ICO I have seen is a security – we have jurisdiction, and our federal securities laws apply.'”      Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find a crypto innovation over which he doesn’t want to exert control. Stablecoins? Check. Exchanges? Check. Decentralized finance (DeFi)? Check.      That hasn't gone well so far.      By any account, the commission’s crypto policy has been a mess. Former Chairman Clayton seemed perpetually perplexed by such new technologies, finally appointing a crypto “Czar” – career bureaucrat Valerie Szczepanik – in 2018. A year later she and Corporation Finance Director William Hinman produced a widely panned 13-page crypto “framework.” The document was so impenetrable, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce compared it to a highly abstract Jackson Pollock painting.    Read more: Money Reimagined: Gensler’s SEC Is the Same Old SEC | Michael J. Casey    The other major Clayton-era guidance came from a 2018 speech where Hinman declared ether, the currency for the second-biggest crypto blockchain, Ethereum, was not a security. The crypto world cheered. But in the closely watched Ripple litigation, the commission has now disavowed that finding.      Other than these two instances, SEC ""guidance"" has largely come not from official rulemaking but from punitive subpoenas and court appearances.      But even if the commission was less scattershot, it’s not clear forcing the nascent industry into a Depression-era disclosure regime would protect those retail investors Gensler has in mind.      A review of recent press releases reveals multiple enforcement cases against alleged fraudsters that were already beholden to commission mandates. Empirical studies have repeatedly shown the federal disclosure regime does more to employ myriad compliance professionals than stop scam artists.      It is also telling that the least regulated way issuers can raise capital – Regulation D 506(b) (Reg D), which mandates no disclosures – is also the most successful. In 2019, it raised $1.5 trillion and outpaced the public markets, an impossibility if investors feared widespread fraud.      Too bad that securities law paternalistically blocks most investors from Reg D opportunities. Only 13% of potential investors qualify because financial and sophistication thresholds limit eligibility. And they tend to cluster in America’s elite zip codes, meaning the best deals go to people who need them least.      Retail investors are mostly left with post-IPO scraps. As Georgia School of Law professor Usha Rodrigues states, “Securities law ... in theory, as in practice, marginalizes the average investor without acknowledging that it does so, let alone justifying it.”    Read more: Poloniex Agrees to $10M Settlement With SEC for Operating Unregistered Exchange    Under Gensler’s crypto leadership, this financial marginalization will continue to block opportunities for wealth creation where they are greatest (perhaps in all of history).      Instead, Gensler should change course and approach crypto with a measure of humility and cooperation. This would include:    Ditch the 2019 framework  Acknowledge the commission’s role in creating the uncertainty surrounding crypto’s security status  Ask Congress to update the definition of security to clearly define what digital assets fall under the commission’s ambit and which do not  Drop all prosecutions against non-fraudulent crypto issuers and impose a moratorium against further prosecutions until Congress updates its definitions  Direct all crypto prosecutions against alleged fraudsters    SEC regulators should want to give honest innovators certainty and breathing space. A more circumspect approach would also put major crypto policy questions back to Congress to decide and allow everyday Americans to explore the ingenuity crypto has to offer.

The Wall Street Journal was first to report the news of the former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official leaving the company at the end of July.      The rift points to a strategy shift within the publicly traded crypto exchange, unnamed sources told the paper, with Coinbase deciding to ""shift its priorities away from digital-asset securities,"" the report said.      A source with knowledge of the situation told CoinDesk the priority shift reflected growing consumer demand for access to decentralized finance (DeFi). “As we looked at prioritizing DeFi, we deprioritized the digital-asset securities area,” the source said.      The reportedly ""amicable"" split with Redfearn comes as actions in Washington and beyond cast doubt on whether tokenized stocks comply with current regulatory frameworks. Binance, in particular, has been hit hard for its securities product, abruptly discontinuing the product in mid-July.

Indicators have been turning decisively bullish, as short positions get liquidated with every new level taken by the bulls. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $45,858 with a 2.6% and 14.8% profit in the daily chart. The market capitalization sits at around $860 billion, closer to its previous high north of $1 trillion. After making an upwards move from the lows at $30,000, BTC&apos;s price faced some resistance at $40,000 and $42,000 but was able to turn them into support. The next key resistances were located at $45,000 and $47,000, as trader Justin Bennett said. The former was reclaimed in the past 24 hours, if the bulls can sustain the bullish momentum, $47,000 should be the final obstacle before a potential move to $65,000, Bitcoin&apos;s previous all-time high. Bennett added: Flip $47,000 to support on the daily and weekly time frames, and the bull run likely continues to $100,000+. Looking for $40,000 to hold as support.

42397050,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYXLR,1628530006,Crypto Coin Listings Exploded in 2021,"In the first half of 2021 data aggregator CoinMarketCap added 2,655 new crypto assets to its database, bringing the total number of listed coins to 10,810, according to data shared with CoinDesk.      For perspective, in 2018, during the peak of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, CoinMarketCap listed its 2,000th asset on its website.      This year “saw a Cambrian explosion of new crypto assets largely as a consequence of several tailwinds,” said Aaron Khoo, head of listings at CoinMarketCap, referring to the evolutionary event that took place 541 million years ago when large numbers of new organisms seemingly burst into existence.      Like CoinMarketCap, two other data aggregators also added 2,000 or more new assets to their databases in 2021. Singapore-headquartered CoinGecko listed 3,064 new assets on its website while the smaller, Poland-based crypto data and research platform Coinpaprika listed 2,000 new assets. Wojciech Maciejewski, business development manager at Coinpaprika, said the platform is currently inundated with new applications for coin listings.      “We don’t have enough people to go through all the applications,” Maciejewski said, adding that the platform is working on a system that can process more applications.      Representatives from CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko and Coinpaprika agree the 2021 surge in new crypto assets is driven by a combination of bullish price action, the influx of traditional financial institutions, influencers and celebrities to the space, along with the non-fungible token (NFT) boom and the rise of meme coins like dogecoin, shiba and safemoon.      But this is not the first time the crypto space has witnessed a dramatic surge in new assets. After the initial coin offering (ICO) boom kicked off in 2017, new crypto assets poured into the market much in the same way. However, more than three-quarters of those ICOs turned out to be scams, while almost half failed to raise funds.      And if history’s any indicator, of the thousands of new crypto assets that have exploded onto the market in 2021, only a few will survive.      “We have no data to back that but the expectation is that [the new assets] are more or less similar to the 2017 ICO round where only a handful managed to stick around after the initial craze,” Sze Jin Teh, principal product manager at CoinGecko, said in an email.    Behind the numbers    Between 2014 and 2021, almost 16,000 crypto assets were created, according to data from CoinGecko.      But this number includes all coins, both active as well as inactive assets (assets attached to disrupted projects).      For instance, according to Maciejewski, active assets on Coinpaprika account for around half of the 8,000 or more assets listed on the site.      And a portion of these deactivated crypto assets were born out of the ICO boom.      CoinGecko, for instance, recorded its monthly high for the number of new coins listed on its platform in 2017, according to data shared with CoinDesk. The platform listed 914 assets in December 2017 alone.      According to Kristian Kho, operations lead at CoinGecko, December 2017 was the peak of the ICO craze when retail interest in crypto rose, coinciding with the all-time high bitcoin price at the time. “This was the first time we saw a rush of a new class of tokens being created to capitalize on the success of the first few trailblazers (Filecoin, Tezos, EOS and the like). We even created a dedicated ICO page to track all the ongoing ICOs back then,” Kho said.  But a majority of those tokens were short-lived.      “Many of the projects that had raised funds simply dissolved upon exhausting their runways,” said Kho.      But Jin said even more coins have popped up this time around compared to 2017, and across multiple chains including Ethereum, Polygon and Binance Smart Chain.      “There are more and more new ideas, but also more scams that we have to inform our users of,” Maciejewski said, adding that Coinpaprika is receiving up to seven times more requests than it did in 2018.      And these staggering numbers still don’t reflect the total amount of crypto assets floating around the internet.      “The coins listed on CoinMarketCap represent a thin sliver (~20% approval rate) of the total number of new coin applications,” Khoo said in an email to CoinDesk.      According to Khoo, during the first half of 2021, CoinMarketCap received a whopping 10,793 applications from crypto projects and companies seeking to have their new assets listed.    The vetting process    To face the rising numbers of crypto assets and listing applications, each listing platform has its own set of criteria for approving a new asset.      CoinMarketCap reviews an extensive list of metrics shared on its website, but according to Khoo, there is also an element of competitive benchmarking, by comparing the asset to other, similar applicants.      “Listing evaluation by CoinGecko is done holistically with a set of internal criteria used to evaluate each coin. The exact listing criteria are not disclosed to prevent manipulation by the project team,” Kho said in a written statement.      But both platforms, along with Coinpaprika, look closely at the coin’s active trading volume and liquidity, along with other factors including social media presence, community attitude towards the coin and the team behind the project.      According to CoinGecko’s Kho, the rise of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where the listing is permissionless and fees are low, has made it even easier to create and market coins. This means anyone can tokenize anything, fuelling the strange new world of meme coins, Kho said.  “In light of this, CoinGecko has become much stricter in listing new tokens. This is because the instances of scam coins have increased with the rise of DEXs,” Kho said.      Currently, Coinpaprika accepts 95% of requests for assets already listed on centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, discarding only incomplete applications. But when it comes to DEXs, the acceptance rate drops to around 60% or 70% because they do not typically have stable or reliable API endpoints (communication channels) due to their decentralized nature.    Meme coin rush    According to Kho, the highest percentage of applications received at CoinGecko are for meme coins.      “The popularity and price increase of meme coins such as dogecoin and shiba inu coin has inspired many to come up with their own derivative meme coins in the hopes of capturing the success of the former two,” Kho said.       He added that the ease of creating a simple token allows anyone to launch a meme coin, and with it apply for listing at CoinGecko.      “In the last quarter, meme coins (especially those of the canine variety) dominated new coin applications, accounting for roughly three out of four new applications,” Khoo from CoinMarketCap said in an email to CoinDesk.      He also said that in keeping with the meteoric rise of Axie Infinity, a game partly owned and operated by its players, CoinMarketCap is witnessing a modest uptick in NFTs and gaming coins.      But 2021’s meme coins appear to be the assets that most resemble 2017’s ICO tokens in terms of quantity and longevity.      “Meme tokens tend to be ephemeral, and I'd say that approximately 75% of them meet a quick death if they do not go viral within the first few months,” Khoo said.      He explained that the biggest determinants of failure are a hastily cobbled-together team looking to make a quick buck and the absence of true believers rallying around a common cause within the coins' respective communities.      But it’s still too early to tell the fate of the nascent crypto assets that have just joined the market, according to Kho.      “Quantity is there but quality remains very subjective – among meme tokens and yield farms, there are projects genuinely looking to improve the space so it probably still takes time before we are able to tell,” Kho said.      UPDATE (Aug 11, 2021, 10:01 UTC): After this story was published, Coinpaprika contacted CoinDesk to clarify the number of total assets listed on the platform.

42397034,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYX5h,1628529793,Tether Reveals More Details About Its Reserves,"Tether Holdings Ltd., issuer of the largest stablecoin USDT, has provided in a new attestation report more details than ever before on the composition of its $62.8 billion of reserves.      Such information was long awaited by investors. In March, the company released its first attestation report, which revealed the amount of its assets and liabilities. In May, Tether published a breakdown of its reserves, showing that about 50% of its reserves was held in commercial paper. But that breakdown report was not ""attested"" to.      In the latest attestation report, Tether not only included the composition of its reserves, but also provided a breakdown of the ratings and maturity of its commercial paper (CP) and certificates of deposit (CDs).      According to the report dated June 30, $30.8 billion, or 49% of Tether's reserves, was held in CP and CDs, out of which roughly 93% was rated A-2 and above and 1.5% below A-3. Tether’s executives earlier told CNBC that the commercial paper it held was rated “overwhelmingly rated A-2 or better.”    Assets versus liabilities    Tether had $62.8 billion in total assets as of June 30, up from $41 billion on March 31, when its last attestation report was dated.      Tether has a circulating supply of $62.7 billion as of Monday, according to CoinGecko.      Other reserves included $6.28 billion cash and bank deposits, or 10% of the total, $1 billion in reverse repo notes (1.6%) and $15.28 billion of U.S. Treasury bills (24.3%), based on the attestation. In the May breakdown, Tether reported that commercial paper accounted for about 50% of its reserves, fiduciary deposits 18%, cash 2.9%, reverse repo notes 2.7% and Treasury bills 2.2%.      The company also held $2.52 billion secured loans and $4.83 billion corporate bonds, funds and precious metals, which accounted for 4% and 7.7% of its reserves, respectively. Tether noted in the report that its secured loans were “none to affiliated entities.” Tether’s “other investments” including digital tokens were $2.05 billion, or 3.3%, of the reserves.      According to the May breakdown, about 13% of Tether's reserves was in secured loans, while 10% was in corporate bonds and precious metals. Some 1.6% was in ""other investments (including digital tokens).""      ​​As of June 30, Tether was the defendant in four ongoing legal cases, “the outcomes of which cannot yet be reasonably reliably estimated by management,"" according to the report.      ""Any contingent liability in respect of these proceedings has not been accrued,” the report said.    Breakdown of commercial paper and certificates of deposit    Roughly $149.8 million, or 0.5% of Tether’s CP and CDs, was rated above A-1.      About $14.5 billion, or 47% of total CP and CDs, was rated A-1. The company’s holdings that were rated A-2 and A-3 were $14 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, taking up 45% and 5.5% of the total CP and CDs allocation.      About $459.3 million, or 1.5% of the CP and CDs, was rated below A-3, according to the report.      The ratings referred to short-term credit ratings by Standard & Poor’s, when available, Tether said. Otherwise, “publicly available industry standard conversion tables have been used to convert ratings from Moody’s or Fitch to the S&P equivalent,” according to the report.            The company didn’t disclose any issuers of the commercial paper.      About $10.6 billion, or 34% of its CP and CDs, had maturities of three months or less. Roughly $6.5 billion, or 21% of its CP and CDs, will mature in more than three months and fewer than six months, and $13.7 billion, or 45%, had maturities of more than six months and less than a year.",POSITIVE,USDT,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Frances Yue,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/09/tether-reveals-more-details-about-its-reserves,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/621d3d05d646f4917ca05dfc62a053f473eddef9-1500x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42397040,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYXBb,1628527631,Against the US Senate’s Heavy-Handed Crypto Provision,"CoinDesk almost never adopts a formal editorial position on issues. We feature a wide variety of outside and internal opinion pieces, including those the two of us pen in our personal capacities. We usually leave the task of presenting the organization’s common perspective to the breadth and balance of the newsroom’s reporting, rather than explicitly taking an official point of view on any given topic.      We now feel compelled to make what will be an extremely rare break with that tradition, in response to the U.S. Congress’s deliberations over competing amendments to a controversial cryptocurrency provision in the infrastructure bill.    Michael J. Casey is CoinDesk’s chief content officer. Marc Hochstein is CoinDesk’s executive editor. The views expressed are not necessarily shared by all members of the editorial staff.    We write to state that CoinDesk endorses the changes floated in an amendment to the bill proposed by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Unfortunately, that amendment did not make it to a vote. Under the circumstances, we urge lawmakers to vote against the entire bill unless the crypto provision is removed or sufficiently modified before the final vote. (As we were finishing this editorial, a compromise among Republicans, Democrats and the Treasury Department was announced but its passage is far from certain.) We favor debating the very complicated crypto issues regulated in this package in a separate, properly considered bill.      There are arguments for and against Congress procuring an estimated $1 trillion to improve the nation’s outdated, creaking infrastructure. Our point is not to support either side in that debate, merely to argue that ramming through this bill should not be done at the cost of curtailing innovation in one of the most promising technologies of the digital age and, more alarmingly, impeding on the civil liberties Americans hold dear. The bill has the potential to thrust every single transaction by U.S. crypto users into an invasive dragnet. By passing it unamended, Congress would be cutting off its nose to save its face.      The U.S. government should treat cryptocurrency as it treated the internet at the same point of its development: protect it from premature, overzealous and onerous regulations that, lacking such protections, would likely push innovation and ultimately tax revenue for the country to distant shores. If Congress wants to change or clarify how cryptocurrency is handled, it should do so in a purpose-built bill that simply does that rather than trying to backdoor major regulatory changes in a 2,500-page omnibus vehicle.      As a matter of principle, cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies are built on open-source software run by permissionless, transparent networks. In plain English: Anyone can use these networks and anyone can see what is happening on them. They are open platforms, and as such constitute a public good – with the added importance of providing what is arguably the most essential form of social infrastructure: a monetary system.      Protecting that public good is how we define our responsibility as a news organization covering the transformation of money in the 21st century. Think of it as an update to the Fourth Estate concept, applying a similar role of public accountability in the governance systems of open-source code and borderless information networks to that which the mainstream media traditionally applies to governments and big business. We cover this industry with a view that crypto technology should remain free from capture by narrow private interests, open to innovation and developed in such a way that users can freely access it without compromising their rights.      The cryptocurrency provision in this bill, with the obligation it imposes on cryptocurrency “brokers” to report users’ transactions to the Internal Revenue Service, undermines all three of those principles. Its blanket wording gives the state the potential to exert excessive influence over the technology's use, which would limit the prospects for innovation. And, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation warns, it would be “a disaster for digital privacy.”      The problem lies in the original provision’s catch-all definition of “broker,” which as written could include miners, hardware wallet makers, protocol developers and others that take no custody of customer assets and therefore should remain exempt from anti-money laundering and other reporting requirements. Large parts of the provision are unenforceable because developers of free, open-source software have no way of knowing who is using their products. Where operators do have a known customer base, the definition could enlarge a limited surveillance system into something far more comprehensive and insidious. In the end, it would be counterproductive because it would encourage developers and users to flee the U.S. for friendlier jurisdictions.      Of course, crypto investors who owe capital gains tax should be subject to the same reporting requirements that others face in the financial system. The sector could benefit from the legitimization that taxation brings. But this bill, as written, goes way too far.      Its shortfalls would have been sufficiently addressed by the bipartisan Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment, which was pulled together last week amid a mass crypto industry lobbying effort led by D.C.-based crypto interest groups Coin Center, the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the Blockchain Alliance and the Association for Digital Assets Management. The revised language sufficiently crafts the right exemptions for developers, miners and others and appropriately leaves developers free to exercise their right to code, arguably protected by the First Amendment.      The Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment received significant bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the White House and the Treasury Department weren't on board. Worried that the operation won’t amass the targeted $28 billion in new tax revenue, they backed the competing Warner-Portman-Sinema amendment that would offer certain exemptions for mining and hardware wallet providers but not much more.    Read more: Congress, Don’t Rush Regulating Crypto | Angela Walch    In many respects, this adjustment makes things worse by distinguishing between protocols. It breaks a cardinal rule of regulation: It seeks to regulate technology itself instead of its uses, inserting bureaucrats into the business of deciding which tech should or shouldn't succeed.      Ethan Buchman, co-founder of blockchain project Cosmos, acutely demonstrated the counterproductive nature of this kind of parsed wording. When the initial wording of the Warner amendment exempted proof-of-work mining but not proof-of-stake, he pointed out in a tweet that cryptographers can trivially add proof-of-work functionality to their proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms to meet the amendment’s requirements.      If it’s important that CoinDesk doesn’t pick winners and losers between competing technologies, it’s doubly important the government avoids doing so as well.      This is not to say the government doesn’t have a responsibility to ensure that people using this or any other technology operate within the law. And the industry would benefit from the legitimacy that sensible regulation can bring.      But if lawmakers want the United States to be a fertile environment for innovation, they must ensure that any new regulation doesn’t quash the capacity to innovate here. The future payoff in tax revenue will be so much higher in that vibrant new economy than under this short-sighted, traffic cop approach.      Lawmakers may be understandably eager to get this bill passed given the derelict state of the country’s infrastructure, and unwilling to hold it up over some clumsily worded language about what, to them, seems an esoteric niche. This is penny-wise and pound foolish. Not only could the bill as written hamstring the development of modern financial infrastructure, and the economic benefits that come with that, it would undermine American values of free speech and individual privacy.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Michael J.

42397043,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYXCa,1628524381,Lone Senator Rejects Crypto Compromise in Infrastructure Bill,"In a blow to the digital assets industry, the U.S. Senate did not adopt a bipartisan compromise on a crypto tax provision in its $1 trillion infrastructure bill after a vote Monday.      Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) announced the compromise was supported by Democrats, Republicans and the Treasury Department when introducing the amendment earlier in the day, saying it would exempt crypto transaction validators from a broadened definition of “broker.”      Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) filed an objection after attempting to attach his own amendment to increase military spending. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) objected to the Shelby motion, resulting in Shelby then objecting to the overall compromise.      The full text of the compromise was not immediately available, but Toomey said it would specify who has tax reporting obligations within the digital asset sector. Software developers, node operators and validators would not be required to carry or report transaction information, but brokers would be.      ""We're not proposing anything sweeping or anything radical – [the compromise] makes clear that a broker means only those persons that conduct transactions where consumers buy, sell and trade digital assets,"" Toomey said in a press conference Monday.      The text itself would define a broker as ""any person who (for consideration) regularly effectuates transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person,"" and would exclude entities that validate transactions (meaning miners or stakers) without providing other services, or entities that sell hardware or software that allow customers to control private keys, according to screenshots shared by Coin Center's Jerry Brito.      Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen seemed to express support for the compromise in a statement on Monday.      “I am grateful to Senators Warner, Portman, Sinema, Toomey and Lummis for working together on this amendment to provide clarity on important provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure deal that will make meaningful progress on tax evasion in the cryptocurrency market. I am also thankful to Chair Wyden for his leadership and engagement on these important issues,"" she said.      However, the compromise came after the Senate conducted a number of procedural votes late Sunday to advance the bill's original text. The legislative body will send the original provision to the House of Representatives.      The infrastructure bill, which has been held up repeatedly for a number of issues including the crypto provision, seeks to fund $1 trillion in both infrastructure maintenance and new initiatives like electric vehicle charging stations. Part of the bill expects to pay for these initiatives through $28 billion raised over the next 10 years through expanded crypto tax reporting requirements.      The crypto industry pushed back against the wording of this provision amid concerns that the revised definition of a “broker” would capture miners or other types of validators, hardware manufacturers, software developers and other network participants that don't have customers or otherwise any ability to comply with the information reporting rules.      Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Lummis and Toomey introduced an amendment to the Senate last week to exempt non-broker type entities from the legislation. Earlier on Monday, Wyden said, ""I don’t believe the cryptocurrency amendment language on offer is good enough to protect privacy and security, but it’s certainly better than the underlying bill. Majority Leader [Charles] Schumer says he won’t block a unanimous consent request on it.""      Sens. Ron Portman (R-Ohio), Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) also introduced an amendment, which would only exempt validators from proof-of-work or proof-of-stake networks. The White House previously announced its support for this amendment.      All six senators support the new compromise, Toomey said.      Crypto isn’t the only issue that held up passage of the overall infrastructure bill in the Senate. Rather, it has been one of a handful.      It was non-crypto issues that held up debate and votes on Sunday, according to multiple reporters in Washington.      UPDATE (Aug. 9, 2021, 21:25 UTC): Adds text from the bill, adds a statement from Janet Yellen, adds updates after a vote was held on Monday.

42397042,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYXEY,1628523567,Why Enterprises Should Build on Public Blockchains,"Spoiler alert: Private blockchains have no compelling value proposition. If you and a bunch of other companies could agree upon a single vendor to build and run a blockchain, you could just as easily agree upon the rules of setting up a centralized server. Blockchains, as just about any technical expert will tell you, are complicated and expensive to build and run. If you just need a database and a web server, they don’t make a lot of sense.      Defenders of private blockchains will cite the decentralization of decision-making, distribution of data and redundancy as benefits, but all of these capabilities are easily replicated at a lower cost with existing fault-tolerant, disaster-resistant services that have proven track records of 99.999% uptime and a more mature development ecosystem.    Paul Brody is a CoinDesk columnist and blockchain lead at EY. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Indeed, most enterprises have come to that conclusion. A survey commissioned by EY and Forrester in 2019 showed that for each company that was willing to join another company’s private blockchain, two companies started their own. There is no path there to sustainable network scale. Nearly 75% of private blockchain users believe the best future path is on a public network.      So why is it that so many companies continue to invest in private blockchains? The answer is that large enterprises are deeply risk-averse. They want to get to the real thing: public blockchains; they just want to get there in the lowest risk manner possible.      The most common road map is the creation of a separate Ethereum-based private blockchain with the intent to connect and migrate to the public Ethereum main network in the future once the entities involved are comfortable with the technology. The problem is that permissioned systems are much too easy to customize in ways that make them unsustainable in the long-term.      The result is private blockchains that, while operating in the Ethereum ecosystem, are designed for a world where all the participants are carefully vetted, and the security risks are low or manageable and there’s no such thing as an irreversible transaction. Private blockchains can be rolled back and restored from backups, and rules and systems can be changed. They store sensitive user and customer data, run hugely complex smart contracts and never charge anyone gas fees. It’s like blockchain technology without everything that’s scary about blockchains – irreversible transactions, total transparency, aggressive hackers and per-transaction gas fees.      From a technical standpoint, building private networks is entirely manageable. But very quickly, companies come to see the limitations and start thinking about migration to the public ecosystem. Once that happens, the trouble begins.      These delicate ecosystems, built in a safe, cozy world of design-by-committee with only nice people at the table, would be slaughtered if exposed to the real Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Even worse, over time, these sheltered ecosystems drift ever further from the public standards. Migrating these systems to the public Ethereum network would be so costly it would just be cheaper to rewrite and redo the whole thing.      There’s a better way: Instead of building a fully private blockchain, companies that cannot bring themselves to go all the way public from day one should look at building connected, permissioned sidechains to the Ethereum network. Though still permissioned, these connected side chains would be much more closely linked to the standards and tooling of the public Ethereum main network. They can and should use the same token and security standards as the public networks, even if all the participants are permissioned.      In this model, migrating to a public network would be a much faster and actually viable path forward with lower risk of stranded investment. And in the interim, as an integrated layer 2 sidechain, these permissioned systems could still have interactions with the liquidity and user base in the main network.      Blockchains offer some compelling advantages for a lot of enterprises and processes, and these advantages are worth braving the risks, provided companies have a careful road map toward the future. For some use cases, like product traceability, going directly to public blockchains is easy and low risk. There are no privacy concerns in many cases; the whole point is public transparency and accountability.      For more advanced business processes, such as procurement, the risks and the rewards are bigger. Smart contract-based procurement systems offer a future where companies can not only negotiate discounts and rebates, they can also be sure they actually get those incentives.      Putting procurement agreements on a blockchain means getting comfortable with the privacy and payment technology on-chain. Initiatives like the Baseline Protocol have gone a long way toward enabling privacy using zero-knowledge proofs and off-chain data storage. There’s no risk of exposing private data if it is never stored on-chain in the first place.    Read more: What Is an Enterprise Blockchain?    Building these products on permissioned side chains first will allow enterprise users to get comfortable with the challenges and issues, while staying close to the public Ethereum network. So, is it still necessary to go all the way to public? I think yes for a very simple reason – to access the full range of services available on public blockchains.      Nearly all permissioned systems suffer from a lack of supplier and partner diversity. It’s hard enough getting several companies to agree upon the rules. Now imagine trying to get your financial partners, insurance companies, logistics providers and others on the same page. It is not going to happen. Throwing the ecosystem open to the public infrastructure and adhering to open standards means it also isn’t necessary. More competition, more choice and more services immediately become available when networks open.      For all the same reasons that the open, public internet has become our dominant networking technology, public blockchains, most probably Ethereum, will take up a similar role in the economy. And private networks, a lot like corporate private intranets, will never go away, but they will become ever-less strategic to the ecosystem or the companies involved.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/09/why-enterprises-should-build-on-public-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d6f776df89a1cf4fe132385cd9dc7c5dcbf41471-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42397031,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYX4i,1628521188,Senate Advances Infrastructure Bill Without Amending Crypto Provision,"The U.S. Senate voted to advance a $1 trillion infrastructure bill without amending a provision that broadens cryptocurrency tax reporting requirements.      The provision seeks to enforce stronger information reporting rules for tax purposes on the crypto industry by ensuring that any brokers report transaction data to the Internal Revenue Service. However, it also broadens the definition of “broker” to the point where critics of the provision believe miners, node validators and even developers who create cryptocurrencies might qualify. Critics also argued the inability to comply with new tax regulations could make it difficult, if not impossible, for these kinds of businesses to operate in the U.S.      The Senate voted to advance the bill without any amendments late Sunday. The legislative body will debate the new base bill for 32 hours before voting to send it to the House. An amendment may be adopted through unanimous consent, but if a single Senator objects, the amendment would not be added.      Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said his team has ""been working hard to get a deal"" on Monday.      Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who inserted the provision in the infrastructure bill, said he does not believe the language could be interpreted that broadly, but said work could be done in floor remarks on Sunday.      ""We should work to clarify this ... we want to be sure miners and stakers and others, now or in the future, who play a key role by validating transactions or sellers of hardware or software for digital wallets, or node operators, or others who are not brokers, are clearly exempted,"" he said.      The Senate was originally set to vote on competing amendments that both looked to address this concern in different ways.      One amendment, introduced by Sens. Wyden, Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) last Wednesday, sought to specify that these types of businesses are exempt from the reporting requirement, meaning only trading desks or businesses which provide similar types of services would be required to comply with the broker reporting rules.      Another version, introduced by Sens. Portman, Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) sought to only exempt validators from proof-of-work or proof-of-stake networks (after revisions). The White House previously announced its support for this amendment.    $28 billion    The way the provision is currently worded, non-custodial businesses are part of the scoring, or how the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) evaluated the amount of revenue it could bring in. It’s possible that explicitly excluding miners, for example, could change the scoring, meaning the provision would no longer be expected to generate $28 billion. This concern was levied against the Wyden/Toomey/Lummis amendment.      Though the JCT published its overall score for the infrastructure bill, the way the JCT arrived at the $28 billion figure is currently unknown. A representative told CoinDesk that the group does not typically publish this type of methodology.      Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy group, launched a call-in campaign to drum up support for the Wyden/Toomey/Lummis amendment late Wednesday. A spokesperson said the general public had placed around 15,000 calls before Saturday.      Crypto businesses, lobbyist organizations and venture capital firms also pushed for the amendment in public statements and letters directed to different lawmakers.      Following the Senate vote, the infrastructure bill will move to the House of Representatives, which will not take it up before the fall.      There is bipartisan opposition to the crypto provision in the House, but it’s unclear whether the House will choose to strip out the tax provision or narrow its scope.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/08/09/senate-advances-infrastructure-bill-without-amending-crypto-provision,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c74add87154cb5e184259dc86f7aaf4b1583dcde-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If approved, the proposed digital currency bank would operate under the supervision of the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).      To be clear, this would be an industry first, with a scope far beyond the OCC banking charter already conditionally issued to Anchorage, Paxos and other crypto-native financial services firms.      ""We are embarking on this journey alongside the efforts of the top U.S. financial regulators, who through the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets are seeking to better manage the risks and opportunities posed by large-scale private-sector dollar digital currencies,"" Circle said in a blog post.      A Circle spokesperson was not able to immediately answer if any corresponding paperwork has been filed with the federal authorities listed in the announcement. The OCC has not received a charter application from Circle, agency spokesperson Stephanie Collins told CoinDesk via email.      ""It warrants research but we do not believe there is a full-reserve commercial bank in the U.S.,"" a Circle spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""We are seeking a full OCC national commercial bank charter. Our business plan does not include fractional reserve lending.""      There are currently $27.5 billion USDC in circulation.

The SEC found that Poloniex's trading platform facilitated the buying and selling of digital assets, some of which were investment contracts and therefore classified as securities, according to an announcement Monday.      Poloniex has agreed to pay a disgorgement of approximately $8.5 million, prejudgement interest of $400,000 and a civil penalty of $1.5 million, coming to $10.4 million in total.      SEC commissioner Hester Peirce noted in a public statement, however, that the settlement continues the agency’s “enforcement-centric approach to crypto” but doesn’t set forth a reasonable plan for how to regulate the industry. Peirce has previously been critical of the SEC's crypto-related actions for not specifying which digital assets should be considered securities.      Circle Financial, which owned Poloniex from February 2018 to November 2019, had previously set aside $10.4 million for a settlement offer to the SEC.      Poloniex had not registered as a national securities exchange, in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, the SEC said.      The agency determined that Poloniex qualified as an exchange by providing ""the non-discretionary means for trade orders to interact and execute through the combined use of the Poloniex website, an order book, and the Poloniex trading engine.""      Circle revealed in July that it had lost over $156 million on its $400 million purchase of Poloniex, which it spun off just 18 months later to a consortium of unidentified Asian investors.

In simple terms, the interoperability protocol will help crypto assets like tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and even price data, flow between blockchain networks that don’t usually talk to each other. Wormhole supports Terra, Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain at launch.      Wormhole opens a faster (and, developers claim, simpler) route for non-native assets to enter Solana’s bustling DeFi ecosystem. Projects like Serum, the decentralized exchange backed by FTX, could unlock added cross-chain liquidity through Wormhole, one source said.      Data can cross this “trustless bridge” in both directions, said Hendrik Hofstadt, the director of special projects at Jump Trading Group, a key backer of Solana-based DeFi data distribution network Pyth.

42376334,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AAs9,1628508256,Ether Erases Early Losses to Trade Above $3K,"Ether erased early losses along with bitcoin on Monday, but remains below the 2 1/2-month high of $3,188 reached over the weekend.      The native token of Ethereum's blockchain was trading 4% higher on the day near $3,135 at press time, having touches lows near $2,900 early today, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, was changing hands near $45,700, a 4.3% gain on the day.      Both cryptocurrencies gained ground in the days leading up to Ethereum's supposedly bullish London hard fork on Thursday. Ether led the charge, rising from $1,700 to $2,700 in preceding two weeks and then extended gains. That's an increase of more than 85% in less than three weeks. As such, the cryptocurrency looked ripe for a pullback and has faced selling pressure in the past 24 hours.      ""It's a temporary pullback, typical to a move seen after a notable bull run,"" Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of Equilibrium and EOSDT stablecoin told CoinDesk early today, when ether was trading in the red below $3,000.      Analysts remain optimistic about ether's long-term prospects. ""Ether could reach a new all-time high by the year-end and rally to $10,000 or more in the next 12 months,"" Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital, said, adding that fundamentals have never looked more bullish. Equilibrium's Melikhov is also a long-term bull.      The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 implemented as part of the London upgrade introduced a mechanism that burns a portion of fees paid to miners. So as demand for Ethereum increases, ether's supply will decrease, potentially putting upward pressure on its price.      The options market has seen ultra-bullish flows in the wake of the change, with one institution-focused, over-the-counter platform seeing a bull call spread at the $40,000 and $50,000 strike calls expiring in March 2022.      Chu, however, said there could be some bloodletting in the near term due to regulatory concerns. ""Ether may fall to $2,000 or below,"" Chu said. ""The regulatory crackdown on Binance has triggered fears that other exchanges may be in the line.""      Both Chu and Melikhov mentioned the U.S. infrastructure bill that targets crypto-tax reporting as a source of uncertainty for cryptocurrencies in general.      While the infrastructure bill was set to be voted on over the weekend, no outcome has been decided for the so-called Portman amendment that will potentially subject more crypto investors to higher taxes and punish proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols in favor of proof-of-work (PoW).      ""The amendment, while not yet passed, could have significant implications for PoS networks and set tax reporting compliance barriers that could arguably be insurmountable for many firms which operate in the decentralized finance space,"" Simon Peters, a market analyst at eToro, said in an email. ""Obligations to provide tax reporting would be essentially impossible on decentralized exchanges where customers are unidentifiable.""      ""It also appears to favor crypto assets such as bitcoin, which are reliant on PoW and would be exempt from such reporting under the amendment,"" Peters wrote. Ethereum's blockchain, which dominates the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, is switching to the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake mechanism.      Also read: What Crypto Analysts Are Saying About the Ethereum Hard Fork      Chu and Melikhov also mentioned the U.S. Federal Reserve potentially easing its quantitative-easing program as a major factor that could put downward pressure on crypto prices. The U.S. nonfarm payrolls, or monthly jobs, data beat estimates on Friday, reviving fears of an early Fed taper, or gradual scaling back of stimulus. While gold has taken a beating in the wake of the upbeat U.S. numbers, cryptocurrencies have remained relatively resilient.

42376340,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AAyR,1628488393,Bitcoin Cools on 3-Month High as Long-Term Moving Average Looms Large,"Bitcoin, the world's oldest crypto, reached its highest point in almost three months on Saturday before paring back some of the weekend's gains.      Prices have since cooled and are down around 1.5% on a 24-hour basis after reaching a top of $45,300, their highest point since May 18. As of press time, bitcoin is changing hands for around $43,430.      Datamish data shows bitcoin's push to higher price highs (HH) and higher price lows (HL) was precipitated by a short squeeze which saw 126 BTC short positions liquidated on Friday.      ""Perpetual funding rates have turned positive, meaning that the derivatives market is clearly positioned to the long side,"" Toby Chapple, head of trading at digital asset firm Zerocap, told CoinDesk via Telegram. ""This positioning is also supported by an expanding futures basis curve, showing that market sentiment is gradually building.""      Significant outflows from exchanges have also been accelerating, indicating a lack of short-term selling intent, according to the digital asset firm. Despite market concerns around the proposed crypto tax reporting provision in the U.S. infrastructure bill, institutional activity is once again on the rise.      ""This is reflected in the Grayscale premium reaching toward positive territory, albeit slowly,"" said Chapple, referring to the difference between the value of the assets held by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust against the market price of those holdings. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)      Indeed, on-chain data also suggests further signs of bullish activity. Wallet addresses with greater than 0.1 BTC are at their highest point in two months and have continued to rise since July 28, up to 3.19 million from June 14's 3.14 million, Glassnode data shows.      Whales, or large market participants holding between 100 and 10,000 BTC, continue to build long-term positioning which ""bodes well for the structure of the market,"" according to Zerocap.      Bitcoin's HH and HL bullish charting pattern tells of the risk-taking mood currently brewing in the market which has driven prices toward the 200-day moving average – a significant marker of bullish activity when prices are above and conversely bearish when below.      ""The 200-day moving average at approximately $45,000 has provided some resistance – a clean break here could lead to the next accelerated push higher,"" Chapple said.
