The statement comes on the heels of Economy and Finance Minister of France Bruno Le Maire’s condemnation of the cryptocurrency project. Citing the potential threat the stablecoin poses towards destabilizing national currencies, Le Maire said, “We cannot authorize the development of Libra on European soil.”  Switzerland has long been a hub of crypto-development. The country is home to over 700 blockchain companies, including the Geneva-based Libra Association, which governs the project.  Noting that Switzerland’s “rules and standards are non-negotiable,” Branson continued to say that Libra “is something which is being done transparently.”  He added:  “I am much more nervous about projects which develop in a dark corner in the financial system somewhere, spread themselves out through cyberspace and one day are too big to be stopped.”  Swiss flag image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/01/swiss-regulator-finma-wont-impede-libras-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc0aafc72e81a8b2b1ab3be086efffc9daafb34c-1500x862.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee, requested details of the DOJ's investigation into BTC-e, a defunct crypto exchange with the Russian roots, his office announced Tuesday. Vinnik, allegedly BTC-e's operator, was arrested in the summer 2017 at the request of U.S. law enforcement and is now imprisoned in Greece.  Kobayashi contacted the DOJ after it brought a $100 million civil lawsuit against Vinnik this summer alleging he operated an unregistered money service business and failed to prevent money laundering.  ""The Rehabilitation Trustee has contacted the U.S. Department of Justice through a U.S. law firm, and seeking further information,"" the trustee's office said in a statement.  The DOJ hadn't responded to CoinDesk's request for comment at press time.  'Russian recovery' pending  Mt. Gox  's creditors have become increasingly interested in BTC-e in recent months.  ZP Legal, a Russian law firm, claims it can recover up to 200,000 BTC from unnamed Russian nationals related to BTC-e and that it has already located some of the missing coins. Still, the creditors are hardly unified in wanting to work with ZP Legal, which wants a cut of the recovered BTC in return for its services. Kobayashi has yet to say if he wants to work with ZP on the ""Russian recovery.""  During a public meeting with the creditors Tuesday, the trustee remained non-committal, noting only that his team was contacted by ZP Legal and had requested further information about its offer. ZP's head Alexander Zheleznikov declined to comment for this article.  The meeting did reveal that two large claimants for Mt. Gox's remaining funds – Mt. Gox's parent company Tibanne Co. (led by the exchange's former CEO Mark Karpeles) and Mt. Gox's unsuccessful U.S. partner, CoinLab – have litigated claims previously denied by the trustee.  Tibanne asked for 82,507.7 BTC and $3.5 million (386 million Japanese yen) while CoinLab requested $15.7 billion (1,690 billion Japanese yen). The trustee approved the basis of the claims, but disputed the amounts demanded. The court hearing the case approved the trustee's assessment, and Tibanne has filed an appeal in the higher court, according to the trustee.  Kobayashi's team has burned through about $1.5 million (155 million Japanese yen) over the last six months and has now recovered a total of $644 million (69.4 billion Japanese yen) in previously lost funds.

42431047,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzNvh,1569951606,Sia Reaches $225K SEC Settlement Over $120K Unregistered Token Sale,"Boston-based Nebulous, makers of the Sia network for decentralized data storage, has settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over an unregistered securities offering and conversion scheme.  In a blog post Tuesday, the company announced the settlement without admitting fault. It will pay disgorgement of $120,000, prejudgment interest of $24,602 and a civil money penalty of $80,000. At the time of the 2014 token sale, Nebulous raised approximately $120,000.  The Sia settlement comes just a day after the announcement of Block.One's $24 million settlement with the SEC for the EOS maker's $4.1 billion securities sale.  As part of the Nebulous settlement, the company will not be required to register the Siacoin utility token as a security. Siacoins are used in the Sia ecosystem to buy and sell cloud storage space and pay revenues to Siafund investors.  The network is used by 323 hosts in 43 different countries to store file contracts representing more than 500 terabytes of data, according to Nebulous' legal representatives at Cooley LLP.  Nebulous COO Zach Herbert told CoinDesk:  “Though the penalty for our unregistered 2014 Siafunds offering is steep, we are excited that the SEC chose to take no action against Siacoins, and we believe this settlement validates our two-token model.""  The sale  The company’s two-token model was funded by the sale of Siastock in 2014, which the company advertised as supplying “a guaranteed income proportional to the value of storage being rented from the Sia network.”  Two days after this announcement, the company began selling Sianotes that would be convertible to stock upon launch of the Sia network. The offering took place through Bitcointalk.org, three months before the ethereum offering, with approximately 1,250 notes sold at an average price of $96.  According to the SEC, “Sianotes and, as contemplated, Siastock were securities.” The company failed to register the offering and never “took steps” to confirm Sianote buyers were qualified investors.  Nebulous wrote in a statement:  “During these earliest stages of development of blockchain technologies, the Nebulous team did not anticipate that the SEC might later deem Sianotes or any other blockchain assets to be securities.""  The SEC also inquired about the unregistered 2015 conversion of ""notes"" to ""stock."" Ahead of Sia’s platform launch, the company renamed Siastock to Siafunds, which the SEC also claims “were” a security.  The conversion began in April 2015, and by June the company exchanged approximately 1,189 Sianotes, held by approximately 46 investors, for Siafunds. According to the SEC, 61 notes went unaccounted for because Nebulous “did not know who owned them.”  ""Upon realizing Siafunds may be securities we conducted a proper Reg D offering in April 2018,"" Herbert said. In July, the company raised $3.5 million in a pre–Series A round led by Bain Capital Ventures.

42431041,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzNjh,1569949821,Crypto Token HBAR Is Tanking and Hedera Hashgraph Is Looking for a Fix,"In a little over two weeks, Hedera Hashgraph’s HBAR cryptocurrency has dipped from a high of $0.36 cents to around $0.03 as of press time. The blockchain-like network’s CEO now says he will re-evaluate the token’s economic model and potentially change HBAR’s distribution schedule to give the company time to reassess.  “We are thrilled with the technical performance of our platform,” Hedera Hashgraph wrote in an amendment that was shared in the network’s Telegram channel on Monday. “We also believe that there may be an opportunity to make improvements to Hedera’s coin model.”  CEO and co-founder Mance Harmon did note in a blog post last week that 2.2 million transactions had run over the network in its first week, with network usage around 3 or 4 transactions per second and transactions settling in around 2 to 3 seconds. Hedera refused to comment for this story, saying the company does not speculate on HBAR prices.  However, Hedera noted in its post that the startup is working with Harvard-trained economists from consulting firm Prysm Group to re-evaluate the HBAR economic model. The goal: To see if it “has the right incentives for developers to develop on the network.”  SAFT slowdown  In Hedera’s most recent proposal for amending the distribution model for simple agreements for future tokens (SAFT) participants, Hedera has suggested that the subsequent SAFT distributions be quarterly rather than monthly, meaning that SAFT 1 and 2 holders would get their next distribution on Dec. 22 rather than Oct. 22.  The proposal requires agreement between Hedera and “the people holding a majority of the purchase amount for that SAFT series.”  Harmon wrote in the proposal:  “Although we’re very pleased with the volume of early network activity, it may be premature to release the next distribution of SAFT 1 and SAFT 2 coins within a month of the last one … before we receive the results of the Prysm Group’s review. So, the objective of the third proposed amendment is to extend Hedera’s discretion to allow for quarterly coin releases.”  Hedera raised money for the project at a time when altcoins were riding a high speculative wave out of 2017, said Eric Wall, the former blockchain lead at Nasdaq-owned fintech vendor Cinnober.  While Hedera has put together a high-profile governing council – including IBM, Boeing, Deutsche Telekom, Tata, Nomura and bank tech vendor FIS – it has yet to demonstrate high-profile use cases for HBAR, Wall said. Now that HBAR is open for retail exchange, creating retail demand will be crucial for Hedera.  “As more HBAR are released, it will increase selling pressure on HBAR,” Wall said. “For the price to support sell pressure, something needs to attract investors and speculators in this market … because that supply is going to shock the system.”  Wall added that the drop in HBAR price looks somewhat like the initial launch of Zcash which surged to more than $2 million on its first day in October 2016 and fell below $50 in December. On the first day Zcash launched it went from roughly 3,300 BTC at the time to 48 BTC.  Altcoins overall have dropped by around 50 percent in the past year, according to the midcap Bitwise index, while HBAR has decreased around 75 percent since its last SAFT sale in August 2018 valued the coin at 12 cents. Hedera isn’t the only altcoin network that’s adjusting its model either. Stellar just recently decided to eliminate inflation from its protocol.  Finding alignment  It’s not unexpected for HBAR to be undervalued or overvalued while it’s going through a price discovery period, Wall added.  Hedera’s Governing Council has also created a growth committee to look over funds set aside for incentive programs to accelerate adoption, and Hedera is scheduling one-on-one calls with stakeholders to educate them on the company’s efforts.  “While the value of the network will be driven by the applications that developers continue to bring to market on top of it, we were responsible for the creation of both the network and the economic model to catalyze that development,” Harmon wrote, adding:  “If we find mistakes in either, it is our responsibility to fix them. We are committed to doing what it takes to make sure the model is properly aligned to foster widespread developer and user adoption of the platform, and to demonstrating that we deserve the trust you placed in us to get that right.”  Hashgraph participants shouldn’t read too much into randomness, said Steve Wilson, a principal analyst at emerging technologies advisory firm Constellation Research.  “I’m not excited about cryptocurrency movements, especially in the very early days,” Wilson told CoinDesk in an email. “These systems are highly non-linear and highly sensitive.

42431053,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzO3h,1569949205,South Korean Court Issues Landmark Decision on Crypto Exchange Hacking,"A Korean crypto exchange, Coinone, has been ordered to pay compensation for losses resulting from a hack of a customer account.  While seen as precedent-setting, the ruling from the Seoul Southern District Court on Sept. 27 found Coinone only partly responsible and ordered an award far less than the damages the plaintiff had sought.  According to an account of the case published in IT Chosun, the customer – identified only as Mr. A – joined the exchange in April 2017. As of November 2018, his holdings were valued at around 58 million won ($48,300). Most of the that was stolen on Dec. 23, and the customer was left with holdings valued at just 5,982 won.  Trades that led to the theft were conducted via an IP address in the Netherlands. The customer sued for 58 million won in losses, saying that the exchange should have blocked transactions from overseas and that it should have rejected any transfer request of more than 20 million won.  ""The exchange has not set minimum safeguards,"" the plaintiff argued, according to the newspaper.  Coinone, which according to CoinMarketCap data is the world's 70th largest exchange by reported volume, countered that it is not required to block foreign IP addresses. In terms of the 20 million won limit, it said that this threshold was only a government policy related to anti-money laundering and not a strict obligation to the customer.  The court agreed with most of what the exchange argued. It did not hold Coinone responsible for the hack itself, and it said that the exchange did not have to police transactions by IP address. It would only have to block an address if it knew beforehand that it was being used for illegal access to an account.  But the court did say that the transfer limits need to be followed, as the 20 million won cap was set not only to prevent money laundering but also to protect customers from exchange failures. The court also determined that it is reasonable for customers to expect the limits to be in place and enforced. The plaintiff was awarded 25 million won.  ""It is a mistake for the exchange to fail to meet the daily withdrawal limit,"" IT Chosun quoted the court as saying.  While the customer only received partial compensation, the Korean press reports that the award is a first and that the decision suggests that exchanges can now be held responsible for some losses.

Their new company, Global Currency Organization (GCO), developed the USD Digital (USDD) token. It aims to break through with exchanges, traders and OTC desks looking for a stablecoin product but unwilling to develop one themselves.  A novel fifty-fifty revenue sharing model incentivizes that adoption, GCO says, and USDD’s placement on the ethereum blockchain provides users with transparency.  “It’s the best of both worlds,” said CEO Joe Vellanikaran. “They get the stablecoin, and they get the revenue that GCO shares with them.”  Vellanikaran began working on stablecoins at TrustToken as a general manager for the San Francisco firm’s TrueUSD token – also pegged to the dollar.  He recognized the value stablecoins brought to institutional investors and individuals, especially in moving money across markets. Backing the tokens with USD brought more stability and trust.  “Let’s say you’re a Japanese student living in the U.S. and you want your parents to send you funds,"" Vellanikaran told CoinDesk. ""With the current process, you’d either need a U.S. bank account or be subjected to long delays and conversion fees. With our stablecoin, you should be able to receive your funds in a matter of” minutes.  Vellanikaran wants to expedite a worldwide adoption of blockchain-based currencies, which he said will come about “in the next 10 to 20 years.” But that global shift will only come with institutional support, he said.  “For a company to emerge and help move all these dollars to the blockchain, we really have to open it up to the partners” who want to use stablecoins, he said, adding:  ""That’s what we think we can do through revenue sharing.”  Stability image via Andrew Palmer / Unsplash",POSITIVE,USDD,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | USDD,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/01/jpmorgan-intel-alums-launch-revenue-sharing-stablecoin-usdd,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f15aa853e6a89e8076230ef79a4a2d3fbc522b65-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The goal is to help users easily execute advanced transactions through the company's decentralized finance (DeFi) portal.  In the early days of the internet, some of the most valuable properties were portals – websites that gathered information in one place. Now, in the early days of the decentralized web, InstaDApp wants to be a window into multiple DeFi services – one that makes it easy to move assets between them.  The round was led by Pantera Capital, with a slew of prominent investors including Naval Ravikant, Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase Ventures, IDEO Colab, Robot Ventures and Kyber Network's Loi Luu.  In an email to CoinDesk, InstaDApp co-founder Sowmay Jain said his company's decentralized app (dapp) is an interface to multiple protocols.  ""For InstaDApp, we focused on building up a layer that acts as the mediator between the user interface and underlying protocols,"" Jain said. ""This layer, consisting of our smart wallet, bridges contracts and reserve pools, [and] abstracts away lots of complexities.""  InstaDapp currently provides interfaces for Compound, Uniswap and MakerDAO. As of this writing, InstaDApp is the fourth-largest dapp in DeFi, according to DeFi Pulse, with $30.8 million worth of assets locked in its smart contracts (up from only $4.2 million in early July).  “InstaDApp is a very talented team out of India looking to make decentralized finance more accessible,"" Balaji Srinivasan, formerly of Coinbase and Earn.com, wrote in a blog post shared with CoinDesk prior to publication.  ""India is actually our second-biggest source traffic after America,"" despite the fact that the central bank has restricted financial institutions from facilitating crypto transactions, Sowmay wrote. ""The movement might be slowed down, but it cannot be stopped.""  Notably, InstaDApp's Jain is 21 years old; fellow co-founder Samyak Jain is 19. Nevertheless, they have pivoted their lives to crypto, writing in a blog post shared with CoinDesk that they have dropped out of school to ""become full-on 'native DeFi.'""  They wrote:  ""We realized that the traditional finance systems we were studying in school were slow to innovate, extremely restrictive, tightly controlled by financial giants and bound by geographical constraints.

42431049,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzNzh,1569938424,Ethereum Scaling Project SKALE Raises $17.1 Million for Mainnet Launch,"SKALE Network, a blockchain scalability platform, has raised $17.1 million to launch its mainnet. The firm says it could be ethereum's “best shot” to beat other smart contract platforms.  The investment consists of a $10 million contribution from SKALE Labs and $7 million in a recent financing, SKALE Labs CEO Jack O’Holleran told CoinDesk, noting the numbers are not final due to ongoing accounting adjustments and asset transfers.  Nineteen investors participated in the recent financing, including Arrington XRP Capital, Blockchange, ConsenSys Labs, Hashed, HashKey, Multicoin Capital, Recruit Holdings and Winklevoss Capital, bringing the total number of backers of the project to over 40, according to O’Holleran.  The contribution from the San Francisco-based SKALE Labs largely comes from its previous financing through a $10 million Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) sale including an $8.68 million funding round led by Multicoin Capital and $785,000 from earlier investors last year  ""Skale has grown tremendously over the past year in almost every aspect,"" Kyle Samani, managing partner of Multicoin Capital, told CoinDesk via email, adding:  ""There's a lot to like, and we've been impressed by their ability to set strategy, design spec, and execute. The product is also clearly hitting a nerve. I expect a majority of the smart contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem to eventually leverage Skale.""  The funding will be used to seed and stabilize SKALE's proof-of-stake network and increase its security, as well as adding more people to the 20-person engineering team, O’Holleran said.  After a token sale last October, SKALE Labs launched a testnet in late-2018 and established the NODE Foundation in April 2019. NODE is similar to the non-profit Ethereum Foundation in that both organizations promote the use of their respective networks.  Smart-contract competition  SKALE is the latest attempt at boosting the scalability of the ethereum blockchain.  The network says it will enable dapps to conduct “millions of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of what’s possible today,” according to a statement from SKALE Labs.  O’Holleran added in a statement:  “Helping Ethereum Dapp developers scale applications is the center of what we do.""  The network aims to help the developers by providing a Layer 2 platform with high speeds, fast finality and low costs, SKALE Labs said.  Gaming and decentralize finance (DeFi) applications are where SKALE hopes to move the needle, O’Holleran said.  “A lot of games not only want to have a blockchain to support payments within the system but also have NFTs [non-fungible tokens], the part of the game that lives on the blockchain,” he said.  Blockchain investors of late have seemed to be bullish on the gaming use-case.  In September, South African firm Naspers Ventures led a $15 million Series A funding round in Immutable Games, the maker of Gods Unchained.  Two months earlier, Initialized Capital, Coinbase Ventures and Polychain Capital invested $3.75 million in Horizon Games, a blockchain-based game studio with a Hearthstone competitor called Skyweaver.  O’Holleran said SKALE currently has 23 different dapps on the platform. The full list of gaming companies that partner with SKALE will be released at the beginning of November, he said.  Hashed, as one of the network’s major investors, was chosen for its strategic value in the South Korean gaming market, O’Holleran said, adding:  “I think the [Korean] market is really adopting compared to the rest of the world. I think it is going to be the first place we see significant traction.”  Ethereum and USD image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/01/ethereum-scaling-project-skale-raises-171-million-for-mainnet-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e309d8349031895b0c9c190938046f5834218d39-1500x897.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431050,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzO5h,1569935754,Stripe-Backed Payments Firm Raises $100 Million to Compete Against Stablecoins,"Stripe-backed digital payments platform Rapyd raised $100 million in a Series C funding round to face off against the arrival of stablecoins. The VCs behind the platform are pushing the pace with the funding round, after Rapyd raised a $40 million Series B in February.  General Catalyst and Tiger Global, which both backed $35 billion-valued Stripe, participated in the B and C rounds, with the Series C including Coatue and Entrée Capital and led by Oak HC/FT, a private equity fund with $1.9 billion AUM.  A spokesman said the raise brings Rapyd near “unicorn territory” but was unable to cite its specific valuation. The Series B round reportedly valued the Israeli company at $300 million.  In a statement, Arik Shtilman, Rapyd co-founder and CEO, said:  “As more than half of all transactions worldwide are facilitated via bank transfers and cash, merchants find it increasingly difficult to digitally enable local payment methods and process cross-border sales that are required for international expansion.”  A company spokesman, told CoinDesk:  “This is a major challenge for global expansion, as local consumers around the world are unable to transact with foreign retailers, and businesses can’t pay employees in key local markets. It may be hard to grasp from a US perspective but consider that Brazil has certain payment methods that work only within the country, and not beyond its borders. In India, consumers still use cash as the primary method of payment due to a lack of trust that goods or services will be delivered.”  The friction and national regulation are the barriers to entry to new direct competitors in the payments space, but also why stablecoins and other crypto solutions pose a threat.  Rapyd sells a global fintech-as-a-service platform with the ability to accept cash, bank transfers, e-wallets and local debit card payments in over 100 countries. Notably, it does not do crypto.  Direct competition is beginning with IBM working on the Stellar blockchain, where stablecoins can substitute any local fiat currencies to be processed in cross-border payments. Meanwhile, central banks and crypto exchanges pile onto Libra and plot their own stablecoins.  The legacy solution has been on-the-ground partnerships in emerging markets to connect domestic money transfer systems to global markets.  Doing so requires physical companies and interactions with regulators in all of its base markets plus partners everywhere else:  Rapyd is a trading name of its original brand CashDash UK Limited, regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.  In the U.S., Rapyd is registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and provides fintech banking services via Evolve Bank & Trust.  In the EU and in Mexico, it has an e-money license issued by the federal authorities.

As reported in the Moscow Times Tuesday, Denis Baykov was handed the penalty by a jurisdictional city court for accessing the lab’s supercomputer to illegally mine the world’s top cryptocurrency by market valuation.  Located in Sarov, Russia, the top-secret lab was where the first Soviet nuclear bombs were manufactured in the late 1940s. It remains home to some of Russia’s most powerful computers.  The mining trio was first exposed last February and promptly handed over to the Federal Security Service.  Using the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, bitcoin harnesses miners to record transactions and secure the the blockchain with powerful energy-intensive computers. Mining power is measured in hashes per second.  According to today's report, Baykov, along with the two other lab employees, used specially designed software to mask mining on the lab's computer, which can conduct transactions up to 1,000 trillion operations per second, or one petaflop. Hashes per second do not translate into operations per second, however.  With the price of bitcoin sitting around $8,000 per coin, one of the three employee's lawyers, Alexei Kovalyov, hinted at the fine being very small compared to the probable payoff:  “I can say one thing for sure: they were not detained on the first day they began to mine.”  Court verdicts for the other two scientists have not yet been reached.

The auction kicked off on Sept. 1 and was run by digital collectibles marketplace OpenSea, which disclosed the exploit Monday and published an update on the issue today.  Taking ""full responsibility"" for the bug, OpenSea said 17 names in total were taken by the hacker, including other notable ones such as defi.eth, wallet.eth, and pay.eth.  The bug in the auction software had distributed ENS domains to participants who did not hold the highest bid, according to the post.  Further, OpenSea stated:  ""One user discovered an input validation vulnerability that allowed them to place bids on a name that actually issued a different name.""  Further issues with the auction process affected some 30 domain names like bitmex.eth or hodls.eth, with bids incorrectly processed. None of these domains were involved in the exploit, however.  An alternative web standard to the internet domain service, DNS, ENS operates on the ethereum blockchain. Unlike DNS, domain names cannot be forcibly retrieved once allocated to a party, thanks to the immutability of the ledger the information is stored on.  OpenSea explained:  ""A blessing and a curse of blockchain-based digital assets is that once they have been distributed, it is impossible for them to be revoked. We can’t redo the auctions for the names that were sold in an invalid fashion.""  As such, the firm has asked for the domain names to be returned so they can be re-auctioned. A reward of 25 percent of the final auction price plus the original bid will be given to the hacker, the blog states.  Apple.eth and the 16 other hacked domains have been blacklisted by OpenSea. ENS is considering blacklisting the names as well.  ENS did not respond to questions from CoinDesk by press time.

42431059,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzOBh,1569927618,Bitcoin's $800 Price Recovery Runs Into Key Resistance,"View  Bitcoin’s bounce from Monday’s three-month low of $7,715 is struggling to beat the 200-day moving average resistance, currently at $8,440.  The recovery rally lacks volume support and could be short lived. A rising wedge breakdown seen on the hourly chart favors a drop to levels below $8,000.  A close above Monday’s high of $8,368 is needed to weaken bearish pressures. A bullish close, if confirmed, could yield a break above $9,000.      Bitcoin is better bid on the first day of the fourth quarter, but the relief rally is struggling to gather traction above a key former support-turned-resistance.  The top cryptocurrency is currently changing hands at $8,330 on Bitstamp, representing a 7 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Prices hit a high of $8,519 earlier today. At that level, the cryptocurrency was up $804 or 10.4 percent from the 3.5-month low of $7,715 reached in the Asian trading hours on Monday.  A recovery rally was expected, as the cryptocurrency was looking oversold on Monday, having dropped by more than $2,000 last week.  So far, however, a sustained break above the 200-day moving average (MA) resistance at $8,440 has remained elusive.  The 200-day MA is widely considered a barometer of the long-term trend. The cryptocurrency is said to be in a bull market if it is charting higher lows above the key MA, while lower lows below the long-term average is taken as a sign of bear market.  Further, the average line proved a tough nut to crack on Saturday, after which a fresh wave of selling ended up pushing prices to lows near $7,700.  Put simply, the 200-day MA is a crucial resistance, which if breached, may invite buying pressure.  Moreover, a convincing break above the 200-day MA would strengthen the narrative put forward by the likes of popular twitter analyst Crypto Bitlord that BTC may have bottomed out near $7,700.  While Crypto Bitlord is calling a bullish move to $9,000, market analyst Josh Rager is expecting consolidation.  The outlook would turn bullish above $8,800, according to Rager. That said, a convincing break above $8,800 may not happen immediately, as technical studies are still biased bearish and the rally seen in the last 24 hours is lacking substance.  4-hour and hourly charts  Bitcoin witnessed a double bottom breakout on the 4-hour chart in the Asian trading hours, opening doors for a rise to $8,900 (target as per the measured move method).  The breakout, however, lacked volume support. In fact, trading volumes have remained low throughout the price rise from $7,715 to $8,519. A low-volume recovery is often short-lived.  The hourly chart is reporting a rising wedge breakdown – a bearish reversal pattern that indicates the corrective rally has ended and prices could fall back below $8,000 in the next 24 hours.  The case for a rise to $8,900 would strengthen if a move above $8,500 is accompanied by a surge in buying volumes.  Daily chart  Bitcoin is currently struggling to beat the 200-day MA resistance.  The cryptocurrency created a bullish outside bar candle yesterday, signaling seller exhaustion.  A short-term bullish reversal would be confirmed if prices print a UTC close above $8,368 today, validating Monday’s outside bar candle. That could yield a sustained move to $9,000.  However, the outlook as per the longer duration technical charts will remain bearish as long as prices are held below $9,097, as discussed yesterday.

An SEC announcement on Monday indicated that the district court for the Southern District of New York entered a default judgment against Longfin, ordering the firm to repay $3,532,235 – all the proceeds raised in Longfin's 2017 Regulation A+ offering, plus interest. The company has also been fined $3,243,613.  The SEC claimed in June that Longfin and its CEO, Venkata S. Meenavalli, had falsely stated in an application to the SEC for the offering that the company was largely managed and operated in the U.S. when that was not actually the case.  They also gave away over 400,000 Longfin shares to ""insiders and affiliates,"" allowing them to fake the number of qualifying shareholders and shares sold in the offering to pass the threshold for listing on Nasdaq.  The SEC also claimed that Longfin and Meenavalli fabricated $66 million in revenue from ""sham"" commodities transaction – a sum that represented over 90 percent of the firm's total reported revenue for 2017.  The case is still ongoing, according to the regulator, as is a related criminal action brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey.  The SEC said it will set up a ""fair fund"" to refund ""harmed"" Longfin investors with the money returned by Longfin. The company voluntarily delisted from Nasdaq in May 2018 and shut down in November 2018.

According to U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York, Jon Barry Thompson of Volantis Market Maker is accused of committing two counts each of commodities and wire fraud for false claims concerning the acquisition and sale of $7 million worth of bitcoin.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission also leveled civil charges against Thompson on Monday.  In a complaint filed earlier this summer, a grand jury alleged that Thompson defrauded two companies out of funds intended for bitcoin purchases in 2018. At the time, bitcoin traded for just under $8,000 per coin, according to Statista.  Thompson is said to have told both firms that Volantis was filed as a limited liability company in the state of Delaware, although no record exists of its registration. Volantis operated mainly out of Pennsylvania, according to the complaint.  One of the fraudulent transactions is claimed to have occurred in June and July 2018, with ""Company-1"" giving Thompson $3 million to facilitate tranches of bitcoin purchases. As described in the complaint, Company-1 was an over-the-counter (OTC) trade desk.  The complaint states Thompson sent the funds to a third-party escrow service which never purchased the bitcoin promised or returned the funds. Thompson repeatedly lied to Company-1 on the state of the transaction and where the bitcoin resided, saying ""cash is with me, coin is with me.""  Thompson further claimed ""there is no risk of default"" since Volantis controlled ""both sides of the transaction.""  Company-1 neither received the bitcoin promised nor had its $3 million returned, according to Attorney’s Office.  A similar story had played out earlier that year, with ""Company-2,"" an Irish investment firm named Symphony. In March 2018, Thompson entered into a contract with Symphony as a facilitator in a $4 million bitcoin purchase. Thompson used an undisclosed third party to facilitate the transactions, to whom he gave the capital without receiving bitcoins in return.  As with Company-1, the deal with Symphony came to a close in July 2018 with Symphony out of pocket and having received no bitcoin.  Under the state of Pennsylvania’s current commodities and wire fraud laws, Thompson could face up to 60 years in prison for all four counts.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “As alleged, Jon Barry Thompson repeatedly lied to investors in cryptocurrencies about the safety of their investments made through his companies.

The Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU) worked with Wilsons Auctions to sell the digital assets, including bitcoin, ripple and ethereum, in what is said to be the unit’s first such auction.  ""Asset recovery in a digital world has evolved, so it's really important that, working alongside commercial partners, we have a clear process for the storage and sale of cryptocurrency,” detective chief inspector Martin Peters said in a statement.  The department hired an asset management and realization contractor to vet the bidders “to ensure that the assets are not able to make their way back into crime,” according to the statement.  Teen hacker  Police seized the funds from 19-year-old Elliott Gunton in 2018, following a routine check of his computer related to his sentence for hacking into the telecommunications giant TalkTalk, in 2015.  During the inspection, it was found that Gunton held stores of stolen personal information from EtherDelta customers, which he advertised for sale online for $3,000, paid in crypto. At the time, Gunton’s illicit holdings were valued at $337,000.  The auction comes days after Gutman was sentenced at Norwich Crown Court to 20 months in prison after pleading guilty to these crimes, which include conspiracy to commit computer and wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He was also ordered to repay approximately $509,000.  In the indictment, it’s shown that Gutman worked with U.S. national Anthony Nashatka to breach the exchange and ""withdraw cryptocurrency from hundreds"" of EtherDelta accounts. Throughout the conspiracy, the two operated under the aliases Planet and Psycho.  Crypto caper  The scheme took place over seven days in December 2017 and comprised several steps.  On Dec. 13, 2017, Nashatka purchased identifying information regarding an unnamed person in the indictment, “Z.C.,” thought to be Zachary Coburn, EtherDelta’s CEO. The following day, the two then rerouted Z.C.’s cellphone and email addresses to accounts under their control.  Using this information, Nashatka and Gunton gained unauthorized access to EtherDelta’s Cloudflare account, disabled the website and spun up a proxy site. Whenever an EtherDelta client logged in, their accounts, wallets and private keys were visible to the two defendants.  While the total number of victims and the amount of stolen funds remains unknown, one victim reportedly lost approximately $800,000.  For his role in the scheme, Nashatka faces a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and maximum fines up to $250,000. His federal court appearance is scheduled for Oct. 10 in San Francisco.  Gunton’s parents previously pleaded guilty to transferring criminal property for attempting to transfer cryptocurrencies out of a seized bitcoin wallet.

42431048,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzNxh,1569918602,This Crypto-Savvy Bank Is Building Bandwidth for Bitcoin Retail Payments,"The German bank partially owned by blockchain firms Nimiq, TokenPay and the Litecoin Foundation is planning to process cryptocurrency payments for retailers starting in 2020.  WEG Bank AG CEO Matthias von Hauff told CoinDesk the program is now accepting retailer applications for a sandbox test group, with applications opening to the public in early 2020.  “You don’t have to be a customer of the bank,” he said. “All we do is provide the regulatory framework in the background, to make sure when the retailer receives crypto, he actually receives fiat in his bank account, if he chooses.”  Since program partner Salamantex has already tested such point-of-sale devices in Austria, von Hauff said this new bank “stakeholder” will allow retailers to send crypto payments to their own wallets or cash out in fiat directly to a bank account. The program will be administered by WEG Bank AG’s new fintech brand, TEN31.  He added the program will start with bitcoin, litecoin and several other undisclosed crypto assets. Last week the bank offered NIM and TPAY to people who participated in a Twitter contest.  Speaking to broader plans for 2020 and beyond, von Hauff added:  “We will not limit ourselves to just point-of-sale terminals. We will do online checkout, ATMs and we are currently investigating the option to integrate a [crypto] exchange into the bank as well.”  It’s unclear which exchange the bank may be able to integrate with in the future, or how. The goal is to have the first OASIS test transactions working with WEG Bank AG and a non-custodial liquidity provider by end of 2019, according to Nimiq co-creator Elion Chin.  “What we envision with OASIS is that we are able to create a non-custodial connection between the blockchain world and the traditional bank or bank-account world,” Chin told CoinDesk.  As for other prospective DEXs, TokenPay also owns equity in the DEX startup eFIN.  “We are looking forward to working with WEG Bank to integrate eFIN, a cross-chain noncustodial DEX,” TokenPay CEO Derek Capo told CoinDesk.  Nimiq and TokenPay were both funded by initial coin offerings (ICOs). According to the Nimiq transparency report from September 2019, the project’s team spent roughly $3.5 million worth of the $12.8 million garnered during the 2017 ICO on 9.9 percent equity in WEG Bank AG. The other two crypto companies involved with the TEN31 project own the same amount of equity, although the Litecoin Foundation received its shares for free from TokenPay.  Regardless of the many brand names now involved, WEG Bank AG itself will be the regulated entity facilitating compliant services.  “This solution will make the on-boarding to get into crypto much smoother,” Nimiq’s Chin said, adding:  “My hope would be that this type of solution would make it smoother, faster, easier, to the point where my parents would get comfortable with it too.""

42431044,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzNnh,1569915056,Trading Volume for Bakkt's Bitcoin Futures Hit Just $5 Million in First Week,"The Intercontinental Exchange's highly anticipated bitcoin futures contract mustered just $5 million of total trading – and its daily product traded fewer than five contracts across its first week.  According to the exchange's Bakkt division, set up last year by the Atlanta-based company as a new marketplace for digital assets, some 623 monthly bitcoin futures contracts changed hands last week. Both the monthly and daily contracts debuted on Sept. 23.  Each of Bakkt's futures contracts represents one bitcoin, so the total trading volume works out to just over $5 million, based on the current price of $8,322.  By comparison, some 4,099 bitcoin futures contracts traded on Friday alone at rival Chicago-based exchange operator CME, whose market opened in 2017. And the CME's futures contracts represent five bitcoins, for a trading volume of $165 million on the single day.  Bakkt's daily futures contracts fared even more poorly, with fewer than five contracts trading throughout the first week.  Executives at Bakkt had touted the new contract as a milestone for the cryptocurrency industry, catering to big institutional investors that have thus far been slow to buy bitcoin and other digital assets.  According to the exchange, the new offering should appeal to institutional investors like hedge funds and other money managers because bitcoin must be delivered to fulfill the contract's terms when the maturity date arrives. That feature has been touted as a key advantage for asset owners who want to hedge their portfolios, in contrast with the CME's contract, which is settled via cash payments but has become popular with individual investors.  Dave Weisberger, CEO of CoinRoutes, a New York-based company that helps investors route cryptocurrency trades to various exchanges, says that bitcoin investors currently in the market already have plenty of places to buy and sell, but it's too early to write off Bakkt's new push, he said in a phone interview.  ""It takes time for people to move from one place to another, unless there’s a cost reason or a liquidity reason,"" Weisberger, a veteran of Wall Street firms Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, said in a telephone interview, adding:  ""These things tend to develop slowly.""  Damon Leavell, a spokesman for Intercontinental Exchange, said in an email that there was ""strong industry participation"" during the first week of the new bitcoin contract.  The contract maturing in October, he said, had the ""tightest bid-offer spreads in the market, which was an exciting achievement.""  Wall Street analysts look at the so-called bid-ask spread – the gap between what buyers are offering to pay and what sellers are offering to accept – as a gauge of how efficiently a market is operating.

With binary options, traders purchase an option contract to bet on whether the price of an underlying asset will either increase (""call option"") or decrease (""put option""). BitSwing works similarly, providing users with a BTC/USD spot price to bet against.  True to binary options' sometimes ""all-or-nothing"" epithet, if BitSwing traders are correct in their predictions they will double their staked ETH, or lose it all. The dapp has seen 300 unique users, putting it in top 15 active dapps according to dAppRadar’s stats.  The tool uses data oracles to provide real-time price feeds for the market. Information is sourced from CoinGecko, Binance and Upbit, among other sites. These data providers receive rewards for providing trustworthy information from users in the form of collateralized ""band"" tokens.  With BitSwing, there are two price queries for every transaction: one at the initial put or call to receive the starting price and one at the resolve for the final result. Each query currently costs 0.02 ETH so total of 0.04 ETH is being paid to data provider in every transaction. They are only paid per transaction.  Prior to going live, BitSwing garnered $12,000 in ETH from data query fees in its first two weeks. At that rate, “Band Protocol expects to generate over $300,000 in value per annum for its ecosystem via BitSwing alone,” the company said in a statement.  Founded in 2017, Band Protocol provides a platform for decentralized data governance on public blockchains such as ethereum, EOS and Cosmos. In February, venture capital firm Sequoia India led a $3 million seed round for the startup.
