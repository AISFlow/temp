42432832,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1mBh,1601845207,Crypto Long & Short: Coinbase's 'Apolitical' Stance Isn't Nearly as Simple as It Sounds,"As if the ructions of the year aren’t giving us enough cause to re-examine things we thought we understood, now we find ourselves questioning what a company is for, and what role it should occupy in society and in employees’ lives.      Earlier this week, Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong published a post in which he stressed the company’s focus on the mission of creating “an open financial system for the world,” and asked that political issues be left out of workplace discourse.      The questions this raises are huge, and the timing fits right into tectonic shifts already underway in the role of capitalism in our evolving society.      Let’s look at some of the questions, to which there are no clear answers.    Armstrong says Coinbase has “an apolitical culture.” What does that even mean, in these times of growing polarization on practically everything? Even being apolitical can be taken as a political stance. What’s more, when a company whose mission is to bring “economic freedom to people all over the world” requests that activism and politics be left at the door, you get a glimpse of how institutionalized the crypto ethos is becoming.  What is an employment contract? Some will answer that it is monetary compensation for certain output. Others will argue that you give up your time in exchange for payment. If the latter, can the organization paying you dictate what you do in that time?  Does a company have the right to define its own mission? The answer might seem like an obvious yes, but an extension of that is, does a company have the right to ignore topics its employees care about? Here the issue gets more divisive.  Related to the previous point, is a company’s responsibility to its shareholders or its employees? Armstrong believes that focus is core to achieving the mission, and that is what shareholders have a right to expect. But the success of intelligence-based businesses largely rests on the employees. We’re not talking about widget-producing factory floors here. This is an environment in which specialized talents and inspiration matter, and those are supplied by motivated people. So, some could argue that Armstrong’s responsibility is to his employees, because that will make the company more profitable and the shareholders happy.    There are many more, but I’m aware of pixel constraints.      As if to drive home the point, this week IBM released the results of its annual executive survey. Here’s an excerpt from the press release (my emphasis):    “Ongoing IBV [IBM’s Institute for Business Value] consumer research has shown that the expectations employees have of their employers have shifted amidst the pandemic – employees now expect that their employers will take an active role in supporting their physical and emotional health as well as the skills they need to work in new ways.”    This is at odds with a focus on the “mission,” whatever that mission may be. And it highlights the crucial role that employees play in a firm’s success. Also from the PR:    “Participating businesses are seeing more clearly the critical role people play in driving their ongoing transformation.”    This doesn’t come from some new-wave, millennial-driven, holistic social advocate. It comes from IBM, a standard bearer for legacy enterprise, and represents how much the concept of efficient management has changed.      Whether you agree or disagree with Armstrong’s position, you have to admit he was brave to wade into this, especially given the rumors of a planned public listing later this year.      Armstrong’s blog post is so much more than a corporate policy statement. It is likely to spark uncomfortable questions as employees seek clarification from companies struggling to navigate through issue-driven minefields. It could lead to a re-evaluation of the concept of a “social contract” between employer and employee, and whether the implicit understanding needs codifying. It could even end up being a trigger for a battle for the soul of corporations, and the meaning of value.      These are difficult times, in more ways than we can possibly realize. And the coming change in mores and expectations will be deeper than most anticipate.    BitMEX had a really bad day    The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal prosecutors have started the quarter off with a bang, charging crypto trading platform BitMEX with facilitating unregistered trading and other violations, and arresting co-founder Samuel Reed.      This is a big deal, as BitMEX is one of the industry’s largest trading platforms. In 2016, it introduced a derivative known as perpetual swaps (futures that don’t expire) to the market, with up to 100x leverage, and for many years was the market leader in terms of derivative volume and open interest.  This is an example of how market infrastructure can affect prices in a young asset class. In 2014, Mt. Gox – then the largest bitcoin (BTC) exchange with approximately 70% of market share – collapsed, revealed a gaping hole where custodied bitcoin should have been. The bitcoin price dropped by almost 50%, recovered a bit and then fell even further over the next few months. It took over two years to recover from the confidence blow.      As recently as a couple of years ago, BitMEX was the largest derivatives exchange, and this week’s news could have had a similar effect given the relatively high leverage in its contracts. Yet, the BTC price initially fell almost 4% on the news, which is not insignificant, but nowhere near the systemic jolt many expected. It then recovered 1.5% before being blindsided by other market-shaking non-crypto-related news.      In other words, BitMEX’s run-in with the law will have an impact, but it is unlikely to be material.      In recent months, BitMEX lost its dominant position to OKEx, Huobi and Binance, and now ranks fourth in terms of daily volume and second in terms of open interest. Even if BitMEX ends up closing, the market repercussions will be felt, but will not be systemically damaging, as there are alternative trading venues.      What’s more, while the domain name could be seized and withdrawals impeded (the exchange requires three of the four authorized signatories to approve withdrawals, and so far one has been arrested), BitMEX is unlikely to close – at time of writing, withdrawals were proceeding without hitch, and were significant but not catastrophic for the exchange.      Even more important, this news does not change the fundamentals of bitcoin. It may affect trading volumes as positions are closed and reopened elsewhere. But the underlying technology and the potential use case remain intact.      And, rather than weaken confidence in crypto market infrastructure, this news is likely to enhance it. One of the reasons cited by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its rejection of all bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals so far is the lack of surveillance on significant offshore exchanges. This action by the CFTC feels like part of a “bring out the broom” initiative that will improve the rigor and oversight of market players, which should boost institutional confidence and product range. It could even be a tentative step towards a bitcoin ETF approval.    3 things from Q3    As we are now into the final stretch of what has been a spectacularly tumultuous year, it’s time to look back at a few of the recent developments in crypto asset markets that I find particularly interesting. There are so many to choose from, as the speed of progress has been astonishing. Our CoinDesk Quarterly Review 2020 Q3, which dives into some of the main market drivers, is out on Monday – keep an eye out for it in our Research Hub.      1) Stablecoins were the breakout protagonist in terms of market activity, and not just in terms of market cap growth.  Earlier in Q3 the on-chain transfer value of fiat-backed stablecoins passed that of bitcoin for the first time. While there are many factors at play here, this does indicate a growing reliance on stablecoins as the industry’s settlement token.      2) The value that has flowed into decentralized finance (DeFi) applications has astounded even those of us who work in the industry. I don’t talk much about DeFi in this newsletter, since it has so far been very niche and, well, untested. But it's starting to affect the markets I do focus on.  While volumes have exploded (not literally, obviously, and it says a lot about the mood this year that I even have to clarify that), they are still small in terms of comparative market size. What is telling is the interest that centralized platforms such as crypto exchanges are starting to pay this area. And not just centralized platforms: At an event earlier this week, Brian Brooks, acting head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), said he believes traditional financial institutions will have embraced DeFi technology and principles within 10 years. I agree, and given the increasingly frequent signs this process is starting you’ll probably start to hear more about DeFi in these columns.      Perhaps you have already been following the DeFi space, because you are interested in unusual yield opportunities, or because you enjoy the wacky packaging some of these applications come in (many of which are named after food, don’t ask). If not, and you’d like to start to get ahead of the curve, here’s a good introduction.      3) Bitcoin’s dominance of the crypto asset market has continued its decline. Five years ago, bitcoin was virtually all of the crypto asset market. Then came the 2017 initial coin offering boom with a flood of new tokens surging in value, and bitcoin’s dominance fell to a low of 36%. As the bubble burst, most of the new tokens fell in value, eventually restoring bitcoin’s dominance to around 70%.      The dominance (as measured by TradingView’s BTC Dominance Index) has been steadily falling since around May of this year, largely due to the surge in the market cap of stablecoins and to the growth in DeFi tokens, not all of which were spurious memes.      Note that the index is trending downwards in spite of the upward trend in prices, which speaks to the level of growth elsewhere in crypto markets.      In other words, this is less to do with weakness in bitcoin and more to do with the expansion of the industry overall. That, in turn, is positive for bitcoin which, for many, will be the gateway crypto asset, the one that investors try out first.    Anyone know what's going on yet?    Bitcoin yet again exhibited its split personality this week. I had a chart all ready to share with you that showed that its correlation to gold had been heading up for most of the quarter – and then Trump’s positive COVID-19 test results sent gold higher while bitcoin headed lower. True, bitcoin had already had a shock earlier that day from the BitMEX indictment, and the slump could well have been continuing jitters from that. But it’s not unreasonable to expect market-shaking news like the President of the United States possibly being seriously ill (as far as we know, he only has light symptoms so far) to spark a rush to safety. It seems that the market is not yet convinced that bitcoin is a “safe haven” like its analog comparison.  Trump’s COVID-19 test result seemed to have more of an impact on markets than Tuesday night’s debate, which says a lot about the debate's inefficacy in moving the needle on divided allegiances. Zooming out, this is bewildering considering what its viciousness said about American democracy, and the importance of the election outcome. Unless, of course, the outcome of the election isn’t important at all? Like I said, bewildering.      Bitcoin had a weak September (-8.4%) and has not exactly started off on a good foot in October. It did, however, achieve a positive record: it has closed above the $10,000 mark for its longest streak of 66 days and counting. This is significant inasmuch as this long a stretch above that psychological barrier hints that $10,000 has become the new price floor. Of course, floors have been broken before …    CHAIN LINKS    Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex has started trading perpetual contracts that track two European equity market indices and settle in the stablecoin tether. TAKEAWAY: You’ve often heard me talk about how I believe crypto assets will have a profound impact on traditional capital markets. Here is an example of how it will happen: We have a crypto exchange offering a derivative developed for the crypto markets to bet on movements in traditional indices. And to top it all off, it settles, not in fiat but in a fiat-backed stablecoin. Another notable aspect is the leverage – 100x is insanely risky, and is a feature largely limited to crypto exchanges. Few traders avail themselves of that much risk, however, as experienced market professionals know that it’s not wise.      The spread between the six-month implied volatility (IV) for ether (ETH) and bitcoin, a measure of expected relative volatility between the two, fell to a 2.5-month low of 4% over the weekend, according to data source Skew. TAKEAWAY: This could mean that traders expect ETH to act more like BTC going forward. The ETH futures market is still immature, however, and the signals are not yet that reliable.      Arjun Balaji of Paradigm wrote an excellent overview of crypto asset market progress over the past two years, with a look at what needs to happen next: principally, major improvements in capital efficiency (which is gearing up with the emergence of institutional-grade prime brokerage and crypto-native repo, among other features), and the convergence of decentralized and centralized financial functions. TAKEAWAY: I totally agree, and hats off to Arjun for putting it all so succinctly. I have two needed developments to add: greater regulatory clarity on what is and isn’t a security, to encourage innovation in investment and saving opportunities for a broader range of people; and new rules to smooth the way for the new types of securities to list and trade in a compliant manner (the INX token is a start, but it’s just scratching the surface).  On a similar theme, Jill Carlson wrote an op-ed for CoinDesk that talks about how recent focus has been on innovation in crypto asset infrastructure, and how the pendulum may soon swing back to emphasize innovation in assets. TAKEAWAY: Robust infrastructure is essential for a thriving market that can attract significant levels of investor interest. But investors don’t enter our industry for the infrastructure, they do so for the assets. The pendulum that Jill refers to seems to have already begun its swing – we can see this not so much in the meme-infused DeFi assets, but more in the SEC-registered INX token that gives holders trading advantages and a share in net cash flow, and in SEC Chairman Clayton confirming that the U.S. regulator would consider authorizing a tokenized ETF (one presumably not based on crypto assets, for now).      An amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week showed that Bitwise’s Bitcoin Fundhas raised just under $8.9 million, more than double the amount it had raised last year. TAKEAWAY: According to Bitwise’s head of research, Matthew Hougan, this is largely because of growing concern over runaway inflation. Given the new Federal Reserve policy of allowing inflation to overshoot targets (the European Central Bank this week hinted it will follow suit), these concerns are likely to intensify.      The Atari Group, the company behind such classic video games as Pac-Man and Pong, will begin publicly selling its Atari Token (ATRI) cryptocurrency in early November. TAKEAWAY: This ERC-20 token will be used in crypto casinos, blockchain-based games and the company’s video game distribution platform. I’m not clear on the economics behind the token, but the combination of Atari, games and tokens does sound a bit like a door to a mainstream use case. But I’m not a gamer, so I might be wrong. (Speaking of which, anyone see the Netflix documentary series “High Score”? Excellent.)      Nasdaq-listed mining equipment manufacturer Ebang reported a revenue slump in 2020 H1 of over 50% from the same period in 2019. According to the company, this was largely due to pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. TAKEAWAY: Supply disruptions are no doubt part of it, but as my colleague Matt Yamamoto pointed out in this report, Ebang’s product mix was inferior to that of its competitors anyway. You can’t blame COVID-19 for everything.      CoinDesk Research has a new report out, authored by my colleague Matt Yamamoto, on Silvergate Bank, which looks at its financials and its business strategy in the light of growing competition.

42432859,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1m1h,1601838000,Confessions of a Sharding Skeptic,"With final preparations for the launch of Ethereum 2.0 soon to be underway, CoinDesk's Christine Kim spoke to Cayman Nava, technical lead at ChainSafe Systems and Alexey Akhunov, an independent researcher and software developer about the kinks in ETH's evolution that still need to be worked out.      For free, early access to new episodes of this and other CoinDesk podcasts subscribe to CoinDesk Reports with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, iHeartRadio or RSS.      This episode is sponsored by Crypto.com, Nexo.io and Elliptic.co.      The Ethereum blockchain processes about three to four times as many transactions as Bitcoin. It’s still not enough, however, to meet rising user demand for the cryptocurrency and prevent network congestion.      See also: DeFi Frenzy Drives Ethereum Transaction Fees to All-Time Highs      One of the most highly anticipated fixes to Ethereum’s transaction bottleneck and its lack of scalability is an ambitious software upgrade called Ethereum 2.0. According to Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, Ethereum 2.0 will boost network speeds from around 15 transactions per second (TPS) to 100,000 TPS.      How? The solution is sharding. Cayman Nava, technical lead at ChainSafe Systems, explains sharding as “a natural way to break things up.”      “If you’re wanting to process a lot of data but you don’t want any one party to be overloaded with that data, you can naturally think of breaking up your problem into smaller pieces,” said Nava. These “smaller pieces” Nava is referring to are called shards. In Ethereum 2.0, 64 shards will be created to break up the transaction load of Ethereum.      See also: Ethereum 2.0: How It Works and Why It Matters      While sharding sounds effective in theory, there are other Ethereum developers who are skeptical about the benefits of this technique in practice.      “If I were to design scaling [for Ethereum], first I would squeeze as much as possible out of Ethereum 1, which I think hasn’t been done yet, and then after that I would actually introduce sharding logically in order to see whether users would actually be able to use [sharding] effectively,” said Alexey Akhunov, an independent researcher and software developer for Ethereum that has been contributing code to the network’s development since 2016.      Sharding logically refers to breaking up data within the same blockchain as opposed to sharding physically, which necessitates the creation of multiple mini-blockchains. As mentioned, Ethereum 2.0 will spawn a physically sharded system of 64 linked databases. Optimizing the communication between shards in this environment, Akhunov goes on to explain, may pose an even greater challenge to network scalability than a transaction bottleneck.      Nava agrees there are kinks and holes in the design of Ethereum 2.0 and its sharded system that need to be worked out. But in Nava’s view, these problems that call for further detailing and research can be delayed in the short term while developers work toward an upgrade launch.      “I think we can delay these harder problems like how sharding should work or what it should look like. That can be pushed off a little bit so we can think about it and get it right. In the near term, we can get a lot of the benefits from the [Ethereum 2.0] work that we’ve been doing,” said Nava.

42432818,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1lhh,1601826066,CEXs vs. DEXs: The Future Battle Lines,"Since the formal introduction of Ethereum in 2014, the network has exploded with products that allow users to transact directly with one another, without relying on a third party.      One of the most common use cases is that of a decentralized exchange (DEX), an idea that dates back to Vitalik Buterin’s unveiling of Ethereum in 2014. Examining the history of how DEXs have evolved can help elucidate where DEXs are headed and how they will compete with centralized exchanges.    What’s in a DEX?    DEXs come in a variety of forms, but share one common quality: non-custodial. DEXs use smart contracts to manage funds on-chain, so users never have to trust a third party with their money.      However, the exchange part of a DEX – the way buyers and sellers find each other – can vary widely from one implementation to another. When thinking about the future of DEXs, it’s helpful to first understand their past.    Alex Wearn is the co-founder and CEO of IDEX, a high-performance DEX. He has spent his career in software development, including time at Amazon, Adobe, and IBM. He has been hacking on crypto startups since 2014, transitioning to full time with the launch of IDEX in 2018.    The earliest Ethereum DEXs, like EtherEx and OasisDex, built a traditional central limit order book (CLOB) exchange entirely out of Ethereum smart contracts. Developers and users quickly discovered that order management and trade execution are not well suited for a blockchain. In particular, the placing and cancelling of orders by market makers, and the interaction of traders with the on-chain order book, were expensive and error prone due to the high costs and latency of on-chain transactions.    Off-chain order books    In mid-2016, a new exchange, EtherDelta, innovated on this model by bringing the order book off-chain. This design eliminated the cost of order creation and reduced the latency and gas costs of placing an order.      While it was a major improvement, users still incurred costs for canceling orders – a fee which prohibited market makers from providing liquidity at scale. Additionally, takers submitted their own trades to the network, creating on-chain “trade collisions,” with multiple takers competing for the same order. On peak days, up to 30% of trades failed due to these on-chain collisions.      Although the first iterations of DEXs faded over time, they were innovative, forward-thinking, and laid the groundwork for models in use today.    Off-chain execution, on-chain settlement    Improving upon the earliest DEX models, the next generation of DEXs, including IDEX and DDEX, explored a hybrid approach. This design moved both order books and trade execution off-chain. With off-chain execution, users match their own orders but submit them to the exchange, which executes the trade and relays the order to the network for settlement. This approach eliminates the issues of on-chain trade collisions, gas fees for canceled orders, and front-running. This model served as the dominant trading model for almost two years.      However, this design is not without flaws. Without a matching engine, trade execution suffers, and gas settlement costs and network congestion remain problematic. Identifying these drawbacks hints at even more user-friendly DEX models in the near future.      While this design was garnering the most users and volume, a novel DEX model in Uniswap and Automated Market Makers (AMMs) joined the fray.    The rise of automated market makers    The AMM design is a creative response to the limits of hosting an order book on-chain. As we’ve discussed, many of the early CLOB DEXs struggled due to the fact that it’s both expensive and slow for users to update their orders using a blockchain.      Uniswap responded by removing the order book altogether, replacing it with a simple on-chain formula.      This architecture ultimately allowed Uniswap to achieve phenomenal growth. The “always on,” permissionless liquidity made it a great solution for other applications to build on top of. The fully-decentralized architecture has led to a resurgence of ICOs in the form of Uniswap direct listings, as projects can easily deploy their own liquidity pool to jumpstart trading of a new asset. The liquidity pool structure also makes it easy for non-technical users to commit capital and earn a passive reward from trade fees and liquidity mining.      See also: What Is DeFi?      In spite of these numerous benefits, experts speculate that AMMs in their current form are a mere stepping stone in the path of DEX design, and many question their long-term viability. As a rule, these products provide a less flexible version of market making than their centralized counterparts, and will lag in markets that require sophisticated analytics and human intervention.      Despite the many advantages of the Ethereum network, it’s clear that the traditional CLOB exchange doesn’t work well when operating on a decentralized network with such high latency and low throughput. As a result, DEX development will primarily continue down three paths: new types of AMMs, CLOBs on faster chains, and upgraded hybridized models.    New AMM models    AMMs have played an important role in DEX development, addressing key performance issues by removing the order book altogether and pricing assets using a static, on-chain function. Uniswap deployed the first example of these, the constant product function, which creates a specific type of pricing curve. Competitors like Curve have experimented with different functions, in this case choosing one that is better suited for assets where the market expects the price to be equal, such as stablecoins, or different types of wrapped bitcoin.      As these products evolve and address more specific use cases, they will likely be in demand given their on-chain availability and ease of liquidity provision. However, it is unlikely that they supplant CLOBs as the dominant form of trading, as fundamentally they are a less flexible form of exchange than CLOB.    It’s been several years since the first iteration of a crypto exchange, but systemic issues remain, creating multi-million-dollar problems for traders.    Instead of adapting to the network’s constraints, new projects like Serum are attempting to move to a different network where the constraints aren’t as severe. By using a more performant underlying network, one with higher throughput and faster consensus times, the team hopes to eliminate the UX issues that plague V1 order book DEXs.      However, at its core, trade matching and execution is a problem of consensus to determine who came first, which trades should to execute and in which order. A decentralized network, which by design has to come to consensus across a number of different nodes, can never compete at the same level of their centralized counterparts.      Hybridized models, like IDEX 2.0, aim to combine the power and performance of a centralized exchange, with the security of decentralized custody and settlement. By pairing the high-performance trading engine of a centralized exchange with the on-chain custody of a DEX, users can get the same trading experience they know and love without having to put their funds at risk.      See also: KuCoin CEO Says Suspects in $281M Hack Identified; Authorities on the Case      DEXs have come a long way. From clunky on-chain approaches in the earliest days of 2014 to today’s wide variety of options, each evolution in DEXs has come closer to delivering a product capable of both performance and security. Regardless of what flavor they come in, the future will see DEXs challenge centralized exchanges by finally separating the custody from the exchange altogether.      It’s been several years since the first iteration of crypto exchange, but systemic issues remain, creating multi-million-dollar problems for traders. Just this week, a hacker drained Kucoin of approximately $150 million in crypto assets. That was closely followed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) issuing a number of criminal charges against BitMEX for AML and KYC negligence.      All these issues stand as a backdrop to the ongoing battle between CEX and DEX environments. Regulatory and security concerns punctuate the growing need for traders to maintain custody of their assets and comply with regulators. Where CEXs often provide convenience for traders, they often come with security/seizure risk. DEXs, while more absolute in terms of asset control and security, offer little in terms of regulatory oversight.",NEUTRAL,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Alex Wearn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/04/cexs-vs-dexs-the-future-battle-lines,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c168a823abe3950a74af44b9dc482e315d74083-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
