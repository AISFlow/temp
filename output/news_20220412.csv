42395557,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxtCw,1649802845,First Mover Asia: Recycling Bad Actors in Crypto; Bitcoin Holds Below $40K,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin's price stabilized Tuesday – in contrast to U.S. stocks – after the U.S. Consumer Price Index rose to 8.5% in March, taking the key inflation rate to a fresh four-decade high.  Insights: It's not uncommon for perceived bad actors in crypto to get banished, only to reappear later in a different role, CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds reports.  Technician's take: Selling pressure could fade over the next few days.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $39,651 +0.5%  Ether (ETH): $3,008 +1.2%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Filecoin FIL +2.3% Computing Polygon MATIC +1.4% Smart Contract Platform Algorand ALGO +0.9% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Polkadot DOT −0.8% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin BTC −0.7% Currency Ethereum Classic ETC −0.7% Smart Contract Platform  Bitcoin's slide pauses after break below $40K  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is holding its own as oil prices jump back above $100 a barrel, rekindling inflationary concerns among traditional investors.  The U.S. trading action on Tuesday started off with the monthly U.S. Consumer Price Index report showing that inflation accelerated to 8.5% in March, a fresh four-decade high. The data point assuaged analysts' concerns that prices might be spiraling out of control, and stocks rose; some economists said inflation might be nearing a peak. Later in the session, rising oil prices appeared to dent the optimism, and stocks ended the day lower.  But as of press time, bitcoin was up slightly, changing hands around $39,600.  The strength was surprising because bitcoin had been down for two straight days, dipping below $40,000 earlier in the week for the first time since mid-March. Bitcoin is seen by some investors as a hedge against inflation, but lately price movements for the 13-year-old cryptocurrency have been increasingly correlated with U.S. stocks.  ""A large amount of institutional money that became crypto investors got their start in 2021, and they bought bitcoin between the $30,000 and $40,000 range, which could suggest they may want to buy this dip if they still believe in the long-term outlook,"" Edward Moya, a senior analyst for the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Tuesday in an email.  CoinDesk markets analyst Damanick Dantes noted in Tuesday's Market Wrap column that the bitcoin market is looking surprisingly calm at the moment, given the price plunge earlier in the week.  Even so, traders were looking for news from Shanghai, where a surge in COVID-19 cases has led to lockdowns – and speculating on what the potential economic impact might be.  A big gainer in crypto markets on Tuesday was SHIB, the Shiba Inu-themed meme token inspired by dogecoin (DOGE). The SHIB price surged after the trading platform Robinhood listed the asset – months after speculation surfaced that such a move was in the offing.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,397 -0.3%  DJIA: 34,220 -0.3%  Nasdaq: 13,371 -0.3%  Gold: $1,970, 1.1%  Insights  Gem.xyz’s Neso mess not yet an argument for doxxing DeFi  Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Gem.xyz had to unceremoniously oust a developer credited as a co-founder because of allegations that have emerged over past inappropriate behavior and sexual improprieties.  Neso, the person at the center of the controversy, is gone from the team’s roster. The Gem.xyz team maintains that he was an anonymous developer, not a shareholder, and there’s not yet evidence that would withstand court scrutiny to suggest that he’s anyone else.  Whatever work the person behind ""Neso"" has done to build up the reputation and respect behind the name is now gone. Neso might return under a new pseudonym to try and rebuild and start over. Perhaps, Neso was just that – a fresh start after a prior identity had to be abandoned.  Despite not knowing who Neso is in real life, the corrective measures still worked. They were still found out and ousted from the team, their name now labeled as persona non grata.  Although bad actors might change their nom de web, they always seem to be discovered. Michael Patryn, a serial scammer who was a co-founder of failed Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, was identified as Sifu, because of the due diligence work of Anon. The corrective measures worked, though Wonderland founder Daniele Sestagalli maintains that while as Sifu, Patryn had done nothing wrong.  If Neso reappears once again, he will be found out and whatever project he’s associated with will need to go through the trouble of distancing itself from him.  Like Neso and Sifu, Mt. Gox’s Mark Karpeles wants a fresh start, in his case with UnGox, a rating agency for crypto. Karpeles – who is against the DeFi culture of anonymity pseudonyms provide – maintains that he’s the man for the job because everything bad that could have happened in the crypto world has happened to him.  But Karpeles is up against a legion of critics. ""Imagine trusting Mt. Gox’s Karpeles with anything, especially with crypto ratings"" is the consensus on Crypto Twitter.  Ironically, if Karpeles chose to start the new venture under a pseudonym he could let his track record do the work. Not his name. It might be that Karpeles is the guy to rate crypto projects, but with a name like his attached to it his new venture has already been convicted in the court of public opinion.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Attempting to Stabilize Around $40K; Resistance at $43K-$47K  Bitcoin (BTC) returned to above $40,000 on Tuesday as buyers reacted to short-term oversold signals. The cryptocurrency could face additional price swings within its two-month-long range of between $37,500 support and $47,000 resistance.  BTC is down by about 12% over the past week, although technical indicators suggest the pullback could stabilize over the next few days.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is near oversold levels, which means buyers could remain active heading into the Asia trading day. Further, positive momentum signals on the weekly chart suggests pullbacks will remain brief this month.  Stronger resistance is seen at $50,966, which could limit an upswing in price.

One possible early sign came from the monthly change in the core index. It rose 0.3% in March from the prior month, the slowest pace in six months, driven by a 3.8% decline in used vehicle prices. Another encouraging sign was that airline fares, hotel prices and other more volatile categories drove much of the price gains for services, while pressure from categories such as housing, which tend to be more persistent, eased,"" said Blerina Uruci, U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price Group . (The Wall Street Journal) ... ""March’s data may represent a high-water mark for inflation, some economists have said. Overall price increases could begin abating in the coming months in part because gasoline prices have come down somewhat – a gallon cost $4.10 on Tuesday, according to AAA. Researchers have been expecting consumers to stop buying so many goods, like cars and appliances, potentially taking pressure off overburdened supply chains and allowing prices for those products to moderate.""

If buyers add to their longs, XTZ may expand to $4—or better. Past Performance The Tezos coin is pulling back from crucial reaction points after double-digit draw-downs on April 11. Currently, the XTZ price is up roughly five percent against the USDT and BTC. However, it is still down 18 percent in the past week of trading. Notably, Tezos is bouncing from the support (previous resistance) trend line at around March 2022 lows. Tezos Technical Analysis As per the XTZ candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, it appears that the sharp losses of April 11 were climatic, signaling the end of the bear push. The retracement of April 11 wiped out gains made in the last weeks of Q1 2022. At spot rates, there is a bullish engulfing pattern printing out from around March 2022 lows of around $3. Based on this, aggressive traders may load the dip with tight stops at April 12 lows. Any drop below $3 invalidates the bullish outlook. Conversely, if buyers add to their longs, XTZ may spring back to $4 in the medium term. What to Expect from Tezos? Tezos is in a precarious position, bouncing back after sharp losses. As per the XTZ candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, unexpected dumps below $3 cancels the bullish outlook. This move would possibly push the coin towards June 2021 lows of $2.1—or worse.The post Tezos Defying Gravity, XTZ adds 4% from March 2...",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT | XTZ,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | XTZ,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/tezos-defying-gravity-xtz-adds-4-from-march-2022-lows/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=tezos-defying-gravity-xtz-adds-4-from-march-2022-lows,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42422833,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qLrh,1649795053,Stepn Runners Undeterred by ‘Move-to-Earn’ Game’s Pricey NFT,"While the play-to-earn (P2E) industry has been under scrutiny after the $620 million Ronin hack, another type GameFi is gaining momentum.  Solana-based move-to-earn project Stepn by Find Satoshi Lab earned $26 million in the first quarter. Move-to-earn, similar to play-to-earn, is a model where users are rewarded in cryptocurrency for their step count.  “As of mid-March, we had 100,000 daily active users, and that number has doubled since,” Chief Business Officer Shiti Manghani, who touted the site’s 1 million downloads, told CoinDesk in an interview.  While other P2E games incentivize online gaming, Stepn is emerging as an early example of GameFi that empowers users to pursue fitness and wellness. Users who buy the game’s non-fungible token (NFT) can earn rewards for every step they take.  That’s creating spillover effects as Stepn grows in strength. One such example is the upcoming Stepn 5K planned for the AthensDAO conference of Solana-based decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) in late May. Dean Pappas, leader at the social networking project Grape who is helping organize the conference, said many Grape members already use Stepn.  “We’re excited to show people the in-real-life crypto applications, and Stepn is one of the best examples. Stepn succeeds in making the entire experience simple and seamless: Exercise for 10 minutes a day and earn,” he said in a Telegram message.  The app rewards users for their steps in its native cryptocurrency. GST increased in price by 50% in the last 30 days, according to CoinGecko. It was trading at $4.80 at press time.  But getting the rewards requires NFT ownership, much as with P2E giant Axie Infinity. Stepn users can trade their SOL for NFT sneakers in the game’s mobile app – and then they start running.  Those shoes are flying. According to Manghani, STEPN sees over $12 million in daily NFT trading volume on Solana. The former CEO of home-fitness enterprise Breathe Happy said the project is attractive for users because “you don’t have to buy a £1,000 [$1,300] bike or Peloton.”  At time of writing, the cheapest NFT sneakers are 11.5 SOL (around $1,100). Players must own the pricey NFT to begin running for money.  Stepn is planning a rental feature, where shoeless users can effectively lease other players’ sneakers for free and share the earnings from running.  Pappas, the Grape lead, said the feature is badly needed.  “Stepn sneakers are getting really expensive,” he said.  Leasing digital assets in P2E games has been criticized for creating “digital serfdom” in which players who cannot afford the NFTs necessary to play these games rent from third-party lenders, who subject players to long hours of gameplay with little compensation.  But there are, in fact, games with no price on participation.  Move-to-earn game Genopets, where players are similarly rewarded in crypto for their real-life steps, combines free-to-play and play-to-earn because it costs nothing to mint the NFTs necessary to play and earn tokens.  Still in beta mode, Genopets has rather modest statistics. It’s especially popular on Fridays when fresh challenges drive 30,000 players on the platform, co-founder Jay Chang told CoinDesk over Telegram.  These numbers pale against Stepn, suggesting that people are more than willing to pay for move-to-earn experiences.",POSITIVE,SOL,AXS | BUSINESS | SOL | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/12/stepn-runners-undeterred-by-move-to-earn-games-pricey-nft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90cfda4de56706e0c57acc79d696ed50fbf55dfd-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395560,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxtDv,1649794474,Market Wrap: Crypto Sell-Off Pauses as Volatility Fades; Altcoins Outperform,"Most cryptocurrencies stabilized on Tuesday amid a slowdown in volatility.  Sharp price swings have been the norm this year as macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty kept traders on edge. A combination of war, rising interest rates, inflation and slower economic growth have caused investors to reduce their exposure to risk, particularly during the first half of the month.  For example, price action over the past two weeks has resembled pullbacks that occurred in the first half of February and March. That could point to a brief recovery phase in cryptos and stocks, barring any unforeseen circumstances.  Just launched! Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why.  Most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperformed bitcoin on Tuesday, suggesting a greater appetite for risk among traders. Shiba Inu's SHIB token rose by 12% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 2% decline in BTC. NEAR, the native token of the Near protocol, was up by 3%, while Convex Finance's CVX token was down by 6% over the past 24 hours.  Stocks were mostly flat on Tuesday as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield declined. Gold, a traditional safe haven, traded higher, which could point to underlying uncertainty in the market.  In other news, the monthly U.S. Consumer Price Index came in slightly higher than expected on Tuesday, at 8.5%, a fresh four-decade high. But some analysts and economists are now predicting the report might mark the peak of the current inflation cycle.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $39341, −1.63%    ●Ether (ETH): $2975, −1.05%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4397, −0.34%    ●Gold: $1972 per troy ounce, +1.42%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.73%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Volatility patterns  The rise in bitcoin's volatility over the past few days was short-lived, which could point to a short-term stabilization in BTC's spot price.  ""BTC volatility markets are not showing too much panic,"" QCP Capital, a crypto trading firm, wrote in a Telegram announcement. The firm noted that near-term volatility ticked higher over the past day, while long-term volatility barely budged.  ""One distinct pattern that we've noticed is that front-end volatility has been moving inversely with the BTC spot price,"" QCP wrote. ""This means when spot is lower, volatility is higher, and when spot is higher, volatility is lower.""  Lately, traders have been demanding more call options than put options, which creates an imbalance. ""As a result, when prices go higher, there is much less panic or fear in the market than when prices collapse,"" QCP wrote. That has forced some traders to scramble in search of put options to protect themselves on the downside.  The chart below shows a slight uptick in the bitcoin put/call ratio, which indicates greater uncertainty among market participants. The ratio has trended lower so far this year, although a turnaround could point to higher volatility in crypto prices.  Currently, the options market is placing a 62% chance that BTC will trade above $36,000 in May, which is near the bottom of the cryptocurrency's two-month price range.

42394218,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaSjj,1649790325,Bitcoin and Today’s Wicked Inflation Share a Common Ancestor,"It’s not that the economy is going through a wringer it hasn’t been through before, but it is still a period of rapid change. Today, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced consumer prices rose 8.5% for the 12 months that ended in March – the fastest inflation rate in 40-odd years. That means we’re all paying more for just about everything.  There are material explanations. The world’s supply chains have been tied in a knot, ports are backed up, and the literal fuel for the economy – oil and gas – is getting more expensive, in part, due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  A more heterodox view, perhaps familiar to CoinDesk’s audience, follows the money rather than supposedly exogenous factors. To combat the coronavirus, which stunned the world, U.S. policymakers printed about a century’s worth of dollars in two years.  “It’s going to be a very difficult couple of years or more ahead for the U.S. economy and for the Federal Reserve,” former Kansas City Fed lead and current fellow at the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center, Thomas Hoenig, told MarketWatch in a February interview.  The Federal Reserve is now in a perilous position of having to keep their word to increase lending rates to slow down the economy and combat inflation. It has to do that without risking popping an asset bubble across financial assets and causing more pain. Everything from stocks to home prices to crypto to yachts has surged during a period of easy money.  See also: Bitcoin Isn't an Inflation Hedge Yet, but Here's How It Could Be | Opinion  Not enough people are willing to say plainly that we’re in an era of great monetary experimentation. This includes the Federal Reserve’s recent ultra-dovish policy to keep interest rates low, low, low to the adoption of alternative monetary structures like Bitcoin that want to keep monetary issuance steady, predictable and final.  Although there are no easy answers or pain-free solutions to the current inflationary crisis, it may be worth noting how today is the result of decisions in the past.  Black sheep  Hoenig is one of those black sheep, heterodox thinkers. A lifelong, soft-spoken institutionalist, he became infamous in 2010 as the lone dissenter of a novel policy of monetary experimentation called “quantitative easing” (QE) – when the Fed buys financial assets from private banks to flood the economy with capital.  Although calling out what was then a truly novel course, Hoenig was branded the “Doomsday Prophet.”  Just two years after the beginning of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), then reigning Fed Chairman Ben Bernacke was looking to quicken the recovery of the U.S. economy through QE. The Fed had used this tool at the height of the crisis, but Bernacke, in 2010, wanted to pursue long-term intervention.  In QE, money the Fed pays to banks is meant to be reinvested and loaned out to help create jobs for the unemployed. But it also plays with the levers of finance in interesting ways. Under QE, the Fed primarily buys U.S. Treasurys, which are treated as risk-free investments and used by financial institutions as a way to store their cash.  Quantitative easing makes Treasurys more expensive by taking them off the market and pushes banks into riskier investments. The current monetary regime could be seen as an extension and exaggeration of a policy pursued a decade ago.  In 2010, Hoenig, nearing retirement at the time, was the sole voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) against long-term intervention. He worried that QE would eventually destabilize the economy and lead to inflation. That the Fed, by encouraging riskier lending by banks, would create asset bubbles.  There’s some disagreement about Hoenig’s legacy, whether he was right or wrong about the short-term impacts of QE. The decade preceding the coronavirus saw low unemployment and low inflation. But the idea that an asset bubble grew and grew over the past decade seems trivially true.  Crypto is both part of that inflationary environment and charting out a new path for a financial system without middlemen. Bitcoin in particular is aiming to become a global reserve asset that cannot be debased by the decisions of central bankers.  See also: What the Fed Thinks About CDBCs  It’s a nice thesis, but we’re never seen the crypto ecosystem function alongside a traditional financial system with higher rates and less intervention. It might be the case that fewer people look to alternative asset classes if their banks actually pay a saving rate.  Down the pike  Hoenig is now calling for the Fed to be steadfast about raising rates in a “systemic and persistent” way. But he thinks it’s likely it’ll waffle.  “As you get inflation rising, then it puts increasing pressure on the central banks – on the Federal Reserve in particular – to address that [by] increasing interest rates,” he told MarketWatch. The trouble is, that will almost certainly cause “the reversal of the stimulus” with it, he said.  As gauche as it is to compare the Fed, one of America’s most powerful institutions and the keeper of the currency, to Bitcoin, an upstart financial system that reroutes activity to a deflationary environment, it’s worth noting the shared beginning of these modern institutions.  A decade ago, the Fed began an awesome monetary experiment that we’re living with today.

Number Of Active Bitcoin Entities Continues To Remain In Bear Market Channel As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the number of active BTC entities has observed a persistent user growth recently. The &apos;number of active entities&apos; is an indicator that tells us about the number of daily active users on the Bitcoin network. An entity here refers to a collection of addresses held by a single investor, so the number of entities isn&apos;t the same as the total number of addresses on the network. When the value of this indicator rises, it means more holders are making trades right now. A sharp growth can suggest a large number of new investors are ushering into the Bitcoin market. On the other hand, decreasing values of the metric implies interest around the crypto is diminishing as investors go dormant.

42420983,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAozF,1649788170,"Scenes From Bitcoin Miami 2022: The Stars, the Shows and That Giant Bull","More than 25,000 of the Bitcoin faithful poured into Miami Beach last week for the biggest crypto asset's most extravagant conference yet. They came to party, swap trading strategies, hear about tech developments and hobnob with the ""orange pilled"" from around the world. CoinDesk's Danny Nelson came to photograph it all.  Miami Beach's sprawling Convention Center was a scene of perpetual motion during the four-day conference. Ticket-holders shuffled between the jam-packed expo hall and four satellite stages, each with its own flair and theme. Needing to get quickly from one far-flung location to the next could spell trouble for those in a time crunch.  In a not-so-subtle jab at Wall Street's famous bovine, Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez unveiled a 3,000-pound charging bull statue on conference day one. He said it's meant to capture the spirit of a tech hub on the rise. Left unsaid: Miami Beach isn't his city; Mayor Dan Gelber actually runs these parts. Still, Suarez's self-styled crypto booster persona made him a lock for the ribbon-cutting, a local cop later said.  Bitcoin's most fervent maximalists treat the asset more like a religion than an investment. In this church, the faithful wear their allegiance on their sleeve – or their feet. Kraken Head of Growth Dan Held's ""Hodl"" kicks (pictured right) was one piece of bitcoin regalia among many.  Don't mistake organizers' bitcoin-not-s**tcoin discourse demands for closed-mindedness. The conference attracted viewpoints from across the political spectrum, with libertarian Jo Jorgensen, centrist Andrew Yang and conservative Tucker Carlson (pictured center) filtering through. Their talk didn't always stay on digital assets, though. In this scene, Carlson, a Fox News commentator, revealed to the crowd he hasn't worn socks in over two years.  Bitcoin A-listers were a common sight at the conference's main stage. Here, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor and ARK Investments chief Cathie Wood fed the crowd a steady stream of pro-bitcoin commentary. They're well-placed to pontificate: Tech-centric Wood is among the biggest bitcoin boosters on Wall Street, and Saylor's billion-dollar bags speak for themselves.  It wasn't all parties in South Beach. Lyn Ulbricht, mother of imprisoned Silk Road developer Ross Ulbricht, was on hand to rally for her son's release. He faces multiple life sentences for running the once-popular darknet drug marketplace, an early hub for bitcoin transactions. Supporters view him as a victim of the powerful state. Pictured here is Ross' jailhouse painting ""Human Blockchain,""one of the many pieces on display in the conference's eclectic art gallery.  Bitcoiners' gag order on s**tcoins did not span the causeway. Back on the Miami mainland, a miniature army of Solana developers was hard at work building their parallel crypto universe They all knew of the big conference next door – a handful even went – but most had come to Wynwood's ""Hacker House"" with coding on their minds.  A ""bitcoin music festival"" capped days of conferencing. The rapper Logic (pictured here) performed for the first time in three years, and DJ Steve Aoki and rapper Killer Mike also had acts. Some tossed the crowd a quick bitcoin shout-out, but much of the ""meta"" discourse came from the festival's comedians. Jay Pharaoh and Jimmy O. Yang laughed off boos when they mentioned ""cryptocurrencies"" and ""non-fungible tokens"" to the bitcoin-only crowd. But anchor act Hannibal Buress wasn't as quick thinking. He lost the audience when his riffs on scams and meme coins bombed.

42421186,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgITF,1649787012,Cathy Hackl: The 'Godmother of the Metaverse',"Clinique had a problem. The brand wanted to “enter the metaverse,” but it didn’t want to do so in a way that was cringey. So, it called a woman named Cathy Hackl: the “Godmother of the Metaverse.”  Her credentials? Hackl, the “chief metaverse officer” of Futures Intelligence Group, a metaverse consulting firm, has worked in metaverse-related fields for nearly a decade – or basically since the dawn of meta-time.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more. It originally appeared in December's Culture Week.  Just ask Steven Spielberg. When filming “Ready Player One,” Spielberg partnered with the virtual reality headset company HTC Vive, where Hackl served as “VR Evangelist.” At Magic Leap, an augmented reality company, she worked with the man who coined the term metaverse, Neal Stephenson. And over a year before the current craze, she wrote articles for Forbes like “The Metaverse Is Coming And It’s A Very Big Deal.”  It was such a big deal that Hackl left a cushy job at Amazon Web Services to “take a big bet on the metaverse.” Now she advises brands – like Clinique – on how to position themselves in this strange new market. (Her work with Clinique fetched a glowing write-up from Vogue Business.)  In an interview with CoinDesk, the Godmother shares why the metaverse is larger than perhaps the crypto crowd realizes, why avatars are fast becoming “emotional surrogates of ourselves"" and how in the future, “every company is going to need a metaverse strategy.”  The term “metaverse” can mean 10 different things to 10 different people – even inside the crypto space. When you start working with clients, how do you explain it to them?  Cathy Hackl: I usually start from the past. Web 1 connected information, so you got the internet. And did that change anything for your brand? It probably did. Web 2 connected people and you got social media, the sharing economy. Did that change anything for your brand? Of course it did, right?  Right.  And now we’re in the evolution of Web 2 going into Web 3. And Web 3, it connects people, places, and things – or people, spaces and assets. And those people, spaces and assets can sometimes be in a fully virtual environment, like most people tend to think.  Read more: Play-to-Earn Is Already the Biggest Star in the Metaverse - Jeff Wilser  But it’s also going to be in our real world with some level of augmentation, probably through a wearable. So, Web 3 is kind of enabling the creation of the metaverse, and the metaverse is a convergence of physical and digital. Think of it as the successor of what comes next on the internet. It’s like your digital lifestyle catching up to your physical life.  That’s a pretty expansive view. So, it includes not just blockchain projects, like Decentraland, but also augmented reality from traditional platforms?  Yeah. Even Snapchat, the things that they can do with the camera for augmented reality – that’s a metaverse play. That’s all part of the metaverse. I have a pretty expansive view, and part of that comes from working in VR (virtual reality) hardware, spatial computing and augmented reality hardware. And when people think the metaverse is only virtual reality, or only fully immersive, I think that’s a pretty narrow view. And a pretty dystopic one.  With that wide of a definition, I’m guessing the blockchain metaverse projects are only a small slice of the overall “metaverse pie”?  It is small, but it’s ever increasing. You’ve got SoftBank leading the investment for $93 million in a Series B [for The Sandbox]. Upland just raised $18 million, I believe, with a $300 million valuation. You’ve got a lot of these blockchain projects – like NFT (non-fungible token) gaming metaverses – growing really fast.  How does blockchain fit into your vision for the metaverse?  You cannot enable the open decentralized metaverse that many of us dream of without blockchain, right? Blockchain is the underlying component. NFTs are a bit of a stepping-stone into the metaverse when it comes to ownership of digital assets and digital identity. How do you actually enable that? NFTs are a big part of that equation.  What’s the biggest potential for brands?  One of the big things that I try to explore is, “Is direct-to-avatar the next direct-to-consumer?” Again, it’s stepping-stones. When we text people, we use emojis; we don’t even write anymore. We use an emoji to represent a message. Our emojis – and by extension our avatars – are becoming emotional surrogates of ourselves.  In order to represent yourself as an avatar, that’s a big thing. Because it’s a moment of self-expression, it’s a moment of self-exploration. And how do brands play into that? Well, I’m going to have to outfit my avatar. Maybe I want to make a statement and wear Supreme. Fashion and culture go together. How does your avatar show up, right? What does it look like, what does it wear? There are going to be a lot of opportunities for brands. And there will be opportunities for them to engage with the younger generation.  I can see how it’s obvious for some brands – especially in wearables and fashion – to get involved in the avatar game. But how about for less obvious brands? I mean, how does a food company make a metaverse play?  Well, people are saying that Chipotle caused the [Roblox] outage. (Of course, it didn’t cause the outage – let’s get that straight.) But a brand like Chipotle can come in and say, “We’re going to do a burrito, and we’re going to give away $1 million worth of burritos in the game.” I think those types of things are interesting and fun, and the audience is engaged, they enjoyed it.  What do you see as some of the biggest obstacles that need to be overcome for the metaverse to become more mainstream?  There are a lot of things that need to happen. If you look at how many people actually have [digital] wallets, it’s actually a very small number. And it’s a generational thing. My kids understand digital ownership in a way that maybe older generations don’t. They love buying digital assets and their skins. Once my kids get older, they’re going to question, “Why can’t I take this asset that I paid so much money for in Roblox, and move it over to Fortnite?” Eventually they’re going to expect that.  And that leads to more of an appreciation for NFTs and a desire for open worlds, got it. What else is needed for the metaverse to take off?  There will be a serious need for computing power. And right now, obviously you’ve got supply chain issues related to chips, so that might slow things down.  There also needs to be a lot of education within organizations – and not just the brand team – to understand where this is headed. And for companies, there’s already a talent war, so it’s hard to hire people. When you realize that every company is going to need a metaverse strategy, then hiring is going to get even harder. That’s why I partnered with Republic Realm to create the Republic Realm Academy, for executive education.  How does Facebook fit into all of this? What’s your reaction to Mark Zuckerberg’s meta play?  I take the good with the bad. I mean, it is a validation of the work that many of us have been doing for years. So, I’ll take that. On the other side, with Facebook being so literal with the name “meta,” it does cast a bit of doubt and shadow on the metaverse. The big thing is confusion – people thinking the metaverse is Facebook. It is not.  I was at an event having breakfast with some speakers. I sat down, and someone asked me what I do. I said, “I do metaverse strategies.” And they said, “Isn’t that Facebook?”  No!  [Laughs.] Yeah. So, I think there is that level of confusion. I don’t know how many people read the news that Facebook rebranded to Meta, and they learned the word because of that.  How many years until we get to a “Ready Player One”-style metaverse?  First of all, I will say “The Oasis” (the fully immersive platform in “Ready Player One”) is not what we should aim for. That’s pretty dystopic, where the real world has gone to s**t, and you have to escape reality. [Laughs.] I don’t want to escape reality, but I want the metaverse to be somewhere fun when I want to have fun – instead of Instagram.  So how long until we get there?  I don’t think anyone can put a time or date, but I will say that this decade is a decade of building and pioneering. We’re all testing, trying to understand how it all works. This is the decade where those foundations are created. It’s a time of change and a time for creators. Now is the time to build. Now is when you start to figure out, what does this mean? Where are we going?

At the same time, the top cryptocurrencies by market cap continue moving in a tight range with today&apos;s U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing volatility across the board. Related Reading | TA: Bitcoin Resumes Decline, Why BTC Could Revisit $40K At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $40,500 with a 1% loss in the last 24-hours and a 13% loss in the last week. Ethereum trades at $3,000 with similar performance over this period. As NewsBTC has been reporting, Hayes believes the current financial system supported by the &apos;Petrodollar&apos; has ended. This opened the door for a new system where independent currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, will see more demand. Ethereum stands to benefit the most in the short term as it will transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Thus, it&apos;ll see a 99% decline in its energy consumption with a staking system that will yield rewards to network validators. Institutions will take shelter from inflation using this system, Hayes argued. However, the top cryptocurrencies will undergo an increase in selling pressure in the short to medium term as the U.S. Federal Reserve attempts to tame inflation.

42395555,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxtBx,1649785628,A Spot Bitcoin ETF Still Seems Unlikely,"Several bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds are now trading in the U.S., with more to come, but a spot bitcoin ETF remains elusive. Industry proponents hope that the recent approval of a futures ETF filed under the same law that governs spot bitcoin ETF applications is a good sign, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has a laundry list of concerns that still need to be addressed.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Tuesday.  When will a spot ETF be approved? (Redux)  The narrative  Another bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) was approved for the U.S. market last week. And unlike the case for the others, the way it’s structured opens the door for a spot bitcoin ETF, something the industry has long clamored for. Recent spot bitcoin ETF rejections, however, suggest it may not be that simple.  Why it matters  A spot bitcoin ETF would trade based on the price of bitcoin, as opposed to futures ETFs, which trade based on the price of bitcoin futures. Bitcoin futures are a smaller market than spot bitcoin and aren’t directly correlated to the price of bitcoin (since again, they are futures). Crypto industry proponents have been calling for a spot ETF as a safe way for traders to enter the bitcoin market without directly investing in the cryptocurrency itself.  Breaking it down  The SEC approved a bitcoin futures ETF last week. Unlike previous futures ETF applications, this one was filed under the “33 Act” (or the Securities Act of 1933) and the “34 Act” (or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). All of the past bitcoin futures ETFs were filed under “40 Act” (the Investment Company Act of 1940).  I asked last year whether 2021 would be the year of the bitcoin ETF and concluded – in February – that the answer was basically 🤷. The question now is whether 2022 will be the year of the spot bitcoin ETF, and the answer seems to be more 🙅 than 🤷.  SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said last year he felt more comfortable with 40 Act funds because of the investor protections enshrined within the law, as well as the market surveillance tools overseeing the futures market. The bulk of the volume is on Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a traditional firm with long-standing surveillance tools in place.  The SEC’s recent rejection orders seem to echo this premise.  “The Commission concludes that BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), and in particular, the requirement that the rules of a national securities exchange be ‘designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and ‘to protect investors and the public interest,’” SEC staffers wrote in rejecting the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF.  The SEC used identical language a month earlier in rejecting the NYDIG Bitcoin ETF.  But people want a bitcoin ETF. A Nasdaq survey of 500 financial advisers found that 72% would be more comfortable investing in crypto if there was also a spot ETF.  An important caveat here is this survey was of financial advisers who are already considering allocating funds to crypto, and so the respondents weren’t necessarily representative of financial advisers at large in the U.S.  Let’s back up. The reason I’m talking about this today is that the SEC approved Teucrium’s bitcoin futures ETF to begin trading last week. Unlike ProShares, Valkyrie or VanEck, Teucrium filed for a 33 Act fund. The approval jump-started fresh speculation that a spot bitcoin ETF may be closer to approval.  At the very least, the 33 Act approval would seem to serve as evidence should a company such as CoinDesk sister firm Grayscale decide to file a legal challenge of some sort to a future SEC rejection.  Grayscale has already argued that the previous futures ETF approvals create ground for the approval of a spot ETF (Grayscale filed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF).  The bitcoin derivatives markets have identical exposure to fraud and manipulation that the spot markets might have, Grayscale’s attorneys wrote in a letter to the regulator last year.  “It is of course foundational that the Commission – like any other federal regulatory agency – must treat like situations alike absent reasoned justification,” the letter said.  The SEC took aim at that argument in its Teucrium approval order, with staffers writing that they accepted NYSE Arca’s argument that for anyone to manipulate bitcoin futures ETF prices, they would have to manipulate CME’s bitcoin futures market directly, and not just the bitcoin spot market.  “The Commission has considered and rejected nearly identical arguments in past disapproval orders of spot bitcoin ETPs. Moreover, the Commission finds arguments centered around the relationship between the bitcoin spot market and the CME bitcoin futures market to be inapposite where, as here, the proposed ‘significant’ market (i.e., the CME bitcoin futures market) is the same as the market on which the proposed ETP’s only non-cash assets (i.e., CME bitcoin futures contracts) trade,” the SEC wrote.  In its recent rejections, the SEC wrote that the stock exchanges sponsoring spot crypto ETFs have “not sufficiently” argued against the agency’s concerns about manipulation and fraud.  “Such possible sources have included (1) ‘wash’ trading, (2) persons with a dominant position in bitcoin manipulating bitcoin pricing, (3) hacking of the bitcoin network and trading platforms, (4) malicious control of the bitcoin network, (5) trading based on material, non-public information, including the dissemination of false and misleading information, (6) manipulative activity involving the purported ‘stablecoin’ Tether (USDT), and (7) fraud and manipulation at bitcoin trading platforms,” the SEC wrote.  The agency has also said it’s concerned that the crypto spot exchanges are themselves unregulated (left unsaid is that they are unregulated at the federal level, not the state level as every U.S. crypto exchange is supposed to be).  Given that the SEC has consistently expressed concerns about market manipulation in rejecting spot bitcoin ETF applications, it seems likely (to me anyway) that the agency will continue to reject spot ETF applications, at least for the foreseeable future.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  U.S. President Joe Biden has nominated Jaime Lizárraga and Mark Uyeda to fill two seats on the SEC. Lizárraga is now a senior adviser to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), while Uyeda is an SEC attorney working with the Senate Banking Committee minority staff as securities counsel, according to a White House press release.  Elsewhere, Politico’s Victoria Guida reports that Michael Barr, a former Treasury Department official, former Ripple board member and current dean at the University of Michigan is under consideration to be the Federal Reserve's vice chairman for supervision, the role Sarah Bloom Raskin was previously nominated for. Barr was also under consideration for comptroller of the currency last year but received pushback.  Elsewhere:  Crypto Rules Should Match Traditional Financial System, Yellen to Say Thursday: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen gave a speech on the crypto industry and how it may be regulated, calling for “tech neutral” rules.  France's Presidential Candidates Ignore Crypto Issues: A few weeks ago, we published an article on how South Korea’s presidential candidates were pitching to crypto voters in the country. Half a world away, crypto is barely on the radar in France’s election, which saw incumbent Emmanuel Macron and challenger Marine Le Pen advance to a runoff.  Top US Lawmaker Proposes Sweeping Stablecoin Regulation Framework: Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, circulated a discussion draft bill that would create a three-pronged approach for stablecoin regulation. As outlined, the bill would give stablecoin issuers the option of operating under a new license issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, operating as a traditional bank or operating as a state money transmitter business, with strict disclosure and redemption rules in place.  Can India’s Controversial New Tax Law Be Challenged in Court? Yes, Say Crypto Lawyers: India’s 30% tax on crypto profits took effect on April 1. Several attorneys don’t believe this part of India’s strict crypto tax law can be challenged. The 1% tax deducted at source, however, may be another matter.  New York Senate Authorizes NYDFS to 'Assess' Crypto Companies: The New York Senate has authorized the state Department of Financial Services to develop an “assessment,” or charge for the crypto companies it oversees to help offset some of the costs of this oversight. “The ability for DFS to charge fees is in line with standard practice in the banking and insurance sectors. With increased funding, DFS will have the capacity to hire additional staff with a background and expertise in crypto, allowing DFS to evolve alongside the industry and support New York's position as the center of financial innovation,” the Global Blockchain Business Council told CoinDesk’s Cheyenne Ligon.

42395551,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxt81,1649785263,Pantera Capital Set to Close $1.3B Blockchain Fund,"Pantera Capital plans to close the Pantera Blockchain Fund, its first blockchain fund, in the next three to four weeks with about $1.3 billion in committed capital, according to an investor conference call.  The amount is more than double the $600 million target when the company began fundraising last November. Pantera last month said commitments then had surpassed $1 billion.  The fund was launched during a record-setting period for crypto investment vehicles, including a $2.5 billion fund from Paradigm that also begun in November.  Pantera also outlined its near-term road map, including plans for a second blockchain fund in 2023. Franklin Bi, director of portfolio development at Pantera, said the follow-up will have essentially the same objectives as the initial fund – new deals in early-stage, private tokens and venture capital.  “We will come back with a larger and more diversified and probably longer-investment-period growth-stage fund, say in 2024,” Bi added, speaking about the firm's plans beyond the second blockchain fund.  The investor call was for the new Pantera Select Fund announced last week with a $200 million commitment to invest in “more mature, revenue generating companies,” according to a client letter.  The Select Fund was Pantera’s fifth, joining the Bitcoin Fund, Early-Stage Token Fund, Liquid Token Fund and Blockchain Fund. Select is “smaller, more targeted and therefore more concentrated than a typical growth fund,” Pantera said. The deadline for limited partners to get in on the Select Fund is May 1.

42411824,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDVx,1649784024,What Happens to Your Crypto When You Die?,"If you hold any amount of cryptocurrency, you’ve probably given some thought to its security. After all, what good is investing your money in assets if other people can easily steal them?  But there’s another aspect of crypto security that’s equally as important and often overlooked by both novice and experienced users: What will happen to your crypto after you die?  This might seem like an obvious consideration, but according to Glassnode data from late 2020 it’s estimated that over 10% of bitcoin’s circulating supply is lost forever. Of course, it’s impossible to know exactly how those coins were lost, but we can assume that at least some were because of people not having adequate measures in place for after they passed.  So what do you need to do to ensure your loved ones receive your crypto should the worst happen?  Read More: Only 23% of Hodlers Have a Crypto Estate Plan: Survey  The security trade-off and importance of choosing the right person  Before we look at the steps you’ll need to take to properly secure your assets, it’s important to first understand the significant security trade-off that comes with telling another person or people about where and how to access your crypto-based wealth.  Choosing the right person to give your crypto assets to is a lot more complex than it sounds. It’s not exclusively about trust, but about how technologically savvy is that particular person or group of people.  For example, Bob has five bitcoin (BTC) that he wants to leave to his wife Alice in the event he dies. However, Alice has no idea how to use a hardware wallet or an exchange. This means she must either find or employ another person to help her access the funds – which can present a significant security risk – or try and learn how to use these platforms and devices. Again, this also presents a security risk given how easy it is to send crypto to the wrong address, get locked out of devices or withdraw assets using the wrong token standards.  Tether (USDT) is an example of a crypto asset that has three different token variations – OMNI, ERC-20 and TRC-20 – depending on what blockchain the tokens are issued. Sending any one of these to another would result in the coins being permanently lost. So, for instance, OMNI-based USDT coins sent to an ERC-20 wallet address would not be recoverable.  Read more: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  Another big question is, how much information should you divulge? Obviously you’ll need to disclose enough about your crypto holdings for someone to be able to access them, but do you entrust that information to one person or is it worth dividing the instructions among several trusted individuals?  Only you will know what is the best course of action, but it’s certainly something to consider.  Hedging your bets across a group of people has its pros and cons. Namely, it prevents any single person from being able to steal your crypto funds while you’re still alive, but the main drawback of enlisting multiple trustees is the whole system collapses if one person mislays his or her piece of the instructions.  What steps all crypto users should take  Once you’ve decided on whom you’re going to elect as the beneficiary of your crypto funds, the next step is to outline the procedure for locating and claiming them.  Location of your funds  The first piece of information you’ll want to include in your instructions is where to find your assets. This includes the physical location of any hardware wallet(s) you own as well as in what hot wallets you have crypto stored.  If your assets are located in multiple places – such as decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity pools, centralized exchanges and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces – it might be a good idea to consolidate them into crypto wallets that support multiple asset types. MetaMask is one example of a service that lets you store fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single, easy-to-access wallet.  Passwords, private keys and backup codes  Second, you’ll need to carefully list all the passwords, private keys and seed phrases for the crypto wallets, email accounts and exchange accounts needed to access your funds.  If you have two-factor authentication (2FA) switched on, you’ll also need to provide either the location and password for the device where the app is stored or a list of 2FA one-time backup codes.  If your accounts are set up to receive SMS security messages, you’ll also need to include details pertaining to the location and password of your current mobile device (updated periodically as you change handsets).  Technical advice  You may wish to include steps on how your beneficiary should handle or liquidate your assets. This might include instructing on which exchange is best to use or outlining a brief walkthrough guide on how to set up his or her own wallet and transfer the funds across.  You’ll also need to be mindful that certain platforms come and go over time, not to mention some experience security breaches that may force you to transfer funds over to new wallets. This means you’ll likely need to update your instructions over time.  How to copy down your sensitive crypto information  Making copies of your private crypto information doesn’t mean writing your seed phrases on a post-it note and sticking it to the fridge or sending the information via email.  These details should be copied down on paper and copied several times. Each copy should then ideally be stored in different locations to remove any single point of failure. For example, if you kept only a single paper copy in a bedside table and the house caught fire, your beneficiary would never be able to access the funds – that might sound a bit wild, but it can happen.  To maximize the level of security, there are companies that provide kits for storing seed phrases and passwords on metal plates. These provide additional protection against things like house fires, water damage and most other things that could damage a paper copy. Leading providers include:  Cryptotag  Cryptosteel  Crypto Key Stack  In addition, British law firm Farrer & Co points out that when you do get around to creating a list, you should not include it in your will. That’s because any information in the will, including your crypto passwords, will become legally available to the public after you’re gone.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | USDT,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-happens-to-your-crypto-when-you-die,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96b1ae8ed757e4468c28e5e268ad92ae0de8e3b5-2371x1264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395552,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxt45,1649780922,Former Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith Sentenced to 5+ Years in Prison for North Korea Trip,"Former Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith will serve 63 months in prison and pay a $100,000 fine for helping North Koreans use cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions.  In September, Griffith pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate international sanctions against North Korea. Griffith was arrested in November 2019 after giving a talk at a cryptocurrency conference in Pyongyang in April of that year.  Read more: Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy Charge in North Korea Sanctions Case  Though the crime carried a maximum penalty of 20 years, Griffith’s plea deal with federal prosecutors brought the sentence down to a range of 63 to 78 months – approximately five to 6.5 years. Griffith has already spent approximately two years in custody, though he was released on bail for 14 of those months. The court will count the remaining 10 months as time served.  The sentence handed down by U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York on Tuesday is on the lower end of the prosecution’s suggested sentencing guidelines, and is in line with the sentence recommended by the Department of Probation.  Defense asks for leniency  Before Griffith was sentenced, he and his attorneys had a chance to address the court with any last objections or remarks.  Griffith, clad in a khaki prison uniform, exchanged glances with his elderly parents and several friends in the courtroom.  Brian Klein, Griffith’s lead attorney, urged Judge Castel to consider factors that he believed had not been accounted for in the prosecution’s sentencing guidelines, including the harsh conditions at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), where Griffith has been held.  Klein described “several really trying and inhumane conditions” Griffith experienced at MDC, including extended solitary quarantines due to COVID-19 outbreaks, no family visits, limited access to blankets and warm clothing, and even being forced to use his sink as a toilet.  Klein also said Griffith has been limited to two or less meals a day, usually peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, because gangs in MDC control the kitchens and the commissary.  Because of the harsh conditions, Klein asked the judge to consider counting the 10 months Griffith has spent in prison as double, and asked that his client be moved to Allenwood Low, a low-security federal prison in Pennsylvania, where he might be closer to extended family.  Klein also informed Judge Castel of a recent psychological assessment of Griffith, done in prison, which apparently found him to be suffering from two personality disorders, Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). His defense said the disorders explained his “obsession” with North Korea and his disregard for the warnings of his family, friends, employer, and the government not to travel to North Korea.  Griffith, Klein said, has been “dedicated to therapy” and was found by the psychiatrist to be “treatable” and “not likely to reoffend.”  When Griffith himself was given an opportunity to speak, he told the court that he had spent time in prison thinking about how he “genuinely, arrogantly, and erroneously thought I knew better,” than his loved ones who warned him against going to North Korea.  “I’ve learned my lesson,” Griffith said. “I am still profoundly embarrassed that I am here, and of what I have done.”  A wannabe ‘crypto hero’?  The court did not appear to be moved by Griffith’s claims to have learned his lesson, or his promises not to reoffend.  “There is an argument that Virgil Griffith is a kind and thoughtful man,” Castel told the courtroom, describing a version of events in which “at great personal sacrifice to himself” Griffith traveled to North Korea to share educational materials about blockchain technology and returned to persecution.  “But those are not the facts,” Castel said. “That is not what happened.”  “What you see here is an intentionality…and a desire to educate people on how to evade sanctions,” Castel said.  Judge Castel read a series of text messages and emails from Griffith in which the defendant admits to sharing information with North Korea for the express purpose of helping the repressive Kim regime evade sanctions.  What the judge found most damning, perhaps, was a photo of Griffith presenting at the conference, wearing a traditional North Korean suit and standing in front of a blackboard on which it read “No sanctions!” with a smiley face.  “The fact of the matter is Virgil Griffith…hoped to come home to Singapore or elsewhere as a crypto hero,” Castel said. “To be admired and praised for standing up to government sanctions, for his fearlessness and nobility.”  Castel blasted Griffith’s history of cooperation with the government both before and after his trip to Pyongyang – held up by the defense as evidence of his good nature – as narcissism.  “This guy is willing to play both sides of the street as long as he is the center of attention,” Castel said.  Both the judge and the prosecution referenced the ongoing war in Ukraine, as well as the U.S. government’s use of sanctions against Russia, to justify the need for a harsh sentence in order to deter Griffith and “similarly-situated others” from future violations of U.S. sanctions laws.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/12/former-ethereum-developer-virgil-griffith-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-north-korea-trip,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/578c4828c5ceaf3677b4997351fa6a37bacdee16-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the acquisition, Infinite said it seeks to add ReKT’s entertainment and esports business to its existing platform, which covers social, gaming, virtual and remote production, non-fungible token (NFT) minting, content and metaverse creation.  The deal is based on an equity valuation for Infinite Reality of $2 billion, for a combined post-close valuation of $2.47 billion. Infinite Reality plans to go public in a SPAC merger with Universal Security Instruments (UUU).  Infinite was formed from the merger of social ecommerce platform Display Social, entertainment production company Thunder Studios and metaverse builder Infinite Metaverse.  “The synergies across our combined business units from content creation to Web 3 entertainment to APIs and more are awe inspiring,” Infinite CEO John Acunto said in a statement.  ReKT is known for its esports teams such as Team Rogue and London Loyal Ravens. Rogue has garnered 14 world titles and 23 major championships, according to ReKT’s website.

Starting April 15, only “accredited” U.S. investors will be able to add new assets and earn rewards on Celsius' Earn platform, said the company. To be deemed accredited in the U.S., investors must have a minimum annual income of $200,000 or a net worth over $1 million.  The company said all existing U.S. users – whether accredited or nonaccredited – will continue to earn rewards as long as the coins are in their Earn account prior to April 15.  Those deemed nonaccredited will have their coins held in custody, where they won’t earn rewards but can continue to swap, borrow and transfer within those custody accounts based on their local jurisdiction.  “As we previously have acknowledged, Celsius has been working closely with regulators around the world. It is our intention to be as transparent with our community as possible,” the company said in a blog post Tuesday. “More specifically, we have been in ongoing discussions with United States regulators regarding our Earn product. As a result, there will be changes to the way our Earn product will work for users based in the United States.”  U.S. users wishing to post coins as collateral against a loan opened prior to April 15 will see their assets returned to their accounts when the loan is repaid, the company added.  The company is currently facing several legal investigations from regulators in various U.S. states on allegations its lending and earn programs might be in violation of securities laws.

Abraham Bielski was contacted by a scammer last year claiming to be a PayPal (PYPL) representative. Bielski gave the individual remote access to his Coinbase account from which assets worth $31,039 were transferred.  The plaintiff claimed Coinbase's customer service after the money was removed from his digital wallet was ""meager and ineffective.""  Bielski sought to pursue the case as a class-action lawsuit, representing individuals who had experienced something similar with the crypto exchange.  Coinbase moved to compel arbitration based on its user agreement, which states ""any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Coinbase Services ... shall be resolved by binding arbitration.""  The U.S. District Court for Northern California has deemed the user agreement “imposes a burdensome and unfair pre-arbitration dispute process on users and sends their complaints, but not Coinbase’s complaints, to binding arbitration.""  The ""lack of mutuality"" in the complaint process therefore ""imposes and onerous, unfair burden"" on the party bringing it, according to the court. Therefore, the court found the arbitration agreement ""unconscionable and ... unenforceable.""

(It appears to be a continuation of the network’s anti-maximalist trend.)  Ignite has opened applications for the first round of the six-month program and plans to support 20 projects per year.

Crypto custody and infrastructure firm Prime Trust announced Tuesday the hire of Jeremy Sheridan, former assistant director of investigations at the Secret Service, as vice president of regulatory affairs. The role involves overseeing Prime Trust’s regulatory strategies, engaging with federal and state agencies and serving as a “regulatory thought leader,” according to a company statement.  It’s the latest in a string of a high-profile appointments as crypto firms look to Washington for those with regulatory experience. Last fall, Blockchain.com tapped D.C. lobbyist Ian Mair as head of U.S. public policy.

Toward the end of his Secret Service career, Sheridan was the assistant director for the Office of Investigations and Legislative Affairs, which oversees 161 offices and over 3,000 personnel.  “The Office of Investigations works to protect the nation’s financial infrastructure and financial payment systems,” Sheridan told CoinDesk in an interview. “[The office] started investigations related to digital assets, which informed my perspective and understanding of how digital assets are used for illicit means. It also helped me understand the need for proper regulation and compliance in the digital assets environment.”  Read more: Crypto Learns to Play the DC Influence Game  Founded in 2016, Las Vegas-based Prime Trust provides infrastructure that can help crypto and fintech companies get up and running faster.

42395573,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxxsC,1649768400,"Banks May Face Competition From CBDCs, Study Suggests","Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could put pressure on conventional banks, a survey of central banks found, and the jury is still out on whether central banks would use distributed ledger technology.  The report, published Tuesday by the Bank for International Settlements' Financial Stability Institute (FSI) and World Bank, plays into a debate about whether state-backed digital money could upend the financial system, potentially harming the economy.  Profit-driven banks may be more interested in seeking wealthy clients, rather than ensuring access to the financial system for the 1.7 billion people who don't have access, the FSI argued. By allowing new kinds of private payment providers into the market, “CBDCs could introduce more vibrancy and innovation, leading to more tailored and compelling value propositions for both payers and payees,” the report says.  In addition to taking deposits, commercial banks lend to homeowners and businesses. Some observers worry that supplanting that role entirely could harm the economy. But jurisdictions like the European Union already allow alternative providers to offer services that go beyond what the incumbents are prepared to do. The FSI cited the East Caribbean Central Bank, which gets non-bank institutions to check customers' identity before granting them a digital wallet.  Setting up a new bank is usually tough because regulators insist that a bank stock up large piles of capital to prevent failure. A payment provider that handles only state-backed assets wouldn’t have that risk and could be regulated more lightly, the FSI argued.  “The absence of liquidity and solvency issues for the intermediaries and the associated need for prudential regulation for the CBDC issuer implies that new types of intermediaries could be licensed,” offering extra competition, the report says.  Distributed technology?  The FSI is the analytical arm of the Basel, Switzerland-based BIS, a network of central banks, but the report doesn't necessarily represent the BIS or World Bank’s views.]  Meanwhile, central bankers don’t seem certain CBDCs will necessarily resemble today's cryptocurrencies.  Hyun Song Shin, BIS’ head of research, has already warned that without the pseudonymity offered by the likes of bitcoin (BTC), blockchain-based CBDCs could open up previously private financial transactions to the public gaze.  The FSI is open to the idea that other kinds of technology than distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be deployed for CBDCs, as DLT raises many problems, such as how to prove a transaction is legally final and how to wrest control from a CBDC owner who goes bankrupt. Another issue is how fast can nodes process transactions, the FSI said.  “For the central banks interviewed that are not considering a DLT-based infrastructure, decreased transaction throughput was the main reason given,” the report says. “It is unclear whether DLT offers unconditional advantages for a CBDC.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/12/cbdcs-turn-up-heat-on-banks-may-spurn-distributed-ledgers-study-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d28a1b36b227364fb699407e9fe31828f681b5ef-4551x3686.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The anonymous nature of crypto means DeFi lending protocols typically use overcollateralized loans in which, for example, a borrower puts up $150 in collateral for a $100 loan. The setup is closer to a pawnshop than a traditional bank. RociFi will instead offer zero- to undercollateralized loans by using a borrower’s established DeFi presence to help lenders judge creditworthiness.  The capital will be used to expand the RociFi team and take the product to market with a full-scale launch expected in the second quarter.  “The biggest thing is being able to get the protocol to mainnet, but do it in a safe manner,” RociFi Labs CEO Christopher Brookins told CoinDesk in an interview. “We’re allocating the appropriate resources to make sure we’re not just spinning up a new protocol as fast as possible, which requires capital.”  Read more: DeFi Lending: 3 Major Risks to Know  How it works  The RociFi protocol leverages on-chain data, machine learning and decentralized identity data points, including Twitter and GitHub accounts, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) participation and non-fungible token (NFT) ownership. RociFi relies on decentralized identity providers that use technology such as zero-knowledge proofs to only share pertinent user information.  Borrowers are assigned a non-fungible credit score (NFCS) ranging from 1 to 10 with lower scores representing lower risk. Users can burn the nontransferrable NFCS token and associated addresses at any time if they’re concerned about privacy or no longer want to use it.  “Undercollateralized capital markets represent one of the biggest opportunities to transform capital efficiency in crypto,” said Arrington Capital Partner Ninor Mansor in a press release. “The distinct lack of non-economic recourse in DeFi means other types of ‘social capital’ cannot be deployed by borrowers.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin edges up to $40,600 after U.S. CPI rose a new 40-year high in March.

And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Chris Giancarlo, senior counsel, Willkie Farr & Gallagher  Sasha Ivanov, founder and lead developer, Waves  Benoit Bosc, global head of product, GSR  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Editor's note: This newsletter was produced prior to the release of CPI data, which showed inflation rising a faster-than-expected 1.2% in March to an annual pace of 8.5%. The core rate, however, rose a less-than-expected 0.3% in March to an annual pace of 6.5%.  The crypto market was a sea of red early Tuesday as investors braced for a critical U.S. inflation report, which is expected to show the cost of living in the world's largest economy rose 8.3% year-over-year in March following February's 7.9% reading.  The core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is expected to have risen 6.6% from a year earlier after a 6.4% increase in February. The data is scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC.  On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the impending inflation report could show extraordinarily elevated price pressures, thanks to disruptions in energy and food markets caused by Russia's war on Ukraine.  A higher-than-expected number could bring additional selling pressure to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""Due to the Russia/Ukraine war, core inflation reading is key to watch out for, as this strips out gas and food, giving the Federal Reserve the green light to continue to hammer the market with aggressive policy,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said in an email.  The headline figure also matters, as higher food and energy costs can keep traditional investors from allocating money to risky assets.  ""With soaring inflation, retail investors do not have enough money to invest significant amounts in what they deem as 'risky' assets like cryptocurrencies,"" Sotiriou said.  Crypto funds have registered outflows ahead of the CPI release, perhaps fearing a strong hawkish reaction to a hotter-than-expected inflation data.  Data tracked by ByteTree shows the number of coins held by the U.S. and Canadian closed-ended funds and Canadian and European exchange-traded funds has dropped by over 5,776 BTC (worth $243 million) to 855,980 BTC.  There is still hope for the bulls from a technical analysis standpoint, as the total market capitalization remains above the Ichimoku cloud support.     Acceptance under the cloud would expose yearly lows near $1.5 trillion.  Monero shines  The privacy-focused Monero or XMR remained on bid, despite macro-induced weakness in the broader market.  The biggest privacy coin by market value traded at $240 at press time, representing a 10% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk data. The cryptocurrency was one of the top 10 best-performing cryptocurrencies of the past 30 days.  Investors seem to be having a relook at coins offering anonymity in the wake of heightened geopolitical uncertainty worldwide, according to Lux Thiagarajah, head of trading at BCB Group, a business-to-business provider of banking rails to crypto companies.  ""Monero's appeal lies in the fact that it is a privacy coin. Since Russia invaded Ukraine and the West sanctions imposed on Kremlin, privacy coins such as Monero and Zcash have benefitted,"" Thiagarajah said in a Twitter chat.  ""Greater focus was also placed on these privacy coins ever since President Joe Biden's executive order regarding cryptocurrencies. With greater scrutiny of cryptocurrencies by governments and the increased rhetoric around CBDCs (central bank digital currency),"" Thiagarajah added, saying that dip demand is likely to be strong if the market and political turmoil continues.

42395572,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxxoG,1649767568,US Inflation Jumps to Fresh 4-Decade High of 8.5% in March,"The U.S. Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index (CPI), a widely used metric to gauge rising costs of living, rose faster than expected in March to a four-decade high of 8.5% as supply-chain woes and the war in Ukraine pushed energy and food prices higher.  The headline CPI, which includes prices for all items basic for living such as food, housing, car, energy, consumer products, is now at its highest point since December 1981, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Analysts and economists had estimated an 8.4% inflation rate in March, according to the FactSet database.  Core inflation, which excludes seasonally volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3% compared with the prior month, which was slower than the 0.5% expected by analysts.  The CPI report is closely followed by bitcoin (BTC) investors because the largest cryptocurrency by market value is seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.  Investors had sold off risk assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies amid fear that a spike in inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to accelerate monetary tightening and rate hikes.  Bitcoin, which recently hit a record-high correlation with the Nasdaq 100 index, dipped below $40,000 Monday.  Bitcoin price  Bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $40,509 as of press time.  ""My take is that the Federal Reserve will see the new CPI numbers as a reinforcement to their plan in combating inflation,"" Prosper Trading Academy's Howard Greenberg said to CoinDesk.  ""If [Fed governor Lael] Brainard shows signs of confidence that rate hikes and quantitative tightening remain on same schedule as she previously announced, it could give retail and institutions the confidence needed to return to the markets, including cryptocurrencies."" Lael Brainard is scheduled to answer questions about inflation, interest rates and job market at 12:10 pm on Tuesday at the Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit.  Inflation in the U.S. was already at levels not seen in four decades, only to be exacerbated by supply chain disruptions and high energy prices last month because of Russia’s devastation in Ukraine.  Western countries led by the U.S. imposed wide-scale sanctions on Russian trade and banks after Russia, one of the globe’s largest exporters of commodities and natural resources, invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki warned Monday the Biden administration expected the March CPI headline inflation data to be “extraordinarily elevated” and blamed the war in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying the spike was “due to Putin’s price hike.”  The large gap between the headline and core inflation figures (8.5% vs. 6.5% through the last 12 months) can be explained by the accelerated rise in food and energy prices.  The energy index rose 32% over the last year, and the food index increased 8.8%, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending May 1981.  Some analysts argue that March was the top for inflation and will slow in the coming months, although rising costs of living is expected to stay.  ""Inflation likely peaked in March, with the biggest contributions coming from gasoline and food prices, which could stabilize in the next few months,"" Navy Federal Credit Union's corporate economist Robert Frick said. ""But high inflation will be with us at least through the summer because increases in other prices, especially shelter and services, will be sticky.""

42395570,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxxpF,1649764800,Financial Services Company DTCC Working With Digital Dollar Project on CBDC Prototype,"Weeks after U.S. President Joe Biden released an executive order directing the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to look into a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC), one of the nation's biggest financial services providers is building a prototype.  “Project Lithium,” a CBDC pilot from post-trade clearing and settlement firm Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is intended to explore the potential benefits of a CBDC and the value it could bring to the financial services industry, according to a DTCC press release Tuesday.  DTCC is working on the project in partnership with the Digital Dollar Project, the non-profit formed to advocate for a U.S. CBDC. Members include consulting firm Accenture (ACN), former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, former LabCFTC Director Daniel Gorfine and investor Charles Giancarlo. Back in May the organization announced it would be launching a number of pilot projects.  While many countries, including China, Sweden and South Korea, are already exploring or using a CBDC, the United States has been behind in testing a digital currency.  “This is an experimentation on whether or not a digitalized form of a central bank digital currency drives any additional value to the industry in the capital market space,” said Jennifer Peve, managing director and head of strategy and business development at DTCC.  The development of the prototype will likely finish this autumn, Peve told CoinDesk.  While a CBDC can serve multiple purposes, Project Lithium is particularly focused on the needs of the financial services industry, such as how a CBDC could benefit the clearing and settlement of securities. For example, the project aims to demonstrate direct, bilateral settlement of cash tokens in real-time delivery-versus-payment (DVP) settlement.  “It will maintain many of the existing elements of our currency today, so it’s effectively representing the U.S. dollar but in a digitalized form and on blockchain,” said Peve.  Other areas the pilot will attempt to identify are reduced counterparty risk and trapped liquidity, increased capital efficiency and a more efficient, automated workflow, according to the press release.  “There are different ways that this can take shape, and understanding those various methods or which ones make most sense for us and the industry and the country is very important,” Peve said.  DTCC controlled by big banks  DTCC traces its history back to a key milestone in the existing financial-market infrastructure – specifically the ""paperwork crisis"" of the early 1970s, brought on by a ""sharp increase in securities trading and the growing number of trades that fail to settle,"" according to its website.  The DTCC board of directors includes executives from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BNY Mellon and Northern Trust as well as the foreign banks UBS and BNP Paribas.  According to the DTCC board's charter, the ""board must be representative of DTCC's participant shareholders.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/12/financial-services-company-dtcc-working-with-digital-dollar-project-on-cbdc-prototype,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/963623de8b74f107ec08b2148b99ed7be59b6a40-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It was at this stage of the correction that the SAND price came. After the enchanting growth wave from October 2021, buyers can not start the second round. Basic buyer&apos;s support is in the range of $2.58. This is the third time this range has repelled an attack by sellers. The main problem is that each subsequent price rebound from the $2.58 range is weaker than the previous one. https://www.tradingview.com/x/KxjU5sSN/ And repeated tests of this range by sellers pass on consistently low volumes and without special problems from the point of view of buyers&apos; resistance. These facts lead us to consider the scenario of continuing the correction of the SAND price to the mark of $2.09. The fact is that below the mark of $2.58 are the stop orders of most buyers who bought in this price zone. It is on this liquidity that there is a chance to quickly buy SAND at a good price in bulk. Therefore, in the event of a breakdown of $2.58 at abnormally high volumes, we will expect a false breakdown with a sharp reversal of the price to $5.

Will the downtrend reach $300? Key technical points: The GNO prices plummeted 30% last fortnight. The market value plunged under the 200-day EMA. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of Gnosis is $19.84 Million, marking a 103% rise. Past Performance of GNO GNO coin price showcased a phenomenal bullish reversal rally starting from the $285 mark to the $478 level, accounting for a 66% growth in two weeks. However, the daily candles at $478 showcased higher price rejection due to increased supply, pushing prices under $500, resulting in long-wick formations.

Hence, the most likely possibility is a downtrend continuation to the $285 mark. The bullish aligned EMAs maintain a sideways trend surviving the bearish fall but might shortly undermine the bullish crossover of the 50 and 100-day EMA by regaining the bearish formation.

42395567,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxxlJ,1649761373,Morgan Stanley Says US Could Regulate Stablecoin Issuers Like Banks,"The U.S. Treasury Department and Congress are preparing regulation for stablecoin or crypto dollars issuers that could see them being regulated in a similar way to how the banks are regulated, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a recent research report.  President Joe Biden recently signed an executive order relating to the future of digital assets, with a focus on investigating a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  The U.S. administration is acknowledging the competition from foreign CBDCs in China and the eurozone, and sees the need to act with the highest urgency “for the U.S. dollar to remain the favored and dominant payment mechanism,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by Sheena Shah wrote. The Biden administration sees the regulation of the crypto markets as a way to manage the impact on U.S. dollar banking dominance, the note said.  Implications for the crypto markets could be far reaching as about 60% of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) exchanges are trades against a stablecoin, and stablecoin lending has become an important part of centralized and decentralized finance (DeFi), the note added. DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without needing any third parties.  Morgan Stanley said there is still regulatory uncertainty about whether stablecoins are securities, derivatives or commodities, noting that they are not currently widely used for business and consumer transactions.  If the U.S. government is serious about introducing a retail CBDC, it could potentially change the business models of banks and payment companies, the report said, and could also lower fees, it added.  The Wall Street bank expects progress on new U.S. crypto regulation to be slow, particularly ahead of U.S. midterm elections in November.

Key technical points: The QTUM price reached the $6 mark. The 50-day EMA brings consolidation fallout. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of QTUM is $111.57 Million, marking a 20% rise. Past Performance of QTUM QTUM coin price shows an expanding channel pattern in the daily chart with equally solid trendlines. The coin price shows a reversal from the triple bearish threat of the 200-day EMA, resistance trendline, and the $8.85 level. The retracement accounts for a 30% discount in the last two weeks, bringing the market value closer to $6. Source-Tradingview QTUM Technical Analysis QTUM coin prices showcased a consolidation phase below the 50-day EMA, closer to the $7 mark. Then, however, the increasing bearish influence over the crypto market kickstarts the downfall and hits the $6 mark. The bearish reversal overrides the bullish reversal observed in the 50 and 100-day EMA and leads to a flat trend. Hence, the possibility of bullish crossovers is lowered, and the EMAs again provide opposition to bullish growth. RSI Indicator: The RSI slope takes a big hit as it falls into the nearly oversold zone, and the 14-day average line shifts into the reverse gear and hits the halfway line.

42395576,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxxuA,1649757559,How Ichi Tokens Plunged 90% After Bad Debt Fiasco on Rari,"Ichi’s ICHI governance tokens have plunged some 90% in the past 24 hours after a series of cascading liquidations in its pool on yield-generating platform Rari, data shows.  “The Ichi Fuse Pool (#136) is currently experiencing bad debt due to cascading liquidations,” Rari said in a tweet late Monday. “This is a permissionless pool that is owned and operated by Ichi Foundation.”  The slump occurred as Rari's Fuse protocol automatically sold holdings in Pool 136 to support the pool's value. However, low liquidity for the token on decentralized exchanges (DEX) meant the price suddenly plunged, and the pool was drained. At the time of writing, the liquidity sits at $0 as the entire pool was wiped out as crypto prices declined Monday.  Understanding Rari and Ichi  Rari allows users to supply and borrow any asset in its Fuse pools to earn yields on their idle capital. Users can set up their own pools with a basket of Ethereum-based assets. Other users can deposit funds into those pools to earn yields. The yields are generated as rewards for trading activity on those liquidity pools.  Ichi allows crypto communities to mint stablecoins by backing each created token with $1 in value. For example, the oneBTC token created on Ichi was initially backed by equal amounts of USD coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged to U.S. dollars, and wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), with the WBTC share increasing as the underlying bitcoin (BTC) treasury grew in size.  Pool 136 on Rari consisted of such Ichi-issued assets. Data show some $124 million – spread over WBTC, oneBTC, ICHI and six other assets – was locked on the Fuse protocol.     Inside how ICHI fell 90%  Ichi, which set up Pool 136, set a collateral factor of 85% on ICHI and allowed hundreds of millions of dollars to be used as collateral. The collateral factor refers to the maximum amount of money that can be borrowed against supplied assets. That meant users supplying 100 ICHI as collateral could borrow at most 85 ICHI worth of other assets at any given time.  ""Liquidity was structured so the bulk of it sat just under market price, allowing the pool to absorb sells with minimal impact,"" explained Aswath Balakrishnan, vice president of research at Delphi Digital, in a Telegram message. ""There wasn't enough liquidity to absorb all the ICHI liquidations, causing the price to cascade.""  Rari developers pointed out the high collateral factor and lack of caps on supply contributed to the slide.  “A collateral factor of 85% is extremely high,” Rari developer Jack Longarzo wrote in a tweet. “Additionally, the team didn't use supply caps and allowed an infinite amount of $ICHI to be used as collateral. This allowed $ICHI holders to borrow extensively against uncapped collateral.”  “if you see collateral in a pool significantly in excess of what can be liquidated this is a red flag. Cascading liquidations can cause the price to decline quickly, dry up the liquidity, and leave the pool with bad debt,” he added.  The drop  ICHI traded at over $120 on Monday in early European hours. Data from CoinGecko show pool liquidations started around 12:30 UTC on Monday and continued until 2:30 UTC on Tuesday.  Prices dropped all the way to $12.50 and have since stabilized. Market capitalization reached $53 million at writing time from Monday’s $579 million.  Longarzo said Ichi developers could have taken several steps to cushion risks, such as increasing the liquidity in the market for ICHI when the drop began and putting a supply cap in place when the pool was created.  Ultimately, it was up to Ichi’s developers to ensure risks related to Pool 136 were contained.  “Fuse is a permissionless protocol. Pool operators are responsible for following best practices to avoid situations like this one,” Longarzo said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/12/how-ichi-tokens-plunged-90-after-bad-debt-fiasco-on-rari,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7280666b1d5ca9b277948572eefb2bb005c6489b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After testing the $ 0.1796 mark, buyers touched the middle line of the falling channel, in which the price has been moving since June 2021. We talked about the test of this mark and the price rebound in our previous scenario. The 4th week of the DOGE price growth ended with a clear hint of buyers&apos; weakness. Pay attention to the weekly candle from 4 April. For the last 4 weeks, this candle has been traded at the highest trading volumes. However, more effort was not given to buyers. https://www.tradingview.com/x/TKRiuGEg/ The weekly candle closed near the opening price and formed a pin-up. Thus, sellers declared themselves and restrained the aggression of buyers with limited orders. The trading week on 11 April began with a local reduction of the DOGE price. In just one day, sellers were able to absorb the two previous weekly candles of buyers. The DOGE price stopped in the range of $0.135. This is the main buyers&apos; support, which separates from the sharp price fall of DOGE to $0.1. Given the dynamics of the fall, the probability of maintaining the mark of $0.135 is not high enough. Our fears may be confirmed by a sluggish price rebound on a smaller timeframe from $0.135.

According to Psaki, the disparity between the two metrics would stem from an abnormal increase in gas prices last month. ""At times, gas prices were more than $1 above pre-invasion levels, so that roughly 25% increase in gas prices will drive [Tuesday's] inflation reading,"" Psaki said.  The White House's warning of a big bump in the headline CPI due to the volatile food and energy component is perhaps aimed at calming market nerves ahead of the data. Risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC), have come under pressure in the lead-up to the CPI release on fears that an above-8% reading would strengthen the case for faster rate hikes and balance sheet runoff by the Federal Reserve.  Last week, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said that ""bringing inflation down is of paramount importance."" Brainard struck a hawkish tone, favoring interest rate increases and a rapid balance sheet runoff to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year.  Psaki's comments perhaps indicate the White House expects the headline inflation to cool in the coming months, as the panic in the energy market has faded. Gas prices in the U.S. have pulled back to $4.11 per gallon from the record high of $4.33 per gallon hit on March 11, according to the American Automobile Association. West Texas Intermediate crude traded at $96 per barrel at press time, down 23% from the high of $123 seen a month ago, per charting platform TradingView. Energy prices had surged after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.  It remains to be seen if investors take cognizance of the White House's view and remain calm in case of an above-8% CPI print. A big miss on expectations could restore risk-on sentiment in markets.  That said, the jury is out on the returns of animal spirits in asset markets, given the growing consensus that the era of low inflation and cheap liquidity may be behind us.  ""We may be on the cusp of a new inflationary era,"" Agustín Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, said in a speech earlier this month. ""The forces behind high inflation could persist for some time. New pressures are emerging, not least from labor markets, as workers look to make up for inflation-induced reductions in real income.""  “It seems clear that policy rates need to rise to levels that are more appropriate for the higher inflation environment. ""Most likely, this will require real interest rates to rise above neutral levels for a time in order to moderate demand,"" Carstens added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/12/white-house-in-damage-control-mode-as-crypto-markets-brace-for-8-plus-inflation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56a673560565745abe767d1c789130bdb283838b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since they entered mainstream consciousness in 2021, they have been invariably associated with digital art. But NFTs have utility beyond the high-end art world. Digital collectibles are on the rise, with athletes especially interested in using NFTs to crystallize iconic moments in sports history. In the gaming world, many developers are working on incorporating NFTs in video games as playable items. Lastly, the greatest application of NFTs is yet to come in the metaverse.

Since then, NFTs have been a staple of mainstream culture, with digital artists increasingly using the technology as a way to directly interact with their clientele. But enough about art - what else are people doing with NFTs? Digital collectibles are perhaps the second best-known NFT product.

In an update posted on the project's Discord, co-founder Lorens Huculak said that ""after immediately undertaking a review of the allegations, we determined the actions to be in clear violation of our values and expectations, and we exited Neso immediately.""  When contacted by CoinDesk, Huculak did not go into further details regarding the allegations or say if he was aware of Neso's real identity, only pointing to an earlier statement on Discord that the company is fully remote and Neso was an anonymous developer.  Like many projects in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, some members of Gem's teams use pseudonyms, making any sort of due diligence or background checks difficult.  In January, the DeFi community behind the protocol Wonderland was rocked when it learned that ""Sifu,"" a core member of the founding team, was previously the co-founder of the infamous Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX.  Although Huculak refers to Neso as an anonymous developer, in a prior video interview with blockchain analytics platform Nansen, Neso is listed as a co-founder.

Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of KAVA is $98.03 Million, marking a 17.86% fall.

Traders racked up over $430 million in losses to liquidations, according to data from Coinglass.  Liquidations occur when an exchange closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices, as opposed to spot trading, where traders own the actual assets.  Longs, or positions of traders betting on upward prices, took the biggest hit and accounted for nearly 90%, or $386 million, of all losses in the past 24 hours. Shorts saw a relatively lower $44 million in losses.  Traders of bitcoin futures lost $156 million alone, followed by ether (ETH) futures at $102.85 million, and SOL futures, which track Solana’s native tokens, at $12.41 million. Futures Dogecoin’s DOGE and Stepn’s GMT notched up a combined $16 million in losses after a run last week.  Crypto exchange OKX notched up $149 million in liquidations, the largest among all crypto exchanges. Nearly 96%, or $143 million, were those stemming from long positions. Bitmex saw the highest liquidated value, however, with a single $10 million bitcoin position getting closed on the exchange.  The losses came as bitcoin lost 5.2% in the past 24 hours, data from CoinGecko shows. Ether declined by a similar percentage, while Solana’s SOL and Polkadot’s DOT tokens slid some 8%.  The drop in crypto markets came as recession fears mounted in the U.S. on Monday following hawkish comments by the U.S. Federal Reserve last week, which has since contributed to a slide in global markets.  Stocks and oil also slid on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrials closed at 1.19% lower, the S&P 500 dropped 1.69%, while technology-heavy Nasdaq slid even further at 2.18%.

The fund will be part of the new TIMES suite of products, short for Trust, Interest, Mining, Yield Earnings and Structured Solutions.  “The Ethereum Enhanced Portfolio is our first of such products, providing qualifying investors an opportunity to capitalize on Ethereum, the most renowned smart-contract platform, while enhancing risk-adjusted returns compared to holding Ethereum,” said Emma Hu, product partner of IDEG, in a statement.  The company didn’t disclose the size or how much has been already invested in the fund.  Coinbase Prime will be the fund’s prime broker and custodian, building on a relationship that started in 2019, said IDEG Chief Compliance Officer and COO Suen Son Poon.  This Ethereum fund is launching as digital asset vehicles aside from bitcoin (BTC) have been gaining traction among institutional investors thanks to offering further diversification within the volatile digital asset sector. Most recently, Goldman Sachs (GS) began offering interested clients access to an ether fund issued by Galaxy Digital.  Last week bitcoin-related products took the lion’s share of fund outflows with $131.8 million of redemptions, while funds focused on ether saw just $15.3 million in outflows, according to a CoinShares report.  The Ethereum Enhanced Portfolio fund will be available to qualified investors globally, except for the United States, with a minimum investment amount of $100,000, according to company spokesman Ian Stirling. “The majority of single-coin tracker funds on the market tend to be passive funds,” he added, noting that the fund will charge a fixed management fee based on the asset under management.
