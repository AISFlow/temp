42378665,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lIC1,1461421220,How the Blockchain Can Unshackle the World,"Jalak Jobanputra is founding partner of Future/Perfect Ventures, an early-stage venture capital fund in NYC.  In this piece, Jobanputra looks forward to the ways consumers might use blockchain in the future, while identifying three areas where its impact might be most immediately felt.  Once every 20 years or so, new technology comes to market that has the potential to change how we communicate, how we do business, and pushes the boundaries of everything we thought was possible.  In the 1970s, it was the personal computer; in the mid-1990s, the commercial Internet. Now, we are in the early stages of another major technological development called the blockchain.  The ""blockchain"" is a distributed consensus system that allows transactions, or other data, to be securely stored and verified without any centralized authority. All transactions are part of a chain, verified in blocks via different nodes in the network (hence… ""the blockchain"") – through mathematical algorithms which ensure that transactions cannot be tampered with once they are recorded. The transactions are stored on a global ledger (which is why the concept is often referred to as a distributed ledger).  While banks are currently testing out the technology for back-office functions, transactions on the blockchain don’t have to be financial; the data being transmitted doesn’t have to be money.  The system only needs a token (right now, bitcoin is the most popular one) that can carry transaction data through the network, and an incentive system in place to reward the nodes (right now, ""miners"") for utilizing their computing power to verify transactions.  Why is this important?  The graphics below display how I'm thinking about this technology fitting into a more general shift we are seeing from unconnected computing (personal computers), to distributed client/server/cloud computing (the era we are in now), to a peer-to-peer, decentralized model where machines, people and companies are directly connected without being routed through a central server or intermediaries.  The Internet of Things (IoT) cannot happen without peer-to-peer connections that can offload transactions from a single central pipe. Gartner forecasts 25 billion new sensors will be deployed between now and the end of this decade – many of these will require machine-to-machine microtransactions, involving data, software updates and potentially ""smart contracts"" (events that occur if something else happens – i.e., release of money from an account if a solar panel is utilized).  Three components of these transactions are interesting:  They are micropayments enabling a larger number of friction-free transactions  The amount of data created by this decentralized network will be staggering, and thus technologies such machine learning and cognitive computing become more important  Due to lower transaction costs, more people around the world will have access to goods and services that were previously out of reach.  Furthermore, data now truly becomes currency, and we will be able to transact with disparate data – akin to a ""digital barter"" system. Even more exciting, this new currency will be programmable – a concept which is now referred to as smart contracts.  You could look at our cell phones as nodes.  In the Internet of Things, a refrigerator can be a node. My smart watch can be a node, and I can also be a node. That's where I think the blockchain and identity become interesting for individuals. We carry all this information with us. The global ledger could allow every one of us to store our own data in a highly secure ""vault"".  We then will be able to decide which pieces of data we want to transact with. For example, right now every time we go to a new doctor’s office we have to write down all of our medical history. Imagine if your medical history, medications, and surgeries were all discrete pieces of data on a blockchain.  Then, you would be able to authenticate and send the data you wanted to transfer to different parties – whether it’s a new doctor, an insurance company, a research study or a relative. You would also have the security of knowing that the data could not be hacked (large health insurance company databases are a target for hackers, as health records command a premium on illicit sites).  Let’s look at three other ways we may use this technology in the future:  Finance  When assets exchange hands, it’s difficult to prove who owns what, especially when transactions are happening quickly.  This leads to outright failures in the system from improper accounting (similar to what happened to banks in 2008, when so many assets traded so quickly that no one could track the underlying integrity of those assets), or a need for a large amount of reserves, which ties up capital and makes it expensive for all of us to do business. Blockchain technology can address this.  The ledger records who owns what, and allows anyone access (with proper provisioning) to that one global database.  A bank or buyer can digitally ask the blockchain to make sure the other party owns what she says she does. This can happen near instantaneously. Now we will not have to pay extra overhead costs for all the people that double check records, and banks should theoretically charge lower fees.  Think about the billions of people around the world who don’t have bank accounts. When we apply for a loan in the US, we are assessed on our prior recorded financial history, and whether we have proven that we can responsibly pay back our lenders.  Over 2.5 billion people in the world are unbanked with no recorded financial history, a fact that severely restricts whether they are able to pay for their children’s education, expand their livelihood, or get through a rough crop year in the case of farmers.  Imagine if you could verify that person’s identity, their trustworthiness through a verified record that cannot be tampered with.  Think of the economic opportunity that will open up for individuals and businesses if they are able to access financial services such as savings accounts and loans. You would be more likely to do business with them if you could assess the true risk of lending to, or transacting with, them.  Real Estate  The average individual in the US will move 11 times in her lifetime.  Most buyers and sellers make use of escrow and title companies for third-party verification – to reduce risk of fraud (forgery of documents) and ensure the deal will go through. This escrow fee can be 1-2% of a home's value.  Title insurance is also huge industry: Read this eye-opening article documenting how ""title insurance in the US emerged in the 1870s as a way to protect buyers from dubious real estate deals"", and now the sector “enjoys a loss ratio of just 7% – for every $100 collected in premiums, it pays out just $7 in claims"".  By using the blockchain, to prove ownership, homeowners can transfer ownership without large fees.  A home’s data could also be on the blockchain – all repairs, chain of ownership, history of electricity, etc. – providing an immutable record of ownership so that a potential buyer has all information related to that home.  The more information a seller makes available the better price she may be able to negotiate for that transaction. This transparency and efficient market can create value for both the seller and buyer and can also incentivize owners to take better care of assets.  Art  The art market is one of the largest unregulated markets in the world.  Tens of millions of dollars are often transferred with little documentation. The current system makes it difficult to track the history of a piece of art, otherwise known as a work's provenance.  As a global public ledger, the blockchain can add more transparency in this market – every piece of art can be registered on the ledger and each exchange of the artwork, along with the value of that exchange, can be recorded.  Forgeries will not be possible, as the artwork’s initial authentication will serve as the immutable record. Right now, so much of art’s value is determined by a small group – the blockchain can remove this subjectivity as well as allow greater access to art as an investment for a larger number of people.  The Future  These examples are just a starting point. Just as we never envisioned a world where we would carry around fully connected supercomputers (smartphones) in our pockets a mere 20 years ago, we can’t even imagine all of the applications of the blockchain today.  But the fact that companies like Goldman Sachs, IBM, Cisco and institutions including the World Economic Forum, International Monetary Fund and Bank of England are experimenting with the technology, shows that this is not a flash in the pan concept. It is here to stay.  A blockchain-enabled world will be one that creates trust between transacting parties without the need to know them personally.  This is why the concept is often referred to as “trustless trust”. Our current system uses checks and balances at a cost to each of us. A blockchain world will not only allow faster, cheaper and truly global transactions, but will also allow each of us to control and track the distribution of our own data.  The combination of blockchain technology, machine learning, and development of relevant applications, can unlock unprecedented economic opportunity throughout the world.

42378656,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lI1x,1461418244,Why Blockchain Could Enable a True P2P Insurance Model,"Olivier Rikken is manager, public speaker and thought leader on digital disruption, blockchain and business process management at AXVECO, a boutique consultancy firm headquartered in Amsterdam.  In this opinion article, Rikken discusses how the insurance industry could persue a true peer-to-peer (p2p), crowdfunding model by leveraging blockchain technology.  There is a shift going on in the financial sector.  The steep rise of the FinTech industry, where investments went up eightfold in the past 5 years to almost $20bn is causing unrest within traditional companies. One of the most interesting developments in the FinTech industry is without a doubt blockchain.  There are already many examples of how blockchain could impact the banking industry, especially payments services and security and commodity trading. In the insurance industry it is Internet of Things, big data and crowdfunding that are widely described.  Perhaps because of this, the impact of blockchain on the insurance industry hasn't been a strong point of focus for new innovators. Some papers, like the Ethereum white paper and “Chain of a lifetime” do describe examples of new products that could result from blockchain technology, but these focus less on new possible business models.  But that's not to say there's no conversation on this topic. A report from the Dutch National Bank of March 2016 put sustainable future business models within the insurance branch on deep red. The urgency for new business models is high, although it looks like the sense of urgency is not always present within the traditional insurance companies.  There, the focus is more on incremental change of the current model instead of disruptive change or even green field set up of a new model.  Benefits to gain  So, what could be a new model and how could this model be executed? Blockchain, especially smart contracts, could be the enabler for a true P2P or crowdfunded insurance model.  In the new business model, the focus of the insurers would shift away from asset management and instead would focus on matching supply and demand and to risk calculation research. The insurer would provide a marketplace-like platform where customers can post their insurance demand, which could be either a standardized product or even a specific demand.  The insurer then would use its ""risk intelligence"" and risk models, based on their historical data, to perform a premium calculation to post the expected return, after subtracting their margin off course.  Posting this premium calculation, interested investors can bid or subscribe to the demanded insurance. This can either be done as a group through crowdfunding, or by individuals in a P2P way. This could depend on the kind of insurance request, the available resources of the investor and his or her risk appetite.  So far, this model looks much like the one Lloyd's already has in the insurance market or the ones companies like Funding Circle have set up in the P2P lending market.  And here is where blockchain will play a vital role.  Besides the administration being done in a decentralized ledger, with the use of smart contracts, one could guarantee the payment from the investor to the customer in case the event for which the customer posted their insurance demand happens. The smart contract is thus programmed as a traditional guarantee, but without the need of a bank.  By doing this in a blockchain, the administration and execution processes are simpler, almost fully automated, transparent and cheaper than in a traditional set up. Besides that, the investors know their maximum exposure as the amount defined in the smart contract.  The insurer can also fulfill the role of assessor of the damage to verify the validity of the insurance claim. But this could as easily be outsourced to a third party and by connecting the blockchain to other ledgers. This validation can then be verified automatically.  In this model, the use of smart contracts in the insurance market would not have to be limited to the example of P2P types of insurance, but could virtually be used for all kinds of insurance. Especially if one will be able to pool the amounts individual investors are willing to invest in the crowdfunding model to minimize the impact per investor in case of a major event happening.  Dividing essential tasks  This new business model has benefits for all parties involved, the insurers, the investors and of course the customers.  By acting as the provider of the marketplace and the risk intelligence, insurers gain a number of benefits. The capital needed to insure the customers remains at the investors, so the insurer, in turn, can operate with minimal levels of capital or even become completely capital-free.  With regards to regulatory licenses, similar models in the P2P lending business don't need a full license or even a license at all, just an exception from the regulators. As for the development of the platform, this could (and should) be outsourced to a third party on a pay-per-use basis, making the company even more ""capital agile"".  The end result could be a very lean, agile and cost-efficient organization.  On the investors side, this brings a new opportunity for investments in leaner organizations, and as a result, the potential for higher returns. Private investors with less to spare could also join the market, and there will be clear insight into the maximum financial risk exposure for investors.  Finally, for the customers, because there would be multiple investors bidding and subscribing and low operational costs, the insurance can be cheaper.      This model could give the customer the possibility to post demand for very specific insurances in an easy way, and the payment of the insurance can be guaranteed due to the smart contracts.  Potential roadblocks  Of course, there are various challenges in this model, some of the most urgent would be whether regulators allow the market to operate with these new efficiencies.  Insurers also need to create critical mass on the investor side in order to spread risk in case of larger payments to customers, and flexibility would be needed on the demand side in the case of very specific insurances.  With regards to the risk calculation, due to the nature of very specific insurances, an insurer would need to have the right capability to make a risk-return calculation that is attractive to both customer and investor.  Customers would play a vital role as well, as they would need to put their trust in a system in which there is no third party with capital reserves.  But, all in all this business model could be very interesting, and it could bring multiple benefits, creating a true P2P, crowdfunded insurer. One can even argue that, should this model develop fully, we might no longer have a traditional insurer, but instead, an intelligent capital trading house that fulfills this essential market role.
