42426867,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxJxh,1462996945,Why Silvergate’s CEO is Banking 15 Bitcoin Companies,"Startups focused on products and services based on bitcoin have never had an easy time opening bank accounts – or maintaining positive relationships with those firms.  The problem? Bitcoin-related clients are frequently viewed as high-risk by banking institutions, and thus far few banks have shown an interest in going through the process of mitigating that risk.  This is a long-standing issue that has sparked controversy in the past, but given the broader issue of de-risking by banks worldwide, it's perhaps unsurprising that bitcoin startups would find themselves in the crosshairs of bank compliance departments.  Yet those risks haven't kept every bank from opening its doors to bitcoin startups. Silvergate Bank, based in La Jolla, California, was one of the earliest institutions to buck that trend.  Silvergate is on the verge of opening its sixteenth bitcoin bank account, and its chief executive officer, Alan Lane, says the benefits of his bank's early adopter status might be in jeopardy.  Lane told CoinDesk:  ""If other banks are shying away from this, it probably wouldn’t be that difficult to generate business if they could create a compliance process that worked.""  The process of developing this kind of more inclusive compliance process – and as a result helping to ease concerns over the perceived risk of bitcoin businesses – began in 2013, according to Lane, who previously oversaw Silvergate’s manufacturing and retail accounts, ranging in size from $10m to $50m in annual revenue.  Buy some bitcoin  Lane, who calls himself a ""Joe-six-pack kind of guy"" as opposed to a coder, was originally only interested in bitcoin on a personal level.  He made his first bitcoin purchase using Coinbase in mid-2013, looking to enable an ACH transfer and learn more about the process of actually obtaining and using a digital currency.  That research allowed him, he explained in interview, to trace the transaction backwards to Silicon Valley Bank, one of the first institutions to bank with bitcoin.  Seeing that Silicon Valley Bank – known for its forward-looking stance on technology – was involved in bitcoin revealed the positive potential for doing business with those kinds of startups, he said.  By the end of 2013, Silvergate had received its first referral for a bitcoin client. In the middle of the following year, the bank was in conversations with ""several"" bitcoin clients, all of whom wanted to open accounts, explained Lane.  But thorny questions lingered. For example, were those bitcoin clients too risky? Would the cost of opening accounts and on-boarding them into the bank pay off in the end?  Finding answers  Despite the perceived uncertainty in doing business with bitcoin startups, Lane said that the regulations related to that process are actually quite clear.  To help answer those lingering questions, Lane set up a bitcoin working group composed of five Silvergate employees and tasked them with learning what the bank would need to do to accept bitcoin accounts.  ""It was a matter of starting to read the appropriate rules and regulations,"" said Lane. ""And along the way continuing a dialogue with the companies we had started talking with.""  Perhaps surprisingly, a large part of the due diligence for opening an account for a typical bitcoin company isn't that much more demanding than a non-bitcoin company, Lane explained. Most of that research, including on-site visits to those startups' offices “to make sure they are who they say they are,” is standard for corporate clients.  The regulatory requirements Silvergate follows don’t dictate that the bank audit every transaction, but according to Lane, that ""we have confidence that you have confidence"" in who are the account holder’s clients. An analysis of the potential client's customer verification process — how the company confirms its own clients identities — is good enough, he said.  Complications arise with companies requiring additional licenses, such as money-transmitting firms. Before Silvergate started accepting bitcoin startups, Lane explained, the bank didn't work with those kinds of companies.  ""This is where Silvergate had to evolve our compliance view of things,"" he said.  The roll-out  In August 2014, Lane officially informed the bank’s annual auditors it was exploring business opportunities with bitcoin startups. From there, a joint meeting was held with representatives from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the California State Banking Department to help ensure compliance.  In total, Lane estimated that, based on the salaries paid to each of the five working group members who developed Silvergate's bitcoin strategy on a part-time basis over 18 months, the bank has invested about $250k to learn what it would take to open its first bitcoin account.  Currently, Silvergate has 15 bank accounts open for bitcoin companies that include Palo Alto, California-based bitcoin vault Xapo and another ""half-dozen"" clients in varying stages of the due diligence process. Silvergate is not currently sharing the names of its other clients, which typically begin with a basic account, that receive more advanced features later.  A well prepared bitcoin firm that has answers to all Silvergate's questions can get an account in between 30 days and 60 days, he explained.  Problems remain  Despite these positive signs from one bank, the reality is that most bitcoin startups face considerable hurdles. The troubles seen in countries like Australia further illustrate this problem.  A recent report from the non-profit advocacy group Coin Center highlighted that lack of access to bank accounts for bitcoin startups as having a ""devastating"" impact. The average time to on-board a digital currency company is between 6 months and one year, according to Coin Center's findings – assuming the account is given in the first place.  In interview, Lane expressed concern that the banking industry's move towards describing some bitcoin companies as blockchain companies could stymie the benefits he’d hope Silvergate would achieve by being an early mover.  Instead of seeing a flood of new bitcoin businesses, the application rate is plateauing, he said. And he warned that the perception that blockchain companies were “less toxic” than bitcoin companies was likely not a trend that would continue.  ""For those who are really dealing with bitcoin and calling it blockchain, that’s short sighted,"" he said. ""All of a sudden, their banks are going to wake up and they’re going to get their bank account shut down.""  Lane went on to conclude:  ""Even if you think you're focusing more on blockchain it might still behoove you to try to find a bank that is willing to bank bitcoin companies so you can take that worry away.""

42426878,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxKHh,1462976131,State of Blockchain Q1 2016: Blockchain Funding Overtakes Bitcoin,"CoinDesk’s Q1 2016 State of Blockchain report summarizes key trends, data and events from the first quarter of 2016.  This article highlights a few of the 100 new slides from the report, which is freely available to view in full here. For more of our quarterly and annual reports, visit CoinDesk Research.    State of Blockchain Q1 2016 from CoinDesk    As blockchain hype begins to subside and entrepreneurs and organizations get down to the business of implementation and execution, a new debate has emerged over timing.  Splitting industry observers is a key question – Are we just short distance (1-2 years) away from witnessing the radical, transformative effects of blockchain technology? Or is five to 10 years a more realistic timeframe before blockchain technology fully matures and achieves wide adoption?  Nearly two-and-a-half years have now passed since Marc Andreessen penned a widely referenced New York Times op-ed about how bitcoin reminded him of the Internet circa 1993. His forecast suggested that it would be only a few short years before the blockchain-equivalent of Web 1.0 world-beating companies like Cisco would emerge.  In contrast, a string of voices, ranging from author and consultant Chris Skinner to financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley, have suggested that blockchain maturity and adoption is likely to take much longer than Andreessen's forecast.  In other words (and to stay with the Internet analogy), the skeptics would say blockchain adoption is actually closer to 1970s-80s Internet time, when foundational protocols like TCP/IP were invented, rather early-1990s Internet time.  Who's correct in this debate remains to be seen, but the stakes are incredibly high for an industry with over $1bn in venture capital investment.  Amidst this backdrop, we review some key trends from the quarter that was:  Venture bounce back  As of Q1 2016, total venture capital investment in bitcoin and blockchain startups now exceeds $1.1bn.  Perhaps more importantly, Q1 saw a sharp reversal in the multi-quarter downward investment trend, with both total investment and average deal size rebounding in the early months of the new year (Slide 15).  These investment results for the bitcoin and blockchain industry are all the more impressive given the ongoing softening observed in overall venture investment. The strong investment interest that is being shown in blockchain tech is largely responsible for the industry bucking this trend.  Investors go blockchain  The major industry story for 2015 was the increasing focus on the underlying technology of the bitcoin currency, which is commonly referred to as blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT).  This trend carried over into the first quarter of 2016 with a further increase in the number of traditional institutions that announced some form of blockchain initiative (Slide 83).  As we have noted, however, there is much confusion over the term ""blockchain"", and this confusion has led to frustration for both those new to the technology as well as amongst more fluent observers who will often see different terms used to express the same basic idea or principle.  In the report, we have therefore chosen to devote several slides to presenting a taxonomy and conceptual framework that will hopefully help clarify some of the basic blockchain differences and similarities.  To begin, we differentiate between bitcoin startups, which are defined as any cryptocurrency startup that focuses on payments, exchange trading, remittances or any other ‘currency’ activity, and blockchain startups, which focus on ‘non-currency’ activities such as securities settlement, property title, asset provenance, etc. (hybrid startups do both) (Slide 19).  There are now four times as many blockchain/hybrid startups than there were last year, and the first quarter of 2016 was the first time blockchain and hybrid startups raised more money than bitcoin startups (Slide 21).  It is also worth noting that twice as many blockchain/hybrid startup investment rounds were completed in Q1 as were completed for bitcoin startups.  In short, the industry's pivot toward blockchain is well underway.  The blockchain Rorschach test  Blockchain technology in some ways resembles a Rorschach test, a psychoanalytical tool developed in the 1920s where a person describes what a symmetrical series of ink blots suggests or resembles from their own perspective. When looking at the same ink-blot figure, different people will often report seeing very different things.  Similarly, when some people look at blockchain technology they see an open, permissionless system for achieving consensus and maintaining a shared public ledger. In contrast, when others look at blockchain technology they see a tool for providing a permissioned, semi- or fully-private access database.  While considerable debate has emerged over the merits and prospects of public (or open) and private (or permissioned) blockchains (Slide 7), the ability and flexibility of blockchain technology to serve many different purposes is one of its most powerful qualities.  What has been less frequently discussed are the differences between blockchain platforms and blockchain software.  Blockchain platforms are similar to other technology platforms, like iOS, Facebook, etc, in that they enable outside developers to build applications on top of the platform, typically through open APIs, software developer toolkits (SDKs) and standardized protocols.  Ethereum and bitcoin are representative of public blockchain platforms, while companies such as Ripple and Blockstream are representative of private blockchain platforms (Slide 10).  In contrast, blockchain software providers more closely resemble companies like Oracle, which provide software packages that are often designed to be used internally or have more restrictive parameters to prevent outside developer access.  The blockchain company Chain has been typically held up as an example of a private blockchain software provider, although the company’s recent announcement that it had built a permissioned protocol in collaboration with 10 firms suggests it is attempting to transition into a platform.  While the conventional wisdom among Silicon Valley venture capitalists and others is that businesses that can successfully become platforms represent the ideal investment, the purpose of distinguishing between blockchain platforms and software providers is not to cast judgment on the merits of the various blockchain business models.  Indeed, it is likely that significant success can be achieved in any of the four platform/software quadrants. Instead, the distinction drawn in Slide 10 allows us to observe where blockchain initiatives are concentrating.  The two most crowded areas of the blockchain matrix appear to be the public platform and private software quadrants. For example, there are literally hundreds of public blockchains, represented by altcoins.  It should further be noted that the above depiction is not static. While private blockchain initiatives like R3 and Digital Asset Holdings may provide stand-alone software to their partners, both have achieved early critical mass and may ultimately become platforms.  Blockchain in advanced economies  Some early geographic areas of concentration can be observed in the distribution of blockchain venture investment and partnering.  As with bitcoin investment, the US continues to dominate blockchain investment, with the total amount invested to date in the US roughly split 50/50 between bitcoin and blockchain and hybrid startups.  Other countries showing early leadership in attracting blockchain investment include the UK, Israel, Sweden, Germany and Argentina, which is the lone developing economy to have attracted any significant blockchain venture investment (Slide 17).  In Q4 2015 blockchain news was largely dominated by R3CEV, which to date has attracted over 40 major banks and financial institutions as partners.  However, R3’s early lead in building an impressive consortium of systemically-important financial institutions does not appear to have had a negative impact on the ability of other blockchain initiatives, such as the Hyperledger Project and Digital Asset Holdings, to attract a similarly impressive group of partners and investors (Slide 88).  The rise of Ethereum  Akin to 2015 being the year of blockchain, Q1 2016 was arguably Ethereum's breakthrough quarter in terms of broader awareness.  In contrast to bitcoin, DLT's much touted 'killer app' – smart contracts – run natively on Ethereum. This feature, combined with an absence of the stagnation witnessed in bitcoin development (more on this later), has resulted in a number of high-profile wins for the Ethereum community, including integration of certain providers into Microsoft's Azure platform and many high-profile trials of Ethereum by UBS, R3 et al.  In response to these positive developments, the value of ether (Ethereum’s native token) rocketed upwards against bitcoin by over 1,300% in Q1 (Slide 61).  Bitcoin price volatility subsides  On a peak-to-trough basis, bitcoin’s price had one of its least volatile quarters in the past two years (Slide 52).  However, as discussed previously, lower bitcoin price volatility is not necessarily a positive trait.  Bitcoin was the top performing currency in 2015, but so far in 2016 has lagged other currencies. The price of bitcoin has also lagged behind a basket of publicly traded FinTech companies while showing relatively moderate-to-low price correlation with FinTech stocks (0.38).  Positive bitcoin price developments in Q1 include progress on scaling transaction throughput and the approaching July 2016 halving of the new block mining reward.  However, these positives have been countered by clear enthusiasm shown for bitcoin alternatives (namely Ethereum and non-currency uses of blockchain technology), a relatively stable macroeconomic environment, and (most importantly) the lack of a mainstream bitcoin ""killer app"".  Overall, bitcoin’s price struggled to achieve much momentum in either direction amid a mixture of bullish and bearish forces.  Politics of open source  Ethereum’s recent progress amid bitcoin’s ongoing political challenges highlights the possible importance of founders to open-source innovation and governance.  Satoshi Nakomoto’s transition many years ago to ""absentee landlord"" status (Satoshi is estimated to own approximately 1m BTC) has long been viewed positively as it created space for the emergence of other talented software developers and entrepreneurs who could bring fresh ideas to bitcoin and feel a sense of ownership in the project.  Satoshi’s disappearance also lent bitcoin a degree of mystique that captured the imagination and generated unprecedented (for an alternative currency, at least) media interest.  However, it has not been lost on observers that other open-source initiatives whose founders have remained active have not suffered anything like bitcoin’s current political gridlock (Slide 63).  Indeed, the recent speculation and debate surrounding Craig Wright’s role in the creation of bitcoin has been accompanied by statements from Craig and others over the current block size debate.

42426860,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxJph,1462971306,Four Genuine Blockchain Use Cases,"Dr Gideon Greenspan is the founder and CEO of Coin Sciences, the company behind the MultiChain platform for private blockchains.  In this opinion piece, Greenspan outlines four use cases for permissioned blockchains, arguing that financial institutions may face more limitations in trying to harness the technology than previously thought.  Almost a year after first releasing MultiChain, we've learned a huge amount about how blockchains, in a private and non-cryptocurrency sense, can and cannot be applied to real-world problems.  Allow me to share what we know so far.  To begin with, the first idea that we (and many others) started with, appears to be wrong. This idea, inspired by bitcoin directly, was that private blockchains (or ""shared ledgers"") could be used to directly settle the majority of payment and exchange transactions in the finance sector, using on-chain tokens to represent cash, stocks, bonds and more.  This is perfectly workable on a technical level, so what’s the problem?  In a word – confidentiality. If multiple institutions are using a shared ledger, then every institution sees every transaction on that ledger, even if they don’t immediately know the real-world identities of the parties involved.  This turns out to be a huge issue, both in terms of regulation and the commercial realities of inter-bank competition. While various strategies are available or in-development for mitigating this problem, none can match the simplicity and efficiency of a centralized database managed by a trusted intermediary, which maintains full control over who can see what.  For now, at least, it seems that large financial institutions prefer to keep most transactions hidden in these intermediary databases, despite the costs involved.  I base this conclusion not only on our own experience, but also on the direction taken by several prominent startups whose initial goal was to develop shared ledgers for banks. For example, both R3CEV and Digital Asset are now working on ""contract description languages”, in Corda and DAML respectively (earlier examples include MLFihttps://www.lexifi.com/product/technology/contract-description-language and Ricardian Contracts).  These languages allow the conditions of a complex financial contract to be represented formally and unambiguously in a computer readable format, while avoiding the shortcomings of Ethereum-style general purpose computation. Instead, the blockchain plays only a supporting role, storing or notarizing the contracts in encrypted form, and performing some basic duplicate detection.  The actual contract execution does not take place on the blockchain – rather, it is performed only by the contract’s counterparties, with the likely addition of auditors and regulators.  In the near term, this is probably the best that can be done, but where does it leave the broader ambitions for permissioned blockchains? Are there other applications for which they can form a more significant part of the puzzle?  This question can be approached both theoretically and empirically.  Theoretically, by focusing on the key differences between blockchains and traditional databases, and how these inform the set of possible use cases. And in our case, empirically, by categorizing the real-world solutions being built on our product today.  Not surprisingly, whether we focus on theory or practice, the same classes of use case arise:  Interorganizational recordkeeping  Lightweight financial systems  Multiparty aggregation  Provenance tracking.  Theory  Before explaining these in detail, let’s recap the theory. As I’ve discussed before, the two most important differences between blockchains and centralized databases can be characterized as follows:  Disintermediation. Blockchains enable multiple parties who do not fully trust each other to safely and directly share a single database without requiring a trusted intermediary.  Confidentiality. All participants in a blockchain see all of the transactions taking place. (Even if we use pseudonymous addresses and advanced cryptography to hide some aspects of those transactions, a blockchain will always leak more information than a centralized database).  In other words, blockchains are ideal for shared databases in which every user is able to read everything, but no single user controls who can write what. By contrast, in traditional databases, a single entity exerts control over all read and write operations, while other users are entirely subject to that entity’s whims.  To sum it up in one sentence: Blockchains represent a trade-off in which disintermediation is gained at the cost of confidentiality.  In examining the four types of use case below, we’ll repeatedly come back to this core trade-off, explaining why, in each case, the benefit of disintermediation outweighs the cost of reduced confidentiality.  Lightweight financial systems  Let’s start with the class of blockchain applications that will be most familiar, in which a group of entities wishes to set up a financial system. Within this system, one or more scarce assets are transacted and exchanged between those entities.  In order for any asset to remain scarce, two related problems must be solved. First, we must ensure that the same unit of the asset cannot be sent to more than one place (a ""double spend""). Second, it must be impossible for anyone to create new units of the asset on a whim (""forgery""). Any entity which could do either of these things could steal unlimited value from the system.  A common solution to these problems is physical tokens, such as metal coins or securely printed paper. These tokens trivially solve the problem of double spending, because the rules of physics (literally) prevent one token from being in two places at the same time.  The problem of forgery is solved by making the token extremely difficult to manufacture. Still, physical tokens suffer from several shortcomings which can render them impractical:  As pure bearer assets, physical tokens can be stolen with no recourse  It is hard and expensive to create physical tokens that can't be forged  They are slow and costly to move in large numbers or over distances.  These shortcomings can be avoided by leaving physical tokens behind, and redefining asset ownership in terms of a ledger managed by a trusted intermediary. In the past, these ledgers were based on paper records, and today they tend to run on regular databases. Either way, the intermediary enacts a transfer of ownership by modifying the ledger’s content, in response to an authenticated request. Unlike settlement with physical tokens, questionable transactions can quickly and easily be reversed.  So what’s the problem with ledgers? In a nutshell, concentration of control.  By putting so much power in one place, we create a significant security challenge, in both technical and human terms. If someone external can hack into the database, they can change the ledger at will, stealing funds or destroying its contents completely.  Even worse, someone on the inside could corrupt the ledger, and this kind of attack is hard to detect or prove. As a result, wherever we have a centralized ledger, we must invest significant time and money in mechanisms to maintain that ledger's integrity. And in many cases, we require ongoing verification using batch-based reconciliation between the central ledger and those of each of the transacting parties.  Enter the blockchain (or ""shared ledger""). This provides the benefits of ledgers without suffering from the problem of concentration.  Instead, each entity runs a “node” holding a copy of the ledger and maintains full control over its own assets, which are protected by private keys. Transactions propagate between nodes in a peer-to-peer fashion, with the blockchain ensuring that consensus is maintained.  This architecture leaves no central attack point through which a hacker or insider could corrupt the ledger’s contents. As a result, a digital financial system can be deployed more quickly and cheaply, with the added benefit of automatic reconciliation in real time.  So what’s the downside? As discussed earlier, all participants in a shared ledger see all of the transactions taking place, rendering it unusable in situations where confidentiality is required. Instead, blockchains are suitable for what I call lightweight financial systems, namely those in which the economic stakes or number of participants is relatively low.  In these cases, confidentiality tends to be less of an issue – even if the participants pay close attention to what each other are doing, they won’t learn much of value. And it is precisely because the stakes are low that we prefer to avoid the hassle and cost of setting up an intermediary.  Some obvious examples of lightweight financial systems include: crowdfunding, gift cards, loyalty points and local currencies – especially in cases where assets are redeemable in more than one place.  But we are also seeing use cases in the mainstream finance sector, such as peer-to-peer trading between asset managers who are not in direct competition. Blockchains are even being tested as internal accounting systems, in large organizations where each department or location must maintain control of its funds.  In all these cases, the lower cost and friction of blockchains provides an immediate benefit, while the loss of confidentiality is not a concern.  Provenance tracking  Here’s a second class of use case that we repeatedly hear from MultiChain’s users: tracking the origin and movement of high-value items across a supply chain, such as luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and electronics. And equally, critical items of documentation such as bills of lading or letters of credit.  In supply chains, stretching across time and distance, all of these items suffer from counterfeiting and theft.  The problem can be addressed using blockchains in the following way: when the high-value item is created, a corresponding digital token is issued by a trusted entity, which acts to authenticate its point of origin. Then, every time the physical item changes hands, the digital token is moved in parallel, so that the real-world chain of custody is precisely mirrored by a chain of transactions on the blockchain.  If you like, the token is acting as a virtual ""certificate of authenticity"", which is far harder to steal or forge than a piece of paper.  Upon receiving the digital token, the final recipient of the physical item, whether a bank, distributor, retailer or customer, can verify the chain of custody all the way back to the point of origin. Indeed, in the case of documentation such as bills of lading, we can do away with the physical item altogether.  While all of this makes sense, the astute reader will notice that a regular database, managed (say) by an item’s manufacturer, can accomplish the same task. This database would store a record of the current owner of each item, accepting signed transactions representing each change of ownership, and respond to incoming requests regarding the current state of play.  So why use a blockchain instead? The answer is that, for this type of application, there’s a benefit to distributed trust.  No matter where a centralized database is held, there will be people in that place who have the ability (and can be bribed) to corrupt its contents, marking forged or stolen items as legitimate. By contrast, if provenance is tracked on a blockchain belonging collectively to a supply chain’s participants, no individual entity or small group of entities can corrupt the chain of custody, and end users can have more confidence in the answers they receive.  As a bonus, different tokens (say for some goods and the corresponding bill of lading) can be safely and directly exchanged, with a two-way swap guaranteed at the lowest blockchain level.  What about the problem of confidentiality? The suitability of blockchains for supply chain provenance is a happy result of this application’s simple pattern of transactions. In contrast to financial marketplaces, most tokens move in a single direction, from origin to endpoint, without being repeatedly traded back-and-forth between the blockchain’s participants.  If competitors rarely transact with each other (e.g., toy manufacturer to toy manufacturer, or retailer to retailer), they cannot learn each others’ blockchain ""addresses"" and connect those to real-world identities.  Furthermore, the activity can be easily partitioned into multiple ledgers, each representing a different order or type of good.  Inter-organizational recordkeeping  Both of the previous use cases are based on tokenized assets, i.e. on-chain representations of an item of value transferred between participants.  However, there is a second group of blockchain use cases that is not related to assets. Instead, the blockchain acts as a mechanism for collectively recording and notarizing any type of data, the meaning of which can be financial or otherwise.  One such example is an audit trail of critical communications between two or more organizations, say in the healthcare or legal sectors. No individual organization in the group can be trusted with maintaining this archive of records, because falsified or deleted information would significantly damage the others. Nonetheless, it is vital that all agree on the archive’s contents in order to prevent disputes.  To solve this problem, we need a shared database into which all of the records are written, with each record accompanied by a timestamp and proof of origin. The standard solution would be to create a trusted intermediary, whose role is to collect and store the records centrally.  But blockchains offer a different approach. They give the organizations a way to jointly manage this archive, while preventing individual participants (or small groups thereof) from corrupting it.  One of the most enlightening conversations I’ve had in the past two years was with Michael Mainelli of Z/Yen. For 20 years, his company has been building systems in which multiple entities collectively manage a shared digital audit trail, using timestamping, digital signatures and a round-robin consensus scheme.  As he explained the technical details of these systems, it became clear that they are permissioned blockchains in every respect. In other words, there is nothing new about using a blockchain for interorganizational recordkeeping – it’s just that the world has finally become aware of the possibility.  In terms of the actual data stored on the blockchain, there are three popular options:  Unencrypted data. This can be read by every participant in the blockchain, providing full collective transparency and immediate resolution in the case of a dispute.  Encrypted data. This can only be read by participants with the appropriate decryption key. In the event of a dispute, anyone can reveal this key to a trusted authority such as a court, and use the blockchain to prove that the original data was added by a certain party at a certain point in time.  Hashed data. A ""hash"" acts as a compact digital fingerprint, representing a commitment to a particular piece of data while keeping that data hidden. Given some data, any party can easily confirm if it matches a given hash, but inferring data from its hash is computationally impossible. Only the hash is placed on the blockchain, with the original data stored off-chain by interested parties, who can reveal it in case of a dispute.  As mentioned earlier, R3CEV’s Corda product has adopted this third approach, storing hashes on a blockchain to notarize contracts between counterparties, without revealing their contents. This method can be used both for computer-readable contract descriptions, as well as PDF files containing paper documentation.  Naturally, confidentiality is not an issue for interorganizational recordkeeping, because the entire purpose is to create a shared archive that all the participants can see (even if some data is encrypted or hashed). Indeed in some cases a blockchain can help manage access to confidential off-chain data, by providing an immutable record of digitally signed access requests.  Either way, the straightforward benefit of disintermediation is that no additional entity must be created and trusted to maintain this record.  Multiparty aggregation  Technically speaking, this final class of use case is similar to the previous one, in that multiple parties are writing data to a collectively managed record. But, in this case the motivation is different – to overcome the infrastructural difficulty of combining information from a large number of separate sources.  Imagine two banks with internal databases of customer identity verifications. At some point, they notice that they share a lot of customers, so they enter a reciprocal sharing arrangement in which they exchange verification data to avoid duplicated work.  Technically, the agreement is implemented using standard master–slave data replication, in which each bank maintains a live read-only copy of the other’s database, and runs queries in parallel against its own database and the replica. So far, so good.  Now, imagine these two banks invite three others to participate in this circle of sharing. Each of the five banks runs its own master database, along with four read-only replicas of the others. With five masters and 20 replicas, we have 25 database instances in total.  While doable, this consumes noticeable time and resources in each bank’s IT department.  Fast forward to the point where 20 banks are sharing information in this way, and we’re looking at 400 database instances in total. For 100 banks, we reach 10,000 instances. In general, if every party is sharing information with every other, the total number of database instances grows with the square of the number of participants. At some point in this process, the system is bound to break down.  So what’s the solution? One obvious option is for all of the banks to submit their data to a trusted intermediary, whose job is to aggregate that data in a single master database. Each bank could then query this database remotely, or run a local read-only replica within its own four walls.  While there’s nothing wrong with this approach, blockchains offer a cheaper alternative, in which the shared database is run directly by the banks which use it. Blockchains also bring the added benefit of redundancy and failover for the system as a whole.  It’s important to clarify that a blockchain is not acting just as a distributed database like Cassandra or RethinkDB. Unlike these systems, each blockchain node enforces a set of rules which prevent one participant from modifying or deleting the data added by another.  Indeed, there still appears to be some confusion about this – one recently released blockchain platform can be broken by a single misbehaving node. In any event, a good platform will also make it easy to manage networks with thousands of nodes, joining and leaving at will, if granted the appropriate permissions.  Although I’m a little skeptical of the oft-cited connection between blockchains and the Internet of Things, I think this might be where a strong such synergy lies. Of course, each ""thing"" would be too small to store a full copy of the blockchain locally. Rather, it would transmit data-bearing transactions to a distributed network of blockchain nodes, who would collate it all together for further retrieval and analysis.  Conclusion: Blockchains in Finance  I started this piece by questioning the initial use case envisioned for blockchains in the finance sector, namely the bulk settlement of payment and exchange transactions.  While I believe this conclusion is becoming common wisdom (with one notable exception), it does not mean that blockchains have no other applications in this industry. In fact, for each of the four classes of use case outlined above, we see clear applications for banks and other financial institutions. Respectively, these are: small trading circles, provenance for trade finance, bilateral contract notarization and the aggregation of AML/KYC data.  The key thing to understand is that, architecturally, our four classes of use case are not specific to finance, and are equally relevant to other sectors such as insurance, healthcare, distribution, manufacturing and IT.  Indeed, private blockchains should be considered for any situation in which two or more organizations need a shared view of reality, and that view does not originate from a single source.  In these cases, blockchains offer an alternative to the need for a trusted intermediary, leading to significant savings in hassle and cost.
