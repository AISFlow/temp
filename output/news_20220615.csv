29576,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=238737,1655335852,Here’s Why the Crypto Market is Still Vulnerable to Stagflation,"The crypto market has acquired significant momentum during the past decade as major brands and new users enter the digital industry. Despite being a stable and reliable system, cryptocurrencies have faced tough times but have still pulled through. An important question is whether the crypto market is vulnerable to stagflation. Stagflation was a household phenomenon when the United States was taken off the gold standard by former President Richard Nixon. Stagflation is an acute situation where inflation rates surge above anticipated scales in an economy. In such an event, unemployment rates surge significantly, in the long run proving to be detrimental to the economy. Future Stagflation Stagflation has recently become a hot topic among investors, and it is a looming threat to the global economy. An example of such an event was when the Standard &amp; Poor 500 Index of US stock averaged at +2.5%, but during stagflation, it was a 2.5% decline. Stagflation is a reality considering that the positive correlation between crypto and NASDAQ keeps getting tighter. The ever-growing popularity of crypto and the blockchain industry has created high demand for digital assets. Moreover, stagflation has been linked to declining profit margins, when companies face dwindling sales and higher prices. During such an event, the demand for digital assets will increase. If the rates increase and the economy slows, asset prices will decline, including cr...",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/heres-why-the-crypto-market-is-still-vulnerable-to-stagflation/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-why-the-crypto-market-is-still-vulnerable-to-stagflation,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42394212,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZhkR,1655335800,In Conversation With the Federal Reserve Chief Innovation Officer,"I had the pleasure of speaking with the Federal Reserve System’s Sunayna Tuteja at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, last week about the U.S. central bank’s philosophical approach to innovation at large. You can watch and read the conversation below.  Some housekeeping: The next few issues of this newsletter will be selected interviews and snippets of interviews from various panel discussions at Consensus and conversations I’ve had, including a second edition of this newsletter sometime this week that’s just recapping all the stuff I missed while traveling. Normal issues will resume in July.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Fed Innovation  The narrative  Sunayna Tuteja is the Federal Reserve System’s chief innovation officer, where she works on issues tied to central bank digital currencies [CBDCs], digital assets and other technology concerns. Prior to that, she was the head of digital assets at TD Ameritrade. She moderated a panel with her colleagues at Consensus 2022, before speaking to me on the sidelines of the event.  Why it matters  The Federal Reserve is perhaps best known for its work on economic issues, but it has also done quite a bit of research on central bank digital currencies and similar issues over the past few months. (This interview has been edited for clarity.)  Breaking it down  Nikhilesh De: Hello and welcome to CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022. My name is Nik De, I'm a reporter with the team. I'm joined today by the Federal Reserve System’s Sunayna Tuteja, who's going to talk about being at the Fed and the Fed’s innovation team.  Sunayna Tuteja: Hey, Nik, thank you. I'm delighted to be here. And yes, an ex-bitcoiner and DeFi [decentralized finance] degen [degenerate] is now the chief innovation officer at the Federal Reserve System. And this is, in fact, our first time at Consensus. We've been here all week and did a session, “Demystifying the Federal Reserve,” which was really designed to explain there's FUD about crypto, there's also a lot of FUD about the Fed and, hopefully, we demystified some of that.  But I'll say one of my favorite parts of spending the week here is we did tons of bilaterals with builders in the industry, and hosted, I think, upwards of five meetups with builders, engineers and investors in the space and really taking the time to listen and learn from the ecosystem of what's exciting them, what they're working on and where and how the Fed can be a collaborator in advancing that innovation.  Can you just tell me about, you know, kind of what you do … how the Fed got to a point where it hired someone, a bitcoiner, to be an innovation officer.  So before I joined the Fed, I spent my entire career in the private sector and really the last decade as a builder, operator and investor in fintech [financial technology], and really in crypto. So I personally got into crypto in 2010, 2011 and professionally since 2015. And the reality is, when I first got the call about this role as the chief innovation officer at the Fed, I was convinced for the first 10 minutes [that] it was one of my bitcoin friends pulling some sort of prank on me.  And then when I realized, “Oh, this is a real job,” my question was, wait, central banking, innovation, isn't that an oxymoron? But the reality is, innovation really has been part and parcel of the Fed’s DNA, and in this role it's really about amplifying that innovation, scaling that innovation. And as I like to say, it’s really kick-starting the metabolism and speeding up that innovation within the Fed. So you know, I often like to joke that my job at the Fed is to try and red-pill my colleagues while they try to fed-pill me. And you know, we see where we land in the middle, and we have a portfolio of initiatives, which I'm happy to double-click into in terms of how we're scaling and speeding up that innovation.  Maybe let's expand on that. Can you talk about specifics, any projects or initiatives that you're looking at that really relate that you know, that you think the crypto industry, in particular, might be fascinated by?  Yeah, absolutely. The one thing maybe I'll share is, you know, when we, when I think about the anchoring heuristic for innovation, oftentimes innovation does get tethered to technology. But it doesn't have to be, right? So I take a very tech-agnostic view to innovation. And for me, the metrics of “are we advancing the right type of innovation that's generating meaningful outcomes” is really anchored on a threefold heuristic. So number one is, are we solving gnarly problems? And believe me, there's a lot of gnarly problems that need to be solved.  Number two is, are we solving those problems with an obsession on the end customer. I know, colleagues in the crypto and fintech industry are like, wait, the Fed has customers? I'm like, yes! You know, everything we do touches everyday Americans, but also institutions, both domestic and globally. So we have to be thinking about that end user experience. And then the third thing is through innovation, are we leveling up and future-proofing our value proposition? Like with any organization of any size, just because you've been relevant for the last 100 years, does not guarantee that you will be relevant in the next 100 years, so how do we keep leveling up and making sure that the value we're rendering is meaningful?  So with that heuristic in mind, the way we really are bringing innovation to life, I'll share one concrete example, which is the first time I'm talking about it publicly. [This] is something that we've built out within the Fed over the last nine months called the Innovation Launchpad. So if you're in the private industry, Big Tech or even startups and in the crypto space, oftentimes when you think about innovation, there's a level of speed to go from exploration, to experimentation to execution.  Now, when you're a 100-year-old institution, with a massive responsibility and scale, those cycle times can be very elongated. And a lot of times that innovation can get stopped in its tracks. Because you have to get all these approvals, you have to run around trying to justify your use case or you can’t get access to the right technology.  So one of the things we did is, learning actually from the crypto and fintech industry, creating this incubator model. So within the Federal Reserve, we now have the Innovation Launchpad that gives all 20,000 employees of the Fed – and by the way, the Fed is a solar system, because it's not – I often like to tell our bitcoin friends that there's nothing central about the central bank of the United States. It's actually these 13 planets that operate as a solar system, but making sure everybody has access to emerging technologies. They can learn and get a tactile experience. … But even if you're a policymaker, if you have touched and worked and understood [artificial intelligence] and machine learning now, as you're writing policies on that subject matter, you actually have a learned experience, a lived experience, which makes a difference, and then to execution.  So how do we go from finding those problem statements, applying emerging technologies and executing it at scale, within days and weeks versus months and years? So our next iteration of the launchpad, we want to create a forked version of the launchpad, where we want to bring in collaboration and co-creation with academia and with industry, so we can work together with them in this experimentation zone to solve the problems, the bold problems and do it with a bias for action.  I don't want to get into the philosophical question of whether or not the Fed should issue a central bank digital currency. We've heard, you know, various discussions that Congress will eventually make a decision. But I'm really curious more on the philosophical questions about just what are the questions that need to be answered on the technical side? … You know, what do you need to look at? What do your colleagues need to look at? And how are you thinking about this?  I appreciate you framing it that way. Because there's a lot about this topic that is not in our zone of control. And I am always like, okay, let's focus on the things we can control and because you can drive yourself crazy trying to control things you can't control.  So with the CBDC, whether I was in the private sector, and now within the context of the Fed, I tried to again apply that product owner mindset. So let's create this through line, right? In a way money is the ultimate consumer facing product, all several – 7 billion people around the world have some sort of relationship with money, be it analog, digital, DeFi or who knows, right? I would submit that the U.S. dollar today has a pretty enviable product market fit, you know, the TAM [total addressable market], the enviable TAM. But if I'm the product owner of something that has a pretty awesome TAM, I do not get to rest on my laurels, I actually need to be operating with a healthy sense of paranoia, and take on the responsibility of disrupting my own product and leveling it up and making it better and better before somebody else tries to disrupt it.  So if you apply that product owner mindset, of course, it behooves us to be leaning in, to be experimenting, and researching, and thinking about the design principles, and how to throttle those design principles agnostic of whether it manifests or not, or whether there's a need for it or not, we always need to be flexing that muscle and developing those muscles, right. And, you know, at the end of January, as you know, the Fed for the first time dropped its public perspectives on digital asset ecosystems, and this specifically around CBDC. And I know the word “humility” doesn't often get associated with the Fed. But I hope that you will see the tone in that paper was genuinely humble, because we recognize that this is a nascent technology that is shape shifting, and we're really coming at it from a learner's mindset.  And along with our perspective, there were over 25 questions that we're still interrogating. And a lot of those questions are exactly as you reference, you know, what do the features and functionalities of a CBDC look like? You know, we talk a lot about interoperability and programmability and privacy. Great, but those are very broad themes. How do we double, triple, quadruple, you know, click into these aspects, and really frame out through research and technical experimentation? What are those right throttle points so whatever manifests is adding that ultimate meaning and value for the consumers and the personas.  We take a very first principles approach, which is, what is the problem we're trying to solve? Why does this problem need to be solved? Who are the end users and personas for whom we are solving this problem? And, most importantly, why is the Fed uniquely qualified to solve these problems? Right? And how do we engage and complement and collaborate with the innovation that's happening in the private sector, and we would love to continue to hear from this industry as we have been over the last week, and really continue that learning journey.  Also, to that last point, say someone who's watching this video wants to get in touch with a member of your team or someone at your local Fed office. What’s the best way for them to do it?  Yeah, I'm so glad you asked that. One of the things that we've been doing over the last few months is intentionally reaching out to the crypto community, the DeFi, the Web 3 community, the builders in this community, because when the Fed says, “Hey, we want to hear from the industry,” the incumbents know how to talk to the Fed, how to reach the Fed and how to have conversations with the Fed.  The reality is, this industry doesn't even know that the Fed wants to hear from them, let alone how to talk to the Fed. The simplest way I would implore your audience [to do] is, number one, our virtual door’s open. If you have a contact or you know how to engage with your local Federal Reserve Bank, great. If not, honestly, hit me up. I'm on Telegram. I'm on Twitter, I'm on LinkedIn, and I'll be more than happy to understand what you're trying to accomplish. And then, whether it's my team and I or whether it's connecting you to my colleagues at the Fed, the virtual door’s open. As I joke, I'm happy to be the Bumble app of innovation and connect the communities of the Fed, and my communities from crypto and DeFi and Web 3 to have this dialogue. And the other thing, if I might put a plug in, Nik, is something we're starting called Fed Corps. Think of it like the Peace Corps, but for the Federal Reserve.  People don't realize that there's 5,000 technologists that work at the Fed, everything from cybersecurity professionals, to engineers, to UX designers, to agile coaches. And as we take on more of these gnarly and bold problems, and we strive to solve them with this bias for action, we need talent. This ecosystem has some of the most talented builders, and if you are energized by solving big problems and making a dent, and in a way serving your country, we'd be also interested in having conversations. I think right now we have over 500 technology jobs open at the Fed. So, we'd love to have a conversation about that as well.  Awesome. So just one last question. And this is gonna be a curveball. What are you personally looking at any projects, any types of technologies, anything out there that is really, you know, catching your eye.  So two things. One, I have gone from doomscrolling on Twitter to doomscrolling on Discord, because I cannot get enough DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations]. And I think I'm just obsessed about, I'm really intrigued about, the self-governing mechanisms that sound really possible and aspirational and abstract. But as you try to apply them, like with any new technology, there's all these different gradations of how they manifest and what works, what doesn't.  And as you know, there's a lot of DAO projects happening, and we're learning a lot through each one of them. So I'm spending a lot of time on Discord, like just learning through these DAO communities.  I think the other thing is, we're paying a lot of attention to quantum computing. In addition to the [Biden presidential] executive order through the White House or on digital assets, there was one around quantum computing. When I was a bitcoiner and people would be like, ‘Oh, quantum is gonna break bitcoin,” I did the eyeroll thing, but I tried to learn about it.  I think we just hosted a half-day [meeting to] level up our quantum computing understanding session at the Fed, and all of our senior leaders and all of our staff got to attend. And we brought in some of the leading experts from academia, but also builders who are experimenting with this technology. And we had a very pragmatic conversation about what is this technology: Where is it really going, where is it in the S curve cycle at the moment? But then also, how should the Fed be thinking about it?  And it's in the context of the research work that we do, but also supervision and regulation? So if the banks that we supervise and regulate are adopting this technology, what does that mean in terms of how we should be thinking about it? Also, we have a huge cyber functio/ How should we be interrogating quantum computing, both in playing defense but also playing offense?  So that's something I've been going down the rabbit hole on and just trying to learn about it and think about how that applies in the context of the Fed. I like to think about it in the approach of the what: the so what and the now what. I don't have any clear answers yet. But as I tell people who are crypto skeptics, it's okay to be skeptical but you have to keep learning and understanding because apathy is not kosher. And I'm trying to apply that same advice to quantum for myself, which is I don't know where all this is going. But it'd behoove me to be learning and understanding and see if there's something we should be doing.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  We actually have not seen much in the way of movement with the heads of any agencies. However, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision nominee Michael Barr and SEC commissioner nominees Jaime Lizárraga and Mark Uyeda have all advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee.  The Senate also confirmed National Credit Union Administration Chairman Todd Harper to a full term, which will end in April 2027.

Delo, alongside BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, pleaded guilty to charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act earlier this year in a case that stemmed from 2020. Delo also agreed to pay a $10 million fine in settling a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) case filed in February.  Hayes was previously sentenced to six months of home detention and two years of probation, alongside a similar fine.  A spokesperson from Smith Villazor, the firm representing Delo, said, “We are pleased that the Court appropriately rejected the government’s cynical attempt to exaggerate the seriousness of the Bank Secrecy Act charge in this case.

42423123,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Mvth,1655326192,"Market Wrap: Fed Hikes Rates at Highest Level Since 1994, Bitcoin Rallies After","Bitcoin’s (BTC) price fluctuated after the Federal Reserve announced further monetary tightening on Wednesday, falling to as low as $20,270 in the minutes after the Fed's statement. But roughly an hour after the announcement, the cryptocurrency was changing hands at $21,444.  In a widely anticipated move, the central bank announced that it will raise the fed-funds rate, the interest rate at which depository institutions trade balances held at the central bank, by three-quarters of a percentage point, or 75 basis points.  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that members of the Federal Open Markets Committee said the inflation surprise on the upside warranted “strong action at this meeting” rather than waiting another six weeks for the FOMC's next gathering.  “We decided we needed to go ahead, and so we did,” Powell said. “We came to the view that we’d like to do a little more front-end loading on that.”  The rate hike is the Fed's highest since 1994 and underscores the inflationary pressure on the U.S. economy..  The fed-funds rate will rise to a range of 1.5%-1.75%. In the long term, committee members expect the benchmark interest rate to go up to 3.4% this year and to 3.8% in 2023, according to the “dot plot,” a pictorial representation of Fed officials' projections for the central bank's key short-term interest rate published on a quarterly basis.  Bitcoin fell over 5% following the decision but rebounded during Powell’s press conference, where he said that the Fed would boost rates by a half point or three-quarters of a point at each of its next two meetings.  “Markets loathe uncertainty and unpredictability,” said Josh Olszewicz, head of research at Valkyrie. “Digital assets have significantly correlated with U.S. financial markets in recent months, both of which have continued to bleed lower. A decrease in downward volatility will only likely be achieved with a pause or reversal of the current Fed policy and direction.”  Equities also moved up following the Fed statement. The S&P 500 rose 2.1%, and the Nasdaq gained 3.3%.

Tether Sees New Wave of Redemptions as Fear of Market Contagion Spreads  By Krisztian Sandor  Investors pulled about $1.6 billion from Tether's dollar-pegged USDT stablecoin over the past 48 hours, reducing its circulating supply to $70.8 billion, the lowest amount since last October, according to price tracker CoinGecko.  Tether's USDT has a different financial structure from the Terra blockchain's UST ""algorithmic stablecoin,"" which collapsed last month. But USDT has long suffered from investor doubts about the assets backing it and whether redemptions would be honored in a full-blown crisis.  ""Confidence in cryptos remains depressed and some traders are worried that Tether could suffer a similar fate as Terra's UST stablecoin,"" Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda, said. ""Too many institutional crypto investors are down massively, and they are worried that if this part of the crypto ecosystem collapses, Tether will crash.""  Altcoin roundup  Tether dismisses commercial paper rumors: Tether denied claims that its commercial paper portfolio is 85% backed by Chinese or Asian commercial paper. The firm also denied having exposure to Three Arrows Capital, the beleaguered hedge fund, and said it liquidated its position without a loss in crypto lender Celsius Network. Read more here.  All eyes on staked ether: The discount on locked-up ether on Lido (stETH) compared with ether (ETH) widened to a record high of 8% as large holders including Celsius and Three Arrows Capital have been selling their tokens potentially to meet margin calls. The “depeg” is leading to concerns about a potential ripple effect on crypto lending markets. In the short term, there will be tremendous selling pressure, but stETH is not Terra – it is highly unlikely to fall to zero. Read more here.

42394043,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bucjUb,1655325820,Crypto Lending Platforms 'Should Be Regulated': Former CFTC Chairman,"Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Timothy Massad believes there should be stronger regulation for lending platforms across the crypto industry, especially in light of the recent freeze of withdrawals by cryptocurrency trading firm Celsius earlier this week.  “A lot of people have losses who didn’t understand the risks they were taking,” Massad said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program.  Massad, now a research fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, said there are areas of concern for lending platforms any time a substantial amount of leverage and lending is involved, and prices stop rising.  According to Massad, those concerns are a function of two different things. The first is connectedness, or “the extent to which one institution, one platform or one decentralized finance (DeFi) arrangement might be connected to other things.” The second is a matter of contagion, he said, which can mean “people just start getting worried.”  Celsius and stablecoins  Issues regarding Celsius have loomed for some time, drawing skepticism from securities regulators in states like Kentucky. Two years ago, questions were raised about Celsius making uncollateralized loans, and back in October, stablecoin issuer Tether loaned $1 billion dollars to Celsius. When asked if any securities laws were violated on the latter transaction, Massad said that “it’s hard to make a judgment,” citing Tether’s lack of transparency.  Read more: Tether Has Loaned $1B to Celsius Network: Report  “There is the possibility that this was an unregistered investment fund,” he said. “There is the possibility it was making unregistered offers and sales of securities.”  More broadly, Massad adds that for the stablecoin industry, there is a role for stablecoins that are backed by high liquid assets, such as cash and Treasurys, but a regulatory framework is needed.  Read more: Tether Denies Claims of Asian Commercial Paper Backing, Exposure to Three Arrows Capital  “I think one can be created under existing law,” Massad said, who also told CoinDesk he is working on a paper with a Harvard Law School professor on the topic. “I don’t think we need to wait for legislation.”  ‘Heads in the sand’  In Celsius’ case, Massad notes that the securities law framework could apply, despite the firm’s obscure operation model.  “I think the people running Celsius had their heads in the sand,” he said.  The recent Celsius kerfuffle could be a catalyst for the larger challenges surrounding the crypto industry and what is deemed stable. “That's where I think we need a bank-like framework,” Massad said. “I think we know how to do that. I think it’s possible under existing law.”  Moreover, Massad said, resources are needed to create a framework of regulation that would impose the same standards that are in place for securities markets that could be used for crypto as well.  “You simply say, any platform that is trading even one instrument, which is a security or a commodity, has to basically comply with some core principles, some basic standards for everything that’s traded,” he said.  That standard would apply to centralized exchanges and DeFi platforms, Massad added.  “We need a framework of reasonable regulation for crypto that can support innovation and that gives people confidence that they know what they're investing in if they choose to invest,” he said. “It’ll help ferret out the meaningful, sensible innovations from the scams.”",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | USDT,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/15/crypto-lending-platforms-should-be-regulated-former-cftc-chairman,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3dd2b70f1738a23a10c3ad4a0a388f3a11b1096-1856x1094.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With upbeat bulls, BAT crypto can surge to $0.42 in the near term. Past Performance of Basic Attention Token The Basic Attention Token coin is ripping higher at spot rates. Currently, the coin is up 11 percent against the USDT, printing higher as per the BAT technical analysis in the daily chart. When the rest of the crypto assets are struggling against a deluge of strong selling pressure, BAT coin prices are firm. BAT Technical Analysis BAT crypto prices seem to be bottoming up. Adding 11 percent versus the USDT, bulls are correcting the undervaluation of June 15. Notably, the Doji bar has a long lower wick pointing to the rejection of bears. The follow-through on June 15 indicates that the tide could be changing, favoring optimistic Basic Attention Token coin bulls. BAT coin bulls stand a chance if prices are steady above $0.26. In that case, traders can buy the dip, targeting this month&apos;s highs at $0.42 for a near 50 percent surge. What to Expect from BAT?

Now fresh signs are emerging that the nervousness is hitting Tether, the issuer of the most popular stablecoin.  Investors pulled out about $1.6 billion in 48 hours from Tether's dollar-pegged USDT stablecoin, reducing its circulating supply to $70.8 billion, the lowest since October 2021, according to price tracker CoinGecko.  Tether's USDT has a different financial structure from the Terra blockchain's UST ""algorithmic stablecoin,"" which collapsed last month. But USDT has long suffered from investor doubts about the assets backing it, and whether redemptions would be honored in a full-blown crisis.  ""Confidence in cryptos remains depressed and some traders are worried that Tether could suffer a similar fate as Terra's UST stablecoin,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said. ""Too many institutional crypto investors are down massively, and they are worried that if this part of the crypto ecosystem collapses, Tether will crash.""  Fear dominates in the crypto market as the price of cryptocurrencies crash and several big industry players face financial difficulties. Celsius, a crypto lender that once held over $10 billion in client assets, suspended withdrawals and transactions to prevent a run on its deposits and hired lawyers to restructure its liabilities. Three Arrows Capital, one of the largest crypto hedge funds, is also under scrutiny.  Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Tether, said that Tether liquidated its Celsius position without a loss and has no exposure to Three Arrows Capital.  The composition of Tether's reserve to back the price of USDT has long since been an area of concern in the crypto market, with questions surrounding the nebulous ""commercial paper"" holding and digital asset investments. According to Tether's website, the reserve holds about $71 billion in assets.  In May, Tether lost $10 billion in market capitalization in the wake of the Terra ecosystem's implosion and the crash of the third-largest stablecoin, terraUSD (UST), to near zero from its dollar peg, which shook investors' trust in the stability of stablecoins.  A part of that money landed on Circle's USD coin (USDC), the second largest stablecoin, which was perceived as a safer choice, Moya said then.

42423115,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Mvdh,1655317103,Fed Announces Biggest Interest Rate Hike in 28 Years; Bitcoin Gains,"The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by 75 basis points, or three-quarters of a percentage point. It is the biggest rate hike in 28 years, part of an ongoing effort to bring down soaring inflation that has roiled the economy and markets from stocks and bonds to cryptocurrencies.  The U.S. central bank also announced it would continue reducing the size of its balance sheet at the rate announced in May, according to a statement by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the Fed's monetary policy.  The Fed Funds rate, the range at which commercial banks can borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other overnight, will rise to a range of 1.5%-1.75%, according to the Fed. Bond traders are pricing in a range of 3.25%-3.5% by the end of the year, implying an unusually rapid and harsh pace of monetary tightening, according to Goldman Sachs.  ""The current picture is plain to see,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday at a press conference after the decision was announced. ""The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high.""  The last time the Fed raised its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point was in 1994. Powell said the U.S. central bank will not ""declare victory"" until officials see ""compelling evidence"" that inflation is coming down.  Given that May’s Consumer Price Index measuring inflation came in hotter than expected, at a fresh four-decade high, markets already started reacting to the possibility of a faster rate hike in the days leading up to this week's Fed meeting. The closed-door meeting started on Tuesday and culminated with the statement on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.  ""Markets loathe uncertainty and unpredictability,"" said Josh Olszewicz, head of research at Valkyrie. ""A decrease in downward volatility will only likely be achieved with a pause or reversal of the current Fed policy and direction.""  Bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $21,444 about an hour after the meeting, up from $21,076 when the decision was released. Most analysts had already priced in the hike in the days leading up to the meeting.  ""Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter,"" the Fed said in Wednesday's statement. ""Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the [coronavirus] pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.""  Fed dot plot  During his press conference in May, Powell had ruled out the possibility of a 75 basis point hike, saying that it is “not something that the committee is actively considering.” Instead, central bankers had hinted at two 50 basis point hikes in June and July.  But the situation changed after the last Consumer Price Index report showed an acceleration in inflation to 8.6%, rather than a slowdown as expected. Powell had mentioned at his last conference that if the Fed didn’t see inflation pressures “abating” and “coming down,” the central bank would “consider moving more aggressively.”  Powell said Wednesday that last week's inflation surprise warranted “strong action at this meeting” rather than waiting another six weeks for the next gathering.  “We decided we needed to go ahead, and so we did,” Powell said. “We came to the view that we’d like to do a little more front-end loading on that.”  In addition to the statement, the Fed published revised quarterly economic projections, or “dot plot,” a pictorial representation of Fed officials' projections for the central bank's key short-term interest rate.  Members expect the fund’s rate to go up to 3.4% in 2022 and 3.8% in 2023.

42411791,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzoC,1655316864,15 Ways to Stay Sane While Trading Crypto,"This is not a guide of how to trade crypto. This is not about how to make money, how to invest or where to find alpha.  But if you’ve dabbled in crypto trading? Then you know this one thing: It can be all-consuming. When your money is on the line, suddenly you’re checking the prices more than you check social media, you obsess about the charts, and even your dreams are filled with candlesticks and Elliot Waves.  Oh, and there’s never a break. Stock day-traders might be Red Bull-pounding stress-monsters from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Monday to Friday, but they are then forced to relax when the market closes. Crypto is always on. Trades beckon. If you’re asleep at 2am? Maybe you just missed a 10X opportunity. Spent Sunday morning at brunch? Maybe you failed to avoid a -40% bloodbath. So it’s easy to stare at the screens – and stare and stare and stare.  See also: Is There a 'Best' Time to Trade Crypto? Here’s What the Data Says  “The casino never closes,” says Scott Melker, a trader who goes by the alias The Wolf of All Streets (and one of The Men Who Stare at Charts). “It’s just very, very difficult to detach. It’s a forced skill.”  So how do you cultivate that skill? More broadly, how do you protect your mental health while investing or trading in cryptocurrency? We spoke with Kevin Zhou, head trader of Galois Capital; Bobby Cho, partner at CMS Holdings and Melker to get some insight on best practices.  Each trader stressed – repeatedly – that this is not financial advice. Instead these are tips, strategies and guidance for how to stay sane.  1. Set trading hours.  Sure, the exchanges are open 24/7, but that doesn’t mean you need to be. “I treat it like a business,” says Melker, who only trades between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and then he has dinner, puts his kids to bed and lives like a normal person.  Read More: 4 Things You Find in Crypto That Aren’t in Traditional Finance  2. Make a plan. Stick to it.  Each trader emphasized mental discipline. “Do your homework in terms of why you found a trade interesting, and what you intend to do with it,” says Cho. “I tend to take a lot of notes, like, ‘What’s the risk/reward profile of what I’m doing? What am I willing to make on the trade, and what can I stand to lose?’” Cho says that once you’ve “capped” your potential losses and gains, then you’re less likely to impulsively act on emotion.  Melker agrees, noting, “A lot of people stare at the charts, willing it [the price] to go up or down.” He doesn’t do this. Instead, Melker plans his trades in advance, creates his entry and exit points, and then he ignores the chart, as it’s “in the hands of the Trading Gods.” He steps away and goes about his life. “The biggest mistake people make is emotionally changing their plan, mid-trade,” says Melker. “Moving your stop-loss down because you think it’s about to bounce 100x right after you got stopped-out.”  3. Tame the greed, manage the fear.  Zhou says the biggest problems in trading are hubris, fear and greed. Keep the emotions neutral. Focus on the methodology, the framework of the trade, the cold logic of the percentages. “You shouldn’t feel too good about the wins that you have, and you shouldn’t feel too bad about the losses,” says Zhou. But okay, real talk? That’s easier said than done. How do you cope with the losses? (Because there will be losses.)  4. Treat losses as an opportunity to learn.  Every loss, says Zhou, can teach you something about trading. Reframe the loss. Don’t let it be a trigger for anger, despair, or self-flagellation. Let it be a trigger for learning. “Just analyze the situation,” says Zhou. “The first question is, did you take that loss because you came in with a positive edge – more than 50% – and then you got unlucky? And don’t lie to yourself.” If you simply got unlucky, well then just roll with it, as that happens and you need to focus on the long-term.  The second question Zhou says you should ask: “If that’s not the case, if you actually made the wrong decision, then try to figure out what led you to that wrong decision. Was the logic unsound? Or was the logic sound but your assumptions unsound?” Cold analysis can temper hot anxiety.  5. Exercise.  Obvious? Maybe. But also overlooked. “It’s essential that you go to the gym, or exercise somehow, to clear your head,” says Melker.  6. Compartmentalize.  Especially in the early days of crypto trading, it’s natural to obsess about the prices, positions and possibilities throughout the day no matter what you’re doing – in the shower, on a date, even playing with your kids. Cho checks this impulse by compartmentalizing his different activities in life, and then lasering his attention on whatever he’s doing. “On Saturday morning, my kids are going to wake up around 7:30 or 8, and I’m going to spend the morning with them,” he says, and in that time he doesn’t check the charts or think about crypto. His priority is the kids.  Conversely, on Monday morning when he’s in trading mode, that gets his full attention. “If you don’t have these priorities,” says Cho, “then your focus is all over the place, and you’re half-assing everything.”  7. Don’t put too much financial pressure on trading.  The trades become harder to stomach when your livelihood depends on the outcome. It’s harder to think rationally. It’s easy to get swallowed up by anxiety, which might nudge you to chase losses or gains. “Take the pressure off with multiple income streams,” says Melker. “It’s helpful if you don’t need to make $1,000 a day trading.”  8. Strip away the emotions.  This one’s critical enough to warrant a bit of repetition. “It’s extremely important to have emotional control while you’re trading,” says Zhou – important for both mental sanity and financial performance. The best way to develop that emotional control? Practice. Repetition. Time on task.  “When you start out trading, it’s very normal that when things go well you feel like a genius, like you’re on top of the world. And when things go badly you feel like an idiot, and you get depressed,” says Zhou. Then you keep trading. You keep learning. “Over time, as you do it more and more, you get used to it, and it doesn’t affect your day-to-day,"" he says. ""It’s really important to get to that point, because you definitely don’t want emotions affecting you.”  9. Take breaks.  Cho frequently steps away from the phone, laptop, charts, crypto Twitter. He says this is necessary for balance and sanity. “Ultimately, there’s a whole world outside of crypto,” says Cho, and then laughs a bit. “Although some would say there isn’t.”  10. Think of yourself as 'the house.'  In casinos they say the house always wins, because over the long haul, once you tune out the noise of flukey players who do well at blackjack, the house enjoys the percentage edge. If you have a 52% chance of winning, you will rack up many Ls, and maybe you might even lose three or five or ten times in a row. But when the sample size gets to be 10,000, you will win around 52% of the time. Melker says that if you’re trading with the right mindset, that’s how you view each trade, and let the losses roll off you. “It’s almost like this long-term mathematical formula,” says Melker. “If you execute, and you do it long enough, you just win a little more than you lose.” Melker says that at this point, individual losses “don’t affect me at all.”  11. Cultivate other priorities.  Or as Melker puts it, Get a life. This helps keep balance and can curb the obsession. “I have two children, and I have a wife,” he says. “It’s important to me not to be an absentee father or a slave to my iPhone.” Along those lines…  12. Practice good time management.  “Time management is a key feature in everything I do,” says Cho. “In any given hour I ask, what is my priority? And understanding that list of priorities is very important.” If his priority for the hour is to research Company X, then he will focus on that, and only that, and he won’t obsess about crypto prices. Conversely, if the focus of the hour is to trade, then that commands his attention and he won’t worry about Company X. “Obviously you’re not agnostic about what’s happening in the market,” says Cho, “but establishing priorities helps.”  13. Schedule time for content consumption.  Crypto trading and investing, for many, is more than just price action: It’s also about understanding the tech, the philosophy and the constant changes to this fascinating new world. That can be a lot to keep up with. Instead of getting distracted by every tweet and every crypto article – which can add anxiety, fuel ADD and take you away from your current area of focus – Cho simply dumps new content in what is essentially a “to read later” bucket and then catches up when he’s ready to focus on that and only that.  See also: 4 Things to Do in a Crypto Bear Market  14. Ditch the phone.  In the old universe where people went out to restaurants for dinner, pre-COVID, Melker and his wife had a deal: “If we were out, I would leave my phone in the car,” he says. “When the phone’s in the car, I’m not going to think about it.”  Alternatively, in a dissenting opinion, here’s a different perspective entirely:  Contrarian Take: Accept that there is no such thing as work/life balance.  “I’m a little contrarian here,” Zhou says, acknowledging that this cuts against the grain of the Maintain Balance ethos. “For people who really want to get good at something, there’s no such thing as workplace balance.” He adds, “Sometimes you lose sleep. Sometimes you lose friends.” Zhou admits this can take a toll, and maybe it means your social life takes a hit. “But there’s a lot of opportunity here,” he says. “We can rest while we’re dead.”  15. Know that crypto obsession will never truly go away.  Even the most seasoned, well-balanced traders say that, at times, they can still surrender to compulsive price-checking impulse. “It still remains a challenge at times,” says Melker. “You can’t predict when bitcoin is going to strap you into the roller coaster.”  And finally, a bonus consideration:  Value your time over money.  This is less a specific hack and more of a general principle. In essence, the concept is this: Don’t forget what really matters. “The most valuable lesson you learn is that the point of your money is to buy free time,” says Melker. “It’s not so you can spend more time trying to make money. Trading should be one of those rare opportunities where, if you’re successful, you’re not slaving away to make someone else wealthy.”  In other words, if you’re spending 24/7 staring at crypto charts, and never doing anything else with your life, have you really beaten the system?

42423117,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Mvfh,1655316098,A Manhattan Landlord Listed His Office Building in ETH as an NFT. Then Its Price Dropped $12M,"A New York City office building went on sale for $29 million two weeks ago, but with a Web 3 twist: The rights to purchase the property are being sold as a non-fungible token (NFT) on OpenSea.  The listing’s price, however, was set in ether (ETH), which has plummeted over 40% since the start of June, taking the list price of the building with it.  The dollar value of the NFT has dropped from $29 million to $16.8 million, though its owner, Chris Okada, says the price will soon be adjusted.  “We’re going to relist the sale at $29.5 million, most probably Thursday,” Okada told CoinDesk in a Twitter message on Tuesday. “Deciding on staying with ETH or going to USDC. If we go with ETH it’ll be closer to 26,500 ETH.”  It’s currently listed for ​​15,000 ETH. It was purchased for $16.25 million in late 2021.  ‘Real utility’  Okada is the CEO of Okada & Co, a commercial real estate company that owns 43 buildings in Manhattan and is turning to blockchain to diversify its clientele.  “There are crypto billionaires and crypto millionaires out there that have no real utility of their cryptocurrency other than actually having it in their wallet,” Okada told CoinDesk in an interview. “I see this as a marriage of my real estate knowledge and NFT interest.”  Okada says he was partially inspired by Gary Vaynerchuck’s Flyfish Club, an NFT membership collection whose holders have exclusive access to a yet-to-be-built restaurant.  How the sale works  The 109-111 W. 24th St. NFT itself is not the actual deed to the property, an added security layer to avoid any potential large-scale phishing or listing errors.  The owner of the NFT is instead granted “exclusive rights to acquire the building, all its uses rights and related deed covenants,” according to the listing.  Once the NFT is purchased, the buyer will have to go through all the steps of making a non-blockchain real estate transaction, with the exception of transferring the funds. Buyers are also encouraged to talk with the company before completing the sale, as well as negotiate a price. (Okada says eight potential buyers have already expressed interest.)  Read more: NFT-Linked House Sells for $650K in Propy’s First US Sale  The sale is both emblematic of innovative use cases for NFTs and their legal limitations, with New York’s real estate registration system making it impossible to list an actual deed as an NFT.  “The sale is really a bridge between the old-guard real estate servers and blockchain,” Okada said. “I will be at that bridge, trying to figure out this connectivity issue. It may not be in New York, it may have to be, you know, Westchester or Miami, or it may be a forward-thinking city.”  More to come  Okada said his company has been experimenting with ways to implement blockchain for the past few months, but ran into legal complications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) involving the fractionalized ownership of property sales.  Future plans for blockchain-based real estate sales from the company include rentable office space and co-working desks, a concept recently brought to life in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City just two months ago.  “While I believe that we are moving in the direction of storing real property titles on-chain, and being able to effectuate property transfers and sales through on-chain mechanisms, we are not there yet,” pseudonymous crypto lawyer exlawyer.eth told CoinDesk. “Though it is exciting to see how people believe the blockchain can be used, and this is just one example of some of the innovative uses that we will see in the coming months and years.”  While the sale will be the first commercial office space sold as an NFT, the residential housing market has already seen its fair share of blockchain involvement.

There are now signs of a liquidity crunch, and maybe even insolvency, at the centralized lending platform Celsius Network ­– arguably the “other shoe” dropping after the LUNA/UST unwind. Trouble at Celsius in turn has traders worried about stETH, an important bond-like token related to the Ethereum 2.0 Merge. There are also apparently liquidity issues at Three Arrows Capital, and to top it all off, crypto exchange Coinbase just laid off 1,100 people.  There is so much to say about this moment, and we here at CoinDesk will be saying all of it in the coming weeks and months as we help you navigate the crypto crisis. But before the dominos started toppling at scale, I was planning for this column to be about the amazingness of Consensus. And I still think that’s important, because the vision and passion that was on display in Austin, Texas, last weekend is exactly how we find our way out of this mess.  A big tent  Above all, Consensus was a big tent. Huge, in fact, literally and figuratively. We drew 17,000 attendees to the conference itself, and another 3,000 attended satellite events. It was the South by Southwest of crypto, complete with concerts from Disclosure and Big Boi. And it will be next year, too.  More to the point, though, the breadth of programming and perspectives was mind-boggling. For instance, I was on my way to moderate a panel and had a few moments to spare, so I stuck my head in a random auditorium – and there was Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who has little crypto involvement aside from a shared concern about data harvesting.  I got to see sci-fi author Neal Stephenson and technologist Jaron Lanier in conversation with CoinDesk contributor Leah Callon-Butler. I myself got to interview one of the Baylor University bitcoin researchers, and also had a delightfully unhinged conversation with Chris Gabriel, aka MemeAnalysis, about memetics, Freud, black magic and the CIA.  See also: Ex-CIA Director Says Criminals Will Move Away From Bitcoin  Crypto, it seems clear, is becoming a Schelling point for various stripes of dissatisfaction with the status quo. A Schelling point is, very loosely, a symbol, site, technology or other focal point that draws people together to collaborate without explicit communication or coordination. Crypto has seized society’s imagination and become a site for transformative change – even if we’re not clear where it’s headed.  Crashdown?  And here we get to the market crash. I feel immense empathy for those who are losing their jobs right now, and for those who will in the coming days and weeks. I’ve been there – I lost my job as a result of the 2018 crypto crash.  But there are also immense positives to a crypto downturn. The products failing – particularly Luna and Celsius – were substantially illusory all along, driven by inflated, unsustainable returns. It’s now becoming clear that the “profits” depositors in these systems received were essentially a game of musical chairs using venture capital money.  Coinbase, meanwhile, has admitted that it made a major strategic mistake by hiring too fast despite, as I pointed out when it went public in 2021, the brutally cyclical nature of the exchange business. And Three Arrows, a highly influential venture firm, appears to have been heavily invested in some of the most speculative and risky projects on the market.  I know it’s a terrible cliché, but it’s nonetheless true: All of this carnage is, in fact, the good news.  Back at it  While we’ll certainly see more unwinds, withdrawal freezes and mysterious silences over the next few weeks or even months, the market crash will be hardest on companies and investors who have made poor decisions. As crypto expanded and hype built over the past two years, fundamentally worthless projects proliferated, minting their own ephemeral tokens and convincing uninformed retail traders and high-profile veteran hedge fund managers alike that they had value.  This sort of garbage has crept into crypto during every expansion cycle. The current downturn is the holy cleansing flame that will eliminate it, in the same way that an old-growth forest needs a good fire every once in a while to renew itself. Getting rid of fake trash built on hype and a cult of personality means that, while there may be less money sloshing around for the next year or so, a much higher proportion of that will go to credible projects.  Capital is available  Those who are looking to build something based on a solid idea will thrive in this environment – especially because, unlike in 2018, it seems likely there will still be substantial venture capital available. As an example, consider that OpenSea, which generated $20 billion in NFT sales in 2021, was founded in 2017, with a lot of building through 2018 and 2019. That was not just during a fallow period for crypto, it was before most people had heard the term non-fungible token.  See also: 6 Reasons for Optimism This Crypto Winter | Opinion  There will be other OpenSeas, other Ethereum Name Services (ENS), other genuinely useful and profitable services or technologies developed during the coming bear market (OK, I’m ready to call it a “crypto winter” now). The best way to survive, or thrive, will be to do that building and position yourself to reap the benefits during the next big surge.  And remember that these downturns are always shorter than they seem.

A digital euro refers to a central bank digital currency (&apos;CBDC&apos;), a digital representation of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro.

42423112,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2MvVh,1655310654,Blockchain Security Firm Forta Introduces Native Token,"Blockchain security firm Forta introduced a native token, FORT, to provide an incentive to secure the network. Forta was born from blockchain security startup OpenZeppelin late last year with a $23 million fundraise led by Andreessen Horowitz.  Smart contract security broadly breaks down into pre-deployment checks and post-deployment runtime security, which includes real-time monitoring. Forta belongs to the latter category, adding incident and emergency response functions.  “I think a great analogy for Forta is a giant security camera and alarm system for Web 3. But we're a decentralized security camera and alarm system,” Andrew Beal, Forta’s lead ecosystem developer, told CoinDesk in an interview.  The Forta network has two components: bots and nodes. Bots are snippets of code that developers write to look for specific problems and send out alerts; they act as small, specialized security cameras. Nodes are essentially software dedicated to running the bots against each block of transactions on the supported blockchains.  Forta allows any developer in the ecosystem to publish and run a bot for free. Node runners have been manually brought into the system in the past, a process that's changing with the token launch.  The FORT token will now be required for a node runner, who will have to stake it as a security measure. If the runner does something malicious, the staked tokens will be slashed. Runners with below-average performance can also suffer a financial penalty.  Forta plans to introduce developer staking to discourage the submission of spam or malicious bots.  Holders of FORT will be able to use the token to vote on governance proposals. Forta recently held its first vote to nominate a seven-member governance council to help guide the network until it moves to fully decentralized decisions.  FORT has a 1 billion total supply right now, Beal said. Forta isn’t currently contemplating any inflation, or continuous issuance of the token over time, but Beal said it’s “not out of the realm of possibility in the future.”  Beal said Forta hasn’t publicly shared a token supply distribution plan, but he noted that it’s common in decentralized finance (DeFi) for roughly half of the token supply to be allocated to the community, set aside in the treasury and used for infrastructure growth. The other half goes to early investors, team members and advisors.  “We’re really excited to publicly launch FORT,” said Beal. “It signals that Forta is now a completely permissionless network.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/15/blockchain-security-firm-forta-introduces-native-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a907ae29c91885d8f75a3e3187a6bd5e161b2aa2-1137x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The wallet providers say there is no evidence the vulnerability was ever exploited by attackers, meaning no user funds are known to have been affected.  MetaMask and Phantom – which discovered the bug based on a tip from blockchain security firm Halborn – informed at least 10 other browser-based hot wallets that they contained the same vulnerability. The full list of impacted – and patched – wallets is unclear at this time.  Although the vulnerability came with a narrow attack vector and there’s no evidence of it ever having been exploited by hackers, it highlights the inherent security risk of internet-connected hot wallets compared to more secure – albeit less-convenient – hardware wallets.  Should you be concerned?  MetaMask and Phantom are not recommending that most users take any action other than to update their browsers in order to ensure the wallets they are using are running the most up-to-date software versions.  According to the blog post from MetaMask you should only be concerned if you match all of the following conditions:  Your hard drive was not encrypted  You imported your Secret Recovery Phrase into a MetaMask extension on a device that is in possession of someone you do not trust, or your computer is compromised  You used the “Show Secret Recovery Phrase” checkbox to view your Secret Recovery Phrase on-screen during that import process  “If your computer is not physically secure from people you do not trust, we recommend you enable full disk encryption on your system,” according to the MetaMask blog post. “Additionally, you are not affected by this if your funds are managed by a hardware wallet.”  Phantom’s blog post largely echoed that of MetaMask.  In its blog post, MetaMask outlines steps that users should take to move to a new wallet if they believe their credentials could have been compromised.  Halborn, which was rewarded a $50,000 bounty for disclosing the bug, recommended most users swap over to a new wallet address out of an abundance of caution.  Steve Walbroehl, Halborn’s co-founder, told CoinDesk, “Just given the fact that this is something that has been around for so long, you don’t know who possibly could have gotten [exploited]. Maybe you clicked on a bad phishing email and they have access to your machine. Maybe somebody took it before even though you’ve now upgraded. I just think out of an abundance of caution, given the criticality, it’s better to just change it.”  He continued, “My number one recommendation is to just get a hardware wallet.”  How it happened  The vulnerability resulted from a quirk in the javascript programming language that sometimes led to a user’s secret recovery phrase being stored in a user’s local memory for some period of time (exactly how long is unknown and likely varies by device).  If a user entered this phrase on a compromised or otherwise untrusted device, an attacker would have had the ability to swipe it from memory if he or she knew exactly where to look (or, more likely, had a specialized tool for the task).  A secret recovery phrase – also called a seed phrase or mnemonic phrase – is a series of 12 words that users receive when they set up a smart wallet, and it serves as a master key should users ever need to recover their wallet or set it up on a new device.  If a person’s secret recovery phrase falls into the hands of someone malicious, it could be used to seize full control of the person’s funds.  MetaMask was informed of the bug in July 2021 and issued a patch in March of this year. Phantom learned of the bug in September 2021 and issued several patches to address the issue between January and April 2022.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/15/metamask-phantom-and-other-browser-wallets-patch-security-vulnerability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/907c7f15c48f6e36e9418f7549f5eee9ca306afb-4085x3064.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The eurozone's central bank initiated a two-year investigation into a possible digital currency last July. While it has not said when it will decide on proceeding, Panetta, an ECB executive board member, has said he's optimistic a central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be ready for launch within four years.  A digital euro, if issued, would be capped at 1.5 trillion euros (US$1.6 trillion), Panetta told the committee. A concern with CBDCs is that consumers might keep all their money in the digital format, in effect depositing their entire savings with the central bank and starving consumer banks of the funds they require to lend to individuals and businesses.  ""Keeping total digital euro holdings between one trillion and one and a half trillion euro would avoid negative effects for the financial system and monetary policy,"" Panetta said in a statement. ""As the population of the euro area is currently around 340 million, this would allow for holdings of around 3,000 to 4,000 digital euro per capita.""  Referring to a consultation conducted by the European Commission last year, he said many responses were ""not enthusiastic, to put it mildly, about the digital euro.""  That's partly owing to the fact that few people understand what a digital euro is because ""it's complicated,"" he said.  Still, observers should not put too much weight on the findings, he said.  ""Our consultation has not been based on a representative sample of citizens,"" said Panetta. ""... So we have a very unbalanced sample of respondents.""

42393833,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBcRD,1655306136,"Crypto Market Chaos: No, Lido Is Not ‘the Next Terra’","So, uh, not sure if you’ve looked out the window at all today … but Ethereum (and DeFi and NFTs) might be on fire.  After last month’s $40 billion crash of the Terra blockchain ecosystem, a long list of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are facing renewed scrutiny this week from investors who believe the music has stopped for crypto products with risky – and in some cases, outright nonexistent – fundamentals.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The “number go up” party is over, retail investors are getting wiped out and billions in losses have been reported across big name balance sheets – fomenting fears that some of the biggest names in DeFi will be forced to liquidate their assets and dump on the market, pushing prices down even further.  Amid the turmoil, Lido Finance’s staked ether (stETH) – an Ethereum-based token representing ETH “staked” on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake Beacon Chain, is being closely watched. stETH, while not exactly “pegged” to the price of actual ETH, has traditionally traded at around the same price because stETH represents a 1:1 claim on ETH staked on the Beacon Chain.  Read more: Lido Briefly Becomes Top DeFi Protocol by TVL With $20B Staked  Today, stETH – which powers an increasingly large segment of DeFi’s borrowing, lending and casino-lite economy – is trading roughly 7% lower than the price of ETH. For those who held or borrowed stETH on the assumption that it and ETH are synonymous, this is a big haircut.  The stETH price drop has fueled some worries on Twitter and elsewhere that Lido is “the next Terra.” What if stETH, which represents around 33% of all staked ether (or around $5 billion), were to drop to zero?  Fortunately, such worries aren’t grounded in actual understanding of how stETH works under the hood.  In this week’s newsletter, we’ll talk a bit about what’s going on in the markets and what it means for stETH and Ethereum as a whole.  What the heck is going on?  Decentralized finance, which was born on Ethereum and then skyrocketed in popularity with the DeFi summer of 2020, set out to provide users with financial tools outside of the reach of regulators and centralized financial institutions. Coded smart contracts – not written contracts or company-controlled servers – would allow users to trade and transact without intermediaries.  Over time, DeFi has grown into a behemoth undergirding the entire crypto economy. But as DeFi success stories like Maker and Uniswap have provided new paradigms for users to borrow, lend and swap digital assets, high-leverage experiments like Olympus and Terra – which promised high yields to users in exchange for their faith in untested investment models – have crashed and burned.  Over the past months, as tokens associated with projects like Terra have fallen to zero, DeFi as a whole has also suffered. That suffering accelerated this week. CoinDesk reported Tuesday that crypto markets saw over $1 billion in liquidations in just 24 hours between Monday and Tuesday.  As Shaurya Malwa, my colleague on CoinDesk’s Markets desk, explained, “Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).”  A primary catalyst for this week’s liquidation chaos appears to have been massive sell-offs from Celsius – an investment product that allows users to easily deposit funds in exchange for market-leading yields. Behind the scenes, Celsius was able to offer high yearly returns up to around 20% by deploying user tokens into myriad DeFi protocols. Celsius would reward depositors with the profits it earned from these protocols, and it would shave off a percentage for itself.  Celsius was a crypto unicorn – raising $400 million in October from investors who believed it had the potential to revolutionize finance (and profit handsomely) by expanding consumer access to DeFi. It now faces criticism that its fund managers behaved like degens (crypto-speak for “degenerates”), swayed by the same eye-popping returns that pooled retailers into uncertain bets like the ill-fated Terra project.  Celsius was never fully transparent with how it deployed user funds behind the scenes, and a wave of sell-offs from the platform this week suggests it, as a result of some risky DeFi investments, is now verging on insolvency.  Celsius and Terra  One of the primary destinations for Celsius’ funds was Anchor – the lending platform that provided users up to 20% per year for deposits of Terra’s dollar-pegged UST stablecoin. The Block reported in May that Celsius deposited around $500 million into Anchor, which it quickly withdrew as Terra started to wobble. While its money was parked in Anchor, Celsius took some of the 20% yield for itself, and then built the rest of the yield into the interest it handed back to depositors.  Though Celsius reportedly withdrew from Anchor before UST imploded, the firm’s one-time involvement with the ill-fated Terra project – combined with a broader cooling (and now, crashing) of DeFi markets – has fueled suspicion that Celsius’ DeFi investments may have declined in value so much that the platform no longer has enough money to pay back its depositors.  The insolvency narrative seemed especially likely on Sunday, when Celsius sent an email to users informing them that it would be pausing all swaps, transfers and withdrawals in an effort to ensure it would be able to honor its commitments moving forward.  Moreover, a wave of recent sell-offs from Celsius suggests some market players that loaned out money to the platforms are now asking for that money back – something one would expect to see during a bear market. It appears likely that, in order to pay off its lenders, Celsius has been forced to sell off some of its largest positions. One of those positions was in stETH.  Understanding stETH  According to blockchain data, Celsius has nearly $500 million of Lido staked ether (stETH) locked up as collateral in stablecoin loans. It’s possible they have more elsewhere in their treasury.  The attention on stETH this month stems from the fact that it is no longer trading around 1:1 for ETH. Traditionally, ETH and stETH have traded around parity because each stETH represents a direct claim on ETH that Lido, a decentralized protocol, has staked on the Beacon Chain on behalf of its users.  The catch is that while Lido will happily hand out 1 stETH in exchange for 1 ETH, it does not yet allow users to pull their ETH back out of the protocol. This comes down to a limitation with Ethereum itself: ETH staked on the Beacon Chain will be impossible to withdraw until an update following Ethereum’s “Merge” into a proof-of-stake network (today, Ethereum continues to operate using the more energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism pioneered by Bitcoin).  The main point of a “liquid staking” solution like Lido was to provide users a way to stake, secure the network and earn interest for doing so without losing the ability to use and trade staked assets. (It also allows users to participate in staking without the need to put up 32 ETH — which is what’s required if you are setting up a node by yourself.)  Read more: 'Staked Ether' Becomes Focus of Crypto Stress, From Celsius to Three Arrows  With so much stETH held by Celsius, there’s some fear that the troubled firm may be forced to sell off its stETH to stay afloat (if it hasn’t done so already). This would have the effect of depressing the overall stETH market.  Andrew Thurman of blockchain analytics firm Nansen (and a former CoinDesk colleague) told Decrypt this week that Celsius “sent thousands of stETH to FTX in recent days, presumably to sell, though we can't verify that because it's off-chain … They have likely been especially hard-hit by stETH losing its peg to ETH.”  Concerns that Celsius (and other firms) will be forced to dump more stETH, combined with sales from other stETH holders anxious to cash out during the bear market, may have helped to cause stETH to drop 7% below the price of ETH this week.  Although stETH and ETH should eventually be interchangeable, some holders appear desperate enough to exit their positions that they’ve been willing to trade stETH at a steep discount.  Can stETH enter a death spiral?  The uncoupling of stETH from ETH has provoked questions as to whether Lido is “the next Terra,” but this is not an apples-to-apples comparison.  First off, while Terra's UST stablecoin was “pegged” to the price of $1, stETH was never pegged to the price of ETH.  So long as stETH is not redeemable for ETH, there’s nothing guaranteeing the two should sell at the same price until they are interchangeable.  “The price of [Lido] staked ETH prices in some risk of not doing the Merge, some risk of [Ethereum not allowing] withdraws, and some opportunity cost of having your ether locked up for along time,” Ben Edgington, product lead at Ethereum development firm ConsenSys, told CoinDesk.  According to Edgington, unless you believe ether is going to zero or you think it will never successfully merge into a proof-of-stake network, you can rest easy knowing you can wait it out and eventually trade stETH back for ETH.  UST, on the other hand, was supposed to be pegged to exactly one dollar based on a complex dance with LUNA, its sister token.  But because of the mechanics underpinning this relationship, a drop in UST’s price would cause LUNA’s supply to inflate and its price to decrease. And the same thing happened the other way around – when LUNA’s price decreased enough, UST ultimately struggled to maintain its $1 peg.  READ MORE: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA  The drop in Terra wasn’t merely a case of market sentiment gone bad. It was accelerated by an underlying mechanism that forced UST and LUNA into a “death spiral” to zero under certain conditions.  The relationship between stETH and ETH does not have the sort of feedback loops that doomed Terra.  The people selling stETH at a discount to ETH either need to cash out now (like Celsius needing to pay off loans), or figure ETH’s price will be lower than it is today even after The Merge. Even if it trades at a discount to ETH currently, stETH is unlikely to crash (similar to Terra) unless ether itself crashes.  The price of ETH in PoS  While all of this market talk may feel like a sideshow for an Ethereum protocol-focused newsletter, Edgington explains that the price of ether, which is down 67% year to date, becomes relevant in a proof-of-stake system.  READ MORE: What is Proof of Stake?  As Edgington puts it, “Proof-of-stake is fundamentally different from proof-of-work in terms of its security model. We can put a very clear cost on attacking the chain.”  He continued, “The dirty secret of proof-of-work is that it can be costless to attack the chain, because if you win a 51% attack, you can actually make a profit, assuming that nothing too bad happens to the coin price … smaller chains have come under attack and their coin price has been flat.”  In a proof-of-stake system, says Edgington, “an attack would cost a minimum of a third of all ether staked – so that would be like 4 million ETH today.” (Side note: This is around how much Lido controls, though it spreads its stake between different parties responsible for validating the network).  In a world where ether has a relatively high price, the cost of attack will also be high – hence why developers like Edgington argue it is more secure. Of course, this also works in the other direction. If the price of ether drops low enough, an attack will be cheaper.

Oracle's protocols like Chainlink are third-party services that fetch data from outside a blockchain to within it, ensuring the input data is verifiable and free from errors. Such a service is required as blockchains and blockchain-based applications can function as immutable stores of data, but can’t independently verify the correctness of the input data.  Meanwhile, Derek Yoo, founder of Moonbeam Network, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that the Chainlink integration was a sought-after feature by the Moonbeam community.  “Chainlink was a top requested feature from our community, and with the integration in place, friction is further reduced for developers building DeFi and other use cases,” Yoo said, acknowledging Chainlink as a “reliable oracle service.”  Moonbeam-based protocols already using Chainlink include Moonwell Artemis, a collateralized lending protocol on Moonbeam, which is using Chainlink Price Feeds to power lending and borrowing with price data from a wide range of tokens available on the Polkadot ecosystem, including DOT.  Moonbeam developers can get started with Chainlink Price Feeds on Polkadot from today through Moonbeam's developer documentation.",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | LINK | TRADING | BEAM,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/15/embargo-wednesday-june-15-1000-10am-et-2pm-utc-chainlink-price-feeds-are-live-on-polkadot-based-moonbeam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fea7a48a050caec2b3da4fa46e62f4b99250cdf0-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.)  Price point: Bitcoin slides toward $20K, a price level not seen since 2020, as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to jack up interest rates.  Market Moves: Distress is spreading across the crypto industry, with pain felt from the crypto lender Celsius to the hedge fund Three Arrows. The celebrity investor Kevin O'Leary tells CoinDesk that, ""We need someone to go to zero.""  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) neared $20,000 in European hours Wednesday, sliding toward a crucial psychological level not seen since 2020, as distress spread across crypto and traditional markets.  The price of the largest cryptocurrency by market value has now declined for nine straight days, a record losing streak in pricing data going back to the early 2010s.  Turmoil in traditional markets pushed the European Central Bank to hold a rare, unscheduled meeting on Wednesday to discuss rising borrowing costs. (And markets quickly bounced on the news.) In a statement, the ECB promised to ""apply flexibility"" in its campaign to tighten monetary conditions, in light of the ""current market situation.""  The U.S. Federal Reserve is scheduled to conclude its latest closed-door meeting on monetary policy with a statement at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, and bond traders now fully expect a 0.75 percentage point interest-rate hike, the biggest since the 1990s. (Officials are expected to publish an update of their closely tracked ""Summary of Economic Predictions,"" known colloquially as the ""dot plot."")  Sentiment among investors remains bearish, CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa reported.  “Concerns around a sharp tightening of monetary policy are weighing on financial markets and are trickling down into cryptocurrencies through their influence on large institutional investors,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an FxPro senior market analyst, said in an email to CoinDesk. “It is not surprising that bitcoin and ether are dragging the entire cryptocurrency market down in such an environment.""  Read More: 'Staked Ether' Becomes Focus of Crypto Stress, From Celsius to Three Arrows     Market moves  The rapid tightening of monetary conditions – part of a push by central bankers to tamp down fast-rising inflation – has sucked liquidity out of crypto markets, and now cracks are appearing across the industry.  Crypto lender Celsius paused all withdrawals earlier this week, citing ""extreme market conditions,"" leading to questions about the firm’s liquidity. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Celsius has hired lawyers specializing in business restructuring to help it navigate its thorny financial situation.  Prominent crypto fund Three Arrows Capital faced at least $400 million in liquidations and scrambled to lower its collateral levels by selling key positions. The Block reported Wednesday that Three Arrows Capital, popularly known as 3AC, has faced liquidations by crypto lending firms and is in the process of repaying lenders and counterparties.  Coinbase (COIN) and other big crypto firms are laying off thousands of employees, and analysts are on the hunt for fresh signs of distress. Those include scouring arcane market indicators like the ""stETH discount,"" CoinDesk's Krisztian Sandor reported.  Some firms are coming out proactively with self-assessments of good health (or innocence in the eyes of traders).  Tether, the issuer of the popular dollar-linked stablecoin USDT, denied claims that its commercial paper portfolio is 85% backed by Chinese or Asian commercial paper, as reported by CoinDesk's Jamie Crawley.  Tether described certain rumors to this effect as ""completely false and likely spread to induce further panic in order to generate additional profits from an already stressed market,"" in an announcement on Wednesday.  'Go to zero'  According to FSInsights, an analysis firm, the combination of macro headwinds and over-leveraged yield strategies has resulted in the forced selling of cryptocurrencies in the last few days, wiping more than $200 billion in value from the digital asset market, Will Canny reported.  The “takedown of terraUSD (UST) and Celsius is long-term constructive for the industry,” wrote the head of digital asset strategy, Sean Farrell.  “Such public displays of ignorant capital destruction are often overlooked in the traditional finance industry (or take a very long time to unwind),” his note said. Fortunately, he wrote, crypto markets have the benefit of “iterating and improving at a more rapid pace.""  The prevailing sense in the market, though, is that there's plenty of pain still to come.  The celebrity investor Kevin O’Leary says he isn’t ready to call a bottom in the crypto sector short of a major negative occurrence.  “You don’t get a bottom until you have an event,” O’Leary told CoinDesk this week. “In the crypto world, we need someone to go to zero.”     Latest headlines  Celsius Troubles, UST Collapse Could Have Long-Term Benefits for Crypto, FSInsight Says The crypto lender was notorious for promoting risk-free yields on client assets, the report said.  Kevin O'Leary Says ‘Panic Event’ Is Needed Before Crypto Bottoms Kevin O’Leary spoke to CoinDesk ahead of the move to the Toronto Stock Exchange of WonderFi, the crypto marketplace in which he’s a strategic investor.

Looking at the realities of the market now, this price level is a matter of time. Starting in September 2021, the HBAR price has fallen by almost 90%. The whole fall wave took place at low volumes compared to the volumes during the growth wave. The only exception is the weekly candle from 9 May. HBAR trading volumes increased during this week. This interest of buyers was not realized - there was no rebound. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/NY78HWUO/ Therefore, the price continued to fall at its usual low volumes. So far, there is a similar trend in the HBAR market - buying cryptocurrency is quite dangerous. So far, the BTC price shows no signs of strength and the probability of continuing to fall below $20,000 is still high. Thus, we would not recommend considering a cryptocurrency for investment earlier than $0.05 per HBAR. Buyers had been in this price range during the whole of 2020. Only in January 2021, the HBAR price was able to break the mark of $0.05 up. Given the importance of this price level, we will expect a rebound from the first target of $0.13. This rebound can be very fast and will be accompanied by knocking out of the positions of sellers. That&apos;s why, when buying HBAR, we recommend that you place limit orders for sale in the range of $0.13 in advance.

Nansen Connect's primary feature, according to the company, is full blockchain compatibility and analytical access. Making the blockchain data of users widely available will encourage community building and developer accountability, said Nansen.  The transparency should help reduce scams such as the Discord moderator hacks that have befallen the Bored Ape non-fungible token (NFT) community.  The company said Nansen Connect will also allow users to log in via their crypto wallets, select a username based on their Nansen wallet labels and join groups based on crypto holdings and on-chain behaviors.  “While certain Web 2 platforms can be used to token-gate communities, they rely on plugins and are rife with problems,” Paul Harwood, a Nansen product manager, said in the statement. The app is intended to be a “secure, crypto-native method for users and groups to explore the frontiers of Web 3 communication.”  Nansen subscribers and holders of certain NFTs will initially be eligible to join the company. This includes Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Azuki, Clonex, Doodles, and Moonbirds. Collections that have agreed to use Nansen Connect as their official communication platform include Pudgy Penguins, KajiuKingz, Cyberkongz, Hashmasks, Parallel, and other.

29947,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=493130,1655289559,What Makes Deflationary Tokens a Preferred Choice in the Crypto Market: A Case Study of CET’s Repurchase & Burning Mechanism,"In the crypto market, though most cryptocurrencies share similar underlying technologies, they are designed based on different economic models known as tokenomics. To be more specific, some cryptos feature a supply that increases over time, while some others have a fixed supply. Yet, a minority of cryptos come with a diminishing total supply that looks deflationary. Such tokens are referred to as deflationary cryptos. We all know that some cryptos with a fixed supply, such as Bitcoin, are generally deflationary by default. Most members of the Bitcoin community reject inflation because it often represents a loss of value. For instance, a real-world currency issued by the government often controls the entire financial system of the country. If a government frequently issues a large supply of currency via the central bank while setting low interest rates and buying a huge amount of foreign bonds, the country will be prone to a credit crisis and even worse an economic depression. Before publishing the BTC whitepaper, Satoshi Nakamoto had noticed that real-world currencies issued by the government are subject to inflation, which inspired him to develop an alternative store of value that&apos;s similar to precious metals but is achieved digitally. Bitcoin&apos;s flexible mining difficulty and mining reward mechanisms help it suppress inflation. Meanwhile, the unique design of Bitcoin continues to drive up its value.

At the same time, abandoning confidentiality contradicts the core concept of digital assets. To satisfy interests of both cryptocurrency users and regulators, a trade-off was needed. The solution has already been created. Let&apos;s dive deeper and learn how to remain anonymous in the crypto market without breaking a single law. What is KYC and what does it have to do with cryptocurrencies? The abbreviation KYC stands for Know Your Customer. This definition is often used in the context of the financial market. KYC refers to a range of processes aimed at ascertaining the identity of the person who plans to conduct a financial transaction. Cryptocurrencies are a financial instrument that, by the covenant of the founder of Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto, should be anonymous. From regulators&apos; point of view, fully confidential transactions carry risks associated with money laundering, terrorist funding, and other illegal activities. That is why governing authorities need to pipe cryptocurrencies&apos; users through KYC procedures. Crypto market participants are also interested in having convenience for all parties — users and regulators — relating norms for person identification.

The “takedown of terraUSD (UST) and Celsius is long-term constructive for the industry,” Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at FSInsight, wrote in the report.  Last month, Terraform Labs' two tokens, terraUSD and luna, collapsed, and last week, crypto lender Celsius Network paused all withdrawals, swaps and transfer because of the extreme market conditions.  “Such public displays of ignorant capital destruction are often overlooked in the traditional finance industry (or take a very long time to unwind),” the note said, although it also noted that crypto markets have the benefit of “iterating and improving at a more rapid pace.  ”In regard to Celsius, if yield generation strategies are too good to be true, that is because they probably are,"" FSInsight said, adding that the crypto lender was “notorious for promoting ‘risk-free’ yields on client assets” that required huge amounts of leverage coupled with risky and illiquid staking mechanisms.  The difference between assets that are owned and that are held in custody becomes evident only during times of market distress, the report said, and many Celsius users who thought they owned their assets found themselves unable to withdraw during this period of increased market volatility, FSInsight added.  “In a tight environment, leverage becomes a dangerous double-edged sword that can strike when you least expect,” the note read.  FSInsight says it is still ""constructive"" on crypto prices in the second half of the year and this is the time for medium- to long-term investors to consider allocating to bitcoin (BTC) more aggressively.

WonderFi and Canada  O’Leary spoke to CoinDesk ahead of WonderFi's June 22 move to the Toronto Stock Exchange from Canada’s NEO Exchange. WonderFi, a crypto marketplace and registered trading platform, counts O’Leary and FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried as strategic investors.  O’Leary credits the move to the company’s enhanced oversight and compliance, as well as the work it's done with regulators on listing new coins and services. He said Canada’s crypto industry doesn’t allow for excess leverage, meaning WonderFi clients aren’t as at risk of margin calls.  Institutions, family offices or individual investors “need to know with certainty that they're not trading on a rogue platform,” O'Leary said. “Completely compliant infrastructure” is necessary.  O’Leary thinks global jurisdictions have taken – and should take – note of Canada’s crypto policy. “When you walk in with a Canadian flag on your back and you start talking about compliant crypto, people listen,” O’Leary said.

Crypto lender Celsius paused all withdrawals earlier this week citing ""extreme market conditions,"" leading to questions about the firm’s liquidity. Prominent crypto fund Three Arrows faced at least $400 million in liquidations and scrambled to lower its collateral levels by selling key positions Wednesday morning, as reported.  Bitcoin fell to just above the $22,000 level in U.S. hours Tuesday. The decline gathered pace Wednesday morning, with the cryptocurrency sliding under $21,000, dropping for the eighth consecutive day and losing 30% over the past week.  The asset traded reached as low as $20,169 this morning, a level that was previously seen in mid-2020 and marked bitcoin highs in late 2017.  Current sentiment among investors remains bearish.  “Concerns around a sharp tightening of monetary policy are weighing on financial markets and are trickling down into cryptocurrencies through their influence on large institutional investors,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an FxPro senior market analyst, said in an email to CoinDesk. “It is not surprising that bitcoin and ether are dragging the entire cryptocurrency market down in such an environment.""  The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for May showed inflation in the world's biggest economy hit 8.6% on a year-on-year basis, 0.3 percentage points more than the expected 8.3% level. The data sent global markets downward earlier this week, as investors priced in further rate increases as the Federal Reserve (Fed) tries to bring prices under control.  The fall in equity prices comes as traders expect companies to report lower revenues and consumer spending. Furthermore, some observers expect central bank actions to further impact bitcoin prices.  “Over the past couple of years, cryptocurrencies have become a global macro asset,” said Mikkel Morch, executive director at crypto hedge fund ARK36, in an email. “So it is to be expected that they will react negatively now when investors realize that central banks haven’t reacted nearly as aggressively as they will need to in order to get inflation under control.”  “The global economic environment is becoming extremely tough to navigate for investors involved in all kinds of markets, so it is no surprise that bitcoin is also facing increased downward pressure,” Morch said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/15/bitcoin-drops-toward-20k-amid-contagion-risks-in-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62977461176f7c8fe63daf656aaa0b40b8154b4b-1998x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Key technical points: The market price has decreased 2.06% over the past 24 hours. The price action shows a selling spree ready to take down $0.10. The 24-hour trading volume of Stellar is $206 Million, indicating a drop of 36%. Past Performance of XLM XLM prices maintain a falling trend as it fails to surpass the 50-day EMA and the $0.148 resistance level. The rejection coincides with the sell-off in global markets resulting in a 30% downfall, breaking under the $0.11 support level to take a dip at $0.10. However, the selling pressure cools off resulting in a sideways trend between $0.10 and $0.11 as a retest of the bearish breakout. Source- Tradingview XLM Technical Analysis The currently forming XLM daily candle shows a rise in selling sentiment as the price drop 5% and undermines the last day&apos;s recovery. Hence, traders can expect the fallout of $0.10 as an entry point for shorting opportunities.

Three Arrows, popularly known as 3AC, was liquidated by crypto lending firms and is currently in the process of repaying lenders and other counterparties, according to the report.  The firm’s founders, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, were two of the most vocal participants in the crypto markets in the past few years, making bets on non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, layer 1 blockchain tokens and cryptocurrency companies.  Zhu seemed to address rumors on Twitter this morning. “We are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out,” he said, without giving specifics.  Tokens listed as investments on the 3AC site include ether (ETH), solana (SOL), and luna (LUNA). Prices of these are down 77%, 90% and 99.7%, respectively, since lifetime highs, as per CoinGecko data.  3AC’s troubles come amid reports that crypto lender Celsius may be insolvent. The firm managed billions of dollars of user funds and may not possess enough capital to pay out investors.  One of these strategies Celsius used involved the usage of staked ether (stETH), a derivative tied to the ether that lost its peg and could have caused contagion risks, as reported.  Meanwhile, on-chain data suggests 3AC is selling its existing crypto positions to lower collateral requirements for certain positions.

The funding will help scale the core product, which helps developers quickly launch NFT applications.  “We’re one of the biggest NFT infrastructure providers. You can think of us as the Stripe or AWS [Amazon Web Services] for NFTs,” NFTPort CEO and co-founder Johannes Tammekänd told CoinDesk in an interview.  “One of the core problem[s] companies and developers face in building NFT products is a lack of proper infrastructure,” continued Tammekänd, who has a background in cybersecurity and turned to blockchain technology in 2014 while researching Tor and Bitcoin in NATO. “Our infrastructure brings their goods to market down from months to days or even hours and saves them hundreds of thousands of dollars.”  The funding will help Estonia-based NFTPort expand to new blockchains, add new functionality and scale up the team, Tammekänd told CoinDesk in an interview. The startup also plans to bring a decentralized NFT infrastructure protocol to market.  Taavet+Sten is the investment vehicle of Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of digital payment firm Wise, and Sten Tamkivi, co-founder of city comparison tool Teleport. Tamkivi will join the NFTPort team as a co-founder. Rain Johanson, former CTO of Bolt, will join on as co-founder and CTO.  Other investors in the round included Filecoin creator Protocol Labs, Polygon co-founder Jaynti Kanani and Polkadot co-founder Jutta Steiner, among others.  NFTPort infrastructure includes application programming interfaces (APIs) for data, minting and counterfeit detection. Data APIs provide access to NFT data from the Ethereum, Polygon and Solana blockchains. Minting APIs let developers deploy, manage and customize NFT smart contracts without writing any smart contract code. The counterfeit detection interface cross-checks that an NFT wasn’t previously minted on any of the supported blockchains.  Developers already using NFTPort include Nifty Gateway, part of crypto exchange Gemini, and Protocol Labs.  “We have high conviction in a shift towards increased digital ownership powered by NFT technology, and the potential for NFTs to become a new asset class,” said Atomico partner Irina Haivas in the press release. “However, a lot of the infrastructure required to underpin the widespread adoption of NFTs and other Web 3 technologies still needs to be built, and this is where NFTPort comes in.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MATIC | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/15/stripe-for-nfts-nftport-raises-26m-series-a,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f04beea7c0d02a01281fadec9a3149954bff6a5e-5700x3800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In this article, we will discuss cryptocurrency money laundering typologies and the cryptocurrency money laundering case study of the Coincheck hacking incident and others. Cryptocurrency Money Laundering Typologies Those who examine their blockchain transactions will look for several things. One such typology to look at is the use of non-compliant crypto exchanges. In this case, the criminal party is frequently attempting to &apos;clean up&apos; an illegitimate funding source by trading it for cash or other cryptocurrencies. For instance, Payza, an unregulated exchange, laundered $250 million through altcoins and Bitcoin, as discovered by the US Department of Justice in 2018. Cross-wallet activity by the same customer multiple times is also among cryptocurrency money laundering typologies that help launder money through the dark web or via offshore gambling. It highlights suspicious behavior than illegal activity, though.

The Federal Election Commission Regulations Regarding Campaign Donations Cryptocurrency is the new normal and how the Federal Election Commission regulates the use of crypto in campaigns contributes majorly to its use. Crypto donation platform called Crowdpac was launched in 2014 but clocking it in is tedious. These assets need to be converted to dollars before they become ready to spend. This process, in turn, incurs a processing fee, thereby reducing its cost-effectiveness. In that sense, crypto donations prove to be more complex in contrast to their cash and credit counterparts.

These hedge funds employ complex investment strategies to yield financial returns that surpass the general market. Complex portfolio-building procedures and composite risk management methods allow investors to invest without needing proficiency in finance and cryptocurrencies. Understanding a Crypto Hedge Fund Crypto is an investment instrument that is relatively new and still in its infancy. It is a very high-risk and speculative asset that isn&apos;t backed or regulated by governments like a fiat currency. Cryptos are also very volatile, making hedge funds based on them even more volatile than hedge funds focussing on other investment instruments. However, it is a very lucrative investment making it attractive to hedge fund investors. Novelty and lack of regulation cause new crypto tokens to pop up constantly. Bitcoin persists as the standard, followed by Ethereum in market establishment and utility. Dogecoin is an outlier with a unique fan base driving its growth and volatility.

42394041,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bucjFD,1655257126,Swan Bitcoin CEO Calls Celsius Withdrawal Freeze ‘So Opaque’,"Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten has a problem with Celsius.  He believes the crypto lending platform, which sparked his interest following the collapse of the terraUSD luna (UST) stablecoin, has not been forthcoming about its vulnerabilities and misled investors.  “It’s so opaque what’s going on in Celsius,” Klippsten said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program Tuesday, a day after Celsius’s announcement that it would freeze withdrawals due to “extreme market conditions.”  Celsius’s problems have led to widespread fears about crypto’s future and contributed to the four-day free fall in prices to two-year lows.  Read more: Crypto Lending Service Celsius Pauses Withdrawals, Citing 'Extreme Market Conditions'  Klippsten said Celsius first sparked his interest last May, and that his concerns about its model and what he considers false promises have increased.  By Friday, May 13, days after the news of Terra’s fall, Celsius announced that it had pulled half a billion dollars worth of user funds from Terra’s Anchor Protocol, news that rippled throughout the cryptocurrency industry.  ""That was really stunning to hear,” Klippsten said. “That a professional risk management team had even bothered to be playing with an obvious Ponzi scheme like luna and furthermore, to be pulling it out a day before the collapse.""  This isn’t Celsius’s first encounter with controversy. In December of last year, it lost nearly $55 million dollars, or about 896 of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), after BadgerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, was hacked for upwards of $120 million.  Klippsten adds that Celsius kept parking user funds in obscure no-name decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which are risky and not good at operations. “It’s a big, big, big red flag.”  In April, Celsius banned new transfers by non-accredited investors on its U.S. platform, limiting who could add new assets and earn rewards. Nearly five months prior, the crypto lending firm had to replace its former chief financial officer, Yaron Shalem, after Shalem was arrested “for committing fraudulent offenses in the field of cryptocurrencies.”  The business model dilemma  Celsius’ marketing has been misleading , Klippsten added. “They make it sound like a better bank, and they make it sound like a high yield savings account,” he said.  The peer-to-peer platform is intended to facilitate crypto lending, and attracts users by returning 80% of its revenue to users in rewards, while the firm used the remaining 20% to fund the project’s expansion.  Celsius users are more likely to be unsecured lenders, Klippsten notes. “You're an unsecured creditor, and they can do whatever they want with your coins out the back end, essentially trading it like a hedge fund. You don't have any rights to your coins,” he said.  Read more: Nexo Proposes Celsius Buyout as Rival Lending Platform Halts Withdrawals  Yet, Klippsten said that crypto lending models are not inherently troubled. For those who must seek yield, “there’s definitely going to be a spectrum, and there will be some that are much more transparent,” he said, adding that those better managed platforms are likely to have “much stronger risk management, and frankly, lower yields on offer. You have to make that choice for yourself.”  Celsius’s freeze on withdrawals and transfers, and earlier terraUSD debacle could be a wake-up call, allowing investors to see the fallacy of a risk-free, high-yield product.  Celsius’s CEL token was recently trading at about 64 cents, according to CoinMarketCap data, placing the firm’s market capitalization just above $161 million.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/15/swan-bitcoin-ceo-calls-celsius-withdrawal-freeze-so-opaque,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/914c8689c9ac9e5b400326351495bb490b4ab636-2048x1095.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415389,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDV35E,1655256031,"Coinbase Lays Off Around 1,100 Employees","Coinbase Global (COIN) is laying off around 1,100 employees as part of a cost cutting plan, the company said in a filing on Tuesday. Coinbase initially said in May it was paring back its hiring plans and then later said it would rescind new job offers.  The latest plan involves cutting the workforce by around 18% as of June 10, after which it will have around 5,000 total employees as of the end of the current quarter, the company said, adding that it expects the plan to be executed by the end of the second quarter. Coinbase estimated it would incur $40 million to $45 million in total restructuring expenses.  On Tuesday morning, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong published a note that was shared with all employees.  ""We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom,"" Armstrong stated, before alluding to the potential of another crypto winter.  The note concedes that the company ""grew too quickly"" in the cryptocurrency bull market, scaling from 1,250 employees at the start of 2021.  Outgoing Coinbase employees received the news in their personal email addresses after access was cut from Coinbase systems, according to the note.  Coinbase shares are down almost 80% this year as the sharp decline in crypto prices has hurt the exchange's transaction volumes. On Tuesday morning, shares of Coinbase rose about 1% in pre-market trading after the layoff news was announced. However, in regular trading shares were down about 3% to $50.40.  In response to the announcement, Mizuho lowered its 2022 revenue estimates for Coinbase and reduced its price target from $60 to $45. It said it was concerned cutting workers could hurt efforts to find new revenue streams, potentially leading to a pricing war with rivals as competition rises.  Coinbase is the latest in a slew of crypto companies to announce job cuts. On Monday, lending platform BlockFi reduced its headcount by 20% and crypto exchange Crypto.com said it would cut about 260 jobs. Prior to that, the Winklevoss-led exchange and custodian Gemini announced it was cutting 10% of its workforce, and Middle Eastern exchange Rain said it was cutting dozens of jobs.  The cryptocurrency market is enduring its deepest correction for more than two years, with bitcoin trading at $22,150, 68% lower than its all-time high of about $69,000 reached last November.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and Ether continue to struggle.  Insights: Crypto traders are pessimistic about bitcoin's future pricing.  Technician's take: In place of the Technician's Take, First Mover Asia is republishing a Consensus 2022-related column by columnist Daniel Kuhn on Pussy Riot founding member Nadya Tolokonnikova.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.

Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $21,985 -1.8%  Ether (ETH): $1,201 -0.4%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Chainlink LINK +14.4% Computing Solana SOL +7.1% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM +6.1% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC −3.4% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM −2.7% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin BTC −1.5% Currency  Bitcoin and Ether Continue to Struggle  The day after the biggest crypto crash in two years brought little relief.  Digital assets continued to flounder Tuesday in a whirlwind of inflation fears and economic uncertainty with bitcoin and ether in a red muck for much of the day, and other cryptos struggling to regain ground they lost in Monday's dramatic sell-off.  Bitcoin was recently trading below $22,000 down roughly 2% during the last 24 hours. The decline was bitcoin's eighth consecutive day of losses. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has now dropped nearly 30% of its value over the past month and is threatening to test the not-long-ago unthinkable idea of support below $20,000, roughly where it stood in 2017.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at roughly $1,200, about flat from Monday when it hit a more than 18-month low. Among altcoins, SOL and XLM were recently up more than 5% after plunging on Monday, but WBTC and TRX continued to suffer with the latter off by over 13% at one point.  Crypto investors are nervously awaiting the U.S. central bank latest interest rate increase, which many observers now believe will be 75 basis points, harsh, inflationary medicine that seemed unlikely until the Consumer Price Index showed inflation continuing at four-year highs. Whether hawkish policy can tame inflation without sparking a recession remains uncertain.  ""Bitcoin traders better be buckled up heading into the FOMC decision,"" Oanda senior analyst Americas Edward Moya wrote in an email. Bitcoin is still holding the $20,000 level and if Wall Street gets a very hawkish decision and press conference, Treasury yields and the dollar could surge once again and that would test the line in the sand many crypto traders have drawn.""  Stocks were calmer on Tuesday after the previous day's battering with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq all about flat. Gold, a traditional safe haven asset, was also down, however, a reminder of the degree of skittishness among investors.  ""Wall Street was quick to fade the morning rebound that stemmed a modest improvement with producer prices, possibly providing some hope that core inflation continues to ease for businesses,"" Moya wrote.  Meanwhile, bad news and disturbing trends continued to plague crypto markets, with exchange giant Coinbase announcing the layoff of about 18% of its workforce – some 1,100 jobs. The cuts were the latest among major exchanges, following those in recent days by Winklevoss twins-led Gemini, Middle Eastern-based Rain Financial and Latin America-based Bitso and Buenbit.  Data on Tuesday also showed that crypto-tracked futures had lost over $1 billion over a 24-hour period, a victim of the fraught investment environment. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Also late Tuesday, Fox Business reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating whether crypto exchanges have sufficient protections against insider trading. The SEC has sent a letter to a major crypto exchange inquiring about its safeguards and comes amid increasing scrutiny of the terraUSD stablecoin implosion and more widely, according to the report.  Oanda's Moya was pessimistic about crypto's prospects going forward. ""If bitcoin breaks below the $20,000 level, support might not emerge until the $17,000 level,"" he wrote. ""Another crypto plunge might not see major support until the 2019 summer high around the $14,000 level.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,735 -0.3%  DJIA: 30,364 -0.5%  Nasdaq: 10,828 +0.1%  Gold: $1,808 -0.6%  Insights  Traders See Bitcoin Dropping Below $20,000  Bitcoin stabilized Tuesday at about $22,000 after crumbling Monday amid inflation fears and wider macroeconomic weakness. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had followed major Asian indices which continued their own recent spiral, closing at least 1% lower.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.32% as the yen tumbled to its lowest level against the dollar since 1998. The currency has declined 15% this year, becoming one of the worst-performing major currencies. Meanwhile, stocks in Tokyo slid the most since March and bond yields hit ceiling values, the Japan Times reported.  The decline came after the U.S. released poorer-than-expected inflation data for May in a report last week, which saw inflation increase by 8.6% compared to last year. Traders are now pricing in rate hikes of over 175 basis points through September, which is expected to bring down company revenues and slow down consumer spending.  “The crux of the concern plaguing investors is how harshly the [U.S. Federal Reserve] plans to tackle rising inflation in the face of stark new [consumer price index] data,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, in an email. “Getting the balance wrong and hiking interest rates too aggressively could see recession fears become a reality.”  Crypto traders and analysts are remaining similarly bearish. FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in a note Tuesday that market sentiment remained in “extreme fear” mode as bitcoin saw its biggest decline since early 2020.  Kuptsikevich added that bitcoin prices could tumble to 2017 highs under $20,000 before long-term buyers return to the market, and provided macroeconomic sentiment improves.  Bradley Duke, co-CEO at crypto exchange-traded product provider ETC Group, also stated bitcoin could retest 2017’s levels with the “next major support” at “$20,000.” “Crypto markets are in extreme fear mode, with the only recent comparable period of extended low sentiment stretching back to March 2020,” he said.  Meanwhile, some investors said a decline in bitcoin prices was tied to a rout in global stocks.  “The global economic environment is becoming extremely tough to navigate for investors involved in all kinds of markets, so it is no surprise that bitcoin is also facing increased downward pressure,” said Mikkel Morch, executive director at crypto/digital asset hedge fund ARK36. He added: “Over the past couple of years, cryptocurrencies have become a global macro asset and so it is to be expected that they will react negatively now when investors realize that central banks haven’t reacted nearly as aggressively as they will need to in order to get inflation under control.”  Technician's take  Pussy Riot, Political Action and the Future of DAOs  Growing up, Nadya Tolokonnikova, one of the founders of protest collective Pussy Riot, wanted to be a feminist. That’s what the 32-year-old artist and punk rocker told CoinDesk at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas.  Pussy Riot, Tolokonnikova explained while sitting on the floor of the Austin Convention Center, is often mistakenly thought of as just a punk-rock outfit – one that first made headlines in 2012 for its anti-Putin anthems. But the group, which operates like an off-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), is so much more.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “Anyone can join Pussy Riot,” Tolokonnikova said on the Big Ideas stage on Saturday. “We're open source, we write our own code … We’re decentralized, we’re autonomous and we’re an organization.”  The artistic, political collective – which counts over 100 members, of which a punk band is just a small part – is working toward a more equal world. Over the past decade, Pussy Riot has founded media companies, published books and staged protests on and offline to further their “global feminist protest art movement.”  See also: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity) | Opinion  Lately, the group has been using the censorship-resistant tools enabled by crypto. Tolokonnikova was a co-founder of women and LGBTQ+ activist group Unicorn DAO. She also helped found Ukraine DAO, which auctioned an image of the Ukrainian flag in March for 2,258 ETH (approximately $6.75 million at the time) to support people affected by the Russian invasion.  “My goal is for future generations that are going to be onboarding into Web 3 … will have gender equality,” Tolokonnikova said. “This is how I see my role in crypto.”  Last week, as the Consensus event was unfolding a few blocks to the south, members of Pussy Riot, UnicornDAO and the Lakota Indigenous group Ikiya Collective charged into the Texas State Capitol building to stage a protest.  They unfurled a 45-foot banner reading “MATRIARCHY NOW!” from the third floor and then rushed out of the building. The moment of “domination” was minted as a non-fungible token (NFT) using auction platform Party Bid. To date, the group has raised 2.38980764 ETH – worth just shy of $3,000 – from 23 contributors to fund reproductive rights.  John Caldwell, a founder of Unicorn, said the group was “surprised” by how little attention and support this protest action has received. Texas, a U.S. state known for supporting the ideals of autonomy, personal freedom and limited state intervention, has been at the forefront of the conservative-led charge to roll back abortion rights, he said.  “I didn’t come here for the conference, I came here to protest,” Tolokonnikova said, adding that the crowdfunding model allows anyone who’s so inclined to contribute dollars or cents to their cause. Decrypt reported “mixed reactions,” with some Capitol building visitors snapping pictures and others hurrying out of the way.  Though she’s similarly taken aback by how little buzz the Capitol publicity stunt generated, Tolokonnikova said crypto is full of energy. “A lot of people here are visionaries. They want to build a better world,” she said.  Perhaps no one knows better than Tolokonnikova how much work goes on behind the scenes at activist causes. She said she splits her time doing logistical work for the DAO – answering emails, participating in her Discord channels, speaking to artists and auction houses – and planning showstopping events.  As co-founder of independent media outlet Mediazona, she has spoken before the U.S. Congress, British Parliament, European Parliament and performed at Banksy's Dismaland exhibition.  See also: DAOs and the Coming InDAOstrial Revolution | Opinion  At an earlier Consensus event on the Big Ideas stage, Ellie Rennie, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) professor and head of the Australian university’s Blockchain Innovation Hub, said DAOs are a new type of organization that will require a new mix of interpersonal and technological skills to get right.  She noted that we should also not vilify DAOs that experiment and fail. “To be transient is OK,” she said. “We need to find what makes communities resilient.”  Perhaps the hardest task for DAO managers, faced with a tool that adds elements of financialization and speculation to social causes, is creating ways to “align” everyone’s needs. Economic incentives may encourage participation, but perhaps not commitment.  Others come to crypto precisely because it is apolitical – a space that seems insulated from the dramas, inconsistencies and superficialities of modern-day politics. Crypto, by creating tools that anyone can use, has a plausible case for being “credibly neutral.”  Of course, some would disagree. Perhaps crypto will only rebound from the unfolding bear market if it finds a way to meaningfully engage with the world. In politics, perhaps that means crypto becoming an effective tool for change.  “Being apolitical there is no such thing,” Tolokonnikova said. “Apolitical just means supporting players that are already in power.”  Important events  U.S. Federal Reserve meeting  Australia House Price Index (Q1/QoQ/YoY)  10 a.m. HKT/SGT(2 a.m. UTC): China industrial production (May/YoY  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Deep Crypto Sell-Off, Coinbase Layoffs, Celsius Pausing Withdrawals, All Eyes on Fed as Investors Fear What’s Next  Crypto market capitalization fell by some 12% in the last 24 hours to nearly $970 billion on Monday morning amid fears over aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes.
